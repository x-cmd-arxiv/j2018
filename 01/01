By using an adiabatic perturbation\ntheory in the parameter $g_{12}/{g}$, we show that, contrary to the case of two\nsolitons in scalar condensates, the interactions between solitons are\nattractive when the interparticle interactions between condensates are\nrepulsive $g_{12}>0$. As a result, the relative motion of dark solitons with\nequal chemical potential $\\mu$ is well approximated by harmonic oscillations of\nangular frequency $w_r=(\\mu/\\hbar)\\sqrt{({8}/{15}){g_{12}}/{g}}$. We also show\nthat in finite systems, the resonance of this anomalous excitation mode with\nthe spin density mode of lowest energy gives rise to alternating dynamical\ninstability and stability fringes as a function of the perturbative parameter.\nIn the presence of harmonic trapping (with angular frequency $\\Omega$) the\nsolitons are driven by the superposition of two harmonic motions at a frequency\ngiven by $w^2=(\\Omega/\\sqrt{2})^2+w_r^2$. When $g_{12}<0$, these two\noscillators compete to give rise to an overall effective potential that can be\neither single well or double well through a pitchfork bifurcation. All our\ntheoretical results are compared with numerical solutions of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation for the dynamics and the Bogoliubov equations for the\nlinear stability. A good agreement is found between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 16:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

The two hypotheses correspond to\ndifferent levels of correlation between the two source components, i.e., the\ncrossover probability between the two. The terminals communicate with a\ndecision function via rate-limited noiseless links. We analyze the tradeoff\nbetween the exponential decay of the two error probabilities associated with\nthe hypothesis test and the communication rates. We first consider the\nside-information setting where one encoder is allowed to send the full\nsequence. For this setting, previous work exploits the fact that a decoding\nerror of the source does not necessarily lead to an erroneous decision upon the\nhypothesis. We provide improved achievability results by carrying out a tighter\nanalysis of the effect of binning error; the results are also more complete as\nthey cover the full exponent tradeoff and all possible correlations.

As a result the mirror doublet\nelectrons can have masses in the keV order, becoming the warm dark matter\ncomponent of this model. The cold dark matter component comes from the mirror\nnucleons that can have mass larger than the ordinary nucleons. The Big Bang\nNucleosynthesys constraint can be avoided by a large entropy production in the\nordinary sector due to a slow decay of mirror singlet electrons. The\ntemperature ratio of the two sectors is approximately proportional to the ratio\nof the VEV's of the ordinary and mirror Higgs, and this also will determine the\ncold-warm dark matter contribution to the cosmic energy density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 17:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Once the quasi-potential with respect\nto an attractor of the corresponding deterministic system is found, one can\nreadily obtain maximum likelihood exit paths and estimate the exit rate from\nthe basin of attraction and the invariant probability density near the\nattractor. The quasi-potential for a linear SDE with asymptotically stable\nequilibrium at the origin is a quadratic form whose matrix was found by Z. Chen\nand M. Freidlin (2005). Their formula involves an integral of certain matrix\nexponentials and is inconvenient for numerical evaluation. In this work, I\npropose a different approach for constructing the quasi-potential matrix for\nlinear SDEs based on a certain easy-to-obtain hierarchy of orthogonal\ndecompositions inspired by those used by M. Tao (2018). A number of properties\nof these decompositions, named false quasi-potential decompositions, is\nestablished. A geometric recursive algorithm implementing this approach is\npresented. It involves only numerically stable sub-algorithms such as the\ncomputation of Schur decompositions and solving systems of linear equations or\nquadratic least squares problems. This work is motivated by the need to\ninitialize the quasi-potential solvers near asymptotically stable equilibria.\nAn accurate way to do it is to linearize the SDE near the equilibrium and set\nthe values of the quasi-potential at the neighboring mesh points to the exact\nquasi-potential of the linearized system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 17:57:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 15:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

Acoustic enclosures are typical\nexamples featuring locally reacting surfaces that respond to a pressure\ngradient or a pressure difference, alter the enclosure's volume and, hence, the\nboundary conditions, and do so locally through their vibrations. Accordingly,\nthe Laplace-Beltrami operator in the acoustic wave equation lives in a\ntemporally varying domain depending on the displacement of the locally reacting\nsurface from equilibrium. The resulting partial differential equations feature\nnonlinearities and are coupled though the time-dependent boundary conditions.\nThe solution to the afore-mentioned problem, as presented here, integrates\ntechniques from differential geometry, functional analysis, and physics. The\nappropriate space is shown to be a (perturbation) fiber bundle. In the context\nof a systematic perturbation theory, the solution to the dynamical problem is\nobtained from a combination of semigroup techniques for operator evolution\nequations and metric perturbation theory as used in AdS/CFT. Duhamel's\nprinciple then yields a time-dependent perturbation theory, called geometric\nperturbation theory. It is analogous to, though different from, both Dirac's\ntime-dependent perturbation theory and the Magnus expansion. Specifically, the\nformalism demonstrates that the stationary-domain approximation for vibrational\nacoustics only introduces a small error. Analytic simplifications methods are\nderived in the framework of the piston approximation. Globally reacting\nsurfaces (so-called pistons) replace the formerly locally reacting surfaces and\nreduce the number of independent variables in the underlying partial\ndifferential equations.

To achieve this, we establish new results for the rate of\nconvergence of iterated post-$L_2$-Boosting and orthogonal $L_2$-Boosting in a\nhigh-dimensional setting similar to Lasso, i.e., under approximate sparsity\nwithout assuming the beta-min condition. These results are extended to the 2SLS\nframework and valid inference is provided for treatment effect analysis. We\ngive extensive simulation results for the proposed methods and compare them\nwith Lasso. In an empirical application, we construct efficient IVs with our\nproposed methods to estimate the effect of pre-merger overlap of bank branch\nnetworks in the US on the post-merger stock returns of the acquirer bank.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 22:15:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 17:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

Multi-view clustering aims at generating better clusters by\nexploiting complementary and consistent information from multiple views rather\nthan relying on the individual view. Due to inevitable system errors caused by\ndata-captured sensors or others, the data in each view may be erroneous.\nVarious types of errors behave differently and inconsistently in each view.\nMore precisely, error could exhibit as noise and corruptions in reality.\nUnfortunately, none of the existing multi-view clustering approaches handle all\nof these error types. Consequently, their clustering performance is\ndramatically degraded. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain method\nfor Error-Robust Multi-View Clustering (EMVC). By decomposing each view into a\nshared transition probability matrix and error matrix and imposing structured\nsparsity-inducing norms on error matrices, we characterize and handle typical\ntypes of errors explicitly. To solve the challenging optimization problem, we\npropose a new efficient algorithm based on Augmented Lagrangian Multipliers and\nprove its convergence rigorously. Experimental results on various synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show the superiority of the proposed EMVC method over the\nbaseline methods and its robustness against different types of errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 02:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

First, for a single-user mmWave\nsystem employing distributed antenna subarray architecture in which the\ntransmitter and receiver consist of Kt and Kr subarrays, respectively, a\ndiversity gain theorem is established when the numbers of antennas at subarrays\ngo to infinity. Specifically, assuming that all subchannels have the same\nnumber of propagation paths L, the theorem states that by employing such a\ndistributed antenna-subarray architecture, a diversity gain of KrKtL-Ns+1 can\nbe achieved, where Ns is the number of data streams. This result means that\ncompared to the co-located antenna architecture, using the distributed\nantenna-subarray architecture can scale up the diversity gain or multiplexing\ngain proportionally to KrKt. The diversity gain analysis is then extended to\nthe multiuser scenario as well as the scenario with conventional\npartially-connected RF structure in the literature.

Information theoretically, the downlink of a C-RAN is modeled as a\ntwo-hop broadcast-relay network. Among the various transmission and relaying\nstrategies for such model, this paper focuses on the compression strategy, in\nwhich the CP centrally encodes the signals to be broadcasted jointly by the\nBSs, then compresses and sends these signals to the BSs through the fronthaul\nlinks. This paper characterizes an achievable rate region for a generalized\ncompression strategy with Marton's multicoding for broadcasting and\nmultivariate compression for fronthaul transmission. We then compare this rate\nregion with the distributed decode-forward (DDF) scheme, which achieves the\ncapacity of the general relay networks to within a constant gap, and show that\nthe difference lies in that DDF performs Marton's multicoding and multivariate\ncompression jointly as opposed to successively as in the compression strategy.\nA main result of this paper is that under the assumption that the fronthaul\nlinks are subject to a \\emph{sum} capacity constraint this difference is\nimmaterial, so the successive encoding based compression strategy can already\nachieve the capacity region of the C-RAN to within a constant gap, where the\ngap is independent of the channel parameters and the power constraints at the\nBSs.

We find no evidence for\nalkali absorption features, nor evidence of a scattering slope longward of 0.53\nmicrons. The spectrum is indicative of moderate to high metallicity (~100-1000x\nsolar) while moderate metallicity scenarios (~100x solar) require aerosol\nopacity. The optical spectrum also rules out some highly scattering haze\nmodels. We find an increase in transit depth around 0.8 microns in the\ntransmission spectra of 3 different sub-Jovian exoplanets (GJ 436b, HAT-P-26b,\nand GJ 1214b). While most of the data come from STIS, data from three other\ninstruments may indicate this is not an instrumental effect.

We aim to characterize the capacity region of\nthis new type of BC over a given UAV flight duration, by jointly optimizing the\nUAV's trajectory and transmit power/rate allocations over time, subject to the\nUAV's maximum speed and maximum transmit power constraints. First, to draw\nessential insights, we consider two special cases with asymptotically large/low\nUAV flight duration/speed, respectively. For the former case, it is shown that\na simple hover-fly-hover (HFH) UAV trajectory with time division multiple\naccess (TDMA) based orthogonal multiuser transmission is capacity-achieving,\nwhile in the latter case, the UAV should hover at a fixed location that is\nnearer to the user with larger achievable rate and in general superposition\ncoding (SC) based non-orthogonal transmission with interference cancellation at\nthe receiver of the nearer user is required. Next, we consider the general case\nwith finite UAV speed and flight duration. We show that the optimal UAV\ntrajectory should follow a general HFH structure, i.e., the UAV successively\nhovers at a pair of initial and final locations above the line segment of the\ntwo users each with a certain amount of time and flies unidirectionally between\nthem at the maximum speed, and SC is generally needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 13:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 06:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

More specifically, we quantify how\nthe supply and demand for taxi services, the underlying road network, and the\npublic acceptance of taxi ridesharing (TRS) affect the optimal number of taxis\nfor a particular city, as well as commuters' average waiting time and trip\ntime. Results reveal certain universal features of the taxi dynamics with\nreal-time taxi-booking---that there is a well-defined transition between the\noversaturated phase when demand exceeds supply, and the undersaturated phase\nwhen supply exceeds demand. The boundary between the two phases gives the\noptimal number of taxis a city should accommodate, given the specific demand,\nroad network and commuter habits. Adding or removing taxis may affect commuter\nexperience very differently in the two phases revealed. In the oversaturated\nphase the average waiting time is affected exponentially, while in the\nundersaturated phase it is affected sub-linearly.
