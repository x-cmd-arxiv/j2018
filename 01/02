AR 12192 was the largest region of Solar Cycle 24; it\nunderwent noticeable growth and produced 6 X-class flares, 22 M-class flares,\nand 53 C-class flares in the course of its disc passage. However, the most\npeculiar fact of this AR is that it was associated with only one CME in spite\nof producing several X-class flares. In this work, we carry out a comparative\nstudy between the eruptive and non-eruptive flares produced by AR 12192. We\nfind that the magnitude of abrupt and permanent changes in the horizontal\nmagnetic field and Lorentz force are significantly smaller in the case of the\nconfined flares compared to the eruptive one. We present the areal evolution of\nAR 12192 during its disc passage. We find the flare-related morphological\nchanges to be weaker during the confined flares, whereas the eruptive flare\nexhibits a rapid and permanent disappearance of penumbral area away from the\nmagnetic neutral line after the flare. Furthermore, from the extrapolated\nnonlinear force-free magnetic field, we examine the overlying coronal magnetic\nenvironment over the eruptive and non-eruptive zones of the AR. We find that\nthe critical decay index for the onset of torus instability was achieved at a\nlower height over the eruptive flaring region, than for the non-eruptive core\narea. These results suggest that the decay rate of the gradient of overlying\nmagnetic field strength may play a decisive role to determine the CME\nproductivity of the AR. In addition, the magnitude of changes in the\nflare-related magnetic characteristics are found to be well correlated with the\nnature of solar eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 16:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

We also find rotating\nsolutions to these systems and analyse their thermodynamics. First we consider\nthe static case with a spherically symmetric source for both the vector and\nscalar (tensor) unparticles. We obtain thus analytical expressions to the\nprincipal thermodynamic quantities: Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity\nand free energy. For the scalar (tensor) case we find that the black hole\npresents a residual value for the entropy when its radius goes to zero but the\nother thermodynamic quantities give, for any horizon radius, a\nthermodynamically unstable behavior similar to the standard black hole. For the\nvector case we find a richer structure in the region in which the horizon\nradius is less than the characteristic length of the unparticle theory. We\nidentify a phase transition and a region where the black hole can be\nthermodynamically stable. Following, we show that the mentioned modifications\nin the standard gravity are formally similar to those ones present in the black\nholes with quintessence. With this we also show, notwithstanding, that the\nunparticles cannot be a source of quintessence.

Through the use of generating\nfunctions, this provided an answer to the longstanding open question of\nenumerating the (unlabeled) interval orders. A semiorder is an interval order\nhaving a representation in which all intervals have the same length.

From this description, we are able to determine the ordinary\ngenerating for the semiorders of dimension at most 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 19:58:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 14:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

Firstly, a new charging and discharging (C/D) strategy\nbased on Binary Search Method is designed for ES, which responds to system\ncongestion cost over time. Then, a novel pricing method, based on Location\nMarginal Pricing, is designed for ES. The pricing model is derived by\nevaluating ES impact on the network power flows and congestion from the loss\nand congestion components in Location Marginal Pricing. The impact is then\nconverted into an hourly economic signal to reflect ES operation. The proposed\nES C/D strategy and pricing methods are validated on a real local Grid Supply\nPoint area.

The\nstandard way to training these models resorts to an iterative unsupervised\nprocedure based on Gibbs sampling, called 'contrastive divergence' (CD), and\nadditional supervised tuning via back-propagation. However, this procedure has\nbeen shown not to follow any gradient and can lead to suboptimal solutions. In\nthis paper, we show an efficient alternative to CD by means of simulations of\ndigital memcomputing machines (DMMs). We test our approach on pattern\nrecognition using a modified version of the MNIST data set. DMMs sample\neffectively the vast phase space given by the model distribution of the RBM,\nand provide a very good approximation close to the optimum. This efficient\nsearch significantly reduces the number of pretraining iterations necessary to\nachieve a given level of accuracy, as well as a total performance gain over CD.\nIn fact, the acceleration of pretraining achieved by simulating DMMs is\ncomparable to, in number of iterations, the recently reported hardware\napplication of the quantum annealing method on the same network and data set.\nNotably, however, DMMs perform far better than the reported quantum annealing\nresults in terms of quality of the training. We also compare our method to\nadvances in supervised training, like batch-normalization and rectifiers, that\nwork to reduce the advantage of pretraining. We find that the memcomputing\nmethod still maintains a quality advantage ($>1\\%$ in accuracy, and a $20\\%$\nreduction in error rate) over these approaches. Furthermore, our method is\nagnostic about the connectivity of the network. Therefore, it can be extended\nto train full Boltzmann machines, and even deep networks at once.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 21:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 01:33:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Density functional theory\ncalculations suggest that upon compression, the two-layer graphene film\ntransforms into a diamond-like film, producing both elastic deformations and\nsp2-to-sp3 chemical changes.

The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) provides a\npractical implementation of the statistical solution of the data assimilation\nproblem and has gained wide popularity as. This success can be attributed to\nits simple formulation and ease of implementation. EnKF is a Monte-Carlo\nalgorithm that solves the data assimilation problem by sampling the probability\ndistributions involved in Bayes theorem. Because of this, all flavors of EnKF\nare fundamentally prone to sampling errors when the ensemble size is small. In\ntypical weather forecasting applications, the model state space has dimension\n$10^{9}-10^{12}$, while the ensemble size typically ranges between $30-100$\nmembers. Sampling errors manifest themselves as long-range spurious\ncorrelations and have been shown to cause filter divergence. To alleviate this\neffect covariance localization dampens spurious correlations between state\nvariables located at a large distance in the physical space, via an empirical\ndistance-dependent function. The quality of the resulting analysis and forecast\nis greatly influenced by the choice of the localization function parameters,\ne.g., the radius of influence. The localization radius is generally tuned\nempirically to yield desirable results.This work, proposes two adaptive\nalgorithms for covariance localization in the EnKF framework, both based on a\nmachine learning approach.

Here, clustering refers to the problem of\npartitioning some input metric measure space (mm-space) into k clusters,\nminimizing some objective function f. Sketching, on the other hand, is the\nproblem of approximating some mm-space by a smaller one supported on a set of k\npoints. Specifically, we define the k-sketch of some mm-space M to be the\nnearest neighbor of M in the set of k-point mm-spaces, under some distance\nfunction \\rho on the set of mm-spaces. In this paper, we demonstrate a duality\nbetween general classes of clustering and sketching problems. We present a\ngeneral method for efficiently transforming a solution for a clustering problem\nto a solution for a sketching problem, and vice versa, with approximately equal\ncost. More specifically, we obtain the following results. 1. For metric spaces,\nwe consider the case where the clustering objective is minimizing the maximum\ncluster diameter. We show that the ratio between the sketching and clustering\nobjectives is constant over compact metric spaces. 2. We extend these results\nto the setting of metric measure spaces where we prove that the ratio of\nsketching to clustering objectives is bounded both above and below by some\nuniversal constants. In this setting, the clustering objective involves\nminimizing various notions of the l_p-diameters} of the clusters. 3.

The geometrical and topological properties of the phase space of\nspin$-1$ quantum states is richer than that of spin$-1/2$ quantum states and is\nrelatively unexplored. For instance, the spin vector of a spin-1 system, unlike\nthat of a spin$-1/2$ system, can lie anywhere on or inside the Bloch sphere\nrepresenting the phase space. Recently, a generalization of Berry's phase that\nencapsulates the topology of spin-1 quantum states has been formulated in J.\nMath. Phys., 59(6), 062105.

As\nthe Web information grows, recently some works try to explore financial news to\nimprove the prediction. Effective indicators, e.g., the events related to the\nstocks and the people's sentiments towards the market and stocks, have been\nproved to play important roles in the stocks' volatility, and are extracted to\nfeed into the prediction models for improving the prediction accuracy. However,\na major limitation of previous methods is that the indicators are obtained from\nonly a single source whose reliability might be low, or from several data\nsources but their interactions and correlations among the multi-sourced data\nare largely ignored.\n  In this work, we extract the events from Web news and the users' sentiments\nfrom social media, and investigate their joint impacts on the stock price\nmovements via a coupled matrix and tensor factorization framework.\nSpecifically, a tensor is firstly constructed to fuse heterogeneous data and\ncapture the intrinsic relations among the events and the investors' sentiments.\nDue to the sparsity of the tensor, two auxiliary matrices, the stock\nquantitative feature matrix and the stock correlation matrix, are constructed\nand incorporated to assist the tensor decomposition. The intuition behind is\nthat stocks that are highly correlated with each other tend to be affected by\nthe same event. Thus, instead of conducting each stock prediction task\nseparately and independently, we predict multiple correlated stocks\nsimultaneously through their commonalities, which are enabled via sharing the\ncollaboratively factorized low rank matrices between matrices and the tensor.\nEvaluations on the China A-share stock data and the HK stock data in the year\n2015 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 09:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

The lower bounds are achieved by\nschemes that meticulously combine joint cache-channel coding with wiretap\ncoding and key-aided one-time pads. The presented upper bound holds more\ngenerally for arbitrary degraded BCs and arbitrary cache sizes. When only weak\nreceivers have cache memories, upper and lower bounds coincide for small and\nlarge cache memories, thus providing the exact secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff\nfor this setup. The derived bounds allow to further conclude that the secrecy\ncapacity is positive even when the eavesdropper is stronger than all the\nlegitimate receivers with cache memories.

A decomposition-based EMO algorithm is\nusually designed to approximate a whole Pareto-optimal front (PF). However, in\npractice, the decision maker (DM) might only be interested in her/his region of\ninterest (ROI), i.e., a part of the PF. Solutions outside that might be useless\nor even noisy to the decision-making procedure. Furthermore, there is no\nguarantee to find the preferred solutions when tackling many-objective\nproblems. This paper develops an interactive framework for the\ndecomposition-based EMO algorithm to lead a DM to the preferred solutions of\nher/his choice. It consists of three modules, i.e., consultation, preference\nelicitation and optimization. Specifically, after every several generations,\nthe DM is asked to score a few candidate solutions in a consultation session.\nThereafter, an approximated value function, which models the DM's preference\ninformation, is progressively learned from the DM's behavior. In the preference\nelicitation session, the preference information learned in the consultation\nmodule is translated into the form that can be used in a decomposition-based\nEMO algorithm, i.e., a set of reference points that are biased toward to the\nROI. The optimization module, which can be any decomposition-based EMO\nalgorithm in principle, utilizes the biased reference points to direct its\nsearch process. Extensive experiments on benchmark problems with three to ten\nobjectives fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for\nfinding the DM's preferred solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 11:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 20:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Specular Andreev reflection (SAR) dominates when the position of\nthe Fermi energy in graphene is comparable to or smaller than the\nsuperconducting gap. Bilayer graphene (BLG) is an ideal candidate to observe\nthe crossover from retro to specular since the Fermi energy broadening near the\nDirac point is much weaker compared to monolayer graphene. Recently, the\nobservation of signatures of SAR in BLG have been reported experimentally by\nlooking at the enhancement of conductance at finite bias near the Dirac point.\nHowever, the signatures were not very pronounced possibly due to the\nparticipation of normal quasi-particles at bias energies close to the\nsuperconducting gap. Here, we propose a scheme to observe the features of\nenhanced SAR even at zero bias at a normal metal (NM)-superconductor (SC)\njunction on BLG.

A prototype of such phenomenon are the quasi-one\ndimensional (TMTTF)$_2X$ Fabre-salts. However, the stabilization of a\nlong-range ferroelectric ground-state below $T_{co}$ requires the break of\ninversion symmetry, which should be accompanied by a lattice deformation. In\nthis work we investigate the role of the monovalent counter-anion $X$ in such\nmechanism. For this purpose, we measured the quasi-static dielectric constant\nalong the $c^{*}$-axis direction, where layers formed by donors and anions\nalternate. Our findings show that the ionic charge contribution is three orders\nof magnitude lower than the intra-stack electronic response. The $c^{*}$\ndielectric constant ($\\epsilon'_{c^*}$) probes directly the charge response of\nthe monovalent anion $X$, since the anion mobility in the structure should help\nto stabilize the ferroelectric ground-state. Furthermore, our $\\epsilon'_{c^*}$\nmeasurements %conjugated with earlier investigations of the $c^*$ lattice\nthermal expansion, show that the dielectric response is thermally broaden below\n$T_{co}$ if the ferroelectric transition occurs in the temperature range where\nthe anion movement begin to freeze in their methyl groups cavity. In the\nextreme case of the PF$_6$-H$_{12}$ salt, where $T_{co}$ occurs at the freezing\npoint, a relaxor-type ferroelectricity is observed. Also, because of the slow\nkinetics of the anion sub-lattice, global hysteresis effects and reduction of\nthe charge response upon successive cycling are observed. In this context, we\npropose that anions control the order-disorder or relaxation character of the\nferroelectric transition of the Fabre-salts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 12:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-18"}

Despite this common\nsource, the latitudinal distribution of the two species is radically different,\nwith acetylene decreasing in abundance towards the pole, and ethane increasing\ntowards the pole. We present six years of NASA IRTF TEXES mid-infrared\nobservations of the zonally-averaged emission of methane, acetylene and ethane.\nWe confirm that the latitudinal distributions of ethane and acetylene are\ndecoupled, and that this is a persistent feature over multiple years.

The acetylene distributions are asymmetric on average, but as we\nmove from 2013 to 2017, the zonally-averaged abundance becomes more symmetric\nabout the equator. We suggest that both the short term changes in acetylene and\nits latitudinal asymmetry is driven by changes to the vertical stratospheric\nmixing, potentially related to propagating wave phenomena. Unlike acetylene,\nethane has a symmetric distribution about the equator that increases toward the\npole, with a peak mole fraction of $\\sim$18 ppm at about $\\pm50^{\\circ}$\nlatitude, with a minimum at the equator of $\\sim$10 ppm at 1 mbar. [...] The\nequator-to-pole distributions of acetylene and ethane are consistent with\nacetylene having a shorter lifetime than ethane that is not sensitive to longer\nadvective timescales, but is augmented by short-term dynamics, such as vertical\nmixing. Conversely, the long lifetime of ethane allows it to be transported to\nhigher latitudes faster than it can be chemically depleted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 14:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Consequently, the reservoir\nmodels used for production optimization are subject to significant uncertainty.\nTo minimize the associated risk, the oil literature has mainly used\nensemble-based methods to optimize sample estimated risk measures of net\npresent value (NPV). However, the success in reducing risk critically depends\non the choice of risk measure. As a systematic approach to risk mitigation in\nproduction optimization, this paper characterizes proper risk measures by the\naxioms of coherence and aversion. As an example of a proper measure, we\nconsider conditional value-at-risk, $\\text{CVaR}_{\\alpha}$, at different risk\nlevels, $\\alpha$. The potential of $\\text{CVaR}_{\\alpha}$ to minimize profit\nloss is demonstrated by a simulated case study. The case study compares\n$\\text{CVaR}_{\\alpha}$ to real-world best practices, represented by reactive\ncontrol. It shows that for any risk level, $\\alpha$, we may find an optimized\nstrategy that provides lower risk than reactive control. However, despite\noverall lower risk, we see that all optimized strategies still yield some\nunacceptable low profit realizations relative to reactive control. To remedy\nthis, we introduce a risk mitigation method based on the NPV offset\ndistribution. Unlike existing methods of the oil literature, the offset risk\nmitigation approach minimizes the risk relative to a reference strategy\nrepresenting common real-life practices, e.g. reactive control. In the\nsimulated case study, we minimize the worst case profit offset to reduce the\nrisk of realizations that do worse than the reactive strategy. The results\nsuggest that it may be more relevant to consider the NPV offset distribution\nthan the NPV distribution when minimizing risk in production optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 15:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Interplanetary (IP) shocks are known to be accelerators of energetic\ncharged particles observed in-situ in the heliosphere. However, the\nacceleration of near-relativistic electrons by shocks in the interplanetary\nmedium is often questioned. On 9 August 2011 a Corotating Interaction Region\n(CIR) passed STEREO B (STB) that resulted in a flux increase in the electron\nand ion channels of the Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT).

The existence of the operator analogues of doubly stochastic scalings\nof matrices is equivalent to a multitude of problems in computer science and\nmathematics, such rational identity testing in non-commuting variables,\nnoncommutative rank of symbolic matrices, and a basic problem in invariant\ntheory (Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira and Wigderson, FOCS, 2016).\n  We study operator scaling with specified marginals, which is the operator\nanalogue of scaling matrices to specified row and column sums. We characterize\nthe operators which can be scaled to given marginals, much in the spirit of the\nGurvits' algorithmic characterization of the operators that can be scaled to\ndoubly stochastic (Gurvits, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 2004). Our\nalgorithm produces approximate scalings in time poly(n,m) whenever scalings\nexist. A central ingredient in our analysis is a reduction from the specified\nmarginals setting to the doubly stochastic setting.\n  Operator scaling with specified marginals arises in diverse areas of study\nsuch as the Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, communication complexity, eigenvalues\nof sums of Hermitian matrices, and quantum information theory. Some of the\nknown theorems in these areas, several of which had no effective proof, are\nstraightforward consequences of our characterization theorem. For instance, we\nobtain a simple algorithm to find, when they exist, a tuple of Hermitian\nmatrices with given spectra whose sum has a given spectrum. We also prove new\ntheorems such as a generalization of Forster's theorem (Forster, Journal of\nComputer and System Sciences, 2002) concerning radial isotropic position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 22:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 05:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

We\npropose to have centralized network functions in the 5G network core to control\nthe network, end-to-end. This is achieved by relocating the control\nfunctionality present in the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) to the network core,\nresulting in the conversion of the base station known as the gNB into a pure\ndata plane node. This brings about a significant reduction in signaling costs\nbetween the RAN and the core network. It also results in improved system\nperformance. The merits of our proposal have been illustrated by evaluating the\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the 5G network, such as network attach\n(registration) time and handover time.
