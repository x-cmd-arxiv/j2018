Very recently, gapped domain walls between different\ntopological phases have been intensively studied. In this paper, we\nsystematically construct a large class of lattice models for gapless domain\nwalls between twisted and untwisted gauge theories with arbitrary finite group\n$G$. As simple examples, we numerically study several finite groups(including\nboth Abelian and non-Abelian finite group such as $S_3$) in $2$D using the\nstate-of-the-art loop optimization of tensor network renormalization algorithm.\nWe also propose a physical mechanism for understanding the gapless nature of\nthese particular domain wall models. Finally, by taking advantage of the\nclassification and construction of twisted gauge theories using group\ncohomology theory, we generalize such constructions into arbitrary dimensions,\nwhich might provide us a systematical way to understand gapless domain walls\nand topological quantum phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 16:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 03:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

For rocky exoplanets with 10-1000x Earth's H2O\nbut without H2, we model the multi-Gyr evolution of ocean temperature and\nchemistry, taking into account C partitioning, high-pressure ice phases, and\natmosphere-lithosphere exchange. Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find\nthat: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean\nchemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many\nwaterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to\nprevious claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical\ncycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C\nexchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by\nseafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass\nand ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our\nmodel, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early\nwater-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of\nmagnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory\noverlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the \"sweet spot\" (0.2-20 bar) for\nwhich the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as\nwide as it can be. Because the width of the HZ in semimajor axis defines (for\nSun-like stars) the maximum possible time span of surface habitability, this\neffect allows for Gyr of habitability as the star brightens. We illustrate our\nfindings by using the output of an ensemble of N-body simulations as input to\nour waterworld evolution code. Thus (for the first time in an end-to-end\ncalculation) we show that chance variation of initial conditions, with no need\nfor geochemical cycling, can yield multi-Gyr surface habitability on\nwaterworlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 17:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 21:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

Energy from feedback grows relative to the\nbinding energy of a halo toward lower mass resulting in greater deviations from\nHSE. Tangential motions comprise the largest deviation from HSE in L* haloes\nindicating that the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) has significant sub-\ncentrifugal rotation and angular momentum spin parameters 2-3x higher than the\ndark matter spin parameters. Thermal feedback can buoyantly rise to the outer\nCGM of M_200<10^12 Msol haloes, both moving baryons beyond R_200 and feeding\nuncorrelated tangential motions. The resulting hot halo density and rotation\nprofiles show promising agreement with X-ray observations of the inner Milky\nWay halo, and we discuss future observational prospects to detect spinning hot\nhaloes around other galaxies. Acceleration and radial streaming motions also\ncomprise significant deviations from HSE, especially net outward accelerations\nseen in L* and group haloes indicating active feedback. Black hole feedback\nacts in a preventative manner during the later growth of group haloes, applying\nsignificant accelerations via shocks that do not feed tangential motions. We\nargue that HSE is a poor assumption for the CGM, especially in the inner\nregions, and rotating baryonic hot haloes are a critical consideration for\nanalytic models of the CGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 21:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

A complementary approach is to investigate type Ia supernova rates in\nindividual, more nearby, galaxies. The popular A+B model for the specific\nsupernova rate, while reliable for a wide range of galaxy properties, diverges\nfor large specific star formation rates. Applying it outside its range of\nvalidity could lead to the prediction of excessive type Ia supernova rates.\nMoreover, the A+B model it is not directly derived from a delay time\ndistribution. We here introduce a new model which is explicitly motivated by a\nsimple delay time distribution composed of a prompt and a delayed component.\nThe model is in remarkably good agreement with current observational\nconstraints.

We assess the stability of mass transfer from a carbon-oxygen\nwhite dwarf onto compact objects of various masses, and conclude that for mass\ntransfer to proceed stably the accretor must, in fact, be a black hole.

Although many mechanisms such as the Laplace and\nGaussian mechanisms can be extended to a matrix-valued query function by adding\ni.i.d. noise to each element of the matrix, this method is often suboptimal as\nit forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typically\nassociated with matrix analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\ndifferential privacy mechanism called the Matrix-Variate Gaussian (MVG)\nmechanism, which adds a matrix-valued noise drawn from a matrix-variate\nGaussian distribution, and we rigorously prove that the MVG mechanism preserves\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy. Furthermore, we introduce the concept\nof directional noise made possible by the design of the MVG mechanism.\nDirectional noise allows the impact of the noise on the utility of the\nmatrix-valued query function to be moderated. Finally, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the performance of our mechanism using three matrix-valued queries\non three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find that the MVG mechanism notably\noutperforms four previous state-of-the-art approaches, and provides comparable\nutility to the non-private baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 20:24:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 21:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

It is further shown that the optimum number of\nfog nodes does not increase in direct proportion to the increase in the total\nnumber of nodes.

Here the backward Euler method is combined with a mixed finite\nelement method scheme, which results in a stable and locally mass-conservative\nscheme. At the same time, at each time step one has to solve a non-linear\nalgebraic system, for which linear iterations are needed. Finding robust and\nconvergent ones is particularly challenging here, since both slow and fast\ndiffusion cases are allowed.\n  Commonly used schemes, like Newton and Picard iterations, are defined either\nfor non-degenerate problems, or after regularising the problem in the case of\ndegenerate ones. Convergence is guaranteed only if the initial guess is\nsufficiently close to the solution, which translates into severe restrictions\non the time step.

Furthermore, the chemical functionalization was observed to drive\nthe self-organization of the nanoflakes into the nanopapers, leading to a 20%\nenhancement of the thermal conductivity for GnP-OH and E-GnP while the cross\nplane thermal conductivity was boosted by 150% in the case of E-GnP.

However, in this\n123 series, BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ is an exceptional member, with a magnetic order and\ncrystalline structure different from all others. Recently, an exciting\nexperiment reported the emergence of superconductivity in BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ at\nhigh pressure [J.-J. Ying, et al., Phys. Rev. B 95, 241109 (R) (2017)]. In this\npublication, we report a first principles study of BaFe$_2$Se$_3$. Our analysis\nunveils a variety of qualitative differences between BaFe$_2$S$_3$ and\nBaFe$_2$Se$_3$, including in the latter an unexpected chain of transitions with\nincreasing pressure. First, by gradually reducing the tilting angle of iron\nladders, the crystalline structure smoothly transforms from Pnma to Cmcm at ~6\nGPa. Second, the system becomes metallic at 10.4 GPa. Third, its unique ambient\npressure Block antiferromagnetic ground state is replaced by the more common CX\nantiferromagnetic order at ~12 GPa, the same magnetic state of the 123-S\nladder. This transition is found at a pressure very similar to the experimental\nsuperconducting transition. Finally, all magnetic moments vanish at 30 GPa.\nThis reported theoretical diagram of the complete phase evolution is important\nbecause of the technical challenges to capture many physical properties in\nhigh-pressure experiments. The information obtained in our calculations suggest\ndifferent characteristics for superconductivity in BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ and\nBaFe$_2$S$_3$: in 123-S pairing occurs when magnetic moments vanish, while in\n123-Se the transition region from Block- to CX-type magnetism appears to\ncatalyze superconductivity. Finally, an additional superconducting dome above\n~30 GPa is expected to occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 01:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-18"}

Specifically, the requests of one file is\nmodeled as a Poisson point process with finite lifetime, and two downlink\ntransmission modes are considered: (1) the base station multicasts file\nsegments to the requesting users and selected cache nodes; (2) the base station\nproactively multicasts file segments to the selected cache nodes without\nrequests from users. Hence the cache nodes with decoded files can help to\noffload the traffic upon the next file request via other air interfaces, e.g.\nWiFi. Without proactive caching placement, we formulate the downlink traffic\noffloading as a Markov decision process with random number of stages, and\npropose a revised Bellman's equation to obtain the optimal control policy. In\norder to address the prohibitively huge state space, we also introduce a\nlow-complexity sub-optimal solution based on linear approximation of the value\nfunctions, where the gap between the approximated value functions and the real\nones is bounded analytically.

In\nparticular, a strong ambiguity remains for the neutron shell closed $^{210}$Po\nnucleus regarding the role of shell effect in fission around $\\approx$ 30 - 40\nMeV of excitation energy. Purpose: We have measured the fission fragment mass\ndistribution of $^{210}$Po populated using fusion of $^{4}$He + $^{206}$Pb at\ndifferent excitation energies and compare the result with recent theoretical\npredictions as well as with our previous measurement for the same nucleus\npopulated through a different entrance channel. Mass distribution in the\nfission of the neighbouring nuclei $^{213}$At is also studied for comparison.\nMethods: Two large area Multi-wire Proportional Counters (MWPC) were used for\ncomplete kinematical measurement of the coincident fission fragments. The time\nof flight differences of the coincident fission fragments were used to directly\nextract the fission fragment mass distributions. Results: The measured fragment\nmass distribution for the reactions $^{4}$He + $^{206}$Pb and $^{4}$He +\n$^{209}$Bi were symmetric and the width of the mass distributions were found to\nincrease monotonically with excitation energy above 36.7 MeV and 32.9 MeV,\nrespectively, indicating the absence of shell effects at the saddle. However,\nin the fission of $^{210}$Po, we find minor deviation from symmetric mass\ndistributions at the lowest excitation energy (30.8 MeV). Conclusion:\nPersistence of shell effect in fission fragment mass distribution of $^{210}$Po\nwas observed at the excitation energy $\\approx$ 31 MeV as predicted by the\ntheory; at higher excitation energy, however, the present study reaffirms the\nabsence of any shell correction in the fission of $^{210}$Po.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 09:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}

First using a device\nlike an oscilloscope power traces are collected when the cryptographic device\nis doing the cryptographic operation. Then those traces are statistically\nanalysed using methods such as Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) to derive the\nsecret key of the system. Being possible to break Advanced Encryption Standard\n(AES) in few minutes, power analysis attacks have become a serious security\nissue for cryptographic devices such as smart card.\n  As the first phase of our project, we build a testbed for doing research on\npower analysis attacks. As power analysis is a practical type of attack in\norder to do any research, a testbed is the first requirement. Since building a\ntest bed is a complicated process, having a pre-built testbed would save the\ntime of future researchers. The second phase of our project is to attack the\nlatest cryptographic algorithm called Speck which has been released by National\nSecurity Agency (NSA) for use in embedded systems. In spite it has lot of\ndifferences to AES making impossible to directly use the power analysis\napproach used for AES, we introduce novel approaches to break Speck in less\nthan an hour. In the third phase of the project, we select few already\nintroduced countermeasures and practically attack them on our testbed to do a\ncomparative analysis. We show that software countermeasures such as random\ninstruction injection and randomly shuffling S-boxes are good enough for their\nsimplicity and cost. But we identify the possible threat due to the problem of\ngenerating a good seed for the pseudo-random algorithm running on the\nmicrocontroller. We attempt to address this issue by using a hardware-based\ntrue random generator that amplifies a random electrical signal and samples to\ngenerate a proper seed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 09:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}

Ionic liquids are viscous and therefore it is important\nto inspect rigorously whether the observed repulsive forces are indeed\nequilibrium forces or, rather, arise from the viscous force during drainage of\nthe fluid between two confining surfaces. In this paper we present our direct\nmeasurements of surface forces between mica sheets approaching in the ionic\nliquid [C2C1Im][NTf2], exploring three orders of magnitude in approach\nvelocity. Trajectories are systematically fitted by solving the equation of\nmotion, allowing us to disentangle the viscous and equilibrium contributions.\nFirst, we find that the drainage obeys classical hydrodynamics with a negative\nslip boundary condition in the range of the structural force, implying that a\nnm-thick portion of the liquid in the vicinity of the solid surface is composed\nof ordered molecules that do not contribute to the flow. Secondly, we show that\na long-range static force must indeed be invoked, in addition to the viscous\nforce, in order to describe the data quantitatively. This equilibrium\ninteraction decays exponentially and with decay length is in agreement with the\nscreening length reported for the same system in previous studies. In those\nstudies the decay was simply checked to be independent of velocity and measured\nat low approach rate, rather than explicitly taking account of viscous effects:\nwe explain why this gives indistinguishable outcomes for the screening length\nby noting that the viscous force is linear to very good approximation over a\nwide range of distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 11:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}

The problem is to maximize\nthe minimum (max-min) secrecy rate (SR) among all legitimate users, where the\ninformation signals at the FD-BS are accompanied with artificial noise to\ndebilitate the Eves' channels. To enhance the max-min SR, a major part of the\npower budget should be allocated to serve the users with poor channel\nqualities, such as those far from the FD-BS, undermining the SR for other\nusers, and thus compromising the SR per-user. In addition, the main obstacle in\ndesigning an FD system is due to the self-interference (SI) and co-channel\ninterference (CCI) among users.

This paper studies this phenomenon in theory under Gaussian\nrandom measurements. Different from previous studies, in this paper, we\nconsider convex programs with multiple prior constraints. These programs are\nencountered in many cases, for example, when the signal is sparse and its\n$\\ell_2$ norm is known beforehand, or when the signal is sparse and\nnon-negative simultaneously. Given such a convex program, to analyze its phase\ntransition, we introduce a new set and a new cone, called the prior restricted\nset and prior restricted cone, respectively. Our results reveal that the phase\ntransition of a convex problem occurs at the statistical dimension of its prior\nrestricted cone.

The\norigin of this phenomenon is debated, and its evolution with redshift is poorly\nconstrained. The observed GALEX FUV-NUV color can be used to probe the UV\nupturn approximately to redshift 0.5. AIMS: We provide constraints on the\nexistence of the UV upturn up to redshift $\\sim$ 0.4 in the brightest cluster\ngalaxies (BCG) located behind the Virgo cluster, using data from the GUViCS\nsurvey. METHODS:We estimate the GALEX far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observed\nmagnitudes for BCGs from the maxBCG catalog in the GUViCS fields. We increase\nthe number of nonlocal galaxies identified as BCGs with GALEX photometry from a\nfew tens of galaxies to 166 (64 when restricting this sample to relatively\nsmall error bars). We also estimate a central color within a 20 arcsec\naperture. By using the $r$-band luminosity from the maxBCG catalog, we can\nseparate blue FUV-NUV due to recent star formation and candidate upturn cases.\nWe use Lick indices to verify their similarity to redshift 0 upturn cases.\nRESULTS: We clearly detect a population of blue FUV-NUV BCGs in the redshift\nrange 0.10-0.35, vastly improving the existing constraints at these epochs by\nincreasing the number of galaxies studied, and by exploring a redshift range\nwith no previous data (beyond 0.2), spanning one more Gyr in the past. These\ngalaxies bring new constraints that can help distinguish between assumptions\nconcerning the stellar populations causing the UV upturn phenomenon. The\nexistence of a large number of UV upturns around redshift 0.25 favors the\nexistence of a binary channel among the sources proposed in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 13:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

Our focus is\non the effect of length polydispersity, which -- in the absence of a field --\nis known to produce a percolation threshold that scales with the inverse weight\naverage of the particle length. Using a model of non-interacting\nspherocylinders in conjunction with connectedness percolation theory, we show\nthat a quadrupolar field always increases the percolation threshold and that\nthe universal scaling with the inverse weight average no longer holds if the\nfield couples to the particle length.

Furthermore, by applying LCT to the images we clearly determine\ncounter-streaming flows in time series of 171 and 193\\AA\\ images. In the\n304\\AA\\ wavelength band, we only see minor indications for counter-streaming\nflows with LCT, while in the 211\\AA\\ wavelength band the counter-streaming\nflows are not detectable. The average horizontal flows reach mean flow speeds\nof 0.5 km/s. The highest horizontal flow speeds are identified in the 171\\AA\\\nband with flow speeds of up to 2.5 km/s.

Hence, in most cases, the resultant\ndifferential equation is discretized and approximated numerically. We know that\nmatter is discrete, so why all the circular work of taking a discrete\nphenomenon, putting a continuous model on it, and then discretizing this\ncontinuous model into something that is solvable? We do this because the sheer\nnumber of particles that make up any meaningful amount of matter is daunting\nand impossible to handle even with todays largest supercomputer. One discrete\napproach to deal with this problem is to group large numbers of particles\ntogether and treat them as individual units called quasimolecules.

The mathematical skills needed to set up such problems are much\nmore attainable than those needed to set up the differential equation, but the\nN-body problem that ensues usually requires a supercomputer to propagate it\nthrough time.

In particular, for a template of $2048$ bits,\nits effective statistical degree of freedom is about $342$ bits, which\ncoincides very well with the degree of freedom computed by the completely\ndifferent method proposed by Daugman.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 02:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

The weighted delta-tracking routine adds survival\nbiasing to normal delta-tracking, improving problem figure of merit. In the\noriginal formulation of this method, only absorption events were considered. We\nhave expanded the method to include scattering and investigated the method's\neffectiveness with two test cases: a pressurized water reactor pin cell and a\nfast reactor pin cell. We compare the figure of merit for calculating infinite\nflux and total cross-section while incrementally changing the amount of\nweighted delta-tracking used. We find that this new WDT routine has strong\npotential to improve the efficiency of fast reactor calculations, and may be\nuseful for light water reactor calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 22:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 17:02:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 17:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

The PA sensor is a standalone system controlled by a\nField-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The PA cell has been designed for flow\nnoise immunity using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The aim of\nthe CFD analysis was to investigate and minimize the influence of the gas\ndistribution and the flow noise on the PA signal. PA measurements were\nconducted at different flow rates by exciting molecular C-H stretch vibrational\nbands of hexane (C$_6$H$_{14}$) and decane (C$_{10}$H$_{22}$) molecules in\nclean air at 2950 cm$^{-1}$ (3.38 $\\mu$m) with a custom made mid-infrared\ninterband cascade laser (ICL). We observe a (1$\\sigma$, standard deviation)\nsensitivity of 0.4 $\\pm0.1$ ppb (nmol/mol) for hexane in clean air at flow\nrates up to 1.7 L/min, corresponding to a normalized noise equivalent\nabsorption (NNEA) coefficient of 2.5$\\times 10^{-9}$ W cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$,\ndemonstrating high sensitivity and fast real-time gas analysis. An Allan\ndeviation analysis for decane shows that the detection limit at optimum\nintegration time is 0.25 ppbV (nmol/mol).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2018 20:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}
