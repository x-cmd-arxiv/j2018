We discuss this BATV effect and estimate\nits magnitude for both time-dependent and time-independent cases. For the\ntime-dependent cases, we consider binaries that experience a change in orbital\ninclination, eccentric systems with and without apsidal motion, and\nhierarchical triple systems.

According to the Landau criterion, the critical phase\ngradients, both for mass and spin supercurrents, vanish at the phase transition\nfrom the easy-plane to the easy-axis anisotropy. However, mass superfluidity is\nstill possible at the phase transition. This is because the Landau criterion\nsignals instability only with respect to nonsingular vortices with special\nratio between circulations of mass and spin currents. Phase slips produced by\nthese vortices are not sufficient for complete decay of supercurrents. Full\ndecay of supercurrents requires phase slips with vortices of another\ntopological class and larger energy. These phase slips are suppressed by\nenergetic barriers up to the upper critical velocity (gradient) exceeding the\nLandau critical velocity.

A direct\ndiscretization of this phase space, often called the Eulerian approach, has\nmany advantages but is extremely expensive from a computational point of view.\nIn the present paper we propose a dynamical low-rank approximation to the\nVlasov--Poisson equation, with time integration by a particular splitting\nmethod. This approximation is derived by constraining the dynamics to a\nmanifold of low-rank functions via a tangent space projection and by splitting\nthis projection into the subprojections from which it is built. This reduces a\ntime step for the six- (or four-) dimensional Vlasov--Poisson equation to\nsolving two systems of three- (or two-) dimensional advection equations over\nthe time step, once in the position variables and once in the velocity\nvariables, where the size of each system of advection equations is equal to the\nchosen rank. By a hierarchical dynamical low-rank approximation, a time step\nfor the Vlasov--Poisson equation can be further reduced to a set of six (or\nfour) systems of one-dimensional advection equations, where the size of each\nsystem of advection equations is still equal to the rank. The resulting systems\nof advection equations can then be solved by standard techniques such as\nsemi-Lagrangian or spectral methods.

In contrast to the pre-accelerator era, when the ISA played an\nimportant role in verification by enabling a clean separation of concerns\nbetween software and hardware, verification of these \"accelerator-rich\" SoCs\npresents new challenges. From the perspective of hardware designers, there is a\nlack of a common framework for the formal functional specification of\naccelerator behavior. From the perspective of software developers, there exists\nno unified framework for reasoning about software/hardware interactions of\nprograms that interact with accelerators. This paper addresses these challenges\nby providing a formal specification and high-level abstraction for accelerator\nfunctional behavior. It formalizes the concept of an Instruction Level\nAbstraction (ILA), developed informally in our previous work, and shows its\napplication in modeling and verification of accelerators. This formal ILA\nextends the familiar notion of instructions to accelerators and provides a\nuniform, modular, and hierarchical abstraction for modeling software-visible\nbehavior of both accelerators and programmable processors.

The\ninterplay between topological order and the breaking of global symmetry is\ndescribed by the non-zero temperature statistical mechanics of classical XY\nmodels in dimension $D=3$; such models also describe the zero temperature\nquantum phases of bosons with short-range interactions on the square lattice at\ninteger filling. The topological state is again characterized by the expulsion\nof certain defects, in a state with fluctuating symmetry-breaking order, along\nwith the presence of emergent gauge fields. The phase diagrams of the $Z_2$\ngauge theory and the XY models are obtained by embedding them in U(1) gauge\ntheories, and by studying their Higgs and confining phases. These ideas are\nthen applied to the single-band Hubbard model on the square lattice. A SU(2)\ngauge theory describes the fluctuations of spin-density-wave order, and its\nphase diagram is presented by analogy to the XY models. We obtain a class of\nzero temperature metallic states with fluctuating spin-density wave order,\ntopological order associated with defect expulsion, deconfined emergent gauge\nfields, reconstructed Fermi surfaces (with `chargon' or electron-like\nquasiparticles), but no broken symmetry.

We discuss both equilibrium and dynamical\nproperties of the system that can be measured with ultracold atoms, including\nthe impurity spin susceptibility, the impurity spin relaxation rate, as well as\nthe equilibrium and dynamical spin correlations between the impurity and the\nferromagnetic bath atoms. We analyze the non-equilibrium time evolution of the\nsystem using a variational non-Gaussian approach, which allows us to explore\ncoherent dynamics over both short and long timescales, as set by the bandwidth\nand the Kondo singlet formation, respectively. In the quench-type experiments,\nwhen the Kondo interaction is suddenly switched on, we find that real-time\ndynamics shows crossovers reminiscent of poor man's renormalization group flow\nused to describe equilibrium systems. For bare easy-plane ferromagnetic\ncouplings, this allows us to follow the formation of the Kondo screening cloud\nas the dynamics crosses over from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic behavior.\nOn the other side of the phase diagram, our scheme makes it possible to measure\nquantum corrections to the well-known Korringa law describing the temperature\ndependence of the impurity spin relaxation rate. Theoretical results discussed\nin our paper can be measured using currently available experimental techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

It is generally accepted that\nthe ground state entanglement entropy for a region of linear size $L$ behaves\nas an area law with a subleading logarithm, $S = \\alpha L^2 -\\gamma \\log L$.\nWhile the logarithmic coefficient $\\gamma$ is believed to be universal, there\nhas been disagreement about its precise value. After carefully accounting for\nsubtle boundary corrections, multiple analyses in the high energy literature\nhave converged on an answer related to the conformal trace anomaly, which is\nonly sensitive to the local curvature of the partition. In contrast, a\ncondensed matter treatment of the problem yielded a topological contribution\nwhich is not captured by the conformal field theory calculation. In this\nperspective piece, we review aspects of the various calculations and discuss\nthe resolution of the discrepancy, emphasizing the important role played by\ncharged states (the \"extended Hilbert space\") in defining entanglement for a\ngauge theory. While the trace anomaly result is sufficient for a strictly pure\ngauge field, coupling the gauge field to dynamical charges of mass $m$ gives a\ntopological contribution to $\\gamma$ which survives even in the\n$m\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit. For many situations, the topological contribution\nfrom dynamical charges is physically meaningful and should be taken into\naccount. We also comment on other common issues of entanglement in gauge\ntheories, such as entanglement distillation, algebraic definitions of\nentanglement, and gauge-fixing procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 20:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2018 23:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 01:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory\nvalue that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try guess the destination\nand attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU\neither discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is\nunfaithful in how it executes, can access to the victim's memory and registers,\nand can perform operations with measurable side effects.\n  Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations\nthat would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the\nvictim's confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This\npaper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side channel\nattacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary\nmemory from the victim's process. More broadly, the paper shows that\nspeculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions\nunderpinning numerous software security mechanisms, including operating system\nprocess separation, static analysis, containerization, just-in-time (JIT)\ncompilation, and countermeasures to cache timing/side-channel attacks. These\nattacks represent a serious threat to actual systems, since vulnerable\nspeculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel,\nAMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices.\n  While makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some\ncases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as\nupdates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and\nsoftware developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU\nimplementations are (and are not) permitted to leak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 23:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

Mainstream fashion parsing models\nfocus on parsing the high-resolution and clean images. However, directly\napplying the parsers trained on benchmarks to a particular application scenario\nin the wild, e.g., a canteen, airport or workplace, often gives\nnon-satisfactory performance due to domain shift. In this paper, we explore a\nnew and challenging cross-domain human parsing problem: taking the benchmark\ndataset with extensive pixel-wise labeling as the source domain, how to obtain\na satisfactory parser on a new target domain without requiring any additional\nmanual labeling? To this end, we propose a novel and efficient cross-domain\nhuman parsing model to bridge the cross-domain differences in terms of visual\nappearance and environment conditions and fully exploit commonalities across\ndomains. Our proposed model explicitly learns a feature compensation network,\nwhich is specialized for mitigating the cross-domain differences. A\ndiscriminative feature adversarial network is introduced to supervise the\nfeature compensation to effectively reduce the discrepancy between feature\ndistributions of two domains. Besides, our model also introduces a structured\nlabel adversarial network to guide the parsing results of the target domain to\nfollow the high-order relationships of the structured labels shared across\ndomains. The proposed framework is end-to-end trainable, practical and scalable\nin real applications. Extensive experiments are conducted where LIP dataset is\nthe source domain and 4 different datasets including surveillance videos,\nmovies and runway shows are evaluated as target domains. The results\nconsistently confirm data efficiency and performance advantages of the proposed\nmethod for the cross-domain human parsing problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 06:55:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 03:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

These observations can also be used to investigate solar\nquiescent, active region, and flare properties. The MinXSS X-ray instruments\nconsist of a spectrometer, called X123, with a nominal 0.15 keV\nfull-width-half-maximum (FWHM) resolution at 5.9 keV and a broadband X-ray\nphotometer, called XP.

A description of the\nMinXSS instruments, performance capabilities, and relation to the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 0.1 - 0.8 nm flux are discussed in\nthis article.

Recently, Janus TMD Monolayer MoSSe with\nsandwiched S-Mo-Se structure has been synthesized by replacing the top S atomic\nlayer in $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$ with Se atoms. In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the phonon transport and lattice thermal conductivity ($\\kappa_L$)\nof MoSSe monolayer by first-principles calculations and linearized phonon\nBoltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA).\nCalculated results show that the $\\kappa_L$ of MoSSe monolayer is very lower\nthan that of $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer, and higher than that of\n$\\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayer. The corresponding sheet thermal conductance of\nMoSSe monolayer is 342.50 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ at room temperature. These can be\nunderstood by phonon group velocities and lifetimes. Compared with\n$\\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer, the smaller group velocities and shorter phonon\nlifetimes of MoSSe monolayer give rise to lower $\\kappa_L$. The larger group\nvelocities for MoSSe than $\\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayer is main reason of higher\n$\\kappa_L$. The elastic properties of $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$, MoSSe and\n$\\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayers are also calculated, and the order of Young's\nmodulus is identical with that of $\\kappa_L$. Calculated results show that\nisotope scattering leads to 5.8\\% reduce of $\\kappa_L$. The size effects on the\n$\\kappa_L$ are also considered, which is usually used in the device\nimplementation. When the characteristic length of MoSSe monolayer is about 110\nnm, the $\\kappa_L$ reduces to half. These results may offer perspectives on\nthermal management of MoSSe monolayer for applications of thermoelectrics,\nthermal circuits and nanoelectronics, and motivate further theoretical or\nexperimental efforts to investigate thermal transports of Janus TMD monolayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 08:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

A\nbug title (summary) and a detailed description is present in most of the bug\ntracking systems. Automatic bug triaging algorithm can be formulated as a\nclassification problem, with the bug title and description as the input,\nmapping it to one of the available developers (classes). The major challenge is\nthat the bug description usually contains a combination of free unstructured\ntext, code snippets, and stack trace making the input data noisy. The existing\nbag-of-words (BOW) feature models do not consider the syntactical and\nsequential word information available in the unstructured text. We propose a\nnovel bug report representation algorithm using an attention based deep\nbidirectional recurrent neural network (DBRNN-A) model that learns a syntactic\nand semantic feature from long word sequences in an unsupervised manner.\nInstead of BOW features, the DBRNN-A based bug representation is then used for\ntraining the classifier. Using an attention mechanism enables the model to\nlearn the context representation over a long word sequence, as in a bug report.\nTo provide a large amount of data to learn the feature learning model, the\nunfixed bug reports (~70% bugs in an open source bug tracking system) are\nleveraged, which were completely ignored in the previous studies. Another\ncontribution is to make this research reproducible by making the source code\navailable and creating a public benchmark dataset of bug reports from three\nopen source bug tracking system: Google Chromium (383,104 bug reports), Mozilla\nCore (314,388 bug reports), and Mozilla Firefox (162,307 bug reports).\nExperimentally we compare our approach with BOW model and machine learning\napproaches and observe that DBRNN-A provides a higher rank-10 average accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 08:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

The\n$^6$Be system is the lightest two-proton ground-state emitter, while $^{16}$Be\nhas been recently proposed to be the first two-neutron ground-state emitter\never observed. A proper understanding of their properties and decay modes\nrequires a reasonable description of the three-body continuum.\n  Purpose: Study the ground-state properties of $^6$Be and $^{16}$Be within a\ngeneral three-body model and investigate their nucleon-nucleon correlations in\nthe continuum.\n  Method: The pseudostate (PS) method in hyperspherical coordinates, using the\nanalytical transformed harmonic oscillator (THO) basis for three-body systems,\nis used to construct the $^6$Be and $^{16}$Be ground-state wave functions.\nThese resonances are approximated as a stable PS around the known two-nucleon\nseparation energy. Effective core-$N$ potentials, constrained by the available\nexperimental information on the binary subsystems $^5$Li and $^{15}$Be, are\nemployed in the calculations.\n  Results: The ground state of $^{16}$Be is found to present a strong dineutron\nconfiguration, with the valence neutrons occupying mostly an $l=2$ state\nrelative to the core. The results are consistent with previous $R$-matrix\ncalculations for the actual continuum. The case of $^6$Be shows a clear\nsymmetry with respect to its mirror partner, the two-neutron halo $^6$He: The\ndiproton configuration is dominant, and the valence protons occupy an $l=1$\norbit.\n  Conclusions: The PS method is found to be a suitable tool in describing the\nproperties of unbound $\\text{core}+N+N$ ground states. For both $^{16}$Be and\n$^6$Be, the results are consistent with previous theoretical studies and\nconfirm the dominant dinucleon configuration.

Given the large variability of household waste, current\nrecycling platforms mostly rely on human operators to analyze the scene,\ntypically composed of many object instances piled up in bulk. Helping them by\nrobotizing the unitary extraction is a key challenge to speed up this tedious\nprocess. Whereas supervised deep learning has proven very efficient for such\nobject-level scene understanding, e.g., generic object detection and\nsegmentation in everyday scenes, it however requires large sets of per-pixel\nlabeled images, that are hardly available for numerous application contexts,\nincluding industrial robotics. We thus propose a step towards a practical\ninteractive application for generating an object-oriented robotic grasp,\nrequiring as inputs only one depth map of the scene and one user click on the\nnext object to extract. More precisely, we address in this paper the middle\nissue of object seg-mentation in top views of piles of bulk objects given a\npixel location, namely seed, provided interactively by a human operator. We\npropose a twofold framework for generating edge-driven instance segments.\nFirst, we repurpose a state-of-the-art fully convolutional object contour\ndetector for seed-based instance segmentation by introducing the notion of\nedge-mask duality with a novel patch-free and contour-oriented loss function.\nSecond, we train one model using only synthetic scenes, instead of manually\nlabeled training data.

However, these\nmethods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity\nand brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter\ntuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such\nmethods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft\nactor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum\nentropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to\nmaximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at\nthe task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on\nthis framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining\noff-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control\nbenchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms,\nour approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across\ndifferent random seeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 09:50:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 21:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

For a working\nfluid consisting of quantum harmonic oscillators, the transition point in\nparameter space where this instability occurs is associated with a\nnon-hermitian degeneracy (exceptional point) of the eigenvalues of the\npropagator. In particular, a third-order exceptional point is observed at the\ntransition from the region where the eigenvalues are complex numbers to the\nregion where all the eigenvalues are real. Within this region we find another\nexceptional point, this time of second order, at which the trajectory becomes\ndivergent. The onset of the divergent behavior corresponds to the modulus of\none of the eigenvalues becoming larger than one. The physical origin of this\nphenomenon is that the hot and cold heat baths are unable to dissipate the\nfrictional internal heat generated in the adiabatic strokes of the cycle. This\nbehavior is contrasted with that of quantum spins as working fluid which have a\ncompact Hamiltonian and thus no exceptional points.

It is found that\nthe main parameter is the difference between the substrate temperature and\n$T_m$, pointing to a local mechanism for arrest near the contact line.\nUnexpectedly, the spreading is also found to stop below the gelation\ntemparature, which we attribute to a local enhancement in polymer concentration\ndue to evaporation near the contact line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 12:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

These configurations depend on the PNS\nthermodynamic profiles, whose evolution largely depends upon the neutrino\ndiffusion. We developed a new PNS evolutionary code that solves by iteration\nthe neutrino number and energy transport equations together with the\nrelativistic stellar structure equations assuming spherical symmetry. The\nneutrino cross sections are determined consistently with the underlying\nequation of state (EoS). To include the EoSs in the evolution, we devised and\ntested a new fitting formula for the interacting part of the baryon\nfree-energy, valid at finite temperature and arbitrary degeneracy. Using our\ncode, we provide estimates for the neutrino signal in the Super-Kamiokande III\ndetector and the frequencies of the gravitational waves due to stellar\noscillations, for three stellar masses and three nucleonic EoSs. For the first\ntime we evolve a PNS with a nuclear many-body theory EoS in a consistent way,\nthat is, we take into account realistic nuclear interactions in the computation\nof the neutrino cross sections. By including rotation in an effective way, we\nhave also determined the time variation of the rotation frequency due to PNS\ncontraction and neutrino angular momentum loss, and the gravitational wave\nsignal due to rotation. We find that the mass shedding limit restricts the\ninitial angular momentum. Consequently, the final rotation frequency has to be\nsmaller than about 300 Hz for a PNS of about 1.6 solar masses whose EoS is\ndescribed by the GM3 mean-field model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 13:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

In order to solve this optimization problem, we propose a\nmethod, which is based on the spectral properties of a novel node-weighted\nLaplacian operator. The proposed method is applicable to large-scale networks\nwith millions of nodes. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and\nopens new directions in understanding the vulnerability and robustness of\ncomplex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 14:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

In\nseveral areas, the spiking response (to a repeated stimulus) has shown a higher\ndegree of regularity than predicted by a Poisson process. However, a simple\nmodel to explain this low variability is still lacking. Here we introduce a new\nmodel, with a correction to Poisson statistics, which can accurately predict\nthe regularity of neural spike trains in response to a repeated stimulus. The\nmodel has only two parameters, but can reproduce the observed variability in\nretinal recordings in various conditions. We show analytically why this\napproximation can work. In a model of the spike emitting process where a\nrefractory period is assumed, we derive that our simple correction can well\napproximate the spike train statistics over a broad range of firing rates. Our\nmodel can be easily plugged to stimulus processing models, like\nLinear-nonlinear model or its generalizations, to replace the Poisson spike\ntrain hypothesis that is commonly assumed. It estimates the amount of\ninformation transmitted much more accurately than Poisson models in retinal\nrecordings.

First, since the best-fit spectral model\nfor the main pulse of GRB 170817A is a cutoff power law with a hard low-energy\nphoton index ($\\alpha =-0.62_{-0.54}^{+0.49} $), we consider an off-axis\nphotosphere model.

Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to derive\naccurate cosmological distances through empirical standardization techniques.\nDespite this success neither the progenitors of SNe Ia nor the explosion\nprocess are fully understood. The U-band region has been less well observed for\nnearby SNe, due to technical challenges, but is the most readily accessible\nband for high-redshift SNe.\n  Aims. Using spectrophotometry from the Nearby Supernova Factory, we study the\norigin and extent of U-band spectroscopic variations in SNe Ia and explore\nconsequences for their standardization and the potential for providing new\ninsights into the explosion process.\n  Methods. We divide the U-band spectrum into four wavelength regions\n{\\lambda}(uNi), {\\lambda}(uTi), {\\lambda}(uSi) and {\\lambda}(uCa).

(1) The flux of the uTi feature is an extremely sensitive\ntemperature/luminosity indicator, standardizing the SN peak luminosity to 0.116\n$\\pm$ 0.011 mag RMS.

The aim of this chapter is to\n(1) describe the principle operation of PCF based gas/ chemical sensors, (2)\ndiscuss the important PCF properties for optical sensors, (3) extensively\ndiscuss the different types of microstructured optical fiber based gas/\nchemical sensors, (4) study the effects of different core-cladding shapes, and\nfiber background materials on sensing performance, and (5) highlight the main\nchallenges of PCF based gas/ chemical sensors and possible solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 22:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

In\nmost cases they involve a negative slope, linear process that presents an\nadiabatic point where the process is tangent to an adiabatic curve and $\\delta\nQ=0$, signalling that the flow of heat is reversed. We introduce a parabolic\nprocess, still simple enough to be fully explored analitically in order to deal\nwith the usual follow up question on the possibility of having more than one\nadiabatic point. Having one (linear), two (parabolic) or more such points allow\nthe construction of reversible, non-isoentropic processes, that we call\npseudoadiabatics, whose total heat exchanged is zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 09:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}
