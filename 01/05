Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those\nlargely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He, are thought to be unable to\nform habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the young system is\nsubjected to close stellar passages while it resides in its stellar birth\ncluster. Various potential hazards remain after clusters disperse. For\ninstance, central galactic regions may present risks to habitability via nearby\nsupernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In addition,\nplanets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the\nGalaxy, as local gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the\nbinary's eccentricity until it destabilizes the planets it hosts. Here we\nreview the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary\nhabitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky\nplanets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars\nwith a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star\nclusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely\nlong-lived clusters. Regarding threats to habitability from supernovae, GRBs,\nand comet showers, many recent studies suggest that their hazards are more\nlimited than originally thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy enhance\nthe threat that very wide binary companions pose to planetary habitability, but\nthe probability that a very wide binary star disrupts habitability will always\nbe substantially below 100% for any environment. While some Milky Way regions\nmust be more hospitable to habitable planets than others, it is difficult to\nstate that habitable planets are confined to any well-defined region of the\nGalaxy or that any other particular region of the Galaxy is uninhabitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 18:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

It has been predicted\nthat star spots induce non-zero intrinsic linear polarization by breaking the\nvisible stellar disk symmetry. Although small, this effect might be useful for\nstar spot studies, and it is particularly significant for a future polarimetric\natmosphere characterization of exoplanets orbiting active host stars. Using\nmodels for a center-to-limb variation of the intensity and polarization in\npresence of continuum scattering and adopting a simplified two-temperature\nphotosphere model, we aim to estimate the intrinsic linear polarization for\nlate-type stars of different gravity, effective temperature, and spottedness.\nWe developed a code that simulates various spot configurations or uses\narbitrary surface maps, performs numerical disk integration, and builds Stokes\nparameter phase curves for a star over a rotation period for a selected\nwavelength. It allows estimating minimum and maximum polarization values for a\ngiven set of stellar parameters and spot coverages. Based on assumptions about\nphotosphere-to-spot temperature contrasts and spot size distributions, we\ncalculate the linear polarization for late-type stars with $T_{\\rm eff}$ = 3500\nK - 6000 K, log$g$ = 1.0 - 5.0, using the plane-parallel and spherical\natmosphere models. Employing random spot surface distribution, we analyze the\nrelation between spot coverage and polarization and determine the influence of\ndifferent input parameters on results. Furthermore, we consider spot\nconfigurations with polar spots and active latitudes and longitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 18:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

We also describe the gas and the mass distributions in the\nfield through a lensing and an X-ray analysis. This is the first of a series of\nworks which will analyze these type of systems to characterize them. Both\nmerging clusters candidates do not show evidence of having had a recent merger\nevent.

Are all filaments bundles of fibers? To address this question, we\nhave investigated the gas organization within the paradigmatic Integral Shape\nFilament (ISF). We combined two new ALMA Cycle 3 mosaics with previous IRAM 30m\nobservations to produce a high-dynamic range N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) emission map of\nthe ISF tracing its high-density material and velocity structure down to scales\nof 0.009 pc. From the analysis of the gas kinematics, we identify a total of 55\ndense fibers in the central region of the ISF. Independently of their location,\nthese fibers are characterized by transonic internal motions, lengths of ~0.15\npc, and masses per-unit-length close to those expected in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. The ISF fibers are spatially organized forming a dense bundle with\nmultiple hub-like associations likely shaped by the local gravitational\npotential. Within this complex network, the ISF fibers show a compact radial\nemission profile with a median FWHM of 0.035 pc systematically narrower than\nthe previously proposed universal 0.1 pc filament width. Our ALMA observations\nreveal complex bundles of fibers in the ISF, suggesting strong similarities\nbetween the internal substructure of this massive filament and previously\nstudied lower-mass objects. The fibers show identical dynamic properties in\nboth low- and high-mass regions, and their widespread detection suggests a\npreferred organizational mechanism of gas in which the physical fiber\ndimensions (width and length) are self-regulated depending on their intrinsic\ngas density. Combined with previous works, we identify a systematic increase of\nthe surface density of fibers as a function of the total mass per-unit-length\nin filamentary clouds. Based on this empirical correlation, we propose a\nunified star-formation scenario where the observed differences between low- and\nhigh-mass clouds emerge naturally from the initial concentration of fibers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

Recent studies focus\non the highly optically-thick limit relevant to the densest ultra-luminous\ngalaxies and super star clusters, where reprocessed infrared photons provide\nthe dominant source of electromagnetic momentum. However, even among starburst\ngalaxies, the great majority instead lie in the so-called \"single-scattering\"\nlimit, where the system is optically-thick to the incident starlight, but\noptically-thin to the re-radiated infrared. In this paper we present a\nstability analysis and multidimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations\nexploring the stability and dynamics of isothermal dusty gas columns in this\nregime. We describe our algorithm for full angle-dependent radiation transport\nbased on the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. For a range of\nnear-Eddington fluxes, we show that the medium is unstable, producing\nconvective-like motions in a turbulent atmosphere with a scale height\nsignificantly inflated compared to the gas pressure scale height and\nmass-weighted turbulent energy densities of $\\sim 0.01-0.1$ of the midplane\nradiation energy density, corresponding to mass-weighted velocity dispersions\nof Mach number $\\sim 0.5-2$. Extrapolation of our results to optical depths of\n$10^3$ implies maximum turbulent Mach numbers of $\\sim20$. Comparing our\nresults to galaxy-averaged observations, and subject to the approximations of\nour calculations, we find that radiation pressure does not contribute\nsignificantly to the effective supersonic pressure support in star-forming\ndisks, which in general are substantially sub-Eddington. We further examine the\ntime-averaged vertical density profiles in dynamical equilibrium and comment on\nimplications for radiation-pressure-driven galactic winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 19:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Finally, to validate\nthis study, we compare the accident-related tweets with both the traffic\naccident log on freeways and traffic data on local roads from 15,000 loop\ndetectors. It is found that nearly 66% of the accident-related tweets can be\nlocated by the accident log and more than 80% of them can be tied to nearby\nabnormal traffic data. Several important issues of using Twitter to detect\ntraffic accidents have been brought up by the comparison including the location\nand time bias, as well as the characteristics of influential users and\nhashtags.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 19:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

The pressure formulation has not been used in\nnumerical studies. The goal of this work is to study its use in the adaptive\nfinite element solution of the porous medium equation.

However, current island model has some drawbacks. One is\nthat after a certain number of generations, different islands may retain quite\nsimilar, converged sub-populations thereby losing diversity and decreasing\nefficiency. Another drawback is that determining the number of islands to\nmaintain is also very challenging. Meanwhile initializing many sub-populations\nincreases the randomness of island model.

While much progress has been\ntheoretically and experimentally made in 2D, the understanding on SF in 3D is\nfar from complete. A long-standing challenge is to understand SF on looplike\ntopological excitations which are spatially extended objects. In this work, we\nconstruct a powerful topological-field-theoretical framework approach for 3D\ntopological orders, which leads to a systematic characterization and\nclassification of SF. For systems with Abelian gauge groups ($G_g$) and Abelian\nsymmetry groups ($G_s$), we successfully establish equivalence classes that\nlead to a finite number of patterns of SF, although there are notoriously\ninfinite number of Lagrangian-descriptions of the system. We compute\ntopologically distinct types of fractional symmetry charges carried by\nparticles. Then, for each type, we compute topologically distinct statistical\nphases of braiding processes among loop excitations and external symmetry\nfluxes. As a result, we are able to unambiguously list all physical observables\nfor each pattern of SF. We present detailed calculations on many concrete\nexamples. As an example, we find that the SF in an untwisted\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry is classified by $ (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^6\\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2\\oplus\n(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2\\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$.

The elastic\npotential energy involves a new elastobaric coefficient that is proportional to\nthe product of two factors: one factor depends on universal constants and the\nother on the incident neutron wave vector per degree of freedom. The ELM was\ntested for dry protein samples with an elastobaric coefficient corresponding to\n3 degrees of freedom.

We find that two\nkinds of quasiparticles can be excited, while both of them are superpositions\nof particle and hole states in the Fermi sea.

This, however, makes the latter appealing for balloon and\nspace observations from above (most of) the Earth's atmosphere. We estimate the\nresidual effect of the O$_2$ band on the K I $D_2$ line at altitudes typical\nfor stratospheric balloons. Our aim is to study the feasibility of observing\nthe 770 nm window. Specifically, this paper serves as a preparation for the\nthird flight of the Sunrise balloon-borne observatory. The results indicate\nthat the absorption by O$_2$ is still present, albeit much weaker, at the\nexpected balloon altitude. We applied the obtained O$_2$ transmittance to K I\n$D_2$ synthetic polarimetric spectra and found that in the absence of\nline-of-sight motions, the residual O$_2$ has a negligible effect on the K I\n$D_2$ line. On the other hand, for Doppler-shifted K I $D_2$ data, the residual\nO$_2$ might alter the shape of the Stokes profiles. However, the residual O$_2$\nabsorption is sufficiently weak at stratospheric levels that it can be divided\nout if appropriate measurements are made, something that is impossible at\nground level. Therefore, for the first time with Sunrise III, we will be able\nto perform polarimetric observations of the K I $D_2$ line and, consequently,\nwe will have improved access to the thermodynamics and magnetic properties of\nthe upper photosphere from observations of the K I lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 07:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

Due to the operation of the iSWAP\ngate one of the dots acts as a feedback controller which blocks the transport\nwith the bias in the other dot, thus inducing the electron pumping against the\nbias; this leads to the locally negative entropy production. Operation of the\ndemon is associated with the information transfer between the dots, which is\nstudied quantitatively by mapping the analyzed setup onto the thermodynamically\nequivalent auxiliary system.

We define a production and consumption measure for\nsocial-media users, which captures the political leaning of the content shared\nand received by them. By comparing the two, we find that Twitter users are, to\na large degree, exposed to political opinions that agree with their own.

Nevertheless, we have recently shown that for resonantly\nexcited two-level systems, emission of a photon during the presence of the\nexcitation laser pulse and subsequent re-excitation results in a degradation of\nthe obtainable single-photon purity. Here, we demonstrate that generating\nsingle photons from self-assembled quantum dots with a scheme based on\ntwo-photon excitation of the biexciton strongly suppresses the re-excitation.\nSpecifically, the pulse-length dependence of the multi-photon error rate\nreveals a quadratic dependence in contrast to the linear dependence of\nresonantly excited two-level systems, improving the obtainable multi-photon\nerror rate by several orders of magnitude for short pulses.

However, existing solutions to this problem rely on human experts to\ndefine features and often miss many vulnerabilities (i.e., incurring high false\nnegative rate). In this paper, we initiate the study of using deep\nlearning-based vulnerability detection to relieve human experts from the\ntedious and subjective task of manually defining features. Since deep learning\nis motivated to deal with problems that are very different from the problem of\nvulnerability detection, we need some guiding principles for applying deep\nlearning to vulnerability detection. In particular, we need to find\nrepresentations of software programs that are suitable for deep learning. For\nthis purpose, we propose using code gadgets to represent programs and then\ntransform them into vectors, where a code gadget is a number of (not\nnecessarily consecutive) lines of code that are semantically related to each\nother. This leads to the design and implementation of a deep learning-based\nvulnerability detection system, called Vulnerability Deep Pecker\n(VulDeePecker). In order to evaluate VulDeePecker, we present the first\nvulnerability dataset for deep learning approaches. Experimental results show\nthat VulDeePecker can achieve much fewer false negatives (with reasonable false\npositives) than other approaches. We further apply VulDeePecker to 3 software\nproducts (namely Xen, Seamonkey, and Libav) and detect 4 vulnerabilities, which\nare not reported in the National Vulnerability Database but were \"silently\"\npatched by the vendors when releasing later versions of these products; in\ncontrast, these vulnerabilities are almost entirely missed by the other\nvulnerability detection systems we experimented with.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 09:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

For example, seasonality is often\naccounted for in statistical models because climatic oscillations occurring\nevery year have an obvious impact on river flow. Further sources of alteration\ncould be caused by changes in reservoir management, instrumentation or even\nunexpected shifts in climatic conditions. When these changes are ignored the\nstatistical results can be strongly misleading. This paper develops an\nautomatic procedure to estimate number and locations of changepoints in\nPeriodic AutoRegressive models. These latter have been extensively used for\nmodelling seasonality in hydrology, climatology, economics and electrical\nengineering, but there are very few papers devoted also to changepoints\ndetection, moreover being limited to changes in mean or variance. In our\nproposal we allow the model structure as a whole to change, and estimation is\nperformed by optimizing an objective function derived from the Information\nCriterion using Genetic Algorithms. The proposed methodology is brought out\nthrough the example of three river flows, for which we built models with\npossible changepoints and evaluated their forecasting accuracy by means of Root\nMean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The\nlast years of data sets have been omitted from the selection and estimation\nprocedure and were then used to forecast.

QKD is a cutting-edge\nsecurity technology that provides mathematically proven security by using\nquantum physical effects and information theoretical axioms to generate a\nguaranteed non-disclosed stream of encryption keys. Although it has been a\nfield of theoretical research for some time, it has only been producing\nmarket-ready solutions for a short period of time. The downside of this\ntechnology is that its key generation rate is only around 52,000 key bits per\nsecond over a distance of 50 km. As this rate limits the data throughput to the\nsame rate, it is substandard for normal modern communications, especially for\nsecurely interconnecting networks. IPsec, on the other hand, is a well-known\nsecurity protocol that uses classical encryption and is capable of exactly\ncreating site-to-site virtual private networks. This paper presents a solution\nthat combines the performance advantages of IPsec with QKD. The combination\nsacrifices only a small portion of QKD security by using the generated keys a\nlimited number of times instead of just once. As a part of this, the solution\nanswers the question of how many data bits per key bit make sensible upper and\nlower boundaries to yield high performance while maintaining high security.\nWhile previous approaches complement the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE),\nthis approach simplifies the implementation with a new key synchronization\nconcept, proposing a lightweight protocol that uses relatively few, slim\ncontrol messages and sparse acknowledgement. Furthermore, it provides a\nLinux-based module for the AIT QKD software using the Netlink XFRM Application\nProgrammers Interface to feed the quantum key to the IP***ABSTRACT TRUNCATED TO\n1920 CHARS***\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 11:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

Our approach leverages the fact that the spectral structure of\nmatrix representations of a graph encodes global information about community\nstructure. The Spectral Graph Forge uses a low-rank approximation of the\nmodularity matrix to generate synthetic graphs that match a target modularity\nwithin user-selectable degree of accuracy, while allowing other aspects of\nstructure to vary.

Moreover, the perception performance often drops significantly\nfor new scenarios, due to the poor generalization capability of models trained\non limited and biased annotations. In this work, we resort to transfer\nknowledge from automatically rendered scene annotations in virtual-world to\nfacilitate real-world visual tasks. Although virtual-world annotations can be\nideally diverse and unlimited, the discrepant data distributions between\nvirtual and real-world make it challenging for knowledge transferring. We thus\npropose a novel Semantic-aware Grad-GAN (SG-GAN) to perform virtual-to-real\ndomain adaption with the ability of retaining vital semantic information.\nBeyond the simple holistic color/texture transformation achieved by prior\nworks, SG-GAN successfully personalizes the appearance adaption for each\nsemantic region in order to preserve their key characteristic for better\nrecognition. It presents two main contributions to traditional GANs: 1) a soft\ngradient-sensitive objective for keeping semantic boundaries; 2) a\nsemantic-aware discriminator for validating the fidelity of personalized\nadaptions with respect to each semantic region. Qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our SG-GAN in scene adaption over\nstate-of-the-art GANs.

Evaluating pairwise comparisons breaks\ndown such complex decision problems into tractable ones. Pairwise comparison\nmatrices (PCMs) are regularly used to solve multiple-criteria decision-making\n(MCDM) problems, for example, using Saaty's analytic hierarchy process (AHP)\nframework. However, there are two significant drawbacks of using PCMs. First,\nhumans evaluate PCMs in an inconsistent manner. Second, not all entries of a\nlarge PCM can be reliably filled by human decision makers. We address these two\nissues by first establishing a novel connection between PCMs and\ntime-irreversible Markov processes. Specifically, we show that every PCM\ninduces a family of dissipative maximum path entropy random walks (MERW) over\nthe set of alternatives. We show that only `consistent' PCMs correspond to\ndetailed balanced MERWs. We identify the non-equilibrium entropy production in\nthe induced MERWs as a metric of inconsistency of the underlying PCMs. Notably,\nthe entropy production satisfies all of the recently laid out criteria for\nreasonable consistency indices.

To improve the statistical\nproperties of such data, or to allow parametric testing, logarithmic or logit\ntransformations are often used. Box-Cox transformations or ad hoc methods are\nsometimes used for parameters for which no transformation is known to\napproximate normality. However, these methods do not always give good agreement\nwith the Gaussian. A transformation is discussed that maps probability\ndistributions as closely as possible to the normal distribution, with exact\nagreement for continuous distributions. To illustrate, the transformation is\napplied to a theoretical distribution, and to quantitative\nelectroencephalographic (qEEG) measures from repeat recordings of 32 subjects\nwhich are highly non-normal. Agreement with the Gaussian was better than using\nlogarithmic, logit, or Box-Cox transformations. Since normal data have\npreviously been shown to have better test-retest reliability than non-normal\ndata under fairly general circumstances, the implications of our transformation\nfor the test-retest reliability of parameters were investigated. Reliability\nwas shown to improve with the transformation, where the improvement was\ncomparable to that using Box-Cox. An advantage of the general transformation is\nthat it does not require laborious optimization over a range of parameters or a\ncase-specific choice of form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 13:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-08"}

In the dual, realizable order types and abstract order types are\ncombinatorial analogues of line arrangements and pseudoline arrangements.

We study the associated admission control problem of finding the user\nselection that minimizes $PoF$ subject to selective fairness, and show that\nthis combinatorial problem can be solved efficiently if the feasibility set\nsatisfies a condition; in our model it suffices that the wireless channels are\nstochastically dominated.

Systems with flat energy bands have been\nsuggested to cure the problem and provide a route to room-temperature\nsuperconductivity, but previous studies are limited to only BCS models with an\neffective attractive interaction. Here we generalize Eliashberg's theory of\nstrong-coupling superconductivity to systems with flat bands and relate the\nmean-field critical temperature to the microscopic parameters describing\nelectron-phonon and electron-electron interaction. We also analyze the\nstrong-coupling corrections to the BCS results, and construct the phase diagram\nexhibiting superconductivity and magnetic phases on an equal footing. Our\nresults are especially relevant for novel quantum materials where electronic\ndispersion and interaction strength are controllable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 15:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 13:10:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 11:56:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 12:31:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 12:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

Emphasis has been put here first to\nshow what types of nonlinear interactions do exist, and what physical\ninterpretations follow each. The standard quadratic interactions between light\nand mechanical motion is expressed as the product of cavity light intensity and\nsquared mirror position. However, there exists a non-standard quadratic\noptomechanical interaction as well, which assumes a mathematically different\nform and appears as the squared product of field and mirror momenta. This\nnon-standard type of quadratic interaction originates from two corrections: the\nmomentum exchange and conservation among mirror and field, as well as\nrelativistic corrections due to different mechanisms. Both these types of\nnon-standard interactions become relevant when the ratio of mechanical to\noptical frequency is no longer negligible. Next, we turn to the solution\ntechnique of such interactions, and introduce a formal higher-order operator\nmethod to tackle the nonlinear evolution of quantum systems. This enables one\nto accurately study any type of quantum nonlinear interaction using the\nanalysis tools of linear algebra. In order to employ the analytical power of\nhigher-order operator method, one first needs to identify a closed Lie algebra,\nwhich should satisfy closedness property under commutation either exactly or\napproximately, and is referred to as the basis. Having the basis of\nhigher-order operators known, one may proceed to construct the corresponding\nLangevin equations, which can be now conveniently analyzed using the existing\nmathematical toolbox of linear algebra to yield the spectral densities,\nmoments, and expectation values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 15:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 12:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

One of the LSTM NNs, called a discriminative network,\naims to maximize the probability of assigning correct labels to both true\ntraffic state matrices (i.e., traffic flow and traffic density within a given\nspatial-temporal area) and the traffic state matrices generated from the other\nneural network.

We\nindependently train liver and tumor segmentation models and cascade them for a\ncombined segmentation of the liver and its tumor. The first stage involves\nsegmentation of liver and the second stage uses the first stage's segmentation\nresults for localization of liver and henceforth tumor segmentations inside\nliver region. The liver model was trained on the down-sampled axial slices\n$(256 \\times 256)$, whereas for the tumor model no down-sampling of slices was\ndone, but instead it was trained on the CT axial slices windowed at three\ndifferent Hounsfield (HU) levels. On the test set our model achieved a global\ndice score of 0.923 and 0.625 on liver and tumor respectively. The computed\ntumor burden had an rmse of 0.044.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 12:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

Specifically, we\nhypothesize that the use of pixel coordinates will lead to (a) Resolution\ninvariant performance. Here, by resolution we mean the spacing between the\npixels rather than the size of the image matrix. (b) Overall improvement in\nclassification accuracy in comparison with network models trained without local\npixel coordinates. This is due to position coordinates enabling the network to\nlearn relationship between parts of objects, mimicking the human vision system.\nWe demonstrate our hypothesis using empirical results and intuitive\nexplanations of the feature maps learnt by deep neural networks. Specifically,\nour approach showed improvements in MNIST digit classification and beats state\nof the results on the SVHN database. We also show that the performance of our\nnetworks is unaffected despite training the same using blurred images of the\nMNIST database and predicting on the high resolution database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 12:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

Among these approaches,\ncomment generation for source code is gaining more and more attention and has\nbecome a popular research area.

The theory of coalgebras is used to frame type spaces\nand to account for the existence of some of them.
