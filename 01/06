The present authors argued that this is as a result\nof a competition between the destabilizing effect of gravity and the\nstabilizing effect of the rotation. In the present paper we consider the\nextreme limit of high rotation rates in which rotational forces dominate and\ngravitational forces may be ignored. The two liquid layers initially form\nconcentric cylinders, centred on the axis of rotation. The configuration may be\nthought of as a fluid-fluid centrifuge. There are two types of perturbation to\nthe interface that may be considered, an azimuthal perturbation around the\ncircumference of the interface and a varicose perturbation in the axial\ndirection along the length of the interface. It is the first of these types of\nperturbation that we consider here, and so the flow may be considered\nessentially two-dimensional, taking place in a circular domain.\n  We carry out a linear stability analysis on a perturbation to the hydrostatic\nbackground state and derive a fourth order Orr-Sommerfeld-like equation that\ngoverns the system. We consider the dynamics of systems of stable and unstable\nconfigurations, inviscid and viscous fluids, immiscible fluid layers with\nsurface tension, and miscible fluid layers that may have some initial diffusion\nof density. Theoretical predictions are compared with numerical experiments and\nthe agreement is shown to be good. We do not restrict our analysis to equal\nvolume fluid layers and so our results also have applications in coating and\nlubrication problems in rapidly rotating systems and machinery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 16:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

This study describes the dynamics of a\nphysiologically based mean-field model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical\nsystem, and shows how it accounts for key electrophysiological correlates of\nPD. Its connectivity comprises partially segregated direct and indirect\npathways through the striatum, a hyperdirect pathway involving a\ncorticosubthalamic projection, thalamostriatal feedback, and local inhibition\nin striatum and external pallidum (GPe). In a companion paper, realistic\nsteady-state firing rates were obtained for the healthy state, and after\ndopamine loss modeled by weaker direct and stronger indirect pathways, reduced\nintrapallidal inhibition, lower firing thresholds of the GPe and subthalamic\nnucleus (STN), a stronger striato-GPe projection, and weaker cortical\ninteractions. Here we show that oscillations around 5 and 20 Hz can arise with\na strong indirect pathway, which also increases synchrony throughout the basal\nganglia. Further, increased theta power with nigrostriatal degeneration\ncorrelates with reduced alpha power and peak frequency, matching experiments.\nUnlike the hyperdirect pathway, the indirect pathway sustains oscillations with\nrealistic phase relationships. Changes in basal ganglia responses to transient\nstimuli accord with experimental data. Reduced cortical gains due to both\nnigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine loss lead to slower cortical activity\nchanges and may be related to bradykinesia. Finally, increased EEG power found\nin some studies may be partly explained by a lower effective GPe firing\nthreshold, reduced GPe-GPe inhibition, and/or weaker intracortical connections\nin PD.

These rate changes have\nbeen explained qualitatively in terms of the direct/indirect pathway model,\ninvolving projections of distinct striatal populations to the output nuclei and\nGPe. Although these populations partly overlap, evidence suggests dopamine\ndepletion differentially affects cortico-striato-pallidal connection strengths\nto the two pallidal segments. Dopamine loss may also decrease the striatal\nsignal-to-noise ratio, reducing both corticostriatal coupling and striatal\nfiring thresholds.

Potentially, such breakdown could\narise from several possible factors, including dependence on dimensionless\nnumbers other that $Re$ or velocity coupling to other fields such as\ntemperature. However, careful redesign and calibration of the experiment showed\nthat this unexpected result was due to background errorscaused by minute\nmisalignments which lead to a noisy and irreproducible torque signal at low\nrotation speeds and prevented correct background subtraction normally ascribed\nto frictional losses. An important lesson to be learnt is that multiple minute\nmisalignments can nonlinearly couple to the torque signal and provide a dc\noffset that cannot be removed by averaging. That offset can cause the observed\ndivergence of the friction coefficient C_f from its constant value observed in\nthe turbulent regime.

The\nstudy exploits a large sample of new quasars from the first two years of\nobservations by the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS).\nThe CIV forest is a weaker tracer of large-scale structure than the Ly$\\alpha$\nforest, but benefits from being accessible at redshifts $z<2$ where the quasar\nnumber density from eBOSS is high. Our data sample consists of 287,651 CIV\nforest quasars in the redshift range $1.4<z<3.5$ and 387,315 tracer quasars\nwith $1.2<z<3.5$. We measure large-scale correlations from CIV absorption\noccuring in three distinct quasar rest-frame wavelength bands of the spectra\nreferred to as the CIV forest, the SiIV forest and the Ly$\\alpha$ forest. From\nthe combined fit to the quasar-CIV cross-correlations for the CIV forest and\nthe SiIV forest, the CIV redshift-space distortion parameter is $\\beta_{\\rm\nCIV}=0.27_{\\ -0.14}^{\\ +0.16}$ and its combination with the CIV linear\ntransmission bias parameter is $b_{\\rm CIV}(1+\\beta_{\\rm CIV})=-0.0183_{\\\n-0.0014}^{\\ +0.0013}$ ($1\\sigma$ statistical error) at the mean redshift\n$z=2.00$. Splitting the sample at $z=2.2$ to constrain the bias evolution with\nredshift yields the power-law exponent $\\gamma=0.60\\pm0.63$, indicating a\nsignificantly weaker redshift-evolution than for the Ly$\\alpha$ forest linear\ntransmission bias. We demonstrate that CIV absorption has the potential to be\nused as a probe of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). While the current data\nset is insufficient for a detection of the BAO peak feature, the final quasar\nsamples for redshifts $1.4<z<2.2$ from eBOSS and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI) are expected to provide measurements of the isotropic BAO\nscale to $\\sim7\\%$ and $\\sim3\\%$ precision, respectively, at $z\\simeq1.6$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 17:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 15:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Randomly shuffling the\ndata-set among a cluster of workers allows different nodes to obtain fresh data\nassignments at each learning epoch.

However, the statistical benefits of\ndistributed data shuffling come at the cost of extra communication overhead\nfrom the master node to worker nodes, and can act as one of the major\nbottlenecks in the overall time for computation. There has been significant\nrecent interest in devising approaches to minimize this communication overhead.\nOne approach is to provision for extra storage at the computing nodes. The\nother emerging approach is to leverage coded communication to minimize the\noverall communication overhead.\n  The focus of this work is to understand the fundamental trade-off between the\namount of storage and the communication overhead for distributed data\nshuffling. In this work, we first present an information theoretic formulation\nfor the data shuffling problem, accounting for the underlying problem\nparameters (number of workers, $K$, number of data points, $N$, and the\navailable storage, $S$ per node).

Our type system extends recent work on\nautomatic amortized resource analysis (AARA), a set of techniques that\nautomatically derive provable upper bounds on the resource consumption of\nprograms. We devise new techniques that build on the potential method to\nachieve compositionality, precision, and automation.\n  A strict global requirement that a program always maintains constant resource\nusage is too restrictive for most practical applications. It is sufficient to\nrequire that the program's resource behavior remain constant with respect to an\nattacker who is only allowed to observe part of the program's state and\nbehavior. To account for this, our type system incorporates information flow\ntracking into its resource analysis. This allows our system to certify programs\nthat need to violate the constant-time requirement in certain cases, as long as\ndoing so does not leak confidential information to attackers. We formalize this\nguarantee by defining a new notion of resource-aware noninterference, and prove\nthat our system enforces it.\n  Finally, we show how our type inference algorithm can be used to synthesize a\nconstant-time implementation from one that cannot be verified as secure,\neffectively repairing insecure programs automatically. We also show how a\nsecond novel AARA system that computes lower bounds on resource usage can be\nused to derive quantitative bounds on the amount of information that a program\nleaks through its resource use.

This is perhaps most strikingly demonstrated by a result,\ndue to Mathias, to the effect that adding the axiom of constructibility to KPP\ngives rise to a much stronger theory, whereas in the case of KP the\nconstructible hierarchy provides an inner model, so that KP and KP+V=L have the\nsame strength. This paper will be concerned with the relationship between KPP\nand KPP plus the axiom of choice or even the global axiom of choice, GAC. Since\nL is the standard vehicle to furnish a model in which this axiom holds, the\nusual argument for demonstrating that the addition of AC or GAC to KPP does not\nincrease proof-theoretic strength does not apply in any obvious way. Among\nother tools, the paper uses techniques from ordinal analysis to show that\nKPP+GAC has the same strength as KPP, thereby answering a question of Mathias.\nMoreover, it is shown that KPP+GAC is conservative over KPP for Pi-1-4\nstatements of analysis. The method of ordinal analysis for theories with power\nset was developed in an earlier paper. The technique allows one to compute\nwitnessing information from infinitary proofs, providing bounds for the\ntransfinite iterations of the power set operation that are provable in a\ntheory. As the theory KPP+GAC provides a very useful tool for defining models\nand realizability models of other theories that are hard to construct without\naccess to a uniform selection mechanism, it is desirable to determine its exact\nproof-theoretic strength.

An\nautomated and flexible data processing framework, which we term the Data\nCruncher, combines multiple data reduction pipelines together to process all\nspectroscopic, polarimetric, and calibration data taken with GPIES. With no\nhuman intervention, fully reduced and calibrated data products are available\nless than an hour after the data are taken to expedite follow-up on potential\nobjects of interest. The Data Cruncher can run on a supercomputer to reprocess\nall GPIES data in a single day as improvements are made to our data reduction\npipelines. A backend MySQL database indexes all files, which are synced to the\ncloud, and a front-end web server allows for easy browsing of all files\nassociated with GPIES. To help observers, quicklook displays show reduced data\nas they are processed in real-time, and chatbots on Slack post observing\ninformation as well as reduced data products. Together, the GPIES automated\ndata processing architecture reduces our workload, provides real-time data\nreduction, optimizes our observing strategy, and maintains a homogeneously\nreduced dataset to study planet occurrence and instrument performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 19:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

We introduce a new\nnotion of mixing of a random walk on a (undirected) graph, called local mixing.\nInformally, the local mixing with respect to a given node $s$, is the mixing of\na random walk probability distribution restricted to a large enough subset of\nnodes --- say, a subset of size at least $n/\\beta$ for a given parameter\n$\\beta$ --- containing $s$. The time to mix over such a subset by a random walk\nstarting from a source node $s$ is called the local mixing time with respect to\n$s$. The local mixing time captures the local connectivity and expansion\nproperties around a given source node and is a useful parameter that determines\nthe running time of algorithms for partial information spreading, gossip etc.\n  Our first contribution is formally defining the notion of local mixing time\nin an undirected graph. We then present an efficient distributed algorithm\nwhich computes a constant factor approximation to the local mixing time with\nrespect to a source node $s$ in $\\tilde{O}(\\tau_s)$ rounds, where $\\tau_s$ is\nthe local mixing time w.r.t $s$ in an $n$-node regular graph. This bound holds\nwhen $\\tau_s$ is significantly smaller than the conductance of the local mixing\nset (i.e., the set where the walk mixes locally); this is typically the\ninteresting case where the local mixing time is significantly smaller than the\nmixing time (with respect to $s$). We also present a distributed algorithm that\ncomputes the exact local mixing time in $\\tilde{O}(\\tau_s \\mathcal{D})$ rounds,\nwhere $\\mathcal{D} =\\min\\{\\tau_s, D\\}$ and $D$ is the diameter of the graph. We\nfurther show that local mixing time tightly characterizes the complexity of\npartial information spreading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 19:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

Their normalized radial mass growth histories (MGHs) are\nnearly close among them but with periods of outside-in assembly during or after\nthe mergers. For all the simulations, the archaeological radial MGHs calculated\nfrom the $z = 0$ stellar-particles age distribution are similar to the current\nMGHs, which evidences that the mass assembly by ex-situ stars and the radial\nmass transport do not change significantly their radial mass distributions. Our\nresults agree qualitatively with observational inferences from the fossil\nrecord method applied to a survey of local galaxies and from look-back\nobservations of progenitors of MW-sized galaxies. However, the inside-out\ngrowth mode is more pronounced and the $R_{0.5}$ growth is faster in\nsimulations than in observational inferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 21:19:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 22:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

The accretion rate is large\nenough to sustain a super-Eddington accretion towards the neutron core. The\nneutron core may collapse to a black hole after a while. A strong large-scale\noutflow or a jet can be launched from the super-Eddington accretion disk and\nthe collapsing Thorne-Zytkow object can be turned into an explosion. The ejecta\nhave about 10 Msun but the explosion energy depends on when the accretion is\nsuppressed. We presume that the explosion energy could be as low as ~ 1e47 erg\nand such a low-energy explosion could be observed like a failed supernova.

Whereas these\nprocesses have been subject to various studies, their relative contributions to\nGalactic Chemical Evolution are still a matter of debate. We investigate for\nthe first time the nucleosynthesis of p nuclides in GCE by including\nmetallicity and progenitor mass-dependent yields of core-collapse supernovae\n(ccSNe) into a chemical evolution model. We used a grid of metallicities and\nprogenitor masses from two different sets of stellar yields and followed the\ncontribution of ccSNe to the Galactic abundances as function of time. In\ncombination with previous studies on p-nucleus production in thermonuclear\nsupernovae (SNIa), and using the same GCE description, this allows us to\ncompare the respective roles of SNeIa and ccSNe in the production of p-nuclei\nin the Galaxy. The gamma process in ccSN is very efficient for a wide range of\nprogenitor masses (13M_sun_- 25M_sun) at solar metallicity. Since it is a\nsecondary process with its efficiency depending on the initial abundance of\nheavy elements, its contribution is strongly reduced below solar metallicity.\nThis makes it challenging to explain the inventory of the p nuclides in the\nSolar System by the contribution from ccSNe alone. In particular, we find that\nccSNe contribute less than 10% of the solar p nuclide abundances, with only a\nfew exceptions. Due to the uncertain contribution from other nucleosynthesis\nsites in ccSNe, such as neutrino winds or $\\alpha$-rich freeze out, we conclude\nthat the light p-nuclides 74$Se,78$Kr, 84Sr, and 92Mo may either still be\ncompletely or only partially produced in ccSNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2018 22:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

In this regard, an in-depth understating of the related\nSchottky barrier heights, associated with the incorporation of $MX_{2}$ sheets\ninto novel low-dimensional metal-semiconductor junctions, is of crucial\nimportance. Herein, we generate and provide analysis of the Schottky barrier\nheights behavior to account for the metal-induced gap states concept as its\nexplanation.

The results presented herein place charge\nneutrality levels in the vicinity of the mid-gap; this is in agreement with\nprevious reports and analogous to the behavior of three-dimensional\nsemiconductors.

These spectral shapes are then expressed in a simple set of polynomial\nfunctions of CR energy and regressively fitted until the high-energy ($>$100\nGeV) CR spectra near Earth and the Voyager-1 spectra at the heliopause are\nreproduced. We then extend the modeling to nuclear CR spectra and find that one\nspectral shape fits all local nuclear CRs and the apparent hardening of the\nnuclear CR spectra is caused by the roll-down of local nuclear spectra around\n100 - 200 GeV. All local CR spectra populate in a limited energy band below 100\n- 200 GeV and enhance gamma-ray emissivity below $\\sim$10 GeV.

The emergence of sparse representation\nmodels has shifted of the emphasis in frame theory toward sparse\nl1-minimization problems. In this paper, we apply frame theory to the sparse\nrepresentation of signals in which a synthesis dictionary is used for a frame\nand an analysis dictionary is used for a dual frame. We sought to formulate a\nnovel dual frame design in which the sparse vector obtained through the\ndecomposition of any signal is also the sparse solution representing signals\nbased on a reconstruction frame. Our findings demonstrate that this type of\ndual frame cannot be constructed for over-complete frames, thereby precluding\nthe use of any linear analysis operator in driving the sparse synthesis\ncoefficient for signal representation. Nonetheless, the best approximation to\nthe sparse synthesis solution can be derived from the analysis coefficient\nusing the canonical dual frame. In this study, we developed a novel dictionary\nlearning algorithm (called Parseval K-SVD) to learn a tight-frame dictionary.\nWe then leveraged the analysis and synthesis perspectives of signal\nrepresentation with frames to derive optimization formulations for problems\npertaining to image recovery. Our preliminary, results demonstrate that the\nimages recovered using this approach are correlated to the frame bounds of\ndictionaries, thereby demonstrating the importance of using different\ndictionaries for different applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 03:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

A\nsemantic inconsistency between the sentence and the video or between the words\nof a sentence can result in an inaccurate description. This paper introduces a\nnew problem, called Visual Text Correction (VTC), i.e., finding and replacing\nan inaccurate word in the textual description of a video. We propose a deep\nnetwork that can simultaneously detect an inaccuracy in a sentence, and fix it\nby replacing the inaccurate word(s). Our method leverages the semantic\ninterdependence of videos and words, as well as the short-term and long-term\nrelations of the words in a sentence. In our formulation, part of a visual\nfeature vector for every single word is dynamically selected through a gating\nprocess. Furthermore, to train and evaluate our model, we propose an approach\nto automatically construct a large dataset for VTC problem. Our experiments and\nperformance analysis demonstrates that the proposed method provides very good\nresults and also highlights the general challenges in solving the VTC problem.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind for the Visual\nText Correction task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 04:58:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 08:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 20:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

However, a recent study conducted by Mauro et al. reported the\nintriguing dynamics of the relaxation of a commercial Corning Gorilla Glass at\nroom temperature, over 1.5 years. Here, we report a novel atomistic simulation\nmethod allowing us to directly access the long-term (years) dynamics of glass\nrelaxation at room temperature. Based on the simulation of a series of mixed\nalkali silicate glasses, we demonstrate that room-temperature relaxation is a\ndirect consequence of the mixed alkali effect. Although both volume and energy\nfeature a stretched exponential relaxation, our results reveal a bifurcation of\nthe stretching exponents, with $\\beta$ = 3/5 and 3/7 for energy and volume\nrelaxation, respectively. Relaxation is found to occur through the diffusion of\nlocal stressed structural instabilities inside the atomic network, which anneal\neach other when a compressed atomic unit meets one that is under tension. The\ndriving force for such diffusion-trap relaxation mechanism is found to be at a\nmaximum when the concentrations of each alkali atom equal each other, which\narises from a balance between the concentration of each alkali atom and the\nmagnitude of the local stress that they undergo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 05:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

This is particularly true when individuals are enrolled to the system\nusing a single reference still. To improve the robustness of these systems, it\nis possible to augment the reference set by generating synthetic faces based on\nthe original still. However, without knowledge of the OD, many synthetic images\nmust be generated to account for all possible capture conditions. FR systems\nmay, therefore, require complex implementations and yield lower accuracy when\ntraining on many less relevant images. This paper introduces an algorithm for\ndomain-specific face synthesis (DSFS) that exploits the representative\nintra-class variation information available from the OD. Prior to operation, a\ncompact set of faces from unknown persons appearing in the OD is selected\nthrough clustering in the captured condition space. The domain-specific\nvariations of these face images are projected onto the reference stills by\nintegrating an image-based face relighting technique inside the 3D\nreconstruction framework. A compact set of synthetic faces is generated that\nresemble individuals of interest under the capture conditions relevant to the\nOD. In a particular implementation based on sparse representation\nclassification, the synthetic faces generated with the DSFS are employed to\nform a cross-domain dictionary that account for structured sparsity.\nExperimental results reveal that augmenting the reference gallery set of FR\nsystems using the proposed DSFS approach can provide a higher level of accuracy\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches, with only a moderate increase in its\ncomputational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 06:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 19:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Simultaneous access of multiple interfaces can\nsignificantly improve the users' quality of experience (QoE) in video\nstreaming. An intuitive approach to achieve it is to use Multi-path TCP\n(MPTCP). However, the deployment of MPTCP, especially with link preference,\nrequires OS kernel update at both the client and server side, and a vast amount\nof commercial content providers do not support MPTCP. Thus, in this paper, we\nrealize a multi-path video streaming algorithm in the application layer\ninstead, by considering Scalable Video Coding (SVC), where each layer of every\nchunk can be fetched from only one of the orthogonal paths. We formulate the\nquality decisions of video chunks subject to the available bandwidth of the\ndifferent paths, chunk deadlines, and link preferences as an optimization\nproblem. The objective is to to optimize a QoE metric that maintains a tradeoff\nbetween maximizing the playback rate of every chunk and ensuring fairness among\nchunks. The QoE is a weighted some of the following metrics: skip/stall\nduration, average playback rate, and quality switching rate. However, the\nweights are chosen such that pushing more chunks to the same quality level is\nmore preferable over any other choice. Even though the formulation is a\nnon-convex discrete optimization, we show that the problem can be solved\noptimally with a polynomial complexity in some special cases. We further\npropose an online algorithm where several challenges including bandwidth\nprediction errors, are addressed.

On account of SiO$_2$'s low density with respect to both the core\nand the lowermost mantle, we examine the process of SiO$_2$ accumulation at the\ncore-mantle boundary (CMB) and its incorporation into the mantle by buoyant\nrise. Today, if SiO$_2$ is 100-10000 times more viscous than lower mantle\nmaterial, the dimensions of SiO$_2$ diapirs formed by the viscous\nRayleigh-Taylor instability at the CMB would cause them to be swept into the\nmantle as inclusions of 100 m - 10 km diameter.

In\nour proposed hybrid DGM architectures, HfOx based (filamentary-type switching)\nOxRAM devices are extensively used for realizing multiple computational and\nnon-computational functions such as: (i) Synapses (weights), (ii) internal\nneuron-state storage, (iii) stochastic neuron activation and (iv) programmable\nsignal normalization. To validate the proposed scheme we have simulated two\ndifferent architectures: (i) Deep Belief Network (DBN) and (ii) Stacked\nDenoising Autoencoder for classification and reconstruction of hand-written\ndigits from a reduced MNIST dataset of 6000 images. Contrastive-divergence (CD)\nspecially optimized for OxRAM devices was used to drive the synaptic weight\nupdate mechanism of each layer in the network. Overall learning rule was based\non greedy-layer wise learning with no back propagation which allows the network\nto be trained to a good pre-training stage. Performance of the simulated hybrid\nCMOS-RRAM DGM model matches closely with software based model for a 2-layers\ndeep network. Top-3 test accuracy achieved by the DBN was 95.5%. MSE of the SDA\nnetwork was 0.003, lower than software based approach. Endurance analysis of\nthe simulated architectures show that for 200 epochs of training (single RBM\nlayer), maximum switching events/per OxRAM device was ~ 7000 cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 11:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

The modeling scale of the scheme is the mesh size\nand time step, and the ratios of the mesh size over particle mean free path or\nthe time step over particle collision time determine the local evolution regime\nof flow physics. For unsteady flow computation, due to the CFL condition the\ntime step in the explicit UGKS is limited by the smallest cell size in the\ncomputational domain. As a result, for a largely stretched non-uniform mesh the\nglobal time step becomes very small and the ratio of the time step over local\nparticle collision time may get a very small value. Under such a circumstance,\nthe physics in explicit UGKS may be constrained by the kinetic scale physics\nonly. The multiscale UGKS reduces into a single scale discrete velocity method\nwhere the free transport is used for the flux evaluation. In order to keep the\nadvantages of UGKS and improve the efficiency for unsteady flow computation,\nthe restriction from global CFL condition on the time step has to be removed.\nIn this paper, we develop an implicit UGKS (IUGKS) for unsteady flow by\nalternatively solving the macroscopic and microscopic governing equations\nwithin a step iteratively. In order to preserve the coherent flow evolution and\nmultiscale nature, the numerical flux is still evaluated by the explicit UGKS\nwith the local CFL condition. Therefore, the multiscale property of the UGKS\nmodeling is preserved over non-uniform meshes. Many numerical examples are\nincluded to validate the scheme for both continuum and rarefied flows.

The traditional method usually consists of two separate\nsteps, i.e., detecting moving objects with background subtraction running on\nthe camera, and filtering out nuisance motion events (e.g., trees, cloud,\nshadow, rain/snow, flag) with deep learning based object detection and tracking\nrunning on cloud. The method is extremely slow and therefore not cost\neffective, and does not fully leverage the spatial-temporal redundancies with a\npre-trained off-the-shelf object detector. To dramatically speedup relevant\nmotion event detection and improve its performance, we propose a novel network\nfor relevant motion event detection, ReMotENet, which is a unified, end-to-end\ndata-driven method using spatial-temporal attention-based 3D ConvNets to\njointly model the appearance and motion of objects-of-interest in a video.\nReMotENet parses an entire video clip in one forward pass of a neural network\nto achieve significant speedup. Meanwhile, it exploits the properties of home\nsurveillance videos, e.g., relevant motion is sparse both spatially and\ntemporally, and enhances 3D ConvNets with a spatial-temporal attention model\nand reference-frame subtraction to encourage the network to focus on the\nrelevant moving objects. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve\ncomparable or event better performance than the object detection based method\nbut with three to four orders of magnitude speedup (up to 20k times) on GPU\ndevices. Our network is efficient, compact and light-weight. It can detect\nrelevant motion on a 15s surveillance video clip within 4-8 milliseconds on a\nGPU and a fraction of second (0.17-0.39) on a CPU with a model size of less\nthan 1MB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 15:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

With a large input range of\ncounters and trackers combined with the high sensitivity of single-photon\ncounting, high-speed position tracking (upper bound recovery time of 0.9 s upon\n250 nm of step-like positional shift) not only of bright ensembles but also of\nlow-photon-collection-efficiency single to few NV centers is possible. The\ntracking requires position modulation of only 10 nm, which allows simultaneous\nposition tracking and pulsed measurements in the long term. Therefore, this\ntracking system enables measuring a single spin magnetic resonance and Rabi\noscillations at a very high resolution even without photon collection\noptimization.

We introduce a moving observer, which leads to\nthe traditional Lorentz relation for the time interval. We show that the\npresent approach can be used in stationary, moving, or rotating frames of\nreference, unlike the traditional special relativity, which applies only to the\ninertial moving frames. Then, we use the quaternion formulation of space-time\nand mass-energy equivalence to extend the quaternion relativity to space, mass,\nand energy. We demonstrate that the transition between the particle and\nobserver reference frames is equivalent to space inversion and can be described\nmathematically by quaternion conjugation.
