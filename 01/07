Using simulations for stellar evolution, radiation\nhydrodynamics, and radiative transfer, we study the explosion of stars with an\nextended and tenuous envelope (i.e., stars in which 95% of the mass is\ncontained within 10% of the surface radius or less). We consider both H-rich\nsupergiant and He-giant progenitors resulting from close-binary evolution and\ndying with a final mass of 2.8-5Msun. An extended envelope causes the supernova\n(SN) shock to brake and a reverse shock to form, sweeping core material into a\ndense shell. The shock deposited energy, which suffers little degradation from\nexpansion, is trapped in ejecta layers of moderate optical depth, thereby\nenhancing the SN luminosity at early times. With the delayed 56Ni heating, we\nfind that the resulting optical and near-IR light curves all exhibit a\ndouble-peak morphology. We show how an extended progenitor can explain the blue\nand featureless optical spectra of some Type IIb and Ib SNe. The dense shell\nformed by the reverse shock leads to line profiles with a smaller and\nnear-constant width. This ejecta property can explain the statistically\nnarrower profiles of Type IIb compared to Type Ib SNe, as well as the peculiar\nHalpha profile seen in SN1993J.

Solution of the integral equation relating the scattered\nfield with the field of the incident PPW, valid for arbitrary scattering\nintensity and arbitrary dissipative characteristics of the conductive medium,\nis analyzed. As a measure of the PPW scattering, the Hilbert norm of the\nintegral scattering operator is used. The strength of the scattering is shown\nto be determined not only by the parameters of the fluctuating impedance\n(dispersion, correlation radius and the length of the inhomogeneity region) but\nalso by the conductivity of the metal. If the scattering operator norm is\nsmall, the PPW is mainly scattered into the vacuum, thus losing its energy\nthrough the excitation of quasi-isotropic bulk Norton-type waves above the\nconducting surface. The intensity of the scattered field is expressed in terms\nof the random impedance pair correlation function, whose dependence on the\nincident and scattered wavenumbers shows that in the case of\nrandom-impedance-induced scattering of PPW it is possible to observe the effect\nanalogous to Wood's anomalies of wave scattering on periodic gratings. Under\nstrong scattering, when the scattering operator norm becomes large compared to\nunity, the radiation into free space is strongly suppressed, and, in the limit,\nthe incoming PPW is almost perfectly back-reflected from the inhomogeneous part\nof the interface. This suggests that within the model of a dissipation-free\nconducting medium, the surface polariton is unstable against arbitrary small\nfluctuations of the medium polarizability. Transition from quasi-isotropic weak\nscattering to nealy back-reflection under strong fluctuations of the impedance\nis interpreted in terms of Anderson localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2018 19:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

Obtaining samples from the full posterior\ndistribution, the Bayesian Lasso, confers major advantages in performance as\ncompared to having only the Lasso point estimate. Traditionally, the Bayesian\nLasso is implemented via Gibbs sampling methods which suffer from lack of\nscalability, unknown convergence rates, and generation of samples that are\nnecessarily correlated. We provide a measure transport approach to generate\ni.i.d samples from the posterior by constructing a transport map that\ntransforms a sample from the Laplacian prior into a sample from the posterior.\nWe show how the construction of this transport map can be parallelized into\nmodules that iteratively solve Lasso problems and perform closed-form linear\nalgebra updates.

In the\npresence of renewable energy integration and energy storage system, EV charging\nservice providers must deal with multiple uncertainties --- charging demand\nvolatility, inherent intermittency of renewable energy generation, and\nwholesale electricity price fluctuation. The motivation behind our work is to\noffer guidelines for charging service providers to determine proper charging\nprices and manage electricity to balance the competing objectives of improving\nprofitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on power\ngrid in spite of these uncertainties. We propose a new metric to assess the\nimpact on power grid without solving complete power flow equations. To protect\nservice providers from severe financial losses, a safeguard of profit is\nincorporated in the model. Two algorithms --- stochastic dynamic programming\n(SDP) algorithm and greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm) --- are applied to\nderive the pricing and electricity procurement policy. A Pareto front of the\nmultiobjective optimization is derived. Simulation results show that using SDP\nalgorithm can achieve up to 7% profit gain over using greedy algorithm.\nAdditionally, we observe that the charging service provider is able to reshape\nspatial-temporal charging demands to reduce the impact on power grid via\npricing signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 04:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

This adjustment, which is found based\non both pelvis and swing foot tracking errors, naturally takes the swing\ndynamics into account.

The efficiency of thermal conduction in\nthe intracluster medium (ICM) is complicated by the existence of turbulence and\nmagnetic fields, and has received a lot of attention in the literature.\nPrevious studies suggest that the magnetothermal instability developed in outer\nregions of galaxy clusters would drive magnetic field lines preferentially\nradial, resulting in efficient conduction along the radial direction. Using a\nseries of spherically-symmetric simulations, here we investigate the impact of\nthermal conduction on the observed temperature distributions in outer regions\nof three massive clusters, and find that thermal conduction substantially\nmodifies the ICM temperature profile. Within 3 Gyr, the gas temperature at a\nrepresentative radius of $0.3r_{500}$ typically decreases by ~10 - 20% and the\naverage temperature slope between $0.3r_{500}$ and $r_{500}$ drops by ~ 30 -\n40%, indicating that the observed ICM would not stay in a long-term equilibrium\nstate in the presence of thermal conduction. However, X-ray observations show\nthat the outer regions of massive clusters have remarkably similar\nradially-declining temperature profiles, suggesting that they should be quite\nstable. Our study thus suggests that the effective conductivity along the\nradial direction must be suppressed below the Spitzer value by a factor of 10\nor more, unless additional heating sources offset conductive cooling and\nmaintain the observed temperature distributions. Our study provides a\nsmoking-gun evidence for the suppression of parallel conduction along magnetic\nfield lines in low-collisionality plasmas by kinetic mirror or whistler\ninstabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 09:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 06:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Magnetic energy\naccumulates during the flux rope's gradual evolution along with the variation\nof magnetar surface magnetic structure before the eruption.

To study the distribution of preferences that emerge in\nsuch situations, a useful approach is to simulate opinion dynamics on top of\ncomplex networks, composed by nodes (individuals) and their connections\n(edges), where the state of each node can be one amongst several opinions\nincluding the undecided state. We use two different dynamics rules: the one\nproposed by Travieso-Fontoura (TF) and the plurality rule (PR), which are\nparadigmatic of outflow and inflow dynamics, respectively. We are specially\ninterested in the impact of the network randomness on the final distribution of\nopinions. For that purpose, we consider Watts-Strogatz networks, which possess\nthe small-world property, and where randomness is controlled by a probability\n$p$ of adding random shortcuts to an initially regular network. Depending on\nthe value of $p$, the average connectivity $\\langle k \\rangle$, and the initial\nconditions, the final distribution can be basically (i) consensus, (ii)\ncoexistence of different options, or (iii) predominance of indecision. We find\nthat, in both dynamics, the predominance of a winning opinion is favored by\nincreasing the number of reconnections (shortcuts), promoting consensus. In\ncontrast to the TF case, in the PR dynamics, a fraction of undecided nodes can\npersist in the final state. In such cases, a maximum number of undecided nodes\noccurs within the small-world region, due to ties in the decision group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 13:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

Previous studies have shown that the\naddition of the latest local $H_{0}$ measurement favors a larger spectral\nindex, and can exert a significant influence on the model selection of\ninflation. In this work, we investigate its impacts on the status of brane\ninflation models. We find that, when the direct $H_{0}$ measurement is\nconsidered, the prototype model of brane inflation is still in good agreement\nwith the current observational data within the $2\\sigma$ level range. For the\nKKLMMT model, the consideration of the $H_{0}$ measurement allows the range of\nthe parameter $\\beta$ to be amplified to ${\\cal O}(10^{-2})$, which slightly\nalleviates the fine-tuning problem. For the IR DBI model, the addition of the\n$H_{0}$ measurement does not provide a better fit. These results show that the\nconsideration of the new $H_{0}$ prior can exert a considerable influence on\nthe brane inflation models.

A missing piece in the optical\nmodel of those SiL simulations is the sharpness, given in linear system theory\nby the point-spread function (PSF) of the optical system. We present a novel\nnumerical model for the PSF of an optical system that can efficiently model\nboth experimental measurements and lens design simulations of the PSF. The\nnumerical basis for this model is a non-linear regression of the PSF with an\nartificial neural network (ANN). The novelty lies in the portability and the\nparameterization of this model, which allows to apply this model in basically\nany conceivable optical simulation scenario, e.g. inserting a measured lens\ninto a computer game to train autonomous vehicles. We present a lens\nmeasurement series, yielding a numerical function for the PSF that depends only\non the parameters defocus, field and azimuth. By convolving existing images and\nvideos with this PSF model we apply the measured lens as a transfer function,\ntherefore generating an image as if it were seen with the measured lens itself.\nApplications of this method are in any optical scenario, but we focus on the\ncontext of autonomous driving, where quality of the detection algorithms\ndepends directly on the optical quality of the used camera system. With the\nparameterization of the optical model we present a method to validate the\nfunctional and safety limits of camera-based ADAS based on the real, measured\nlens actually used in the product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 15:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

However, due to the restrictions imposed by the social network service\nproviders, the resources available to fetch the entire contents of a social\nnetwork are typically very limited. As a result, analysis of dynamic social\nnetwork data requires maintaining an approximate copy of the social network for\neach time period, locally. In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic\nnetwork and text fetching with limited probing capacities, for identifying and\nmaintaining influential users as the social network evolves. We propose an\nalgorithm to probe the relationships (required for global influence\ncomputation) as well as posts (required for topic-based influence computation)\nof a limited number of users during each probing period, based on the influence\ntrends and activities of the users. We infer the current network based on the\nnewly probed user data and the last known version of the network maintained\nlocally. Additionally, we propose to use link prediction methods to further\nincrease the accuracy of our network inference. We employ PageRank as the\nmetric for influence computation. We illustrate how the proposed solution\nmaintains accurate PageRank scores for computing global influence, and\ntopic-sensitive weighted PageRank scores for topic-based influence. The latter\nrelies on a topic-based network constructed via weights determined by semantic\nanalysis of posts and their sharing statistics. We evaluate the effectiveness\nof our algorithms by comparing them with the true influence scores of the full\nand up-to-date version of the network, using data from the micro-blogging\nservice Twitter.

For a single-user mmWave system\nemploying distributed antenna subarray architecture in which the transmitter\nand receiver consist of Kt and Kr subarrays, respectively, an asymptotic\nmultiplexing gain formula is firstly derived when the numbers of antennas at\nsubarrays go to infinity. Specifically, assuming that all subchannels have the\nsame average number of propagation paths L, the formula implies that by\nemploying such a distributed antenna-subarray architecture, an exact average\nmaximum multiplexing gain of KrKtL can be achieved. This result means that\ncompared to the co-located antenna architecture, using the distributed\nantenna-subarray architecture can scale up the maximum multiplexing gain\nproportionally to KrKt. In order to further reveal the relation between\ndiversity gain and multiplexing gain, a simple characterization of the\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff is also given. The multiplexing gain analysis\nis then extended to the multiuser scenario. Moreover, simulation results\nobtained with the hybrid analog/digital processing corroborate the analysis\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 08:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 09:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 06:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

During group interactions, members take on different\nroles within the discussion. Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral\nengagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution\ncharacteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material),\nand social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of\nthese roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, being\neither less or more productive towards collective goals. In online\ncollaborative learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning\noutcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and\nvalidate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from the participants'\ncontributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group\ncommunication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic\ntechniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group\ncommunication. The GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction\ndatasets (participant N = 2,429; group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear\nmixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and\nthe influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results\nindicate that participants' patterns in linguistic coordination and cohesion\nare representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative\ndiscussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore\nthe micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with the participants'\nroles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 15:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}
