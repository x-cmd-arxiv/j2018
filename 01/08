To improve overall generalization, all types of variations\nin the environment have to be taken under consideration via different level of\ndata augmentation steps. To this end, we propose House3D, a rich, extensible\nand efficient environment that contains 45,622 human-designed 3D scenes of\nvisually realistic houses, ranging from single-room studios to multi-storied\nhouses, equipped with a diverse set of fully labeled 3D objects, textures and\nscene layouts, based on the SUNCG dataset (Song et.al.).

Since the first isolation of graphene in 2004,\nthe number of new 2D materials with favorable properties for electronics has\nbeen growing. Dopants in 2 dimensional systems are more tightly bound and\npotentially easier to position and manipulate. Considering the properties of\ncurrently available 2D materials, we access the feasibility of such proposal in\nterms of the manipulability of isolated dopants (for single qubit operations)\nand dopant pairs (for two qubit operations). Our results indicate that a wide\nvariety of 2D materials may perform at least as well as the currently studied\nbulk host for donor qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 18:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

Generally, the rate of training deep models reduces\nseverely after multiple iterations. A key reason for this phenomenon is that a\ndeep network is expressed using a highly non-convex finite-dimensional model,\nand thus the parameter gets stuck in a local optimum. Because of this, methods\noften suffer not only from degeneration of the convergence speed but also from\nlimitations in the representational power of the trained network. To overcome\nthis issue, we propose an additional layer called the gradient layer to seek a\ndescent direction in an infinite-dimensional space. Because the layer is\nconstructed in the infinite-dimensional space, we are not restricted by the\nspecific model structure of finite-dimensional models. As a result, we can get\nout of the local optima in finite-dimensional models and move towards the\nglobal optimal function more directly. In this paper, this phenomenon is\nexplained from the functional gradient method perspective of the gradient\nlayer. Interestingly, the optimization procedure using the gradient layer\nnaturally constructs the deep structure of the network. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that this procedure can be regarded as a discretization method of\nthe gradient flow that naturally reduces the objective function. Finally, the\nmethod is tested using several numerical experiments, which show its fast\nconvergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 18:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 10:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

Here we study this relation within the\nframework of the modified gravity model MOND. The field equations of MOND\nautomatically imply the radial acceleration relation for spherically symmetric\ngalaxies, but for disk galaxies deviations from the relation are expected. Here\nwe investigate whether these deviations are of sufficient magnitude to bring\nMOND into conflict with the observed relation. In the quasilinear formulation\nof MOND, to calculate the gravitational field of a given distribution of\nmatter, an intermediate step is to calculate the \"pristine field\", which is a\nsimple nonlinear function of the Newtonian field corresponding to the same\ndistribution of matter. Hence, to the extent that the quasilinear gravitational\nfield is approximately equal to the pristine field, the radial acceleration\nrelation will be satisfied. We show that the difference between the quasilinear\nand pristine fields obeys the equations of magnetostatics, the curl of the\npristine field serves as the source for the difference in the two fields, much\nas currents serve as sources for the magnetic field. Using the magnetostatic\nanalogy we numerically study the difference between the pristine and\nquasilinear fields for simple model galaxies with a Gaussian profile. Our\nprincipal finding is that the difference between the fields is small compared\nto the observational uncertainties and that quasilinear MOND is therefore\ncompatible with the observed radial acceleration relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 19:39:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 21:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 18:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

We demonstrate how the dual approximate dynamic programming\nmethod of Barty, Carpentier, and Girardeau (RAIRO Operations Research,\n44:167-183, 2010) can be adapted to obtain bounds and a policy for this\nproblem. Previous approaches have let the Lagrange multipliers depend only on\ntime; this can result in weak lower bounds. Other approaches have let the\nmultipliers depend on the entire history of past random observations; although\nthis provides a strong lower bound, its ability to handle a large number of\nsample paths or scenarios is limited. We demonstrate how to bridge these\napproaches for the stochastic unit commitment problem by letting the\nmultipliers depend on the current observed demand. This allows a good tradeoff\nbetween strong lower bounds and good scalability with the number of scenarios.\nWe illustrate this approach numerically on a 168-stage stochastic unit\ncommitment problem, including minimum uptime, downtime, and ramping\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2018 22:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 17:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

However, a recovery process that can\npreserve identity is challenging because the fine details of real faces can be\ndistorted or lost in stylized images. In this paper, we present a new\nIdentity-preserving Face Recovery from Portraits (IFRP) to recover latent\nphotorealistic faces from unaligned stylized portraits. Our IFRP method\nconsists of two components: Style Removal Network (SRN) and Discriminative\nNetwork (DN). The SRN is designed to transfer feature maps of stylized images\nto the feature maps of the corresponding photorealistic faces. By embedding\nspatial transformer networks into the SRN, our method can compensate for\nmisalignments of stylized faces automatically and output aligned realistic face\nimages. The role of the DN is to enforce recovered faces to be similar to\nauthentic faces. To ensure the identity preservation, we promote the recovered\nand ground-truth faces to share similar visual features via a distance measure\nwhich compares features of recovered and ground-truth faces extracted from a\npre-trained VGG network. We evaluate our method on a large-scale synthesized\ndataset of real and stylized face pairs and attain state of the art results. In\naddition, our method can recover photorealistic faces from previously unseen\nstylized portraits, original paintings and human-drawn sketches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 00:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 23:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

To reflect the\nclustered structure with limited cross-cluster communication bandwidths, nodes\nin the same cluster are set to communicate $\\beta_I$ symbols, while nodes in\nother clusters can communicate $\\beta_c \\leq \\beta_I$ symbols with one another.\nWe provide two types of exact regenerating codes which achieve the capacity of\nclustered distributed storage: the minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) codes\nand the minimum-storage-regenerating (MSR) codes. First, we construct MBR codes\nfor general parameter settings of clustered distributed storage. The suggested\nMBR code is a generalization of an existing code proposed by Rashmi et al., for\nscenarios where storage nodes are dispersed into L > 1 clusters. The proposed\nMBR code for the $\\beta_c = 0$ case requires a much smaller field size compared\nto existing local MBR codes. Secondly, we devise MSR codes for clustered\ndistributed storage.

By examining the\nclass of distributions over the logarithm of the local shrinkage parameter that\nhave log-linear, or sub-log-linear tails, we show that many standard prior\ndistributions for local shrinkage parameters can be unified in terms of the\ntail behaviour and concentration properties of their corresponding marginal\ndistributions over the coefficients $\\beta_j$.

Sometimes it is important, given a subgroup $G$ of\n$\\Aut(P)$, to find $\\wp$ along which $G$ lifts but no further automorphism of\n$P$ does.

If the isolation mass is very small, then\ngas accretion is protracted and the planet remains at a few Earth masses with a\nmainly solid composition. For larger values of the pebble isolation mass, the\nplanet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into\na gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation\nmass with cube of the disc aspect ratio. Here we expand on previous\nmeasurements and explore the dependency of the pebble isolation mass on all\nrelevant parameters of the protoplanetary disc. We use 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations to measure the pebble isolation mass and derive a simple scaling\nlaw that captures the dependence on the local disc structure and the turbulent\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$. We find that small pebbles, coupled to the gas,\nwith Stokes number $\\tau_{\\rm f}<0.005$ can drift through the partial gap at\npebble isolation mass. However, as the planetary mass increases, particles must\nbe decreasingly smaller to penetrate through the pressure bump. Turbulent\ndiffusion of particles, however, can lead to an increase of the pebble\nisolation mass by a factor of two, depending on the strength of the background\nviscosity and on the pebble size. We finally explore the implications of the\nnew scaling law of the pebble isolation mass on the formation of planetary\nsystems by numerically integrating the growth and migration pathways of planets\nin evolving protoplanetary discs. Compared to models neglecting the dependence\nof the pebble isolation mass on the $\\alpha$-viscosity, our models including\nthis effect result in larger core masses for giant planets. These larger core\nmasses are more akin to the core masses of the giant planets in the Solar\nSystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 08:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:14:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 12:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Assuming\nthe initially narrow (classical-like) standard deviations for the an- gle and\nthe angular momentum of the rotator, we investigate dynamics of the first and\nsecond moments depending on the size, i.e., on the number of blades of both the\nfree rotator as well as of the rotator in the external har- monic field.

In addition, a particular class of profiles, so-called\nsech(xi)-type profiles, exhibit high agility and in the same time parsimony. In\nthis paper we go further into the description of these solvable profiles and\ntheir properties. Most importantly, their quadrupole formulation is provided\nwhich allows building smooth synthetic profiles of effusivity of arbitrary\ncomplexity and thereafter getting very easily the corresponding temperature\ndynamic response. Examples are given with increasing variability of effusivity\nand increasing number of elementary profiles. These highly flexible profiles\nare equally relevant for providing an exact analytical solution to wave\npropagation problems in 1D graded media (i.e. Maxwell's equations, acoustic\nequation, telegraph equation...). From now on, let it be for diffusion-like or\nwave-like problems, when the leading properties present (possibly piecewise-)\ncontinuously heterogeneous profiles, the classical staircase model can be\nadvantageously replaced by a \"high-level\" quadrupole model consisting of one or\nmore sech(xi)-type profiles, which makes the latter a true Swiss-Army knife for\nanalytical modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 09:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Evidence of its ubiquity and\nseverity can be seen in a range of phenomena, from disease epidemics to\nfinancial systemic risk. In order to understand the dynamics of these critical\nphenomena, computational models map the probability of propagation as a\nfunction of direct exposure, typically in the form of pairwise interactions\nbetween components. By doing so, the important role of indirect interactions\nremains unexplored. In response, we develop a simple model that accounts for\nthe effect of both direct and subsequent exposure, which we deploy in the novel\ncontext of failure propagation within a real-world engineering project. We show\nthat subsequent exposure has a significant effect in key aspects, including\nthe: (a) final spreading event size, (b) propagation rate, and (c) spreading\nevent structure. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of hidden\ninfluentials in large-scale spreading events, and evaluate the role of direct\nand subsequent exposure in their emergence.

However, the characterization of the coding rate\nregion therein involves uncountably many linear inequalities and the constant\nterm (i.e., the lower bound) in each inequality is given in terms of the\nsolution of a linear optimization problem. Thus this implicit characterization\nof the coding rate region does not enable the determination of the\nachievability of a given rate tuple. In this paper, we first obtain closed-form\nexpressions of these uncountably many inequalities. Then we identify a finite\nsubset of inequalities that is sufficient for characterizing the coding rate\nregion. This gives an explicit characterization of the coding rate region. We\nfurther show by the symmetry of the problem that only a much smaller subset of\nthis finite set of inequalities needs to be verified in determining the\nachievability of a given rate tuple.

Working with cross spectrum greatly reduces the effect of radio\nfrequency interference (RFI) compared with using auto spectrum. Single pulse\ndetection confidence increases by cross identifying detections from multiple\nbaselines. By combining the power of multiple baselines, we may improve the\ndetection sensitivity.

We estimate the dynamical robustness of such\nnetworks by introducing a variant of the concept of multi-node basin stability,\nwhich allows us to gauge the global stability of the dynamics of the network in\nresponse to local perturbations affecting a certain class of nodes of a system.\nWe show that perturbing nodes with high closeness and betweeness-centrality\nsignificantly reduces the capacity of the system to return to the desired\nstate. This effect is very pronounced for a star network which has one hub node\nwith significantly different closeness/betweeness-centrality than all the\nperipheral nodes. In such a network, perturbation of the single hub node has\nthe capacity to destroy the collective state. On the other hand, even when a\nmajority of the peripheral nodes are strongly perturbed, the hub manages to\nrestore the system to its original state, demonstrating the drastic effect of\nthe centrality of the perturbed node on the dynamics of the network. Further,\nwe explore explore Random Scale-Free Networks of bi-stable dynamical elements.\nWe exploit the difference in the distribution of betweeness centralities,\ncloseness centralities and degrees of the nodes in Random Scale-Free Networks\nwith m=1 and m=2, to probe which centrality property most influences the\nrobustness of the collective dynamics in these heterogeneous networks.\nSignificantly, we find clear evidence that the betweeness centrality of the\nperturbed node is more crucial for dynamical robustness, than closeness\ncentrality or degree of the node. This result is important in deciding which\nnodes to safeguard in order to maintain the collective state of this network\nagainst targeted localized attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 12:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

These servers are not\nsimply added together; the random hashing complicates the behavior. To this\nend, we derive the asymptotic miss ratio of data item requests on a LRU cluster\nwith consistent hashing.

This equivalence can be established rigorously under the condition that\nthe cache sizes of the individual servers are large. For typical data caching\nsystems this condition is common.

The bounded region can be quite general: it can consist of finitely\nmany points, or be a curve, a curved surface or a bounded volume. The optimum\noptical field is eigenfield corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of a\ncompact linear integral operator which depends on the bounded region. It is\nexplained how these optimum fields can be realized by focusing appropriate\npupil fields.

The detection of\nhydration is, in principle, inconsistent with a pure metallic origin of this\nbody.

The proposed design combines vertical\ntakeoff and landing (VTOL), precise hover capabilities of a quadrotor\nhelicopter and high range, endurance and high forward cruise speed\ncharacteristics of a fixed wing aircraft. The proposed UAV is designed for a\nmission requirement of carrying and delivering 6 kg payload to a destination at\n16 km from the point of origin. First, the design of proprotors is carried out\nusing a physics based modified Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) analysis,\nwhich is validated using experimental data generated for the purpose.\nProprotors have conflicting requirement for optimal hover and forward flight\nperformance. Next, the biplane wings are designed using simple lifting line\ntheory. The airframe design is followed by power plant selection and\ntransmission design. Finally, weight estimation is carried out to complete the\ndesign process. The proprotor design with 24 deg preset angle and -24 deg twist\nis designed based on 70% weightage to forward flight and 30% weightage to\nhovering flight conditions. The operating RPM of the proprotors is reduced from\n3200 during hover to 2000 during forward flight to ensure optimal performance\nduring cruise flight. The estimated power consumption during forward flight\nmode is 64% less than that required for hover, establishing the benefit of this\nhybrid concept.

This large-size star is\nexpected to be a red supergiant star with an initial mass of $\\gtrsim$ 19 -- 20\nM$_{\\odot}$ based on the mass $--$ radius relation of the Galactic red\nsupergiants, and it represents one of the most largest and massive progenitors\nfound for SNe IIP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 09:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

Although reversible video watermarking has successfully been\napplied in multimedia, its application has not been extensively explored in\nmedical videos. Reversible watermarking in medical videos is still a\nchallenging problem. The existing reversible video watermarking algorithms,\nwhich are based on error prediction expansion, use motion vectors for\nprediction. In this study, we propose an adaptive reversible watermarking\nmethod for medical videos. We suggest using temporal correlations for improving\nthe prediction accuracy. Hence, two temporal neighbor pixels in upcoming frames\nare used alongside the four spatial rhombus neighboring pixels to minimize the\nprediction error. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this\nmethod is applied to medical videos. The method helps to protect patients'\npersonal and medical information by watermarking, i.e., increase the security\nof Health Information Systems (HIS). Experimental results demonstrate the high\nquality of the proposed watermarking method based on PSNR metric and a large\ncapacity for data hiding in medical videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 05:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 17:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}
