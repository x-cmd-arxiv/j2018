In other words, we show that a value-transfer\nledger like Bitcoin has the potential to scale-out by its nature without\nsacrificing security or decentralization.

A beneficial consequence of our design is that nodes will\nspontaneously try to reduce their transmission cost by only providing the\ntransactions needed to show that their transactions are double-spending-proof.\nAs a result, the network is sharded as each node only acquires part of the\ntransaction record and a scale-out throughput could be achieved, which we call\n\"spontaneous sharding\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 16:10:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 11:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

In contrast with\nconservative glide motion, climb relies on the point defects' thermal diffusion\nand hence operates on much longer timescales, leading to some forms of creep.\nWhilst equilibrium point defect concentrations allow dislocations to climb to\nrelieve non-glide stresses, point defect supersaturations also lead to osmotic\nforces, driving dislocation motion even in the absence of external stresses.\nSelf-interstitial atoms typically have significantly higher formation energies\nthan vacancies, so their contribution to climb is usually ignored. However,\nunder irradiation conditions, both types of defect are athermally created in\nequal numbers. In this letter, we use simple thermodynamic arguments to show\nthat the contribution of interstitials cannot be neglected in irradiated\nmaterials, and that the osmotic force they induce on dislocations is many\norders of magnitude larger than that caused by vacancies. This explains why the\nprismatic dislocation loops observed by {\\it in situ} transmission electron\nmicroscope irradiations are more often of interstitial rather than vacancy\ncharacter. Using discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, we investigate the\neffect on dislocation-obstacle interactions, and find reductions in the\ndepinning time of many orders of magnitude.

While the bulk of this\npopulation is likely the result of a close encounter between a stellar binary\nand the supermassive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic Centre (GC), other\nmechanims may contribute fast stars to the sample. Few observed HVSs show\napparent ages which are shorter than the flight time from the GC, thereby\nmaking the binary disruption scenario unlikely. These stars may be the result\nof the breakup of a stellar triple in the GC which led to the ejection of a\nhypervelocity binary (HVB).

The proposed solution is widely applicable and is\nshown to retain the usual properties of the modified profile likelihood. The\napproach is examined in two instances particularly relevant in applications,\ni.e. missing-data models and survival models with unspecified censoring\ndistribution. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated via\nsimulation studies and two clinical trial applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 18:20:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 08:29:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 15:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

However, subharmonic responses are also a well-known feature of\nclassical dynamical systems ranging from predator-prey models to Faraday waves\nand AC-driven charge density waves. This raises the question of whether these\nclassical phenomena display the same rigidity characteristic of a quantum DTC.\nIn this work, we explore this question in the context of periodically driven\nHamiltonian dynamics coupled to a finite-temperature bath, which provides both\nfriction and, crucially, noise. Focusing on one-dimensional chains, where in\nequilibrium any transition would be forbidden at finite temperature, we provide\nevidence that the combination of noise and interactions drives a sharp,\nfirst-order dynamical phase transition between a discrete time-translation\ninvariant phase and an activated classical discrete time crystal (CDTC) in\nwhich time-translation symmetry is broken out to exponentially-long time\nscales.

To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we calculate the\nresponse of the system to an external magnetic field, the dependence of the\neffective chemical potential on the work function difference, and the\ndependence of the effective semiconductor-superconductor coupling on the\napplied gate potential. We find that different low-energy bands are\ncharacterized by similar effective couplings, which results in induced gap\nfeatures characterized by a single energy scale. We also find that\nelectrostatic effects are responsible for a partial suppression of the Majorana\nenergy splitting oscillations. Finally, we show that a position-dependent work\nfunction difference can produce a non-homogeneous effective potential that is\nnot affected by the screening due to the superconductor and is only partially\nsuppressed by the charge inside the wire. In turn, this potential can induce\ntrivial low-energy states that mimic the phenomenology of Majorana zero modes.\nThus, any position-dependent work function difference (even at the 1% level)\nalong the nanowire must be avoided through carefully engineered\nsemiconductor-superconductor interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 19:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 16:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

We identify 258 dwarf\ngalaxy candidates with luminosities $-17 < M_{g'} < -8$ mag, corresponding to\ntypical stellar masses of $9.5\\gtrsim \\log{\\cal M}_{\\star}/M_\\odot \\gtrsim\n5.5$, reaching $\\sim\\!3$ mag deeper in point-source luminosity and $\\sim\\!4$\nmag deeper in surface-brightness sensitivity compared to the classic Fornax\nCluster Catalog. Morphological analysis shows that surface-brightness profiles\nare well represented by single-component S\\'ersic models with average S\\'ersic\nindices of $\\langle n\\rangle_{u',g',i'}=(0.78-0.83) \\pm 0.02$, and average\neffective radii of $\\langle r_e\\rangle_{u',g',i'}\\!=(0.67-0.70) \\pm 0.02$ kpc.\nColor-magnitude relations indicate a flattening of the galaxy red sequence at\nfaint galaxy luminosities, similar to the one recently discovered in the Virgo\ncluster. A comparison with population synthesis models and the galaxy\nmass-metallicity relation reveals that the average faint dwarf galaxy is likely\nolder than ~5 Gyr. We study galaxy scaling relations between stellar mass,\neffective radius, and stellar mass surface density over a stellar mass range\ncovering six orders of magnitude. We find that over the sampled stellar mass\nrange several distinct mechanisms of galaxy mass assembly can be identified: i)\ndwarf galaxies assemble mass inside the half-mass radius up to $\\log{\\cal\nM}_{\\star}$ ~8.0, ii) isometric mass assembly in the range $8.0 < \\log{\\cal\nM}_{\\star}/M_\\odot < 10.5$, and iii) massive galaxies assemble stellar mass\npredominantly in their halos at $\\log{\\cal M}_{\\star}$ ~10.5 and above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 19:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Providing observational\nconstraints on the locations of the major snowlines is therefore crucial for\nfully connecting planet compositions to their formation mechanism.\nUnfortunately, the most important snowline, that of water, is very difficult to\nobserve directly in protoplanetary disks due to its close proximity to the\ncentral star. Based on chemical considerations, HCO$^+$ is predicted to be a\ngood chemical tracer of the water snowline, because it is particularly abundant\nin dense clouds when water is frozen out. This work maps the optically thin\nisotopologue H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J=3-2$) toward the envelope of the low-mass\nprotostar NGC1333-IRAS2A (observed with NOEMA at ~0.9\" resolution), where the\nsnowline is at larger distance from the star than in disks. The H$^{13}$CO$^+$\nemission peaks ~2\" northeast of the continuum peak, whereas the previously\nobserved H$_2^{18}$O shows compact emission on source. Quantitative modeling\nshows that a decrease in H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundance by at least a factor of six\nis needed in the inner ~360 AU to reproduce the observed emission profile.\nChemical modeling predicts indeed a steep increase in HCO$^+$ just outside the\nwater snowline; the 50% decrease in gaseous H$_2$O at the snowline is not\nenough to allow HCO$^+$ to be abundant. This places the water snowline at 225\nAU, further away from the star than expected based on the 1D envelope\ntemperature structure for NGC1333-IRAS2A. In contrast, DCO$^+$ observations\nshow that the CO snowline is at the expected location, making an outburst\nscenario unlikely. The spatial anticorrelation of the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and\nH$_2^{18}$O emission provide a proof of concept that H$^{13}$CO$^+$ can be used\nas a tracer of the water snowline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

Starting from a general\nconvolutional neural network architecture, we allow the model to learn\nindividual characteristics of the first night of sleep in order to quantify\nsleep stages of the second night. While the original neural network allows to\nsleep stage on a public database with a state of the art accuracy,\npersonalizing the model further increases performance (on the order of two\npercentage points on average, but more for difficult subjects). This\nimprovement is particularly present in subjects where the original algorithm\ndid not perform well (typically subjects with accuracy less than $80\\%$).\nLooking deeper, we find that optimal classification can be achieved when broad\nknowledge of sleep staging in general (at least 20 separate nights) is combined\nwith subject-specific knowledge. We hypothesize that this method will be very\nvaluable for improving scoring of lower quality sleep recordings, such as those\nfrom wearable devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 19:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

Replenishment lead times are random, independent\nidentically distributed, causing orders to cross in time. We develop a new\ninventory policy to exploit implications of lead time randomness and order\ncrossover, and evaluate its performance by asymptotic analysis and simulations.\nOur policy does not follow the basic principle of Constant Base Stock (CBS)\npolicy, or more generally, (s,S) and (r,Q) policies, which is to keep the\ninventory position within a fixed range. Instead, it uses the current inventory\nlevel (= inventory-on-hand minus backlog) to set a dynamic target for inventory\nin-transit, and place orders to follow this target. Our policy includes CBS\npolicy as a special case, under a particular choice of a policy parameter. We\nshow that our policy can significantly reduce the average inventory cost\ncompared with CBS policy. Specifically, we prove that if the lead time is\nexponentially distributed, then under our policy, with properly chosen policy\nparameters, the expected (absolute) inventory level scales as $o(\\sqrt{r})$, as\nthe demand rate $r\\to\\infty$. In comparison, it is known to scale as\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{r})$ under CBS policy. In particular, this means that, as\n$r\\to\\infty$, the average inventory cost under our policy vanishes in\ncomparison with that under CBS policy. Furthermore, our simulations show that\nthe advantage of our policy remains to be substantial under non-exponential\nlead time distributions, and may even be greater than under exponential\ndistribution. We also use simulations to compare GBS to an optimal policy for\nsome cases where computing the optimal cost is tractable. The results show that\nour policy removes a majority of excess costs of CBS policy over the minimum\ncost, leading to much smaller optimality gaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 19:10:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 23:32:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 00:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 01:48:40 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Combining resolved dust\nmeasurements from the NOEMA interferometer with Hubble Space Telescope Halpha\nmaps and multicolor imaging (including new UV data from the HDUV survey), we\nfind a bulge growing by dust-obscured star formation: while the unobscured star\nformation is centrally suppressed, the dust continuum is centrally\nconcentrated, filling in the ring-like structures evident in the Halpha and UV\nemission. Reflecting this, the dust emission is more compact than the\noptical/UV tracers of star formation with r_e(dust)=3.4kpc,\nr_e(Halpha)/r_e(dust)=1.4, and r_e(UV)/r_e(dust)=1.8.

Less well recognized is the corollary that, because they are polar and\ntherefore lack inversion symmetry, PNRs are also piezoelectric at the nanoscale\nand can therefore behave as nanoresonators. Using the particular relaxor\nferroelectric K$_{\\tt1-x}$Li$_{\\tt x}$TaO$_{\\tt 3}$ (KLT), we show that, when\nelectrically excited into oscillation, these piezoelectric nanoresonators can\ndrive macroscopic electro-mechanical resonances. Unexpectedly however, pairs of\ncoupled resonances are observed, with one of the two exhibiting a\ncharacteristic Fano-like lineshape. The complex resonance spectra can be\ndescribed equally well by two alternative but complementary models both\ninvolving two resonances coupled through a relaxation: a purely classical one\nbased on two coupled damped harmonic oscillators and a semi-classical based on\ntwo discrete excitations coupled to each other through a continuum. Together,\nthey provide complementary perspectives on the underlying physics of the\nsystem. Both reproduce the rapid evolution of the resonance spectrum across\nthree wide temperature ranges, including a phase transition range. In the high\ntemperature range, the coupling between modes is due to the collective $\\pi$\nrelaxation of the lithium ions within PNRs and in the phase transition range to\n\"heterophase relaxation\" of the surrounding lattice between its high\ntemperature cubic and low temperature tetragonal phases. The coupling is\nsuppressed in the intermediate range of the collective $\\pi/2$ relaxation of\nthe lithium ions.

Here\nwe explore the possibility that 'Oumuamua-like ISAs are produced in tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs) of refractory planetoids (asteroids, dwarf planets,\netc.) by the white dwarfs (WDs). This idea is supported by existing\nspectroscopic observations of metal-polluted WDs, hinting at predominantly\nvolatile-poor composition of accreted material. We show that such TDEs sourced\nby realistic planetary systems (including a population of >1000 km planetoids\nand massive perturbers - Neptune-to-Saturn mass planets) can eject to\ninterstellar space up to 30% of planetary mass involved in them. Collisional\nfragmentation, caused by convergent vertical motion of the disrupted\nplanetoid's debris inside the Roche sphere of the WD, channels most of the\noriginal mass into 0.1-1 km fragments, similar to 'Oumuamua. Such size spectrum\nof ISAs (very different from the top-heavy distributions expected in other\nscenarios) implies that planetary TDEs can account for a significant fraction\n(up to ~30% under optimistic assumptions) of the ISAs. This figure is based on\nexisting observations of WD metal pollution and accounts for observational\nbiases by using realistic models of circum-WD planetary systems. ISAs should\nexhibit kinematic characteristics similar to old, dynamically hot Galactic\npopulations; we interpret 'Oumuamua's slow Galactic motion as a statistical\nfluctuation. ISA ejection in individual planetary TDEs is highly anisotropic,\nresulting in large fluctuations of their space density.

There are many natural instances\nwhere the object in question has high rank with respect to the classical\nnotions of rank: matrix rank, tensor rank, multilinear rank --- the latter two\nbeing the most straightforward generalizations of the former. To remedy this,\nwe show that one may vastly expand these classical notions of ranks: Given any\nundirected graph $G$, there is a notion of $G$-rank associated with $G$, which\nprovides us with as many different kinds of ranks as there are undirected\ngraphs. In particular, the popular tensor network states in physics (e.g.,\n\\textsc{mps}, \\textsc{ttns}, \\textsc{peps}) may be regarded as functions of a\nspecific $G$-rank for various choices of $G$. Among other things, we will see\nthat a function, matrix, or tensor may have very high matrix, tensor, or\nmultilinear rank and yet very low $G$-rank for some $G$. In fact the difference\nis in the orders of magnitudes and the gaps between $G$-ranks and these\nclassical ranks are arbitrarily large for some important objects in computer\nscience, mathematics, and physics.

The low\nluminosity of the gamma-rays and the rising non-thermal flux from the source at\nlate times could indicate that we are outside the opening angle of the beamed\nrelativistic jet. Alternatively, the emission could be arising from a cocoon of\nmaterial formed from the interaction between a jet and the merger ejecta.

Flux correlations are decomposed into those within\neach absorption line (the 1-absorber term) and those between separate lines\n(the 2-absorber term), treating the lines as biased tracers of the underlying\nmatter fluctuations. While the nonlinear exponential mapping between optical\ndepth and flux requires an infinite series of moments to calculate any\nstatistic, we show that this series can be resumed (truncating at the desired\norder in the linear matter overdensity). We focus on the $z=2-3$ line-of-sight\npower spectrum.

With more data storage needs turning over to\nthe cloud, finding a secure and efficient data access structure has become a\nmajor research issue. With different access privileges, individuals with more\nprivileges (at higher levels of the hierarchy) are granted access to more\nsensitive data than those with fewer privileges (at lower levels of the\nhierarchy). In this paper, a Privilege-based Multilevel Organizational\nData-sharing scheme~(P-MOD) is proposed that incorporates a privilege-based\naccess structure into an attribute-based encryption mechanism to handle these\nconcerns. Each level of the privilege-based access structure is affiliated with\nan access policy that is uniquely defined by specific attributes. Data is then\nencrypted under each access policy at every level to grant access to specific\ndata users based on their data access privileges. An individual ranked at a\ncertain level can decrypt the ciphertext (at that specific level) if and only\nif that individual owns a correct set of attributes that can satisfy the access\npolicy of that level. The user may also decrypt the ciphertexts at the lower\nlevels with respect to the user's level. Security analysis shows that P-MOD is\nsecure against adaptively chosen plaintext attack assuming the DBDH assumption\nholds.The comprehensive performance analysis demonstrates that P-MOD is more\nefficient in computational complexity and storage space than the existing\nschemes in secure data sharing within an organization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 20:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

While extremely robust to many\nenvironmental perturbations, these systems are vulnerable to noise with\nhigh-frequency components. Ironically, slower processes needed for adiabaticity\nallow more noise-induced excitations to accumulate, resulting in an\nantiadiabatic behavior that limits the precision of Majorana gates if some\nnoise is present. In a recent publication [Phys. Rev. B 96, 075158 (2017)],\nfast optimal protocols were proposed as a shortcut for implementing the same\nunitary operation as the adiabatic braiding. These shortcuts sacrifice\ntopological protection in the absence of noise but provide performance gains\nand remarkable robustness to noise due to the shorter evolution time.\nNevertheless, gates optimized for vanishing noise are suboptimal in the\npresence of noise. If we know the noise strength beforehand, can we design\nprotocols optimized for the existing unavoidable noise, which will effectively\ncorrect the noise-induced errors? We address this question in the present\npaper. We find such optimal protocols using simulated-annealing Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The numerically found pulse shapes, which we fully characterize,\nare in agreement with Pontryagin's minimum principle, which allows us to\narbitrarily improve the approximate numerical results (due to discretization\nand imperfect convergence) and obtain numerically exact optimal protocols. The\nprotocols are \\textit{bang-bang} (sequence of sudden quenches) for vanishing\nnoise, but contain continuous segments in the presence of multiplicative noise\ndue to the nonlinearity of the master equation governing the evolution. We find\nthat such noise-optimized protocols completely eliminate the above-mentioned\nantiadiabatic behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 00:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

The slopes of the abnormal Hall curves coincide with\nthe signs of SMR, confirming variational interface magnetism of Cr2O3 at\ndifferent temperature. From the observed SMR ratio under 3 T, the spin mixing\nconductance at Cr2O3/Ta interface is estimated to be 1.12*10^14 (ohm^-1*m^-2),\nwhich is comparable to that of YIG/Pt structures and our early results of\nCr2O3/W.

One emerging image editing technique is\ncolorization, which can colorize grayscale images with realistic colors.\nUnfortunately, this technique may also be intentionally applied to certain\nimages to confound object recognition algorithms. To the best of our knowledge,\nno forensic technique has yet been invented to identify whether an image is\ncolorized. We observed that, compared to natural images, colorized images,\nwhich are generated by three state-of-the-art methods, possess statistical\ndifferences for the hue and saturation channels. Besides, we also observe\nstatistical inconsistencies in the dark and bright channels, because the\ncolorization process will inevitably affect the dark and bright channel values.\nBased on our observations, i.e., potential traces in the hue, saturation, dark\nand bright channels, we propose two simple yet effective detection methods for\nfake colorized images: Histogram based Fake Colorized Image Detection\n(FCID-HIST) and Feature Encoding based Fake Colorized Image Detection\n(FCID-FE). Experimental results demonstrate that both proposed methods exhibit\na decent performance against multiple state-of-the-art colorization approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 02:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 13:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

This problem\narises in many algorithmic applications, perhaps most notably as a\npreconditioning step in solving a linear system of equations. One of the most\nnatural and by now classical approach to matrix scaling is the Sinkhorn-Knopp\nalgorithm (also known as the RAS method) where one alternately scales either\nall rows or all columns to meet the target values. In addition to being\nextremely simple and natural, another appeal of this procedure is that it\neasily lends itself to parallelization. A central question is to understand the\nrate of convergence of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm.\n  In this paper, we present an elementary convergence analysis for the\nSinkhorn-Knopp algorithm that improves upon the previous best bound. In a\nnutshell, our approach is to show a simple bound on the number of iterations\nneeded so that the KL-divergence between the current row-sums and the target\nrow-sums drops below a specified threshold $\\delta$, and then connect the\nKL-divergence with $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ distances.

This\ninequality may be of independent interest.\n  The idea of studying Sinkhorn-Knopp convergence via KL-divergence is not new\nand has indeed been previously explored.

To fill the gap, we\npropose an asymmetric design where IoT devices transmit uplink packets using\nthe lowest power while pushing all the decoding burdens to the AP side. Such a\ndesign utilizes the sufficient power and computational resources at AP to trade\nfor the transmission (TX) power of IoT devices.

The giant\ngravitons define the sites of this lattice and the open strings stretching\nbetween distinct giant gravitons define the hopping terms of the Hamiltonian.\nUsing the lattice boson model, we argue that the lowest energy giant graviton\nstates are obtained by distributing the momenta carried by the $X$ and $Y$\nfields evenly between the giants with the condition that any particular giant\ncarries only $X$ or $Y$ momenta, but not both.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 07:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

For both systematic\nand non-systematic polar codes, construction of them is based on an information\nset and the known frozen bits. Efficient implementation of systematic and\nnon-systematic polar codes exists. When it comes to channel estimation or\nchannel tracking, additional pilot symbols are inserted in the codeword\ntraditionally. In this paper, to improve the performance of polar codes in the\nfinite domain, pilot symbols are selected from the coded symbols themselves. In\norder to keep the existing efficient structure of polar code encoding, pilot\nselection is critical since not all selections can reuse the existing\nstructure. In this paper, two pilot selections denoted as Uneven Pilot\nSelection (UEPS) and Even Pilot Selection (EPS) are proposed, which do not\nchange the efficient polar encoding structure. The proposed UEPS and EPS is\nproven to satisfy the efficient construction condition. The performance of EPS\nis shown in this paper to outperform both the UEPS and the traditional pilot\ninsertion scheme. Simulation results are provided which verify the performance\nof the proposed pilot selection schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 10:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

The key idea of SLM is\nto jointly exploit spatial, in-phase, and quadrature dimensions to modulate\ninformation bits into a multi-dimensional signal set that consists oflattice\npoints. One major finding is that SLM achieves a higher spectral efficiency\nthan the existing spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing methods for the\nMIMO channel under the constraint ofM-ary pulseamplitude-modulation (PAM) input\nsignaling per dimension. In particular, it is shown that when the SLM signal\nset is constructed by using dense lattices, a significant signal-to-noise-ratio\n(SNR) gain, i.e., a nominal coding gain, is attainable compared to the existing\nmethods. In addition, closed-form expressions for both the average mutual\ninformation and average symbol-vector-error-probability (ASVEP) of generic SLM\nare derived under Rayleigh-fading environments. To reduce detection complexity,\na low-complexity detection method for SLM, which is referred to as lattice\nsphere decoding, is developed by exploiting lattice theory.

Recently,\nresearchers have achieved superresolution for two incoherent point sources with\nequal strengths using a new type of measurement technique, surpassing\nRayleigh's criterion. However, situations where more than two point sources\nneeded to be resolved have not been fully investigated. Here we prove that for\nany incoherent sources with arbitrary strengths, a one- or two-dimensional\nimage can be precisely resolved up to its second moment in the subdiffraction\nlimit, i.e. the Fisher information (FI) is non-zero. But the FI with respect to\nhigher order moments always tends to zero polynomially as the size of the image\ndecreases, for any type of non-adaptive measurement. We call this phenomenon a\nmodern description of Rayleigh's criterion. For PSFs under certain constraints,\nthe optimal measurement basis estimating all moments in the subdiffraction\nlimit for 1D weak-source imaging is constructed. Such basis also generates the\noptimal-scaling FI with respect to the size of the image for 2D or\nstrong-source imaging, which achieves an overall quadratic improvement compared\nto direct imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 12:35:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 16:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Traditional data augmentation techniques for image\nclassification tasks create new samples from the original training data by, for\nexample, flipping, distorting, adding a small amount of noise to, or cropping a\npatch from an original image. In this paper, we introduce a simple but\nsurprisingly effective data augmentation technique for image classification\ntasks. With our technique, named SamplePairing, we synthesize a new sample from\none image by overlaying another image randomly chosen from the training data\n(i.e., taking an average of two images for each pixel). By using two images\nrandomly selected from the training set, we can generate $N^2$ new samples from\n$N$ training samples. This simple data augmentation technique significantly\nimproved classification accuracy for all the tested datasets; for example, the\ntop-1 error rate was reduced from 33.5% to 29.0% for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset\nwith GoogLeNet and from 8.22% to 6.93% in the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also show\nthat our SamplePairing technique largely improved accuracy when the number of\nsamples in the training set was very small. Therefore, our technique is more\nvaluable for tasks with a limited amount of training data, such as medical\nimaging tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 13:37:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 13:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

Observed spectra were averaged over 1\nminute to increase photon statistics in weaker lines and the pre-flare spectrum\nwas subtracted. Synthetic line intensities for the kappa-distributions are\ncalculated using the KAPPA database. We find strong departures (kappa < 2)\nduring the early and impulsive phases of the flare, with subsequent\nthermalization of the flare plasma during the gradual phase. If the\ntemperatures are diagnosed from a single line ratio, the results are strongly\ndependent on the value of kappa. For kappa=2, we find temperatures about a\nfactor of two higher than the commonly used Maxwellian ones. The non-Maxwellian\neffects could also cause the temperatures diagnosed from line ratios and from\nthe ratio of GOES X-ray channels to be different. Multithermal analysis reveals\nthe plasma to be strongly multithermal at all times with flat DEMs. For lower\nkappa, the DEM_kappa are shifted towards higher temperatures. The only\nparameter that is nearly independent of kappa is electron density, where we\nfind log(N_e) $\\approx$ 11.5 almost independently of time.

In this sense, cluster analysis algorithms\nare a key element of exploratory data analysis, due to their easiness in the\nimplementation and relatively low computational cost. Among these algorithms,\nthe K -means algorithm stands out as the most popular approach, besides its\nhigh dependency on the initial conditions, as well as to the fact that it might\nnot scale well on massive datasets. In this article, we propose a recursive and\nparallel approximation to the K -means algorithm that scales well on both the\nnumber of instances and dimensionality of the problem, without affecting the\nquality of the approximation. In order to achieve this, instead of analyzing\nthe entire dataset, we work on small weighted sets of points that mostly intend\nto extract information from those regions where it is harder to determine the\ncorrect cluster assignment of the original instances. In addition to different\ntheoretical properties, which deduce the reasoning behind the algorithm,\nexperimental results indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nin terms of the trade-off between number of distance computations and the\nquality of the solution obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 14:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

A legitimate\nquestion is what information on the PSD can be reliably obtained from\nsingle-trajectory experiments, if one goes beyond the standard definition and\nanalyzes the PSD of a \\textit{single} trajectory recorded for a \\textit{finite}\nobservation time $T$. In quest for this answer, for a $d$-dimensional Brownian\nmotion we calculate the probability density function of a single-trajectory PSD\nfor arbitrary frequency $f$, finite observation time $T$ and arbitrary number\n$k$ of projections of the trajectory on different axes. We show analytically\nthat the scaling exponent for the frequency-dependence of the PSD specific to\nan ensemble of Brownian motion trajectories can be already obtained from a\nsingle trajectory, while the numerical amplitude in the relation between the\nensemble-averaged and single-trajectory PSDs is a fluctuating property which\nvaries from realization to realization.

It harbours a millisecond X-ray pulsar that is spinning at\n163 Hz and and has continuously been accreting from its companion star since\n2006. Determining the composition of the accreted matter in UCXBs is of high\ninterest for studies of binary evolution and thermonuclear burning on the\nsurface of neutron stars. Here, we present a multi-wavelength study of IGR\nJ17062-6143 aimed to determine the detailed properties of its accretion disc\nand companion star. The multi-epoch photometric UV to near-infrared spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) is consistent with an accretion disc\n$F_{\\nu}\\propto\\nu^{1/3}$. The SED modelling of the accretion disc allowed us\nto estimate an outer disc radius of $R_{out}=2.2^{+0.9}_{-0.4} \\times 10^{10}$\ncm and a mass-transfer rate of $\\dot{m}=1.8^{+1.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{-10}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Comparing this with the estimated mass-accretion rate\ninferred from its X-ray emission suggests that $\\gtrsim$90% of the transferred\nmass is lost from the system. Moreover, our SED modelling shows that the\nthermal emission component seen in the X-ray spectrum is highly unlikely from\nthe accretion disc and must therefore represent emission from the surface of\nthe neutron star. Our low-resolution optical spectrum revealed a blue continuum\nand no emission lines, i.e. lacking H and He features. Based on the current\ndata we cannot conclusively identify the nature of the companion star, but we\nmake recommendations for future study that can distinguish between the\ndifferent possible evolution histories of this X-ray binary. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how multiwavelength observations can be effectively used to find\nmore UCXBs among the LMXBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 15:41:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 17:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

In molecules composed of\nlow-Z elements, \\textit{K}-shell ionization creates a core-hole state in which\nthe main decay mode is an Auger process involving two electrons in the valence\nshell. After Auger decay, the nuclear wavepackets of the transient\ntwo-valence-hole states continue evolving on the femtosecond timescale, leading\neither to separated atomic ions or long-lived quasi-bound states. By using an\nx-ray pump and an x-ray probe pulse tuned above the \\textit{K}-shell ionization\nthreshold of the nitrogen molecule, we are able to observe ion dissociation in\nprogress by measuring the time-dependent kinetic energy releases of different\nbreakup channels. We simulated the measurements on N$_2$ with a molecular\ndynamics model that accounts for \\textit{K}-shell ionization, Auger decay, and\nthe time evolution of the nuclear wavepackets. In addition to explaining the\ntime-dependent feature in the measured kinetic energy release distributions\nfrom the dissociative states, the simulation also reveals the contributions of\nquasi-bound states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 15:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

For\nfaultless conversation sender and receiver of information must have the same\ndefinition of the domain (e.g. of language vocabulary). Up to now the\ndefinition of the domain and of its elements is derived from context and\nknowledge. The internet provides an additional important possibility: A link to\na conjoint uniform definition of the domain at unique location on the internet.\nThe associated basic information structure is called \"Domain Vector\" (DV) and\nhas the structure \"UL (of the domain definition) plus sequence of numbers\". The\n\"UL\" is not only \"Uniform Locator\" of the domain definition. It also identifies\na certain kind of information for later comparison and search. It can be a\nUniform Resource Locator (URL) or an abbreviated equivalent, e.g. a hierarchic\nnumeric pointer or a short local pointer to a table with global internet\npointers. The DV structure can be used as general carrier of information which\nis language independent and more precise than language. A domain which contains\nDVs is called \"Domain Space\" (DS) and is defined as metric space.

Experimental results\non two sets of audio data show that our algebraically-informed formulation\noutperforms tensor robust principal component analysis. We conclude with the\nmessage that an informed definition of the trace norm can bridge the gap\nbetween the hypercomplex and tensor-based approaches. Our approach can be seen\nas a general methodology for generating other principal component pursuit\nalgorithms with proper algebraic structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 00:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

To this end,\nhowever, the velocity of light in the interferometers cannot be the same\nparameter 'c' of Lorentz transformations. Thus, for the earth velocity of 370\nkm/s, a fundamental 10^(-15) light anisotropy, as presently observed in vacuum\nand in solid dielectrics, could reveal a 10^(-9) difference in the vacuum\nrefractivity between an ideal freely-falling frame and an apparatus on the\nearth surface. In this perspective, the stochastic nature of the vacuum could\nexplain the irregular character of the signal and the substantial reduction of\nits statistical average (10^(-18) or smaller). For the same v=370 km/s the\ndifferent refractivity, about 10^(-4) and 10^(-5) for air or helium at\natmospheric pressure, could also explain the observed anisotropy, respectively\nabout 10^(-10) and 10^(-11).

According to the LTE-U specification, if a LTE-U base station\ndetermines that a channel is vacant, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn\nOFF for only 1 ms, resulting in a duty cycle of 95%. In an area with heavy\nspectrum usage, there will be cases when a Wi-Fi access point wishes to share\nthe same channel, as it does today with Wi-Fi. We study, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, the effect that such a large LTE-U duty cycle can have on the\nassociation process, specifically Wi-Fi beacon transmission and reception. We\ndemonstrate via an experimental set-up using National Instrument (NI) USRPs\nthat a significant percentage of Wi-Fi beacons will either not be transmitted\nin a timely fashion or will not be received at the LTE-U BS thus making it\ndifficult for the LTE-U BS to adapt its duty cycle in response to the Wi-Fi\nusage.

We\ncompare the results with Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi coexistence and demonstrate that\nLTE-U/Wi-Fi coexistence is not fair when it comes to initial association since\nthere is a much larger percentage of beacon errors in the latter case.

The\nfrontiers of radiometric measurements with UAV require light and accurate\naltimeters flying at some 10 m from the ground. We equipped an aircraft with\nseven altimetric sensors (three low-cost GNSS receivers, one inertial\nmeasurement unit, one radar altimeter and two barometers) and analyzed $\\sim$ 3\nh of data collected over the sea in the (35-2194) m altitude range. At low\naltitudes (H $<$ 70 m) radar and barometric altimeters provide the best\nperformances, while GNSS data are used only for barometer calibration as they\nare affected by a large noise due to the multipath from the sea. The $\\sim$ 1 m\nmedian standard deviation at 50 m altitude affects the estimation of the ground\nradioisotope abundances with an uncertainty less than 1.3%. The GNSS\ndouble-difference post-processing enhanced significantly the data quality for H\n$>$ 80 m in terms of both altitude median standard deviation and agreement\nbetween the reconstructed and measured GPS antennas distances. Flying at 100 m\nthe estimated uncertainty on the ground total activity due to the uncertainty\non the flight height is of the order of 2%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 18:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

Then, we analyze a series of key problems concerning the training\nperformance and efficiency. Firstly, we train the 3D CNN model with data in\ndifferent resolutions and find out that models trained by high resolution input\ndata achieve better lung nodule proposals generation performances especially\nfor nodules in too small sizes, while consumes much more memory at the same\ntime. Then, we analyze the memory consumptions on different platforms and the\nexperimental results indicate that CPU architecture can provide us with larger\nmemory and enables us to explore more possibilities of 3D applications.

The two ensuing nonadiabatic ionization\nbursts have slightly different ionization amplitudes. This difference is due to\nredistribution of continuum electron energy during the bursts, negligible in\nstandard photo-ionization.

It is known\nthat for rational agents and bounded signals, there will not be asymptotic\nlearning.\n  Does it help if the agents can be cooperative rather than act selfishly? This\nis simple to achieve if the agents are allowed to use randomized protocols. In\nthis paper, we provide the first deterministic protocol under which asymptotic\nlearning occurs.
