Within stations, ventilation is among the top consuming\ndevices; it is operated at maximum airflow all day long, for air quality\nreasons. In this paper, we present a concept of energy system that displays\ncomparable air quality while consuming much less energy. The system comprises a\nbattery that makes it possible to recover the trains braking energy, arriving\nunder the form of erratic and strong peaks. We propose an energy management\nsystem (EMS) that, at short time scale, controls energy flows and ventilation\nairflow. By using proper optimization algorithms, we manage to match supply\nwith demand, while minimizing energy daily costs. For this purpose, we have\ndesigned algorithms that take into account the braking variability. They are\nbased on the so-called Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) mathematical\nframework. We fairly compare SDP based algorithms with the widespread Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) ones. First, both SDP and MPC yield energy/money\noperating savings of the order of one third, compared to the current management\nwithout battery (our figure does not include the cost of the battery). Second,\ndepending on the specific design, we observe that SDP outperforms MPC by a few\npercent, with an easier online numerical implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 16:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:17:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 12:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 09:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

In a similar way, we show that conjugate priors\nfor linear regression, which induce prior dependence, can lead to such\nunderestimation in the Bayesian high-dimensional regression setting.

Using free-standing slab models, we then demonstrate that reduced\nfilm thickness can also cause a MIT in CaVO$_3$, however, only for thicknesses\nof less than 4 perovskite units. Our calculations indicate that the MIT in such\nultra-thin films results mainly from a surface-induced crystal-field splitting\nbetween the $t_{2g}$-orbitals, favoring the formation of an orbitally-polarized\nMott insulator. This surface-induced crystal-field splitting is of the same\ntype as the one resulting from tensile epitaxial strain, and thus the two\neffects can also cooperate. Furthermore, our calculations confirm an\nenhancement of correlation effects at the film surface, resulting in a reduced\nquasiparticle spectral weight in the outermost layer, whereas bulk-like\nproperties are recovered within only a few layers away from the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 17:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

It was discussed in 1975 by\nAndreev and Bashkin, in the context of He$^3$/He$^4$ superfluid mixtures, that\ninter-particle interactions produce a dissipationless drag. The drag can be\nunderstood as a superflow of one component induced by phase gradients of the\nother component. Importantly the drag can be both positive (entrainment) and\nnegative (counter-flow). The effect is known to be of crucial importance for\nmany properties of diverse physical systems ranging from the dynamics of\nneutron stars, rotational responses of Bose mixtures of ultra-cold atoms to\nmagnetic responses of multicomponent superconductors. Although there exists a\nsubstantial literature that includes the drag interaction phenomenologically,\nmuch fewer regimes are covered by quantitative studies of the microscopic\norigin of the drag and its dependence on microscopic parameters. Here we study\nthe microscopic origin and strength of the drag interaction in a quantum system\nof two-component bosons on a lattice with short-range interaction. By\nperforming quantum Monte-Carlo simulations of a two-component Bose-Hubbard\nmodel we obtain dependencies of the drag strength on the boson-boson\ninteractions and properties of the optical lattice. Of particular interest are\nthe strongly-correlated regimes where the ratio of co-flow and counter-flow\nsuperfluid stiffnesses can diverge, corresponding to the case of saturated\ndrag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 17:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

We are now in an era in\nwhich anyone with a drone equipped with a video camera can use it to invade a\nsubject's privacy by streaming the subject in his/her private space over an\nencrypted first person view (FPV) channel. Although many methods have been\nsuggested to detect nearby drones, they all suffer from the same shortcoming:\nthey cannot identify exactly what is being captured, and therefore they fail to\ndistinguish between the legitimate use of a drone (for example, to use a drone\nto film a selfie from the air) and illegitimate use that invades someone's\nprivacy (when the same operator uses the drone to stream the view into the\nwindow of his neighbor's apartment), a distinction that in some cases depends\non the orientation of the drone's video camera rather than on the drone's\nlocation.

Sorting plays a significant role in remanufacturing\npre-processing inspections. Its significance can increase when remanufacturing\nfacilities encounter extreme situations, such as abnormally huge core arrivals.\nOur main objective in this work is switching from less efficient to a more\nefficient model and to characterize extreme behavior of core arrival in\nremanufacturing and applying the developed model to triage cores. Central\ntendency core flow models are not sufficient to handle extreme situations,\nhowever, complementary Extreme Value (EV) approaches have shown to improve\nmodel efficiency. Extreme core flows to remanufacturing facilities are rare but\nstill likely and can adversely affect remanufacturing business operations. In\nthis investigation, extreme end-of-use core flow is modelled by a threshold\napproach using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). It is shown that GPD\nhas better performance than its maxima-block GEV counterpart from practical and\ndata efficiency perspectives. The model is validated by a synthesized big\ndataset, tested by sophisticated statistical Anderson Darling (AD) test, and is\napplied to a case of extreme flow to a valve shop in order to predict\nprobability of over-capacity arrivals that is critical in remanufacturing\nbusiness management. Finally, the GPD model combined with triage strategies is\nused to initiate investigations into the efficacy of different triage methods\nin remanufacturing operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 17:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

We analyse the $^{12}$CO(1-0)-to-$^{13}$CO(1-0) ratio ($\\Re$) as a\nfunction of galactocentric radius and other parameters such as the\n$^{12}$CO(2-1)-to-$^{12}$CO(1-0) intensity ratio, the 70-to-160$\\mu$m flux\ndensity ratio, the star-formation rate surface density, the star-formation\nefficiency, and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor. We find that $\\Re$ varies by\na factor of 2 at most within and amongst galaxies, with a median value of 11\nand larger variations in the galaxy centres than in the discs. We argue that\noptical depth effects, most likely due to changes in the mixture of\ndiffuse/dense gas, are favored explanations for the observed $\\Re$ variations,\nwhile abundance changes may also be at play. We calculate a spatially-resolved\n$^{13}$CO(1-0)-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and find an average value of\n$1.0\\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K.km/s)$^{-1}$ over our sample with a standard\ndeviation of a factor of 2. We find that $^{13}$CO(1-0) does not appear to be a\ngood predictor of the bulk molecular gas mass in normal galaxy discs due to the\npresence of a large diffuse phase, but it may be a better tracer of the mass\nthan $^{12}$CO(1-0) in the galaxy centres where the fraction of dense gas is\nlarger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 19:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

Grasping smooth materials, for example, requires care,\nand softness is an ideal property for fabric used in bedding. Even when these\nproperties are not visual (e.g. softness is a physical property), we may still\ninfer their presence visually. We refer to such material properties as visual\nmaterial attributes. Recognizing these attributes in images can contribute\nvaluable information for general scene understanding and material recognition.\nUnlike well-known object and scene attributes, visual material attributes are\nlocal properties with no fixed shape or spatial extent. We show that given a\nset of images annotated with known material attributes, we may accurately\nrecognize the attributes from small local image patches. Obtaining such\nannotations in a consistent fashion at scale, however, is challenging. To\naddress this, we introduce a method that allows us to probe the human visual\nperception of materials by asking simple yes/no questions comparing pairs of\nimage patches. This provides sufficient weak supervision to build a set of\nattributes and associated classifiers that, while unnamed, serve the same\nfunction as the named attributes we use to describe materials. Doing so allows\nus to recognize visual material attributes without resorting to exhaustive\nmanual annotation of a fixed set of named attributes. Furthermore, we show that\nthis method may be integrated in the end-to-end learning of a material\nclassification CNN to simultaneously recognize materials and discover their\nvisual attributes. Our experimental results show that visual material\nattributes, whether named or automatically discovered, provide a useful\nintermediate representation for known material categories themselves as well as\na basis for transfer learning when recognizing previously-unseen categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 20:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

In these events, two consecutive CMEs are\nlaunched from the Sun in similar directions within an interval of time of a few\nhours. In our numerical model, we assume that the ambient solar wind is\ncharacterized by its velocity and mass-loss rate. Then, the CMEs are generated\nwhen the flow velocity and mass-loss rate suddenly change, with respect to the\nambient solar wind conditions during two intervals of time, which correspond to\nthe durations of the CMEs.

In this work,\nwe are interested in the general morphology of this merged region, which\ndepends on the initial parameters of the ambient solar wind and each of the\nCMEs involved.

However, one significant drawback of these\nmethods when they are applied to deep learning is that the magnitude of the\nupdate step is sometimes disproportionate to the magnitude of the weights (much\nsmaller or larger), leading to training instabilities such as vanishing and\nexploding gradients. An idea to combat this issue is gradient descent with\nproportional updates. Gradient descent with proportional updates was introduced\nin 2017. It was independently developed by You et al (Layer-wise Adaptive Rate\nScaling (LARS) algorithm) and by Abu-El-Haija (PercentDelta algorithm). The\nbasic idea of both of these algorithms is to make each step of the gradient\ndescent proportional to the current weight norm and independent of the gradient\nmagnitude. It is common in the context of new optimization methods to prove\nconvergence or derive regret bounds under the assumption of Lipschitz\ncontinuity and convexity. However, even though LARS and PercentDelta were shown\nto work well in practice, there is no theoretical analysis of the convergence\nproperties of these algorithms. Thus it is not clear if the idea of gradient\ndescent with proportional updates is used in the optimal way, or if it could be\nimproved by using a different norm or specific learning rate schedule, for\nexample. Moreover, it is not clear if these algorithms can be extended to other\nproblems, besides neural networks. We attempt to answer these questions by\nestablishing the theoretical analysis of gradient descent with proportional\nupdates, and verifying this analysis with empirical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 20:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

In decode-and-forward, the relay\ncompletely decodes the message and sends some information to the destination;\nin compress-and-forward, the relay does not decode, and it sends a compressed\nversion of the received signal to the destination using Wyner-Ziv coding. In\nthis paper, we present a novel coding paradigm that provides an improved\nachievable rate for the primitive relay channel. The idea is to combine\ncompress-and-forward and decode-and-forward via a chaining construction. We\ntransmit over pairs of blocks: in the first block, we use compress-and-forward;\nand in the second block, we use decode-and-forward. More specifically, in the\nfirst block, the relay does not decode, it compresses the received signal via\nWyner-Ziv, and it sends only part of the compression to the destination. In the\nsecond block, the relay completely decodes the message, it sends some\ninformation to the destination, and it also sends the remaining part of the\ncompression coming from the first block. By doing so, we are able to strictly\noutperform both compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward. Note that the\nproposed coding scheme can be implemented with polar codes. As such, it has the\ntypical attractive properties of polar coding schemes, namely, quasi-linear\nencoding and decoding complexity, and error probability that decays at\nsuper-polynomial speed. As a running example, we take into account the special\ncase of the erasure relay channel, and we provide a comparison between the\nrates achievable by our proposed scheme and the existing upper and lower\nbounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 22:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 08:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

In this context, the magnetic field is\ndragged by the collapsing gas, so its structure must reflect the flow that\ngenerates the filament. Around the filament, the gas is accreted onto it, and\nthe magnetic lines must then be perpendicular to the filament. As the gas\ndensity increases, the gas flow changes direction, becoming almost parallel to\nthe filament, and magnetic lines also tend to align with it. At the spine of\nthe filament, however, magnetic lines become perpendicular again since they\nmust connect to lines on the opposite side of the filament, resulting in\n\"U\"-shaped magnetic structures, which tend to be stretched by the longitudinal\nflow along the filament. Magnetic diffusive processes, however, allow the gas\nto continue to flow. Assuming a stationary state in which the ram pressure of\nthe flow balances the magnetic tension, the curvature of the field lines is\ndetermined by the diffusion rate. We derive an expression relating the\ncurvature of the field lines to the diffusive coefficient, which may be used to\nobservationally determine the nature of the diffusive process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 22:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Nonlinearities can\npreserve the compactness of flat band modes, along with renormalizing (tuning)\ntheir frequencies. These strictly compact nonlinear excitations induce tunable\nFano resonances in the wave propagation of a nonlinear flat band lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 01:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 07:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

In this paper, we add a model\nto the subject by considering a system where the state space consists of\nvarious orderings of a list. As in spin glasses, the disorder of such\n\"permutation glasses\" arises from a parameter in the Hamiltonian being drawn\nfrom a distribution of possible values, thus allowing nominally \"incorrect\norderings\" to have lower energies than \"correct orderings\" in the space of\npermutations. We analyze a Gaussian, uniform, and symmetric Bernoulli\ndistribution of energy costs, and, by employing Jensen's inequality, derive a\ngeneral condition requiring the permutation glass to always transition to the\ncorrectly ordered state at a temperature lower than that of the non-disordered\nsystem, provided that this correctly ordered state is accessible. We in turn\nfind that in order for the correctly ordered state to be accessible, the\nprobability that an incorrectly-ordered component is energetically favored must\nbe less than the inverse of the number of components in the system. We show\nthat all of these results are consistent with a replica symmetric ansatz of the\nsystem and argue that there is no permutation glass phase characterized by\nreplica symmetry breaking, but there is glassy behavior represented by a\nresidual entropy at zero temperature.

In particular, the framework performs linear operations in the\nring $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^l}$ using additively secret shared values and nonlinear\noperations using Yao's Garbled Circuits or the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson\nprotocol. Chameleon departs from the common assumption of additive or linear\nsecret sharing models where three or more parties need to communicate in the\nonline phase: the framework allows two parties with private inputs to\ncommunicate in the online phase under the assumption of a third node generating\ncorrelated randomness in an offline phase.

First,\nby the spin-polarized T-matrix fluctuation exchange approximation suitable for\nweakly and moderately correlated systems. Second, by the non-crossing\napproximation derived in the limit of weak hybridization (i.e. for strongly\ncorrelated systems) capturing Kondo-like processes.

Then, we turned to non\nspin-polarized calculations to avoid this unphysical behavior. By employing two\nplausible starting hybridization functions, it is observed that the\ncharacteristics of the resonance are crucially dependent on the starting point.\nIt appears that only one of these starting hybridizations could result in an\norbital Kondo resonance in the presence of a strong magnetic field like in the\nCr(001) surface.

Black holes seem like mystical objects, but they are\nan integral part of current astrophysics and are at the center of attempts to\nunify quantum physics and general relativity. Yet, nobody has ever seen a black\nhole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an\nacademic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.\nObservations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black\nhole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy\nemission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the\nevent horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which\ncould be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast\nto earlier pictures of black holes, that dark feature is not supposed to be due\nto a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative image of\nthe event horizon.

It being actively studied based on the convex\noptimization scheme such as nuclear-norm minimization. When given data tensors\ninclude some noises, the nuclear-norm minimization problem is usually converted\nto the nuclear-norm `regularization' problem which simultaneously minimize\npenalty and error terms with some trade-off parameter. However, the good value\nof trade-off is not easily determined because of the difference of two units\nand the data dependence. In the sense of trade-off tuning, the noisy tensor\ncompletion problem with the `noise inequality constraint' is better choice than\nthe `regularization' because the good noise threshold can be easily bounded\nwith noise standard deviation. In this study, we tackle to solve the convex\ntensor completion problems with two types of noise inequality constraints:\nGaussian and Laplace distributions. The contributions of this study are\nfollows: (1) New tensor completion and denoising models using tensor total\nvariation and nuclear-norm are proposed which can be characterized as a\ngeneralization/extension of many past matrix and tensor completion models, (2)\nproximal mappings for noise inequalities are derived which are analytically\ncomputable with low computational complexity, (3) convex optimization algorithm\nis proposed based on primal-dual splitting framework, (4) new step-size\nadaptation method is proposed to accelerate the optimization, and (5) extensive\nexperiments demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method for visual data\nretrieval such as for color images, movies, and 3D-volumetric data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 10:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

One of the generic implications of giving a mass to the graviton\nis that the gravitational potential will follow a Yukawa-like fall off.

For the origin of the twin peaks we discuss two\npossibilities: a single-jet model, based on added instabilities induced in j_1\nby the smaller companion BH on its inner orbital arc; and a two-jet model with\nthe smaller BH supporting its own, precessing jet j_2 that contributes lower,\nspecific GeV emissions. Such behaviors combining time stability with amplitude\nvariations betray plasma instabilities driven in either jet by binary dynamics,\nand can provide a double signature of the long-sought supermassive BH binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 12:18:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 15:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

In this direction, many sets of independent\nmeasurement campaigns show that wireless propagation at mmW carrier frequencies\nis only marginally worse than propagation at sub-6 GHz carrier frequencies for\nsmall-cell coverage --- one of the most important use-cases for 5G-NR. On the\nother hand, the biggest determinants of viability of mmW systems in practice\nare penetration and blockage of mmW signals through different materials in the\nscattering environment. With this background, the focus of this paper is on\nunderstanding the impact of blockage of mmW signals and reduced spatial\ncoverage due to penetration through the human hand, body, vehicles, etc.\nLeveraging measurements with a 28 GHz mmW experimental prototype and\nelectromagnetic simulation studies, we first propose statistical blockage\nmodels to capture the impact of the hand, human body and vehicles. We then\nstudy the time-scales at which mmW signals are disrupted by blockage (hand and\nhuman body). Our results show that these events can be attributed to physical\nmovements and the time-scales corresponding to blockage are hence on the order\nof a few 100 ms or more. Building on this fundamental understanding, we finally\nconsider the broader question of robustness of mmW beamforming to handle\nblockage. Network densification, subarray switching in a user equipment (UE)\ndesigned with multiple subarrays, fall back mechanisms such as codebook\nenhancements and switching to legacy carriers in non-standalone deployments,\netc. can address blockage before it leads to a deleterious impact on the mmW\nlink margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 12:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

In a grid-like topology, there are $a$ local constraints in every\ncolumn forming a column code, $b$ local constraints in every row forming a row\ncode, and $h$ global constraints in an $(m \\times n)$ grid of codeword.\nRecently, Gopalan et al. initiated the study of MRCs under grid-like topology,\nand derived a necessary and sufficient condition, termed as the regularity\ncondition, for an erasure pattern to be recoverable when $a=1, h=0$.\n  In this paper, we consider MRCs for product topology ($h=0$). First, we\nconstruct a certain bipartite graph based on the erasure pattern satisfying the\nregularity condition for product topology (any $a, b$, $h=0$) and show that\nthere exists a complete matching in this graph. We then present an alternate\ndirect proof of the sufficient condition when $a=1, h=0$. We later extend our\ntechnique to study the topology for $a=2, h=0$, and characterize a subset of\nrecoverable erasure patterns in that case.

For a free object we obtain a\nStueckelberg equation\n$\\frac{d}{d\\sigma}\\Psi(r_{4},\\sigma)=\\frac{ic^{2}\\hbar}{2\\langle\n\\epsilon\\rangle}\\Box\\Psi(r_{4},\\sigma)$, where $r_{4}=(r,ict)$. Here $\\sigma$\ndescribes the time $m$ passed between the start of the experiment at time $n$\nand the observation at time $n+m$. The parametrization is assumed to be\nnatural, meaning that $\\frac{d}{d\\sigma}\\langle t\\rangle=1$, where $\\langle\nt\\rangle$ is the expected temporal distance between the events that define $n$\nand $n+m$. The squared rest energy $\\epsilon_{0}^{2}$ is proportional to the\neigenvalue $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ that describes a 'stationary state'\n$\\Psi(r_{4},\\sigma)=\\psi(r_{4},\\tilde{\\sigma})e^{i\\tilde{\\sigma}\\sigma}$. The\nDirac equation follows as a `square root' of the stationary state equation from\nthe condition that $\\tilde{\\sigma}>0$, which follows from the directed nature\nof $n$. The formalism thus implies that all observable objects have non-zero\nrest mass, including elementary fermions. The introduction of $n$ releases $t$,\nso that it can be treated as an observable with uncertainty $\\Delta t$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 14:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 13:15:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 17:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 07:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

The linear functionals for separation of points can be\nselected in the form of the linear Fisher's discriminant.\n  All artificial intelligence systems make errors. Non-destructive correction\nrequires separation of the situations (samples) with errors from the samples\ncorresponding to correct behaviour by a simple and robust classifier.

In this article, we\npresent first steps towards implementing such a computational model into a\nsimulation tool which we call Phaseflow.\n  Phaseflow utilizes the finite element software FEniCS, which includes a\ndual-weighted residual method for goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement.\nPhaseflow is an open-source, dimension-independent implementation that, upon an\nappropriate parameter choice, reduces to classical benchmark situations\nincluding the lid-driven cavity and the Stefan problem. We present and discuss\nnumerical results for these, an octadecane PCM convection-coupled melting\nbenchmark, and a preliminary 3D convection-coupled melting example,\ndemonstrating the flexible implementation. Though being preliminary, the latter\nis, to our knowledge, the first published 3D result for this method. In our\nwork, we especially emphasize reproducibility and provide an easy-to-use\nportable software container using Docker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 15:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

The accuracy of the\nmarginals depends crucially on the quality of the submodular extension. To\nidentify the best possible extension, we show an equivalence between the\nsubmodular extensions of the energy and the objective functions of linear\nprogramming (LP) relaxations for the corresponding MAP estimation problem. This\nallows us to (i) establish the worst-case optimality of the submodular\nextension for Potts model used in the literature; (ii) identify the worst-case\noptimal submodular extension for the more general class of metric labeling; and\n(iii) efficiently compute the marginals for the widely used dense CRF model\nwith the help of a recently proposed Gaussian filtering method. Using synthetic\nand real data, we show that our approach provides comparable upper bounds on\nthe log-partition function to those obtained using tree-reweighted message\npassing (TRW) in cases where the latter is computationally feasible.\nImportantly, unlike TRW, our approach provides the first practical algorithm to\ncompute an upper bound on the dense CRF model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 14:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

However, within the field of\nelectromyography-based gesture recognition, deep learning algorithms are seldom\nemployed as they require an unreasonable amount of effort from a single person,\nto generate tens of thousands of examples.\n  This work's hypothesis is that general, informative features can be learned\nfrom the large amounts of data generated by aggregating the signals of multiple\nusers, thus reducing the recording burden while enhancing gesture recognition.\nConsequently, this paper proposes applying transfer learning on aggregated data\nfrom multiple users, while leveraging the capacity of deep learning algorithms\nto learn discriminant features from large datasets. Two datasets comprised of\n19 and 17 able-bodied participants respectively (the first one is employed for\npre-training) were recorded for this work, using the Myo Armband. A third Myo\nArmband dataset was taken from the NinaPro database and is comprised of 10\nable-bodied participants. Three different deep learning networks employing\nthree different modalities as input (raw EMG, Spectrograms and Continuous\nWavelet Transform (CWT)) are tested on the second and third dataset. The\nproposed transfer learning scheme is shown to systematically and significantly\nenhance the performance for all three networks on the two datasets, achieving\nan offline accuracy of 98.31% for 7 gestures over 17 participants for the\nCWT-based ConvNet and 68.98% for 18 gestures over 10 participants for the raw\nEMG-based ConvNet. Finally, a use-case study employing eight able-bodied\nparticipants suggests that real-time feedback allows users to adapt their\nmuscle activation strategy which reduces the degradation in accuracy normally\nexperienced over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 11:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 14:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 09:25:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 04:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

We expand the functionality of\nthe ANU code by introducing methods and software for analyzing images encoded\nin red, green, and blue (RGB), because this image encoding is very popular for\npublicly available data. Our methods allow the extraction of key topological\ninformation from RGB images via informative persistence diagrams by introducing\nnovel methods for transforming RGB-to-grayscale.

As such, core sorting holds a pivotal role in generalized\nremanufacturing operations, however, extreme value core arrivals, its\nstochastic nature and resulting sorting issues warrant targeted modelling and\nanalysis. This paper is devoted to triage as an agile and quality-based sorting\nstrategy in extreme value scenarios, which can be utilized as a complementary\ncore sorting strategy. A statistical model of extreme core arrivals is\ndeveloped based on Extreme Value (EV) theory and related Generalized Extreme\nValue (GEV) and Fr\\'echet (Fisher-Tippett type-II) distributions. The model is\napplied to extreme arrivals of valves in an industrial valve repair shop in\norder to formulate extreme arrival sorting strategies. Using a large sample\nsize, distribution parameters are estimated and the stochastic behaviour of the\nextreme valve arrivals is evaluated and verified. A generic analogy between\nmedical triage and remanufacturing triage is discussed, because triage can be\nused to address extreme core arrivals, associated statistical distributions,\nand their effect on core condition assessment in order to enhance management of\nunpredictable consequences of extreme core arrivals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 17:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}
