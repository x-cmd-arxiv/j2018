HOIPs represent a broad family of materials with\nproperties highly tuneable by the ions that make up the perovskite structure as\nwell as their multiple combinations. Interestingly, recent high-efficiency PV\ndevices using HOIPs with substantially improved long-term stability have used\ncombinations of different ionic compositions. The structural dynamics of these\nsystems are unique for semiconducting materials and are currently argued to be\ncentral to HOIPs stability and charge-transport properties.

Our results show that the acoustic phonon speeds\ncan be strongly modified by ionic composition, which we explain by analysing\nthe lead-halide sublattice in detail. The vibrational properties of HOIPs are\ntherefore tuneable by using targeted ionic compositions in the perovskite\nstructure. This tuning can be rationalized with non-trivial effects, for\nexample, considering the influence of the shape and dipole moment of organic\ncations. This has an important implication to further improvements in the\nstability and charge-transport properties of these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 16:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}

Their topological\nproperties are controlled by the band alignment of the two materials, as well\nas the electrostatic environment, which are currently not well understood.\nHere, we pursue to fill in this gap and address the role of band bending and\nsuperconductor-semiconductor hybridization in such devices by analyzing a gated\nsingle Al-InAs interface using a self-consistent Schrodinger-Poisson approach.\nOur numerical analysis shows that the band bending leads to an interface\nquantum well, which localizes the charge in the system near the\nsuperconductor-semiconductor interface. We investigate the hybrid band\nstructure and analyze its response to varying the gate voltage and thickness of\nthe Al layer. This is done by studying the hybridization degrees of the\nindividual subbands, which determine the induced pairing and effective\n$g$-factors. The numerical results are backed by approximate analytical\nexpressions which further clarify key aspects of the band structure. We find\nthat one can obtain states with strong superconductor-semiconductor\nhybridization at the Fermi energy, but this requires a fine balance of\nparameters, with the most important constraint being on the width of the Al\nlayer. In fact, in the regime of interest, we find an almost periodic\ndependence of the hybridization degree on the Al width, with a period roughly\nequal to the thickness of an Al monolayer. This implies that disorder and shape\nirregularities, present in realistic devices, may play an important role for\naveraging out this sensitivity and, thus, may be necessary for stabilizing the\ntopological phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 16:18:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 20:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 15:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

However, there is no satisfying physical explanation as to why\ncertain distribution forms preferentially occur instead of others.\nTheoretically, the analytical form of a PSD can be derived by directly solving\nthe general dynamic equation, but no analytical solutions have been found yet.\nInstead of a process level approach, the use of the principle of maximum\nentropy (MaxEnt) for determining the analytical form of PSDs from the\nperspective of system is examined here. MaxEnt theory states that the\nprobability density function with the largest information entropy among a group\nsatisfying the given properties of the variable should be chosen. Here, the\nissue of variability under coordinate transformations that arises using the\nGibbs/Shannon definition of entropy is identified, and the use of the concept\nof relative entropy to avoid these problems is discussed. Focusing on cloud\nphysics, the four-parameter generalized gamma distribution is proposed as the\nanalytical form of a PSD using the principle of maximum (relative) entropy with\nassumptions on power law relations between state variables, scale invariance\nand a further constraint on the expectation of one state variable (e.g. bulk\nwater mass). The four parameter generalized gamma distribution is very flexible\nto accommodate various type of constraints that could be assumed for cloud\nPSDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 17:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-11"}

This paper explores the\ntechniques available to determine temperatures from observations of single,\noptically thick molecular emission lines. Specific attention is given to issues\nsuch as inclusion of optically thin emission, problems resulting from continuum\nsubtraction, and complications of real observations. Effort is also made to\ndetail the exact nature and morphology of the region emitting a given line. To\nproperly study and quantify these effects, this paper considers a range of disk\nmodels, from simple pedagogical models, to very detailed models including full\nradiative transfer. Finally, we show how use of the wrong methods can lead to\npotentially severe misinterpretations of data, leading to incorrect\nmeasurements of disk temperature profiles. We show that the best way to\nestimate the temperature of emitting gas is to analyze the line peak emission\nmap without subtracting continuum emission. Continuum subtraction, which is\ncommonly applied to observations of line emission, systematically leads to\nunderestimation of the gas temperature. We further show that once observational\neffects such as beam dilution and noise are accounted for, the line brightness\ntemperature derived from the peak emission is reliably within 10-15% of the\nphysical temperature of the emitting region, assuming optically thick emission.\nThe methodology described in this paper will be applied in future works to\nconstrain the temperature, and related physical quantities, in protoplanetary\ndisks observed with ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 17:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Online search results are\nlists of items, wine menus are often lists of lists (grouped by type or\ncountry), and online shopping often involves filtering items which can be\nviewed as navigating a tree. Representations constrain how an agent can choose.\nAt the same time, an agent can also leverage representations when choosing,\nsimplifying his/her choice process. For instance, in the case of a list he or\nshe can use the order in which alternatives are represented to make his/her\nchoice.\n  In this paper, we model representations and decision procedures operating on\nthem.

Using this mapping, we can ask whether properties of\nchoice functions can be lifted onto the choice procedures which induce them. We\nfocus on the obvious benchmark: rational choice. We fully characterize choice\nprocedures which can be rationalized by a strict preference relation for\ngeneral representations including lists, list of lists, trees and others.

The accompanied\nphotospheric vector magnetic field changes are also analyzed using data from\nthe Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager.

The enhancing\npenumbral and shear flow regions are also accompanied by an increase of\nhorizontal field and decrease of magnetic inclination angle(measured from the\nsolar surface).

SEP propagation is influenced by turbulent\nmagnetic fields in the solar wind, resulting in stochastic transport of SEPs to\nEarth. Multi-spacecraft observations suggest that the cross-field propagation\nshapes the SEP fluxes at Earth strongly. However, modelling SEP cross-field\ntransport as spatial diffusion has been shown to be insufficient without use of\nunrealistically large cross-field diffusion coefficients. Recent work has shown\nthat the early-time propagation of energetic particles across the mean field\ndirection in turbulent fields is not diffusive, as the particles propagating\nalong meandering field lines. This early-time transport mode results in fast\naccess of the particles across the mean field direction, in agreement with the\nSEP observations. In this work, we demonstrate the significance of turbulence\nstrength on evolution of the SEP radiation environment near Earth. We calculate\nthe transport parameters with a turbulence transport model, parametrised by the\nSEP parallel scattering mean free path at 1~AU, $\\lambda_{\\parallel}^{*}$, and\nshow that the parallel and cross-field transport are connected, with conditions\nresulting in slow parallel transport corresponding to wider events.

We\npropose a novel secure retrospective interference alignment scheme in which the\ntransmitters carefully mix information symbols with artificial noises to ensure\nconfidentiality. Achieving positive secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) is\nchallenging due to the delayed nature of CSIT, and the distributed nature of\nthe transmitters. Our scheme works over two phases: phase one in which each\ntransmitter sends information symbols mixed with artificial noises, and repeats\nsuch transmission over multiple rounds. In the next phase, each transmitter\nuses delayed CSIT of the previous phase and sends a function of the net\ninterference and artificial noises (generated in previous phase), which is\nsimultaneously useful for all receivers.

We study stars with masses between 0.8 and\n3.0 $M_\\odot$, at evolutionary stages from zero-age main sequence to\nterminal-age main sequence, built using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar\nAstrophysics code. We show that most stars develop enhancements in nitrogen\n($^{14}$N) and depletions in carbon ($^{12}$C) and oxygen ($^{16}$O) over their\nlifetimes, and that these features are more pronounced for higher mass stars.\nWe find that, in an accretion-powered tidal disruption flare, these features\nbecome prominent only after the time of peak of the fallback rate and appear at\nearlier times for stars of increasing mass. We postulate that no severe\ncompositional changes resulting from the fallback material should be expected\nnear peak for a wide range of stellar masses and, as such, are unable to\nexplain the extreme helium-to-hydrogen line ratios observed in some TDEs.

Consequently, the development of planets\ndepends on formation environment. Here we present the first thorough\ninvestigation of tidally induced angular momentum loss in PPDs in the distant\nregime, partly motivated by claims in the literature for the importance of\ndistant encounters in disc evolution. We employ both theoretical predictions\nand dynamical/hydrodynamical simulations in 2D and 3D. Our theoretical analysis\nis based on that of Ostriker (1994) and leads us to conclude that in the limit\nthat the closest approach distance $x_{min} \\gg r$, the radius of a particle\nring, the fractional change in angular momentum scales as $(x_{min}/r)^{-5}$.\nThis asymptotic limit ensures that the cumulative effect of distant encounters\nis minor in terms of its influence on disc evolution. The angular momentum\ntransfer is dominated by the $m=2$ Lindblad resonance for closer encounters and\nby the $m=1$, $\\omega = 0$ Lindblad resonance at large $x_{min}/r$. We\ncontextualise these results by comparing expected angular momentum loss for the\nouter edge of a PPD due to distant and close encounters. Contrary to the\nsuggestions of previous works we do not find that distant encounters contribute\nsignificantly to angular momentum loss in PPDs. We define an upper limit for\nclosest approach distance where interactions are significant as a function of\narbitrary host to perturber mass ratio $M_2/M_1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

We have constructed an analytic model of a\njet bow shock driven into a surrounding slower disk wind in the thin shell\napproximation. The refilling of the post bow shock cavity from below by the\ndisk wind is also studied. An extension of the model to the case of two or more\nsuccessive internal working surfaces (IWS) is made.

This opens the possibility of bow shock\nchemical enrichment (if the disk wind is molecular and dusty) and of probing\nthe unperturbed disk wind structure near the jet base. Several distinctive\nsignatures of the presence of a surrounding disk wind are identified, in the\nbow shock morphology and kinematics.

Another four sources, two disks and two protostars, show\nmoderately-enhanced standard deviations in brightness, as expected for\nstochastic variables. For the two protostars, this apparent variability is the\nresult of single epochs that are much brighter than the mean. In our search for\nsecular brightness variations that are linear in time, we measure the\nfractional brightness change per year for 150 bright peaks, fifty of which are\nprotostellar. The ensemble distribution of slopes is well fit by a normal\ndistribution with sigma ~ 0.023. Most sources are not rapidly brightening or\nfading in the sub-mm. Comparison against time-randomized realizations shows\nthat the width of the distribution is dominated by the uncertainty in the\nindividual brightness measurements of the sources.

Many of the recently proposed access paradigms\nare enhancements to slotted ALOHA. One of the popular schemes, irregular\nrepetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA), is based on an analogy between multiple access\nwith successive interference cancellation and message-passing decoding on\nbipartite graphs. Most of the results on IRSA and its variants focus on the\ncollision channel and they ignore physical limitations such as transmit power\nconstraints and additive Gaussian noise at the physical layer. As such, naive\nextensions of IRSA to the Gaussian multiple access channel are not power\nefficient in the low signal-to-noise- ratio regime. This work introduces a\nnovel paradigm whereby devices adapt their rates and/or transmit powers based\non their chosen repetition profiles. The receiver performs maximal ratio\ncombining over all the replicas prior to decoding a message.

While rapid, these algorithms are plagued by\nbiases [4, 15, 24], and many researchers still frequently ignore or understate\nthese biases. In this paper, we examine sources of biases in particle\nlocalization. Rather than exhaustively examine all possible sources of bias, we\nillustrate their scale, the large number of sources, and the difficulty of\ncorrecting the biases with a heuristic method. We do this by generating a\nseries of simple images, introducing sources of bias one at a time. Using these\nimages, we examine the performance of two heuristic algorithms throughout the\nprocess: a centroid algorithm and a Gaussian fitting algorithm. We contrast the\ntwo heuristic methods with a new approach based on reconstructing an image with\na generative model to fit the data (Parameter Extraction from Reconstructing\nImages, or PERI). While the heuristic approaches produce considerable biases\neven on unrealistically simple images, the reconstruction-based approach\naccurately measures particle positions even in complex, highly realistic\nimages. We close by reiterating the fundamental reason that a\nreconstruction-based approach accurately extracts particle positions -- any\nimperfections in the fit both demonstrate which sources of systematic error are\nstill present and provide a roadmap to incorporating them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2018 23:12:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 21:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

The disc is inserted into the halo at a redshift z = 3 as a\nzero-mass rigid body. Its mass and size are then increased adiabatically while\nits position, velocity, and orientation are determined from rigid-body\ndynamics. At z = 1, the rigid disc is replaced by an N-body disc whose\nparticles sample a three-integral distribution function (DF). The simulation\nthen proceeds to z = 0 with live disc and halo particles. By comparison, other\nmethods assume one or more of the following: the centre of the rigid disc\nduring the growth phase is pinned to the minimum of the halo potential, the\norientation of the rigid disc is fixed, or the live N-body disc is constructed\nfrom a two rather than three-integral DF. In general, the presence of a disc\nmakes the halo rounder, more centrally concentrated, and smoother, especially\nin the innermost regions. We find that methods in which the disc is pinned to\nthe minimum of the halo potential tend to overestimate the amount of adiabatic\ncontraction. Additionally, the effect of the disc on the subhalo distribution\nappears to be rather insensitive to the disc insertion method. The live disc in\nour simulation develops a bar that is consistent with the bars seen in\nlate-type spiral galaxies.

We propose a model that couples epidemic\nspreading and resource diffusion in multiplex networks. The spread of disease\nin a physical contact layer and the recovery of the infected nodes are both\nstrongly dependent upon resources supplied by their counterparts in the social\nlayer. The generation and diffusion of resources in the social layer are in\nturn strongly dependent upon the state of the nodes in the physical contact\nlayer. Resources diffuse preferentially or randomly in this model. To quantify\nthe degree of preferential diffusion, a bias parameter that controls the\nresource diffusion is proposed. We conduct extensive simulations and find that\nthe preferential resource diffusion can change phase transition type of the\nfraction of infected nodes. When the degree of interlayer correlation is below\na critical value, increasing the bias parameter changes the phase transition\nfrom double continuous to single continuous. When the degree of interlayer\ncorrelation is above a critical value, the phase transition changes from\nmultiple continuous to first discontinuous and then to hybrid. We find\nhysteresis loops in the phase transition. We also find that there is an optimal\nresource strategy at each fixed degree of interlayer correlation where the\nthreshold reaches a maximum and under which the disease can be maximally\nsuppressed.

To address these two problems, we first accurately\napproximate the complicated effective bandwidth and transmit power in the\nlogarithm domain to formulate an energy minimization problem. By analyzing the\nformulation, we discover a critical transmission distance, defined as open\ndistance, and explicitly show that a relay should not be deployed if the\ntransmission distance is less than the open distance and should be otherwise.\nMost importantly, we derive a closed-form and easy-to-calculate expression for\nthe open distance and also strictly prove that the optimal placing position is\nat the middle point of the link when a relay should be introduced. Moreover,\nalthough this paper considers a linear two-hop relay network as the first step,\nour derived results can be applied to construct energy-efficient and\ndelay-friendly multi-hop networks. Simulation results validate our theoretical\nanalysis and show that properly introducing a relay can dramatically reduce the\nnetwork energy consumption almost without increasing the end-to-end delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 06:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

It is found that when the pipette\nradius or aspiration length is comparable to the elastocapillary length,\nsurface energy may distinctly alter the aspiration response. Generally, both\nthe aspiration length and the bulk normal stress decreases as surface energy\nincreases, and thus neglecting the surface energy will lead to an\noverestimation of elastic modulus.

Their execution may be accelerated by using\nmultidimensional index structures (MDIS), such as kd-trees or R-trees. As for\nmost index structures, the usefulness of this approach depends on the\nselectivity of the queries, and common wisdom told that a simple scan beats\nMDIS for queries accessing more than 15%-20% of a dataset. However, this wisdom\nis largely based on evaluations that are almost two decades old, performed on\ndata being held on disks, applying IO-optimized data structures, and using\nsingle-core systems. The question is whether this rule of thumb still holds\nwhen multidimensional range queries (MDRQ) are performed on modern\narchitectures with large main memories holding all data, multi-core CPUs and\ndata-parallel instruction sets. In this paper, we study the question whether\nand how much modern hardware influences the performance ratio between index\nstructures and scans for MDRQ. To this end, we conservatively adapted three\npopular MDIS, namely the R*-tree, the kd-tree, and the VA-file, to exploit\nfeatures of modern servers and compared their performance to different flavors\nof parallel scans using multiple (synthetic and real-world) analytical\nworkloads over multiple (synthetic and real-world) datasets of varying size,\ndimensionality, and skew.

A database benchmark must have a dataset D. To be\napplication-specific, this dataset D should be empirical. However, D may be too\nsmall, or too large, for the benchmarking experiments. D must, therefore, be\nscaled to the desired size.\n  To ensure the scaled D' is similar to D, previous work typically specifies or\nextracts a fixed set of features F = {F_1, F_2, . . . , F_n} from D, then uses\nF to generate synthetic data for D'. However, this approach (D -> F -> D')\nbecomes increasingly intractable as F gets larger, so a new solution is\nnecessary.\n  Different from existing approaches, this paper proposes ASPECT to scale D to\nenforce similarity. ASPECT first uses a size-scaler (S0) to scale D to D'. Then\nthe user selects a set of desired features F'_1, . . . , F'_n. For each desired\nfeature F'_k, there is a tweaking tool T_k that tweaks D' to make sure D' has\nthe required feature F'_k. ASPECT coordinates the tweaking of T_1,...,T_n to\nD', so T_n(...(T_1(D'))...) has the required features F'_1,...,F'_n.\n  By shifting from D -> F -> D' to D -> D' -> F', data scaling becomes\nflexible.

In this paper, we study the energy-efficient resource-management\npolicy for the asynchronous MECO system, where the mobiles have heterogeneous\ninput-data arrival time instants and computation deadlines. First, we consider\nthe general case with arbitrary arrival-deadline orders. Based on the monomial\nenergy-consumption model for data transmission, an optimization problem is\nformulated to minimize the total mobile-energy consumption under the\ntime-sharing and computation-deadline constraints. The optimal\nresource-management policy for data partitioning (for offloading and local\ncomputing) and time division (for transmissions) is shown to be computed by\nusing the block coordinate decent method. To gain further insights, we study\nthe optimal resource-management design for two special cases. First, consider\nthe case of identical arrival-deadline orders, i.e., a mobile with input data\narriving earlier also needs to complete computation earlier. The optimization\nproblem is reduced to two sequential problems corresponding to the optimal\nscheduling order and joint data-partitioning and time-division given the\noptimal order. It is found that the optimal time-division policy tends to\nbalance the defined effective computing power among offloading mobiles via time\nsharing. Furthermore, this solution approach is extended to the case of reverse\narrival-deadline orders. The corresponding time-division policy is derived by a\nproposed transformation-and-scheduling approach, which first determines the\ntotal offloading duration and data size for each mobile in the transformation\nphase and then specifies the offloading intervals for each mobile in the\nscheduling phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 08:47:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2018 13:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 13:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Two scenarios are investigated: Case 1,\nhow a two-level system changes the pulse shapes of two input photons\npropagating in a single input channel; and Case 2, how a two-level system\nresponds to two counter-propagating photons. By means of a transfer function\napproach, the steady-state output field states for both cases are derived\nanalytically. In Example 1, a two-photon input state of Gaussian pulse shape is\nused to excite a two-level atom. The simulation demonstrates that in the time\ndomain the atom tends to stretch out the two photons. Moreover, the striking\ndifference between the joint probability distribution of the output two-photon\nstate and that of the input two-photon state occurs exactly under the setting\nwhen the two-level atom is most efficiently excited. In Example 2, a two-photon\ninput state of rising exponential pulse shape is used to excite a two-level\natom. Strong anti-correlation of the output two-photon state is observed, which\nis absent in Example 1 for the Gaussian pulse shape. Such difference indicates\nthat different pulse shapes give rise to drastically different frequency\nentanglement of the output two-photon state. Example 3 is used to illustrate\nCase 2, where two counter-propagating single photons of rising exponential\npulse shapes are input to a two-level atom. The frequency-dependent\nHong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference phenomenon is observed. The simulation\nresults base on the analytic forms of output two-photon states are consistent\nwith those based on quantum master or filter equations [43,11]. Similar\nphysical phenomena have been observed in physical settings such as cavity\nopto-mechanical systems and Keer nonlinear cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 09:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 02:30:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 04:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

An essential question related\nto these phenomena concerns the estimation of the (time-evolving) melting rate,\nwhich is tightly connected to the turbulent convective dynamics in the bulk of\nthe melt fluid and the heat transfer at the liquid-solid interface. In this\nwork, we consider a convective-melting model, constructed as a generalization\nof the Rayleigh-B\\'enard system, accounting for the basal melting of a solid.\nAs the change of phase proceeds, a fluid layer grows at the heated bottom of\nthe system and eventually reaches a turbulent convection state. By means of\nextensive Lattice-Boltzmann numerical simulations employing an enthalpy\nformulation of the governing equations, we explore the model dynamics in two\nand three-dimensional configurations. The focus of the analysis is on the\nscaling of global quantities like the heat flux and the kinetic energy with the\nRayleigh number, as well as on the interface morphology and the effects of\nspace dimensionality. Independently of dimensionality, we find that the\nconvective-melting system behavior shares strong resemblances with that of the\nRayleigh-B\\'enard one, and that the heat flux is only weakly enhanced with\nrespect to that case. Such similarities are understood, at least to some\nextent, considering the resulting slow motion of the melting front (with\nrespect to the turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations) and its generally little\nroughness (compared to the height of the fluid layer). Varying the Stefan\nnumber, accounting for the thermodynamical properties of the material, also\nseems to have only a mild effect, which implies the possibility to extrapolate\nresults in numerically delicate low-Stefan setups from more convenient\nhigh-Stefan ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 10:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 14:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 May 2018 09:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

One distinguished player, the\nleader, may alter the weights of the items in a given subset $L\\subset N$, and\na second player, the follower, selects a solution $A\\subseteq N$ in order to\nutilize a bounded resource in the best possible way. Finally, the leader\nreceives a payoff from those items of its subset $L$ that were included in the\noverall solution $A$, chosen by the follower. We assume that the follower\napplies a publicly known, simple, heuristic algorithm to determine its solution\nset, which avoids having to solve NP-hard problems.\n  Two variants of the problem are considered, depending on whether the leader\nis able to control (i.e., change) the weights of its items (i) in the objective\nfunction or (ii) in the bounded resource constraint. The leader's objective is\nthe maximization of the overall weight reduction, for the first variant, or the\nmaximization of the weight increase for the latter one. In both variants there\nis a trade-off for each item between the contribution value to the leader's\nobjective and the chance of being included in the follower's solution set.\n  We analyze the leader's pricing problem for a natural greedy strategy of the\nfollower and discuss the complexity of the corresponding problems. We show that\nsetting the optimal weight values for the leader is, in general, NP-hard. It is\neven NP-hard to provide a solution within a constant factor of the best\npossible solution. Exact algorithms, based on dynamic programming and running\nin pseudopolynomial time, are provided. The additional cases, in which the\nfollower faces a continuous (linear relaxation) version of the above problems,\nare shown to be straightforward to solve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 10:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

In a massive MIMO system, the communication between each BS with\n$M \\gg 1$ antennas and each single-antenna user occurs through a collection of\nscatterers in the environment, where the channel vector of each user at BS\nantennas consists in a weighted linear combination of the array responses of\nthe scatterers, where each scatterer has its own angle of arrival (AoA) and\ncomplex channel gain. The array response at a given AoA depends on the\nwavelength of the incoming planar wave and is naturally frequency dependent.\nThis results in a frequency-dependent distortion where the second order\nstatistics, i.e., the covariance matrix, of the channel vectors varies with\nfrequency. In this paper, we show that although this effect is generally\nnegligible for a small number of antennas $M$, it results in a considerable\ndistortion of the covariance matrix and especially its dominant signal subspace\nin the massive MIMO regime where $M \\to \\infty$, and can generally incur a\nserious degradation of the performance especially in frequency division\nduplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems where the uplink (UL) and the downlink\n(DL) communication occur over different frequency bands. We propose a novel\nUL-DL covariance interpolation technique that is able to recover the covariance\nmatrix in the DL from an estimate of the covariance matrix in the UL under a\nmild reciprocity condition on the angular power spread function (PSF) of the\nusers. We analyze the performance of our proposed scheme mathematically and\nprove its robustness under a sufficiently large spatial oversampling of the\narray. We also propose several simple off-the-shelf algorithms for UL-DL\ncovariance interpolation and evaluate their performance via numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 11:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

To this end,\nnetworks that employ current radios usually deal with self-interference and\nmulti-user interference by beamforming techniques. Although previous works\ninvestigated beamforming design to improve spectral efficiency, the fundamental\nquestion of how to split the antennas at a base station between uplink and\ndownlink in full-duplex networks has not been investigated rigorously. This\npaper addresses this question by posing antenna splitting as a binary nonlinear\noptimization problem to minimize the sum mean squared error of the received\ndata symbols. It is shown that this is an NP-hard problem. This combinatorial\nproblem is dealt with by equivalent formulations, iterative convex\napproximations, and a binary relaxation. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed\nto converge to a stationary solution of the relaxed problem with much smaller\ncomplexity than exhaustive search. Numerical results indicate that the proposed\nsolution is close to the optimal in both high and low self-interference capable\nscenarios, while the usually assumed antenna splitting is far from optimal. For\nlarge number of antennas, a simple antenna splitting is close to the proposed\nsolution. This reveals that the importance of antenna splitting is inversely\nproportional with the number of antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 11:27:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 20:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

Exploiting\nthe depth and completeness ($98\\,$per cent at $r<19.8\\,$mag) of the Galaxy And\nMass Assembly survey (GAMA), we probe down the group halo mass function to\nassess whether AGN are found in the same regions in groups as they are in\nclusters. We select 451 optical AGN from 7498 galaxies with\n$\\log_{10}(M_*/\\text{M}_\\odot) > 9.9$ in 695 groups with $11.53\\leq\n\\log_{10}(M_{200}/\\text{M}_\\odot) \\leq 14.56$ at $z<0.15$. By analysing the\nprojected phase-space positions of these galaxies we demonstrate that when\nsplit both radially, and into physically derived infalling and core\npopulations, AGN position within group projected phase-space is dependent on\nhalo mass. For groups with $\\log_{10}(M_{200}/\\text{M}_\\odot)>13.5$, AGN are\npreferentially found in the infalling galaxy population with $3.6\\sigma$\nconfidence. At lower halo masses we observe no difference in AGN fraction\nbetween core and infalling galaxies. These observations support a model where a\nreduced number of low-speed interactions, ram pressure stripping and\nintra-group/cluster medium temperature, the dominance of which increase with\nhalo mass, work to inhibit AGN in the cores of groups and clusters with\n$\\log_{10}(M_{200}/\\text{M}_\\odot)>13.5$, but do not significantly affect\nnuclear activity in cores of less massive structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 11:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

The aim is to maximize the end to\nend secrecy rate with optimal power allocation over different sub-carriers.\nLater, we consider a more general multi-user multi-relay scenario.

Some basin-forming impacts occurred 3.9-3.7Gy ago. Many other\nbasins formed before, but their exact ages are not precisely known. There are\ntwo possible interpretations of the data: in the cataclysm scenario there was a\nsurge in the impact rate approximately 3.9Gy ago, while in the accretion tail\nscenario the lunar bombardment declined since the era of planet formation and\nthe latest basins formed in its tail-end. Here, we revisit the work of\nMorbidelli et al.(2012) that examined which scenario could be compatible with\nboth the lunar crater record in the 3-4Gy period and the abundance of highly\nsiderophile elements (HSE) in the lunar mantle. We use updated numerical\nsimulations of the fluxes of impactors. Under the traditional assumption that\nthe HSEs track the total amount of material accreted by the Moon since its\nformation, we conclude that only the cataclysm scenario can explain the data.\nThe cataclysm should have started ~3.95Gy ago. However we show that HSEs could\nhave been sequestered from the lunar mantle due to iron sulfide exsolution\nduring magma ocean crystallization, followed by mantle overturn. Based on the\nhypothesis that the lunar magma ocean crystallized about 100-150My after Moon\nformation, and therefore that HSEs accumulated in the lunar mantle only after\nthis time, we show that the bombardment in the 3-4Gy period can be explained in\nthe accretion tail scenario. This hypothesis would also explain why the Moon\nappears so depleted in HSEs relative to the Earth. We also extend our analysis\nof the cataclysm and accretion tail scenarios to the case of Mars. The\naccretion tail scenario requires a global resurfacing event on Mars ~4.4Gy ago,\npossibly associated with the formation of the Borealis basin, and it is\nconsistent with the HSE budget of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 13:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

The high resolution soft X-ray spectrum,\nwith a total exposure exceeding 600 ks, shows a series of blue-shifted\nabsorption lines, from the He and H-like transitions of N, O and Ne, as well as\nfrom L-shell Fe.

This motivates the cycle constraint which says that a battery must\nbe charged (discharged) only after it is sufficiently discharged (charged).

In this\ncontext, we study EH communication systems with: (a) a single-battery with\ncapacity 2B units and (b) dual-batteries, each having capacity of B units.

One\nof the main results of this paper describes the connectivity properties of\nthese loops. Roughly, we show that all the loops are disjoint if $a+b \\geq\n4\\lambda$, and that their intersection graph is connected if $a + b <\n4\\lambda$.

Unfortunately, even the well established standard\nmultiplexing techniques employed to generate photons with fixed spectral\nproperties are affected by the detrimental effects of losses, spectral\ndistorsions and reduction in purity.

Depending on the parameters in the reduced system, one\ncan observe different types of motion, including those accompanied by strange\nattractors leading to a chaotic (diffusion) trajectory of the sleigh on the\nplane. The problem of unbounded acceleration (an analog of Fermi acceleration)\nof the sleigh is examined in detail.
