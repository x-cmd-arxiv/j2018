The presented approach for approximating the DOS is based on\ntwo main techniques. First, we propose an economical method for calculating the\ntraces of parametric matrix resolvents at interpolation points by taking\nadvantage of the block-diagonal plus low-rank matrix structure described in [6,\n3] for the BSE/TDA problem. Second, we show that a regularized or smoothed DOS\ndiscretized on a fine grid of size $N$ can be accurately represented by a low\nrank quantized tensor train (QTT) tensor that can be determined through a least\nsquares fitting procedure. The latter provides good approximation properties\nfor strictly oscillating DOS functions with multiple gaps, and requires\nasymptotically much fewer ($O(\\log N)$) functional calls compared with the full\ngrid size $N$. This approach allows us to overcome the computational\ndifficulties of the traditional schemes by avoiding both the need of stochastic\nsampling and interpolation by problem independent functions like polynomials\netc. Numerical tests indicate that the QTT approach yields accurate recovery of\nDOS associated with problems that contain relatively large spectral gaps.

We define the utility of each user as the sum of two sub-utility\nfunctions: (i) the difference between the total payment received by the user\nand the total transmission rate of the user, and (ii) the difference between\nthe total number of required packets by the user and the total payment made by\nthe user.

The encoding is performed\nin such a way that each client can retrieve its demanded message from its side\ninformation and the broadcast codeword. In general, in order to decode its\ndemanded message symbol, a receiver may have to observe the entire transmitted\ncodeword. Querying or downloading the codeword symbols might involve costs to a\nclient -- such as network utilization costs and storage requirements for the\nqueried symbols to perform decoding. In traditional index coding solutions,\nthis 'client aware' perspective is not considered during code design. As a\nresult, for these codes, the number of codeword symbols queried by a client per\ndecoded message symbol, which we refer to as 'locality', could be large. In\nthis paper, considering locality as a cost parameter, we view index coding as a\ntrade-off between the achievable broadcast rate (codeword length normalized by\nthe message length) and locality, where the objective is to minimize the\nbroadcast rate for a given value of locality and vice versa. We show that the\nsmallest possible locality for any index coding problem is 1, and that the\noptimal index coding solution with locality 1 is the coding scheme based on\nfractional coloring of the interference graph. We propose index coding schemes\nwith small locality by covering the side information graph using acyclic\nsubgraphs and subgraphs with small minrank. We also show how locality can be\naccounted for in conventional partition multicast and cycle covering solutions\nto index coding. Finally, applying these new techniques, we characterize the\nlocality-broadcast rate trade-off of the index coding problem whose side\ninformation graph is the directed 3-cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-12"}

When the number of features\n$p$ is large (perhaps even larger than the sample size $n$), and we have no\nprior knowledge regarding the type of dependence between $Y$ and $X$, the\nmodel-X knockoffs framework nonetheless allows us to select a model with a\nguaranteed bound on the false discovery rate, as long as the distribution of\nthe feature vector $X=(X_1,\\dots,X_p)$ is exactly known.

The intrinsic hybrid spin reveals the complex\nspin essence in elastic waves and advances our understanding about their\nfundamental topological properties. We also show these spin-dependent phenomena\ncan be exploited to control the wave propagation, such as non-symmetric elastic\nwave excitation by spin pairs, uni-directional Rayleigh wave and spin-selected\nelastic wave routing. These findings are generally applicable for arbitrary\nwaves with longitudinal and transverse components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

This is achieved\nby selection of T cells in the thymus, where immature T cells expressing\nunique, stochastically generated TCRs interact with a large number of\nself-peptide-MHC; if a TCR does not bind strongly enough to any\nself-peptide-MHC, or too strongly with at least one self-peptide-MHC, the T\ncell dies.

Kinematics measurements of these stars have revealed a stellar disk\nstructure (with an apparent 20% disk membership) that has provided important\nclues to the origin of these mysterious young stars. However many of the\napparent disk properties are difficult to explain, including the low disk\nmembership fraction and the high eccentricities, given the youth of this\npopulation. Thus far, all efforts to derive the properties of this disk have\nmade the simplifying assumption that stars at the GC are single stars.\nNevertheless, stellar binaries are prevalent in our Galaxy, and recent\ninvestigations suggested that they may also be abundant in the Galactic Center.\nHere we show that binaries in the disk can largely alter the apparent orbital\nproperties of the disk. The motion of binary members around each other adds a\nvelocity component, which can be comparable to the magnitude of the velocity\naround the SMBH in the GC. Thus neglecting the contribution of binaries can\nsignificantly vary the inferred stars' orbital properties. While the disk\norientation is unaffected the apparent disk's 2D width is increased to about\n11.2deg, similar to the observed width. For a population of stars orbiting the\nSMBH with zero eccentricity, unaccounted for binaries will create a wide\napparent eccentricity distribution with an average of 0.23.This is consistent\nwith the observed average eccentricity of the stars' in the disk. We suggest\nthat this high eccentricity value, which poses a theoretical challenge, may be\nan artifact of binary stars. Finally our results suggest that the actual disk\nmembership might be significantly higher than the one inferred by observations\nthat ignore the contribution of binaries, alleviating another theoretical\nchallenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Non-detections can be attributed to rapid molecular\nphotodissociation due to the A-star's strong UV flux. CN is the longest-lasting\nand most easily detectable molecule after CO in this environment. We update our\nNLTE excitation model to include UV fluorescence, finding it plays a key role\nin CO and CN excitation, and use it to turn the SMA CN/CO flux ratio constraint\ninto an upper limit of $<2.5$% on the HCN/(CO+CO$_2$) ratio of outgassing\nrates. This value is consistent with, but at the low end of, the broad range\nobserved in Solar System comets. If sublimation dominates outgassing, then this\nlow value may be caused by decreased outgassing for the less volatile molecule\nHCN compared to CO. If instead UV photodesorption or collisional vaporization\nof unbound grains dominates outgassing, then this low ratio of rates would\nimply a low ice abundance ratio, which would in turn indicate a variation in\ncometary cyanide abundances across planetary systems. To conclude, we make\npredictions for future molecular surveys and show that CN and HCN should be\nreadily detectable with ALMA around $\\beta$ Pictoris for Solar-System-like\nexocometary compositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

The\ngalaxy, at a redshift of 0.26, is associated with a radio source of\nflat/inverted spectrum at high radio frequencies. The analysis of its optical\nspectrum obtained in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) revealed a small\nlinewidth of the broad component of the H{\\beta} line (full width at\nhalf-maximum = 1585 km s^{-1}), making it a radio-loud NLS1 galaxy -- an\nintriguing class of active galactic nuclei with exceptional multiwavelength\nproperties.

In this paper, the timeliness of the status\nis measured by the recently proposed age-of-information (AoI) metric; both the\ntheoretical and practical aspects of the problem are investigated: we aim to\nobtain a scheduling policy with minimum AoI and, meanwhile, still suitable for\ndecentralized implementation on account of signalling exchange overhead.\nTowards this end, we first consider the set of arrival-independent and renewal\n(AIR) policies; the optimal policy thereof to minimize the time-average AoI is\nproved to be a round-robin policy with one-packet (latest packet only and\nothers are dropped) buffers (RR-ONE). The optimality is established based on a\ngeneralized Poisson-arrival-see-time-average (PASTA) theorem. It is further\nproved that RR-ONE is asymptotically optimal among all policies in the massive\nIoT regime. The AoI steady-state stationary distribution under RR-ONE is also\nderived. A fully decentralized implementation of RR-ONE is proposed which can\naccommodate dynamic terminal appearances. In addition, considering scenarios\nwhere packets cannot be dropped, the optimal AIR policy thereof is also found\nwith parameters given by the solution to a convex problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 20:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-15"}

We\nfind that by altering the model such that Eve's copy of the initial round of\nfeedback is corrupted by an iota of noise, one step towards physical relevance,\nthe capacity can be increased dramatically. It is known that the private\ncapacity with respect to the original model for a pure-loss bosonic channel is\nat most $- \\log(1-\\eta)$ bits per mode, where $\\eta$ is the transmissivity, in\nthe limit of infinite input photon number. This is a very pessimistic result as\nthere is a finite rate limit even with an arbitrarily large number of input\nphotons. We refer to this as a loss limited rate. However, in our altered model\nwe find that we can achieve a rate of $(1/2) \\log(1 + 4 \\eta N_S)$ bits per\nmode, where $N_S$ is the input photon number. This rate diverges with $N_S$, in\nsharp contrast to the result for the original model. This suggests that\nphysical considerations behind the eavesdropping model should be taken more\nseriously, as they can create strong dependencies of the achievable rates on\nthe model. For by a seemingly inconsequential weakening of Eve, we obtain a\nloss-unlimited rate. Our protocol also works verbatim for arbitrary i.i.d.\nnoise (not even necessarily Gaussian) injected by Eve in every round, and even\nif Eve is given access to copies of the initial transmission and noise. The\nerror probability of the protocol decays super-exponentially with the\nblocklength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 21:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

These proxies, based on X-ray emission, typically require expensive,\nhigh-quality X-ray observations making them difficult to apply to large surveys\nof groups and clusters. Here, we compare optical relaxation proxies with X-ray\nasymmetries and centroid shifts for a sample of SDSS clusters with\nhigh-quality, archival X-ray data from Chandra and XMM-Newton. The three\noptical relaxation measures considered are: the shape of the member-galaxy\nprojected velocity distribution -- measured by the Anderson-Darling (AD)\nstatistic, the stellar mass gap between the most-massive and\nsecond-most-massive cluster galaxy, and the offset between the most-massive\ngalaxy (MMG) position and the luminosity-weighted cluster centre. The AD\nstatistic and stellar mass gap correlate significantly with X-ray relaxation\nproxies, with the AD statistic being the stronger correlator. Conversely, we\nfind no evidence for a correlation between X-ray asymmetry or centroid shift\nand the MMG offset. High-mass clusters ($M_\\mathrm{halo} >\n10^{14.5}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) in this sample have X-ray asymmetries, centroid\nshifts, and Anderson-Darling statistics which are systematically larger than\nfor low-mass systems. Finally, considering the dichotomy of Gaussian and\nnon-Gaussian clusters (measured by the AD test), we show that the probability\nof being a non-Gaussian cluster correlates significantly with X-ray asymmetry\nbut only shows a marginal correlation with centroid shift. These results\nconfirm the shape of the radial velocity distribution as a useful proxy for\ncluster relaxation, which can then be applied to large redshift surveys lacking\nextensive X-ray coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 21:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

This behavior results from the simultaneous contraction of the\nunit cell volume, which tunes the relative strengths of the Kondo and RKKY\ninteractions, and the introduction of disorder through alloying. Near the\ncritical region at $x_{\\rm{cr}}$ $\\approx$ 0.7, the rate of contraction of the\nunit cell volume strengthens, indicating that the cerium $f$-valence crosses\nover from trivalent to a non-integer value.

Recent progress\non these progenitor models is discussed, including the initial parameter space\nfor producing SNe Ia, the binary evolutionary paths to SNe Ia, the progenitor\ncandidates of SNe Ia, the possible surviving companion stars of SNe Ia, and\nsome observational constraints, etc. Some other potential progenitor models of\nSNe Ia are also summarized, including the hybrid CONe WD model, the\ncore-degenerate model, the double WD collision model, the spin-up/spin-down\nmodel, and the model of WDs near black holes.To date, it seems that two or more\nprogenitor models are needed to explain the observed diversity among SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 01:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 13:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

While resource\nsharing across multiple service providers can be a way to maximize the\nutilization of limited resources at the network edge, it requires a centralized\nrepository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status.\nMoreover, service providers have to trust each other for resource allocation\nfairness, which is difficult because of potential conflicts of interest.

The individual worker nodes iteratively\nupdate their estimate of the parameter by assimilating latest locally sensed\ninformation and estimates from neighboring worker nodes exchanged over a\n(possibly sparse) time-varying communication graph. The underlying inter-worker\ncommunication protocol is adaptive, making communications increasingly\n(probabilistically) sparse as time progresses. Under minimal conditions on the\ninter-worker information exchange network and the sensing models, almost sure\nconvergence of the estimate sequences at the worker nodes to the true parameter\nis established. Further, the paper characterizes the performance of\n$\\mathcal{CREDO}$ in terms of asymptotic covariance of the estimate sequences\nand specifically establishes the achievability of optimal asymptotic\ncovariance. The analysis reveals an interesting interplay between the\nalgorithm's communication cost~$\\mathcal{C}_{t}$ (over $t$ time-steps) and the\nasymptotic covariance. Most notably, it is shown that $\\mathcal{CREDO}$ may be\ndesigned to achieve a $\\Theta\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{t}^{-2+\\zeta}\\right)$ decay of\nthe mean square error~($\\zeta>0$, arbitrarily small) at each worker node, which\nsignificantly improves over the existing $\n\\Theta\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{t}^{-1}\\right)$ rates. Simulation examples on both\nsynthetic and real data sets demonstrate $\\mathcal{CREDO}$'s communication\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 03:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-15"}

While the steady-state behavior of the pathway\nstimulated by a time-invariant signal is relatively well-understood, we show\nusing a computational model that it exhibits a rich repertoire of transient\nadaptive responses to changes in stimuli. When the signal is switched on, the\nresponse is characterized by long-lived modulations in frequency as well as\namplitude. On withdrawing the stimulus, the activity decays over timescales\nmuch longer than that of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes,\nexhibiting reverberations characterized by repeated spiking in the activated\nMAPK concentration. The long-term persistence of such post-stimulus activity\nsuggests that the cascade retains memory of the signal for a significant\nduration following its removal, even in the absence of any explicit feedback or\ncross-talk with other pathways. We find that the molecular mechanism underlying\nthis behavior is related to the existence of distinct relaxation rates for the\ndifferent cascade components. This results in the imbalance of fluxes between\ndifferent layers of the cascade, with the repeated reuse of activated kinases\nas enzymes when they are released from sequestration in complexes leading to\none or more spike events following the removal of the stimulus. The persistent\nadaptive response reported here, indicative of a cellular \"short-term\" memory,\nsuggests that this ubiquitous signaling pathway plays an even more central role\nin information processing by eukaryotic cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 05:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

However, smartphone battery technology hasn't been able to keep\npace with the rapid growth of the capacity and the functionality of smartphones\nand apps. As a result, battery has always been a bottleneck of a user's daily\nexperience of smartphones. An accurate estimation of the remaining battery life\ncould tremendously help the user to schedule their activities and use their\nsmartphones more efficiently. Existing studies on battery life prediction have\nbeen primitive due to the lack of real-world smartphone usage data at scale.\nThis paper presents a novel method that uses the state-of-the-art machine\nlearning models for battery life prediction, based on comprehensive and\nreal-time usage traces collected from smartphones. The proposed method is the\nfirst that identifies and addresses the severe data missing problem in this\ncontext, using a principled statistical metric called the concordance index.\nThe method is evaluated using a dataset collected from 51 users for 21 months,\nwhich covers comprehensive and fine-grained smartphone usage traces including\nsystem status, sensor indicators, system events, and app status. We find that\nthe remaining battery life of a smartphone can be accurately predicted based on\nhow the user uses the device at the real-time, in the current session, and in\nhistory. The machine learning models successfully identify predictive features\nfor battery life and their applicable scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 06:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-15"}

First, considering the complex\ntransformation model between correspondence set in the image-space, feature\npoints of initial candidate matches are projected onto an elevation plane in\nthe object-space, with assistant of UAV flight control data and camera mounting\nangles. Spatial relationships are simplified as a 2D-translation in which a\nmotion establishes the relation of two correspondence points. Second, a\nhierarchical motion consistency constraint, termed HMCC, is designed to\neliminate outliers from initial candidate matches, which includes three major\nsteps, namely the global direction consistency constraint, the local\ndirection-change consistency constraint and the global length consistency\nconstraint. To cope with scenarios with high outlier ratios, the HMCC is\nachieved by using a voting scheme. Finally, an efficient geometrical\nverification strategy is proposed by using the HMCC as a pre-processing step to\nincrease inlier ratios before the consequent application of the basic RANSAC\nalgorithm. The performance of the proposed strategy is verified through\ncomprehensive comparison and analysis by using real UAV datasets captured with\ndifferent photogrammetric systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ngenerated motions have noticeable separation ability, and the HMCC-RANSAC\nalgorithm can efficiently eliminate outliers based on the motion consistency\nconstraint, with a speedup ratio reaching to 6 for oblique UAV images. Even\nthough the completeness sacrifice of approximately 7 percent of points is\nobserved from image orientation tests, competitive orientation accuracy is\nachieved from all used datasets. For geometrical verification of both nadir and\noblique UAV images, the proposed method can be a more efficient solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 09:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-15"}

The computational method is based on the time-dependent conformal\ntransformation of the region occupied by the fluid into a half-plane. In the\nlimit of a strong electric field, when the gravitational and capillary forces\nare negligibly small, there exists an exact analytical solution of the\nelectro-hydrodynamic equations describing propagation without distortions of\nnonlinear surface waves along (or against) the electric field direction. In the\nsituation where gravity and capillarity are taken into account, the results of\nnumerical simulations indeed show that, for large external field, the waves\ntraveling in a given direction tend to preserve their shape. In the limit of a\nstrong electric field, the interaction of counter-propagating waves leads to\nthe formation of regions, where the electrostatic and dynamic pressures undergo\na discontinuity, and the curvature of the surface increases infinitely. The\nFourier spectrum of the surface perturbations tends to the power-law\ndistribution (k^-2). In the case of a finite electric field, the wave\ninteraction results in a radiation of massive cascade of small-scale capillary\nwaves that causes the chaotic behavior of the system. The investigated\nmechanism of interaction between oppositely-traveling waves can enhance\ndevelopment of the capillary turbulence of the fluid surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Upon increasing the chain length and bending stiffness, structural\nreorganisation leads to volumetric expansion of the material and build-up of\ninternal stresses. The VDOS has two dominant bands: a low frequency one\ncorresponding to inter- and intra-chain non-bonding interactions and a high\nfrequency one corresponding principally to vibrations of bonded beads that\nconstitute skeletal chain backbones. Upon increasing the steepness of the\nangular potential, vibrational modes associated with chain bending gradually\nmove from the low-frequency to the high-frequency band. This redistribution of\nmodes is reflected in a reduction of the so-called Boson peak upon increasing\nchain stiffness. Remarkably, the finer structure and the peaks of the\nhigh-frequency band, and their variations with stiffness, can, for short\nchains, be explained using an analytical solution derived for a model triatomic\nmolecule. For longer chains, the qualitative evolution of the VDOS with chain\nstiffness is similar, although the distinct peaks observed for short chains\nbecome increasingly smoothed-out.

One must agree to this statement if one\nreceives the scattering intensity from an assembly of particles as a Bragg\nreflection from a three dimensional random grating. Accordingly, scattered\nwaves at any angle then behave as a circular Gaussian process, and phases are\nequally distributed in the interval (-{\\pi}, +{\\pi}), therefore giving no cue\non the behaviour of the wave scattered at exactly zero angle. So a proof of the\nOptical Theorem would require of telling apart an incoming wave from its weak\nreplica, and gauge the phase in between.

The\nexceptional source state described here makes for an excellent opportunity to\nunderstand physical processes in the jet of S4 0954+65 and thus contribute to\nits classification. We investigate the multiwavelength (MWL) light curve and\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of the S4 0954+65 blazar during an enhanced\nstate in February 2015 and put it in context with possible emission scenarios.\nWe collect photometric data in radio, optical, X-ray, and $\\gamma$ ray. We\nstudy both the optical polarization and the inner parsec-scale jet behavior\nwith 43 GHz data. Observations with the MAGIC telescopes led to the first\ndetection of S4 0954+65 at VHE. Simultaneous data with Fermi-LAT at high energy\n$\\gamma$ ray\\ (HE, 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) also show a period of increased\nactivity.

The\nbroadband spectrum can be modeled with an emission mechanism commonly invoked\nfor flat spectrum radio quasars, i.e. inverse Compton scattering on an external\nsoft photon field from the dust torus, also known as external Compton. The\nlight curve and SED phenomenology is consistent with an interpretation of a\nblob propagating through a helical structured magnetic field and eventually\ncrossing a standing shock in the jet, a scenario typically applied to flat\nspectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBL).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 11:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

The prediction of the impedance of the liners by direct numerical\nsimulations is nowadays not feasible due to the hundreds to thousands\nrepetitions of tiny holes. We introduce a procedure to numerically obtain the\nRayleigh conductivity for acoustic liners for viscous gases at rest, and with\nit define the acoustic impedance of the perforated sheet.\n  Results: The proposed method decouples the effects that are dominant on\ndifferent scales: (a) viscous and incompressible flow at the scale of one hole,\n(b) inviscid and incompressible flow at the scale of the hole pattern, and (c)\ninviscid and compressible flow at the scale of the wave-length. With the method\nof matched asymptotic expansions we couple the different scales and eventually\nobtain effective impedance conditions on the macroscopic scale. For this the\neffective Rayleigh conductivity results by numerical solution of an\ninstationary Stokes problem in frequency domain around one hole with prescribed\npressure at infinite distance to the aperture.

As a first\npractical application, we present a correction to the first estimate of the\nimpact on time delays of the SPT, which has been experimentally found in\nSchneider and Sluse (2013) between a softened power-law and a composite\n(baryons + dark matter) lenses. We find that the large deviations predicted in\nSchneider and Sluse (2014) have been overestimated due to a minor bug (now\nfixed) in the public lens modeling code lensmodel (v1.99). We conclude that the\npredictions for the Hubble constant deviate by $\\sim 7$\\%, first and foremost\ncaused by an MST. The latest version of pySPT is available at\nhttps://github.com/owertz/pySPT. We also provide tutorials to describe in\ndetail how making the best use of pySPT at\nhttps://github.com/owertz/pySPT_tutorials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 12:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

One of the key to resolve this tension is related to\nthe calibration of the period-luminosity (PL) of Cepheids : what is its\nzero-point ? Is it metallicity dependent ? Can we reduce the dispersion of the\nPL relation ? The eclipsing binaries method was recently used to determine the\ndistance to LMC with a 2.2% accuracy, which is crucial to constrain the\nzero-point of the PL relation and to study the impact of metallicity. However,\nthis method is based on the hypothesis that stars are perfect blackbody, which\nis not always the case as shown by inconsistencies in the surface brightness -\ncolor relations of early type stars for instance, that are actually useful for\nthe distance determination of eclipsing binaries in distant galaxies (i.e. M31,\nM33). On the other hand, it is now possible to apply the Baade-Wesselink method\nto Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, however the value of the projection\nfactor and its dependence with the period of Cepheids remains a key issue.\nUnderstanding the dynamical structure of the atmosphere of Cepheids (p-factor,\nk-factor) and their environment cannot be circumvented in order to determine\nthe distance in the universe. This is even more true that the environment of\nCepheids could increase the dispersion of the PL relation.

More recently, they have also been\nused to predict fitness effects of amino-acid substitutions in proteins, and to\npredict evolutionary conserved protein-protein interactions. These models are\nbased on two currently unjustified hypotheses: (a) correlations in the\namino-acid usage of different positions are resulting collectively from\nnetworks of direct couplings; and (b) pairwise couplings are sufficient to\ncapture the amino-acid variability. Here we propose a highly precise inference\nscheme based on Boltzmann-machine learning, which allows us to systematically\naddress these hypotheses.

Moreover, our proposed estimator and its consistent\ncovariance matrix are easily computed with the widely available GMM package.

The external occulter (EO) will be placed\non one satellite ~150 m ahead of the second satellite with an optical\ninstrument. During part of each orbit, the satellites will fly in a precise\nformation, constituting a giant externally occulted coronagraph. Large distance\nbetween the EO and the primary objective will allow observations of the\nwhite-light solar corona starting already from ~1.1RSun. We analyze influence\nof shifts of the satellites and misalignments of optical elements on diffracted\nlight. Based on the quantitative influence of misalignments on diffracted\nlight, we will provide a \"recipe\" for choosing the size of the internal\nocculter (IO) to achieve a trade-off between the minimal height of observations\nand sustainability to possible misalignments. We implement a numerical model of\nthe diffracted light and its propagation through the optical system, and\ncompute intensities of diffracted light throughout the instrument. Our\nnumerical model extends axi-symmetrical model of Rougeot et al. 2017 to\nnon-symmetrical cases. The computations fully confirm main properties of the\ndiffracted light obtained from semi-analytical consideration. Results: relative\ninfluences of various misalignments are significantly different. We show that:\nthe IO with R=1.1RSun is large enough to compensate possible misalignments in\nASPIICS, apodizing the edge of the IO leads to additional suppression of the\ndiffracted light. Conclusions: the most important misalignment is the tilt of\nthe telescope WRT the line connecting the center of the EO and the entrance\naperture. Special care should be taken to co-align the EO and the coronagraph,\ni.e. co-aligning the diffraction fringe from the EO and the IO. We suggest that\nthe best orientation strategy is to point the coronagraph to the center of the\nEO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 15:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}
