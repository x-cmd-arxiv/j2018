While noise models are well known for traditional\nimaging techniques, the noise distribution of a novel sensor may be difficult\nto determine a priori. Therefore, we propose learning arbitrary noise\ndistributions. To do so, this paper proposes a fully connected neural network\nmodel to map samples from a uniform distribution to samples of any explicitly\nknown probability density function. During the training, the Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence between the distribution of the model's output and the target\ndistribution is minimized. We experimentally demonstrate that our model\nconverges towards the desired state. It provides an alternative to existing\nsampling methods such as inversion sampling, rejection sampling, Gaussian\nmixture models and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo. Our model has high sampling\nefficiency and is easily applied to any probability distribution, without the\nneed of further analytical or numerical calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 16:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 08:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Then, coinfection needs to be better diagnosed.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the extinction properties of dust formed in the type\nIIn SN 2005ip. The observed light curves of SN 2005ip all exhibit a sudden drop\naround 50 days after discovery. This has been attributed to dust formation in\nthe dense circumstellar medium. We modeled the intrinsic light curves in six\noptical bands, adopting a theoretical model for the luminosity evolution of\nsupernovae interacting with their circumstellar material. From the difference\nbetween the observed and intrinsic light curves, we calculated extinction\ncurves as a function of time. The total-to-selective extinction ratio, $R_V$,\nwas determined from the extinction in the B and V bands. The resulting\nextinction, $A_V$, increases monotonically up to about 1 mag, 150 days after\ndiscovery. The inferred $R_V$ value also increases slightly with time, but\nappears constant in the range 4.5--8, beyond 100 days after discovery. The\nanalysis confirms that dust is likely formed in SN 2005ip, starting about two\nmonths after explosion. The high value of $R_V$, that is, gray dust, suggests\ndust properties different from of the Milky Way. While this result hinges on\nthe assumed theoretical intrinsic light curve evolution, it is encouraging that\nthe fitted light curves are as expected for standard ejecta and circumstellar\nmedium density structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 16:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

As crater depth\nincreases, slope winds produce increased erosion near the base of the crater\nwall, forming mounds. Peak erosion rates occur when the crater depth is ~2 km.\nMound evolution depends on the size of the host crater. In smaller craters\nmounds preferentially erode at the top, becoming more squat, while in larger\ncraters mounds become steeper-sided. This agrees with observations where\nsmaller craters tend to have proportionally shorter mounds, and larger craters\nhave mounds encircled by moats.

Two sub-Riemannian metrics on $(M,D)$ are said to be\nprojectively (resp. affinely) equivalent if they have the same geodesics up to\nreparameterization (resp. up to affine reparameterization). A sub-Riemannian\nmetric $g$ is called rigid (resp. conformally rigid) with respect to\nprojective/affine equivalence, if any sub-Riemannian metric which is\nprojectively/affinely equivalent to $g$ is constantly proportional to $g$\n(resp. conformal to $g$). In the Riemannian case the local classification of\nprojectively and affinely equivalent metrics is classical (Levi-Civita,\nEisenhart). In particular, a Riemannian metric which is not rigid satisfies the\nfollowing two special properties: its geodesic flow possesses nontrivial\nintegrals and the metric induces certain canonical product structure on the\nambient manifold. These classification results were extended to contact and\nquasi-contact distributions by Zelenko. Our general goal is to extend these\nresults to arbitrary sub-Riemannian manifolds, and we establish two types of\nresults toward this goal: if a sub-Riemannian metric is not projectively\nconformally rigid, then, first, its flow of normal extremals has at least one\nnontrivial integral quadratic on the fibers of the cotangent bundle and,\nsecond, the nilpotent approximation of the underlying distribution at any point\nadmits a product structure. As a consequence we obtain two types of genericity\nresults: first, we show that a generic sub-Riemannian metric on a fixed pair\n$(M,D)$ is projectively conformally rigid. Second, we prove that, except for\nspecial pairs $(m,n)$, every sub-Riemannian metric on a rank $m$ generic\ndistribution in an $n$-dimensional manifold is projectively conformally rigid.\nFor the affine equivalence in both genericity results conformal rigidity can be\nreplaced by usual rigidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 18:11:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 06:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

We keep the jet power and duration fixed,\nvarying only the jet angle prescription. We track the total energy of the\nintracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core over time, and the fraction of\nthe jet energy transferred to the ICM, paying attention to where the energy is\ndeposited.

Accurately measuring $t_{\\rm ff}$\nis crucial because according to numerical simulations cold gas condensation and\nstrong feedback occur in cluster cores with min($t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}$)\nbelow a threshold value close to 10. Recent observations which include the BCG\ngravity show that the observed threshold in min($t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}$) lies\nat a somewhat higher value, close to 10-30; there are only a few clusters in\nwhich this ratio falls much below 10. In this paper we compare numerical\nsimulations of feedback AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) jets interacting with the\nintracluster medium (ICM), with and without a BCG potential. We find that, for\na fixed feedback efficiency, the presence of a BCG does not significantly\naffect the temperature but increases (decreases) the core density (entropy) on\naverage. Most importantly, min($t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}$) is only affected\nslightly by the inclusion of the BCG gravity. Also notable is that the lowest\nvalue of min($t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}$) in the NFW+BCG runs are about twice\nlarger than in the NFW runs. We also look at the role of depletion of cold gas\ndue to star formation and show that it only affects the rotationally dominant\ncomponent (torus), while the radially dominant component (which regulates the\nfeedback cycle) remains largely unaffected. The distribution of metals due to\nAGN jets in our simulations is predominantly along the jet direction and the\nradial spread of metals is less.

Flow\ndecomposition provides a way of manipulating regular decode-forward schemes\nwithout the long encoding delays and restrictions on bidirectional\ncommunication of backward decoding.

Our\npreliminary results show: 1) Among 47 SEP events, 39 of which do not have\ndetectable flare emissions in white light and SXR. 2) Most strong WLFs are not\nassociated with SEPs. 3) No clear correlation is found between the proton flux\nand the equivalent area, a quantity that measures the magnitude of WLF\nemission. A straightforward speculation is that the acceleration process could\nbe different for SEPs and the energetic electrons powering WLFs in the events\nanalyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 21:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

Reporting thorax diseases using chest X-rays is often an\nentry-level task for radiologist trainees. Yet, reading a chest X-ray image\nremains a challenging job for learning-oriented machine intelligence, due to\n(1) shortage of large-scale machine-learnable medical image datasets, and (2)\nlack of techniques that can mimic the high-level reasoning of human\nradiologists that requires years of knowledge accumulation and professional\ntraining. In this paper, we show the clinical free-text radiological reports\ncan be utilized as a priori knowledge for tackling these two key problems. We\npropose a novel Text-Image Embedding network (TieNet) for extracting the\ndistinctive image and text representations. Multi-level attention models are\nintegrated into an end-to-end trainable CNN-RNN architecture for highlighting\nthe meaningful text words and image regions. We first apply TieNet to classify\nthe chest X-rays by using both image features and text embeddings extracted\nfrom associated reports. The proposed auto-annotation framework achieves high\naccuracy (over 0.9 on average in AUCs) in assigning disease labels for our\nhand-label evaluation dataset. Furthermore, we transform the TieNet into a\nchest X-ray reporting system. It simulates the reporting process and can output\ndisease classification and a preliminary report together.

We consider the scenario where the\nnonlinear interaction of overlapping large-scale modes stirs up a broad\nspectrum of small-scale modes, generating tearing mode turbulence. The spectrum\nof such turbulence is of interest since it is relevant to the small-scale\nback-reaction to the large-scale field. The turbulence we discuss here differs\nfrom traditional MHD turbulence mainly in two aspects, one being the existence\nof many linearly stable small-scale modes which cause an effective damping\nduring energy cascade; the other being the scale independent anisotropy induced\nby the large scale modes tilting the sheared background field, as opposed to\nthe scale dependent anisotropy frequently encountered in traditional weak\nturbulence or critically balanced turbulence theory. These two differences\nresult in the deviation of energy spectrum from a simple power law behavior,\ntaking the form of a power law multiplied by an exponential falloff.

To accomplish\nthis, the sensor-failed vehicle must predict the future semantic behaviors of\nother drivers, such as lane changes, as well as their future trajectories given\na recent window of past sensor observations. We address the first issue of\nsemantic behavior prediction in this paper, which is a precursor to trajectory\nprediction, by introducing a framework that leverages the power of recurrent\nneural networks (RNNs) and graphical models. Our goal is to predict the future\ncategorical driving intent, for lane changes, of neighboring vehicles up to\nthree seconds into the future given as little as a one-second window of past\nLIDAR, GPS, inertial, and map data.\n  We collect real-world data containing over 20 hours of highway driving using\nan autonomous Toyota vehicle. We propose a composite RNN model by adopting the\nmethodology of Structural Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to learn factor\nfunctions and take advantage of both the high-level structure of graphical\nmodels and the sequence modeling power of RNNs, which we expect to afford more\ntransparent modeling and activity than opaque, single RNN models. To\ndemonstrate our approach, we validate our model using authentic interstate\nhighway driving to predict the future lane change maneuvers of other vehicles\nneighboring our autonomous vehicle. We find that our composite Structural RNN\noutperforms baselines by as much as 12% in balanced accuracy metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 22:16:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Mar 2018 22:07:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 04:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 16:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

We\ndemonstrate the method with two examples of fast halo CMEs ($\\sim$ 2000 km\ns$^{-1}$) observed on 2011 March 7 and 2014 February 25. Our method uses the\nellipsoid model to derive the three-dimensional (3D) geometry and kinematics of\nthe fronts. The density profiles of the sheaths are modeled with\ndouble-Gaussian functions with four free parameters and the electrons are\ndistributed within thin shells behind the front. The modeled densities are\nintegrated along the lines of sight to be compared with the observed brightness\nin COR2-A, and a $\\chi^2$ approach is used to obtain the optimal parameters for\nthe Gaussian profiles. The upstream densities are obtained from both the\ninversion of the brightness in a pre-event image and an empirical model. Then\nthe density ratio and Alfv\\'{e}nic Mach number are derived. We find that the\ndensity compression peaks around the CME nose, and decreases at larger position\nangles. The behavior is consistent with a driven shock at the nose and a\nfreely-propagating shock wave at the CME flanks. Interestingly, we find that\nthe supercritical region extends over a large area of the shock and last longer\n(several tens of minutes) than past reports. It follows that CME shocks are\ncapable of accelerating energetic particles in the corona over extended spatial\nand temporal scales and are likely responsible for the wide longitudinal\ndistribution of these particles in the inner heliosphere.

A new\narchitecture, denoted the FeATure TransfEr Network (FATTEN), is proposed for\nthe modeling of feature trajectories induced by variations of object pose. This\narchitecture exploits a parametrization of the pose manifold in terms of pose\nand appearance. This leads to a deep encoder/decoder network architecture,\nwhere the encoder factors into an appearance and a pose predictor. Unlike\nprevious attempts at trajectory transfer, FATTEN can be efficiently trained\nend-to-end, with no need to train separate feature transfer functions. This is\nrealized by supplying the decoder with information about a target pose and the\nuse of a multi-task loss that penalizes category- and pose-mismatches. In\nresult, FATTEN discourages discontinuous or non-smooth trajectories that fail\nto capture the structure of the pose manifold, and generalizes well on object\nrecognition tasks involving large pose variation.

On the contrary, the Si IV 1402.77 line reveals a persistent red-wing\nasymmetry in both the impulsive and decay phases, suggesting that this line\nresponds to both cooling downflows and chromospheric condensation. The first\ntwo episodes of red-wing enhancement occurred around 11:42 UT and 11:45 UT,\nwhen two moving brightenings indicative of heating fronts crossed the IRIS\nslit. The greatly enhanced red wings of the Si IV and Mg II lines at these\noccasions are accompanied by an obvious increase in the line intensities and\nthe HXR flux, suggesting two episodes of energy injection into the lower\natmosphere in the form of nonthermal electrons. The Mg II k/h ratio has a small\nvalue of ~1.2 at the ribbons and decreases to ~1.1 at these two occasions.\nCorrespondingly, the Fe XXI 1354 line reveals two episodes of chromospheric\nevaporation, which is characterized as a smooth decrease of the blue shift from\n~300 km/s to nearly zero within ~3 minutes. The Fe XXI 1354 line is entirely\nblueshifted in the first episode, while appears to contain a nearly stationary\ncomponent and a blueshifted component in the second episode. More episodes of\nblueshifted Fe XXI emission is found around the northern ribbon in the decay\nphase, though no obvious response is detected in the Si IV and Mg II emission.\nWe have also examined the Fe XXI emission at the flare loop top and identified\na secondary component with a ~200 km/s red shift, which possibly results from\nthe downward moving reconnection outflow.

One is to investigate how frequently\nwhite-light flares (WLFs) occur in a flare-productive active region (NOAA\nactive region 11515). The other is to investigate the relationship between WLFs\nand magnetic transients (MTs). We use the full-disk continuum filtergrams and\nline-of-sight magnetograms taken by SDO/HMI to identify WLFs and MTs,\nrespectively. Images taken by SDO/AIA are also used to show the morphology of\nthe flares in the upper atmosphere. We found at least 20 WLFs out of a total of\n70 flares above C class (28.6%) in NOAA active region 11515 during its passage\nacross the solar disk. Each of these WLFs occurred in a small region, with a\nshort duration of about 5 minutes. The enhancement of white-light continuum\nintensity is usually small, with an average enhancement of 8.1%. The 20 WLFs\nobserved were found along an unusual configuration of the magnetic field\ncharacterized by a narrow ribbon of negative field. Furthermore, the WLFs were\nfound to be accompanied by MTs, with radical changes in magnetic field strength\n(or even a sign reversal) observed during the flare. In contrast, there is no\nobvious signature of MTs in those 50 flares without white-light enhancements.\nOur results suggest that WLFs occur much more frequently than what was\npreviously thought, with most WLFs being fairly weak enhancements. This may\nexplain why WLFs are not frequently reported. Our observations also suggest\nthat MTs and WLFs are closely related and appear co-spatial and co-temporal,\nwhen considering HMI data. A larger enhancement of WL emission is often\naccompanied by a larger change of the line-of-sight component of the unsigned\nmagnetic field.

The dealer wants to\nsecurely convey a specific secret $s_j$ to user $j$ via storage nodes, for\n$j=1,2,...,m$. More specifically, two secrecy conditions are considered in this\nmulti-user context. The weak secrecy condition is that each user does not get\nany information about the individual secrets of other users, while the perfect\nsecrecy condition implies that a user does not get any information about the\ncollection of all other users' secrets. In this system, the dealer encodes\nsecrets into several secret shares and loads them into the storage nodes. Given\na certain number of storage nodes we find the maximum number of users that can\nbe served in such a system and construct schemes that achieve this with perfect\nsecrecy. Lower bounds on the minimum communication complexity and the storage\noverhead are characterized given any $n$ and $m$.

Until recently, there were few works applying deep learning on\nimbalanced time-series classification (ITSC) tasks. Here, this paper aimed at\ntackling ITSC problems with deep learning. An adaptive cost-sensitive learning\nstrategy was proposed to modify temporal deep learning models. Through the\nproposed strategy, classifiers could automatically assign misclassification\npenalties to each class. In the experimental section, the proposed method was\nutilized to modify five neural networks. They were evaluated on a large volume,\nreal-life and imbalanced time-series dataset with six metrics.

Subsequently, we show\ndeterministic, iterative tuning of individual cavities by direct-write,\nsingle-step EBIE without significant degradation of the Q-factor. The\ndemonstration of tunable, high Q cavities made from hBN is an unprecedented\nadvance in nanophotonics based on van der Waals materials. Our results and hBN\nprocessing methods open up promising new avenues for solid-state systems with\napplications in integrated quantum photonics, polaritonics and cavity QED\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2018 08:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Multi-wavelength data are\nemployed to analyze the WLF, including white light (WL), ultraviolet, extreme\nultraviolet, hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave. A close spatial and temporal\nrelationship between the WL, HXR and microwave emissions is found in this WLF.\nHowever, the peak time of the WL emission lagged that of the HXR and microwave\nemissions by about 1-2 minutes.

In large scale networks like the Internet of Things\n(IoT), however, this feature significantly increases BC storage size and raises\nprivacy challenges. In this paper, we propose a Memory Optimized and Flexible\nBC (MOF-BC) that enables the IoT users and service providers to remove or\nsummarize their transactions and age their data and to exercise the \"right to\nbe forgotten\". To increase privacy, a user may employ multiple keys for\ndifferent transactions. To allow for the removal of stored transactions, all\nkeys would need to be stored which complicates key management and storage.\nMOF-BC introduces the notion of a Generator Verifier (GV) which is a signed\nhash of a Generator Verifier Secret (GVS). The GV changes for each transaction\nto provide privacy yet is signed by a unique key, thus minimizing the\ninformation that needs to be stored. A flexible transaction fee model and a\nreward mechanism is proposed to incentivize users to participate in optimizing\nmemory consumption. Qualitative security and privacy analysis demonstrates that\nMOF-BC is resilient against several security attacks. Evaluation results show\nthat MOF-BC decreases BC memory consumption by up to 25\\% and the user cost by\nmore than two orders of magnitude compared to conventional BC instantiations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2018 11:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

However, many studies have dealt with SFR\nusing unresolved measurements, which makes it difficult to separate out the\ncontamination from other ionizing sources, such as active galactic nuclei and\nevolved stars. Using the integral field spectroscopic observations from SDSS-IV\nMaNGA, we spatially disentangle the contribution from different H{\\alpha}\npowering sources for ~1000 galaxies. We find that, when including regions\ndominated by all ionizing sources in galaxies, the spatially-resolved relation\nbetween H{\\alpha} surface density ({\\Sigma}H{\\alpha}(all)) and stellar mass\nsurface density ({\\Sigma}*(all)) progressively turns over at high\n{\\Sigma}*(all) end for increasing M*(global) and bulge dominance\n(bulge-to-total light ratio, B/T). This in turn leads to the flattening of the\nintegrated H{\\alpha}(global)-M*(global) relation in the literature. By\ncontrast, there is no noticeable flattening in both integrated\nH{\\alpha}(HII)-M*(HII) and spatially-resolved\n{\\Sigma}H{\\alpha}(HII)-{\\Sigma}*(HII) relations when only regions where star\nformation dominates the ionization are considered. In other words, the\nflattening can be attributed to the increasing regions powered by\nnon-star-formation sources, which generally have lower ionizing ability than\nstar formation. Analysis of the fractional contribution of non-star-formation\nsources to total H{\\alpha} luminosity of a galaxy suggests a decreasing role of\nstar formation as an ionizing source toward high-mass, high-B/T galaxies and\nbulge regions. This result indicates that the appearance of the galaxy\nintegrated SFR-M* relation critically depends on their global properties\n(M*(global) and B/T) and relative abundances of various ionizing sources within\nthe galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2018 14:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

To\nevaluate average magnetization (or the order parameter), it is assumed that the\naverage magnetization can be related to infinitely apart two spin correlation\nfunction as $<\\sigma>^{2}=<\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{N}>$. A discussion to justify this\nconsideration is given in the introduction with a relevant manner. It is\nobtained that $<\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{1}>=\\tanh{K}$, which is exactly the same\nrelation as the previously derived relation by considering the configurational\nspace equivalence of $\\{\\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{i+1}\\}=\\{s_{i}\\}$ and the result of\ntransfer matrix method in the absence of external field. By applying further\nblock-spin transformation, it is obtained that\n$\\{\\sigma_{0}\\sigma_{j}\\}=(\\tanh{K})^{j}$, here $j$ assumes the values of\n$j=2^n$, here $n$ is an integer numbers. We believe that this result is really\nimportant in that it is the only exact unique treatment of the 1D Ising chain\nbeside with the transfer matrix method. It is also pointed out the irrelevances\nof some of the alternative derivation appearing in graduate level text books.\nThe obtained unique correlation relation in this this study leads in the limit\nof $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ to $<\\sigma_{i}>=(\\tanh{K})^{N/2}$, indicating that the\nsecond order phase transition is only possible in the limit of\n$K\\rightarrow\\infty$.

The corresponding room-temperature sheet\nthermal conductance of AsP monolayer is 152.5 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$.

We address\nthe issue by adding a non-mesogenic additive 2, 3-dicyano-4-pentyloxyphenyl\n4'-pentyloxybenzoate (DPP) with a large transverse dipole moment to mesogenic\nmaterials in order to enhance their negative dielectric anisotropy. The DPP\ndoping substantially increases the field-induced birefringence in both NEMOP\nand Kerr effects, up to 0.02. The doping also slows down the switching\nprocesses, but this effect can be compensated by rising working temperatures,\nif necessary. The enhancement of field induced birefringence by the\nnon-mesogenic dopant paves the way for practical applications of nanosecond\nelectro-optic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2018 18:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

We introduce a notion of evolutionary Gamma-convergence\nthat relates the microscopic energy and the microscopic dissipation potential\nwith their macroscopic limits via Gamma-convergence. This new notion\ngeneralizes the concept of EDP-convergence, which was introduced in\narXiv:1507.06322, and is called \"relaxed EDP-convergence\". Both notions are\nbased on De Giorgi's energy-dissipation principle, however the special\nstructure of the dissipation functional in terms of the primal and dual\ndissipation potential is, in general, not preserved under Gamma-convergence. By\ninvestigating the kinetic relation directly and using general forcings we still\nderive a unique macroscopic dissipation potential.\n  The wiggly-energy model of James et al serves as a prototypical example where\nthis nontrivial limit passage can be fully analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2018 14:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}
