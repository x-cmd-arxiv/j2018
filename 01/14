It is a challenging problem due to its ill-posedness nature and has\nfound wide application in industry. Previous efforts belongs roughly to two\nfamilies: learning-based method and interactive method. Learning-based method,\nin which deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is widely used, can achieve\ngood result. But they suffer low generalization ability and typically perform\npoorly for unfamiliar scenes. Besides, data-hungry nature for such method makes\ndata aquisition expensive and time-consuming. Interactive method requires human\nannotation of depth which, however, is errorneous and of large variance.\n  To overcome these problems, we propose a new perspective for single monocular\nimage depth estimation problem: size to depth. Our method require sparse label\nfor real-world size of object rather than raw depth. A Coarse depth map is then\ninferred following geometric relationships according to size labels. Then we\nrefine the depth map by doing energy function optimization on conditional\nrandom field(CRF). We experimentally demonstrate that our method outperforms\ntraditional depth-labeling methods and can produce satisfactory depth maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

The kinetic energy $E$ of the turbulent\nflow and the order parameter $M$, a measure of the spatially organised\nmodulation of turbulence, are sampled and processed in view analytical results\nfrom the phenomenology of phase transitions. The first crossover concerns the\nloss of spatial organisation of turbulence in the flow. In the band phase, the\norder parameter $M$ decreases continuously with the Reynolds number $R$ toward\na small value, while its response function $\\chi_M$ displays a maximum at the\ncrossover. In the uniform phase, the order parameter $M$ and its variance\n$\\sigma$ decrease toward zero following mean field field scalings $M,\\sigma\n\\propto 1/\\sqrt{L_xL_z(R-R_c)}$ as $R$ is increased.

This sharp increase is concomitant with a maximum of\nthe response function of the kinetic energy. The finite size analysis reveals\nthat the jump does not steepen and that the maximum of response function of $E$\nsaturates as size is increased. The first crossover is formally identical to a\ncritical phenomenon in condensed matter. The second crossover is in agreement\nwith a first order phase transition smeared by finite noise.

Recent studies of silicon CMOS\nqubits have shown coherent manipulation of electron spin states with extremely\nhigh fidelity. However, manipulation of single electron spins requires large\noscillatory magnetic fields to be generated on-chip, making it difficult to\naddress individual qubits when scaling up to multi-qubit devices. The\nspin-orbit interaction allows spin states to be controlled with electric\nfields, which act locally and are easier to generate. While the spin-orbit\ninteraction is weak for electrons in silicon, valence band holes have an\ninherently strong spin-orbit interaction. However, creating silicon quantum\ndots in which a single hole can be localised, in an architecture that is\nsuitable for scale-up to a large number of qubits, is a challenge.

In this work,\nwe report both experimental and theoretical evidence of temporal scaling\nbehavior of the growth dependent radiative properties of microalgae cell\nsuspensions. A new concept, the temporal scaling function (TSF), defined as the\nratio of absorption or scattering cross-sections at growth phase to that at\nstationary phase, is introduced to characterize the temporal scaling. The\ntemporal evolution and temporal scaling characteristics of the absoroption and\nscattering cross-sections of three example microalgae species, Chlorella\nvulgaris, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and Chlorella protothecoides, were\nexperimentally studied at spectral range 380 to 850 nm.

With the aid of the temporal scaling\nrelation, the radiative properties of microalgae at any growth time can be\ncalculated based on those measured at stationary phase.

The network is composed of non-saturating linear\nthreshold neurons.

In five of the\nsources the spatial distribution of emission from N2H+ and CO isotopologues\nshows a clear anti-correlation.

The\npositions of the CO snow lines traced by the N2H+ emission are located at much\nlarger radii than those calculated using the current luminosities of the\ncentral sources.

In addition it can be noticed that this dip was followed by a\nbirth rebound a few months later. However having made this observation,\nBertillon did not explore it further. Since that time the phenomenon was not\nrevisited in spite of the fact that in the meanwhile there have been several\nnew cases of massive death spikes. The aim here is to analyze these new cases\nto get a better understanding of this death-birth coupling phenomenon. The\nlargest death spikes occurred in the wake of more recent influenza pandemics in\n1918 and 1920, others were triggered by the 1923 earthquakes in Tokyo and the\nTwin Tower attack on September 11, 2001. We shall see that the first of these\nevents indeed produced an extra dip in births whereas the 9/11 event did not.\nThis disparity highlights the pivotal role of collateral sufferers. In the last\nsection it is shown how the present coupling leads to predictions; it can\nexplain in a unified way effects which so far have been studied separately, as\nfor instance the impact on birth rates of heat waves. Thus, it appears that\nbehind the random appearance of birth rate fluctuations there are in fact\nhidden explanatory factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 10:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed\nAPs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory\ndesign, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize\nthe system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common\n(minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period,\nsubject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality\nconstraints. The resulted problem is non-convex and thus difficult to be solved\noptimally.

We first recall the algorithm known as\nPM-Basis, which will be our second fundamental engine after polynomial matrix\nmultiplication: most other fast approximant basis algorithms basically aim at\nefficiently reducing the input instance to instances for which PM-Basis is\nfast. Such reductions usually involve partial linearization techniques due to\nStorjohann, which have the effect of balancing the degrees and dimensions in\nthe manipulated matrices.\n  Following these ideas, Zhou and Labahn gave two algorithms which are faster\nthan PM-Basis for important cases including Hermite-Pade approximation, yet\nonly for shifts whose values are concentrated around the minimum or the maximum\nvalue. The three mentioned algorithms were designed for balanced orders and\ncompute approximant bases that are generally not normalized. Here, we show how\nthey can be modified to return the shifted Popov basis without impact on their\ncost bound; besides, we extend Zhou and Labahn's algorithms to arbitrary\norders.\n  Furthermore, we give an algorithm which handles arbitrary shifts with one\nextra logarithmic factor in the cost bound compared to the above algorithms. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this improves upon previously known algorithms for\narbitrary shifts, including for particular cases such as Hermite-Pade\napproximation.

In short, the beneficial effect of\nmulti-user interference on RF energy harvesting is obtained at the price of a\nreduced link capacity, thus originating nontrivial trade-offs between the\nachievable information rate and the harvestable energy. Arguably, in indoor\nenvironments, this trade-off might be affected by the propagation loss due to\nblockage objects like walls. Hence, a couple of fundamental questions arise.\nHow much must the network elements be densified to counteract the blockage\nattenuation? Is blockage always detrimental on the achievable rate-energy\ntrade-off? In this paper, we analyse the performance of an indoor\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SWIPT-enabled network in the attempt to\nshed a light of those questions. The effects of the obstacles are examined with\nthe help of a stochastic approach in which energy transmitters (also referred\nto as power heads) are located by using a Poisson Point Process and walls are\ngenerated through a Manhattan Poisson Line Process. The stochastic behaviour of\nthe signal attenuation and the multi-user interference is studied to obtain the\nJoint Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (J-CCDF) of information\nrate and harvested power. Theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Eventually, the rate-energy trade-off is presented as a function\nof the frequency of walls to emphasise the cross-dependences between the\ndeployment of the network elements and the topology of the venue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 14:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

We find that all the 2pcf measurements depend strongly on $\\alpha$,\nwith factors of $\\sim20$ between the large-scale 2pcf of objects in the most\nand least isotropic environments. To test whether these strong trends imply\n`beyond halo mass' effects for galaxy evolution, we compare our results with\ncorresponding 2pcf measurements in mock catalogs constructed using a halo\noccupation distribution that only uses halo mass as an input. We find that this\nprescription qualitatively reproduces $\\textit{all}$ observed trends, and also\nquantitatively matches many of the observed results. Although there are some\nstatistically significant differences between our `halo mass only' mocks and\nthe data -- in the most and least isotropic environments -- which deserve\nfurther investigation, our results suggest that if the tidal environment\ninduces additional effects on galaxy properties other than those inherited from\ntheir host halos, then these must be weak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 15:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 03:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Some scholars have suggested that such tools should\nbe sensitive enough to alert us when two election outcomes have the same\npercentage of votes going to political party $A$, but one of the two awards\nparty $A$ more seats. When a metric is able to distinguish election outcomes in\nthis way, that metric is said to satisfy the efficiency principle.\n  In this article, we show that the efficiency gap fails to satisfy the\nefficiency principle.

In\norder to make this theory compatible with general relativity, the quantum\neffects are described in the framework of quantum field theory, where a\ncovariant definition of `simultaneity' for many-body systems is introduced\nthrough the definition of a suited foliation of space-time. As in Einstein's\ngravitation theory, the particle dynamics is finally described by means of a\ngeodesic equation in a curved space-time manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2018 20:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 22:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 19:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 11:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 15:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 08:09:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 19:50:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 14:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 21:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 11:40:00 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 16:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 21:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 09:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

This distance\nfunction is based on the concept of $f$-divergence, a distance measure\ntraditionally used to measure the difference between two probability\ndistributions. The relevant probability distributions in our case are the\nPoisson kernels of the domain at $x$ and at $y$. We prove that for the\n$\\chi^2$-divergence distance, the gradient by $x$ of $D$ is opposite in\ndirection to the gradient by $x$ of $G(x,y)$, the Green's function with pole\n$y$. Since $G$ is harmonic, this implies that $D$, like $G$, has a single\nextremum in $\\Omega$, namely at $y$ where $D$ vanishes. Thus $D$ can be used to\ntrace a gradient-descent path within~$\\Omega$ from $x$ to $y$ by following\n$\\nabla_x D(x,y)$, which has significant computational advantages over tracing\nthe gradient of $G$. This result can be used for robotic path-planning in\ncomplex geometric environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 14:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

In the\nabove mentioned paper, the authors found that by doing an orthogonal projection\n$Y_f^h/Y_p^h$, one can identify the future horizontal state matrix\n$\\widehat{X}_f^{h}$ with a small bias due to the initial conditions that depend\non $\\{\\widehat{X}_p^{vh},\\widehat{X}_f^{vh}\\}$.

In this note we delve into the\nbias term and prove that it is insignificant, provided $i$ is chosen large\nenough and the vertical and horizontal states are uncorrelated.

We also present a second iteration to improve the state\nestimates by including the vertical states computed from a vertical data\nprocessing step, i.e., by doing an orthogonal projection $Y_f^v/Y_p^v$. In this\nrevised algorithm we include a step to compute the initial states.
