Firstly, the conventional implementation for 3D CLBM\ninvolves cumbersome operations and requires much higher computational cost\ncompared to the single-relaxation-time (SRT) LBM. Secondly, it is a challenge\nto accurately incorporate a general force field into the 3D CLBM. In this\npaper, we present an improved method to implement CLBM in 3D. The main strategy\nis to adopt a simplified central moment set, and carry out the\ncentral-moment-based collision operator based on a general\nmulti-relaxation-time (GMRT) framework. Next, the recently proposed consistent\nforcing scheme in CLBM [L. Fei and K. H. Luo, Phys. Rev. E \\textbf{96}, 053307\n(2017)] is extended to incorporate a general force field into 3D CLBM.

Our approach improves on previous estimates by\nexplicitly accounting for injecting drug use and including data from high-risk\nsubpopulations such as the incarcerated, and is more inclusive, utilizing ten\nNYC data sources.

Previous efforts have shown that agent-based, multi-scale\nmodeling systems can integrate physical and biological rules and provide new\navenues to study developmental systems. However, the application of these\nsystems to model cell movement is still challenging and requires a\ncomprehensive understanding of regulation networks at the right scales. Recent\ndevelopments in deep learning and reinforcement learning provide an\nunprecedented opportunity to explore cell movement using 3D time-lapse images.\nWe present a deep reinforcement learning approach within an ABM system to\ncharacterize cell movement in C. elegans embryogenesis. Our modeling system\ncaptures the complexity of cell movement patterns in the embryo and overcomes\nthe local optimization problem encountered by traditional rule-based, ABM that\nuses greedy algorithms. We tested our model with two real developmental\nprocesses: the anterior movement of the Cpaaa cell via intercalation and the\nrearrangement of the left-right asymmetry. In the first case, model results\nshowed that Cpaaa's intercalation is an active directional cell movement caused\nby the continuous effects from a longer distance, as opposed to a passive\nmovement caused by neighbor cell movements. This is because the learning-based\nsimulation found that a passive movement model could not lead Cpaaa to the\npredefined destination. In the second case, a leader-follower mechanism well\nexplained the collective cell movement pattern. These results showed that our\napproach to introduce deep reinforcement learning into ABM can test regulatory\nmechanisms by exploring cell migration paths in a reverse engineering\nperspective. This model opens new doors to explore large datasets generated by\nlive imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 19:33:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 19:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

Unfortunately, this leads\nto two issues: (1) apps that do not require access to all of the granted device\noperations have overprivileged access to them, (2) apps might pose a higher\nrisk to users than needed because physical device operations are fundamentally\nrisk-asymmetric-\"door.unlock\" provides access to burglars, and \"door.lock\" can\npotentially lead to getting locked out.

Sex differences in executive\nfunction in youth have been linked to vulnerability to psychopathology as well\nas to behaviors that impinge on health. Yet, the neurobiological basis of these\ndifferences is not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that sex\ndifferences in executive function in youth stem from sex differences in the\ncontrollability of structural brain networks as they rewire over development.\nCombining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we\ncharacterize the network control properties of structural brain networks\nestimated from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample\nof 882 youth aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these\nnetworks by estimating average and modal controllability, two statistics that\nprobe the ease with which brain areas can drive the network towards easy-\nversus difficult-to-reach states. We find that females have higher modal\ncontrollability in frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions while males have\nhigher average controllability in frontal and subcortical regions. Furthermore,\naverage controllability values in the medial frontal cortex and subcortex, both\nhigher in males, are negatively related to executive function. Finally, we find\nthat average controllability predicts sex-dependent individual differences in\nactivation during an n-back working memory task. Taken together, our findings\nsupport the notion that sex differences in the controllability of structural\nbrain networks can partially explain sex differences in executive function.\nControllability of structural brain networks also predicts features of\ntask-relevant activation, suggesting the potential for controllability to\nrepresent context-specific constraints on network state more generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

The cavity contribution is obtained for two different envelopes,\n$\\Sigma_{SE}$ which theory identifies as the solvent excluded volume and a\nlarger envelope ($\\Sigma_G$) beyond which solute-solvent interactions are\nGaussian. For both envelopes, the cavity contribution in water is proportional\nto the surface area of the envelope. The same does not hold for GdmCl(aq),\nrevealing limitations of using molecular area to assess solvation energetics,\nespecially in mixed solvents. The $\\Sigma_G$-cavity contribution predicts that\nGdmCl(aq) should favor the more compact state, contrary to the role of GdmCl in\nunfolding proteins. The chemistry contribution attenuates this effect, but\nstill the net local (chemistry plus $\\Sigma_G$-packing) contribution is\ninadequate in capturing the role of GdmCl. With the inclusion of the long-range\ncontribution, which is dominated by van~der~Waals interaction, aqueous GdmCl\nfavors the extended conformation over the compact conformation. Our finding\nemphasizes the importance of weak, but attractive, long-range dispersion\ninteractions in protein solution thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 03:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

We do this by applying structural compression, whereby we reduce a\nblock of layers to a single layer. After compressing a set of layers, we apply\na combination of initialization and training schemes, and look at network\naccuracy, convergence, and the layer's learned filters to assess the\ncriticality of the layer. We apply this analysis across four data sets of\nvarying complexity.

One key issue\nof arithmetic encoding method is to predict the probability of the current\ncoding symbol from its context, i.e., the preceding encoded symbols, which\nusually can be executed by building a look-up table (LUT). However, the\ncomplexity of LUT increases exponentially with the length of context. Thus,\nsuch solutions are limited to modeling large context, which inevitably\nrestricts the compression performance. Several recent deep neural network-based\nsolutions have been developed to account for large context, but are still\ncostly in computation. The inefficiency of the existing methods are mainly\nattributed to that probability prediction is performed independently for the\nneighboring symbols, which actually can be efficiently conducted by shared\ncomputation. To this end, we propose a trimmed convolutional network for\narithmetic encoding (TCAE) to model large context while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. As for trimmed convolution, the convolutional kernels\nare specially trimmed to respect the compression order and context dependency\nof the input symbols. Benefited from trimmed convolution, the probability\nprediction of all symbols can be efficiently performed in one single forward\npass via a fully convolutional network.

As another\nconsequence of our results on partial eigenvarieties, we show, still under the\nassumption that p is totally split in F, that the full (dimension 1 + d)\ncuspidal Hilbert modular eigenvariety has the property that many (all, if d is\neven) irreducible components contain a classical point with non-critical slopes\nand parallel weight 2 (with some character at p whose conductor can be\nexplicitly bounded), or any other algebraic weight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 10:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 14:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

Nevertheless, classic Krylov subspace algorithms do\nnot scale well on massively parallel hardware due to synchronization\nbottlenecks. Communication-hiding pipelined Krylov subspace methods offer\nincreased parallel scalability by overlapping the time-consuming global\ncommunication phase with computations such as spmvs, hence reducing the impact\nof the global synchronization and avoiding processor idling. One of the first\npublished methods in this class is the pipelined Conjugate Gradient method\n(p-CG). However, on large numbers of processors the communication phase may\ntake much longer than the computation of a single spmv. This work extends the\npipelined CG method to deeper pipelines, denoted as p(l)-CG, which allows\nfurther scaling when the global communication phase is the dominant\ntime-consuming factor. By overlapping the global all-to-all reduction phase in\neach CG iteration with the next l spmvs (deep pipelining), the method hides\ncommunication latency behind additional computational work. The p(l)-CG\nalgorithm is derived from similar principles as the existing p(l)-GMRES method\nand by exploiting operator symmetry. The p(l)-CG method is also compared to\nother Krylov subspace methods, including the closely related classic CG and\nD-Lanczos methods and the pipelined CG method by Ghysels et al.. By analyzing\nthe maximal accuracy attainable by the p(l)-CG method it is shown that the\npipelining technique induces a trade-off between performance and numerical\nstability. A preconditioned version of the algorithm is also proposed and\nstorage requirements and performance estimates are discussed.

Flares lasting from minutes to 14 hr were observed for\n15.6% of the time, which is a larger fraction than previously reported on the\nbasis of X-ray and past optical observations, and more frequently when the\ncompanion was at the superior conjunction of the orbit. A sinusoidal modulation\nat the binary orbital period was also present with an amplitude of ~16%, which\nvaried by a few percent over timescales of days, and with a maximum that took\nplace 890 +/- 85 s earlier than the superior conjunction of the donor. We\ninterpret these phenomena in terms of reprocessing of the X-ray emission by an\nasymmetrically heated companion star surface and/or a non-axisymmetric outflow\npossibly launched close to the inner Lagrangian point. Furthermore, the\nnon-flaring average emission varied by up to ~ 40% over a time scale of days in\nthe absence of correspondingly large variations of the irradiating X-ray flux.\nThe latter suggests that the observed changes in the average optical luminosity\nmight be due to variations of the geometry, size, and/or mass accretion rate in\nthe outer regions of the accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 11:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

For this, sensor nodes are\nattached with many sensors having ability to measure the environmental\ninformation. Spatial correlation between nodes exists in such wireless sensor\nnetwork based on common sensory coverage and then the redundant data\ncommunication is observed. To study virus spreading dynamics in such scenario,\na modified SI epidemic model is derived mathematically by incorporating WSN\nparameters such as spatial correlation, node density, sensing range,\ntransmission range, total sensor nodes etc. The solution for proposed SI model\nis also determined to study the dynamics with time. Initially, a small number\nof nodes are attacked by viruses and then virus infection propagates through\nits neighboring nodes over normal data communication. Since redundant nodes\nexists in correlated sensor field, virus spread process could be different with\ndifferent sensory coverage. The proposed SI model captures spatial and temporal\ndynamics than existing ones which are global. The infection process leads to\nnetwork failure. By exploiting spatial correlation between nodes, spread\ncontrol scheme is developed to limit the further infection in the network.\nNumerical result analysis is provided with comparison for validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 11:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

A\nsequential change detection procedure is proposed that partitions the sample\nspace into a finite number of bins, and monitors the number of samples falling\ninto each of these bins to detect the change. A test statistic that\napproximates the generalized likelihood ratio test is developed.

We concern ourselves with the\nprobability distribution of an RGG, which is crucial for studying its random\ntopology, properties (e.g., connectedness), or Shannon entropy as a measure of\nthe graph's topological uncertainty (or information content). Moreover, the\ndistribution is also relevant for determining average network performance or\ndesigning protocols. However, a major impediment in deducing the graph\ndistribution is that it requires the joint probability distribution of the\n$n(n-1)/2$ distances between $n$ nodes randomly distributed in a bounded\ndomain. As no such result exists in the literature, we make progress by\nobtaining the joint distribution of the distances between three nodes confined\nin a disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This enables the calculation of the probability\ndistribution and entropy of a three-node graph. For arbitrary $n$, we derive a\nseries of upper bounds on the graph entropy; in particular, the bound involving\nthe entropy of a three-node graph is tighter than the existing bound which\nassumes distances are independent. Finally, we provide numerical results on\ngraph connectedness and the tightness of the derived entropy bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 11:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

This storage\nsolution provides numerous advantages, which includes the ability to store\ndense information while achieving long-term stability.

In this\npaper, we aim to address this question by proposing a new storage solution that\nrelies upon molecular communication, and in particular bacterial nanonetworks.\nOur solution allows digitally encoded information to be stored into non-motile\nbacteria, which compose an archival architecture of clusters, and to be later\nretrieved by engineered motile bacteria, whenever reading operations are\nneeded. We conducted extensive simulations, in order to determine the\nreliability of data retrieval from non-motile storage clusters, placed at\ndifferent locations. Aiming to assess the feasibility of our solution, we have\nalso conducted wet lab experiments that show how bacteria nanonetworks can\neffectively retrieve a simple message, such as \"Hello World\", by conjugation\nwith non-motile bacteria, and finally mobilize towards a final point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 12:45:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 13:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

A novel method for the analysis of real-valued electromagnetic\nfield data is presented in this paper.

As anode filaments, we propose\nseveral scenarios including a Li4Ti5O12 (LTO)-composite coated SPCT\n(dip-and-dry deposition), a tin-coated SPCT (PVD deposition) as well as a bare\ntin wire. An electrolyte composite layer consisting of LiPF6 and polyethylene\noxide (PEO) is then deposited onto both the anode and cathode filament before\nthe battery assembly. By twisting the cathode filament and anode filament\ntogether using a customized jig, the batteries are then assembled. The\nopen-circuit voltage is found to be ~ 2.3 V for the battery using the LTO@SPCT\nanode, and ~3.3 V for the battery using the tin@SPCT anode and the tin wire\nanode.

In this paper, we construct, for the first time,\nthree new classes of dilaton black hole solutions in the presence of three\ntypes of nonlinear electrodynamics, namely Born-Infeld, Logarithmic and\nExponential nonlinear electrodynamics. All these solutions are asymptotically\n(A)dS and in the linear regime reduce to the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black\nholes in AdS spaces. We investigate physical properties and the causal\nstructure, as well as asymptotic behavior of the obtained solutions, and show\nthat depending on the values of the metric parameters, the singularity can be\ncovered by various horizons. Interestingly enough, we find that the coupling of\ndilaton field and nonlinear gauge field in the background of (A)dS spaces leads\nto a strange behaviour for the electric field. We observe that the electric\nfield is zero at singularity and increases smoothly until reaches a maximum\nvalue, then it decreases smoothly until goes to zero as $r\\rightarrow\\infty$.\nThe maximum value of the electric field increases with increasing the nonlinear\nparameter $\\beta$ or decreasing the dilaton coupling $\\alpha$ and is shifted to\nthe singularity in the absence of either dilaton field ($\\alpha=0$) or\nnonlinear gauge field ($\\beta\\rightarrow\\infty$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 14:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

From the point of view of analog\ncomputability, the existence of an effective way to obtain solutions of these\nsystems is essential. A pioneering model of analog computation is the General\nPurpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Shannon as a model of the\nDifferential Analyzer and improved by Pour-El, Lipshitz and Rubel, Costa and\nGra\\c{c}a and others. Its power is known to be characterized by the class of\ndifferentially algebraic functions, which includes the solutions of initial\nvalue problems for ordinary differential equations. We address one of the\nlimitations of this model, concerning the notion of approximability, a\ndesirable property in computation over continuous spaces that is however absent\nin the GPAC. In particular, the Shannon GPAC cannot be used to generate\nnon-differentially algebraic functions which can be approximately computed in\nother models of computation. We extend the class of data types using networks\nwith channels which carry information on a general complete metric space $X$;\nfor example $X=C(R,R)$, the class of continuous functions of one real (spatial)\nvariable. We consider the original modules in Shannon's construction\n(constants, adders, multipliers, integrators) and we add \\emph{(continuous or\ndiscrete) limit} modules which have one input and one output. We then define an\nL-GPAC to be a network built with $X$-stream channels and the above-mentioned\nmodules. This leads us to a framework in which the specifications of such\nanalog systems are given by fixed points of certain operators on continuous\ndata streams. We study these analog systems and their associated operators, and\nshow how some classically non-generable functions, such as the gamma function\nand the zeta function, can be captured with the L-GPAC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 10:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 09:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 12:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}
