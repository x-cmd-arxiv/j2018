Thanks to the multiwavelength photometry from the\nultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR), and MaNGA's integral field spectroscopy,\nwe are able to study this merger in a detailed way. We divide the whole merger\ninto the core and tail regions, and fit both the optical spectrum and the\nmulti-band spectral energy distribution (SED) to models to obtain the star\nformation properties for each region respectively. We find that the color\nexcess of stars in the galaxy $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$ measured with the multi-band SED\nfitting is consistent with that estimated both from the infrared excess (the\nratio of IR to UV flux) and from the slope of the UV continuum. Furthermore,\nthe reliability of the $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$ is examined with a set of mock SEDs,\nshowing that the dust attenuation of the stars can be well constrained by the\nUV-to-IR broadband SED fitting. The dust attenuation obtained from optical\ncontinuum $E(B-V)_s^{spec}$ is only about half of $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$. The ratio\nof the $E(B-V)_s^{spec}$ to the $E(B-V)_g$ obtained from the Balmer decrement\nis consistent with the local value (around 0.5). The difference between the\nresults from the UV-to-IR data and the optical data is consistent with the\npicture that younger stellar populations are attenuated by an extra dust\ncomponent from the birth clouds compared to older stellar populations which are\nonly attenuated by the diffuse dust. Both with the UV-to-IR SED fitting and the\nspectral fitting, we find that there is a starburst younger than 100~Myr in one\nof the two core regions, consistent with the scenario that the\ninteraction-induced gas inflow can enhance the star formation in the center of\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 16:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Its shocked\nejecta emits brightly in radio and X-rays. Its unshocked ejecta can be studied\nthrough infrared emission, the radio-active decay of $^{44}$Ti, and low\nfrequency free-free absorption due to cold gas internal to the shell. Free-free\nabsorption is affected by the mass, geometry, temperature, and ionisation\nconditions in the absorbing gas. Observations at the lowest radio frequencies\nconstrain a combination of these properties. We use LOFAR LBA observations at\n30-77 MHz and L-band VLA observations to compare $u-v$-matched images with a\ncommon resolution of 17\". We simultaneously fit, per pixel, for the emission\nmeasure and the ratio of the emission from the unabsorbed front of the shell\nversus the absorbed back of the shell. We explore the effects that low\ntemperatures and a high degree of clumping can have on the derived physical\nproperties, such as mass and density. We also compile published radio flux\nmeasurements, fit for the absorption processes that occur in the radio band,\nand consider how they affect the secular decline of the source.

We also find that a decrease in the amount of mass in the\nunshocked ejecta (as more and more material meets the reverse shock and heats\nup) cannot account for the observed low frequency behaviour of the secular\ndecline rate. To reconcile our low frequency absorption measurements with\nmodels that predict little mass in the unshocked ejecta we need the ejecta to\nbe very clumped, or the temperature in the cold gas to be low ($\\sim10$ K).\nBoth conditions can jointly contribute to the high absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 17:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 21:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

However, static analysis\ncode itself is also prone to bugs. To ensure a consistent level of precision,\nas analyzed programs grow more complex, a static analysis has to handle more\ncode constructs, frameworks, and libraries that the programs use. While more\ncomplex analyses are written and used in production systems every day, the cost\nof debugging and fixing them also increases tremendously.\n  To better understand the difficulties of debugging static analyses, we\nsurveyed 115 static analysis writers. From their responses, we extracted the\ncore requirements to build a debugger for static analysis, which revolve around\ntwo main issues: (1) abstracting from two code bases at the same time (the\nanalysis code and the analyzed code) and (2) tracking the analysis internal\nstate throughout both code bases. Most current debugging tools that our survey\nparticipants use lack the capabilities to address both issues.\n  Focusing on those requirements, we introduce VisuFlow, a debugging\nenvironment for static data-flow analysis that is integrated in the Eclipse\ndevelopment environment. VisuFlow features graph visualizations that enable\nusers to view the state of a data-flow analysis and its intermediate results at\nany time. Special breakpoints in VisuFlow help users step through the analysis\ncode and the analyzed simultaneously. To evaluate the usefulness of VisuFlow,\nwe have conducted a user study on 20 static analysis writers. Using VisuFlow\nhelped our sample of analysis writers identify 25% and fix 50% more errors in\nthe analysis code compared to using the standard Eclipse debugging environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 18:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

Accordingly, few computational approaches have been\ndeveloped for making quantitative predictions of binding probabilities in\nenvironments other than dilute isotropic solution. Existing techniques, ranging\nfrom simple automated docking procedures to sophisticated thermodynamics-based\nmethods, have been developed with soluble proteins in mind. Biologically and\npharmacologically relevant protein-ligand interactions often occur in complex\nenvironments, including lamellar phases like membranes and crowded, non-dilute\nsolutions. Here we revisit the theoretical bases of ligand binding equilibria,\navoiding overly specific assumptions that are nearly always made when\ndescribing receptor-ligand binding. Building on this formalism, we extend the\nasymptotically exact Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation technique to\nquantifying occupancies of sites on proteins in a complex bulk, including\nphase-separated, anisotropic, or non-dilute solutions, using a\nthermodynamically consistent and easily generalized approach that resolves\nseveral ambiguities of current frameworks.

Two\npossible parametrizations (three neutrino masses versus the lightest neutrino\nmass plus the two oscillation mass splittings) and priors (linear versus\nlogarithmic) are examined. We find that the preference for NO is only driven by\nneutrino oscillation data. Moreover, the values of the Bayes factor indicate\nthat the evidence for NO is strong only when the scan is performed over the\nthree neutrino masses with logarithmic priors; for every other combination of\nparameterization and prior, the preference for NO is only weak. As a by-product\nof our Bayesian analyses, we are able to a) compare the Bayesian bounds on the\nneutrino mixing parameters to those obtained by means of frequentist\napproaches, finding a very good agreement; b) determine that the lightest\nneutrino mass plus the two mass splittings parametrization, motivated by the\nphysical observables, is strongly preferred over the three neutrino mass\neigenstates scan and c) find that there is a weak-to-moderate preference for\nlogarithmic priors. These results establish the optimal strategy to\nsuccessfully explore the neutrino parameter space, based on the use of the\noscillation mass splittings and a logarithmic prior on the lightest neutrino\nmass.

While\nall the effects in RSD are accounted for by the simple mapping formula from\nreal to redshift spaces, accurately modeling redshift-space power spectrum is\nrather difficult due to the non-perturbative properties of the mapping. Still,\nhowever, a perturbative treatment may be applied to the power spectrum at\nlarge-scales, and on top of a careful modeling of the Finger-of-God effect\ncaused by the small-scale random motion, the redshift-space power spectrum can\nbe expressed as a series of expansion which contains the higher-order\ncorrelations of density and velocity fields. In our previous work [JCAP 8\n(Aug., 2016) 050], we provide a perturbation-theory inspired model for power\nspectrum in which the higher-order correlations are evaluated directly from the\ncosmological $N$-body simulations.

It introduces\nobfuscation by inserting some extra hardware into a design to hide its\nfunctionality from unauthorized users. Correct functionality of an encrypted\ndesign depends upon the application of correct keys, shared only with the\nauthorized users. In the recent past, extensive efforts have been devoted in\nextracting the secret key of an encrypted design. At the same time, several\ncountermeasures have also been proposed by the research community to thwart\ndifferent state-of-the-art attacks on logic encryption. However, most of the\nproposed countermeasures fail to prevent the powerful SAT attack. Although a\nfew researchers have proposed different solutions to withstand SAT attack,\nthose solutions suffer from several drawbacks such as high design overheads,\nlow output corruptibility, and vulnerability against removal attack. Almost all\nthe known logic encryption strategies are vulnerable to scan based attack. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel encryption technique called Encrypt Flip-Flop,\nwhich encrypts the outputs of selected flip-flops by inserting multiplexers\n(MUX). The proposed strategy can thwart all the known attacks including SAT and\nscan based attacks. The scheme has low design overhead and implementation\ncomplexity.

The method can thus evaluate critical\ntransistor parameters and help to screen out low performance wafers before the\nactual fabrication. To this end, we use a simple optical spectroscopy at room\ntemperature that measures the surface photovoltage band-edge responses in the\nheterostructure and uses a model that takes into account the effect of the\nbuilt-in electric fields on optical absorption in the layers and\nheterojunctions to evaluate bandgaps, band offsets, and built-in fields.

In the last\ndecade the use of Machine Learning and more specifically classification methods\nhave proved to be successful to create this semantic information.

We found Westin's typology to be a useful starting point for\nunderstanding privacy attitudes and concerns in this demographic. We expand\nWestin's typology and distinguish five categories: fundamentalist, intense\npragmatist, relaxed pragmatist, marginally concerned, and cynical expert.

The first section provides a brief history of\nempirical observations on toxicity dating back to the dawn of Sumerian\ncivilization. Interestingly, the concept of dose emerged very early on, leading\nup to the modern emphasis on kinetic properties, which in turn encodes the\ninsight that toxicity is not solely a property of a compound but instead\ndepends on the interaction with the host organism. The next logical step is the\ncurrent conception of evaluating drugs from a personalized medicine\npoint-of-view. We review recent work on integrating what could be referred to\nas classical pharmacokinetic analysis with emerging systems biology approaches\nincorporating multiple omics data. These systems approaches employ advanced\nstatistical analytical data processing complemented with machine learning\ntechniques and use both pharmacokinetic and omics data. We find that such\nintegrated approaches not only provide improved predictions of toxicity but\nalso enable mechanistic interpretations of the molecular mechanisms\nunderpinning toxicity and drug resistance. We conclude the chapter by\ndiscussing some of the main challenges, such as how to balance the inherent\ntension between the predictive capacity of models, which in practice amounts to\nconstraining the number of features in the models versus allowing for rich\nmechanistic interpretability, i.e. equipping models with numerous molecular\nfeatures. This challenge also requires patient-specific predictions on\ntoxicity, which in turn requires proper stratification of patients as regards\nhow they respond, with or without adverse toxic effects. In summary, the\ntransformation of the ancient concept of dose is currently successfully\noperationalized using rich integrative data encoded in patient-specific models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 22:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Here, we analytically\nstudy an arbitrarily-shaped isotropic inhomogeneity embedded in a finite-sized\nheterogeneous medium. By modal decomposition of the influence of the\ninhomogeneity on the deformation of the composite, a relation is presented that\ndetermines the variation of effective elastic stiffness caused by the presence\nof the inhomogeneity. This relation indicates that the effective elastic\nstiffness of a composite is always a concave function of the properties of the\ninhomogeneity, embedded inside the composite. Therefore, as the heterogeneity\nof elastic random composites increases, the rate of increase in effective\nstiffness caused by the stiffer constituents is smaller than the rate of its\ndecrease due to the softer constitutions. So, weakly heterogeneous random\ncomposites become softer and less conductive with increasing heterogeneity at\nthe same mean of constituent properties. We numerically evaluated the effective\nproperties of about ten thousand composites to empirically support these\nresults and extend them to conductive materials.

Analysis of the magnetic\nrelaxation data using Maley's criterion and the collective pinning theory\nsuggests that the second magnetization peak (SMP) in the sample is due to the\ncollective (elastic) to plastic creep crossover, which is also accompanied with\na rhombic to square vortex lattice phase transition. Analysis of the pinning\nforce density suggests single dominating pinning mechanism in the sample and is\nnot showing the usual $\\delta$l and $\\delta T_c$ nature of pinning. The\ncritical current density ($J_c$) estimated using the Bean's critical state\nmodel is found to be 5 $\\times$ 10$^5$ A/cm$^2$ at 2 K in the zero magnetic\nfield limit. Surprisingly, the maximum in the pinning force density is not\nresponsible for the maximum value of the critical current density in the\nsample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 00:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

We demonstrate a non-cascaded approach to\nperform arbitrary unitary and non-unitary linear operations for N-dimensional\nphase-coherent spatial modes with meticulously designed phase gratings.

For the non-unitary\noperators, a matrix is presented for the tomography of a 4-level quantum system\nwith a fidelity of 94.9%. Thus, the linear operator has been successfully\nimplemented with much higher dimensionality than that in previous reports.

Of\nparticular interest is to establish a relationship between the VIV, the gap\nflow and the near-wake instability behind bluff bodies. We find that the\nkinematics of the VIV regulates the streamwise vorticity concentration, which\naccompanies with a recovery of two-dimensional hydrodynamic responses at the\npeak lock-in stage. On the other hand, the near-wake instability may develop\naround an in-determinant two-dimensional streamline saddle point along the\ninterfaces of a pair of imbalanced counter-signed vorticity clusters. The\nvorticity concentration difference of adjacent vorticity clusters and the fluid\nmomentum are closely interlinked with the prominence of streamwise vortical\nstructures. In both SSBS and VSBS arrangements, the flip-flopping frequency is\nsignificantly low for the three-dimensional flow, except at the VIV lock-in\nstage for the VSBS arrangement. A quasi-stable deflected gap flow regime with\nnegligible spanwise hydrodynamic (i.e., two-dimensional) response is found at\nthe peak lock-in stage of VSBS arrangements. Owing to the gap-flow proximity\ninterference, a high streamwise vorticity concentration is observed in its\nnarrow near-wake region.

It is worth noting that the four assumptions may\nnot be satisfied in the whole region.

However,\nconstraint-free natural image reconstruction from brain activity is still a\nchallenge. The existing methods simplified the problem by using semantic prior\ninformation or just reconstructing simple images such as letters and digitals.\nWithout semantic prior information, we present a novel method to reconstruct\nnature images from fMRI signals of human visual cortex based on the computation\nmodel of convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, we extracted the units\noutput of viewed natural images in each layer of a pre-trained CNN as CNN\nfeatures. Secondly, we transformed image reconstruction from fMRI signals into\nthe problem of CNN feature visualizations by training a sparse linear\nregression to map from the fMRI patterns to CNN features. By iteratively\noptimization to find the matched image, whose CNN unit features become most\nsimilar to those predicted from the brain activity, we finally achieved the\npromising results for the challenging constraint-free natural image\nreconstruction. As there was no use of semantic prior information of the\nstimuli when training decoding model, any category of images (not constraint by\nthe training set) could be reconstructed theoretically. We found that the\nreconstructed images resembled the natural stimuli, especially in position and\nshape. The experimental results suggest that hierarchical visual features can\neffectively express the visual perception process of human brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 08:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

In ordered systems, some phonons characterized by\ndifferent wavevectors are degenerate, i.e. they share the same frequency\n$\\omega$; in finite-size systems, phonons form a discrete set of bands with\n$n_q(\\omega)$-fold degeneracy. Here we focus on understanding how this\ndegeneracy is lifted in the presence of disorder, and its physical\nimplications. Using standard degenerate perturbation theory and simple\nstatistical considerations, we predict the dependence of the disorder-induced\nfrequency width of phonon bands to be\n$\\Delta\\omega\\!\\sim\\!\\sigma\\,\\omega\\sqrt{n_q}/\\sqrt{N}$, where $\\sigma$ is the\nstrength of disorder and $N$ is the total number of particles. This theoretical\nprediction is supported by extensive numerical calculations for disordered\nlattices characterized by topological, mass, stiffness and positional disorder,\nand for computer glasses, where disorder is self-generated, thus establishing\nits universal nature. The predicted scaling leads to the identification of a\ncrossover frequency $\\omega_\\dagger\\!\\sim\\!L^{-2/(d+2)}$ in systems of linear\nsize $L$ in $d\\!>\\!2$ dimensions, where the disorder-induced width of phonon\nbands becomes comparable to the frequency gap between neighboring bands.\nConsequently, phonons continuously cover the frequency range\n$\\omega\\!>\\!\\omega_\\dagger$, where the notion of discrete phonon bands becomes\nill-defined. Two basic applications of the theory are presented; first, we show\nthat the phonon scattering lifetime is proportional to $(\\Delta\\omega)^{-1}$\nfor $\\omega\\!<\\!\\omega_\\dagger$.

The motivation for\nstudying this pressing problem originates from the fact that the classical\nnumerical tools used to solve low-dimensional optimal control problems are\ncomputationally infeasible for large-scale systems. Furthermore, although the\nmatrices of large-scale FE or FD models are usually sparse banded or highly\nstructured, the optimal control solution computed using the classical methods\nis dense and unstructured. Consequently, it is not suitable for efficient\ncentralized and distributed real-time implementations. We show that the a\npriori (sparsity) patterns of the exact solutions of the generalized Lyapunov\nequations for FE and FD models are banded matrices. The a priori pattern\npredicts the dominant non-zero entries of the exact solution. We furthermore\nshow that for well-conditioned problems, the a priori patterns are not only\nbanded but also sparse matrices. On the basis of these results, we develop two\ncomputationally efficient methods for computing sparse approximate solutions of\ngeneralized Lyapunov equations. Using these two methods and the inexact Newton\nmethod, we show that the solution of the generalized Riccati equation can be\napproximated by a banded matrix. This enables us to develop a novel\ncomputationally efficient optimal control approach that is able to preserve the\nsparsity of the control law.

We configured an infrastructure to\nobserve all changes in these libraries and to detect breaking changes shortly\nafter their introduction in the code. After identifying breaking changes, we\nasked the developers to explain the reasons behind their decision to change the\nAPIs. During the study, we identified 59 breaking changes, confirmed by the\ndevelopers of 19 projects. By analyzing the developers' answers, we report that\nbreaking changes are mostly motivated by the need to implement new features, by\nthe desire to make the APIs simpler and with fewer elements, and to improve\nmaintainability. We conclude by providing suggestions to language designers,\ntool builders, software engineering researchers and API developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 10:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

There is a tradeoff\nbetween the coverage and overall throughput achievable, as interference\navoidance techniques lead to a loss in a cell's overall throughput, with\nspectrum efficiency decreasing with the fencing off of orthogonal resources. In\nthis paper we propose MANN, a dynamic multiagent frequency reuse scheme, where\nindividual agents in charge of cells control their configurations based on\ninput from neural networks. The agents' decisions are partially influenced by a\ncoordinator agent, which attempts to maximise a global metric of the network\n(e.g., cell-edge performance).

Due to their continuous nature, queries on\ndata-streams can be more complex, and distinctly harder to understand then\ndatabase queries. As users have to consider operational details, maintenance\nand debugging become challenging. Current approaches model data-streams as\nsequences, be- cause this is the way they are physically received. These models\nresult in an implementation-focused perspective. We explore an alternate way of\nmodeling data-streams by focusing on time-slicing semantics.

By adapting the definitions of relevant concepts in stream\nprocessing to our model, we illustrate the practical useful- ness of our\napproach.

The formulas for calculating the angular momentum of\ntwo colliding condensations with respect to their center of mass, which were\napplied earlier in (Ipatov, 2010) in the comparison of such momenta with the\nangular momenta of observed satellite systems, are used to estimate the angular\nmomenta of condensations needed to form satellite systems. It is demonstrated\nthat the angular velocities of condensations used in (Nesvorny et al., 2010) as\nthe initial data in the computer simulation of compression of rarefied\npreplanetesimals and subsequent formation of trans-Neptunian satellite systems\nmay be obtained in collisions of preplanetesimals with their radii comparable\nto the corresponding Hill radii. For example, these angular velocities are in\nthe range of possible values of angular velocities of a parental rarefied\npreplanetesimal formed as a result of a merger of two colliding rarefied\npreplanetesimals that moved in circular heliocentric orbits before a collision.\nSome rarefied preplanetesimals formed as a result of collision of\npreplanetesimals in the region of formation of solid small bodies acquire such\nangular momenta that are sufficient to form satellite systems of small bodies.\nIt is likely that the ratio of the number of rarefied preplanetesimals with\nsuch angular momenta to the total number of rarefied preplanetesimals producing\nclassical trans-Neptunian objects with diameters larger than 100 km was 0.45\n(the initial fraction of satellite systems among all classical trans-Neptunian\nobjects).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 11:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

One\nof the method to compress CNNs is compressing the layers iteratively, i.e. by\nlayer-by-layer compression and fine-tuning, with CP-decomposition in\nconvolutional layers. To compress with CP-decomposition, rank selection is\nimportant. In the previous approach rank selection that is based on sensitivity\nof each layer, the average rank of the network was still arbitrarily selected.\nAdditionally, the rank of all layers were decided before whole process of\niterative compression, while the rank of a layer can be changed after\nfine-tuning.

The points of view evaluated by these indices are\nnaturally interacting: thus, a bonus has to be recognized to units performing\nwell on synergic criteria, whereas a penalization has to be assigned on\nredundant criteria. An additional difficulty of the modelization is the\nelicitation of the parameters for the composite indices, since they are\ntypically affected by some imprecision. In most approaches, all these critical\npoints are usually neglected, which in turn yields an unpleasant degree of\napproximation in the computation of indices.

Constructing a large-scale quantum\nprocessor, however, is challenging due to errors and noise inherent in\nreal-world quantum systems. One approach to this challenge is to utilize\nmodularity--a pervasive strategy found throughout nature and engineering--to\nbuild complex systems robustly. Such an approach manages complexity and\nuncertainty by assembling small, specialized components into a larger\narchitecture. These considerations motivate the development of a quantum\nmodular architecture, where separate quantum systems are combined via\ncommunication channels into a quantum network. In this architecture, an\nessential tool for universal quantum computation is the teleportation of an\nentangling quantum gate, a technique originally proposed in 1999 which, until\nnow, has not been realized deterministically. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate a teleported controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation made deterministic by\nutilizing real-time adaptive control. Additionally, we take a crucial step\ntowards implementing robust, error-correctable modules by enacting the gate\nbetween logical qubits, encoding quantum information redundantly in the states\nof superconducting cavities. Such teleported operations have significant\nimplications for fault-tolerant quantum computation, and when realized within a\nnetwork can have broad applications in quantum communication, metrology, and\nsimulations. Our results illustrate a compelling approach for implementing\nmulti-qubit operations on logical qubits within an error-protected quantum\nmodular architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 15:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

This task is\ndifficult due to the large differences in image contrast and resolution, as\nwell as the complex nonrigid distortions produced when sectioning the sample\nand mounting it on the glass slide. It has been shown in brain MRI registration\nthat better spatial alignment across modalities can be obtained by synthesizing\none modality from the other and then using intra-modality registration metrics,\nrather than by using mutual information (MI) as metric. However, such an\napproach typically requires a database of aligned images from the two\nmodalities, which is very difficult to obtain for histology/MRI.\n  Here, we overcome this limitation with a probabilistic method that\nsimultaneously solves for registration and synthesis directly on the target\nimages, without any training data. In our model, the MRI slice is assumed to be\na contrast-warped, spatially deformed version of the histological section. We\nuse approximate Bayesian inference to iteratively refine the probabilistic\nestimate of the synthesis and the registration, while accounting for each\nother's uncertainty. Moreover, manually placed landmarks can be seamlessly\nintegrated in the framework for increased performance.\n  Experiments on a synthetic dataset show that, compared with MI, the proposed\nmethod makes it possible to use a much more flexible deformation model in the\nregistration to improve its accuracy, without compromising robustness.\nMoreover, our framework also exploits information in manually placed landmarks\nmore efficiently than MI, since landmarks inform both synthesis and\nregistration - as opposed to registration alone. Finally, we show qualitative\nresults on the public Allen atlas, in which the proposed method provides a\nclear improvement over MI based registration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 15:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

One basic form for representing stateful rules is\ndeterministic finite automata (DFA). Previous research shows that extracting\nDFAs from trained second-order recurrent networks is not only possible but also\nrelatively stable. Recently, several new types of recurrent networks with more\ncomplicated architectures have been introduced. These handle challenging\nlearning tasks usually involving sequential data. However, it remains an open\nproblem whether DFAs can be adequately extracted from these models.\nSpecifically, it is not clear how DFA extraction will be affected when applied\nto different recurrent networks trained on data sets with different levels of\ncomplexity. Here, we investigate DFA extraction on several widely adopted\nrecurrent networks that are trained to learn a set of seven regular Tomita\ngrammars. We first formally analyze the complexity of Tomita grammars and\ncategorize these grammars according to that complexity. Then we empirically\nevaluate different recurrent networks for their performance of DFA extraction\non all Tomita grammars.

Besides, it has been proven that the\nquantum theory has powerful capabilities of solving the decision making\nproblems, especially for modelling human decision and cognition. However, the\nclassical Dempster-Shafer evidence theory modelled by real numbers cannot be\nintegrated directly with the quantum theory modelled by complex numbers. So,\nhow can we establish a bridge of communications between the classical\nDempster-Shafer evidence theory and the quantum theory? To answer this\nquestion, a generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is proposed in this\npaper. The main contribution in this study is that, unlike the existing\nevidence theory, a mass function in the generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence\ntheory is modelled by a complex number, called as a complex mass function. In\naddition, compared with the classical Dempster's combination rule, the\ncondition in terms of the conflict coefficient between two evidences K < 1 is\nreleased in the generalized Dempster's combination rule so that it is more\ngeneral and applicable than the classical Dempster's combination rule. When the\ncomplex mass function is degenerated from complex numbers to real numbers, the\ngeneralized Dempster's combination rule degenerates to the classical evidence\ntheory under the condition that the conflict coefficient between the evidences\nK is less than 1. Numerical examples are illustrated to show the efficiency of\nthe generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.

In\nIB-DUGKS, the IB method is used to treat the fluid-solid interfaces and the\nDUGKS is applied to simulate the fluid flow, making use of the Lagrangian and\nEulerian meshes, respectively. Those two meshes are fully independent, which\ncontributes to the avoidance of grid regeneration when a solid particle moves.\nSpecifically, in the present implementation of IB-DUGKS, the no-slip boundary\ncondition at the particle surface is accurately enforced by introducing an\nefficient iterative forcing algorithm, and the IB force induced by the particle\nboundary is conveniently incorporated into the DUGKS with the Strange-Splitting\nscheme.

Due\nto the use of full RNS Montgomery algorithms, the system does not involve any\ncarries, therefore cryptographic attacks that exploit carries cannot be\napplied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 21:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

This\nmathematical problem is motivated by several practical applications such as\nheat transport in composite materials, flow in layered aquifers and drug\ndiffusion through the layers of the skin. In such processes, the physical\nproperties of the medium vary across layers and internal boundary conditions\napply at the interfaces between adjacent layers. To characterise the timescale,\nwe use the concept of mean action time, which provides the mean timescale at\neach position in the medium by utilising the fact that the transition of the\ntransient solution of the underlying partial differential equation model, from\ninitial state to steady state, can be represented as a cumulative distribution\nfunction of time. Using this concept, we define the characteristic timescale\nfor a multilayer diffusion process as the maximum value of the mean action time\nacross the layered medium. For given initial conditions and internal and\nexternal boundary conditions, this approach leads to simple algebraic\nexpressions for characterising the timescale that depend on the physical and\ngeometrical properties of the medium, such as the diffusivities and lengths of\nthe layers. Numerical examples demonstrate that these expressions provide\nuseful insight into explaining how the parameters in the model affect the time\nit takes for a multilayer diffusion process to reach steady state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 05:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 01:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-13"}

As a next step, still working on the\nsimplified model, out-of-plane deformations are taken into account and the\nequations complicate dramatically. We describe how wrinkling/buckling can be\nintroduced into the model and apply the Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem to get\nexistence and uniqueness in terms of the shift vector for some characteristic\ncases.

The\nwaves have several types (e.g., a, b, g, q, d) in response to different levels\nof consciousness. They are classified into two groups: Group-1 consists of\ncomplex storm-like waves (a, b, and g); Group-2 is composed of simple\nquasilinear waves (q and d). In order to elucidate the mechanism of EEG wave\nformation and propagation, this paper extends the Vlasov-Maxwell equations of\nPlasma Brain Dynamics (PBD) to a set of two-fluid, self-similar, nonlinear\nsolitary wave equations. Numerical simulations are performed for different EEG\nsignals. Main results include: (1) The excitation and propagation of the EEG\nwave packets are dependent of electric and magnetic fields, brain aqua-ions,\nelectron and ion temperatures, masses, and their initial fluid speeds; (2)\nGroup-1 complex waves contain three ingredients: the high-frequency\nion-acoustic (IA) mode, the intermediate-frequency lower-hybrid (LH) mode, and\nthe low-frequency ion-cyclotron (IC) mode; (3) Group-2 simple waves fall within\nthe IA band, featured by one or a combination of the three envelopes:\nsinusoidal, sawtooth, and spiky/bipolar. The study proposes an alternative\nmodel to Quantum Brain Dynamics (QBD) by suggesting that the formation and\npropagation of the nonlinear solitary EEG waves in the brain have the same\nmechanism as that of the waves in space plasmas\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 01:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}
