Recently, it was experimentally observed that under certain\nconditions graphene can self-drive its tearing and peeling from substrates.\nThis process can generate long, micrometer sized, folded nanoribbons without\nthe action of any external forces. Also, during this cracking-like propagation\nprocess, the width of the graphene folded ribbon continuously decreases and the\nprocess only stops when the width reaches about few hundreds nanometers in\nsize. It is believed that interplay between the strain energy of folded\nregions, breaking of carbon-carbon covalent bonds, and adhesion of\ngraphene-graphene and graphene-substrate are the most fundamental features of\nthis process, although the detailed mechanisms at atomic scale remain unclear.\nIn order to gain further insights on these processes we carried out fully\natomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations using the AIREBO potential as\navailable in the LAMMPS computational package. Although the reported\ntearing/peeling experimental observations were only to micrometer sized\nstructures, our results showed that they could also occur at nanometer scale.\nOur preliminary results suggest that the graphene tearing/peeling process\noriginates from thermal energy fluctuations that results in broken bonds,\nfollowed by strain release that creates a local elastic wave that can either\nreinforce the process, similar to a whip cracking propagation, or undermine it\nby producing carbon dangling bonds that evolve to the formation of bonds\nbetween the two layers of graphene. As the process continues in time and the\nfolded graphene decreases in width, the carbon-carbon bonds at the ribbon edge\nand interlayer bonds get less stressed, thermal fluctuations become unable to\nbreak them and the process stops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 16:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

We consider the case where\ntwo types of sensors are deployed: the first consists of expensive, high\nquality sensors; and the second, of cheap low quality sensors, which are\nactivated only if the intensity of the spatial field exceeds a pre-defined\nactivation threshold (eg. wind sensors). In addition, these sensors are powered\nby means of energy harvesting and their time varying energy status impacts on\nthe accuracy of the measurement that may be obtained. We account for this\nphenomenon by encoding the energy harvesting process into the second moment\nproperties of the additive noise, resulting in a spatial heteroscedastic\nprocess. We then address the following two important problems: (i) how to\nefficiently perform spatial field reconstruction based on measurements obtained\nsimultaneously from both networks; and (ii) how to perform query based sensor\nset selection with predictive MSE performance guarantee. We first show that the\nresulting predictive posterior distribution, which is key in fusing such\ndisparate observations, involves solving intractable integrals. To overcome\nthis problem, we solve the first problem by developing a low complexity\nalgorithm based on the spatial best linear unbiased estimator (S-BLUE). Next,\nbuilding on the S-BLUE, we address the second problem, and develop an efficient\nalgorithm for query based sensor set selection with performance guarantee. Our\nalgorithm is based on the Cross Entropy method which solves the combinatorial\noptimization problem in an efficient manner. We present a comprehensive study\nof the performance gain that can be obtained by augmenting the high-quality\nsensors with low-quality sensors using both synthetic and real insurance storm\nsurge database known as the Extreme Wind Storms Catalogue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 16:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

We map the\ntransition of authors between communities of different sizes from 1970 to 2013,\ncapturing their birth, growth, merger and collapse. We find that Indian-Foreign\ncollaborations are increasing at a faster pace compared to the Indian-Indian.\nWe observe that the degree distribution of Indian collaboration networks\nfollows the power law, with distinct patterns between Physical Review A, B and\nE, and high energy physics journals Physical Review C and D, and Physical\nReview Letters. In almost every measure, we observe strong structural\ndifferences between low-energy and high-energy physics journals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 18:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

In this paper, we present a robust optimization approach to optimize\nboth the location and routing of emergency response vehicles, accounting for\nuncertainty in travel times and spatial demand characteristic of LMICs. We\ntraveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, the sixth largest and third most densely\npopulated city in the world, to conduct field research resulting in the\ncollection of two unique datasets that inform our approach. This data is\nleveraged to develop machine learning methodologies to estimate demand for\nemergency medical services in a LMIC setting and to predict the travel time\nbetween any two locations in the road network for different times of day and\ndays of the week. We combine our robust optimization and machine learning\nframeworks with real data to provide an in-depth investigation into three\npolicy-related questions. First, we demonstrate that outpost locations\noptimized for weekday rush hour lead to good performance for all times of day\nand days of the week. Second, we find that significant improvements in\nemergency response times can be achieved by re-locating a small number of\noutposts and that the performance of the current system could be replicated\nusing only 30% of the resources. Lastly, we show that a fleet of small\nmotorcycle-based ambulances has the potential to significantly outperform\ntraditional ambulance vans. In particular, they are able to capture three times\nmore demand while reducing the median response time by 42% due to increased\nrouting flexibility offered by nimble vehicles on a larger road network. Our\nresults provide practical insights for emergency response optimization that can\nbe leveraged by hospital-based and private ambulance providers in Dhaka and\nother urban centers in LMICs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 18:38:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 23:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

These disks have low scattering albedos of 10% and 13%\nrespectively, inconsistent with water ice grain compositions. They are\nreminiscent of several other disks with similar inclination and scattering\nalbedos: Fomalhaut, HD 92945, HD 202628, and HD 207129. They are also very\ndistinct from brighter disks in the same inclination bin, which point to\ndifferent compositions between these two populations. Varying scattering albedo\nvalues can be explained by different grain porosities, chemical compositions,\nor grain size distributions, which may indicate distinct formation mechanisms\nor dynamical processes at work in these systems. Finally, these faint disks\nwith large infrared excesses may be representative of an underlying population\nof systems with low albedo values. Searches with more sensitive instruments on\nHST or on the James Webb Space Telescope and using state-of-the art\nstarlight-subtraction methods may help discover more of such faint systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

We present an analytic determination of the star formation\nrate (SFR) in a gravoturbulent medium based on the density probability\ndistribution function of molecular clouds having a piecewise lognormal and\npower law form. This is in contrast to previous analytic SFR models that are\ngoverned primarily by interstellar turbulence which sets purely lognormal\ndensity PDFs. In the gravoturbulent SFR model described herein, low density gas\nresides in the lognormal portion of the PDF. Gas becomes gravitationally\nunstable past a critical density ($\\rho_{crit}$), and the PDF begins to forms a\npower law. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the transitional density\n($\\rho_t$) between the lognormal and power law portions of the PDF moves\ntowards lower-density while the slope of the power law ($\\alpha$) becomes\nincreasingly shallow. The star formation rate per free-fall time is calculated\nvia an integral over the lognormal from $\\rho_{crit}$ to $\\rho_t$ and an\nintegral over the power law from $\\rho_t$ to the maximum density. As $\\alpha$\nbecomes shallower the SFR accelerates beyond the expected values calculated\nfrom a lognormal density PDF. We show that the star formation efficiency per\nfree fall time in observations of local molecular cloud increases with\nshallower PDF power law slopes, in agreement with our model. Our model can\nexplain why star formation is spatially and temporally variable within a cloud\nand why the depletion times observed in local and extragalactic giant molecular\nclouds vary.

Thus, we provide strong numerical evidence that\nthe Weyl Fermi-arcs are not topologically protected from disorder. Nonetheless,\nthe surface chiral velocity is robust and survives in the presence of strong\ndisorder, persisting all the way to the Anderson-localized phase by forming\nlocalized current loops that live within the localization length of the\nsurface.

We review\nthe various mechanisms proposed for the origin of water on the terrestrial\nplanets. Various in-situ mechanisms have been suggested, which allow for the\nincorporation of water into the local planetesimals in the terrestrial planet\nregion or into the planets themselves from local sources, although all of those\nmechanisms have difficulties. Comets have also been proposed as a source,\nalthough there may be problems fitting isotopic constraints, and the delivery\nefficiency is very low, such that it may be difficult to deliver even a single\nEarth ocean of water this way. The most promising route for water delivery is\nthe accretion of material from beyond the snow line, similar to carbonaceous\nchondrites, that is scattered into the terrestrial planet region as the planets\nare growing. Two main scenarios are discussed in detail. First is the classical\nscenario in which the giant planets begin roughly in their final locations and\nthe disk of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region extends\nall the way into the outer asteroid belt region. Second is the Grand Tack\nscenario, where early inward and outward migration of the giant planets\nimplants material from beyond the snow line into the asteroid belt and\nterrestrial planet region, where it can be accreted by the growing planets.\nSufficient water is delivered to the terrestrial planets in both scenarios.\nWhile the Grand Tack scenario provides a better fit to most constraints, namely\nthe small mass of Mars, planets may form too fast in the nominal case discussed\nhere. This discrepancy may be reduced as a wider range of initial conditions is\nexplored. Finally, we discuss several more recent models that may have\nimportant implications for water delivery to the terrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:25:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2018 01:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

In\nnetworked systems, both digital and biological, each component receives inputs,\nperforms a simple computation, and creates an output. When these components\nhave multiple outputs, we intuitively assume that the outputs are causally\ndependent on the inputs but are themselves independent of each other given the\nstate of their shared input. However, this intuition can be violated for\ncomponents with probabilistic logic, as these typically cannot be decomposed\ninto separate logic gates with one output each. This violation of conditional\nindependence on the past system state is equivalent to instantaneous\ninteraction --- the idea is that some information between the outputs is not\ncoming from the inputs and thus must have been created instantaneously.

The current work is thus motivated to\ninvestigate the bouncing solutions in modified gravity theories when the\nbackground universe is described by the spatially flat\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry. We show that the simplest\nway to obtain the bouncing cosmologies in such spacetime is to consider some\nkind of Lagrangians whose gravitational sector depends only on the square of\nthe Hubble parameter of the FLRW universe.

In this paper, we\nfocus on the problem of channel estimation in massive MIMO systems, while\naddressing these two challenges: We jointly design the pilot sequences to\nmitigate the effect of pilot contamination and propose an analog combiner which\nmaps the high number of sensors to a low number of RF chains, thus reducing the\ncomputational and hardware cost.

Given the resulting combiner, we derive a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal pilot sequences in the fully-separable\ncase and suggest a greedy sum of ratio traces maximization (GSRTM) method for\ndesigning sub-optimal pilots in the partially-separable scenario.

Recently, researchers\nexperimentally demonstrated that the interplay between axial and permeate flow\nin a porous microchannel results in a wide range of focussing positions of\nfinite sized particles (Garcia & Pennathur 2017) . We numerically explore this\ninterplay by computing the lateral forces on a neutrally buoyant spherical\nparticle that is subject to both inertial and permeate forces over a range of\nexperimentally relevant particle sizes and channel Reynolds numbers (Re).\nInterestingly, we show that the lateral forces on the particle is well\nrepresented using a linearised model across a range of permeate-to-axial flow\nrate ratios, $\\gamma$. Specifically, our model linearises the effects of the\npermeate flow, which suggests that the interplay between axial and permeate\nflow on the lateral force on a particle can be represented as a superposition\nbetween the lateral (inertial) forces in pure axial flow and the viscous forces\nin pure permeate flow. We experimentally validate this observation for a range\nof flow conditions. The linearised behaviour observed significantly reduces the\ncomplexity and time required to predict the migration of inertial particles in\npermeate channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 21:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 20:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In particular,\neach UAV aims at achieving a tradeoff between maximizing energy efficiency and\nminimizing both wireless latency and the interference level caused on the\nground network along its path. The problem is cast as a dynamic game among\nUAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on\necho state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN\narchitecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the\nnetwork state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of\ntime-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path,\ntransmission power level, and cell association vector at different locations\nalong its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash\nequilibrium (SPNE) upon convergence. Moreover, an upper and lower bound for the\naltitude of the UAVs is derived thus reducing the computational complexity of\nthe proposed algorithm.

Motivated by graph based\nMapReduce, we propose a coded computing framework that leverages computation\nredundancy to alleviate the communication bottleneck in distributed graph\nprocessing. We develop a novel 'coding' scheme that systematically injects\nstructured redundancy in computation phase to enable 'coded' multicasting\nopportunities during message exchange between servers, reducing communication\nload substantially in large-scale graph processing. For theoretical analysis,\nwe consider random graph models, and prove that our proposed scheme enables an\n(asymptotically) inverse-linear trade-off between 'computation load' and\n'average communication load' for two popular random graph models -- Erdos-Renyi\nmodel, and power law model. Particularly, for a given computation load r, (i.e.\nwhen each graph vertex is carefully stored at r servers), the proposed scheme\nslashes the average communication load by (nearly) a multiplicative factor of\nr. For the Erdos-Renyi model, our proposed scheme is optimal asymptotically as\nthe graph size increases by providing an information-theoretic converse. To\nillustrate the benefits of our scheme in practice, we implement PageRank over\nAmazon EC2, using artificial as well as real-world datasets, demonstrating\nsignificant gains over conventional PageRank.

Existing grade pre- diction methods mostly\nfocus on modeling the knowledge components associated with each course and\nstudent, and often overlook other factors such as the difficulty of each\nknowledge component, course instructors, student interest, capabilities and\neffort. In this paper, we propose additive latent effect models that\nincorporate these factors to predict the student next-term grades.\nSpecifically, the proposed models take into account four factors: (i) student's\nacademic level, (ii) course instructors, (iii) student global latent factor,\nand (iv) latent knowledge factors.

Mechanical\ncharacterization of metastable austenite is a critical component in accurately\ncapturing the micro-mechanical behavior under typical application loads.\nTraditional mechanical characterization techniques are unable to discretely\nquantify the micro-mechanical response of the austenite, and as a result, the\ncomputational predictions rely heavily on trial and error or qualitative\ndescriptions of the austenite phase.

In contrast to stacked GANs, where multiple stages of GANs are\ntrained separately with full supervision of labeled intermediate images, the\nFusedGAN has a single stage pipeline with a built-in stacking of GANs. Unlike\nexisting methods, which requires full supervision with paired conditions and\nimages, the FusedGAN can effectively leverage more abundant images without\ncorresponding conditions in training, to produce more diverse samples with high\nfidelity.

A major result is that the\ntotal tidal dissipation scales as square of the field strength, which can be\nused to estimate the strength of internal magnetic field in the astronomical\nobject of a binary system. Moreover, with a moderate or stronger field the\nratio of the magnetic dissipation to the viscous dissipation is almost\ninversely proportional to magnetic Prandtl number (i.e. the ratio of viscosity\nto magnetic diffusivity), and therefore in the astrophysical situation at small\nmagnetic Prandtl number magnetic dissipation dominates over viscous dissipation\nwith a moderate or stronger field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 05:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 05:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

Many of the developed systems still rely on the use\nof hand selected features for crop identification and often neglect the\nestimation of crop quantity and quality, which is key to assigning labor during\nfarming processes. To alleviate these limitations we present a robotic vision\nsystem that can accurately estimate the quantity and quality of sweet pepper\n(Capsicum annuum L), a key horticultural crop. This system consists of three\nparts: detection, quality estimation, and tracking. Efficient detection is\nachieved using the FasterRCNN framework.

Evaluation of these two techniques outlines the improved\nperformance of the parallel layer, where we achieve an F1 score of 77.3 for the\nparallel technique yet only 72.5 for the best scoring (red) of the multi-class\nimplementation. To track the crop we present a tracking via detection approach,\nwhich uses the FasterRCNN with parallel layers, that is also a vision-only\nsolution.

It features an explicit\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry generation mechanism, has one fully worked out\nthermal history and suggestions for other possibilities, and meets all\nphenomenological, cosmological and astrophysical constraints. Importantly, it\nincorporates a deep reason for why the dark matter mass scale is related to the\nproton mass, a key consideration in ADM models. Our starting point is the idea\nof mirror matter, which offers an explanation for dark matter by duplicating\nthe standard model with a dark sector related by a $Z_2$ parity symmetry.\nHowever, the dark sector need not manifest as a symmetric copy of the standard\nmodel in the present day. By utilising the mechanism of \"asymmetric symmetry\nbreaking\" with two Higgs doublets in each sector, we develop a model of ADM\nwhere the mirror symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to an electroweak\nscale in the dark sector that is significantly larger than that of the visible\nsector. The weak sensitivity of the ordinary and dark QCD confinement scales to\ntheir respective electroweak scales leads to the necessary connection between\nthe dark matter and proton masses. The dark matter is composed of either dark\nneutrons or a mixture of dark neutrons and metastable dark hydrogen atoms.\nLepton asymmetries are generated by the $CP$-violating decays of heavy Majorana\nneutrinos in both sectors.

The random propagation is\ncharacterized by the general class of right-sided unimodal densities.

The survey includes a range of\nvulnerabilities and potential attacks aimed at MIDs, medical and imaging\ninformation systems, and medical protocols and standards such as DICOM and HL7.\nResults: Based on our survey, we found that CT devices face the greatest risk\nof cyber-attack, due to their pivotal role in acute care imaging.

To achieve higher performance in\nthis new paradigm one has to consider how to combine the efficiency of resource\nusage at all three layers of architecture: end devices, edge devices, and the\ncloud. While cloud capacity is elastically extendable, end devices and edge\ndevices are to various degrees resource-constrained. Hence, an efficient\nresource management is essential to make edge computing a reality. In this\nwork, we first present terminology and architectures to characterize current\nworks within the field of edge computing. Then, we review a wide range of\nrecent articles and categorize relevant aspects in terms of 4 perspectives:\nresource type, resource management objective, resource location, and resource\nuse. This taxonomy and the ensuing analysis is used to identify some gaps in\nthe existing research. Among several research gaps, we found that research is\nless prevalent on data, storage, and energy as a resource, and less extensive\ntowards the estimation, discovery and sharing objectives. As for resource\ntypes, the most well-studied resources are computation and communication\nresources. Our analysis shows that resource management at the edge requires a\ndeeper understanding of how methods applied at different levels and geared\ntowards different resource types interact. Specifically, the impact of mobility\nand collaboration schemes requiring incentives are expected to be different in\nedge architectures compared to the classic cloud solutions.

We used a\nhigh-resolution optical microscopy with a 100x magnification objective,\naccurately determining the thickness of flakes as small as one micrometer in\nlateral size, which are highly desired in many applications. The results are in\nexcellent agreement with theoretical calculations and confirmed by Raman and\nAFM measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optical contrast\nspectroscopy is sensitive enough to detect the adsorption of a sub-monolayer\nairborne hydrocarbon molecules, which can reveal whether graphene is\ncon-taminated and opens the opportunity to develop miniaturized and\nultrasensitive molecular sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 11:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-18"}

To that end, we elaborate a formal framework\naiming to integrate the role of arguments and argumentation in decision theory\nand decision aid. We start from a decision situation, where an individual\nrequests decision support. In this context, we formally define, as a\ncommendable basis for decision-aid, this individual's deliberated judgment,\npopularized by Rawls. We explain how models of deliberated judgment can be\nvalidated empirically.

In practice however,\nthere is a strong limit on the model parameters that can be chosen, and thus on\nthe resulting WWR impact. This is because only non-negative shifts are allowed\nfor consistency reasons, whereas the upwards jumps of the JCIR++ need to be\ncompensated by a downward shift.

However, in the context of radiosurgery\napplications such as gamma knife, planning images are often acquired through\nMRI which impedes the use of polynomial fitting approaches for shading\ncorrection. We present a new shading correction approach that is independent of\nplanning CT images. Our algorithm is based on the assumption that true CBCT\nimages follow a uniform volumetric intensity distribution per material, and\nscatter perturbs this uniform texture by contributing cupping and shading\nartifacts in the image domain. The framework is a combination of fuzzy C-means\ncoupled with a neighborhood regularization term and Otsu's method.

In\nthis model, a supramassive neutron star supported by rapid rotation, will\ncollapse to a black hole several thousand to million years after its birth as a\nresult of spin down. The collapse violently snaps the magnetic-field lines\nanchored on the stellar surface, thus producing an electromagnetic pulse that\nwill propagate outwards and accelerate electrons producing a massive radio\nburst, i.e. a \"blitzar\". We present a systematic study of the gravitational\ncollapse of rotating and magnetised neutron stars with special attention to\nfar-field evolution at late times after the collapse. By considering a series\nof neutron stars with rotation ranging from zero to millisecond periods and\ndifferent magnetic-field strengths, we show that the blitzar emission is very\nrobust and always characterised by a series sub-millisecond pulses decaying\nexponentially in amplitude. The luminosity and energy released when the\nmagnetosphere is destroyed are well reproduced by a simple expression in terms\nof the stellar magnetic field and radius.

For this purpose we designed, implemented and tested a novel numerical\ntechnique, the \"Gravitational Ray Tracing\" (GRT) designed to compute the\nrelative impact probability (RIP) on the surface of any planet.

A recent\nexample is presented in whether the mid-rapidity charged multiplicity per\nconstituent quark participant $({dN_{\\rm ch}/d\\eta})/{N_{\\rm qp}}$ in Au$+$Au\nat RHIC was the same as the value in p$+$p collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 22:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

The analogy between the measure of a set and the probability of an\nevent has become clear for a long time. This analogy also allows further\nevolution: the measure of a set is completely analogous to the believability of\nan event.

Resulting\nmetal-dielectric (hybrid) nanostructures demonstrated many superior properties\nfrom the point of view of practical application, including moderate dissipative\nlosses, resonant optical magnetic response, strong nonlinear optical\nproperties, which made the development in this field the vanguard of the modern\nlight science. This review is devoted to the current state of theoretical and\nexperimental studies of hybrid metal-dielectric nanoantennas and nanostructures\nbased on them, capable of selective scattering light waves, amplifying and\ntransmitting optical signals in the desired direction, controlling the\npropagation of such signals, and generating optical harmonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 23:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In light of this, we present a new novel\narchitecture that is designed for high computational efficiency on both GPUs\nand CPUs, and is highly suited for deployment on Mobile Applications, Smart\nCameras, Iot devices and controllers as well as low cost drones. Our\narchitecture boasts competitive accuracies on standard Datasets even\nout-performing the original Resnet.
