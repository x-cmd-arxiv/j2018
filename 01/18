This is accomplished by identifying off-diagonal elements in\nthe inverse-covariance matrix that are non-zero. When the ratio of variables\n(p) to observations (n) approaches one, the maximum likelihood estimator of the\ncovariance matrix becomes unstable and requires shrinkage estimation. Whereas\nseveral classical (frequentist) methods have been introduced to address this\nissue, fully Bayesian methods remain relatively uncommon in practice and\nmethodological literatures. Here we introduce a Bayesian method for estimating\nsparse matrices, in which conditional relationships are determined with\nprojection predictive selection. With this method, that uses Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence and cross-validation for neighborhood selection, we reconstruct the\ninverse-covariance matrix in both low and high-dimensional settings. Through\nsimulation and applied examples, we characterized performance compared to\nseveral Bayesian methods and the graphical lasso, in addition to TIGER that\nsimilarly estimates the inverse-covariance matrix with regression. Our results\ndemonstrate that projection predictive selection not only has superior\nperformance compared to selecting the most probable model and Bayesian model\naveraging, particularly for high-dimensional data, but also compared to the the\nBayesian and classical glasso methods. Further, we show that estimating the\ninverse-covariance matrix with multiple regression is often more accurate, with\nrespect to various loss functions, and efficient than direct estimation. In\nlow-dimensional settings, we demonstrate that projection predictive selection\nalso provides competitive performance.

Some flux balance analysis (FBA) methods trade flux benefit against\nflux cost. However, if flux cost functions are linear and meant to describe\nunderlying enzyme costs, this entails that enzyme efficiencies are constant and\nignores the interplay between fluxes, metabolite concentrations and enzyme\nlevels in cells. Here I introduce realistic flux cost functions that describe\nan \"overhead cost\", namely the minimum enzyme and metabolite cost associated\nwith the fluxes in a kinetic model. These flux cost functions have general\nmathematical properties. Enzymatic flux cost functions, which represent enzyme\ncosts, scale proportionally with the flux profile and are concave on the flux\npolytope. Kinetic flux cost functions represent the sum of enzyme and\nmetabolite costs. If two flux profiles are superimposed, their different\ndemands for metabolite concentrations cause an extra compromise cost, which\nmakes flux cost functions strictly concave in almost all cases. When fluxes\nchange their direction, the enzymatic cost jumps abruptly. Here I propose two\nmethods for flux modelling: Flux Cost Minimisation, a nonlinear variant of FBA\nwith flux minimisation, and Flux Benefit Optimisation, a nonlinear variant of\nFBA with molecular crowding. The optimal flux profiles, at a given flux\nbenefit, are vertices of the flux polytope. Linear approximations of enzymatic\nflux cost can be used in FBA. In contrast to flux costs chosen ad hoc, these\nfunctions reflect the enzyme kinetics and extracellular concentrations in\nrealistic kinetic models. Based on enzymatic flux costs, we can describe the\ncell growth rate as a convex function on the flux polytope and derive\ngrowth-optimal metabolic states and statistical distributions for the fluxes in\ncell populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 16:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 07:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

This proposal is illustrated via a\nnovel quantization of a mini-superspace model in which there can be\nsuperpositions of the cosmological constant. This possibility leads to a\nfinite, bouncing unitary cosmology. Whereas the usual Wheeler--DeWitt cosmology\ngenerically displays pathological behaviour in terms of non-finite expectation\nvalues and non-unitary dynamics, the finiteness and unitarity of our model are\nformally guaranteed. For classically singular models with a massless scalar\nfield and cosmological constant, we show that well-behaved quantum observables\ncan be constructed and generic solutions to the universal Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation are singularity-free. Generic solutions of our model displays novel\nfeatures including: i) superpositions of values of the cosmological constant;\nii) universal effective physics due to non-trivial self-adjoint extensions of\nthe Hamiltonian; and iii) bound `Efimov universe' states for negative\ncosmological constant. The last feature provides a new platform for quantum\nsimulation of the early universe. A companion paper provides detailed\ninterpretation and analysis of particular cosmological solutions that display a\ncosmic bounce due to quantum gravitational effects, a well-defined FLRW limit\nfar from the bounce, and a semi-classical turnaround point in the dynamics of\nthe scalar field which resembles an effective inflationary epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 18:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 11:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

From a physical point of view it is unclear why operator\nalgebras would form a good description of nature. In this paper, we find a set\nof physically meaningful assumptions such that any physical theory satisfying\nthese assumptions must embed into the category of finite-dimensional\nC*-algebras. These assumptions were originally introduced in the setting of\neffectus theory, a categorical logical framework generalizing classical and\nquantum logic. As these assumptions have a physical interpretation, this\nmotivates the usage of operator algebras as a model for quantum theory.\n  In contrast to other reconstructions of quantum theory, we do not start with\nthe framework of generalized probabilistic theories and instead use effect\ntheories where no convex structure and no tensor product needs to be present.\nThe lack of this structure in effectus theory has led to a different notion of\npure maps. A map in an effectus is pure when it is a composition of a\ncompression and a filter. These maps satisfy particular universal properties\nand respectively correspond to `forgetting' and `measuring' the validity of an\neffect.\n  We define a pure effect theory (PET) to be an effect theory where the pure\nmaps form a dagger-category and filters and compressions are adjoint. We show\nthat any convex finite-dimensional PET must embed into the category of\nEuclidean Jordan algebras. Moreover, if the PET also has monoidal structure,\nthen we show that it must embed into either the category of real or complex\nC*-algebras, which completes our reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 18:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 12:40:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 15:39:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 10:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 10:09:36 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 11:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Tools are needed to efficiently create and\nedit those vector geospatial data. Procedural generation has been a tool of\nchoice to generate strongly organised data, yet it may be hard to control.\nBecause those data may be involved to take consequence-full real life\ndecisions, user interactions are required to check data and edit it. The\nclassical process to do so would be to build an adhoc Graphical User Interface\n(GUI) tool adapted for the model and method being used.

In this\nparadigm, GIS software simply modify geometry and attributes of database\nlayers, and those changes are used by the database to perform automated task.\n  This new paradigm has many advantages. The first one is genericity. With\nin-base interaction, any GIS software can be used to perform edition, whatever\nthe software is a Desktop sofware or a web application. The second is\nconcurrency and coherency. Because interaction is in-base, use of database\nfeatures allows seamless multi-user work, and can guarantee that the data is in\na coherent state.

To test this, we devised a novel yet simple approach to detect\nand quantify topographical features on the surfaces of exoplanets using transit\nlight curves. If a planet rotates as it transits its parent star, its changing\nsilhouette yields a time-varying transit depth, which can be observed as an\napparent and anomalous increase in the photometric scatter.

This means that the\nratio of the mass in solids (dust plus planetary) to the mass in gas rises\nsteadily over time. Dust is still stripped early on, and the initial disc mass\nrequired to produce the observed $4\\,M_{\\oplus}$ of Trappist-1 planets is high.\nFor example, assuming a Fatuzzo & Adams (2008) distribution of UV fields,\ntypical initial disc masses have to be $>30\\,$per cent the stellar (which are\nstill Toomre $Q$ stable) for the majority of similar mass M dwarfs to be viable\nhosts of the Trappist-1 planets.

The droplets are laden with surfactants that are bulk-insoluble\nand get transported only along the interface. An asymptotic approach is adopted\nfor the present analysis in order to tackle the nonlinearity present due to\ndeformation of droplets. The analysis is carried out under two different\nlimiting scenarios namely: surface diffusion-dominated-surfactant transport and\nsurface convection-dominated surfactant transport. For either of the limiting\ncases we look into the droplet dynamics for two commonly encountered bulk flows\n- uniaxial extensional and simple shear flow. Under the assumption of\nnegligible fluid inertia in either phase, it is shown that slip at the droplet\ninterface significantly affects the surfactant-induced Marangoni stress and\nhence droplet deformation and emulsion rheology. Presence of interfacial slip\nnot only brings about a decrease in the droplet deformation but also reduces\nthe effective viscosity of the emulsion. The fall in both droplet deformation\nand effective viscosity is found to be more severe for the limiting case of\nsurface convection-dominated surfactant transport. For the case of an imposed\nsimple shear flow, the normal stress differences generated due to droplet\ndeformation are affected as well due to the presence of interfacial slip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 19:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Extreme events are of particular interest, not only because of the\nscientific challenges they pose, but also because of their possible societal\nconsequences. Here we present a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the 14\nJuly 2000 Bastille Day eruption, which produced a very strong geomagnetic\nstorm. After constructing a thermodynamic MHD model of the corona and solar\nwind, we insert a magnetically stable flux rope along the polarity inversion\nline of the eruption's source region and initiate the eruption by boundary\nflows. More than 10^33 ergs of magnetic energy are released in the eruption\nwithin a few minutes, driving a flare, an EUV wave, and a coronal mass ejection\n(CME) that travels in the outer corona at about 1500 km/s, close to the\nobserved speed. We then propagate the CME to Earth, using a heliospheric MHD\ncode. Our simulation thus provides the opportunity to test how well in situ\nobservations of extreme events are matched if the eruption is initiated from a\nstable magnetic-equilibrium state. We find that the flux-rope center is very\nsimilar in character to the observed magnetic cloud, but arrives about 8.5\nhours later and about 15 degrees too far to the North, with field strengths\nthat are too weak by a factor of about 1.6. The front of the flux rope is\nhighly distorted, exhibiting localized magnetic-field concentrations as it\npasses 1 AU. We discuss these properties with regard to the development of\nspace-weather predictions based on MHD simulations of solar eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 01:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

Given unbounded fan-in, one can execute a reduction\nin constant/linear time provided that the data is available.

Absent from this current body of\nwork is a comprehensive study aimed at understanding and evaluating the static\napproaches and comparing them to dynamic approaches on a large set of projects.\n  In this work, we perform the first extensive study aimed at empirically\nevaluating four static TCP techniques comparing them with state-of-research\ndynamic TCP techniques at different test-case granularities (e.g., method and\nclass-level) in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and similarity of faults\ndetected. This study was performed on 30 real-word Java programs encompassing\n431 KLoC. In terms of effectiveness, we find that the static call-graph-based\ntechnique outperforms the other static techniques at test-class level, but the\ntopic-model-based technique performs better at test-method level. In terms of\nefficiency, the static call-graph-based technique is also the most efficient\nwhen compared to other static techniques. When examining the similarity of\nfaults detected for the four static techniques compared to the four dynamic\nones, we find that on average, the faults uncovered by these two groups of\ntechniques are quite dissimilar, with the top 10% of test cases agreeing on\nonly 25% - 30% of detected faults. This prompts further research into the\nseverity/importance of faults uncovered by these techniques, and into the\npotential for combining static and dynamic information for more effective\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 02:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

The first step is to obtain pressure waveform due to a\npoint dose absorption by solving the thermo-acoustic equation governing the\nheat absorption-pressure induction process based on the analytic integration\ntechnique. Then, clinically relevant XA signal profile at the detection point\nis obtained by generalizing point-dose-gradient induced acoustic signal to\nsurface-dose-gradient of a uniform spherical 3D dose distribution based on the\nreciprocity principle for pressure waves in fluid media.

Beyond this radius, ML steeply increases toward\nthe observed edges at $R\\sim 5h$, attaining values as high as ML$\\sim 20$ in w1\nand $\\sim 10^2\\ [M_\\odot L_\\odot^{-1}]$ in r-band, indicative of dominant dark\nmatter. The general properties of the ML distributions will be useful to\nconstrain cosmological formation models of spiral galaxies.

For\neach of these properties we provide a corresponding syntactic fragment, in the\nsense that a $\\mu$-formula $\\xi$ has the given property iff it is equivalent to\na formula $\\xi'$ in the corresponding fragment. Since this formula $\\xi'$ will\nalways be effectively obtainable from $\\xi$, as a corollary, for each of the\nproperties under discussion, we prove that it is decidable in elementary time\nwhether a given $\\mu$-calculus formula has the property or not.\n  The properties that we study all concern the way in which the meaning of a\nformula $\\xi$ in a model depends on the meaning of a single, fixed proposition\nletter $p$. For example, consider a formula $\\xi$ which is monotone in $p$;\nsuch a formula a formula $\\xi$ is called continuous (respectively, fully\nadditive), if in addition it satisfies the property that, if $\\xi$ is true at a\nstate $s$ then there is a finite set (respectively, a singleton set) $U$ such\nthat $\\xi$ remains true at $s$ if we restrict the interpretation of $p$ to the\nset $U$. Each of the properties that we consider is, in a similar way,\nassociated with one of the following special kinds of subset of a tree model:\nsingletons, finite sets, finitely branching subtrees, noetherian subtrees\n(i.e., without infinite paths), and branches.\n  Our proofs for these characterization results will be automata-theoretic in\nnature; we will see that the effectively defined maps on formulas are in fact\ninduced by rather simple transformations on modal automata.

First, we propose a new methodology for optimizing\nthe deconvolutional neural networks (DCNNs) used for increasing feature maps.\nSecondly, we propose a novel method to optimize CNN dataflow so that the SR\nalgorithm can be driven at low power in display applications. Finally, we\nquantize and compress a DCNN-based SR algorithm into an optimal model for\nefficient inference using on-chip memory. We present an energy-efficient\narchitecture for SR and validate our architecture on a mobile panel with\nquad-high-definition (QHD) resolution. Our experimental results show that, with\nthe same hardware resources, the proposed DCNN accelerator achieves a\nthroughput up to 108 times greater than that of a conventional DCNN\naccelerator. In addition, our SR system achieves an energy efficiency of 144.9\nGOPS/W, 293.0 GOPS/W, and 500.2 GOPS/W at SR scale factors of 2, 3, and 4,\nrespectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our system can restore HR images\nto a high quality while greatly reducing the data bit-width and the number of\nparameters compared to conventional SR algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 13:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 00:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 15:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 14:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

The classical $M^X/G/1$\nqueue with semi-Markov service times is the most prominent example in this\nclass and serves as a vehicle to display our results. The sequence of service\ntimes is governed by a modulating process $J(t)$. The state of $J(\\cdot)$ at a\nservice initiation time determines the joint distribution of the subsequent\nservice duration and the state of $J(\\cdot)$ at the next service initiation.\n  Several earlier works have imposed technical conditions, on the zeros of a\nmatrix determinant arising in the analysis, that are required in the\ncomputation of the stationary queue length probabilities. The imposed\nconditions in several of these articles are difficult or impossible to verify.\nWithout such assumptions, we determine both the transient and the steady-state\njoint distribution of the number of customers immediately after a departure and\nthe state of the process $J(t)$ at the start of the next service.\n  We numerically investigate how the mean queue length is affected by\nvariability in the number of customers that arrive during a single service\ntime. Our main observations here are that increasing variability may {\\em\nreduce} the mean queue length, and that the Markovian dependence of service\ntimes can lead to large queue lengths, even if the system is not in heavy\ntraffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 13:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

In this work, we present a new method to\ntransform the discretized governing equations so that the transformed problem\nhas significantly reduced nonlinearity and, therefore, Newton solvers exhibit\nimproved convergence properties. We study exponential-type nonlinearity in soft\ntissues and geometric nonlinearity in compression, and propose novel\nformulations for the two problems. We test the new formulations in several\nnumerical examples and show significant reduction in iterations required for\nconvergence, especially at large load steps. Notably, the proposed formulation\nis capable of yielding convergent solution even when 10 to 100 times larger\nload steps are applied. The proposed framework is generic and can be applied to\nother types of nonlinearities as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 13:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2018 14:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

Conventional digital predistortion (DPD) schemes use\nhigh-order polynomials to accurately approximate and compensate for the\nnonlinearity of the PA. This is not practical for scaling to tens or hundreds\nof PAs in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. There is more\nthan one candidate precoding matrix in a massive MIMO system because of the\nexcess degrees-of-freedom (DoFs), and each precoding matrix requires a\ndifferent DPD polynomial order to compensate for the PA nonlinearity. This\npaper proposes a low-order DPD method achieved by exploiting massive DoFs of\nnext-generation front ends. We propose a novel indirect learning structure\nwhich adapts the channel and PA distortion iteratively by cascading adaptive\nzero forcing precoding and DPD.

In detail, all of these results depend on the distance to the host\ngalaxy of the merger event, NGC4993. In this paper we measure the surface\nbrightness fluctuation (SBF) distance to NGC4993 in the F110W and F160W\npassbands of the Wide Field Camera 3 Infrared Channel on the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST). For the preferred F110W passband we derive a distance modulus\nof $m{-}M=33.05\\pm0.08\\pm0.10$ mag, or a linear distance $d=40.7\\pm1.4\\pm1.9$\nMpc (random and systematic errors, respectively); a virtually identical result\nis obtained from the F160W data. This is the most precise distance to NGC4993\navailable to date. Combining our distance measurement with the corrected\nrecession velocity of NGC4993 implies a Hubble constant $H_0=71.9\\pm\n7.1~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$.

How gas on galactic scales is transported to the nuclear region to\nform and maintain such a stable structure is, however, unclear.

However, this approach is incapable\nof restoring distinctive image details which may be statistical outliers but\nhave high semantic importance (e.g., tiny lesions in medical images). To\novercome this weakness, we propose to incorporate an $\\ell_\\infty$ fidelity\ncriterion in the design of neural network so that no small, distinctive\nstructures of the original image can be dropped or distorted. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods in $\\ell_\\infty$ error metric and perceptual quality, while being\ncompetitive in $\\ell_2$ error metric as well. It can restore subtle image\ndetails that are otherwise destroyed or missed by other algorithms.

Compared to the size of databases for face recognition, far less\nlabeled data is available for training smile detection systems. To leverage the\nlarge amount of labeled data from face recognition datasets and to alleviate\noverfitting on smile detection, an efficient transfer learning-based smile\ndetection approach is proposed in this paper. Unlike previous works which use\neither hand-engineered features or train deep convolutional networks from\nscratch, a well-trained deep face recognition model is explored and fine-tuned\nfor smile detection in the wild.

Accurate and fast\ndetection of this fluids migration is not only important but also challenging,\ndue to the large subsurface uncertainty and complex governing physics.\nTraditional leakage detection and monitoring techniques rely on geophysical\nobservations including seismic. However, the resulting accuracy of these\nmethods is limited because of indirect information they provide requiring\nexpert interpretation, therefore yielding in-accurate estimates of leakage\nrates and locations. In this work, we develop a novel machine-learning\ndetection package, named \"Seismic-Net\", which is based on the deep densely\nconnected neural network. To validate the performance of our proposed leakage\ndetection method, we employ our method to a natural analog site at Chimay\\'o,\nNew Mexico. The seismic events in the data sets are generated because of the\neruptions of geysers, which is due to the leakage of $\\mathrm{CO}_\\mathrm{2}$.\nIn particular, we demonstrate the efficacy of our Seismic-Net by formulating\nour detection problem as an event detection problem with time series data. A\nfixed-length window is slid throughout the time series data and we build a deep\ndensely connected network to classify each window to determine if a geyser\nevent is included. Through our numerical tests, we show that our model achieves\nprecision/recall as high as 0.889/0.923. Therefore, our Seismic-Net has a great\npotential for detection of $\\mathrm{CO}_\\mathrm{2}$ leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 17:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

The accurate segmentation of subcortical brain structures is crucial to\nthe study of gliomas in that it helps the monitoring of the progression of\ngliomas and aids the evaluation of treatment outcomes. However, the large\namount of required human labor makes it difficult to obtain the manually\nsegmented Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, limiting the use of precise\nquantitative measurements in the clinical practice. In this work, we try to\naddress this problem by developing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network~(3D CNN)\nbased model to automatically segment gliomas. The major difficulty of our\nsegmentation model comes with the fact that the location, structure, and shape\nof gliomas vary significantly among different patients. In order to accurately\nclassify each voxel, our model captures multi-scale contextual information by\nextracting features from two scales of receptive fields. To fully exploit the\ntumor structure, we propose a novel architecture that hierarchically segments\ndifferent lesion regions of the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor~(NCR/NET),\nperitumoral edema~(ED) and GD-enhancing tumor~(ET). Additionally, we utilize\ndensely connected convolutional blocks to further boost the performance. We\ntrain our model with a patch-wise training schema to mitigate the class\nimbalance problem. The proposed method is validated on the BraTS 2017 dataset\nand it achieves Dice scores of 0.72, 0.83 and 0.81 for the complete tumor,\ntumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.

Streets reconstruction has been seldom\nresearched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a\nunique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing\nthe recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by\nconsidering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for\ncity models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse\nwhich data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street\nreconstruction, street network reconstruction, urban features\nreconstruction/modelling, vegetation , and urban objects\nreconstruction/modelling.\n  Although reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role\nthe model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse\nprocedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to\ncome from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of\nthe available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and\nto their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations. Procedural\nmodelling has the power to express these relations, and could be applied to the\nreconstruction of urban features via the Inverse Procedural Modelling paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 02:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}
