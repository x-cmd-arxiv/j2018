These methods require data with good signal-to-noise ratio and\nreliable continuum normalisation. This is particularly challenging for the\nspectra we have obtained with the CORALIE \\'{e}chelle spectrograph for FGK\nstars with transiting M-dwarf companions. The spectra tend to have low\nsignal-to-noise ratios, which makes it difficult to analyse them using existing\nmethods. Our aim is to create a reliable automated spectral analysis routine to\ndetermine $T_{\\rm eff}$, [Fe/H], $V \\sin i$ from the CORALIE spectra of FGK\nstars. We use wavelet decomposition to distinguish between noise, continuum\ntrends, and stellar spectral features in the CORALIE spectra. A subset of\nwavelet coefficients from the target spectrum are compared to those from a grid\nof models in a Bayesian framework to determine the posterior probability\ndistributions of the atmospheric parameters. By testing our method using\nsynthetic spectra we found that our method converges on the best fitting\natmospheric parameters. We test the wavelet method on 20 FGK exoplanet host\nstars for which higher quality data have been independently analysed using\nequivalent width measurements. We find that we can determine $T_{\\rm eff}$ to a\nprecision of $85$K, [Fe/H] to a precision of 0.06 dex and $V \\sin i$ to a\nprecision of 1.35 kms$^{-1}$ for stars with $V \\sin i$ $\\geq$ 5 kms$^{-1}$. We\nfind an offset in metallicity $\\approx -$0.18 dex relative to the equivelent\nwidth fitting method. We can determine $\\log g$ to a precision of $0.13$ dex\nbut measurements are only reliable to confirm dwarf-like surface gravity. The\nwavelet method can be used to determine $T_{\\rm eff}$, [Fe/H] and $V \\sin i$\nfor FGK stars from \\'{e}chelle spectra. We find that our method is self\nconsistent, and robust for spectra with SNR$\\gtrapprox 40$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 16:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

For a sample of G and K type hosts, most of these planets\nwill be between 25 and 50 milli-arcsec (mas) from their host star and 1 billion\nto 10 billion times fainter. To separate the planet's image from that of its\nhost star at the wavelength (763nm) of the oxygen biosignature we need a\ntelescope with an aperture of 16 metres. Furthermore, the intensity of the\nlight from the host star at the position in the image of the exoplanet must be\nsuppressed otherwise the exoplanet will be lost in the glare.\n  This presents huge technical challenges. The Earth's atmosphere is turbulent\nwhich makes it impossible to achieve the required contrast from the ground at\n763nm. The telescope therefore needs to be in space and to fit the telescope in\nthe rocket fairing it must be a factor of 4 or more times smaller when folded\nthan when operational. To obtain spectroscopy of the planet's biosignature at\n763nm we need to use an integral field spectrometer (IFS) with a field of view\n(FOV) of 1000 x 1000 milli-arcsec (mas) and a spectral resolution of 100. This\nis a device that simultaneously takes many pictures of the exoplanet each at a\nslightly different wavelength which are then recorded as a data cube with two\nspatial dimensions and one wavelength dimension. In every data cube wavelength\nslice, the background light from the host star at the location of the planet\nimage must be minimised. This is achieved via a coronagraph which blocks the\nlight from the host star and active/adaptive optics techniques which\ncontinuously maintain very high accuracy optical alignment to make the images\nas sharp as possible. These are the technical challenges to be addressed in a\ndesign study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 16:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

Possible\nexplanations are emission from a cocoon or cocoon break out, off-axis view of a\nstructured or uniform jet, and on-axis ultra-relativistic jet with reduced\ndensity and Lorentz factor. Here we use a phenomenological model of shock\nevolution and synchrotron/self-Compton emission to simulate the prompt emission\nof GRB 170817A and to test above proposals. We find that synchrotron emission\nfrom a mildly relativistic cocoon with a Lorentz factor of 2-3, as considered\nin the literature, generates a too soft, too long, and too bright prompt\nemission. Off-axis view of an structured jet with a Lorentz factor of about 10\ncan reproduce observations, but needs a very efficient transfer of kinetic\nenergy to electrons in internal shocks, which is disfavored by particle in cell\nsimulations. We also comment on cocoon breakout as a mechanism for generation\nof the prompt gamma-ray. A relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of about 100\nand a density lower than typical short GRBs seems to be the most plausible\nmodel and we conclude that GRB 170817A was intrinsically faint.

In the\nbacterium Myxococcus xanthus, the proteins PomX and PomY form a cluster on the\nchromosome that performs a biased random walk to midcell and positively\nregulates cell division there. PomZ, an ATPase, is necessary for tethering of\nthe cluster to the nucleoid and regulates its movement towards midcell. It has\nremained unclear how the cluster dynamics change when the biochemical\nparameters, such as the attachment rates of PomZ to the nucleoid and the\ncluster, the ATP hydrolysis rate of PomZ or the mobility of PomZ dimers\ninteracting with the nucleoid and cluster, are varied. To answer these\nquestions, we investigate a one-dimensional model that includes the nucleoid,\nthe Pom cluster and the PomZ protein. We find that a mechanism based on the\ndiffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the cluster can explain the latter's\nmidnucleoid localization for a broad parameter range. Furthermore, there is an\nATP hydrolysis rate that minimizes the time the cluster needs to reach\nmidnucleoid. If the dynamics of PomZ dimers on the nucleoid is slow relative to\nthe cluster's velocity, we observe oscillatory cluster movements around\nmidnucleoid. To understand midnucleoid localization, we developed a\nsemi-analytical approach that dissects the net movement of the cluster into its\ncomponents: the difference in PomZ fluxes into the cluster from either side,\nthe force exerted by a single PomZ dimer on the cluster and the effective\nfriction coefficient of the cluster. Importantly, we predict that the Pom\ncluster oscillates around midnucleoid if the diffusivity of PomZ on the\nnucleoid is reduced. A similar approach to that applied here may also prove\nuseful for cargo localization in ParABS systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 17:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Results are shown for lattice-gases where the local free energy can be\ncomputed exactly, and for a system of Lennard-Jones particles under the effect\nof a static confining field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

Sky models have been\ncreated for two distinct populations of extragalactic gamma-ray emitters:\nactive galactic nuclei from the second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT sources (2FHL)\nand starburst galaxies from a sample that was examined with Fermi-LAT.\nFlux-limited samples, which include all types of galaxies from the Swift-BAT\nand 2MASS surveys, have been investigated for comparison. The sky model of\ncosmic-ray density constructed using each catalog has two free parameters, the\nfraction of events correlating with astrophysical objects and an angular scale\ncharacterizing the clustering of cosmic rays around extragalactic sources. A\nmaximum-likelihood ratio test is used to evaluate the best values of these\nparameters and to quantify the strength of each model by contrast with\nisotropy. It is found that the starburst model fits the data better than the\nhypothesis of isotropy with a statistical significance of 4.0 sigma, the\nhighest value of the test statistic being for energies above 39 EeV. The three\nalternative models are favored against isotropy with 2.7-3.2 sigma\nsignificance. The origin of the indicated deviation from isotropy is examined\nand prospects for more sensitive future studies are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:23:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 17:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

In the literature, topics are often treated as\none of (a) hashtags (independent from other hashtags), (b) a burst of keywords\nin a short time span or (c) a latent concept space captured by advanced text\nanalysis methodologies, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The first\ntwo approaches are not capable of recognizing topics where different users use\ndifferent hashtags to express the same concept (semantically related), while\nthe third approach misses out the user's explicit intent expressed via\nhashtags. In our work, we use a word embedding based approach to cluster\ndifferent hashtags together, and the temporal concurrency of the hashtag\nusages, thus forming topics (a semantically and temporally related group of\nhashtags).We present a novel analysis of topic lifecycles with respect to\ncommunities. We characterize the participation of social communities in the\ntopic clusters, and analyze the lifecycle of topic clusters with respect to\nsuch participation. We derive first-of-its-kind novel insights with respect to\nthe complex evolution of topics over communities and time: temporal morphing of\ntopics over hashtags within communities, how the hashtags die in some\ncommunities but morph into some other hashtags in some other communities (that,\nit is a community-level phenomenon), and how specific communities adopt to\nspecific hashtags. Our work is fundamental in the space of topic lifecycle\nmodeling and understanding in communities: it redefines our understanding of\ntopic lifecycles and shows that the social boundaries of topic lifecycles are\ndeeply ingrained with community behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-19"}

We use finite-size scaling to estimate $T_c$ at the corresponding\nfilling factor.

We examine two models of\nlosses. In the first model a fixed number of particles is lost. We prove that\nin this scenario the output statistics can be well approximated by an efficient\nclassical simulation, provided that the number of photons that is left grows\nslower than $\\sqrt{n}$. In the second loss model, every time a photon passes\nthrough a beamsplitter in the network, it has some probability of being lost.\nFor this model the relevant parameter is $s$, the smallest number of\nbeamsplitters that any photon traverses as it propagates through the network.\nWe prove that it is possible to approximately simulate the output statistics\nalready if $s$ grows logarithmically with $m$, regardless of the geometry of\nthe network.

However, there\nare many interesting candidate systems displaying TTVs on such long time scales\nthat the existing Kepler observations are of insufficient length to confirm and\ncharacterize them by means of this technique. To continue with Kepler's unique\nwork we have organized the \"Kepler Object of Interest Network\" (KOINet).

Identifying\nthese communities is of great importance when analyzing structural properties\nof networks. Hence, recent years have witnessed intense research in of solving\nthe challenging problem of detecting such evolving communities. The mainstream\napproach towards community detection involves optimization of a global\npartition quality metric (e.g. modularity) over the network. Another technique,\nSpectral Clustering, involves mapping of original data points in a lower\ndimensional space, where the clustering properties of a graph are much more\nevident, and then applying standard clustering techniques for identifying\ncommunities. However, the traditional spectral clustering techniques cannot\nnaturally learn the number of communities in networks. These techniques are\nbased on external community connectivity properties, and often fail to identify\nsmaller community structures in dense networks. In this article, we propose an\nalgorithm, namely, the Cascaded Stackelberg Community Detection Algorithm\n(CASCODE) inspired by the Stackelberg Duopoly Game. This algorithm uses the\nnotion of a leader-follower relationship between the nodes to influence the\nactions of either. The intuition of the algorithm is based on the natural\nexpected internal structure in evolving communities in networks. Thus, the\nalgorithm is able to naturally learn the number of communities in a network in\ncontrast with other techniques such as Spectral Clustering, which require the\nexpected number of communities as an input. Because this Stackelberg\nModel-based Community Detection algorithm detects communities through their\ninternal structure, we are able to obtain a finer community structure\nresolution in dense networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

The energy source for the higher temperature X-ray\nemitting plasma pervading the Local Bubble is uncertain. Winds from massive\nstars and nearby supernovae, perhaps from the Sco-Cen Association, may have\ncontributed radioisotopes found in the geologic record and galactic cosmic ray\npopulation. Nested supernova shells in the Orion and Sco-Cen regions suggest\nspatially distinct sites of episodic star formation.

A nearby\nsupernova would modify this pressure equilibrium and thereby severely disrupt\nthe heliosphere as well as the local interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 20:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

It fails to explain the underdoped cuprate superconductivity:\nEG is finite at Tc and thus distinct from OP. Since these superconductors\nbelong to a large class of small $\\xi$ materials, this failure has the\npotential for widespread impact.\n  Here we have extended BCS theory in a natural way to short $\\xi$\nsuperconductors, based on a BCS--BEC crossover scenario, and arrived at a\nsimple physical picture in which incoherent, finite momentum pairs become\nprogressively more important as the pairing interaction becomes stronger,\nleading to the distinction between EG and OP.

Then, the final HDR\nimage can be formed by merging these inference results. It is relatively easy\nfor the proposed method to find the mapping between the LDR and an HDR with a\ndifferent bit depth because of the chaining structure inferring the\nrelationship between the LDR images with brighter (or darker) exposures from a\ngiven LDR image. The method not only extends the range, but also has the\nadvantage of restoring the light information of the actual physical world.

Challenges arise when companies run\nadvertising campaigns in multiple stores which are spatially correlated, and\nwhen the sales data have a low signal-to-noise ratio which makes the\nadvertising effects hard to detect. This paper proposes a solution to address\nboth of these challenges. A novel Bayesian method is proposed to detect weaker\nimpacts and a multivariate structural time series model is used to capture the\nspatial correlation between stores through placing a $\\mathcal{G}$-Wishart\nprior on the precision matrix. The new method is to compare two posterior\ndistributions of a latent variable---one obtained by using the observed data\nfrom the test stores and the other one obtained by using the data from their\ncounterfactual potential outcomes. The counterfactual potential outcomes are\nestimated from the data of synthetic controls, each of which is a linear\ncombination of sales figures at many control stores over the causal period.\nControl stores are selected using a revised Expectation-Maximization variable\nselection (EMVS) method. A two-stage algorithm is proposed to estimate the\nparameters of the model. To prevent the prediction intervals from being\nexplosive, a stationarity constraint is imposed on the local linear trend of\nthe model through a recently proposed prior. The benefit of using this prior is\ndiscussed in this paper. A detailed simulation study shows the effectiveness of\nusing our proposed method to detect weaker causal impact.

To determine the molecular class of the tumour, pathologists will have\nto manually mark the nuclei activity biomarkers through a microscope and use a\nsemi-quantitative assessment method to assign a histochemical score (H-Score)\nto each TMA core. Manually marking positively stained nuclei is a time\nconsuming, imprecise and subjective process which will lead to inter-observer\nand intra-observer discrepancies.

Our system\nimitates the pathologists' decision process and uses one fully convolutional\nnetwork (FCN) to extract all nuclei region (tumour and non-tumour), a second\nFCN to extract tumour nuclei region, and a multi-column convolutional neural\nnetwork which takes the outputs of the first two FCNs and the stain intensity\ndescription image as input and acts as the high-level decision making mechanism\nto directly output the H-Score of the input TMA image.

Yet, unlike a latent class MNL\nmodel, the proposed discrete choice model does not require the analyst to fix\nthe number of mixture components prior to estimation, as the complexity of the\ndiscrete mixing distribution is inferred from the evidence. For posterior\ninference in the proposed Dirichlet process mixture model of discrete choice,\nwe derive an expectation maximisation algorithm.

The convection of surfactants in\nconjunction with the the combined effect electrohydrodynamic flow and\nsedimentation leads to a locally varying surface tension, which subsequently\nalters the drop dynamics via the interplay of Marangoni, Maxwell and\nhydrodynamic stresses. Assuming small capillary number and small electric\nReynolds number, we employ a regular perturbation technique to solve the\ncoupled system of governing equations. It is shown that when a leaky dielectric\ndrop is sedimenting in another leaky dielectric fluid, Marangoni stress can\noppose the electrohydrodynamic motion severely, thereby causing corresponding\nchanges in internal flow pattern. Such effects further result in retardation of\ndrop settling velocity, which would have otherwise increased due to the\ninfluence of charge convection. For highly mobile surfactants (high Peclet\nnumber limit), the drop surface becomes immobilized and the charge convection\neffect gets completely eliminated. For non-spherical drop shapes, the effect of\nMarangoni stress is overcome by the 'tip stretching' effect on the flow field.\nAs a result, the drop deformation gets intensified with increment in\nsensitivity of surface tension to the local surfactant concentration.\nConsequently, for oblate type of deformation the elevated drag force causes\nfurther reduction in velocity. Owing to similar reasons, prolate drops\nexperience lesser drag and settles faster than the surfactant-free case. In\naddition to this, with increased sensitivity of interfacial tension on the\nsurfactant concentration, the asymmetric deformation about the equator gets\nsuppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 06:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

We have been looking for a simple method to\nalign the phases of jointly transmitting nodes (e.g. sensor or IoT nodes). The\nalgorithmic solution to this problem was to implement a distributed random\noptimisation method on the participating nodes in which the transmitters and\nthe receiver follow an iterative question-and-answer scheme. We have been able\nto derive sharp asymptotic bounds on the expected optimisation time of an\nevolutionary random optimiser and presented an asymptotically optimal approach.\n  One thing that we have learned from the work on these physical layer\nalgorithms was that the signals we work on are fragile and perceptive to\nphysical environmental changes.

Similarly to what\nhas been observed near hard walls, we find that such colloids can be set into\nmotion even if their whole surface is homogeneously active. This is due to the\nanisotropy along the direction normal to the interface owing to the\npartitioning by diffusion, among the coexisting fluid phases, of the product of\nthe chemical reaction taking place at the colloid surface. Different from\nresults corresponding to hard walls, in the case of a fluid interface the\ndirection of motion, i.e., towards the interface or away from it, can be\ncontrolled by tuning the physical properties of one of the two fluid phases.\nThis effect is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, both by resorting to\na far-field approximation and via an exact, analytical calculation which\nprovides the means for a critical assessment of the approximate analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 09:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

Several parametric deformations of an initial hull\nshape are considered to assess the influence of the shape parameters considered\non the hull total drag. The hull resistance is typically computed by means of\nnumerical simulations of the hydrodynamic flow past the ship. Given the high\nnumber of parameters involved - which might result in a high number of time\nconsuming hydrodynamic simulations - assessing whether the parameters space can\nbe reduced would lead to considerable computational cost reduction. Thus, the\nmain idea of this work is to employ the active subspaces to identify possible\nlower dimensional structures in the parameter space, or to verify the parameter\ndistribution in the position of the control points. To this end, a fully\nautomated procedure has been implemented to produce several small shape\nperturbations of an original hull CAD geometry which are then used to carry out\nhigh-fidelity flow simulations and collect data for the active subspaces\nanalysis. To achieve full automation of the open source pipeline described,\nboth the free form deformation methodology employed for the hull perturbations\nand the solver based on unsteady potential flow theory, with fully nonlinear\nfree surface treatment, are directly interfaced with CAD data structures and\noperate using IGES vendor-neutral file formats as input files. The\ncomputational cost of the fluid dynamic simulations is further reduced through\nthe application of dynamic mode decomposition to reconstruct the steady state\ntotal drag value given only few initial snapshots of the simulation. The active\nsubspaces analysis is here applied to the geometry of the DTMB-5415 naval\ncombatant hull, which is a common benchmark in ship hydrodynamics simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 11:21:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 15:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Although it conditionally\nsubtracts the energy quanta from the oscillator, average energy grows, and\nsecond-order correlation function approaches unity as by coherent external\ndriving.

We employ time-bin entanglement, which is suitable for a fibre\ntransmission, and implement scalable measurements for the high-dimensional\nentanglement using cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We observe that a\npair of time-bin entangled photons has more than 1 bit of secure information\ncapacity over 100 km. Our work constitutes an important step towards secure and\ndense quantum communications in a large Hilbert space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 12:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

For the five-field theory a\ngeneral dispersion relation has been derived with the help of relevant\nlinearized perturbation equations, showing that the shear viscosity parameter\nalters the propagating modes for large and small wavelengths. The behavior of\ndensity and temperature contrasts are analyzed for the hard-sphere model in\ndetail. In the small wavelengths regime, increasing the amount of shear\nviscosity into the system forces the harmonic perturbations to damp faster,\nhowever, in the opposite limit larger values of shear viscosity lead to smaller\nvalues of density and temperature contrasts. For the hyperbolic case, the\ndispersion relation becomes a polynomial in the frequency with two orders\nhigher in relation to the five-field theory, indicating that the effects\nassociated with the shear viscosity and heat flux are non-trivial. The profile\nof Jeans mass in terms of the temperature and number density is explored by\ncontrasting with several data of molecular clouds. Regarding the dynamical\nevolution of the density, temperature, stress and heat flux contrasts for a\nuniverse dominated by pressureless matter, we obtain also damped harmonic waves\nfor small wavelengths.

In this paper, we propose RAQ -- Relationship-Aware Graph\nQuerying, to mitigate this gap. Given a query graph, RAQ identifies the $k$\nbest matching subgraphs of the target graph that encode similar relationships\nas in the query graph. To assess the utility of RAQ as a graph querying\nparadigm for knowledge discovery and exploration tasks, we perform a user\nsurvey on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), where an overwhelming 86% of the\n170 surveyed users preferred the relationship-aware match over traditional\ngraph querying.

First we\nformally define the concept of differential privacy for structured databases\nsuch as graphs, and give an alternative definition based on a new neighborhood\nnotion between graphs. This definition is adapted to particular frameworks that\ncan be met in various application fields such as genomics, world wide web,\npopulation survey, etc. Second, we introduce a new algorithm to tackle the\nissue of privately releasing an approximated minimum spanning tree topology for\na simple-undirected-weighted graph. It provides a simple way of producing the\ntopology of a private almost minimum spanning tree which outperforms, in most\ncases, the state of the art \"Laplace mechanism\" in terms of\nweight-approximation error.\n  Finally, we propose a theoretically motivated method combining a sanitizing\nmechanism (such as Laplace or our new algorithm) with a Minimum Spanning Tree\n(MST)-based clustering algorithm. It provides an accurate method for nodes\nclustering in a graph while keeping the sensitive information contained in the\nedges weights of the private graph. We provide some theoretical results on the\nrobustness of an almost minimum spanning tree construction for Laplace\nsanitizing mechanisms. These results exhibit which conditions the graph weights\nshould respect in order to consider that the nodes form well separated clusters\nboth for Laplace and our algorithm as sanitizing mechanism. The method has been\nexperimentally evaluated on simulated data, and preliminary results show the\ngood behavior of the algorithm while identifying well separated clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 14:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

Unfortunately, approaches like K-SVD - that learn dictionaries\nfor sparse coding via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - are hard to scale to\nhigh-volume and high-dimensional visual data, and fragile in the presence of\noutliers. Conversely, robust component analysis methods such as the Robust\nPrincipal Component Analysis (RPCA) are able to recover low-complexity (e.g.,\nlow-rank) representations from data corrupted with noise of unknown magnitude\nand support, but do not provide a dictionary that respects the structure of the\ndata (e.g., images), and also involve expensive computations.

Recently proposed methods for\npredicting cross-lingual semantic similarity of short texts, however, make use\nof tools and resources (e.g., machine translation systems, syntactic parsers or\nnamed entity recognition) that for many languages (or language pairs) do not\nexist. In contrast, we propose an unsupervised and a very resource-light\napproach for measuring semantic similarity between texts in different\nlanguages. To operate in the bilingual (or multilingual) space, we project\ncontinuous word vectors (i.e., word embeddings) from one language to the vector\nspace of the other language via the linear translation model. We then align\nwords according to the similarity of their vectors in the bilingual embedding\nspace and investigate different unsupervised measures of semantic similarity\nexploiting bilingual embeddings and word alignments. Requiring only a\nlimited-size set of word translation pairs between the languages, the proposed\napproach is applicable to virtually any pair of languages for which there\nexists a sufficiently large corpus, required to learn monolingual word\nembeddings. Experimental results on three different datasets for measuring\nsemantic textual similarity show that our simple resource-light approach\nreaches performance close to that of supervised and resource intensive methods,\ndisplaying stability across different language pairs.

These abundances are\nsubstantially lower than the single previous measurement, S/H=35+/-7 percent\nsolar (Lu et al. 1998), but are in agreement with those reported in the SMC\nfilament of the trailing Stream, supporting a common origin in the SMC (not the\nLMC) for the majority of the LA and the trailing Stream. This provides\nimportant constraints for models of the formation of the Magellanic System.\nFinally, the HVCs in two of the three nearby sightlines show H I columns,\nkinematics, and oxygen abundances consistent with LA membership. This suggests\nthat the LA is larger than traditionally thought, extending at least 20 degrees\nfurther to the Galactic northwest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 15:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

The Java software does\nnot require outstanding skills, and comes with detailed user-guide\ndocumentation. The application is based on the so-called Classical Density\nFunctional Theory Solver (CSDFTS), which was successfully applied to a variety\nof rod-like biopolymers, rigid-like globular proteins, nanoparticles, and\nnano-rods. CSDFTS implements several electrolyte and macroion models, uses\ndifferent level of approximation and takes advantage of high performance\nFortran90 routines and optimized libraries. These features enable the software\nto run on single processor computers at low-to-moderate computational cost\ndepending on the computer performance, the grid resolution, and the\ncharacterization of the macroion and the electrolyte solution, among other\nfactors. As a unique feature, the software comes with a graphical user\ninterface (GUI) that allows users to take advantage of the visually guided\nsetup of the required input data to properly characterize the system and\nconfigure the solver. Several examples on nanomaterials and biomolecules are\nprovided to illustrate the use of the GUI and the solver performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 01:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

L-DACS1 employs modern and\nefficient orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation\ntechnique to achieve more efficient and higher data rate in comparison to the\nexisting aeronautical communication systems. However, the performance of OFDM\nsystems is very sensitive to synchronization errors such as symbol timing\noffset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO). STO and CFO estimations are\nextremely important for maintaining orthogonality among the subcarriers for the\nretrieval of information. This paper proposes a novel efficient hardware\nsynchronizer for L-DACS1 systems that offers robust performance at low power\nand low hardware resource usage. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed\nsynchronization algorithm provides accurate STO estimation as well as\nfractional CFO estimation. Implementation of the proposed synchronizer on a\nwidely used field-programmable gate array (FPGA) (Xilinx xc7z020clg484-1)\nresults in a very low hardware usage which consumed 6.5%, 3.7%, and 6.4% of the\ntotal number of lookup tables, flip-flops, and digital signal processing\nblocks, respectively.

When further reducing X-ray dose to an ultra-low level by lowering\nthe tube current, photon starvation happens and electronic noise starts to\ndominate, which introduces negative or zero values into the raw measurements.\nThese non-positive values pose challenges to post-log SIR methods that require\ntaking the logarithm of the raw data, and causes artifacts in the reconstructed\nimages if simple correction methods are used to process these non-positive raw\nmeasurements. The raw data at ultra-low dose deviates significantly from\nPoisson or shifted Poisson statistics for pre-log data and from Gaussian\nstatistics for post-log data. This paper proposes a novel SIR method called MPG\n(mixed Poisson-Gaussian). MPG models the raw noisy measurements using a mixed\nPoisson-Gaussian distribution that accounts for both the quantum noise and\nelectronic noise. MPG is able to directly use the negative and zero values in\nraw data without any pre-processing. MPG cost function contains a reweighted\nleast square data-fit term, an edge preserving regularization term and a\nnon-negativity constraint term. We use Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (ADMM) to separate the MPG optimization problem into several\nsub-problems that are easier to solve. Our results on 3D simulated cone-beam\ndata set and synthetic helical data set generated from clinical data indicate\nthat the proposed MPG method reduces noise and decreases bias in the\nreconstructed images, comparing with the conventional filtered back projection\n(FBP), penalized weighted least-square (PWLS) and shift Poisson (SP) method for\nultra-low dose CT (ULDCT) imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 05:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}
