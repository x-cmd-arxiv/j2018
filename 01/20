The\ncombined effect of stellar winds from hot stars and supernova explosions\ncreates a high-temperature cavity in the nuclear region of these objects. The\nvery hot gas expands adiabatically and escapes from the galaxy creating a\nsuperwind which sweeps matter from the galactic disk. The superwind region in\nthe halo is filled with a multi-phase gas with hot, warm, cool, and\nrelativistic components. The shocks associated with the superwind of starbursts\nand the turbulent gas region of the bubble inflated by them might accelerate\ncosmic rays up to high energies. In this work we calculate the cosmic ray\nproduction associated with the superwind using parameters that correspond to\nthe nearby southern starburst galaxy NGC 253, which has been suggested as a\npotential accelerator of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We evaluate the\nefficiency of both diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and stochastic diffusive\nacceleration (SDA) in the superwind of NGC 253. We estimate the distribution of\nboth hadrons and leptons and calculate the corresponding spectral energy\ndistributions of photons. We find that the strong mass load of the superwind,\nrecently determined through ALMA observations, strongly attenuates the\nefficiency of DSA in NGC 253, whereas SDA is constrained by the age of the\nstarburst. We conclude that NGC 253 and similar starbursts can only accelerate\niron nuclei beyond $\\sim10^{18}$ eV under very special conditions. If the\ncentral region of the galaxy harbors a starved supermassive black hole of\n$\\sim10^6$ $M_{\\odot}$, as suggested by some recent observations, a\ncontribution in the range $10^{18}-10^{19}$ eV can be present for accretion\nrates $\\dot{m}\\sim10^{-3}$ in Eddington units.

However BDMPSZ also\npredicts an azimuthal broadening of di-jets also proportional to $\\hat{q}L$\nwhich has so far not been observed. The broadening should produce a larger\n$k_T$ in A$+$A than in p$+$p collisions. This presentation introduces the\nobservation that the $k_T$ measured in p$+$p collisions for di-hadrons with\n$p_{Tt}$ and $p_{Ta}$ must be reduced to compensate for the energy loss of both\nthe trigger and away parent partons when comparing to the $k_T$ measured with\nthe same di-hadron $p_{Tt}$ and $p_{Ta}$ in A$+$A collisions. This idea is\napplied to a recent STAR di-hadron measurement in Au$+$Au at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV, [Phys. Lett. B760 (2016) 689], with result\n$<{\\hat{q}L}>=2.1\\pm 0.6$ GeV$^2$.

We consider scaled Milky Way-like potentials\nincluding a disk, bulge, and halo with a range of halo velocities V_H = 50-300\nkm/s, and streamline footpoints with radii in the disk R_0=1-16 kpc at height 1\nkpc.

Cosmic ray streaming at the Alfv\\'en speed enables the\neffective sound speed C_eff to increase from the footpoint to a critical point\nwhere C_eff,c = u_c ~ V_H; this differs from thermal winds in which C_eff\ndecreases outward.

High dimensional quantum\nsystem is a potential candidate for increasing the capacity of single photon.\nHowever, due to the difficulty in manipulating and measuring high dimensional\nquantum systems, the experimental high dimensional QKD is still at its infancy.\nHere we propose a sort of practical high-speed high dimensional QKD using\npartial mutual unbiased basis (PMUB) of photon's orbital angular momentum\n(OAM).

The new method is conservative for mass, momentum\nand total energy and in multiple space dimensions it is constructed in such a\nway as to respect the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field exactly,\nalso in the presence of resistive effects. This is possible via the use of\nmulti-dimensional Riemann solvers on an appropriately staggered grid for the\ntime evolution of the magnetic field and a double curl formulation of the\nresistive terms. The new semi-implicit method for the MHD equations proposed\nhere discretizes all terms related to the pressure in the momentum equation and\nthe total energy equation implicitly, making again use of a properly staggered\ngrid for pressure and velocity. The time step of the scheme is restricted by a\nCFL condition based only on the fluid velocity and the Alfv\\'en wave speed and\nis not based on the speed of the magnetosonic waves. Our new method is\nparticularly well-suited for low Mach number flows and for the incompressible\nlimit of the MHD equations, for which it is well-known that explicit\ndensity-based Godunov-type finite volume solvers become increasingly\ninefficient and inaccurate due to the increasingly stringent CFL condition and\nthe wrong scaling of the numerical viscosity in the incompressible limit. We\nshow a relevant MHD test problem in the low Mach number regime where the new\nsemi-implicit algorithm is a factor of 50 faster than a traditional explicit\nfinite volume method, which is a very significant gain in terms of\ncomputational efficiency. However, our numerical results confirm that our new\nmethod performs well also for classical MHD test cases with strong shocks. In\nthis sense our new scheme is a true all Mach number flow solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 22:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

One major drawback of such strategy is the lacking\ndelineation of visual objects when training samples are limited. To grapple\nwith this issue, we introduce a multi-view receptive field fully convolutional\nneural network (MV-FCN) that harness recent seminal ideas, such as, fully\nconvolutional structure, inception modules, and residual networking. Therefrom,\nwe implement a system in an encoder-decoder fashion that subsumes a core and\ntwo complementary feature flow paths. The model exploits inception modules at\nearly and late stages with three different sizes of receptive fields to capture\ninvariance at various scales. The features learned in the encoding phase are\nfused with appropriate feature maps in the decoding phase through residual\nconnections for achieving enhanced spatial representation. These multi-view\nreceptive fields and residual feature connections are expected to yield highly\ngeneralized features for an accurate pixel-wise FG region identification. It\nis, then, trained with database specific exemplary segmentations to predict\ndesired FG objects.\n  The comparative experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets validate\nthat the proposed model achieves very competitive performance with the prior-\nand state-of-the-art algorithms. We also report that how well a transfer\nlearning approach can be useful to enhance the performance of our proposed\nMV-FCN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 23:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

It was shown that the\nperformance gap between the quantum limit and that of ideal continuum\nimage-plane direct detection is the largest for highly sub-Rayleigh separation\nof the objects, and that a pre-detection mode sorting could attain the quantum\nlimit. Here we extend this to a more general problem of estimating the length\nof an incoherently radiating extended (line) object. We find, as expected by\nthe Rayleigh criterion, the Fisher information (FI) per integrated photon\nvanishes in the limit of small length for ideal image plane direct detection.\nConversely, for a Hermite-Gaussian (HG) pre-detection mode sorter, this\nnormalized FI does not decrease with decreasing object length, similar to the\ntwo point object case. However, unlike in the two-object problem, the FI per\nphoton of both detection strategies gradually decreases as the object length\ngreatly exceeds the Rayleigh limit, due to the relative inefficiency of\ninformation provided by photons emanating from near the center of the object\nabout its length. We evaluate the quantum Fisher information per unit\nintegrated photons and find that the HG mode sorter exactly achieves this limit\nat all values of the object length. Further, a simple binary mode sorter\nmaintains the advantage of the full mode sorter at highly sub-Rayleigh length.\nIn addition to this FI analysis, we quantify improvement in terms of the actual\nmean squared error of the length estimate. Finally, we consider the effect of\nimperfect mode sorting, and show that the performance improvement over direct\ndetection is robust over a range of sub-Rayleigh lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 23:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

In contrast, PhaseMax is a novel convex\nrelaxation that does not increase the number of unknowns. Instead it relies on\nan initial estimate of the true signal which must be externally provided. In\nthis paper, we investigate the required number of measurements for exact\nrecovery of the signal in the large system limit and when the linear\nmeasurement matrix is random with iid standard normal entries. If $n$ denotes\nthe dimension of the unknown complex signal and $m$ the number of phaseless\nmeasurements, then in the large system limit, $\\frac{m}{n} >\n\\frac{4}{\\cos^2(\\theta)}$ measurements is necessary and sufficient to recover\nthe signal with high probability, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the\ninitial estimate and the true signal. Our result indicates a sharp phase\ntransition in the asymptotic regime which matches the empirical result in\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 01:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

In addition to structural similarity loss\nfunction, the produced descriptions are used as opposing labels with multiple\ndescription distance loss function to regularize the training of MDGN network.\nThese losses guarantee that the generated description images are structurally\nsimilar yet finely diverse.

A\nnovel, mechanistic pore-scale model simulates flooding of a sample under fixed\nconfining stress, showing that increasing stress inhibits permeability\nenhancement, increasing the injected volume required to reach a certain\npermeability, in agreement with recent experiments. We explain this behavior by\nstress concentration downstream, in the less dissolved (hence stiffer) region.\nAs this region is also less conductive, even its small compaction has a strong\nbottleneck effect that curbs the permeability.\n  Our results also elucidate that the impact of stress depends on the\ndissolution regime. Under wormholing conditions (slow injection, i.e. high\nDamkohler, $Da$), the development of a sharp dissolution front and high\nporosity contrast accentuates the bottleneck effect. This reduces transport\nheterogeneity, promoting wormhole competition. Once the outlet starts eroding,\nthe extreme focusing of transport and hence dissolution--characteristic of\nwormholing--becomes dominant, diminishing the bottleneck effect and hence the\nimpact of stress. In contrast, at low $Da$, incomplete reaction upstream allows\nthe reagent to traverse the sample, causing a more uniform dissolution. The\ncontinuous dissolution and its partial counteraction by compaction downstream\nprovides a steady, gradual increase in the effect of stress. Consequently, the\nimpact of stress is more pronounced at high $Da$ during early stages (low\npermeability), and at low $Da$ close to breakthrough.

A lucid demonstration of this concept is provided by the study of\nvesicle deformation and dielectrophoresis under axisymmetric quadrupole\nelectric field. Small deformation theory incorporating the Maxwell stress\napproach is used (employing area and volume conservation constraints) to\nestimate the dielectrophoretic velocity. The entropic and enthalpic tensions\nare implemented to understand vesicle electrohydrodynamics in low and high\ntension limits. The shapes obtained using the entropic and the enthalpic\napproaches, show significant differences.

Nonetheless, there is no theoretical argument\nlinking the fractional difference operator with the presence of long memory in\nreal data. In this regard, one of the most predominant theoretical explanations\nfor the presence of long memory is cross-sectional aggregation of persistent\nmicro units. Yet, the type of processes obtained by cross-sectional aggregation\ndiffers from the one due to fractional differencing. Thus, this paper develops\nfast algorithms to generate and forecast long memory by cross-sectional\naggregation. Moreover, it is shown that the antipersistent phenomenon that\narises for negative degrees of memory in the fractional difference literature\nis not present for cross-sectionally aggregated processes. Pointedly, while the\nautocorrelations for the fractional difference operator are negative for\nnegative degrees of memory by construction, this restriction does not apply to\nthe cross-sectional aggregated scheme.

The key idea of ROP is that the\nsecondary transmitter harvests energy from the primary signal, then modulates\nits information bits to the primary signal, and reflects the modulated signal\nto the secondary receiver without violating the primary system's interference\nrequirement. Compared with the conventional spectrum sharing model, the\nsecondary system in the proposed ROP not only utilizes the spectrum of the\nprimary system but also takes advantage of the primary signal to harvest energy\nand to carry its information. In this paper, we investigate the performance of\nsuch a spectrum sharing system under fading channels. To be specific, we\nmaximize the ergodic capacity of the secondary system by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit power of the primary signal and the reflection coefficient of the\nsecondary ambient backscatter.

This paper aims to tackle\nthis challenge by applying the physical layer security technique. We consider\nboth the downlink and uplink UAV communications with a ground node, namely\nUAV-to-ground (U2G) and ground-to-UAV (G2U) communications, respectively,\nsubject to a potential eavesdropper on the ground. In contrast to the existing\nliterature on wireless physical layer security only with ground nodes at fixed\nor quasi-static locations, we exploit the high mobility of the UAV to\nproactively establish favorable and degraded channels for the legitimate and\neavesdropping links, respectively, via its trajectory design. We formulate new\nproblems to maximize the average secrecy rates of the U2G and G2U\ntransmissions, respectively, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and the\ntransmit power of the legitimate transmitter over a given flight period of the\nUAV. Although the formulated problems are non-convex, we propose iterative\nalgorithms to solve them efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent\nand successive convex optimization methods. Specifically, the transmit power\nand UAV trajectory are each optimized with the other being fixed in an\nalternating manner, until the algorithms converge.

In the fly's visual system, a class of specific neurons,\ncalled small target motion detectors (STMDs), have been identified as showing\nexquisite selectivity for small target motion. Some of the STMDs have also\ndemonstrated directional selectivity which means these STMDs respond strongly\nonly to their preferred motion direction. Directional selectivity is an\nimportant property of these STMD neurons which could contribute to tracking\nsmall targets such as mates in flight. However, little has been done on\nsystematically modeling these directional selective STMD neurons. In this\npaper, we propose a directional selective STMD-based neural network (DSTMD) for\nsmall target detection in a cluttered background. In the proposed neural\nnetwork, a new correlation mechanism is introduced for direction selectivity\nvia correlating signals relayed from two pixels. Then, a lateral inhibition\nmechanism is implemented on the spatial field for size selectivity of STMD\nneurons.

The coupled equations for vesicle orientation\nand shape evolution are derived theoretically and the resulting nonlinear\nequations are handled numerically to generate relevant phase diagrams that\ndemonstrate the effect of electrical parameters on the different dynamical\nregimes such as tank-treading (TT), trembling (TR), and tumbling (TU). It is\nfound that while the electric Mason number (Mn) which represents the relative\nstrength of the electrical forces to the shear forces, promotes TT regime, the\nresponse itself is found to be sensitive to the applied frequency as well as\nthe conductivity ratio. While higher outer conductivity promotes orientation\nalong the flow axis, orientation along the electric field is favoured when the\ninner conductivity is higher. Similarly, a switch of orientation from the\ndirection of the electric field to the direction of flow is possible by a mere\nchange of frequency when the outer conductivity is higher. Interestingly, in\nsome cases, a coupling between electric field induced deformation and shear can\nresult in the system admitting an intermediate TU regime while attaining the TT\nregime at high Mn.

Accurate measurement and prediction of work zone\ntravel time can help travelers make better routing decisions and therefore\nmitigate its impact. Historically, data used for travel time analyses comes\nfrom fixed loop detectors, which are expensive to install and maintain. With\nconnected vehicle technology, such as Vehicle-to-Infrastructure, portable\nroadside unit (RSU) can be located in and around a work zone segment to\ncommunicate with the vehicles and collect traffic data. A PARAMICS simulation\nmodel for a prototypical freeway work zone in a connected vehicle environment\nwas built to test this idea using traffic demand data from NY State Route 104.\nFor the simulation, twelve RSUs were placed along the work zone segment and\nsixteen variables were extracted from the simulation results to explore travel\ntime estimation and prediction. For the travel time analysis, four types of\nmodels were constructed, including linear regression, multivariate adaptive\nregression splines (MARS), stepwise regression and elastic net. The results\nshow that the modeling approaches under consideration have similar performance\nin terms of the Root of Mean Square Error (RMSE), which provides an opportunity\nfor model selection based on additional factors including the number and\nlocations of the RSUs according to the significant variables identified in the\nvarious models. Among the four approaches, the stepwise regression model only\nneeds variables from two RSUs: one placed sufficiently upstream of the work\nzone and one at the end of the work zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 01:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

For studying\nthis problem, a real-world signalized intersection in Buffalo, New York was\nchosen, which has two through lanes and one short shared (through and\nright-turn) lane. At the downstream of the intersection are two following\non-ramps, one to the highway I-290 West and the other to I-290 East.

Simulated time-series were derived from a network model of\nfully connected discrete-time stochastic excitable neurons. Monofractal and\nmultifractal analyses were applied to neuronal gain time-series. Fractal\nscaling was greatest in networks with a mid-range of neuronal plasticity,\nversus extremely high or low levels of plasticity. Peak fractal scaling\ncorresponded closely to additional indices of criticality, including average\nbranching ratio. Networks exhibited multifractal structure, or multiple scaling\nrelationships. Multifractal spectra around peak criticality exhibited elongated\nright tails, suggesting that the fractal structure is relatively insensitive to\nhigh-amplitude local fluctuations. Networks near critical states exhibited\nmid-range multifractal spectra width and tail length, which is consistent with\nliterature suggesting that networks poised at quasi-critical states must be\nstable enough to maintain organization but unstable enough to be adaptable.\nLastly, fractal analyses may offer additional information about critical state\ndynamics of networks by indicating scales of influence as networks approach\ncritical states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 22:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}
