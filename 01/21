This paper is in the continuation of\ntheir study in which we solve two open problems raised by Pott et al. and\npartially solve an open problem raised by the same authors. Firstly, we prove\nthat for a vectorial function, the property of having the maximum number of\nbent components is invariant under the so-called CCZ equivalence. Secondly, we\nprove the non-existence of APN plateaued having the maximum number of bent\ncomponents. In particular, quadratic APN functions cannot have the maximum\nnumber of bent components. Finally, we present some sufficient conditions that\nthe vectorial function defined from $\\mathbb{F}_{2^{2k}}$ to\n$\\mathbb{F}_{2^{2k}}$ by its univariate representation:\n  $$ \\alpha\nx^{2^i}\\left(x+x^{2^k}+\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{\\rho}\\gamma^{(j)}x^{2^{t_j}}\n  +\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{\\rho}\\gamma^{(j)}x^{2^{t_j+k}}\\right)$$ has the maximum\nnumber of {components bent functions, where $\\rho\\leq k$}.

Standard image formation algorithms for this type of setup suffer from\nunder-sampling due to the sparse detector array, blurring due to the finite\nimpulse response of the detection system, and artifacts due to the limited\ndetection view. To address these issues, in this paper we develop a new direct\nand non-iterative image reconstruction framework using deep learning.

Both subnetworks contain free parameters that are adjusted in the\ntraining phase. As demonstrated by simulation and experiment, the DALnet is\ncapable of producing high-resolution projection images of 3D structures at a\nframe rate of over 50 images per second on a standard PC with NVIDIA TITAN Xp\nGPU.

However, the\nultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by such stars can erode and modify planetary\natmospheres over time, drastically affecting their habitability. Thus knowledge\nof the UV evolution of low-mass stars is critical for interpreting the\nevolutionary history of any orbiting planets. Shkolnik & Barman (2014) used\nphotometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) to show how UV emission\nevolves for early type M stars ($>$0.35 $M_\\odot$). In this paper, we extend\ntheir work to include both a larger sample of low-mass stars with known ages as\nwell as M stars with lower masses. We find clear evidence that mid- and\nlate-type M stars (0.08-0.35 $M_\\odot$) do not follow the same UV evolutionary\ntrend as early-Ms. Lower mass M stars retain high levels of UV activity up to\nfield ages, with only a factor of 4 decrease on average in GALEX NUV and FUV\nflux density between young ($<$50 Myr) and old ($\\sim$5 Gyr) stars, compared to\na factor of 11 and 31 for early-Ms in NUV and FUV, respectively. We also find\nthat the FUV/NUV flux density ratio, which can affect the photochemistry of\nimportant planetary biosignatures, is mass and age-dependent for early Ms, but\nremains relatively constant for the mid- and late-type Ms in our sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 18:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

The mass ratio of the components\n(q) was found to be 0.43$\\pm$0.01, while the inclination ($i$) of the system\n80.56+-0.01 deg. Additionally, the data were separated into 35 subsets to model\nthe sinusoidal variation due to the rotational modulation, using the SPOTMODEL\nprogram, as the light curve analysis indicated the chromospherically active\nsecondary component. It was found that there are generally two spotted areas,\nwhose radii, longitudes and latitudes are rapidly changing, located around the\nlatitudes of +50 deg and +90 deg on the active component. Moreover, 113 flares\nwere detected and their parameters were computed from the available data. The\nOne Phase Exponential Association function model was derived from the\nparameters of these flares. Using the regression calculations, the Plateau\nvalue was found to be 1.9815+-0.1177, while the half-life value was computed as\n3977.2 s. In addition, the flare frequency (N1) - the flare number per hour,\nwas estimated to be 0.00362 1/h, while flare frequency (N2) - the\nflare-equivalent duration emitted per hour, was computed as 0.00001. Finally,\nthe times of eclipses were computed for 278 minima of the light curves, whose\nanalysis indicated that the chromosphere activity nature of the system causes\nsome effects on these minima times. Comparing the chromospheric activity\npatterns with the analogues of the secondary component, it is seen that the\nmagnetic activity level is remarkably low. However, it is still at the expected\nlevel according to the B-V color index of 0.643 mag for the secondary\ncomponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 18:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

The synchrotron emission of jets can\nbe highly linearly polarised, depending on the configuration of the magnetic\nfield. Optical and infrared (OIR) polarimetric observations of X-ray binaries\nare presented in this brief review. The OIR polarimetric signature of\nrelativistic jets is detected at levels of ~ 1-10 %, similar to AGN cores. This\nreveals that the magnetic geometry in the compact jets may be similar for\nsupermassive and stellar-mass BHs.

These measurements probe\nthe physical conditions in the accretion (out)flow and demonstrate a new way of\nconnecting inflow and outflow, using both rapid timing and polarisation.\nVariations in polarisation could be due to rapid changes of the ordering of the\nmagnetic field in the emitting region, or in one case, flares from individual\nejections or collisions between ejecta.

Nevertheless, the\nlatency-sensitive nature of memory-resident services makes seamless integration\nof SCM in servers questionable. In this paper, we ask the question of how best\nto introduce SCM for such servers to improve overall performance/cost over\nexisting DRAM-only architectures. We first show that even with the most\noptimistic latency projections for SCM, the higher memory access latency\nresults in prohibitive performance degradation. However, we find that\ndeployment of a modestly sized high-bandwidth 3D stacked DRAM cache makes the\nperformance of an SCM-mostly memory system competitive. The high degree of\nspatial locality that memory-resident services exhibit not only simplifies the\nDRAM cache's design as page-based, but also enables the amortization of\nincreased SCM access latencies and the mitigation of SCM's read/write latency\ndisparity.\n  We identify the set of memory hierarchy design parameters that plays a key\nrole in the performance and cost of a memory system combining an SCM technology\nand a 3D stacked DRAM cache. We then introduce a methodology to drive\nprovisioning for each of these design parameters under a target\nperformance/cost goal. Finally, we use our methodology to derive concrete\nresults for specific SCM technologies. With PCM as a case study, we show that a\ntwo bits/cell technology hits the performance/cost sweet spot, reducing the\nmemory subsystem cost by 40% while keeping performance within 3% of the best\nperforming DRAM-only system, whereas single-level and triple-level cell\norganizations are impractical for use as memory replacements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2018 20:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 13:18:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 17:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 19:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

In\nthis paper, we introduce a new family of matrices over finite fields that we\ncall \\emph{Quasi-Binary and Quasi-Orthogonal Matrices}.

Does the high-frequency case, n = 1, always lead to the best performance?\nWhat are the effects of accrued interest and transaction costs? First, we\nprovide rather complete answers to these questions for the important special\ncase when X(k) in {-1,1} is a Bernoulli random variable with probability p that\nX(k) = 1.

The\nsecond conjecture involves the technical condition which we call the sufficient\nattractiveness inequality.

This\npaper addresses an additional dispersion mechanism which is induced by\ngravitational settling and is a result of the coupling between the modified\nparticle concentration (the change of particle number density due to settling)\nand the lateral velocity profiles at the subscale. Heavy particles that move in\nareas of low horizontal velocity (e.g., near solid surfaces and wake regions)\nsettle closer to the release source as compared to particles in high velocity\nregions. The macroscopic concentration field of such suspensions is influenced\nby the ratio between the settling velocity and the subscale distribution of the\nhorizontal velocities. The objective of the study is to isolate and quantify\nthis type of dispersion using controlled flow scenarios. We used a Taylor brush\ngeometry (an array of vertical grooves) to numerically solve the flow.\nParticles were released from a vertical plane, generating a constant flux. The\nsubscale Eulerian concentration was compiled from simulated trajectories and\nthen spatially averaged to generate macroscopic concentration fields. The\nresults show that this settling-induced dispersion is significant in regions\nnear the source and that it cannot be modeled using Fick's law type of\nformulations. A parametric investigation shows that the location of the highest\ndispersion flux is linearly proportional to both the groove spacing and depth.\nA proposed model that estimates this location is used to evaluate where\nsettling-induced dispersion should not be ignored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 00:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

Yet, practical data cleaning tools need to\nincorporate statistical reasoning to be effective in real-world data cleaning\ntasks. Motivated by these empirical successes, we propose a formal framework\nfor unclean databases, where two types of statistical knowledge are\nincorporated: The first represents a belief of how intended (clean) data is\ngenerated, and the second represents a belief of how noise is introduced in the\nactual observed database instance. To capture this noisy channel model, we\nintroduce the concept of a Probabilistic Unclean Database (PUD), a triple that\nconsists of a probabilistic database that we call the intention, a\nprobabilistic data transformator that we call the realization and captures how\nnoise is introduced, and a dirty observed database instance that we call the\nobservation. We define three computational problems in the PUD framework:\ncleaning (infer the most probable clean instance given a PUD), probabilistic\nquery answering (compute the probability of an answer tuple over the unclean\nobserved instance), and learning (estimate the most likely intention and\nrealization models of a PUD given a collection of training data). We illustrate\nthe PUD framework on concrete representations of the intention and realization,\nshow that they generalize traditional concepts of repairs such as cardinality\nand value repairs, draw connection to consistent query answering, and prove\ntractability results.

It is well known that a piecewise affine policy is optimal\nalthough the number of pieces can be exponentially large. A significant\nchallenge in designing a practical piecewise affine policy is constructing good\npieces of the uncertainty set. Here we address this challenge by introducing a\nnew framework in which the uncertainty set is \"approximated\" by a \"dominating\"\nsimplex. The corresponding policy is then based on a mapping from the\nuncertainty set to the simplex. Although our piecewise affine policy has\nexponentially many pieces, it can be computed efficiently by solving a compact\nlinear program given the dominating simplex. Furthermore, we can find the\ndominating simplex in a closed form if the uncertainty set satisfies some\nsymmetries and can be computed using a MIP in general. The performance of our\npolicy is significantly better than the affine policy for many important\nuncertainty sets, such as ellipsoids and norm-balls, both theoretically and\nnumerically. For instance, for hypersphere uncertainty set, our piecewise\naffine policy can be computed by an LP and gives a $O(m^{1/4})$-approximation\nwhereas the affine policy requires us to solve a second order cone program and\nhas a worst-case performance bound of $O(\\sqrt m)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 02:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

This sinusoid wave can then undergo the Fast\nFourier Transform to obtain a spectrum of frequencies that represents the\nsinusoid wave. This spectrum can then serve as a signature of the spatial\ncomplexity [an index] within the polyp. By overlaying vertical lines that\nradiate from the bottom middle [like a fold-out fan] of an image of a polyp\nstained by hematoxylin and eosin, the image is segmented into sectors. Each\nvertical line also forms an angle with the horizontal axis of the image,\nranging from 0 degrees to 180 degrees rising counter clockwise. Each vertical\nline will intersect with various features of the polyp [border of lumens,\nborder of epithelial lining]. Each of these intersections is a point that can\nbe characterized by its distance from the origin [this distance is also a\nmagnitude of that point]. Thus, each intersection between radial line and polyp\nfeature can be mapped by polar coordinates [radius length, angle measure]. By\nsumming the distance of all points along the same radial line, each radial line\nthat divides the image becomes one value. Plotting these values [y variable]\nagainst the angle of each radial line from the horizontal axis [x variable]\nresults in a sinusoid wave consisting of discrete points. This method is\nreferred to as the Linearized Compressed Polar Coordinates [LCPC] Transform.\nThe LCPC transform, in conjunction with the Fast Fourier Transform, can reduce\nthe complexity of visually hidden histological grades in colon polyps into\ncategories of similar wave frequencies [each histological grade has a signature\nconsisting of a handful of frequencies].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 02:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

Our focus is on type N spacetimes compatible with the\ncosmological constants provided by the bigravity interaction potential, and\nparticularly in the single class known by allowing at least a Killing symmetry:\nthe AdS waves. They have the advantage of being represented by a generalized\nKerr-Schild transformation from AdS spacetime. This means a notorious\nsimplification in bigravity by allowing to straightforwardly compute any power\nof its interaction square root matrix, opening the door to explore physically\nmeaningful exact configurations. For these exact gravitational waves the\ncomplex dynamical structure of bigravity decomposes into elementary exact\nmassless or massive excitations propagating on AdS. We use a complexified\nformulation of the Euler-Darboux equations to provide for the first time the\ngeneral solutions to the massive version of the Siklos equation which rules the\nresulting AdS-waves dynamics, using an integral representation originally due\nto Poisson. Inspired in this progress we tackle the subtle problem on how\nmatter couples to bigravity and concretely if this occurs through a composite\nmetric, which is hard to handle in a general setting. Surprisingly, the\nKerr-Schild ansatz brings again a huge simplification in how the related\nenergy-momentum tensors are calculated. This allows us to explicitly\ncharacterize AdS waves supported in one case by a massless free scalar field\nand by a wavefront-homogeneous Maxwell field in another. Considering the most\ngeneral allowed Maxwell source instead is a highly nontrivial task, that we\naccomplish by exploiting again the complexified Euler-Darboux description and\ntaking advantage of the classical Riemann method.

It is demonstrated theoretically that the rotation of the\naxisymmetric disk centered on an AV spanner is mainly driven by the exerted\nradiation torque without the contribution of the OAM transfer. The radiation\ntorque on a small-radius object is inversely associated with the topological\ncharge in the center of the AV spanner, and it is enhanced significantly for a\nlarger AV with a higher topological charge. The special case of the radiation\ntorque proportional to the topological charge might be realized when the disk\nradius is much larger than the wavelength, in which case the acoustic power of\nthe AV spanner can be absorbed as much as possible. With the established\nsixteen-source experimental setup, the radial pressure distributions of AVs\nwith different topological charges measured at the frequency of 1.3 kHz in air\nagree well with the simulations. The topological-charge dependence of the\nradiation torque for AVs is also verified by the quantitative\nlaser-displacement (angle) measurements for disks with different radii. The\nfavorable results demonstrate that, for the object covering the vortex center\nof an AV spanner, the total OAM transfer might be 0 and the object rotation is\ncontributed by the acting moments. Thus, the radiation torque of an AV spanner\nis more applicable than the OAM for describing the driving capability of object\nrotation, and it can be used as an effective tool in clinical applications to\nnoninvasively manipulate objects with a feature size at the wavelength-scale\n(e.g. kidney stone in lithotripsy) inside body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 07:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

Inclusion of nominal\ninformation in objects of NOOP and asserting that type inheritance in\nstatically-typed OO programming languages is an inherently nominal notion allow\nreadily proving that type inheritance and subtyping are completely identified\nin these languages. This conclusion is in full agreement with intuitions of\ndevelopers and language designers of these OO languages, and contrary to the\nbelief that \"inheritance is not subtyping,\" which came from assuming\nnon-nominal (a.k.a., structural) models of OOP.\n  To motivate the construction of NOOP, this paper briefly presents the\nbenefits of nominal-typing to mainstream OO developers and OO language\ndesigners, as compared to structural-typing.

Many theoretical calculations have shown ENAQT, but the\nexplanations for its origin differ, and a universal explanation has been\nelusive. Here we demonstrate a universal origin for ENAQT in quantum networks\nwith a dephasing environment, based on a relation between exciton current and\noccupation within a Markovian open quantum system approach. We show that ENAQT\nappears due to two competing processes, namely the tendency of dephasing to\nmake the exciton population uniform, and the formation of an exciton density\ngradient, defined by the source and the sink. Furthermore, we find a geometric\ncondition on the network for the appearance of ENAQT, relevant to natural and\nartificial systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 09:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

Therefore, systematic mapping studies are becoming increasingly\nimportant in security engineering. This chapter provides methodological support\nfor systematic mapping studies in security engineering based on examples from\npublished security engineering papers.

Using\nmobile robots for gas detection has several advantages and can reduce danger\nfor humans. In our work, we address the problem of planning a path for a mobile\nrobotic platform equipped with a remote gas sensor, which minimizes the time to\ndetect all gas sources in a given environment. We cast this problem as a\ncoverage planning problem by defining a basic sensing operation -- a scan with\nthe remote gas sensor -- as the field of \"view\" of the sensor. Given the\ncomputing effort required by previously proposed offline approaches, in this\npaper we suggest a online coverage algorithm, called Next-Best-Smell, adapted\nfrom the Next-Best-View class of exploration algorithms. Our algorithm\nevaluates candidate locations with a global utility function, which combines\nutility values for travel distance, information gain, and sensing time, using\nMulti-Criteria Decision Making.

The MPI pressure\nderives from consideration of an idealized thermodynamic cycle, while the MPI\nvelocity additionally requires information about real-time power and heat flows\nwithin the storm. Recently MPI velocity was proposed to be a substantial\noverestimate (by 10-30 percent) presumably neglecting the power needed to lift\nprecipitating water (the gravitational power of precipitation). This conclusion\ndid not involve a theoretical analysis of the MPI concept but was based on\nobserved hurricane rainfall to estimate gravitational power of precipitation.\nHowever, since the MPI pressure estimate does explicitly account for lifting\nwater, and the MPI velocity derives from this pressure, the question arises\nwhether a correction to MPI velocity is required.

It is shown that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium, which is the\nstatic state of the wireless power charging network. A distributed power\nallocation algorithm is proposed to compute the Nash equilibrium of the game.\nThe main result of the paper consists of rigorous analysis of the distributed\nalgorithm for power allocation. The algorithm is shown to converge to Nash\nequilibrium of the game with exponentially convergence rate for arbitrary\ninitial value with synchronous scheduling. Moreover, the distributed algorithm\nis also convergence guaranteed with asynchronous scheduling under communication\ndelay and packet drops. Numerical simulations prove the correctness of the\nanalysis and demonstrate the fast convergence of the algorithm and the\nrobustness to synchronous scheduling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 15:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

In the solar and extended scene community, the\nimportance of the accuracy (bias error due to peak-locking, quantisation or\nsampling) of the centroid determination was identified and solutions proposed.\nBut these solutions only allow partial bias corrections. To date, no systematic\nstudy of the bias error was conducted. This article bridges the gap by\nquantifying the bias error for different correlation peak-finding algorithms\nand types of sub-aperture images and by proposing a practical solution to\nminimize its effects. Four classes of sub-aperture images (point source,\nelongated laser guide star, crowded field and solar extended scene) together\nwith five types of peak-finding algorithms (1D parabola, the centre of gravity,\nGaussian, 2D quadratic polynomial and pyramid) are considered, in a variety of\nsignal-to-noise conditions. The best performing peak-finding algorithm depends\non the sub-aperture image type, but none is satisfactory to both bias and\nrandom errors. A practical solution is proposed that relies on the\nanti-symmetric response of the bias to the sub-pixel position of the true\ncentre. The solution decreases the bias by a factor of ~7 to values of < 0.02\npix. The computational cost is typically twice of current cross-correlation\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 15:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Objective: We\nevaluated an architecture documentation viewpoint to address the concerns of a\nSoS architect about a constituent system, to support SoS design and analysis\ninvolving that constituent system. Method: We performed an expert review of\ndocumentation produced by applying the viewpoint to a system, using the active\nreview method.

Conclusions: We found that the expert panel was unable\nto answer certain questions because the baseline version of the viewpoint had a\ngap in coverage related to relationship of software units of execution (e.g.,\nprocesses or services) to computers and networks.
