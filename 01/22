We obtain the effective field theory of a light scalar\nfield interacting with heavy fields after tracing out the heavy degrees of\nfreedom from the time evolved density matrix. The initial density matrix\ndescribes the light field in its ground state and the heavy fields in\nequilibrium at a common temperature $T$. For $T=0$, we obtain the reduced\ndensity matrix in a perturbative expansion, it reveals an emergent mixed state\nas a consequence of the entanglement between light and heavy fields. We obtain\nthe effective action that determines the time evolution of the \\emph{reduced}\ndensity matrix for the light field in a non-perturbative Dyson resummation of\none-loop correlations of the heavy fields. The Von-Neumann \\emph{entanglement\nentropy} associated with the reduced density matrix is obtained for the\nnon-resonant and resonant cases in the asymptotic long time limit. In the\nnon-resonant case the reduced density matrix displays an \\emph{incipient}\nthermalization albeit with a wave-vector, time and coupling dependent\n\\emph{effective temperature} as a consequence of memory of initial conditions.\nThe entanglement entropy is time independent and is the \\emph{thermal entropy}\nfor this effective, non-equilibrium temperature. In the resonant case the light\nfield fully \\emph{thermalizes} with the heavy fields, the reduced density\nmatrix looses memory of the initial conditions and the entanglement entropy\nbecomes the \\emph{thermal entropy} of the light field. We discuss the relation\nbetween the entanglement entropy ultraviolet divergences and renormalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 16:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 20:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

By analyzing the response of\nImageNet-CNNs and Places-CNNs at different scales we find that both operate in\ndifferent scale ranges, so using the same network for all the scales induces\ndataset bias resulting in limited performance. Thus, adapting the feature\nextractor to each particular scale (i.e. scale-specific CNNs) is crucial to\nimprove recognition, since the objects in the scenes have their specific range\nof scales. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy highly\ndepends on the scale, and that simple yet carefully chosen multi-scale\ncombinations of ImageNet-CNNs and Places-CNNs, can push the state-of-the-art\nrecognition accuracy in SUN397 up to 66.26% (and even 70.17% with deeper\narchitectures, comparable to human performance).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 18:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

Such properties cannot be expressed\ndirectly in the traditional setting of modular deductive verification, but are\namenable to verification through self-composition. This paper presents a\nverification technique dedicated to relational properties in C programs and its\nimplementation in the form of a FRAMA-C plugin called RPP and based on\nself-composition. It supports functions with side effects and recursive\nfunctions. The proposed approach makes it possible to prove a relational\nproperty, to check it at runtime, to generate a counterexample using testing\nand to use it as a hypothesis in the subsequent verification. Our initial\nexperiments on existing benchmarks confirm that the proposed technique is\nhelpful for static and dynamic analysis of relational properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 18:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 13:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

As a case study, we consider a poly(ethylene\nglycol)-coated gold nanoparticle of diameter 1.6~nm excited by a carbon ion in\nthe Bragg peak region in water as well as by more energetic carbon ions. The\ndiffusion equation for low-energy electrons emitted from a finite-size\nspherical source representing the surface of the metal core is solved to obtain\nthe electron number density as a function of radial distance and time.\nInformation on the atomistic structure and composition of the coating is\nobtained from molecular dynamics simulations performed with the MBN Explorer\nsoftware package. Two mechanisms of low-energy electron production by the\nmetallic core are considered: the relaxation of plasmon excitations and\ncollective excitations of valence $d$ electrons in individual atoms of gold.\nDiffusion coefficients and characteristic lifetimes of electrons propagating in\ngold, water, and poly(ethylene glycol) are obtained from relativistic partial\nwave analysis and the dielectric formalism, respectively. On this basis, the\nnumber of electrons released through the organic coating into the surrounding\naqueous medium and the number of hydroxyl radicals produced are evaluated. The\nlargest increase of the radical yield due to low-energy electrons is observed\nwhen the nanoparticle is excited by an ion with energy significantly exceeding\nthat in the Bragg peak region. It is also shown that the water content of the\ncoating, especially near the surface of the metal core, is crucial for the\nproduction of hydroxyl radicals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 21:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 10:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 21:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Under the assumption that indices reflect the\nunderlying economy of a country, such a ranking indicates which countries exert\nthe most economic influence in an examined subset of the global economy. The\nproposed method represents the indices as nodes in a directed graph, where the\nedges' weights are estimates of the pair-wise causal influences, quantified\nusing the directed information functional. This method facilitates using a\nrelatively small number of samples from each index. The indices are then ranked\naccording to their net-flow in the estimated graph (sum of the incoming weights\nsubtracted from the sum of outgoing weights). Daily and minute-by-minute data\nfrom nine indices (three from Asia, three from Europe and three from the US)\nwere analyzed. The analysis of daily data indicates that the US indices are the\nmost influential, which is consistent with intuition that the indices\nrepresenting larger economies usually exert more influence. Yet, it is also\nshown that an index representing a small economy can strongly influence an\nindex representing a large economy if the smaller economy is indicative of a\nlarger phenomenon. Finally, it is shown that while inter-region interactions\ncan be captured using daily data, intra-region interactions require more\nfrequent samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 21:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

We solved numerical\nhydrodynamics equations in the thin-disk limit, which are modified to include a\ndust component consisting of two parts: sub-micron-sized dust and grown dust\nwith a maximum radius a_r. The former is strictly coupled to the gas, while the\nlatter interacts with the gas via friction. The conversion of small to grown\ndust, dust growth, and dust self-gravity are also considered. We found that the\nprocess of dust growth known for the older protoplanetary phase also holds for\nthe embedded phase of disk evolution. The dust growth efficiency depends on the\nradial distance from the star - a_r is largest in the inner disk and gradually\ndeclines with radial distance. In the inner disk, a_r is limited by the dust\nfragmentation barrier. The process of small-to-grown dust conversion is very\nfast once the disk is formed. The total mass of grown dust in the disk (beyond\n1 AU) reaches tens or even hundreds of Earth masses already in the embedded\nphase of star formation and even a greater amount of grown dust drifts in the\ninner, unresolved 1 AU of the disk. Dust does not usually grow to radii greater\nthan a few cm.

An\napplied magnetic field creates two Majorana bound states: a vortex Majorana\nstate localized inside a vortex core and an exterior Majorana state localized\nalong a circle centered at the vortex core. We calculate the spin-resolved\nlocal density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate that the shrinking of the radius\nof the exterior Majorana state, predicted in Ref. [R. S. Akzyanov et al., Phys.\nRev. B 94, 125428 (2016)], under a strong magnetic field can be seen in LDOS\nwithout smeared out by non-zero-energy states. The spin-resolved LDOS further\nreveals that the spin of the exterior Majorana state is strongly polarized.\nAccordingly, the induced odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs are found to be\nspin-polarized as well. In order to detect the exterior Majorana states,\nhowever, the Fermi energy should be closed to the Dirac point to avoid\ncontributions from continuum levels. We also study a different two-dimensional\ntopological-superconducting system where a two-dimensional electron gas with\nthe spin-orbit coupling is sandwiched between an s-wave superconductor and a\nferromagnetic insulator.

This article investigates\nthe medium access control (MAC) as a means of increasing the viability of the\nspectrum sharing technique. We first quantify the opportunity of spectrum\naccess in a probabilistic manner, a method referred to as opportunity\nprobability (OP). Based on the OP framework, we propose a random MAC algorithm\nin which the access of a node is randomly determined with its own OP value. As\na possible application of our OP based random MAC, we propose a hybrid half\nduplex (HD)/full duplex (FD) communication where each pair decides the\nduplexing mode according to the OP values of the two pair nodes. This approach\nfits well with the spectrum sharing system since it enables a flexible\noperation for the spectrum access according to the spectrum usage level. From\nthe numerical analysis, we validate the feasibility and verify the performance\nenhancements by implementing an FPGA based real-time prototype.

The benefits of normalization can be observed through improving data\nquality and performance, among the other qualities. We explore a new context of\ntechnical debt manifestation, which is linked to ill-normalized databases. This\ndebt can have long-term impact causing systematic degradation of database\nqualities. Such degradation can be liken to accumulated interest on a debt. We\nclaim that debts are likely to materialize for tables below the fourth normal\nform. Practically, achieving fourth normal form for all the tables in the\ndatabase is a costly and idealistic exercise. Therefore, we propose a pragmatic\napproach to prioritize tables that should be normalized to the fourth normal\nform based on the metaphoric debt and interest of the ill-normalized tables,\nobserved on data quality and performance. For data quality, tables are\nprioritized using the risk of data inconsistency metric. Unlike data quality, a\nsuitable metric to estimate the impact of weakly or un-normalized tables on\nperformance is not available. We estimate performance degradation and its costs\nusing Input\\Output (I\\O) cost of the operations performed on the tables and we\npropose a model to estimate this cost for each table. We make use of Modern\nPortfolio Theory to prioritize tables that should be normalized based on the\nestimated I\\O cost and the likely risk of cost accumulation in the future. To\nevaluate our methods, we use a case study from Microsoft, AdventureWorks. The\nresults show that our methods can be effective in reducing normalization debt\nand improving the quality of the database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 08:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

The observations in the optical V -band and NIR J, H and Ks bands\ncarried over 35 epochs during the period October 2016 to April 2017 were used\nto estimate the inner radius of the dusty torus. From a careful reduction and\nanalysis of the data using cross-correlation techniques, we found delayed\nresponses of the J, H and Ks light curves to the V -band light curve. In the\nrest frame of the source, the lags between optical and NIR bands are found to\nbe $27.1^{+13.5}_{-12.0}$ days (V vs. J), $30.4^{+13.9}_{-12.0}$ days (V vs. H)\nand $34.6^{+12.1}_{-9.6}$ days (V vs. K ). The lags between the optical and\ndifferent NIR bands are thus consistent with each other. The measured lags\nindicate that the inner edge of dust torus is located at a distance of 0.029 pc\nfrom the central UV/optical AGN continuum. This is larger than the radius of\nthe broad line region of this object determined from spectroscopic monitoring\nobservations thereby supporting the unification model of AGN.

At\nlarge Hubbard repulsion $U$, the pairing susceptibility is nevertheless very\nlow, because the pairing interaction cannot overcome the suppression of charge\nfluctuations. Using nonequilibrium dynamical mean field simulations of the\ntwo-orbital Hubbard model, we show that out of equilibrium the pairing\nsusceptibility in this large-$U$ regime can be strongly enhanced by creating a\nphoto-induced population of the relevant charge states, and that this\nsusceptibility correlates with the local spin susceptibility. Since a strong\nenhancement of the pairing requires a low kinetic energy of the charge\ncarriers, the phenomenon is supported by the ultra-fast cooling of the\nphoto-doped carriers through the creation of local spin excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 11:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

As a direct consequence, we argue that the\nentangled measurement is not necessary for achieving Heisenberg limit in the\ninformation-theoretic pictures, which is explicitly illustrated for the\nQuantum-Classical parallel strategy of quantum metrology with a separable\nmeasurement employed and the Heisenberg limit saturated in both pictures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 12:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 03:21:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 09:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 11:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 09:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Due to a competetion between aging and rejuvenation during the\nstart up, we show that there is an apparent steady state banding at large times\neven for shear rates such that the steady state flow curve allows for a\nhomogeneous flow. Thus, for aging soft glassy materials, the shear rate for\nachieving homogeneous flow is not necessarily given by the steady-state flow\ncurve.

Then we will review\nexperimental evidence and theoretical understanding of magnetoresistance in an\narchetypal multi-valley system, where the electric conductivity is set by the\nsum of the contributions of different valleys. Bulk bismuth has three valleys\nwith an extremely anisotropic effective mass. As a consequence, the\nmagnetoconductivity in each valley is extremely sensitive to the orientation of\nthe magnetic field. Therefore, a rotating magnetic field plays the role of a\nvalley valve tuning the contribution of each valley to the total conductivity.\nIn addition to this simple semi-classical effect, other phenomena arise in the\nhigh-field limit as a consequence of an intricate Landau spectrum. In the\nvicinity of the quantum limit, the orientation of magnetic field significantly\naffects the distribution of carriers in each valley, namely, the valley\npolarization is induced by the magnetic field. Moreover, experiment has found\nthat well beyond the quantum limit, one or two valleys become totally empty.\nThis is the only case in condensed-matter physics where a Fermi sea is\ncompletely dried up by a magnetic field without a metal-insulator transition.\nThere have been two long-standing problems on bismuth near the quantum limit:\nthe large anisotropic Zeeman splitting of holes, and the extra peaks in quantum\noscillations, which cannot be assigned to any known Landau levels. These\nproblems are solved by taking into account the interband effect due to the\nspin-orbit couplings for the former, and the contributions from the twinned\ncrystal for the latter. Up to here, the whole spectrum can be interpreted\nwithin the one-particle theory. Finally, we will discuss transport and\nthermodynamic signatures of breaking of the valley symmetry in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 13:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The main limitations of this method comes from its\nnonrelativistic nature and its computational cost, the latter hampering the\ndirect evaluation of the inclusive cross sections as measured by experiments.\nWe extend the applicability of GFMC in the quasielastic region to intermediate\nmomentum transfers by performing the calculations in a reference frame that\nminimizes nucleon momenta. Additional relativistic effects in the kinematics\nare accounted for employing the two-fragment model. In addition, we developed a\nnovel algorithm, based on the concept of first-kind scaling, to compute the\ninclusive electromagnetic cross section of $^4$He through an accurate and\nreliable interpolation of the response functions. A very good agreement is\nobtained between theoretical and experimental cross sections for a variety of\nkinematical setups. This offers a promising prospect for the data analysis of\nneutrino-oscillation experiments that requires an accurate description of\nnuclear dynamics in which relativistic effects are fully accounted for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 14:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The spatial resolution of the IFS, the number of objects and the\nhomogeneity and coherence of the observations allow a complete characterization\nof the main observational properties and differences of the regions. Methods.\nWe analyzed a sample of 725 inner HII regions and a sample of 671 outer HII\nregions, all of them detected and extracted from the observations of a sample\nof 263 nearby, isolated, spiral galaxies observed by the CALIFA survey.\nResults.

The aim was to perform\na qualitative study about the relationship between the research behaviour of\nastronomers and how their science is being evaluated. This study encompassed\nthe funding and publication system as well as the indicators used to measure\nthe scientific output, its quality and the research performance. This report\nsheds light on how astronomers define high-quality research and how they think\nthat creating knowledge of value is encouraged or hampered by the evaluation\nprocesses. We found that astronomers are realists who define scientific quality\non the basis of \"truth\" and are driven by curiosity. These two factors make up\ntheir intrinsic values and motivation to perform Astronomy. Publication\npressure, arising from the requirements of \"the system\", creates an extrinsic\nmotivation to perform. This results in premature publications, low readability\nand replicability, risk aversion and a focus on quantity rather than quality.\nHence, indicators do not merely represent quality, but also co-constitute what\ncounts as good research. While we observe such constitutive effects of\nindicator use on research behaviour and content, we do not see that the\nastronomer's intrinsic values are co-constituted. This gives rise to a\ndiscrepancy between what is being measured by indicators and what astronomers\ndefine as scientific quality; the so-called \"evaluation gap\". Findings on\nconstitutive effects and the evaluation gap in Astronomy lays out the\nconceptual groundwork for further empirical research and for policy advice on\nalternative evaluation practices and innovative indicators with the aim of\nbridging the \"evaluation gap\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 13:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

In this study, we propose a novel\ntrajectory-based radical analysis network (TRAN) to firstly identify radicals\nand analyze two-dimensional structures among radicals simultaneously, then\nrecognize Chinese characters by generating captions of them based on the\nanalysis of their internal radicals. The proposed TRAN employs recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) as both an encoder and a decoder. The RNN encoder makes full\nuse of online information by directly transforming handwriting trajectory into\nhigh-level features. The RNN decoder aims at generating the caption by\ndetecting radicals and spatial structures through an attention model. The\nmanner of treating a Chinese character as a two-dimensional composition of\nradicals can reduce the size of vocabulary and enable TRAN to possess the\ncapability of recognizing unseen Chinese character classes, only if the\ncorresponding radicals have been seen. Evaluated on CASIA-OLHWDB database, the\nproposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nwhole-character modeling approach with a relative character error rate (CER)\nreduction of 10%. Meanwhile, for the case of recognition of 500 unseen Chinese\ncharacters, TRAN can achieve a character accuracy of about 60% while the\ntraditional whole-character method has no capability to handle them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

These interfaces have well defined\nspecific heats and compressibilities, hence energy can propagate along them\nanalogous to sound waves. Lipid monolayers prepared at the air-water interface\nof a Langmuir trough present an excellent model system to study such\npropagations. Here we propose that recent observations of two-dimensional shock\nwaves observed in lipid monolayers also provide the evidence for the detonation\nof shock waves at such interfaces, i.e. chemical energy stored in the interface\ncan be absorbed by a propagating shock front reinforcing it in the process. To\nthis end, we apply the classical theory in shock waves and detonation in the\ncontext of a lipid interface and its thermodynamic state. Based on these\ninsights it is claimed that the observed self-sustaining waves in lipid\nmonolayers represent a detonation like phenomena that utilizes the latent heat\nof phase transition of the lipids. However, the general nature of these\nequations allows that other possible sources of chemical energy can contribute\nto the propagating shock wave in a similar manner. Consequently, the\nunderstanding is applied to the nerve pulse propagation that is believed to\nrepresent a similar phenomenon, to obtain a qualitative understanding of the\npressure and temperature dependence of amplitude and threshold for action\npotentials.

Alternatively, satellite radar (InSAR) can be employed to observe\nvolcanic ground deformation, which has shown a significant statistical link to\neruptions. Modern satellites provide large coverage with high resolution\nsignals, leading to huge amounts of data. The explosion in data has brought\nmajor challenges associated with timely dissemination of information and\ndistinguishing volcano deformation patterns from noise, which currently relies\non manual inspection. Moreover, volcano observatories still lack expertise to\nexploit satellite datasets, particularly in developing countries. This paper\npresents a novel approach to detect volcanic ground deformation automatically\nfrom wrapped-phase InSAR images. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are\nemployed to detect unusual patterns within the radar data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 17:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}
