Researchers seeking to compensate for mmWave's high path loss\nand to achieve both gain and directivity have proposed that mmWave\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems make use of beamforming systems.\nHybrid beamforming in mmWave demonstrates promising performance in achieving\nhigh gain and directivity by using phase shifters at the analog processing\nblock. What remains a problem, however, is the actual implementation of mmWave\nbeamforming systems; to fabricate such a system is costly and complex. With the\naim of reducing such cost and complexity, this article presents actual\nprototypes of the lens antenna as an effective device to be used in the future\n5G mmWave hybrid beamforming systems. Using a lens as a passive phase shifter\nenables beamforming without the heavy network of active phase shifters, while\ngain and directivity are achieved by the energy-focusing property of the lens.\nProposed in this article are two types of lens antennas, one for static and the\nother for mobile usage. Their performance is evaluated using measurements and\nsimulation data along with link-level analysis via a software defined radio\n(SDR) platform. Results show the promising potential of the lens antenna for\nits high gain and directivity, and its improved beam-switching feasibility\ncompared to when a lens is not used. System-level evaluations reveal the\nsignificant throughput enhancement in both real indoor and outdoor\nenvironments. Moreover, the lens antenna's design issues are also discussed by\nevaluating different lens sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 16:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

Among many of the attacking methods, gradient-based methods are\nboth effective and easy to compute.

The main\ndifficulties for generating adversarial texts with gradient methods are i) the\ninput space is discrete, which makes it difficult to accumulate small noise\ndirectly in the inputs, and ii) the measurement of the quality of the\nadversarial texts is difficult. We tackle the first problem by searching for\nadversarials in the embedding space and then reconstruct the adversarial texts\nvia nearest neighbor search. For the latter problem, we employ the Word Mover's\nDistance (WMD) to quantify the quality of adversarial texts. Through extensive\nexperiments on three datasets, IMDB movie reviews, Reuters-2 and Reuters-5\nnewswires, we show that our framework can leverage gradient attacking methods\nto generate very high-quality adversarial texts that are only a few words\ndifferent from the original texts. There are many cases where we can change one\nword to alter the label of the whole piece of text. We successfully incorporate\nFGM and DeepFool into our framework.

Finally, the generic form of the axisymmetric\nmetric is expanded in the radial direction in terms of the continued fractions\nand the connection with other black-hole parametrizations is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 17:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 20:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 23:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

Here, we investigate the effect of the distribution of surface\nwater on the runaway greenhouse threshold for Earth-sized planets using a\nthree-dimensional dynamic atmosphere model. We considered a 1-bar atmosphere\nwhose composition is similar to the current Earth's atmosphere with a zonally\nuniform distribution of surface water.

We showed that each regime is controlled by the width of the\nHadley circulation, the amount of surface water, and the planetary topography.\nWe found that the runaway greenhouse threshold varies continuously with the\nsurface water distribution from about 130% (an aqua planet) to 180% (the\nextreme case of a land planet) of the present insolation at Earth's orbit. Our\nresults indicate that the inner edge of the habitable zone is not a single\nsharp boundary, but a border whose location varies depending on planetary\nsurface condition, such as the amount of surface water.

We show that the combined broadband lensing effect of the\nnano-ring and of the super-solid immersion lens significantly increases the\nextraction of light emitted by single InAs/GaAs quantum dots into free space:\nwe observe enhancements in the emitted intensity by the nano-ring of up to a\nfactor 20 and by the super-solid immersion lens of up to a factor 10. Such\ncumulative enhancements allow us to measure photon fluxes approaching 1 million\ncounts per second, from a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot in bulk. The combined\nbroad-band enhancement in the extraction of light can be implemented with any\nkind of classical and quantum solid-state emitter and opens the path to the\nrealisation of scalable bright devices. The same approach can also be\nimplemented to improve the absorption of light, for instance for small-area\nbroadband photo-detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 17:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

This phenomenon must be\nunderstood and mitigated in the next generation of liquid xenon (LXe)\nexperiments searching for WIMP dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay,\nand in the large liquid argon (LAr) detectors for the long-baseline neutrino\nprogrammes. We present a systematic study of this spurious emission involving a\nseries of slow voltage-ramping tests on fine metal wires immersed in a\ntwo-phase xenon time projection chamber with single electron sensitivity.\nEmission currents as low as $10^{-18}$ A can thus be detected by electron\ncounting, a vast improvement over previous dedicated measurements. Emission\nepisodes were recorded at surface fields as low as $\\sim$10 kV/cm in some wires\nand observed to have complex emission patterns, with average rates of 10-200\ncounts per second (c/s) and outbreaks as high as $\\sim$10$^6$ c/s. A fainter,\nless variable type of emission was also present in all untreated samples. There\nis evidence of a partial conditioning effect, with subsequent tests yielding on\naverage fewer emitters occurring at different fields for the same wire. We find\nno evidence for an intrinsic threshold particular to the metal-LXe interface\nwhich might have limited previous experiments up to fields of at least 160\nkV/cm. The general phenomenology is not consistent with enhanced field emission\nfrom microscopic filaments, but it appears instead to be related to the quality\nof the wire surface in terms of corrosion and the nature of its oxide layer.\nThis study concludes that some surface treatments, in particular nitric acid\ncleaning for stainless steel wires, can bringing about at least\norder-of-magnitude improvements in overall electron emission rates, and this\nshould help the next generation of detectors achieve the required electrostatic\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 18:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 10:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The core, long-standing problem that lineage\nsystems need to address---and the main focus of this paper---is to capture the\nrelationships between input and output data items across a workflow with the\ngoal to streamline queries over lineage. Unfortunately, current lineage systems\neither incur high lineage capture overheads, or lineage query processing costs,\nor both.

Two of the central Hamiltonian systems\nencountered in plasma physics --- the flow of magnetic field lines and the\nguiding center motion of magnetized charged particles --- resist symplectic\nintegration by conventional means because the dynamics are most naturally\nformulated in non-canonical coordinates, i.e., coordinates lacking the familiar\n$(q, p)$ partitioning. Recent efforts made progress toward non-canonical\nsymplectic integration of these systems by appealing to the variational\nintegration framework; however, those integrators were multistep methods and\nlater found to be numerically unstable due to parasitic mode instabilities.\nThis work eliminates the multistep character and, therefore, the parasitic mode\ninstabilities via an adaptation of the variational integration formalism that\nwe deem ``degenerate variational integration''. Both the magnetic field line\nand guiding center Lagrangians are degenerate in the sense that their resultant\nEuler-Lagrange equations are systems of first-order ODEs. We show that\nretaining the same degree of degeneracy when constructing a discrete Lagrangian\nyields one-step variational integrators preserving a non-canonical symplectic\nstructure on the original Hamiltonian phase space.

The goal is to\nstudy the kinematic and density structure of the SDC13 hub at high angular\nresolution to determine what drives its evolution and fragmentation. We have\nmapped SDC13, a 1000Msun infrared dark hub, in NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) emission\nlines, with both the JVLA and GBT down to 0.07pc. The mass-per-unit-lengths of\nall four hub filaments are thermally super-critical, consistent with the\npresence of tens of gravitationally bound cores along them. These cores exhibit\nregular separation of 0.37 +/- 0.16 pc suggesting gravitational instabilities\nrunning along these super-critical filaments are responsible for their\nfragmentation. The observed local increase of the dense gas velocity dispersion\ntowards starless cores is believed to be a consequence of such fragmentation\nprocess. We see velocity gradient peaks towards 63% of the cores as expected\nduring the early stages of filament fragmentation. The most massive cores are\nlocated at the filament junctions, where the velocity dispersion is the\nlargest. We interpret this as the result of the hub morphology generating the\nlargest acceleration gradients near the hub centre. We propose a scenario for\nthe evolution of the SDC13 hub in which filaments first form as post-shock\nstructures in a supersonic turbulent flow. Then gravity takes over and starts\nshaping the evolution of the hub, both fragmenting filaments and pulling the\ngas towards the centre of the gravitational well. By doing so, gravitational\nenergy is converted into kinetic energy in both local (cores) and global (hub\ncentre) potential well minima. Furthermore, the generation of larger\ngravitational acceleration gradients at the filament junctions promotes the\nformation of more massive cores.

NGC 7727 is relatively luminous ($M_V = -21.7$) and features two\nunequal tidal tails, various bluish arcs and star clusters, and two bright\nnuclei 480 pc apart in projection. These two nuclei have nearly identical\nredshifts, yet are strikingly different. The primary nucleus, hereafter\nNucleus_1, fits smoothly into the central luminosity profile of the galaxy and\nappears--at various wavelengths--\"red and dead.\" In contrast, Nucleus_2 is very\ncompact, has a tidal radius of 103 pc, and exhibits three signs of recent\nactivity: a post-starburst spectrum, an [O III]_5007 emission line, and a\ncentral X-ray point source. Its emission-line ratios place it among Seyfert\nnuclei. A comparison of Nucleus_2 ($M_V = -15.5$) with ultracompact dwarf\ngalaxies (UCDs) suggests that it may be the best case yet for a massive UCD\nhaving formed through tidal stripping of a gas-rich disk galaxy. Evidence for\nthis comes from its extended star-formation history, long blue tidal stream,\nand elevated dynamical-to-stellar-mass ratio. While the majority of its stars\nformed $\\gtrsim 10$ Gyr ago, about 1/3 by mass formed during starbursts in the\npast 2 Gyr.

Given a database S of n\nd-dimensional points and a d-dimensional query q, the k-nearest neighbors (kNN)\nclassifier assigns q with the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in S.\n  In the secure version of kNN, S and q are owned by two different parties that\ndo not want to share their data. Unfortunately, all known solutions for secure\nkNN either require a large communication complexity between the parties, or are\nvery inefficient to run.\n  In this work we present a classifier based on kNN, that can be implemented\nefficiently with homomorphic encryption (HE). The efficiency of our classifier\ncomes from a relaxation we make on kNN, where we allow it to consider kappa\nnearest neighbors for kappa ~ k with some probability. We therefore call our\nclassifier k-ish Nearest Neighbors (k-ish NN).\n  The success probability of our solution depends on the distribution of the\ndistances from q to S and increase as its statistical distance to Gaussian\ndecrease.\n  To implement our classifier we introduce the concept of double-blinded\ncoin-toss.

We use this coin-toss to efficiently\napproximate the average and variance of the distances from q to S.

For example, teachers may choose pairs of\nstudents who do not know each other to teach a new curriculum; regulators might\nallow or disallow merging of firms, and biologists may introduce or inhibit\ninteractions between genes or proteins. In this paper, we formalize this\nexperimental setting, and we refer to the individual treatments in such setting\nas entangled treatments. We then consider the special case where individual\ntreatments depend on a common population quantity, and develop theory and\nmethodology to deal with this case. In our target applications, the common\npopulation quantity is a network, and the individual treatments are defined as\nfunctions of the change in the network between two specific time points. Our\nfocus is on estimating the causal effect of entangled treatments in\nobservational studies where entangled treatments are endogenous and cannot be\ndirectly manipulated. When treatment cannot be manipulated, be it entangled or\nnot, it is necessary to account for the treatment assignment mechanism to avoid\nselection bias, commonly through a propensity score methodology. In this paper,\nwe quantify the extent to which classical propensity score methodology ignores\ntreatment entanglement, and characterize the bias in the estimated causal\neffects. To characterize such bias we introduce a novel similarity function\nbetween propensity score models, and a practical approximation of it, which we\nuse to quantify model misspecification of propensity scores due to\nentanglement. One solution to avoid the bias in the presence of entangled\ntreatments is to model the change in the network, directly, and calculate an\nindividual unit's propensity score by averaging treatment assignments over this\nchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 20:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

The hypothesis evaluated in this manuscript is\nwhether the choice of a communication model impacts the performance of a tasked\nartificial swarm. The biological models are used to design coordination\nalgorithms for a simulated swarm, which are evaluated over a range of six swarm\nrobotics tasks. Each task has an associated set of performance metrics that are\nused to evaluate how the communication models fare against each other. The\ngeneral findings demonstrate that the communication model significantly affects\nthe swarm's performance for individual tasks, and this result implies that the\ncommunication model-task pairing is an important consideration when designing\nartificial swarms.

The\nvorticity in the layer is accounted for by a conventional vortex sheet. The\nmass and momentum in the layer are represented by a two dimensional surface\nhaving its own internal tangential flow. Namely, the sheet has a mass density\nper-unit-area making it dynamically distinct from the surrounding outer fluid.\nThe mechanism of entrainment is represented by a discontinuity in the normal\ncomponent of velocity across the sheet. The sheet mass is able to support a\npressure jump, which in turn may cause additional entrainment. This feature was\nconfirmed when the model was used to represent the Falkner-Skan boundary\nlayers. The velocity field induced by the vortex-entrianment sheet is given by\na generalized Birkhoff-Rott equation with a complex sheet strength. The model\nwas also applied to the case of separation at a sharp edge. There is no\nrequirement for an explicit Kutta condition in the form of a singularity\nremoval as this condition is inherently satisfied through an appropriate\nbalance of normal momentum with the pressure jump across the sheet. A pressure\njump at the edge results in the generation of new vorticity. The shedding angle\nis dictated by the normal impulse of the intrinsic flow inside the bound sheets\nas they merge to form the free sheet. When there is zero entrainment everywhere\nthe model reduces to the conventional vortex sheet with no mass. Consequently,\nthe pressure jump must be zero and the shedding angle must be tangential so\nthat the sheet simply convects off the wedge face. Lastly, the\nvortex-entrainment sheet model was demonstrated on two shedding example\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 22:53:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 14:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

In such studies, after pre-processing, the data can be\nrepresented by a set of graphs, each representing a system's state at different\npoints in time. The analysis of the system's dynamics depends on the selection\nof the appropriate analytical tools. After characterizing similarities between\nstates, a critical step lies in the choice of a distance between graphs capable\nof reflecting such similarities. While the literature offers a number of\ndistances that one could a priori choose from, their properties have been\nlittle investigated and no guidelines regarding the choice of such a distance\nhave yet been provided. In particular, most graph distances consider that the\nnodes are exchangeable and do not take into account node identities. Accounting\nfor the alignment of the graphs enables us to enhance these distances'\nsensitivity to perturbations in the network and detect important changes in\ngraph dynamics. Thus the selection of an adequate metric is a decisive --yet\ndelicate--practical matter.\n  In the spirit of Goldenberg, Zheng and Fienberg's seminal 2009 review, the\npurpose of this article is to provide an overview of commonly-used graph\ndistances and an explicit characterization of the structural changes that they\nare best able to capture.

In addition, the physical mechanism behind the super and\nsub Alfvenic flows becoming unstable is quite different: the high frequency\nright circularly polarized whistler becomes unstable in the super Alfvenic\nflows whereas low frequency, left circularly polarized ion-cyclotron wave\nbecomes unstable in the presence of sub Alfvenic shear flows. The growth rate\nof the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the super Alfvenic case is higher than\nthe corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamic rate. In the sub Alfvenic case, the\nHall effect opens up a new, hitherto inaccessible (to the magnetohydrodynamics)\nchannel through which the partially or fully ionized fluid can become\nKelvin-Helmholtz unstable. The instability growth rate in this case is smaller\nthan the super Alfvenic case owing to the smaller free shear energy content of\nthe flow. When the Hall term is somewhat smaller than the advection term in the\ninduction equation, the Hall effect is also responsible for the appearance of a\nnew overstable mode whose growth rate is smaller than the purely growing Kelvin\nHelmholtz mode. On the other hand, when the Hall diffusion dominates the\nadvection term, the growth rate of the instability depends only on the Alfven\nMach number and is independent of the Hall diffusion coefficient. Further, the\ngrowth rate in this case linearly increase with the Alfven frequency with\nsmaller slope for sub Alfvenic flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 23:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Here multi-user pilot information, after being randomized\nindependently to avoid being spoofed, are converted into activation patterns of\nsubcarrier-block groups on code-frequency domain. Those patterns, though\noverlapped and interfered mutually in the wireless transmission environment,\nare qualified to be separated and identified as the original pilots with high\naccuracy, by exploiting CFBG coding theory and channel characteristic.\nParticularly, we develop the CFBG code through two steps, i.e., 1) devising an\nordered signal detection technique to recognize the number of signals\ncoexisting on each subcarrier block, and encoding each subcarrier block with\nthe detected number; 2) constructing a zero-false-drop (ZFD) code and block\ndetection based (BD) code via k-dimensional Latin hypercubes and integrating\nthose two codes into the CFBG code. This code can bring a desirable pilot\nseparation error probability (SEP), inversely proportional to the number of\noccupied subcarriers and antennas with a power of k. To apply the code to PA, a\nscheme of pilot conveying, separation and identification is proposed. Based on\nthis novel PA, a joint channel estimation and identification mechanism is\nproposed to achieve high-precision channel recovery and simultaneously enhance\nPA without occupying extra resources.

Multi-wavelength images\nreveal a semi-ring-like feature (associated with ionized gas emission) and an\nembedded face-on ring-like feature (without the NVSS 1.4 GHz radio emission;\nwhere 1-sigma ~ 0.45 mJy/beam) in the MCG35.6. The semi-ring-like feature is\noriginated by the ionizing feedback from a star with spectral type B0.5V-B0V.\nThe central region of the ring-like feature does not contain detectable ionized\ngas emission, indicating that the ring-like feature is unlikely to be produced\nby the ionizing feedback from a massive star. Several embedded Herschel clumps\nand young stellar objects (YSOs) are identified in the MCG35.6, tracing the\nongoing SF activities within the cloud. The polarization information from the\nPlanck and GPIPS data trace the plane-of-sky magnetic field, which is oriented\nparallel to the major axis of the ring-like feature. At least five clumps\n(having M_clump ~ 740 - 1420 M_sun) seem to be distributed in an almost\nregularly spaced manner along the ring-like feature and contain noticeable\nYSOs. Based on the analysis of the polarization and molecular line data, three\nsubregions containing the clumps are found to be magnetically supercritical in\nthe ring-like feature. Altogether, the existence of the ring-like feature and\nthe SF activities on its edges can be explained by the magnetic field mediated\nprocess as simulated by Li & Nakamura (2002).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 01:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in\natomic form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the\nother carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen\nabundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both\nthe CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing\nnon-degenerate constraints on both C and O.

Using these similarities, the attacker's goal is\nto infer as much information as possible about the underlying network,\nincluding any remaining unknown pairwise node similarities and edges.\n  For the effective resistance metric, we show that with just a small subset of\nmeasurements, the attacker can learn a large fraction of edges in a social\nnetwork, even when the measurements are noisy. We also show that it is possible\nto learn a graph which accurately matches the underlying network on all other\neffective resistances. This second observation is interesting from a data\nmining perspective, since it can be expensive to accurately compute all\neffective resistances.

In addition, we elucidate that\nneither Meissner effect nor vortex state due to chiral magnetic fields occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 05:59:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 07:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

For each of the HII regions, spectra are\nextracted at different nebular radii along the slit-coverage.

Radial profiles of these diversely\nestimated abundances are drawn for each nebula.

Our dataset, named\nDHF1K (Dynamic Human Fixation), consists of 1K high-quality, elaborately\nselected video sequences spanning a large range of scenes, motions, object\ntypes and background complexity. Existing video saliency datasets lack variety\nand generality of common dynamic scenes and fall short in covering challenging\nsituations in unconstrained environments. In contrast, DHF1K makes a\nsignificant leap in terms of scalability, diversity and difficulty, and is\nexpected to boost video saliency modeling. Second, we propose a novel video\nsaliency model that augments the CNN-LSTM network architecture with an\nattention mechanism to enable fast, end-to-end saliency learning. The attention\nmechanism explicitly encodes static saliency information, thus allowing LSTM to\nfocus on learning more flexible temporal saliency representation across\nsuccessive frames. Such a design fully leverages existing large-scale static\nfixation datasets, avoids overfitting, and significantly improves training\nefficiency and testing performance. We thoroughly examine the performance of\nour model, with respect to state-of-the-art saliency models, on three\nlarge-scale datasets (i.e., DHF1K, Hollywood2, UCF sports).

Since the number\ndensities of the ortho- and para-H$_{2}$$^{18}$O molecules are about 560 times\nsmaller than their $^{16}$O analogues, they trace deeper into the disk than the\northo-H$_{2}$$^{16}$O lines (down to $z=0$, i.e., the midplane).

Thus in the sub-millimeter candidate\nwater line cases, the local intensity from the outer optically thin region in\nthe disk is around $10^{4}$ times smaller than that in the infrared candidate\nwater line cases.

Delay-and-Sum (DAS) is the most common beamforming\nalgorithm in PAI. However, using DAS beamformer leads to low resolution images\nand considerable contribution of off-axis signals. A new paradigm namely\nDelay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS), which was originally used as a reconstruction\nalgorithm in confocal microwave imaging, was introduced to overcome the\nchallenges in DAS. DMAS was used in PAI systems and it was shown that this\nalgorithm results in resolution improvement and sidelobe degrading. However,\nDMAS is still sensitive to high levels of noise, and resolution improvement is\nnot satisfying. Here, we propose a novel algorithm based on DAS algebra inside\nDMAS formula expansion, Double Stage DMAS (DS-DMAS), which improves the image\nresolution and levels of sidelobe, and is much less sensitive to high level of\nnoise compared to DMAS. The performance of DS-DMAS algorithm is evaluated\nnumerically and experimentally. The resulted images are evaluated qualitatively\nand quantitatively using established quality metrics including signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) and contrast ratio (CR). It is\nshown that DS-DMAS outperforms DAS and DMAS at the expense of higher\ncomputational load. DS-DMAS reduces the lateral valley for about 15 dB and\nimproves the SNR and FWHM better than 13% and 30%, respectively. Moreover, the\nlevels of sidelobe are reduced for about 10 dB in comparison with those in\nDMAS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 09:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

We present an upgraded version, covering ensemble modelling\nto produce a distribution of possible ICME arrival times and speeds, the\ndrag-based ensemble model (DBEM). Multiple runs using uncertainty ranges for\nthe input values can be performed in almost real-time, within a few minutes.\nThis allows us to define the most likely ICME arrival times and speeds,\nquantify prediction uncertainties and determine forecast confidence.

We\ninvestigate the feasibility of deanonymizing users of Tor hidden services who\nrely on Bitcoin as a payment method by exploiting public information leaked\nfrom online social networks, the Blockchain, and onion websites.

Yet urban scaling research is largely disconnected from\nintra-urban structure. In contrast, the monocentric model of Alonso provides a\nresidential choice-based theory to urban density profiles. However, it is\nsilent about how these profiles scale with population, thus preventing\nempirical scaling studies to anchor in a strong micro-economic theory. This\npaper bridges this gap by introducing power laws for land, income and transport\ncost in the Alonso model. From this augmented model, we derive the conditions\nat which the equilibrium urban structure matches recent empirical findings\nabout the scaling of urban land and population density profiles in European\ncities. We find that the Alonso model is theoretically compatible with the\nobserved scaling of population density profiles and satisfactorily represents\nEuropean cities. This compatibility however challenges current empirical\nunderstanding of wage and transport cost elasticities with population, and\nrequires a scaling of the housing land profile that is different from the\nobserved.

In this paper we analyse\nwhether sophisticated learning mechanisms are always necessary for HHs to\nperform well. To this end we consider the most simple HHs from the literature\nand rigorously analyse their performance for the LeadingOnes function. Our\nanalysis shows that the standard Simple Random, Permutation, Greedy and Random\nGradient HHs show no signs of learning. While the former HHs do not attempt to\nlearn from the past performance of low-level heuristics, the idea behind the\nRandom Gradient HH is to continue to exploit the currently selected heuristic\nas long as it is successful. Hence, it is embedded with a reinforcement\nlearning mechanism with the shortest possible memory.

The key\nobservation is that during handshaking, although belonged to two different\nusers, the two hands involved in the shaking events are often rigidly\nconnected, and therefore exhibit very similar motion patterns. We propose a\nnovel Shake-n-Shack system, which harvests motion data during user handshaking\nfrom the wrist worn smart devices such as smartwatches or fitness bands, and\nexploits the matching motion patterns to generate symmetric keys on both\nparties.

To reduce the number of RF\nchains while still maintaining the spatial multiplexing gain of large-array,\nhybrid precoding architecture has been proposed for mmWave systems and received\nconsiderable interest in both industry and academia.

The efficiency\nof such a conventional detection scheme can potentially be enhanced by the\nmethod of quantum illumination, where entanglement is exploited to break the\nclassical limits. The question is, what is the optimal quantum state that\nallows us to achieve the detection limit with a minimal error? Here we address\nthis question for discrete signals, by deriving a complete and general set of\nanalytic solutions for the whole parameter space, which can be classified into\nthree distinct regions, in the form of phase diagrams for both conventional and\nquantum illumination. Interestingly, whenever the reflectivity of the target is\nless than some critical values, all received signals become useless, which is\ntrue even if entangled resources are employed. However, there does exist a\nregion where quantum illumination can provide advantages over conventional\nillumination; there, the optimal signal state is an entangled state with an\nentanglement spectrum inversely proportional to the spectrum of the\nenvironmental state. These results not only impose fundamental limits in\napplications such as quantum radars, but also suggest how to become immune\nagainst the attack of minimally-invasive detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 14:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

The PSF smears the image of any recorded object and\ntherefore needs to be taken into account when inferring properties of galaxies\nfrom astronomical images. In the case of cosmic shear, the PSF is one of the\ndominant sources of systematic errors and must be treated carefully to avoid\nbiases in cosmological parameters. Recently, forward modeling approaches to\ncalibrate shear measurements within the Monte-Carlo Control Loops ($MCCL$)\nframework have been developed. These methods typically require simulating a\nlarge amount of wide-field images, thus, the simulations need to be very fast\nyet have realistic properties in key features such as the PSF pattern. Hence,\nsuch forward modeling approaches require a very flexible PSF model, which is\nquick to evaluate and whose parameters can be estimated reliably from survey\ndata. We present a PSF model that meets these requirements based on a fast\ndeep-learning method to estimate its free parameters. We demonstrate our\napproach on publicly available SDSS data. We extract the most important\nfeatures of the SDSS sample via principal component analysis. Next, we\nconstruct our model based on perturbations of a fixed base profile, ensuring\nthat it captures these features. We then train a Convolutional Neural Network\nto estimate the free parameters of the model from noisy images of the PSF. This\nallows us to render a model image of each star, which we compare to the SDSS\nstars to evaluate the performance of our method. We find that our approach is\nable to accurately reproduce the SDSS PSF at the pixel level, which, due to the\nspeed of both the model evaluation and the parameter estimation, offers good\nprospects for incorporating our method into the $MCCL$ framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 15:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 07:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

A similar process may occur in a single atomic nucleus undergoing a\nviolent perturbation, like in heavy-ion collisions tracked in particle\naccelerators at around 30 to 50 MeV per nucleon: in this conditions, after the\ninitial collision shock, the nucleus expands and then clusterises into several\nsmaller nuclear fragments.\n  Microscopically, when violent perturbation are applied to nuclear matter, a\nprocess of clusterisation arises from the combination of several fluctuation\nmodes of large-amplitude where neutrons and protons may oscillate in phase or\nout of phase. The imposed perturbation leads to conditions of instability, the\nwavelengths which are the most amplified have sizes comparable to small atomic\nnuclei. We found that these conditions, explored in heavy-ion collisions,\ncorrespond to the splitting of a nucleus into fragments ranging from Oxygen to\nNeon in a time interval shorter than one zeptosecond (10$^{-21}$s). From the\nout-of-phase oscillations of neutrons and protons another property arises, the\nsmaller fragments belonging to a more volatile phase get more neutron enriched:\nin the heavy-ion collision case this process, called distillation, reflects in\nthe isotopic distributions of the fragments.\n  The resulting dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions is an improvement\nwith respect to more usual statistical approaches, based on the equilibrium\nassumption. It allows in fact to characterise also the very fast early stages\nof the collision process which are out of equilibrium. Such dynamical\ndescription is the core of the Boltzmann-Langevin One Body (BLOB) model, which\nunifies in a common description fluctuations in nuclear matter and the\ndisintegration of nuclei into nuclear fragments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 15:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

In the present\nwork, graphene-phosphorene vdW-heterostructures are investigated with the\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT). The challenge of treating nearly\nincommensurate (very large) supercell in DFT is bypassed by considering\ndifferent energetic quantities in the grand canonical ensemble, alternative to\nthe formation energy, in order to take into account the mismatch elastic\ncontribution of the different layers. In the investigated heterostructures, it\nis found that phosphorene contracts by ~4% in the armchair direction when\ncompared to its free-standing form. This large contraction leads to important\nchanges in term of electronic properties, with the direct electronic optical\ntransition of phosphorene becoming indirect in specific vdW-heterostructures.\nMore generally, such a contraction indicates strong substrate effects in\nsupported or encapsulated phosphorene -neglected hitherto- and paves the way to\nsubstrate-controlled stress- tronic in such 2D crystal. In addition, the\nstability of these vdW-heterostructures are investigated as a function of the\nrotation angle between the layers and as a function of the stacking\ncomposition. The alignment of the specific crystalline directions of graphene\nand phosphorene is found energetically favored.

PSR J0437$-$4715 is the nearest\nmillisecond pulsar and the brightest at radio. To explore the feasibility of\nachieving a parallax distance accuracy of one light-year, comparable to the\nrecent timing result, with the technique of differential astrometry, we\nsearched for compact radio sources quite close to PSR J0437$-$4715.

We continuously test the devices in-situ and\nin-operando with current-voltage sweeps, transient photocurrent, and transient\nphotovoltage measurements, and find that degradation in the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx\nsolar cells due to oxygen exposure occurs over shorter timescales than\nFA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 mixed-cation devices. We attribute these\noxygen-induced losses in the power conversion efficiencies to the formation of\nelectron traps within the perovskite photoactive layer. Our results highlight\nthat the formamidinium-caesium mixed-cation perovskites are much less sensitive\nto oxygen-induced degradation than the methylammonium-based perovskite cells,\nand that further improvements in perovskite solar cell stability should focus\non the mitigation of trap generation during ageing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 21:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

It is of\ngreat importance for diagnoses and treatments in clinical medicine. Herbal\nprescriptions are simple, noninvasive and have low side effects. Thus, they are\nwidely applied in China. Studies on the automatic construction technology of\nherbal prescriptions based on tongue images have great significance for deep\nlearning to explore the relevance of tongue images for herbal prescriptions, it\ncan be applied to healthcare services in mobile medical systems. In order to\nadapt to the tongue image in a variety of photographic environments and\nconstruct herbal prescriptions, a neural network framework for prescription\nconstruction is designed. It includes single/double convolution channels and\nfully connected layers. Furthermore, it proposes the auxiliary therapy topic\nloss mechanism to model the therapy of Chinese doctors and alleviate the\ninterference of sparse output labels on the diversity of results. The\nexperiment use the real world tongue images and the corresponding prescriptions\nand the results can generate prescriptions that are close to the real samples,\nwhich verifies the feasibility of the proposed method for the automatic\nconstruction of herbal prescriptions from tongue images. Also, it provides a\nreference for automatic herbal prescription construction from more physical\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 08:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 05:43:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 08:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 09:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

As the thesis was written with motivation from the context of the\nbiodiversity workgroup at the City University of Applied Sciences Bremen, the\nclassification of taxonomic entries was chosen as an exemplary use case. In\norder to automate the dataset creation, a prototype was conceptualized and\nimplemented after working out knowledge basics and analyzing requirements for\nit. It makes use of an pre-trained abstract artificial intelligence which is\nable to sort out images that do not contain the desired content. Subsequent to\nthe implementation and the automated dataset creation resulting from it, an\nevaluation was performed. Other, manually collected datasets were compared to\nthe one the prototype produced in means of specifications and accuracy. The\nresults were more than satisfactory and showed that automatically generating a\ndataset for image recognition is not only possible, but also might be a decent\nalternative to spending time and money in doing this task manually. At the very\nend of this work, an idea of how to use the principle of employing abstract\nartificial intelligences for step-by-step classification of deeper taxonomic\nlayers in a productive system is presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 19:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}
