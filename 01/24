Multiphoton\nexcitation fluorescence analyses as well as non-linear optical techniques offer\nunique possibilities to investigate the effects of the local environment on the\nexcited states of fluorophores. Herein these techniques are applied for the\nfirst time to the study of insects' natural fluorescence. The case of the male\nHoplia coerulea beetle is investigated because the scales covering the beetle's\nelytra are known to possess an internal photonic structure with embedded\nfluorophores, which controls both the beetle's colouration and the fluorescence\nemission. An intense two-photon excitation fluorescence signal is observed, the\nintensity of which changes upon contact with water. A Third-Harmonic Generation\nsignal is also detected, the intensity of which depends on the light\npolarisation state. The analysis of these non-linear optical and fluorescent\nresponses unveils the multi-excited states character of the fluorophore\nmolecules embedded in the beetle's elytra. The anisotropy of the photonic\nstructure, which causes additional tailoring of the beetle's optical responses,\nis confirmed by circularly polarised light and non-linear optical measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 16:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

Previous work to enhance the sensitivity of microarray readout to\nthe single-molecule ('digital') regime have either required signal amplifying\nchemistry or sacrificed throughput, nixing the platform's primary advantages.\nHere, we report the development of a digital microarray which extends both the\nsensitivity and dynamic range of microarrays by about three orders of\nmagnitude. This technique uses functionalized gold nanorods as single-molecule\nlabels and an interferometric scanner which can rapidly enumerate individual\nnanorods by imaging them with a 10x objective lens. This approach does not\nrequire any chemical enhancement such as silver deposition, and scans arrays\nwith a throughput similar to commercial fluorescence devices. By combining\nsingle-nanoparticle enumeration and ensemble measurements of spots when the\nparticles are very dense, this system achieves a dynamic range of about one\nmillion directly from a single scan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 16:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

An adversary\nchooses the initial nodes of the agents and assigns a different label to each\nof them. The agents move in synchronous rounds and communicate with each other\nonly when located at the same node. Within the team, f of the agents are\nByzantine. A Byzantine agent acts in an unpredictable way: in particular it may\nforge the label of another agent or create a completely new one. Besides its\nlabel, which corresponds to a local knowledge, an agent is assigned some global\nknowledge GK that is common to all agents. In literature, the Byzantine\ngathering problem has been analyzed in arbitrary n-node graphs by considering\nthe scenario when GK=(n,f) and the scenario when GK=f. In the first (resp.\nsecond) scenario, it has been shown that the minimum number of good agents\nguaranteeing deterministic gathering of all of them is f+1 (resp. f+2). For\nboth these scenarios, all the existing deterministic algorithms, whether or not\nthey are optimal in terms of required number of good agents, have a time\ncomplexity that is exponential in n and L, where L is the largest label\nbelonging to a good agent.\n  In this paper, we seek to design a deterministic solution for Byzantine\ngathering that makes a concession on the proportion of Byzantine agents within\nthe team, but that offers a significantly lower complexity. We also seek to use\na global knowledge whose the length of the binary representation is small.\nAssuming that the agents are in a strong team i.e., a team in which the number\nof good agents is at least some prescribed value that is quadratic in f, we\ngive positive and negative results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 16:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

This process enhances the transfer of energy into\nsmaller scales, and has been connected with heating of coronal loops, when\ndissipation mechanisms, such as resistivity, are considered. However, the\nturbulent layer is expected near the outer regions of the loops. Therefore, the\neffects of wave heating are expected to be confined to the loop's external\nlayers, leaving their denser inner parts without a heating mechanism. In the\ncurrent work we aim to study the spatial evolution of wave heating effects from\na footpoint driven standing kink wave in a coronal loop. Using the MPI-AMRVAC\ncode, we performed ideal, three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nfootpoint driven transverse oscillations of a cold, straight coronal flux tube,\nembedded in a hotter environment. We have also constructed forward models for\nour simulation using the FoMo code. The developed Transverse Wave Induced\nKelvin-Helmholtz (TWIKH) rolls expand throughout the tube cross-section, and\ncover it entirely. This turbulence significantly alters the initial density\nprofile, leading to a fully deformed cross section. As a consequence, the\nresistive and viscous heating rate both increase over the entire loop cross\nsection. The resistive heating rate takes its maximum values near the\nfootpoints, while the viscous heating rate at the apex. We conclude that even a\nmonoperiodic driver can spread wave heating over the whole loop cross section,\npotentially providing a heating source in the inner loop region. Despite the\nloop's fully deformed structure, forward modelling still shows the structure\nappearing as a loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 16:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

This process is\noften assumed to be governed by the dipolar component of the magnetic field.\nHowever, observed magnetic fields can host strong quadrupolar and/or octupolar\ncomponents, which may influence the resulting spin-down torque on the star. In\nPaper I, we used the MHD code PLUTO to compute steady state solutions for\nstellar winds containing a mixture of dipole and quadrupole geometries. We\nshowed the combined winds to be more complex than a simple sum of winds with\nthese individual components. This work follows the same method as Paper I,\nincluding the octupole geometry which increases the field complexity but also,\nmore fundamentally, looks for the first time at combining the same symmetry\nfamily of fields, with the field polarity of the dipole and octupole geometries\nreversing over the equator (unlike the symmetric quadrupole). We show, as in\nPaper I, that the lowest order component typically dominates the spin down\ntorque. Specifically, the dipole component is the most significant in governing\nthe spin down torque for mixed geometries and under most conditions for real\nstars. We present a general torque formulation that includes the effects of\ncomplex, mixed fields, which predicts the torque for all the simulations to\nwithin 20% precision, and the majority to within ~5%.

The oxyl complex\neither reacts with the substrate or is further protonated to a hydroxyl\ncomplex. Both the oxyl and hydroxyl complexes are also readily generated from a\nreaction with H2O2.

Studies using\npopulation synthesis models have incorporated this by assuming a broad,\nuniversal (i.e. does not depend on the host galaxy properties) probability\ndistribution for AGN specific X-ray luminosities (i.e. the ratio of $L_X$ to\nhost stellar mass; a common proxy for Eddington ratio).

To investigate this further we develop a population synthesis\nmodel in which the Eddington ratio distribution is different for star-forming\nand quiescent host galaxies. We show that, although this model is able to\nreproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions out to z$\\sim$2, it fails to\nsimultaneously reproduce the observed flat relationship between SFR and X-ray\nluminosity.

Star-disc interactions\ntruncate discs and produce multiple systems. Discs may be destroyed in\ndynamical encounters and/or through ram-pressure stripping, but reform by later\ngas accretion. We quantify the distributions of disc mass and radii for\nprotostellar ages up to $\\approx 10^5$ yrs. For low-mass protostars, disc\nmasses tend to increase with both age and protostellar mass. Disc radii range\nfrom of order ten to a few hundred au, grow in size on timescales $\\le 10^4$\nyr, and are smaller around lower-mass protostars. The radial surface density\nprofiles of isolated protostellar discs are flatter than the minimum mass solar\nnebula model, typically scaling as $\\Sigma \\propto r^{-1}$. Disc to protostar\nmass ratios rarely exceed two, with a typical range of $M_{\\rm d}/M_* = 0.1-1$\nto ages $\\le 10^4$ yrs and decreasing thereafter. We quantify the relative\norientation angles of circumstellar discs and the orbit of bound pairs of\nprotostars, finding a preference for alignment that strengths with decreasing\nseparation. We also investigate how the orientations of the outer parts of\ndiscs differ from the protostellar and inner disc spins for isolated protostars\nand pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

The observations are part of the ongoing near-infrared VISTA survey of\nthe Magellanic Cloud system (VMC). The data analyzed here corresponds to one\nVMC tile and covers a total sky area of 1.77 deg^2. Absolute proper motions\nwith respect to ~9070 background galaxies are calculated from a linear\nregression model applied to the stellar positions in 11 epochs in the Ks\nfilter. The data extend over a total time baseline of ~17 months. We found a\nmedian proper motion of the stars within 47 Tuc of (mu_a cos(d), mu_d) = (+5.89\n+/- 0.02(stat) +/- 0.13(sys), -2.14 +/- 0.02(stat) +/- 0.08(sys)) mas/yr, based\non the measurements of ~35000 individual sources between 5' and 42' from the\ncluster center. We compared our result to the proper motions from the newest US\nNaval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC5) which includes data from the\nGaia data release 1. Selecting cluster members (~2700 stars) we found a median\nproper motion of (mu_a cos(d), mu_d) = (+5.30 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.70(sys),\n-2.70 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.70(sys)) mas/yr. The values derived from the VMC\ndata are consistent with the UCAC5 result, and are close to literature\nmeasurements obtained using HST. We combined our results with literature radial\nvelocity measurements and reconstructed the orbit of 47 Tuc, finding that the\ncluster is on a low-ellipticity orbit and is confined within the inner ~7.5 kpc\nof the Galaxy. We show that the use of an increased time baseline combined with\nPSF-determined stellar centroids in crowded regions significantly improves the\naccuracy of the method. In future works, we will apply this method to more VMC\ntiles to study in detail the kinematics of the Magellanic Clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 19:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

We verify this fact by\ndiscovering and applying two new practical and important attacks: battery-drain\nand Denial-of-Body-control (DoB). The former can drain the vehicle battery\nwhile the latter can prevent the owner from starting or even opening/entering\nhis car, when either or both attacks are mounted with the ignition off. We\nfirst analyze how operation (e.g., normal, sleep, listen) modes of ECUs are\ndefined in various in-vehicle network standards and how they are implemented in\nthe real world. From this analysis, we discover that an adversary can exploit\nthe wakeup function of in-vehicle networks---which was originally designed for\nenhanced user experience/convenience (e.g., remote diagnosis, remote\ntemperature control)---as an attack vector. Ironically, a core battery-saving\nfeature in in-vehicle networks makes it easier for an attacker to wake up ECUs\nand, therefore, mount and succeed in battery-drain and/or DoB attacks. Via\nextensive experimental evaluations on various real vehicles, we show that by\nmounting the battery-drain attack, the adversary can increase the average\nbattery consumption by at least 12.57x, drain the car battery within a few\nhours or days, and therefore immobilize/cripple the vehicle. We also\ndemonstrate the proposed DoB attack on a real vehicle, showing that the\nattacker can cut off communications between the vehicle and the driver's key\nfob by indefinitely shutting down an ECU, thus making the driver unable to\nstart and/or even enter the car.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 19:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

In practice, current ORM methods are constrained to the generation\nof data analytics reports, which aggregate statistics of popularity and\nsentiment on social media. We argue that this format is too restrictive as end\nusers often like to have the flexibility to search for entity-centric\ninformation that is not available in predefined charts. As such, we propose the\ninclusion of entity retrieval capabilities as a first step towards the\nextension of current ORM capabilities. However, an entity's reputation is also\ninfluenced by the entity's relationships with other entities. Therefore, we\naddress the problem of Entity-Relationship (E-R) retrieval in which the goal is\nto search for multiple connected entities. This is a challenging problem which\ntraditional entity search systems cannot cope with. Besides E-R retrieval we\nalso believe ORM would benefit of text-based entity-centric prediction\ncapabilities, such as predicting entity popularity on social media based on\nnews events or the outcome of political surveys. However, none of these tasks\ncan provide useful results if there is no effective entity disambiguation and\nsentiment analysis tailored to the context of ORM.

However, muon image reconstruction\ntechniques are limited in resolution due to low muon flux and the effects of\nmultiple Coulomb scattering (MCS). Current reconstruction algorithms rely on\noverly simple assumptions for muon path estimation through the imaged object.\nFor robust muon tomography, efficient and flexible physics based algorithms are\nneeded to model the MCS process and accurately estimate the most probable\ntrajectory of a muon as it traverses an object. In the present work, the use of\na Bayesian framework and a Gaussian approximation of MCS are explored for\nestimation of the most likely path of a cosmic ray muon traversing uniform or\nnonuniform media and undergoing MCS. The algorithm's precision is compared to\nMonte Carlo simulated muon trajectories. It was found that the algorithm is\nexpected to be able to predict muon tracks to less than 1.5 mm RMS for 0.5 GeV\nmuons and 0.25 mm RMS for 3 GeV muons, a 50 percent improvement compared to SLP\nand 15 percent improvement when compared to PoCA.

The extraction of these eigenfunctions and their associated\neigenfrequencies from a given time series is a non-trivial problem when the\nunderlying system has a dense point spectrum, or a continuous spectrum behaving\nsimilarly to noise. This paper describes methods for identifying Koopman\neigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions from a discretely sampled time series\ngenerated by such a system with unknown dynamics.

Finding evidence for life on rocky planets outside of our\nsolar system requires new technical capabilities for the key measurements of\nspectral signatures of biosignature gases, and of planetary mass measurement.\nSpectra of Earth-like planets can be directly measured in reflected stellar\nlight in the visible band or near-infrared using a factor 1e-10 starlight\nsuppression with occulters, either internal (coronagraph) or external\n(starshade). Absorption and emission (reflected and thermal) spectra can be\nobtained in the mid-infrared of rocky planets transiting M-dwarfs via\nspectroscopy of the transit and secondary eclipse, respectively. Mass can be\nmeasured from the star's reflex motion, the reflex motion of a star, via either\nprecision radial velocity methods or astrometry. Several technology gaps must\nbe closed to provide astronomers the necessary capabilities to obtain these key\nmeasurements for small planets orbiting within the predicted temperate zones\naround nearby stars. These involved performance improvements, in some cases,\n1-2 orders of magnitude from state-of-the-art or involve performances never\ndemonstrated.

Simulations\nperformed thus far follow flavor evolution along a single neutrino trajectory,\nbut self-consistency requires all trajectories to be treated simultaneously,\nand it has not been known whether MNR phenomena would still occur in\nmulti-angle models. In this paper, we present the first fully multi-angle\ncalculations of MNR. We find that familiar MNR phenomena, where neutrinos\ntransform to a greater extent than anti-neutrinos and a feedback mechanism\nmaintains the cancellation between the matter and neutrino potential, still\noccurs for a subset of angular bins, although the flavor transformation is not\nas efficient as in the single-angle case.

These\nflavor transformation phenomena appear to be robust and are present for a wide\nrange of model parameters, as long as an MNR is present.

For the 273 events where the CME was predicted to\narrive at Earth, STEREO-A, or STEREO-B, and was actually observed (hit event),\nthe mean absolute arrival-time prediction error was 10.4 +/- 0.9 hours, with a\ntendency to early prediction error of -4.0 hours.

As information technology\ngrows rapidly, observations are seldom independent from others so a space\nautoregressive models can take this dependence into account and draw more\nreliable conclusions between covariates and the target variable itself. Based\non the classical spatial model, Su and Jin proposed a semi-parametric model\nnamed as partially specified spatial autoregressive model (PSAR) to allow for\nmore flexibility in modeling. And to estimate this nonparametric component, we\nuse the neural network model which adds more flexibility to the classical model\nand allows for variations in the choice of activation functions according to\ndifferent types of data. This paper extends an artificial neural network model\nto a partially specified space autoregressive model and proposes maximum\nlikelihood estimators instead of quasi-maximum likelihood estimates. We\nestablish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators in this\nmodel. These results are obtained under some standard conditions in spatial\nmodels as well as neural network models. To illustrate, we investigate the\nquality of the normal approximation for finite samples by means of numerical\nsimulation studies with three common choices of error distributions (standard\nnormal, student-t distribution and the Laplace distribution). We apply our\nproposed model to a soil-water tension problem and a criminal study in Chicago.\nThe results showed that our model can capture the spatial dependence between\nunits as well as the unknown correlation structure between the target variable\nand covariates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 00:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 15:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

We show that the\nsame modification of the spatial structure exists for relativistic electrons as\nwell as for focused gravitational waves.

In gravitational waves described with linearized general relativity,\nthe curvature of space-time between the transverse and propagation direction\nleads to the modification of the spatial structure.

Among known approaches, server-aided revocation\nyields a promising solution, because it allows to outsource the major workloads\nof system users to a computationally powerful third party, called the server,\nwhose only requirement is to carry out the computations correctly. Such a\nrevocation mechanism was considered in the settings of identity-based\nencryption and attribute-based encryption by Qin et al. (ESORICS 2015) and Cui\net al.

The latter, introduced by Katz,\nSahai, and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2008), provides fine-grained and role-based access\nto encrypted data and can be viewed as a generalization of identity-based and\nattribute-based encryption. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we formalize\nthe model of server-aided revocable predicate encryption (SR-PE), with rigorous\ndefinitions and security notions. Our model can be seen as a non-trivial\nadaptation of Cui et al.'s work into the PE context. Second, we put forward a\nlattice-based instantiation of SR-PE.

Constructing\npredictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated\npredictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that\ndiscards the vast majority of information in each patient's record. We propose\na representation of patients' entire, raw EHR records based on the Fast\nHealthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep\nlearning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting\nmultiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data\nharmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two\nU.S. academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at\nleast 24 hours. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data\nunrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes.\nDeep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting\nin-hospital mortality (AUROC across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned\nreadmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and\nall of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90).\nThese models outperformed state-of-the-art traditional predictive models in all\ncases. We also present a case-study of a neural-network attribution system,\nwhich illustrates how clinicians can gain some transparency into the\npredictions. We believe that this approach can be used to create accurate and\nscalable predictions for a variety of clinical scenarios, complete with\nexplanations that directly highlight evidence in the patient's chart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 05:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 18:57:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 12:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

The two kinds of\ninformation play different roles in determining the sentiment label of a\nreview. Therefore, it is not reasonable to encode user and product information\ntogether into one representation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nto encode user and product information.

The dual problem, where the parity check matrix has a support\nconstraint, comes up in the design of locally repairable codes. The central\nproblem here is to design codes with the largest possible minimum distance,\nsubject to the given support constraint on the generator matrix. An upper bound\non the minimum distance can be obtained through a set of singleton bounds,\nwhich can be alternatively thought of as a cut-set bound. Furthermore, it is\nwell known that, if the field size is large enough, any random generator matrix\nobeying the support constraint will achieve the maximum minimum distance with\nhigh probability. Since random codes are not easy to decode, structured codes\nwith efficient decoders, e.g., Reed-Solomon codes, are much more desirable. The\nGM-MDS conjecture of Dau et al states that the maximum minimum distance over\nall codes satisfying the generator matrix support constraint can be obtained by\na Reed Solomon code. If true, this would have significant consequences. The\nconjecture has been proven for several special case: when the dimension of the\ncode k is less than or equal to five, when the number of distinct support sets\non the rows of the generator matrix m, say, is less than or equal to three, or\nwhen the generator matrix is sparsest and balanced. In this paper, we report on\nfurther progress on the GM-MDS conjecture. In particular, we show that the\nconjecture is true for all m less than equal to six. This generalizes all\nprevious known results (except for the sparsest and balanced case, which is a\nvery special support constraint).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 05:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

The optimal policy maximizing the SU\nthroughput under an interference constraint to the PU and its performance are\nfound in closed form. It is shown that the optimal policy randomizes among\nthree modes: Idle, the SU remains idle over the retransmission window of the\nPU, to avoid causing interference; Interference cancellation, the SU transmits\nonly after decoding the PU packet, to improve its own throughput via\ninterference cancellation; Always transmit, the SU transmits over the\nretransmission window of the PU to maximize the future potential of\ninterference cancellation via chain decoding. This structure is exploited to\ndesign a stochastic optimization algorithm to facilitate learning and\nadaptation when the model parameters are unknown or vary over time, based on\nARQ feedback from the PU and CSI measurements at the SU receiver. It is shown\nnumerically that, for a 10% interference constraint, the optimal access policy\nyields 15% improvement over a state-of-the-art scheme without SU\nretransmissions, and up to 2x gain over a scheme using a non-adaptive access\npolicy instead of the optimal one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 06:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 15:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

Real-time and security-critical tasks, for example,\noften require custom OSes to meet their needs. However, development of special\npurpose OSes is a time-consuming and difficult exercise. Drivers, libraries and\napplications have to be written from scratch or ported from existing sources.\nMany researchers have tackled this problem by developing ways to extend\nexisting systems with application-specific services. However, it is often\ndifficult to ensure an adequate degree of separation between legacy and new\nservices, especially when security and timing requirements are at stake.\nVirtualization, for example, supports logical isolation of separate guest\nservices, but suffers from inadequate temporal isolation of time-critical code\nrequired for real-time systems. This paper presents vLibOS, a master-slave\nparadigm for new systems, whose services are built on legacy code that is\ntemporally and spatially isolated in separate VM domains. Existing OSes are\ntreated as sandboxed libraries, providing legacy services that are requested by\ninter-VM calls, which execute with the time budget of the caller.

We developed a measure to quantify navigation efficiency\nand found that connectomes in a range of mammalian species (human, mouse and\nmacaque) can be successfully navigated with near-optimal efficiency (>80% of\noptimal efficiency for typical connection densities). Rewiring network topology\nor repositioning network nodes resulted in 45%-60% reductions in navigation\nperformance.

Our solution, TritanDB, shows an order of magnitude performance\nimprovement across both Things and cloud hardware on many state-of-the-art\ndatabases within IoT scenarios.

However, recent observations have confirmed the presence of a\nnon-negligible amount of cold gas in the circumstellar (CS) debris discs around\nyoung main-sequence stars.This cold gas has been suggested to be related to the\noutgassing of planetesimals and cometary-like objects. The aim of the paper is\nto investigate the presence of hot gas in the surroundings of stars bearing\ncold-gas debris discs. High-resolution optical spectra of all currently known\ncold-gas-bearing debris-disc systems, with the exception of $\\beta$ Pic and\nFomalhaut, have been obtained from different observatories.We have analysed the\nCa II H & K and the Na I D lines searching for non-photospheric absorptions of\nCS origin, usually attributed to cometary-like activity. Narrow, stable Ca II\nand/or Na I absorption features have been detected superimposed to the\nphotospheric lines in 10 out of the 15 observed cold-gas-bearing debris\ndisc.Features are found at the radial velocity of the stars, or slightly blue-\nor red-shifted, and/or at the velocity of the local interstellar medium (ISM).\nSome stars also present transient variable events or absorptions extended\ntowards red wavelengths. These are the first detections of such Ca II features\nin 7 out of the 15 observed stars. In some of these stars, results suggest that\nthe stable and variable absorptions arise from relatively hot gas located in\nthe CS close-in environment. This hot gas is detected in at least ~80%, of\nedge-on cold-gas-bearing debris discs, while in only ~10% of the discs seen\nclose to face-on. We interpret this as a geometrical effect, and suggest that\nthe non-detection of hot gas absorptions is due to the disc inclination rather\nthan to the absence of the hot-gas component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 12:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

In practice, although many SDP solvers can work\nout some problems of big scale, the efficiency and reliability of such method\ndecrease greatly while the input size increases. Recently, by exploiting the\nsparsity of the input SOS decomposition problem, some preprocessing algorithms\nwere proposed [5,17], which first divide the input problem satisfying special\ndefinitions or properties into smaller SDP problems and then pass the smaller\nones to SDP solvers to obtain reliable results efficiently. A natural question\nis that to what extent the above mentioned preprocessing algorithms work. That\nis, how many polynomials satisfying those definitions or properties are there\nin the SOS polynomials? In this paper, we define a concept of block SOS\ndecomposable polynomials which is a generalization of those special classes in\n[5] and [17]. Roughly speaking, it is a class of polynomials whose SOS\ndecomposition problem can be transformed into smaller ones (in other words, the\ncorresponding SDP matrices can be block-diagnolized) by considering their\nsupports only (coefficients are not considered). Then we prove that the set of\nblock SOS decomposable polynomials has measure zero in the set of SOS\npolynomials. That means if we only consider supports (not with coefficients) of\npolynomials, such algorithms decreasing the size of SDPs for those SDP-based\nSOS solvers can only work on very few polynomials. As a result, this shows that\nthe SOS decomposition problems that can be optimized by the above mentioned\npreprocessing algorithms are very few.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 12:26:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

We evaluate Caucus in terms of its security, using a new model\nfor blockchain-focused leader election, before testing an implementation of\nCaucus on an Ethereum private network. Our experiments highlight that one\nvariant of Caucus costs only $0.10 per leader election if deployed on Ethereum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 12:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 17:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

Moreover, we introduce and compute a\ndepletion factor that enables us to quantify the way in which higher viscosity,\nsmaller planet mass, or a more massive disk can shift this critical size to\nlarger values.

The static model generally overestimates deuteration, which\nis increasingly evident the more D atoms are substituted in the molecule.

Typically one also relies on some\nclassical structure, such as space and local configuration variables within it,\nwhich then gets promoted to an algebra of preferred observables. We argue that\neven such an algebra is unnecessary, and the most basic description of the\nworld is given by the spectrum of the Hamiltonian (a list of energy\neigenvalues) and the components of some particular vector in Hilbert space.\nEverything else - including space and fields propagating on it - is emergent\nfrom these minimal elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 23:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

Timely and cost-effective control of infectious disease\nspread critically relies on uncovering the underlying diffusion mechanisms,\nwhich is challenging due to invisible causality between events and their\ntime-evolving intensity. We infer causal relationships between infections and\nquantify the reflexivity of a meta-population, the level of feedback on event\noccurrences by its internal dynamics (likelihood of a regional outbreak\ntriggered by previous cases). These are enabled by our new proposed model, the\nLatent Influence Point Process (LIPP) which models disease spread by\nincorporating macro-level internal dynamics of meta-populations based on human\nmobility. We analyse 15-year dengue cases in Queensland, Australia. From our\ncausal inference, outbreaks are more likely driven by statewide global\ndiffusion over time, leading to complex behavior of disease spread. In terms of\nreflexivity, precursory growth and symmetric decline in populous regions is\nattributed to slow but persistent feedback on preceding outbreaks via\ninter-group dynamics, while abrupt growth but sharp decline in peripheral areas\nis led by rapid but inconstant feedback via intra-group dynamics. Our proposed\nmodel reveals probabilistic causal relationships between discrete events based\non intra- and inter-group dynamics and also covers direct and indirect\ndiffusion processes (contact-based and vector-borne disease transmissions).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 10:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

In particular, negative material susceptibilities give rise to strong\nresonant interactions with deeply subwavelength particles. While the negative\nelectrical permittivity of natural noble metals manifests itself in localized\nplasmon resonant oscillations, negative magnetic permeability is virtually\nnon-existent in nature.
