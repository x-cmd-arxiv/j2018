For the finite domain with\nsymmetric boundary condition, the critical point for the topological phase\ntransition is equal to the inverse of the domain length. In contrast, the\ncritical point is zero for the semi-infinite domain. Additionally, the symmetry\nof the energy spectrum is found to be sensitive to the boundary conditions of\nthe Rice-Mele model, and the emergence of the edge states as well as the\ntopological phase transition can be reflected in the thermodynamic properties.\nA potentially practical scheme is proposed for simulating the Rice-Mele model\nand detecting the relevant thermodynamic quantities in the context of\nBose-Einstein condensate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 16:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

However, the dynamics governing this process when seeded\nby noise has not yet been investigated in a fully controllable collinear\nenvironment. Here we report the first unambiguous observation of efficient\nnoise-seeded backward stimulated Raman scattering in a hydrogen-filled\nhollow-core photonic crystal fiber. At high gas pressures, when the backward\nRaman gain is comparable with, but lower than, the forward gain, we report\nquantum conversion efficiencies exceeding 40% to the backward Stokes at 683 nm\nfrom a narrowband 532-nm-pump. The efficiency increases to 65% when the\nbackward process is seeded by a small amount of back-reflected\nforward-generated Stokes light. At high pump powers the backward Stokes signal,\nemitted in a clean fundamental mode and spectrally pure, is unexpectedly always\nstronger than its forward-propagating counterpart.

A good\nunderstanding of this process, together with the rapid development of novel\nanti-resonant-guiding hollow-core fibers, may lead to improved designs of\nefficient gas-based Raman lasers and amplifiers operating at wavelengths from\nthe ultraviolet to the mid-infrared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 16:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

In this article, we start a program to systematically\ncharacterize and generalize such rank identities with a view towards\napplications to operator algebras. We initiate the study of so-called ranked\nrings (unital rings with a `rank-system'), the main examples of interest being\nfinite von Neumann algebras, Murray-von Neumann algebras, and von Neumann\nrank-rings. In our framework, a field $\\mathbb{K}$ may be viewed as a ranked\nring with a $\\mathbb{Z}^+$-valued rank-system consisting of the usual rank\nfunctions on $M_n(\\mathbb{K})$ (for $n \\in \\mathbb{N})$ and serves as the\nmotivating example. We show that a finite von Neumann algebra $\\mathscr{R}$\nwith center $\\mathscr{C}$ (and the corresponding Murray-von Neumann algebra\n$\\mathscr{R}_{\\textrm{aff}}$) may be endowed with a $\\mathscr{C}^{+}$-valued\nrank-system, considering $\\mathscr{C}^{+}$ as a commutative monoid with respect\nto operator addition.

However, dynamics after the inflation turned out to have a\nnon-trivial dependence on $f$. For each G-axion model there exists a critical\nvalue of $f_c$ such that for $f>f_c$ we have the oscillating phase after\ninflation and for $f<f_c$ we have non-oscillatory phase.

It is also\ndemonstrated that there exist input-agnostic perturbations, called universal\nadversarial perturbations, which can change the inference of target model on\nmost of the data samples. However, existing methods to craft universal\nperturbations are (i) task specific, (ii) require samples from the training\ndata distribution, and (iii) perform complex optimizations.

Further, via exploiting simple priors related to the\ndata distribution, our objective remarkably boosts the fooling ability of the\ncrafted perturbations.

To generate realistic\nand smooth locomotion, existing methods use motion capture, finite state\nmachines or morphology-specific knowledge to guide the motion generation\nalgorithms. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach for the\nautomatic creation of locomotion control. Indeed, a standard benchmark for DRL\nis to automatically create a running controller for a biped character from a\nsimple reward function. Although several different DRL algorithms can\nsuccessfully create a running controller, the resulting motions usually look\nnothing like a real runner. This paper takes a minimalist learning approach to\nthe locomotion problem, without the use of motion examples, finite state\nmachines, or morphology-specific knowledge. We introduce two modifications to\nthe DRL approach that, when used together, produce locomotion behaviors that\nare symmetric, low-energy, and much closer to that of a real person. First, we\nintroduce a new term to the loss function (not the reward function) that\nencourages symmetric actions. Second, we introduce a new curriculum learning\nmethod that provides modulated physical assistance to help the character with\nleft/right balance and forward movement. The algorithm automatically computes\nappropriate assistance to the character and gradually relaxes this assistance,\nso that eventually the character learns to move entirely without help. Because\nour method does not make use of motion capture data, it can be applied to a\nvariety of character morphologies. We demonstrate locomotion controllers for\nthe lower half of a biped, a full humanoid, a quadruped, and a hexapod. Our\nresults show that learned policies are able to produce symmetric, low-energy\ngaits. In addition, speed-appropriate gait patterns emerge without any guidance\nfrom motion examples or contact planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 17:37:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 20:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 May 2018 14:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

Stability of the discretization approach for under-resolved,\nturbulent flow problems is realized by a purely numerical stabilization\napproach. Consistent penalty terms that enforce the incompressibility\nconstraint as well as inter-element continuity of the velocity field in a weak\nsense render the numerical method a robust discretization scheme in the\nunder-resolved regime.

One\nreason that this approach has not been developed until now has been the lack of\na suitable free energy equation. The Cluster Variation Method (CVM) offers a\nmeans for characterizing 2-D local pattern distributions, or configuration\nvariables, and provides a free energy formalism in terms of these configuration\nvariables. The equilibrium distribution of these configuration variables is\ndefined in terms of a single interaction enthalpy parameter, h, for the case of\nequiprobable distribution of bistate units.

This model\ncontemplates the possibilities of long-term language coexistence or extinction.\nWe establish that the most likely scenario is a sustained coexistence. The data\nneeds to be interpreted under different circumstances, some of them leading to\nthe asymptotic extinction of one of the languages involved. We delimit the\ncases in which this can happen. Asymptotic behavior is often unrealistic as a\npredictor for complex social systems, hence we make an attempt at forecasting\ntrends of speakers towards $2030$.

From photoelectron spectroscopy data, we place conservative upper\nlimits on the XUV pulse duration and photon energy bandwidth of 93 fs and 65\nmeV, respectively. The high photocurrent, lack of space charge distortions of\nthe photoelectron spectra, and excellent isolation of individual harmonic\norders allow us to observe the laser-assisted photoelectric effect with\nsideband amplitudes as low as $6 \\times 10^{-4}$, enabling time-resolved XUV\nphotoemission experiments in a qualitatively new regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 18:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 14:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

In\na series of articles, Tremblin et al. proposed that some of the yet unexplained\nfeatures associated to these transitions could be explained by a reduction of\nthe thermal gradient near the photosphere. To explain, in turn, this more\nisothermal profile, they invoke the presence of an instability analogous to\nfingering convection -- compositional convection -- triggered by the change in\nmean molecular weight of the gas due to the chemical transitions mentioned\nabove. In this short note, we use existing arguments to demonstrate that any\nturbulent transport, if present, would in fact increase the thermal gradient.\nThis misinterpretation comes from the fact that turbulence mixes/homogenizes\nentropy (potential temperature) instead of temperature. So, while increasing\ntransport, turbulence in an initially stratified atmosphere actually carries\nenergy downward, whether it is due to fingering or any other type of\ncompositional convection.

An analogous protocol\nis used in the fault-tolerant setting, where tetrons and hexons are replaced by\nMajorana surface code patches, and parity measurements are replaced by lattice\nsurgery, still only requiring local few-Majorana parity measurements. To this\nend, we discuss twist defects in Majorana fermion surface codes and adapt the\ntechnique of twist-based lattice surgery to fermionic codes. Moreover, we\npropose a new family of codes that we refer to as Majorana color codes, which\nare obtained by concatenating Majorana surface codes with small Majorana\nfermion codes. Majorana surface and color codes can be used to decrease the\nspace overhead and stabilizer weight compared to their bosonic counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 19:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

This contrasts with other hybrid approaches that alternate\nthe execution of localization algorithms for each type of measurement\nseparately, to progressively refine the position estimates.

In\nmodels that include additional non-compact spacetime dimensions, as the\ngravitational waves propagate, they \"leak\" into the extra dimensions, leading\nto a reduction in the amplitude of the observed gravitational waves, and a\ncommensurate systematic error in the inferred distance to the gravitational\nwave source. Electromagnetic waves would remain unaffected. We compare the\ninferred distance to GW170817 from the observation of gravitational waves,\n$d_L^\\mathrm{GW}$, with the inferred distance to the electromagnetic\ncounterpart NGC 4993, $d_L^\\mathrm{EM}$.

The most widely\naccepted methodologies tend to generalise M&V so as to ensure applicability\nacross the spectrum of energy conservation measures (ECM's). These do not\nprovide a rigid calculation procedure to follow. This paper aims to bridge the\ngap between high-level methodologies and the practical application of modelling\nalgorithms, with a focus on the industrial buildings sector. This is achieved\nwith the development of a novel, machine learning supported methodology for M&V\n2.0 which enables accurate quantification of savings.\n  A novel and computationally efficient feature selection algorithm and\npowerful machine learning regression algorithms are employed to maximise the\neffectiveness of available data. The baseline period energy consumption is\nmodelled using artificial neural networks, support vector machines, k-nearest\nneighbours and multiple ordinary least squares regression. Improved knowledge\ndiscovery and an expanded boundary of analysis allow more complex energy\nsystems be analysed, thus increasing the applicability of M&V. A case study in\na large biomedical manufacturing facility is used to demonstrate the\nmethodology's ability to accurately quantify the savings under real-world\nconditions. The ECM was found to result in 604,527 kWh of energy savings with\n57% uncertainty at a confidence interval of 68%. 20 baseline energy models are\ndeveloped using an exhaustive approach with the optimal model being used to\nquantify savings. The range of savings estimated with each model are presented\nand the acceptability of uncertainty is reviewed. The case study demonstrates\nthe ability of the methodology to perform M&V to an acceptable standard in\nchallenging circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 20:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

Magnetic diffusion is seen as a pathway to resolving this long-standing\nproblem. We investigate the impact of including resistive MHD in simulations of\nthe gravitational collapse of a 1 solar mass gas sphere, from molecular cloud\ndensities to the formation of the protostellar seed; the second Larson core. We\nused the AMR code RAMSES to perform two 3D simulations of collapsing magnetised\ngas spheres, including self-gravity, radiative transfer, and a non-ideal gas\nequation of state to describe H2 dissociation which leads to the second\ncollapse. The first run was carried out under the ideal MHD approximation,\nwhile ambipolar and ohmic diffusion was incorporated in the second calculation.\nIn the ideal MHD simulation, the magnetic field dominates the energy budget\neverywhere inside and around the first core, fueling interchange instabilities\nand driving a low-velocity outflow. High magnetic braking removes essentially\nall angular momentum from the second core. On the other hand, ambipolar and\nohmic diffusion create a barrier which prevents amplification of the magnetic\nfield beyond 0.1 G in the first Larson core which is now fully thermally\nsupported. A significant amount of rotation is preserved and a small\nKeplerian-like disk forms around the second core. When studying the radiative\nefficiency of the first and second core accretion shocks, we found that it can\nvary by several orders of magnitude over the 3D surface of the cores. Magnetic\ndiffusion is a pre-requisite to star-formation; it enables the formation of\nprotoplanetary disks in which planets will eventually form, and also plays a\ndeterminant role in the formation of the protostar itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 21:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 11:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

CO ice is not\ndetected towards sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and upper limits put\nits relative abundance well below sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the\nMilky Way. We use our gas-grain chemical code MAGICKAL, with multiple grain\nsizes and grain temperatures, and further expand it with a treatment for\nincreased interstellar radiation field intensity to model the elevated dust\ntemperatures observed in the MCs. We also adjust the elemental abundances used\nin the chemical models, guided by observations of HII regions in these\nmetal-poor satellite galaxies. With a grid of models, we are able to reproduce\nthe relative ice fractions observed in MC massive young stellar objects\n(MYSOs), indicating that metal depletion and elevated grain temperature are\nimportant drivers of the MYSO envelope ice composition. Magellanic Cloud\nelemental abundances have a sub-galactic C/O ratio, increasing H$_2$O ice\nabundances relative to the other ices; elevated grain temperatures favor CO$_2$\nproduction over H$_2$O and CO. The observed shortfall in CO in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud can be explained by a combination of reduced carbon abundance\nand increased grain temperatures. The models indicate that a large variation in\nradiation field strength is required to match the range of observed LMC\nabundances.

However, how this disequilibrium changed over time and, in\nparticular, the biogenic disequilibria maintained in the anoxic Archean or less\noxic Proterozoic eons are unknown. We calculate the atmosphere-ocean\ndisequilibrium in the Precambrian using conservative proxy- and model-based\nestimates of early atmospheric and oceanic compositions. We omit crustal solids\nbecause subsurface composition is not detectable on exoplanets, unlike\nabove-surface volatiles. We find that (i) disequilibrium increased through time\nin step with the rise of oxygen; (ii) both the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic may\nhave had remotely detectable biogenic disequilibria due to the coexistence of\nO$_{2}$, N$_{2}$, and liquid water; and (iii) the Archean had a biogenic\ndisequilibrium caused by the coexistence of N$_2$, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, and liquid\nwater, which, for an exoplanet twin, may be remotely detectable. On the basis\nof this disequilibrium, we argue that the simultaneous detection of abundant\nCH$_{4}$ and CO$_{2}$ in a habitable exoplanet's atmosphere is a potential\nbiosignature. Specifically, we show that methane mixing ratios greater than\n0.001 are potentially biogenic, whereas those exceeding 0.01 are likely\nbiogenic due to the difficulty in maintaining large abiotic methane fluxes to\nsupport high methane levels in anoxic atmospheres. Biogenicity would be\nstrengthened by the absence of abundant CO, which should not coexist in a\nbiological scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 21:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

We recently examined this scenario and\nshowed that such impacts can in fact excavate ice and present a plausible\nmechanism for triggering the activation of MBCs (Haghighipour et al. 2016).\nHowever, because the purpose of that study was to prove the concept and\nidentify the most viable ice-longevity model, the porosity of the object and\nthe loss of ice due to the heat of impact were ignored. In this paper, we\nextend our impact simulations to porous materials and account for the loss of\nice due to an impact. We show that for a porous MBC, impact craters are deeper,\nreaching to approximately 15 m implying that if the activation of MBCs is due\nto the sublimation of sub-surface ice, this ice has to be within the top 15 m\nof the object. Results also indicate that the loss of ice due to the heat of\nimpact is negligible, and the re-accretion of ejected ice is small. The latter\nsuggests that the activities of current MBCs are most probably from multiple\nimpact sites. Our study also indicates that in order for sublimation from\nmultiple sites to account for the observed activity of the currently known\nMBCs, the water content of MBCs (and their parent asteroids) needs to be larger\nthan the values traditionally considered in models of terrestrial planet\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

In\nthis paper, we consider simulating event time data with a continuous\ntime-varying covariate whose values vary with time through multiple drug\nadministration cycles, and whose effect on survival changes differently before\nand after a threshold within each cycle. The latter accommodates settings with\na zero-protection biomarker threshold above which the drug provides a varying\nlevel of protection depending on the biomarker level, but below which the drug\nprovides no protection. We propose two simulation approaches: one based on\nsimulating survival data under a single-dose regimen first before data are\naggregated over multiple doses, and another based on simulating survival data\ndirectly under a multiple-dose regimen. We generate time-to-event data\nfollowing a Cox proportional hazards model based on inverting the cumulative\nhazard function and a log link function for relating the hazard function to the\ncovariates. The method's validity is assessed in two sets of simulation\nexperiments.

The proposed\nCSSCA algorithm can also handle stochastic non-convex constraints in\noptimization problems, and it opens the way to solving more challenging\noptimization problems that occur in many applications. The algorithm is based\non solving a sequence of convex objective/feasibility optimization problems\nobtained by replacing the objective/constraint functions in the original\nproblems with some convex surrogate functions.

In conventional hybrid precoding, both RF and\nbaseband precoders are adaptive to the real-time channel state information\n(CSI). As a result, an individual RF precoder is required for each subcarrier\nin wideband systems, leading to high implementation cost. To overcome this\nissue, two-timescale hybrid precoding (THP), which adapts the RF precoder to\nthe channel statistics, has been proposed. Since the channel statistics are\napproximately the same over different subcarriers, only a single RF precoder is\nrequired in THP. Despite the advantages of THP, there lacks a unified and\nefficient algorithm for its optimization due to the non-convex and stochastic\nnature of the problem.

Ferroelectric (FE) and\nmultiferroic (MF) orders and their manipulation promises an ideal combination\nof state variables to reach atto-Joule range for logic and memory (i.e., ~ 30X\nlower switching energy than nanoelectronics). In BiFeO3 the coupling between\nthe antiferromagnetic (AFM) and FE orders is robust at room temperature,\nscalable in voltage, stabilized by the FE order, and can be integrated into a\nfabrication process for a beyond-CMOS era. The presence of the AFM order and a\ncanted magnetic moment in this system causes exchange interaction with a\nferromagnet such as CoFe or LSMO. While previous work has shown that exchange\ncoupling (uniaxial anisotropy) can be controlled with an electric field,\nseveral puzzling issues remain.

We implement and validate lossy\nboson sampling with one and two photons lost, and obtain sampling rates of 187\nkHz, 13.6 kHz, and 0.78 kHz for five-, six- and seven-photon boson sampling\nwith two photons lost, which is 9.4, 13.9, and 18.0 times faster than the\nstandard boson sampling, respectively. Our experiment shows an approach to\nsignificantly enhance the sampling rate of multiphoton boson sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 06:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

The recommended results\nfor a user are consequently limited to simple patterns and cannot be extended\nreasonably. Moreover, news recommendation also faces the challenges of high\ntime-sensitivity of news and dynamic diversity of users' interests. To solve\nthe above problems, in this paper, we propose a deep knowledge-aware network\n(DKN) that incorporates knowledge graph representation into news\nrecommendation. DKN is a content-based deep recommendation framework for\nclick-through rate prediction. The key component of DKN is a multi-channel and\nword-entity-aligned knowledge-aware convolutional neural network (KCNN) that\nfuses semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news. KCNN treats\nwords and entities as multiple channels, and explicitly keeps their alignment\nrelationship during convolution. In addition, to address users' diverse\ninterests, we also design an attention module in DKN to dynamically aggregate a\nuser's history with respect to current candidate news. Through extensive\nexperiments on a real online news platform, we demonstrate that DKN achieves\nsubstantial gains over state-of-the-art deep recommendation models.

Most reinforcement learning methods use an\nestimate of the value function, which captures how good it is for the agent to\nbe in a particular state and is mathematically expressed as the expected sum of\ndiscounted future rewards (called the return). These values can be\nstraightforwardly estimated by averaging batches of returns using Monte Carlo\nmethods. However, if we wish to update the agent's value estimates during\nlearning--before terminal outcomes are observed--we must use a different\nestimation target called the {\\lambda}-return, which truncates the return with\nthe agent's own estimate of the value function. Temporal difference learning\nmethods estimate the expected {\\lambda}-return for each state, allowing these\nmethods to update online and incrementally, and in most cases achieve better\ngeneralization error and faster learning than Monte Carlo methods. Naturally\none could attempt to estimate higher-order moments of the {\\lambda}-return.\nThis paper is about estimating the variance of the {\\lambda}-return. Prior work\nhas shown that given estimates of the variance of the {\\lambda}-return,\nlearning systems can be constructed to (1) mitigate risk in action selection,\nand (2) automatically adapt the parameters of the learning process itself to\nimprove performance. Unfortunately, existing methods for estimating the\nvariance of the {\\lambda}-return are complex and not well understood\nempirically. We contribute a method for estimating the variance of the\n{\\lambda}-return directly using policy evaluation methods from reinforcement\nlearning. Our approach is significantly simpler than prior methods that\nindependently estimate the second moment of the {\\lambda}-return.

Most of\nthe existing group signature schemes, however, do not guarantee security once\nsecret keys are exposed. To reduce potential damages caused by key exposure\nattacks, Song (ACMCCS 2001) put forward the concept of forward-secure group\nsignature (FSGS), which prevents attackers from forging group signatures\npertaining to past time periods even if a secret group signing key is revealed\nat the current time period.

By equipping\nthe base stations (BSs) with tens or hundreds of antenna elements, narrow and\nhigh gain beams can be used to spatially multiplex several user equipment (UE)\ndevices. While increasing the achievable performance, focusing the transmit\npower into specific UE directions also poses new issues when performing the\nradio frequency (RF) exposure assessment. In fact, the spatial distribution of\nthe actual BS transmit power strongly depends on the deployment scenario and on\nthe position of the UEs. Traditional methods for assessing the RF exposure\ncompliance boundaries around BS sites are generally based on maximum transmit\npower and static beams. In massive MIMO systems, these approaches tend to be\nvery conservative, in particular when time averaging is properly considered. In\nthis work, we propose to leverage the three dimensional spatial channel model\nstandardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project in order to assess\nreasonably foreseeable compliance boundaries of massive MIMO BSs.

The deep hash functions are then learned through two networks by\nminimizing the gap between the learned features and discrete codes.\nFurthermore, since the binary codes in the Hamming space also should keep the\nsemantic affinity existing in the original space, another asymmetric pairwise\nloss is introduced to capture the similarity between the binary codes and\nreal-value features. This asymmetric loss not only improves the retrieval\nperformance, but also contributes to a quick convergence at the training phase.\nBy taking advantage of the two-stream deep structures and two types of\nasymmetric pairwise functions, an alternating algorithm is designed to optimize\nthe deep features and high-quality binary codes efficiently. Experimental\nresults on three real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our approach as compared with state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 11:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

The classical paradigm assumes a\ndistinguished initial state, comprised of a set of facts, and is defined over a\nset of actions which change that state in one way or another. Planning in many\nreal-world settings, however, is much more involved: an agent's knowledge is\nalmost never simply a set of facts that are true, and actions that the agent\nintends to execute never operate the way they are supposed to. Thus,\nprobabilistic planning attempts to incorporate stochastic models directly into\nthe planning process. In this article, we briefly report on probabilistic\nplanning through the lens of probabilistic programming: a programming paradigm\nthat aims to ease the specification of structured probability distributions. In\nparticular, we provide an overview of the features of two systems, HYPE and\nALLEGRO, which emphasise different strengths of probabilistic programming that\nare particularly useful for complex modelling issues raised in probabilistic\nplanning. Among other things, with these systems, one can instantiate planning\nproblems with growing and shrinking state spaces, discrete and continuous\nprobability distributions, and non-unique prior distributions in a first-order\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 11:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

At the node\nlevel they are written in terms of a set of ODEs with a nonlinearity that is\ntypically a sigmoidal shape. Using structural data from brain atlases they may\nbe connected into a network to investigate the emergence of functional dynamic\nstates, such as synchrony. With the simple restriction of the classic sigmoidal\nnonlinearity to a piecewise linear caricature we show that the famous\nWilson-Cowan neural mass model can be analysed at both the node and network\nlevel. The construction of periodic orbits at the node level is achieved by\npatching together matrix exponential solutions, and stability is determined\nusing Floquet theory. For networks with interactions described by circulant\nmatrices, we show that the stability of the synchronous state can be determined\nin terms of a low-dimensional Floquet problem parameterised by the eigenvalues\nof the interaction matrix. This network Floquet problem is readily solved using\nlinear algebra, to predict the onset of spatio-temporal network patterns\narising from a synchronous instability. We consider the case of a discontinuous\nchoice for the node nonlinearity, namely the replacement of the sigmoid by a\nHeaviside nonlinearity. This gives rise to a continuous-time switching network.\nAt the node level this allows for the existence of unstable sliding periodic\norbits, which we construct. The stability of a periodic orbit is now treated\nwith a modification of Floquet theory to treat the evolution of small\nperturbations through switching manifolds via saltation matrices. At the\nnetwork level the stability analysis of the synchronous state is considerably\nmore challenging.

As a result of\nmissing experimental capabilities to probe the complex electron dynamics and\ncompeting instabilities, this impedes the development of compact laser-based\nnext generation secondary radiation sources, e.g. for tumor therapy\n[Bulanov2002,ledingham2007], laboratory-astrophysics\n[Remington1999,Bulanov2015], and fusion [Tabak2014].

With conventional\nconstantcomposition distribution matching (CCDM), all output sequences have\nidentical composition. In this paper, we propose multisetpartition distribution\nmatching (MPDM) where the composition is constant over all output sequences.\nWhen considering the desired distribution as a multiset, MPDM corresponds to\npartitioning this multiset into equal-size subsets. We show that MPDM allows to\naddress more output sequences and thus has lower rate loss than CCDM in all\nnontrivial cases. By imposing some constraints on the partitioning, a\nconstructive MPDM algorithm is proposed which comprises two parts. A\nvariable-length prefix of the binary data word determines the composition to be\nused, and the remainder of the input word is mapped with a conventional CCDM\nalgorithm, such as arithmetic coding, according to the chosen composition.\nSimulations of 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation over the additive white\nGaussian noise channel demonstrate that the block-length saving of MPDM over\nCCDM for a fixed gap to capacity is approximately a factor of 2.5 to 5 at\nmedium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 18:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

This means that an\nadditional, \"interaction\" tensor has to be present.

In this paper,\nwe develop an alternative to the backpropagation without the use of the\nGradient Descent Algorithm, but instead we are going to devise a new algorithm\nto find the error in the weights and biases of an artificial neuron using\nMoore-Penrose Pseudo Inverse. The numerical studies and the experiments\nperformed on various datasets are used to verify the working of this\nalternative algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 05:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

The\ndecomposition-based MOEAs emphasize convergence and diversity in a simple model\nand have made a great success in dealing with theoretical and practical multi-\nor many-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we focus on update\nstrategies of the decomposition- based MOEAs, and their criteria for comparing\nsolutions. Three disadvantages of the decomposition-based MOEAs with local\nupdate strategies and several existing criteria for comparing solutions are\nanalyzed and discussed. And a global loop update strategy and two hybrid\ncriteria are suggested. Subsequently, an evolutionary algorithm with the global\nloop update is implement- ed and compared to several of the best multi- or\nmany-objective optimization algorithms on two famous unconstraint test suites\nwith up to 15 objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that unlike\nevolutionary algorithms with local update strategies, the population of our\nalgorithm does not degenerate at any generation of its evolution, which\nguarantees the diversity of the resulting population. In addition, our\nalgorithm wins in most instances of the two test suites, indicating that it is\nvery compet- itive in terms of convergence and diversity. Running results of\nour algorithm with different criteria for comparing solutions are also\ncompared. Their differences are very significant, indicating that the\nperformance of our algorithm is affected by the criterion it adopts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}
