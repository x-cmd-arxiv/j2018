Numerical simulation of multiphase flow requires solving of a\nlarge, sparse linear system resulting from the discretization of the partial\ndifferential equations modeling the flow. In the case of multiphase\nmulticomponent flow with miscible effect, this is a very challenging task. The\nproblem becomes even more difficult if phase transitions are taken into\naccount. A new approach to handle phase transitions is to formulate the system\nas a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP). Unlike in the primary variable\nswitching technique, the set of primary variables in this approach is fixed\neven when there is phase transition. Not only does this improve the robustness\nof the nonlinear solver, it opens up the possibility to use multigrid methods\nto solve the resulting linear system. The disadvantage of the complementarity\napproach, however, is that when a phase disappears, the linear system has the\nstructure of a saddle point problem and becomes indefinite, and current\nalgebraic multigrid (AMG) algorithms cannot be applied directly. In this study,\nwe explore the effectiveness of a new multilevel strategy, based on the\nmultigrid reduction technique, to deal with problems of this type. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the method through numerical results for the\ncase of two-phase, two-component flow with phase appearance/disappearance.

A novel technique has been developed for comparing biographical\ninformation, by combining the average impact of Levenshtein,\nDamerau-Levenshtein, and editor distances. The impact is calculated as the\nratio of the edit distance to the maximum possible edit distance between two\nstrings of the same lengths as the given pair of strings.

Apart from the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies, the most crucial datasets potentially carrying the DDE\nsignature are: i) baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), and ii) direct large\nscale structure (LSS) formation data (i.e. the observations on\n$f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts). As it turns out, analyses mainly\nfocusing on CMB and with insufficient BAO+LSS input, or those just making use\nof gravitational weak-lensing data for the description of structure formation,\ngenerally fail to capture the DDE signature, whereas the few existing studies\nusing a rich set of CMB+BAO+LSS data (see in particular Sol\\`a, G\\'omez-Valent\n& de Cruz P\\'erez 2015,2017; and Zhao et al. 2017) do converge to the\nremarkable conclusion that DDE might well be encoded in the current\ncosmological observations.

By\nperforming a detailed study on the matter and vacuum perturbations within the\nRVMs, and comparing with the XCDM, we show why the running vacuum fully relaxes\nthe existing $\\sigma_8$-tension and accounts for the LSS formation data much\nbetter than the concordance model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 17:40:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 10:57:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 09:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 10:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

However, ion\nmigration in the perovskite films leads to device degradation and impedes large\nscale commercial applications. We use transient ion-drift measurements to\nquantify activation energy, diffusion coefficient, and concentration of mobile\nions in methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells, and find\nthat their properties change close to the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase\ntransition temperature. We identify three migrating ion species which we\nattribute to the migration of iodide (I-) and methylammonium (MA+). We find\nthat the concentration of mobile MA+ ions is one order of magnitude higher than\nthe one of mobile I- ions, and that the diffusion coefficient of mobile MA+\nions is three orders of magnitude lower than the one for mobile I- ions. We\nfurthermore observe that the activation energy of mobile I- ions (0.29 eV) is\nhighly reproducible for different devices, while the activation energy of\nmobile MA+ depends strongly on device fabrication. This quantification of\nmobile ions in MAPbI3 will lead to a better understanding of ion migration and\nits role in operation and degradation of perovskite solar cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 18:34:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 11:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

In this\npaper we introduce a single, flat ED extension of the kinetic-mixing/dark\nphoton (DP) portal for dark matter (DM) interactions with the Standard Model\n(SM) assuming a compactification `radius' of order $R^{-1}\\sim10-1000$ MeV and\nexamine the resulting modifications to and augmentation of the usual DP\nphenomenology. In the present scenario, both the DP and DM experience the full\n5-D while the SM fields are constrained to lie on a 4-D brane at the boundary\nof the ED. Such a setup can naturally yield the observed value of the DM relic\ndensity and explain the required rough degeneracy of the DM and DP masses\nneeded to obtain it. Gauge symmetry breaking can occur via boundary conditions\nwithout the introduction of an additional singlet Higgs scalar thus avoiding\nall constraints associated with the coupling of such a field to the usual SM\nHiggs field in 5-D. The self-consistency of the field redefinitions that map\nthe gauge fields into a canonical basis and thus removing the kinetic mixing\nterms is found to lead to a strong model building constraint on the ED setup\ninvolving a brane localized kinetic term for the 5-D gauge field on the SM\nbrane. Multiple variations of this scenario are found to be possible which are\nconsistent with all current experimental constraints but which predict very\ndifferent phenomenologies. In this paper, after setting up the general model\nformalism, we discuss in detail the case of a complex scalar 5-D DM field,\nconsistent with constraints arising from the CMB, which may or may not obtain a\nvacuum expectation value (vev). The resulting Kaluza-Klein (KK) towers of both\nthe DM and DP fields are found to yield interesting and distinctive signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 18:44:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 15:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 13:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 16:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 16:51:16 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 12:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

We utilize two parameters:\nthe first one breaks PT-symmetry but retains a proportionality between the\nimaginary and the derivative of the real part of the potential; the second one,\ndetunes from this latter proportionality. It is shown that the departure of the\npotential from the PT -symmetric form does not allow for the numerical\nidentification of exact stationary solutions. Nevertheless, it is of crucial\nimportance to consider the dynamical evolution of initial beam profiles. In\nthat light, we define a suitable notion of optimization and find that even for\nnon PT-symmetric cases, the beam dynamics, both in 1D and 2D -although prone to\nweak growth or decay- suggests that the optimized profiles do not change\nsignificantly under propagation for specific parameter regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 18:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

This paper investigates how simple\nmorphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth\nfrom featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images.\nDifferences are identified, which are likely due to the limited resolution of\nthe simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical\nevolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes.\nSpecifically, for stellar masses $M_{\\star}\\lesssim10^{11}M_{\\odot}$, a larger\nproportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible\nsubstructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses,\nsimulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar morphology\ndistributions.

When $M_{\\star}\\gtrsim10^{11}M_{\\odot}$, the Illustris\ndataset contains fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously\nfeatured.

The outer part of this\ncollapse remains optically thin, and has been studied intensively using\nnumerical simulations. However, the innermost region of the collapse is\nexpected to become optically thick and requires us to follow the radiation\nfield in order to understand its subsequent evolution. So far, the adiabatic\napproximation has been used exclusively for this purpose. We apply radiative\ntransfer in the flux-limited diffusion (FLD) approximation to solve the\nevolution of coupled gas and radiation, for isolated halos. For direct collapse\nwithin isolated DM halos, we find that (1) the photosphere forms at ~10^{-6} pc\nand rapidly expands outward. (2) A central core forms, with a mass of ~1 Mo,\nsupported by thermal gas pressure gradients and rotation. (3) Growing thermal\ngas and radiation pressure gradients dissolve it. (4) This process is\nassociated with a strong anisotropic outflow, and another core forms nearby and\ngrows rapidly. (5) Typical radiation luminosity emerging from the photosphere\nencompassing these cores is ~5 x 10^{37}-5 x 10^{38} erg/s, of order the\nEddington luminosity. (6) Two variability timescales are associated with this\nprocess: a long one, which is related to the accretion flow within the central\n~10^{-4}-10^{-3} pc, and ~0.1 yr, which is related to radiation diffusion. (7)\nAdiabatic models have been run for comparison and their evolution differs\nprofoundly from that of the FLD models, by forming a central\ngeometrically-thick disk.

Therefore,\nthe question arises: What is the connection of nonlinearity to the underlying\nspectral properties of the flow when the nonlinear properties are related to\nthe associated transport mechanisms describing the geometry of the flow? The\npresent work is aimed at addressing this question. Based on the connection\nbetween observed spectral and nonlinear (time series) properties of two X-ray\nbinaries: GRS 1915+105 and Sco X-1, we attempt to diagnose the underlying\naccretion modes of the sources in terms of known accretion classes, namely,\nKeplerian disc, slim disc, advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and\ngeneral advective accretion flow (GAAF). We explore the possible transition of\nthe sources from one accretion mode to others with time. We further argue that\nthe accretion rate must play an important role in transition between these\nmodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 19:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

Understanding properties of stellar\nmagnetic fields in these stars finds a broad application in astrophysics,\nincluding, e.g., theory of stellar dynamos and environment conditions around\nplanets that may be orbiting these stars.

We analyzed an equatorial\ncoronal-hole jet observed by SDO/AIA on 09 January 2014, in which the\nmagnetic-field structure was consistent with the embedded-bipole topology that\nwe identified and modeled previously as an origin of coronal jets.

As new\nevents are accepted, they are matched using some type of evaluation structure,\ncommonly optimized according to the statistical properties of the data items in\nthe input stream. However, in many real-life scenarios the data characteristics\nare never known in advance or are subject to frequent on-the-fly changes. To\nmodify the evaluation structure as a reaction to such changes, adaptation\nmechanisms are employed.

To do so we use the weak field limit of an alternative theory\nof dark matter known as MOG in the literature. The galaxy model in MOG has the\nsame initial conditions as in galaxy models with dark matter halo.

Independent vector analysis (IVA) extends the applicability\nof ICA by jointly decomposing multiple datasets through the exploitation of the\ndependencies across datasets. Though both ICA and IVA algorithms cast in the\nmaximum likelihood (ML) framework enable the use of all available statistical\ninformation in reality, they often deviate from their theoretical optimality\nproperties due to improper estimation of the probability density function\n(PDF). This motivates the development of flexible ICA and IVA algorithms that\nclosely adhere to the underlying statistical description of the data. Although\nit is attractive minimize the assumptions, important prior information about\nthe data, such as sparsity, is usually available. If incorporated into the ICA\nmodel, use of this additional information can relax the independence\nassumption, resulting in an improvement in the overall separation performance.\nTherefore, the development of a unified mathematical framework that can take\ninto account both statistical independence and sparsity is of great interest.\nIn this work, we first introduce a flexible ICA algorithm that uses an\neffective PDF estimator to accurately capture the underlying statistical\nproperties of the data. We then discuss several techniques to accurately\nestimate the parameters of the multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution,\nand how to integrate them into the IVA model.

Because manual 3D\nsegmentation is prohibitively time consuming and requires radiological\nexperience, current practices rely on an imprecise surrogate called response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Despite their coarseness, RECIST\nmarks are commonly found in current hospital picture and archiving systems\n(PACS), meaning they can provide a potentially powerful, yet extraordinarily\nchallenging, source of weak supervision for full 3D segmentation.

First, we propose fast\nmethods to replace points from a subset $\\mathcal{X} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$,\nassociated with the Euclidean metric, with points in the cube $\\{\\pm 1\\}^m$ and\nwe associate the cube with a pseudo-metric that approximates Euclidean distance\namong points in $\\mathcal{X}$. Our methods rely on quantizing fast\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings based on bounded orthonormal systems and\npartial circulant ensembles, both of which admit fast transforms. Our\nquantization methods utilize noise-shaping, and include Sigma-Delta schemes and\ndistributed noise-shaping schemes. The resulting approximation errors decay\npolynomially and exponentially fast in $m$, depending on the embedding method.\nThis dramatically outperforms the current decay rates associated with binary\nembeddings and Hamming distances. Additionally, it is the first such binary\nembedding result that applies to fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss maps while\npreserving $\\ell_2$ norms.\n  Second, we again consider noise-shaping schemes, albeit this time to quantize\ncompressed sensing measurements arising from bounded orthonormal ensembles and\npartial circulant matrices. We show that these methods yield a reconstruction\nerror that again decays with the number of measurements (and bits), when using\nconvex optimization for reconstruction. Specifically, for Sigma-Delta schemes,\nthe error decays polynomially in the number of measurements, and it decays\nexponentially for distributed noise-shaping schemes based on beta encoding.\nThese results are near optimal and the first of their kind dealing with bounded\northonormal systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 17:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

The study clarifies the important role of the fourth-order\nsymmetry energy in determining the properties of nuclear matter at extreme\nisospin or density conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 04:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

High throughput technology\nhas made such studies possible: in a given tissue sample, it enables us to\nquantify the expression levels of approximately 20,000 genes and to record the\nalleles present at millions of genetic polymorphisms. While obtaining this data\nis relatively cheap once a specimen is at hand, obtaining human tissue remains\na costly endeavor. Thus, eQTL studies continue to be based on relatively small\nsample sizes, with this limitation particularly serious for tissues of most\nimmediate medical relevance. Given the high dimensional nature of this datasets\nand the large number of hypotheses tested, the scientific community has adopted\nearly on multiplicity adjustment procedures, which primarily control the false\ndiscoveries rate for the identification of genetic variants with influence on\nthe expression levels.

Depending on the detector\nlight yield, several scintillation photons stemming from the same neutrino\ninteraction are likely to hit a single PMT in a few tens/hundreds of\nnanoseconds, resulting in several photoelectrons (PEs) to pile-up at the PMT\nanode. In such scenario, the signal generated by each PE is entangled to the\nothers, and an accurate PMT charge reconstruction becomes challenging. This\nmanuscript describes an experimental method able to address the PMT charge\nreconstruction in the case of large PE pile-up, providing an unbiased charge\nestimator at the permille level up to 15 detected PEs. The method is based on a\nsignal filtering technique (Wiener filter) which suppresses the noise due to\nboth PMT and readout electronics, and on a Fourier-based deconvolution able to\nminimize the influence of signal distortions ---such as an overshoot. The\nanalysis of simulated PMT waveforms shows that the slope of a linear regression\nmodeling the relation between reconstructed and true charge values improves\nfrom $0.769 \\pm 0.001$ (without deconvolution) to $0.989 \\pm 0.001$ (with\ndeconvolution), where unitary slope implies perfect reconstruction.

In this study, physical phenomena for degradation and\nfailure in exfoliated single-crystal h-BN films were investigated using the\nconstant-voltage stress test. At low electrical fields, the current gradually\nreduced and saturated with time, while the current increased at electrical\nfields higher than ~8 MV/cm and finally resulted in the catastrophic dielectric\nbreakdown. These transient behaviors may be due to carrier trapping to the\ndefect sites in h-BN because trapped carriers lower or enhance the electrical\nfields in h-BN depending on their polarities. The key finding is the current\nenhancement with time at the high electrical field, suggesting the accumulation\nof electrons generated by the impact ionization process. Therefore, a\ntheoretical model including the electron generation rate by impact ionization\nprocess was developed. The experimental data support the expected degradation\nmechanism of h-BN. Moreover, the impact ionization coefficient was successfully\nextracted, which is comparable to that of SiO2, even though the fundamental\nband gap for h-BN is smaller than that for SiO2. Therefore, the dominant impact\nionization in h-BN could be band-to-band excitation, not defect-assisted impact\nionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 09:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-29"}

They drive the\nevolution of planetary systems and the rotational dynamics of planets.

Our goal is\nto investigate in a consistant way the importance of the contribution of\ninternal gravity waves in the oceanic tidal response and to propose a modeling\nallowing to treat a wide range of cases from shallow to deep oceans. A 3D ab\ninitio model is developed to study the dynamics of a global planetary ocean.\nThis model takes into account compressibility, stratification and sphericity\nterms, which are usually ignored in 2D approaches. An analytic solution is\ncomputed and used to study the dependence of the tidal response on the tidal\nfrequency and on the ocean depth and stratification. In the 2D asymptotic\nlimit, we recover the frequency-resonant behaviour due to surface\ninertial-gravity waves identified by early studies. As the ocean depth and\nBrunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency increase, the contribution of internal gravity\nwaves grows in importance and the tidal response become three-dimensional. In\nthe case of deep oceans, the stable stratification induces resonances that can\nincrease the tidal dissipation rate by several orders of magnitude. It is thus\nable to affect significantly the evolution time scale of the planetary\nrotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 10:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Our study suggests the possible existence of a new\nlow-temperature phase for CsH$_2$PO$_4$, not yet reported experimentally.\nFinally, we report the implementation of DFT-D contributions to elastic\nconstants within DFPT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 11:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-29"}

As the costs of\nrunning faulty algorithms at scale can be severe, it is highly desirable to\nverify the correctness of the translation, i.e., to prove that the MapReduce\nversion is equivalent to the imperative original. We present a novel approach\nfor proving equivalence between imperative and MapReduce algorithms based on\npartitioning the equivalence proof into a sequence of equivalence proofs\nbetween intermediate programs with smaller differences. Our approach is based\non the insight that two kinds of sub-proofs are required: (1) uniform\ntransformations changing the controlflow structure that are mostly independent\nof the particular context in which they are applied; and (2) context-dependent\ntransformations that are not uniform but that preserve the overall structure\nand can be proved correct using coupling invariants. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our approach by evaluating it on two prototypical algorithms\ncommonly used as examples in MapReduce frameworks: k-means and PageRank. To\ncarry out the proofs, we use the interactive theorem prover Coq with partial\nproof automation.

Based on a suitable rheological model [S. M. Fielding and P.\nD. Olmsted, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 084502 (2004)], we here explore possibilities\nto manipulate the dynamical behaviour via closed-loop (feedback) control\ninvolving a time delay $\\tau$. The model considered relates the viscoelastic\nstress of the system to a structural variable, that is, the length of the\nmicelles, yielding two time- and space-dependent dynamical variables $\\xi_1$,\n$\\xi_2$. As a starting point we perform a systematic linear stability analysis\nof the uncontrolled system for (i) an externally imposed average shear rate and\n(ii) an imposed total stress, and compare the results to those from extensive\nnumerical simulations. We then apply the so-called Pyragas feedback scheme\nwhere the equations of motion are supplemented by a control term of the form\n$K\\left(a(t)-a(t-\\tau)\\right)$ with $a$ being a measurable quantity depending\non the rheological protocol. For the choice of an imposed shear rate, the\nPyragas scheme for the total stress reduces to a non-diagonal scheme\nconcentrating on the viscoelastic stress. Focusing on parameters close to a\nHopf bifurcation, where the uncontrolled system displays oscillatory states as\nwell as hysteresis in the shear rate controlled protocol, we demonstrate that\n(local) Pyragas control leads to a full stabilization to the steady state\nsolution of the total stress, while a global control scheme does not work. In\ncontrast, for the case of imposed total stress, global Pyragas control fully\nstabilizes the system. In both cases, the control does not change the space of\nsolutions, rather it selects the steady state solutions out of the existing\nsolutions. This underlines the non-invasive character of the Pyragas scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 13:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 11:43:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 18:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 10:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Since the collision velocities of dust particles\nare regulated by turbulence in a protoplanetary disk, the turbulent clustering\nshould be properly treated. To that end, direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of\nthe Navier Stokes equations are requisite. In a series of papers, Pan & Padoan\nused a DNS with the Reynolds number Re~1000. Here, we perform DNSs with up to\nRe=16100, which allow us to track the motion of particles with Stokes numbers\nof 0.01<~St<~0.2 in the inertial range. By the DNSs, we confirm that the rms\nrelative velocity of particle pairs is smaller by more than a factor of two,\ncompared to those by Ormel & Cuzzi (2007). The distributions of the radial\nrelative velocities are highly non-Gaussian. The results are almost consistent\nwith those by Pan & Padoan or Pan et al. at low-Re. Also, we find that the\nsticking rates for equal-sized particles are much higher than those for\ndifferent-sized particles. Even in the strong-turbulence case with\nalpha-viscosity of 10^{-2}, the sticking rates are as high as >~50% and the\nbouncing probabilities are as low as ~10% for equal-sized particles of\nSt<~0.01. Thus, the turbulent clustering plays a significant role for the\ngrowth of cm-sized compact aggregates (pebbles) and also enhances the solid\nabundance, which may lead to the streaming instability in a disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 13:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

We provide a small simulation study and a\nreal data example to demonstrate the capability of the robust EL method to\nhandle unusual observations in the data. The simulation and real data results\nreveal that robust constraints are needed when heavy tailedness and/or outliers\nare possible in the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 14:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-29"}

Similarly to the Primakoff-effect for axions, ALPs can mix with photons\nand consequently be searched for in laboratory experiments and with\nastrophysical observations. Here, we search for energy-dependent modulations of\nhigh-energy gamma-ray spectra that are tell-tale signatures of photon-ALPs\nmixing. To this end, we analyze the data recorded with the Fermi -LAT from\nGalactic pulsars selected to have a line of sight crossing spiral arms at a\nlarge pitch angle. The large-scale Galactic magnetic field traces the shape of\nspiral arms, such that a sizable photon-ALP conversion probability is expected\nfor the sources considered. In nine years of Fermi -LAT data, we detect\nsignificant spectral features in the selected source-sample consistent with\nphoton-ALPs oscillation with a combined statistical significance of 5.52\n{\\sigma} . Notably, sources with neighboring lines of sight share similar\nspectral features.

There are many diseases, such as norovirus and influenza, where some\ninfected hosts show symptoms of the disease while others are asymptomatically\ninfected, i.e. do not show any symptoms. The current paper considers a class of\nepidemic models following an SEIR (Susceptible $\\to$ Exposed $\\to$ Infectious\n$\\to$ Recovered) structure that allows for both symptomatic and asymptomatic\ncases. The following question is addressed: what fraction $\\rho$ of those\nindividuals getting infected are infected by symptomatic (asymptomatic) cases?\nThis is a more complicated question than the related question for the beginning\nof the epidemic: what fraction of the expected number of secondary cases of a\ntypical newly infected individual, i.e. what fraction of the basic reproduction\nnumber $R_0$, is caused by symptomatic individuals? The latter fraction only\ndepends on the type-specific reproduction numbers, while the former fraction\n$\\rho$ also depends on timing and hence on the probabilistic distributions of\nlatent and infectious periods of the two types (not only their means). Bounds\non $\\rho$ are derived for the situation where these distributions (and even\ntheir means) are unknown.

We first introduce the notion of a symbol in semiotics from the\nhumanities, to leave the very narrow idea of symbols in symbolic AI.\nFurthermore, over the years, it became more and more clear that symbol\nemergence has to be regarded as a multifaceted problem.

By ensembling multiple models, and\nincorporating an N-gram language model and edit features via rescoring, our\nnovel method becomes the first neural approach to outperform the current\nstate-of-the-art statistical machine translation-based approach, both in terms\nof grammaticality and fluency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 14:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-29"}

Yet this universality does not naturally\ntranslate to the dynamics of these systems , hindering our progress towards a\ngeneral theoretical framework of network dynamics. The source of this\ntheoretical gap is the fact that the behavior of a complex system cannot be\nuniquely predicted from its topology, but rather depends also on the dynamic\nmechanisms of interaction between the nodes, hence systems with similar\nstructure may exhibit profoundly different dynamic behavior. To bridge this\ngap, we derive here the patterns of network information transmission, indeed,\nthe essence of a network's behavior, by offering a systematic translation of\ntopology into the actual spatio-temporal propagation of perturbative signals.\nWe predict, for an extremely broad range of nonlinear dynamic models, that the\npropagation rules condense around three highly distinctive dynamic universality\nclasses, characterized by the interplay between network paths, degree\ndistribution and the interaction dynamics. Our formalism helps us leverage the\nmajor advances in the mapping of real world networks, into predictions on the\nactual dynamic propagation, from the spread of viruses in social networks to\nthe discussion of genetic information in cellular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-29"}

However, the time scales and system\nsizes accessible to QMD are typically limited to picoseconds and a few hundred\natoms. These constraints arise due to expensive self-consistent ground-state\nelectronic structure calculations that can often scale cubically with the\nnumber of atoms. Linearly scaling methods depend on computing the density\nmatrix P from the Hamiltonian matrix H by exploiting the sparsity in both\nmatrices. The second-order spectral projection (SP2) algorithm is an O(N)\nalgorithm that computes P with a sequence of 40-50 matrix-matrix\nmultiplications. In this paper, we present task-based implementations of a\nrecently developed data-parallel graph-based approach to the SP2 algorithm,\nG-SP2. We represent the density matrix P as an undirected graph and use graph\npartitioning techniques to divide the computation into smaller independent\ntasks. The partitions thus obtained are generally not of equal size and give\nrise to undesirable load imbalances in standard MPI-based implementations. This\nload-balancing challenge can be mitigated by dynamically scheduling parallel\ncomputations at runtime using task-based programming models. We develop\ntask-based implementations of the data-parallel G-SP2 algorithm using both\nIntel's Concurrent Collections (CnC) as well as the Charm++ programming model\nand evaluate these implementations for future use.

Besides, we\nalso discover that the resonance interatomic energy in the cosmic string\nspacetime exhibits some peculiar properties, making it in principle possible to\nsense different cosmic string spacetimes via the resonance interatomic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:14:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 14:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-15"}

We propose a novel adaptive convolution method\nthat learns the upsampling algorithm based on the local context at each\nlocation to address this problem. We modify a baseline GANs architecture by\nreplacing normal convolutions with adaptive convolutions in the generator.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10 dataset show that our modified models improve the\nbaseline model by a large margin.

In the United States (U.S.), such infants frequently are\ntransferred between hospitals. Although these neonatal transfer networks are\nimportant, both economically and for infant morbidity and mortality, the\nnational-level pattern of neonatal transfers is largely unknown. Using data\nfrom Vermont Oxford Network on 44,753 births, 2,122 hospitals, and 9,722\ninter-hospital infant transfers from 2015, we performed the largest analysis to\ndate on the inter-hospital transfer network for VLBW infants in the U.S. We\nfind that transfers are organized around regional communities, but that despite\nbeing largely within state boundaries, most communities often contain at least\ntwo hospitals in different states. To classify the structural variation in\ntransfer pattern amongst these communities, we applied a spectral measure for\nregionalization and found an association between a community's degree of\nregionalization and their infant transfer rate, which was not utilized in\ndetecting communities. We also demonstrate that the established measures of\nnetwork centrality and hierarchy, e.g., the community-wide entropy in PageRank\nor betweenness centrality and number of distinct `layers' within a community,\ncorrelate weakly with our regionalization index and were not significantly\nassociated with metrics on infant transfer rate. Our results suggest that the\nregionalization index captures novel information about the structural\nproperties of VLBW infant transfer networks, have the practical implication of\ncharacterizing neonatal care in the U.S., and may apply more broadly to the\nrole of centralizing forces in organizing complex adaptive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 12:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 17:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}
