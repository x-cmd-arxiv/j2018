While the\ntechnology of nanolasers is steadily being deployed, their expected performance\nfor on-chip optical interconnects is still largely unknown due to a limited\nunderstanding of some of their key features. Specifically, as the cavity size\nis reduced with respect to the emission wavelength, the stimulated and the\nspontaneous emission rates are modified, which is known as the Purcell effect\nin the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. This effect is expected to\nhave a major impact in the 'threshold-less' behavior of nanolasers and in their\nmodulation speed, but its role is poorly understood in practical laser\nstructures, characterized by significant homogeneous and inhomogeneous\nbroadening and by a complex spatial distribution of the active material and\ncavity field. In this work, we investigate the role of Purcell effect in the\nstimulated and spontaneous emission rates of semiconductor lasers taking into\naccount the carriers' spatial distribution in the volume of the active region\nover a wide range of cavity dimensions and emitter/cavity linewidths, enabling\nthe detailed modeling of the static and dynamic characteristics of either\nmicro- or nano-scale lasers using single-mode rate-equations analysis. The\nultimate limits of scaling down these nanoscale light sources in terms of\nPurcell enhancement and modulation speed are also discussed showing that the\nultrafast modulation properties predicted in nanolasers are a direct\nconsequence of the enhancement of the stimulated emission rate via reduction of\nthe mode volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 16:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Correlated Components Analysis (CorrCA) addresses this problem by\nidentifying components that are maximally correlated between repetitions (e.g.\ntrials, subjects, raters).

The presence of\nthese molecules in the gas phase may result from thermal desorption of\ninterstellar ices. The aim of this work is to determine the values of the\ndesorption energies of formamide and methylamine from analogues of interstellar\ndust grain surfaces and to understand their interaction with water ice. TPD\nexperiments of formamide and methylamine ices were performed in the\nsubmonolayer and monolayer regimes on graphite (HOPG) and non-porous amorphous\nsolid water ice surfaces at 40-240 K. The desorption energy distributions of\nthese two molecules were calculated from TPD measurements using a set of\nindependent Polanyi-Wigner equations. The maximum of the desorption of\nformamide from both graphite and ASW ice surfaces occurs at 176 K after the\ndesorption of H2O molecules, whereas the desorption profile of methylamine\ndepends strongly on the substrate. Solid methylamine starts to desorb below 100\nK from the graphite surface. Its desorption from the water ice surface occurs\nafter 120 K and stops during the water ice sublimation around 150 K. It\ncontinues to desorb from the graphite surface at temperatures higher than 160\nK. More than 95 % of NH2CHO diffuses through the water ice surface towards the\ngraphitic substrate and is released into the gas phase with a desorption energy\ndistribution (7460-9380 K), which is measured with the best-fit pre-exponential\nfactor A=10^18 s-1. However, the desorption energy distribution of methylamine\nfrom the np-ASW ice surface (3850-8420 K) is measured with the best-fit\npre-exponential factor A=10^12 s-1. A fraction of solid methylamine monolayer\nof roughly 0.15 diffuses through the water ice surface towards the HOPG\nsubstrate. This small amount desorbs later with higher binding energies\n(5050-8420 K).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 16:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

In recent years, experiments and ab initio\nsimulations have identified dilithium ethylene dicarbonate (Li2EDC) as the\ndominant component of SEI layers. Here, we adopt a parameterized,\nnon-polarizable MD force field for Li2EDC to study transport characteristics of\nLi+ in this model SEI layer at moderate temperatures. The observed correlations\nare consistent with recent MD results using a polarizable force field,\nsuggesting that this non-polarizable model is effective for our purposes of\ninvestigating Li+ dynamics over long time scales. Mean-squared displacements\ndistinguish three distinct Li+ transport regimes in EDC ballistic, trapping,\nand diffusive.

New materials developed for fast-charging Li-ion batteries should\nhave smaller trapping regions. The analyses implemented in this paper can be\nused for testing transport of Li+ ion in novel battery materials. Non-Gaussian\nfeatures of van Hove self -correlation functions for Li+ in EDC, along with the\nmean-squared displacements, are consistent in describing EDC as a glassy\nmaterial compared with liquid EC.

This has resulted in its practical use for either primary detection\nengines or for supplementary heuristic detection by anti-malware vendors.\nRecent work in adversarial machine learning has shown that deep learning models\nare susceptible to gradient-based attacks, whereas non-differentiable models\nthat report a score can be attacked by genetic algorithms that aim to\nsystematically reduce the score. We propose a more general framework based on\nreinforcement learning (RL) for attacking static portable executable (PE)\nanti-malware engines. The general framework does not require a differentiable\nmodel nor does it require the engine to produce a score. Instead, an RL agent\nis equipped with a set of functionality-preserving operations that it may\nperform on the PE file. Through a series of games played against the\nanti-malware engine, it learns which sequences of operations are likely to\nresult in evading the detector for any given malware sample. This enables\ncompletely black-box attacks against static PE anti-malware, and produces\nfunctional evasive malware samples as a direct result. We show in experiments\nthat our method can attack a gradient-boosted machine learning model with\nevasion rates that are substantial and appear to be strongly dependent on the\ndataset.

The answer to this question would\nhelp explain the origin of micro-Gauss strength magnetic fields observed in\ngalaxies. It is also of fundamental importance in developing a complete theory\nof the early universe. While there can be other signatures of cosmological\nmagnetic fields, a signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) would\nprove their primordial origin. The B-mode polarization of CMB is particularly\npromising in this regard because there are relatively few other sources of\nB-modes, and because the vortical modes sourced by the primordial magnetic\nfield (PMF) survive diffusion damping up to a small fraction of the Silk\nlength. At present, the Planck temperature and polarization spectra combined\nwith the B-mode spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) constrain\nthe PMF strength to be no more than $\\sim 1$ nano-Gauss (nG). Because of the\nquartic scaling of the CMB anisotropy spectra with the PMF strength, this bound\nwill not change by much even with the significantly better measurements of the\nB-mode spectrum by the Stage III and Stage IV CMB experiments. On the other\nhand, tightening the bound well below the $1$ nG threshold would rule out the\npurely primordial origin (requiring no dynamo action) of galactic fields.\nConsidering Faraday rotation, which converts some of the E-modes into B-modes\nand scales linearly with the field strength, will help to achieve this goal. As\nwe demonstrate, the upcoming experiments, such as SPT-3G and the Simons\nObservatory, will be sensitive to fields of $\\sim 0.5$ nG strength thanks to\nthe mode-coupling signature induced by Faraday rotation. A future Stage IV\nground based experiment or a Space Probe will be capable of probing fields\nbelow $0.1$ nG, and would detect a scale-invariant PMF of $0.2$ nG strength\nwithout de-lensing or subtracting the galactic rotation measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 18:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 19:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

The continuously growing \\cmb data sets render the \\cmb\nmap-making problem more challenging in terms of computational cost and memory\nin particular in the context of ground based experiments. In this context, we\nstudy a novel class of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) solvers\nwhich invoke two-level preconditioners. We compare them against PCG solvers\ncommonly used in the map-making context considering their precision and\ntime-to-solution. We compare these new methods on realistic, simulated data\nsets reflecting the characteristics of current and forthcoming \\cmb\nground-based experiment. We develop an embarrassingly parallel implementation\nof the approach where each processor performs a sequential map-making for a\nsubset of the TOD. We find that considering the map level residuals the new\nclass of solvers permits achieving tolerance of up to 3 orders of magnitude\nbetter than the standard approach, where the residual level often saturates\nbefore convergence is reached. This corresponds to an important improvement in\nthe precision of recovered power spectra in particular on the largest angular\nscales. The new method also typically requires fewer iterations to reach a\nrequired precision and thus shorter runtimes for a single map-making solution.\nHowever, the construction of an appropriate two-level preconditioner can be as\ncostly as a single standard map-making run. Nevertheless, if the same problem\nneeds to be solved multiple times, e.g., as in Monte Carlo simulations, this\ncost has to be incurred only once, and the method should be competitive not\nonly as far as its precision but also its performance is concerned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 18:59:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 18:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

In addition, a novel derivation\nof the standard effective-range function is presented from the analysis of\nCoulomb wave functions in the complex plane of the energy. The recently\nproposed effective-range function denoted as $\\Delta_\\ell$ [Phys. Rev. C 96,\n034601 (2017)] and an earlier variant [Hamilton et al., Nucl. Phys.

The potential interest of\n$\\Delta_\\ell$ for the study of low-energy cross sections and weakly bound\nstates is discussed in the framework of the proton-proton ${}^1S_0$ collision.\nThe resonant state of the proton-proton collision is successfully computed from\nthe extrapolation of $\\Delta_\\ell$ instead of the standard function. It is\nshown that interpolating $\\Delta_\\ell$ can lead to useful extrapolation to\nnegative energies, provided scattering data are known below one nuclear Rydberg\nenergy (12.5 keV for the proton-proton system).

Here, we aim at\nstudying the magnetic nature of umbra-penumbra boundaries in sunspots of\ndifferent sizes, morphologies, evolutionary stages, and phases of the solar\ncycle. We used a sample of 88 scans of the Hinode/SOT spectropolarimeter to\ninfer the magnetic field properties in at the umbral boundaries. We defined\nthese umbra-penumbra boundaries by an intensity threshold and performed a\nstatistical analysis of the magnetic field properties on these boundaries. We\nstatistically prove that the umbra-penumbra boundary in stable sunspots is\ncharacterised by an invariant value of the vertical magnetic field component:\nthe vertical component of the magnetic field strength does not depend on the\numbra size, its morphology, and phase of the solar cycle. With the statistical\nBayesian inference, we find that the strength of the vertical magnetic field\ncomponent is, with a likelihood of 99\\%, in the range of 1849-1885 G with the\nmost probable value of 1867 G. In contrast, the magnetic field strength and\ninclination averaged along individual boundaries are found to be dependent on\nthe umbral size: the larger the umbra, the stronger and more horizontal the\nmagnetic field at its boundary. The umbra and penumbra of sunspots are\nseparated by a boundary that has hitherto been defined by an intensity\nthreshold. We now unveil the empirical law of the magnetic nature of the\numbra-penumbra boundary in stable sunspots: it is an invariant vertical\ncomponent of the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 21:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

When does a variable provide unique\ninformation, when do variables share redundant information, and when do\nvariables combine synergistically to provide complementary information? The\nredundancy lattice from the partial information decomposition of Williams and\nBeer provided a promising glimpse at the answer to these questions. However,\nthis structure was constructed using a much criticised measure of redundant\ninformation, and despite sustained research, no completely satisfactory\nreplacement measure has been proposed. In this paper, we take a different\napproach, applying the axiomatic derivation of the redundancy lattice to a\nsingle realisation from a set of discrete variables. To overcome the difficulty\nassociated with signed pointwise mutual information, we apply this\ndecomposition separately to the unsigned entropic components of pointwise\nmutual information which we refer to as the specificity and ambiguity. This\nyields a separate redundancy lattice for each component. Then based upon an\noperational interpretation of redundancy, we define measures of redundant\nspecificity and ambiguity enabling us to evaluate the partial information atoms\nin each lattice. These atoms can be recombined to yield the sought-after\nmultivariate information decomposition. We apply this framework to canonical\nexamples from the literature and discuss the results and the various properties\nof the decomposition. In particular, the pointwise decomposition using\nspecificity and ambiguity satisfies a chain rule over target variables, which\nprovides new insights into the so-called two-bit-copy example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 00:26:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 01:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 05:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

Simplicity, robustness, and suitability for\nreal-time systems are the salient features of the CAN bus protocol.

Physical signal\nattributes of the received packet consisting of channel and node (or device)\nwhich contains specific unique artifacts are considered to achieve this goal.\nMaterial and design imperfections in the physical channel and digital device,\nwhich are the main contributing factors behind the device-channel specific\nunique artifacts, are leveraged to link the received electrical signal to the\ntransmitter.

Performance of the proposed fingerprinting method is\nevaluated by using a dataset collected from 16 different channels and four\nidentical ECUs transmitting same message.

As in the model\nrecently introduced by Polyanskiy for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a\nfixed, known number of transmitters, the channel is assumed to be invariant to\npermutations on its inputs, and all active transmitters employ identical\nencoders. Unlike the Polyanskiy model, in the proposed scenario, neither the\ntransmitters nor the receiver knows which transmitters are active. We refer to\nthis agnostic communication setup as the Random Access Channel (RAC). Scheduled\nfeedback of a finite number of bits is used to synchronize the transmitters.\nThe decoder is tasked with determining from the channel output the number of\nactive transmitters, $k$, and their messages but not which transmitter sent\nwhich message. The decoding procedure occurs at a time $n_t$ depending on the\ndecoder's estimate, $t$, of the number of active transmitters, $k$, thereby\nachieving a rate that varies with the number of active transmitters. Single-bit\nfeedback at each time $n_i, i \\leq t$, enables all transmitters to determine\nthe end of one coding epoch and the start of the next. The central result of\nthis work demonstrates the achievability on a RAC of performance that is\nfirst-order optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch. While\nprior multiple access schemes for a fixed number of transmitters require $2^k -\n1$ simultaneous threshold rules, the proposed scheme uses a single threshold\nrule and achieves the same dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 01:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 02:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 03:33:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:26:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 23:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

Guesswork is\ncentral to several applications in information theory: Average guesswork\nprovides a lower bound on the expected computational cost of a sequential\ndecoder to decode successfully the transmitted message; the complementary\ncumulative distribution function of guesswork gives the error probability in\nlist decoding; the logarithm of guesswork is the number of bits needed in\noptimal lossless one-to-one source coding; and guesswork is the number of\ntrials required of an adversary to breach a password protected system in a\nbrute-force attack. In this paper, we consider memoryless string-sources that\ngenerate strings consisting of i.i.d. characters drawn from a finite alphabet,\nand characterize their corresponding guesswork. Our main tool is the tilt\noperation. We show that the tilt operation on a memoryless string-source\nparametrizes an exponential family of memoryless string-sources, which we refer\nto as the tilted family. We provide an operational meaning to the tilted\nfamilies by proving that two memoryless string-sources result in the same\nguesswork on all strings of all lengths if and only if their respective\ncategorical distributions belong to the same tilted family. Establishing some\ngeneral properties of the tilt operation, we generalize the notions of weakly\ntypical set and asymptotic equipartition property to tilted weakly typical sets\nof different orders. We use this new definition to characterize the large\ndeviations for all atypical strings and characterize the volume of weakly\ntypical sets of different orders. We subsequently build on this\ncharacterization to prove large deviation bounds on guesswork and provide an\naccurate approximation of its PMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 01:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 03:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

Most existing approaches\nadopt the pipeline of representing an image via pre-trained CNNs, and then\nusing the uninterpretable CNN features in conjunction with the question to\npredict the answer. Although such end-to-end models might report promising\nperformance, they rarely provide any insight, apart from the answer, into the\nVQA process. In this work, we propose to break up the end-to-end VQA into two\nsteps: explaining and reasoning, in an attempt towards a more explainable VQA\nby shedding light on the intermediate results between these two steps. To that\nend, we first extract attributes and generate descriptions as explanations for\nan image using pre-trained attribute detectors and image captioning models,\nrespectively. Next, a reasoning module utilizes these explanations in place of\nthe image to infer an answer to the question. The advantages of such a\nbreakdown include: (1) the attributes and captions can reflect what the system\nextracts from the image, thus can provide some explanations for the predicted\nanswer; (2) these intermediate results can help us identify the inabilities of\nboth the image understanding part and the answer inference part when the\npredicted answer is wrong. We conduct extensive experiments on a popular VQA\ndataset and dissect all results according to several measurements of the\nexplanation quality.

Here we test two types of orthogonal ECCs\non seven different datasets using three types of binary classifier and compare\nthem with three other multi-class methods: 1 vs. 1, one-versus-the-rest and\nrandom ECCs. The first type of orthogonal ECC, in which the codes contain no\nzeros, admits a fast and simple method of solving for the probabilities.\nOrthogonal ECCs are always more accurate than random ECCs as predicted by\nrecent literature. Improvments in uncertainty coefficient (U.C.) range between\n0.4--17.5% (0.004--0.139, absolute), while improvements in Brier score between\n0.7--10.7%. Unfortunately, orthogonal ECCs are rarely more accurate than 1 vs.\n1. Disparities are worst when the methods are paired with logistic regression,\nwith orthogonal ECCs never beating 1 vs. 1. When the methods are paired with\nSVM, the losses are less significant, peaking at 1.5%, relative, 0.011 absolute\nin uncertainty coefficient and 6.5% in Brier scores. Orthogonal ECCs are always\nthe fastest of the five multi-class methods when paired with linear\nclassifiers. When paired with a piecewise linear classifier, whose\nclassification speed does not depend on the number of training samples,\nclassifications using orthogonal ECCs were always more accurate than the other\nmethods and also faster than 1 vs. 1.

In this paper, we propose a unified object\nrepresentation built from a hierarchy of pose-aligned regions. Rather than\nrepresenting an object by regions aligned to image axes, the proposed\nrepresentation characterizes appearance relative to the object's pose using\npose-aligned patches whose features are robust to variations in pose, scale and\nrotation. We propose an algorithm that performs pose estimation and forms the\nunified object representation as the concatenation of hierarchical pose-aligned\nregions features, which is then fed into a classification network.

In this paper, the\noptimal tradeoff among the message rates and the server broadcast rates, which\nis defined formally as the capacity region, is studied for a general\ndistributed index coding problem. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region\nare established that have matching sum-rates for all 218 non-isomorphic\nfour-message problems with equal link capacities for all the links from servers\nto receivers. The proposed inner bound is built on a distributed composite\ncoding scheme that outperforms the existing schemes by incorporating more\nflexible decoding configurations and enhanced fractional rate allocations into\ntwo-stage composite coding, a scheme that was originally introduced for\ncentralized index coding. The proposed outer bound is built on the\npolymatroidal axioms of entropy, as well as functional dependences such as the\n$\\rm{fd}$-separation introduced by the multi-server nature of the problem. This\nouter bound utilizes general groupings of servers with different levels of\ngranularity, which allows a natural tradeoff between computational complexity\nand tightness of the bound, and includes and improves upon all existing outer\nbounds for distributed index coding.

A main category of\nnon-gravitational forces to be considered are those of thermal origin, whose\nfine modeling strongly depends on the knowledge of the evolution of the spin\nvector. We present a complete model, named LASSOS, to describe the evolution of\nthe spin of the LAGEOS and LARES satellites.

The utilized capacitor electrodes are thus\nbetter to have large surface areas, high conductivity, high stability, and\nimportantly be of binder free. Herein, vertically aligned carbon nanofibers\n(CNFs) coated boron-doped diamonds (BDD) are employed as the capacitor\nelectrodes to construct battery-like supercapacitors. Grown via a thermal\nchemical vapor deposition technique, these CNFs/BDD hybrid films are binder\nfree and own porous structures, resulting in large surface areas. Meanwhile,\nthe containment of graphene layers and copper metal catalysts inside CNFs/BDD\nleads to their high conductivity. Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and\npseudocapacitors (PCs) are then constructed in the inert electrolyte (1.0 M\nH2SO4 solution) and in the redox-active electrolyte (1.0 M Na2SO4 + 0.05 M\nFe(CN)63-/4-), respectively. For assembled two-electrode symmetrical\nsupercapacitor devices, the capacitances of EDLC and PC devices reach 30 and 48\nmF cm-2 at 10 mV s-1, respectively. They remain constant even after 10 000\ncycles. The power densities are 27.3 kW kg-1 and 25.3 kW kg-1 for EDLC and PC\ndevices, together with their energy densities of 22.9 Wh kg-1 and 44.1 Wh kg-1,\nrespectively. The performance of formed EDLC and PC devices is comparable to\nmarket-available batteries. Therefore, the vertically aligned CNFs/BDD hybrid\nfilm is a suitable capacitor electrode material to construct high-performance\nbattery-like and industry-orientated supercapacitors for flexible power\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 17:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

We propose and theoretically show that\nintroducing prosocial incentives in the competitive environment is effective\nand robust to public observability since (i) it induces women who are\nintrinsically motivated by prosocial incentives to the competitive environment\nand (ii) it makes participating in a competition not costly for women from\nsocial image point of view.

It is found\nthat the defect BM is hard to form in MX2 due to the large formation energy\noriginating from the crystal distortion, while AlM is easy to realize compared\nto the former. In MoS2, WS2 and MoTe2, Al is the most desirable p-type dopant\nunder anion-rich conditions among the group III components, since AlM has\nrelatively low transition and formation energies. With respect to the doping of\nthe group V elements, it is found that the substitutions on the cation sites\nhave deeper defect levels than those on the anion sites due to the strong\nelectronegativity. AsTe and SbTe in MoTe2 and WTe2 are trend to form shallow\nacceptors under cation-rich conditions, indicating high hole-concentrations for\np-type doping, whereas SbS in MoS2 and PTe in WTe2 are shown to be good p-type\ncandidates under cation-rich conditions. In despite of that the substitutions\nof group VII on X site have low formation energies, the transition energies are\ntoo high to achieve n-type MoS2 and WS2. Nevertheless, for MoTe2, the\nsubstitutions with the group VII elements on the anion sites are suitable for\nn-type doping on account of the shallow donor levels and low formation energies\nunder Mo-rich condition.
