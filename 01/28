Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA) has been proposed to improve the system spectral efficiency (SE) of the\nfifth-generation (5G) networks by allowing concurrent transmissions of multiple\nusers in the same spectrum. As such, NOMA has been recently considered for the\nuplink of WPCNs based IoT networks with a massive number of devices. However,\nsimultaneous transmissions in NOMA may also incur more transmit energy\nconsumption as well as circuit energy consumption in practice which is critical\nfor energy constrained IoT devices. As a result, compared to orthogonal\nmultiple access schemes such as time-division multiple access (TDMA), whether\nthe SE can be improved and/or the total energy consumption can be reduced with\nNOMA in such a scenario still remains unknown. To answer this question, we\nfirst derive the optimal time allocations for maximizing the SE of a TDMA-based\nWPCN (T-WPCN) and a NOMA-based WPCN (N-WPCN), respectively. Subsequently, we\nanalyze the total energy consumption as well as the maximum SE achieved by\nthese two networks. Surprisingly, it is found that N-WPCN not only consumes\nmore energy, but also is less spectral efficient than T-WPCN. Simulation\nresults verify our theoretical findings and unveil the fundamental performance\nbottleneck, i.e., \"worst user bottleneck problem\", in multiuser NOMA systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 16:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

We\npropose a unified method for empirical non-parametric estimation of general MI\nfunction between random vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ based on $N$ i.i.d. samples.\nThe reduced complexity MI estimator, called the ensemble dependency graph\nestimator (EDGE), combines randomized locality sensitive hashing (LSH),\ndependency graphs, and ensemble bias-reduction methods. We prove that EDGE\nachieves optimal computational complexity $O(N)$, and can achieve the optimal\nparametric MSE rate of $O(1/N)$ if the density is $d$ times differentiable. To\nthe best of our knowledge EDGE is the first non-parametric MI estimator that\ncan achieve parametric MSE rates with linear time complexity. We illustrate the\nutility of EDGE for the analysis of the information plane (IP) in deep\nlearning.

The\nmost common sparse dictionary learning algorithms use the techniques of\nmatching pursuit and K-SVD iteratively for sparse coding and dictionary\nlearning respectively. While this technique produces good results, it requires\na large number of iterations to converge to an optimal solution. In this\narticle, we use a closed form stabilized convex optimization technique for both\nsparse coding and dictionary learning.

The motion of tectonic\nplates, volcanism, mountain building and the reshaping of our planet's surface\nover geologic time depend on the Earth's internal energy. Tectonic activity is\ndriven by internal energy and affects the rate at which energy is tapped, i.e.,\nthe cooling rate of our planet. Petrologic data indicate that cooling did not\noccur at a constant rate over geologic history. Interior cooling was mild until\n~2.5 billion years ago and then increased (Figure 1). As the Earth cools, it\ncycles water between its rocky interior (crust and mantle) and its surface.\nWater affects the viscosity of mantle rock, which affects the pace of tectonics\nand, by association, Earth cooling. We present suites of thermal-tectonic\nhistory models, coupled to deep water cycling, to show that the petrologically\nconstrained change in the Earth's cooling rate can be accounted for by\nvariations in deep water cycling over geologic time. The change in cooling rate\ndoes not require a change in the global tectonic mode of the Earth. It can be\naccounted for by a change in the balance of water cycling between the Earth's\ninterior and its surface envelopes. The nature and timing of that water cycling\nchange can be correlated to a change in the nature of continental crust and an\nassociated rise of atmospheric oxygen. The prediction that the rise of oxygen\nshould then be correlated, in time, to the change in the Earth's cooling rate\nis consistent with data constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 23:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

The definition of total dual integrality (TDI) revolves\naround the existence of optimal dual solutions that are integral, and thus\nnaturally applies to a host of combinatorial optimization problems that are\ncast as integer programs whose LP relaxations have the TDIness property.\nHowever, when combinatorial problems are formulated using more general convex\nrelaxations, such as semidefinite programs (SDPs), it is not at all clear what\nan appropriate notion of integrality in the dual program is, thus inhibiting\nthe generalization of the theory to more general forms of structured convex\noptimization. (In fact, we argue that the rank-one constraint usually added to\nSDP relaxations is not adequate in the dual SDP.)\n  In this paper, we propose a notion of total dual integrality for SDPs that\ngeneralizes the notion for LPs, by relying on an \"integrality constraint\" for\nSDPs that is primal-dual symmetric. A key ingredient for the theory is a\ngeneralization to compact convex sets of a result of Hoffman for polytopes,\nfundamental for generalizing the polyhedral notion of total dual integrality\nintroduced by Edmonds and Giles. We study the corresponding theory applied to\nSDP formulations for stable sets in graphs using the Lov\\'asz theta function\nand show that total dual integrality in this case corresponds to the underlying\ngraph being perfect. We also relate dual integrality of an SDP formulation for\nthe maximum cut problem to bipartite graphs. Total dual integrality for\nextended formulations naturally comes into play in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 00:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

This\nallows us to construct GPGs as compact representations of bottom-up procedure\nsummaries in terms of memory updates and control flow between them. Their\ncompactness is ensured by the following optimizations: strength reduction\nreduces the indirection levels, redundancy elimination removes redundant memory\nupdates and minimizes control flow (without over-approximating data dependence\nbetween memory updates), and call inlining enhances the opportunities of these\noptimizations. We devise novel operations and data flow analyses for these\noptimizations.\n  Our quest for scalability of points-to analysis leads to the following\ninsight: The real killer of scalability in program analysis is not the amount\nof data but the amount of control flow that it may be subjected to in search of\nprecision. The effectiveness of GPGs lies in the fact that they discard as much\ncontrol flow as possible without losing precision (i.e., by preserving data\ndependence without over-approximation). This is the reason why the GPGs are\nvery small even for main procedures that contain the effect of the entire\nprogram.

The interaction of atoms with light leads to entanglement of electron\nand photon states (dressing of the atoms). The driving via dc field leads to\nthe Bloch oscillations (BO) in the chain of dressed atoms. We considered the\nmutual influence of dressing and BO and show that scenario of oscillations\ndramatically differs from predicted by the Jaynes-Cummings and Bloch-Zener\nmodels. We study the evolution of the population inversion, tunneling current,\nphoton probability distribution, mean number of photons, photon number variance\nand show the influence of BO on the quantum-statistical characteristics of\nlight.

To this end, a\nunified computation-centric metric is an essential requirement. As the most\nimportant computation-centric performance metric, FLOPS has guided computing\nsystems evolutions for many years. However, our observations demonstrate that\nthe average FLOPS efficiency of the DC workloads is only 0.1%, which implies\nthat FLOPS is inappropriate for DC computing. To address the above issue, we\npropose BOPS (Basic Operations Per Second), which is the average number of BOPs\n(Basic OPerations) completed per second. We conduct the analysis on the\ncharacteristics of seventeen typical DC workloads and extract the minimum\nrepresentative computation operations set, which is composed of integer and\nfloating point computation operations of arithmetic, comparing and array\naddressing.

In this paper, source\nlocalization from EEG using independent component analysis (ICA) and dipole\nfitting has been applied first, followed by selecting those dipoles that are\nclosest to the active regions identified with fMRI. This allows translating the\nhigh temporal resolution of EEG to estimate time varying connectivity at the\nspatial source level. Our analysis shows that the estimated functional\nconnectivity between two active regions can be correlated with the physical\nproperties of the structure obtained from DTI analysis. This constitutes a\nfirst step towards opening the possibility of using pervasive EEG to monitor\nthe long-term impact of ASD treatment without the need for frequent expensive\nfMRI or DTI investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 14:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

However, 3D facial landmark localization in a single image is\nchallenging due to the ambiguous nature of landmarks under 3D perspective.\nExisting approaches typically adopt a suboptimal two-step strategy, performing\n2D landmark localization followed by depth estimation. In this paper, we\npropose the Joint Voxel and Coordinate Regression (JVCR) method for 3D facial\nlandmark localization, addressing it more effectively in an end-to-end fashion.\nFirst, a compact volumetric representation is proposed to encode the per-voxel\nlikelihood of positions being the 3D landmarks. The dimensionality of such a\nrepresentation is fixed regardless of the number of target landmarks, so that\nthe curse of dimensionality could be avoided. Then, a stacked hourglass network\nis adopted to estimate the volumetric representation from coarse to fine,\nfollowed by a 3D convolution network that takes the estimated volume as input\nand regresses 3D coordinates of the face shape. In this way, the 3D structural\nconstraints between landmarks could be learned by the neural network in a more\nefficient manner. Moreover, the proposed pipeline enables end-to-end training\nand improves the robustness and accuracy of 3D facial landmark localization.\nThe effectiveness of our approach is validated on the 3DFAW and AFLW2000-3D\ndatasets.

Being relatively\nintricate devices, and often exhibiting intense parameter variation, this type\nof electronic devices has motivated much research interest especially regarding\ntheir characterization and modeling. In this work, we apply a recently reported\nmodeling methodology, based on the Early effect, for characterizing new old\nstock NPN and PNP small signal germanium junction transistors and comparing\nthem to more modern silicon bipolar junction devices. The Early approach is\nspecial in the sense that its two parameters, namely the Early voltage $V_a$\nand a proportionality parameter $s$, are fixed and independent of transistor\noperation. Remarkable results are obtained, including the fact that the four\nconsidered groups, namely NPN and PNP germanium and silicon devices, occupy\nmostly non-overlapping regions in the Early parameter space, with PNP devices\npresenting larger parameter variability in both cases. Surprisingly, the\nconsidered germanium devices exhibited smaller parameter variability than\nobserved for the silicon counterparts. When mapped into the more traditional\nspace defined by the current gain and output resistance parameters, the four\ntransistor groups exhibited much larger overlaps and yielded a clustering\nstructure much less organized than allowed by the Early mapping. This result\nsuggest that the Early representation of transistors is more compatible and\ninherently related to the structure of amplifying devices such as those\nconsidered in this work. In addition, it was verified that the center of mass\nof each of the NPN-PNP pairs of germanium and silicon devices are crossed by\nrespective $\\beta$-isolines for gains of 130 and 250, respectively. Germanium\ndevices were also characterized as having smaller output resistance and smaller\nmagnitudes of Early voltage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 10:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Mice are a premier model of human\ndisease and are the model system of choice for much of basic neuroscience. High\nframe rates (250 Hz) are needed to quantify the kinematics of these running\nrodents. Manual tracking, especially for multiple markers, becomes\ntime-consuming and impossible. Therefore, an automated method is necessary. We\npropose a method to track the paws of the animal in the following manner:\nfirst, segmenting all the possible paws based on color; second, classifying the\nsegmented objects using a support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN);\nthird, classifying the objects using the kinematic features of the running\nanimal, coupled with texture features from earlier frames; and finally,\ndetecting and handling collisions to assure the correctness of labelled paws.\nThe proposed method is validated in sixty 1,000 frame video sequences (4\nseconds) captured by four cameras from five mice. The total sensitivity for\ntracking of the front and hind paw is 99.70% using the SVM classifier and\n99.76% using the NN classifier. In addition, we show the feasibility of 3D\nreconstruction using the four camera system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 16:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

Compared to the\nprevious exploration with sinusoidal type transcendental nonlinearity, here we\nfocus on only cross-product and higher-power type nonlinearities in the three\nstate equations.

The expressions of these new\nLorenz-like nonlinear dynamical systems have been automatically evolved through\nmulti-gene genetic programming (MGGP). In the past two decades, there have been\nmany claims of designing new chaotic attractors as an incremental extension of\nthe Lorenz family. We provide here a large family of chaotic systems whose\nstructure closely resemble the original Lorenz system but with drastically\ndifferent phase space dynamics.
