First, we obtain new\nbounds for the local smoothness via the Blumenthal-Getoor indices of the L\\'evy\nwhite noise. We also deduce the critical local smoothness when the two indices\ncoincide, which is true for symmetric-alpha-stable, compound Poisson, and\nsymmetric-gamma white noises to name a few. Second, we express the critical\nasymptotic growth rate in terms of the moment properties of the L\\'evy white\nnoise. Previous analyses only provided lower bounds for both the local\nsmoothness and the asymptotic growth rate. Showing the sharpness of these\nbounds requires us to determine in which Besov spaces a given L\\'evy white\nnoise is (almost surely) not. Our methods are based on the wavelet-domain\ncharacterization of Besov spaces and precise moment estimates for the wavelet\ncoefficients of the L\\'evy white noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 16:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 23:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 15:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

Our model operates on a\nmulti-hierarchical paradigm and is based on the intuition that not all reviews\nare created equal, i.e., only a select few are important. The importance,\nhowever, should be dynamically inferred depending on the current target. To\nthis end, we propose a review-by-review pointer-based learning scheme that\nextracts important reviews, subsequently matching them in a word-by-word\nfashion. This enables not only the most informative reviews to be utilized for\nprediction but also a deeper word-level interaction. Our pointer-based method\noperates with a novel gumbel-softmax based pointer mechanism that enables the\nincorporation of discrete vectors within differentiable neural architectures.\nOur pointer mechanism is co-attentive in nature, learning pointers which are\nco-dependent on user-item relationships.

In this work, experiment and theory\nare used to show that they are network liquids---dynamic macromolecules that\nappear elastic on short timescales but exhibit flow on longer timescales. Each\nborosilicone is a vast covalent network of silicone polymer chains joined by\ntrifunctional boron crosslinks. At any instant, the borosilicone is a\nhighly-crosslinked elastic material. Because the boron crosslinks are\ntemporary, however, the network evolves with time and the borosilicone exhibits\nliquid behavior. A simple borosilicone exemplifies a classic transient network\nmodel and behaves as a simple (Lodge) elastic fluid. Its measured moduli and\nviscosities fit those predicted by the transient network model and the Maxwell\nviscoelastic model: a spring in series with a dashpot, including the observed\nexponential relaxation processes. When a borosilicone includes permanent\ncrosslinks, however, it no longer behaves as a simple elastic fluid. Its\nmeasured moduli and viscosities fit those predicted by the Fractional Maxwell\nviscoelastic model: a spring in series with a the spring-pot, including the\nobserved slower-than-exponential relaxation processes. Beyond the gelation\nthreshold, a borosilicone becomes a viscoelastic silicone rubber (VSR). With a\npermanent network that spans the material coupled to a temporary network that\nalso spans the material, the VSR is a network liquid piggybacking on a network\nsolid. The Fractional Zener viscoelastic model: an elastic spring in parallel\nto the Fractional Maxwell model, accurately predicts the measured moduli of\nVSRs. The temporary nature of boron crosslinks is due to exchange reactions.\nBecause the mean lifetime of temporary crosslinks is a borosilicone's only\nsignificant timescale, it exhibits thermo-rheological simplicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 17:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

Dissipation can also be caused by the retarded\nresponse to the time-dependent excitation, and in general gives insight into\nthe system's relaxation times and mechanisms. We address the dissipation in a\nmesoscopic normal wire with superconducting contacts, that sustains a\nsupercurrent at zero frequency and that may be expected to remain\ndissipationless at frequency lower than the superconducting gap. We probe the\nhigh frequency linear response of a Normal/Superconductor ring to a\ntime-dependent flux by coupling it to a highly sensitive multimode microwave\nresonator. Far from being the simple derivative of the current-phase relation,\nthe ring's ac susceptibility also displays a dissipative component whose phase\ndependence is a signature of the dynamical processes occurring within the\nAndreev spectrum. We show how dissipation is driven by the competition between\nthe two aforementioned mechanisms. Depending on the relative strength of those\ncontributions, dissipation can be maximal at $\\pi$, when the minigap closes, or\ncan be maximal near $ \\pi/2$, when the dc supercurrent is maximal. We also find\nthat the dissipative response increases at low temperature and can even exceed\nthe normal state conductance.

In the\nsimplest single-component case they form a dimensionless ratio \\kappa. As\npointed out by Ginzburg in 1952, in general the ratio depends on the direction\nof the applied magnetic field due to material anisotropies. Single component\nmaterials can therefore display type-1 superconductivity when the field is\napplied in one direction and type-2 when the field is applied in a different\ndirection. In this paper we expand the above length scale analysis to\nanisotropic multi-component superconductors, that can have multiple coherence\nlengths as well as multiple magnetic field penetration lengths, leading to\nunconvential length scale hierarchies. We demonstrate that the anisotropies in\nmulti-band superconductors cannot in general be rescaled, leading to new\nregimes with various mixed hierarchies in different directions. For example, a\nregime is possible, where for a field applied in a certain direction coherence\nlengths are smaller than the magnetic field penetration lengths in one of the\nperpendicular directions, where as the penetration lengths are lager in the\nanother direction.

Some 200 spectral features from 15 molecules (and their isotopologues)\nwere observed, including rotational lines in both the ground and vibrationally\nexcited states. Detected species include the gaseous precursors of dust grains\nsuch as SiO, AlO, AlOH, TiO, and TiO2. We present a spectral atlas for both\nstars and the parameters of all detected spectral features. A clear dichotomy\nfor the sulphur chemistry is seen: while CS, SiS, SO, and SO2 are abundantly\npresent in IK Tau, only SO and SO2 are detected in R Dor. Also other species\nsuch as NaCl, NS, AlO, and AlOH display a completely different behaviour. From\nsome selected species, the minor isotopologues can be used to assess the\nisotopic ratios. The channel maps of many species prove that both large and\nsmall-scale inhomogeneities persist in the inner wind of both stars in the form\nof blobs, arcs, and/or a disk. The high sensitivity of ALMA allows us to spot\nthe impact of these correlated density structures in the spectral line\nprofiles. The spectral lines often display a half width at zero intensity much\nlarger than expected from the terminal velocity, v_inf, previously derived for\nboth objects (36 km/s versus v_inf ~17.7 km/s for IK Tau and 23 km/s versus\nv_inf ~5.5 km/s for R Dor). Both a more complex 3D morphology and a more\nforceful wind acceleration of the (underlying) isotropic wind can explain this\ntrend. The formation of fractal grains in the region beyond ~400 mas can\npotentially account for the latter scenario. From the continuum map, we deduce\na dust mass of ~3.7e-7 Msun for IK Tau and ~2e-8 Msun for R Dor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 21:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

The consequences of giving up this assumption are investigated here. In\nparticular, hyperbolic stellar trajectories are found to be interesting. The\ntwo suggested models for the production of such trajectories will also explain\nthe observed flat rotation curves without the postulation of dark matter or\nMOND. It is suggested that spiral galaxies may have started as compact objects\nwith significant angular momenta and then disintegrated. The first model\nconjectures the existence of a spinning hot disk around a spherical galactic\ncore. The disk is held together by local gravity and electromagnetic scattering\nforces. However, it disintegrates at the edge producing fragments that form\nstars. Once separated from the disk, the stars experience only the centrally\ndirected gravitational force due to the massive core and remaining disk. A\nnumerical simulation shows that a high enough angular velocity of the disk\nproduces hyperbolic stellar trajectories that agree with the observed rotation\ncurves. The second model conjectures a significant initial thermonuclear event\nthat produces a dust plume along with large stars. This dust plume is made of\nordinary matter. However, it acts like the postulated dark matter in producing\ninitial circular trajectories. Unlike dark matter, the plume can be shown to\nescape the galaxy rapidly causing the star trajectories to evolve to hyperbolic\nshapes. This process can be seen to produce the observed rotation curves due to\nthe initial circular orbits. Also, as the plume dissipates rapidly it does not\nobfuscate the stars from view. Both models have weaknesses as do the currently\nknown models using dark matter or MOND.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 22:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

Therefore, the lifetimes of cometary dust particles (~250 thousand\nyears) are shorter than the Poynting-Robertson lifetime, and only a small\nfraction of large cometary dust particles can be transferred into orbits with\nsmall values of a.

We propose a\nnovel multi-homing CD2D (MH-CD2D) network, in which multiple homing mobile\ndevices (MMDs) act as relays for the cooperative communications of ordinary\nmobile devices (OMDs). We formulate such joint bandwidth-relay allocation\nproblem as a two-stage game, in order to deal with two challenges: how to\nmotivate MMDs to lease spare bandwidths and help OMDs to choose appropriate MMD\nrelays. In the first stage, we use a non-cooperative game to model the\ncompetition between MMDs in terms of shared bandwidth and price. In the second\nstage, we model the behavior of OMDs selecting MMDs by an evolutionary game. We\nprove that there exists Nash equilibrium in the game and propose a distributed\nincentive scheme named IMES to solve the joint bandwidth-relay allocation\nproblem.

In the\nproposed framework, an intersection coordinates the motions of CAVs based on\ntheir proposed DTOTs to let them cross the intersection efficiently while\navoiding collisions. In case when there is a collision between vehicles' DTOTs,\nthe intersection modifies conflicting DTOTs to avoid the collision and requests\nCAVs to approach and cross the intersection according to the modified DTOTs. We\nthen prove that the basic DICA is deadlock free and also starvation free. We\nalso show that the basic DICA is conservative in computational complexity and\nimprove it by several computational approaches.\n  Next, we addressed the problem of evacuating emergency vehicles as quickly as\npossible through autonomous and connected intersection traffic in this\ndissertation. The proposed intersection control algorithm Reactive DICA aims to\ndetermine an efficient vehicle-passing sequence which allows the emergency\nvehicle to cross an intersection as soon as possible while the travel times of\nother vehicles are minimally affected. When there are no emergency vehicles\nwithin the intersection area, the vehicles are controlled by DICA. When there\nare emergency vehicles entering communication range, we prioritize emergency\nvehicles through optimal ordering of vehicles. A genetic algorithm is proposed\nto solve the optimization problem which finds the optimal vehicle sequence that\ngives the emergency vehicles the highest priority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 05:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

While the CR method is widely\nrecognized as a globally convergent variant of Newton's method with superior\niteration complexity, existing results on its local quadratic convergence\nrequire a stringent non-degeneracy condition. We prove that under a local error\nbound (EB) condition, which is much weaker a requirement than the existing\nnon-degeneracy condition, the sequence of iterates generated by the CR method\nconverges at least Q-quadratically to a second-order critical point. This\nindicates that adding a cubic regularization not only equips Newton's method\nwith remarkable global convergence properties but also enables it to converge\nquadratically even in the presence of degenerate solutions. As a byproduct, we\nshow that without assuming convexity, the proposed EB condition is equivalent\nto a quadratic growth condition, which could be of independent interest. To\ndemonstrate the usefulness and relevance of our convergence analysis, we focus\non two concrete nonconvex optimization problems that arise in phase retrieval\nand low-rank matrix recovery, respectively, and prove that with overwhelming\nprobability, the sequence of iterates generated by the CR method for solving\nthese two problems converges at least Q-quadratically to a global minimizer.

The central task of face\nrecognition, including face verification and identification, involves face\nfeature discrimination. However, the traditional softmax loss of deep CNNs\nusually lacks the power of discrimination. To address this problem, recently\nseveral loss functions such as center loss, large margin softmax loss, and\nangular softmax loss have been proposed. All these improved losses share the\nsame idea: maximizing inter-class variance and minimizing intra-class variance.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely large margin cosine\nloss (LMCL), to realize this idea from a different perspective. More\nspecifically, we reformulate the softmax loss as a cosine loss by $L_2$\nnormalizing both features and weight vectors to remove radial variations, based\non which a cosine margin term is introduced to further maximize the decision\nmargin in the angular space. As a result, minimum intra-class variance and\nmaximum inter-class variance are achieved by virtue of normalization and cosine\ndecision margin maximization.

Many studies only focus on the detection of the presence or absence\nof damage. However, in a real-world scenario, when the road managers from a\ngoverning body need to repair such damage, they need to clearly understand the\ntype of damage in order to take effective action. In addition, in many of these\nprevious studies, the researchers acquire their own data using different\nmethods. Hence, there is no uniform road damage dataset available openly,\nleading to the absence of a benchmark for road damage detection. This study\nmakes three contributions to address these issues. First, to the best of our\nknowledge, for the first time, a large-scale road damage dataset is prepared.\nThis dataset is composed of 9,053 road damage images captured with a smartphone\ninstalled on a car, with 15,435 instances of road surface damage included in\nthese road images. In order to generate this dataset, we cooperated with 7\nmunicipalities in Japan and acquired road images for more than 40 hours.

Thermal driving of the jet\nitself and radiation driving by accretion disc photons produce a wide-ranging\njet solutions staring from moderately strong jets to the relativistic ones.\nInterplay of intensity and nature of radiation field and the energetics of the\njet result in such a variety in jet solutions. We show that radiation field is\nable to induce steady shocks in jets, one of the criteria to explain high\nenergy power law emission observed in spectra of some of the astrophysical\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 13:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

We study\nuniversal dynamics after a cooling quench, focusing on situations where the\ntime evolution represents a pure rescaling of spatial correlations, with time\ndefining the scale parameter. The non-equilibrium initial condition set by the\nquench induces a redistribution of particles in momentum space. Depending on\nconservation laws, this can take the form of a wave-turbulent flux or of a more\ngeneral self-similar evolution, signaling the critically slowed approach to a\nnon-thermal fixed point. We identify such fixed points using a non-perturbative\nkinetic theory of collective scattering between highly occupied long-wavelength\nmodes. In contrast, a wave-turbulent flux, possible in the perturbative\nBoltzmann regime, builds up in a critically accelerated self-similar manner. A\nkey result is the simple analytical universal scaling form of the\nnon-perturbative many-body scattering matrix, for which we lay out the concrete\nconditions under which it applies. We derive the scaling exponents for the time\nevolution as well as for the power-law tail of the momentum distribution\nfunction, for a general dynamical critical exponent $z$ and an anomalous\nscaling dimension $\\eta$. The approach of the non-thermal fixed point is, in\nparticular, found to involve a rescaling of momenta in time $t$ by $t^{\\beta}$,\nwith $\\beta=1/z$, within our kinetic approach independent of $\\eta$. We confirm\nour analytical predictions by numerically evaluating the kinetic scattering\nintegral as well as the non-perturbative many-body coupling function.

Often, such data sets are univariate and a proper reconstruction\nof the system's higher-dimensional phase space can be crucial for further\nanalyses. In this study, we systematically compare the methods of time delay\nembedding and differential embedding for phase space reconstruction.\nDifferential embedding relates the system's higher-dimensional coordinates to\nthe derivatives of the measured time series. For implementation, this requires\nrobust and efficient algorithms to estimate derivatives from noisy and possibly\nnon-uniformly sampled data. For this purpose, we consider several approaches:\n(i) central differences adapted to irregular sampling, (ii) a generalized\nversion of discrete Legendre coordinates and (iii) the concept of Moving Taylor\nBayesian Regression. We evaluate the performance of differential and time delay\nembedding by studying two paradigmatic model systems - the Lorenz and the\nR\\\"ossler system. More precisely, we compare geometric properties of the\nreconstructed attractors to those of the original attractors by applying\nrecurrence network analysis.

Both TB and cancer can\naffect several organs, e.g. lungs, brain, bones, intestines, skin. What in\ncancer is called malignant neoplasm (tumor) is called granuloma in TB. By\nisolating malignant cells (versus bacteria) from the rest of the body, such\nclusters protect the host's organism but at the same time they are \"secure\nbeachheads\" from where malignant cells (versus infected macrophages) can wander\noff to new locations. Thus, metastatic tumors have a TB parallel in the form of\nsecondary granulomas. In order to investigate more closely this parallel we use\nthe age-specific response of organs. Called spectrometric analysis in a\nprevious paper (Berrut et al. 2017), this method provides information about how\nfast tumors develop and how serious they become. A convenient characterization\nof the response to TB of organ j is given by the following (age-dependent)\ndeath ratio: Tj(t)=(death by TB of type j)/(all TB deaths) The development of\ncancer tumors can be described by a similar function Cj(t). We compare the\norgans' responses in all cases for which specific death data are available. It\nappears that for the same organ Tj(t) is similar in shape to Cj(t). For\ninstance, with regard to brain tumors, both TB and cancer mortality peak around\nthe age of 10. Such observations may bring to light vulnerabilities in the way\nthe immune system provides protection to various organs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 16:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Although several studies claimed a nova paternity\nfor certain grains, the measured and simulated isotopic ratios could only be\nreconciled assuming that the grains condensed after the nova ejecta mixed with\na much larger amount of close-to-solar matter. However, the source and\nmechanism of this potential post-explosion dilution of the ejecta remains a\nmystery. A major problem with previous studies is the small number of\nsimulations performed and the implied poor exploration of the large nova\nparameter space. We report the results of a different strategy, based on a\nMonte Carlo technique, that involves the random sampling over the most\nimportant nova model parameters: the white dwarf composition; the mixing of the\nouter white dwarf layers with the accreted material before the explosion; the\npeak temperature and density; the explosion time scales; and the possible\ndilution of the ejecta after the outburst. We discuss and take into account the\nsystematic uncertainties for both the presolar grain measurements and the\nsimulation results. Only those simulations that are consistent with all\nmeasured isotopic ratios of a given grain are accepted for further analysis. We\nalso present the numerical results of the model parameters.

In contrast to absorption in the\nEarth's atmosphere (telluric absorption), the planet transmission spectrum\nshifts in radial velocity during transit due to the changing orbital motion of\nthe planet. This allows us to remove the telluric spectrum while preserving the\nsignal of the exoplanet. The latter is then extracted by cross-correlating the\nresidual spectra with template models of the planet atmosphere computed through\nline-by-line radiative transfer calculations, and containing molecular\nabsorption lines from water and methane. By combining the signal of many\nthousands of planet molecular lines, we confirm the presence of water vapour in\nthe atmosphere of HD 189733 b at the 5.5-$\\sigma$ level.

A critical insight of our\nframework is to separate the descriptive complexity of the voting rule R from\nthe number of types of people. This allows us to finally settle the\ncomputational complexity of R-Swap Bribery, one of the most fundamental\nmanipulation problems. In particular, we prove that R-Swap Bribery is\nfixed-parameter tractable when R is Dodgson's rule and Young's rule, when\nparameterized by the number of candidates. This way, we resolve a long-standing\nopen question from 2007 which was explicitly asked by Faliszewski et al. [JAIR\n40, 2011].\n  Our algorithms reveal that the true hardness of bribery problems often stems\nfrom the complexity of the voting rules. On one hand, we give a fixed-parameter\nalgorithm parameterized by number of types of people for complex voting rules.\nThus, we reveal that R-Swap Bribery with Dodgson's rule is much harder than\nwith Condorcet's rule, which can be expressed by a conjunction of linear\ninequalities, while Dodson's rule requires quantifier alternation and a bounded\nnumber of disjunctions of linear systems. On the other hand, we give an\nalgorithm for quantifier-free voting rules which is parameterized only by the\nnumber of conjunctions of the voting rule and runs in time polynomial in the\nnumber of types of people. This way, our framework explains why Shift Bribery\nis polynomial-time solvable for the plurality voting rule, making explicit that\nthe rule is simple in that it can be expressed with a single linear inequality,\nand that the number of voter types is polynomial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

In the frame of relativistic MHD, we summarize the main results from Del\nZanna et al. [1]: the relativistic tearing instability is found to be extremely\nfast, with reconnection rates of the order of the inverse of the light crossing\ntime, as required to explain the high-energy explosive phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 13:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

We here report the first demonstration of dual THz comb spectroscopy\nusing a single free-running fibre laser. By tuning the cavity-loss-dependent\ngain profile with an intracavity Lyot filter together with precise management\nof the cavity length and dispersion, dual-wavelength pulsed light beams with\nslightly detuned repetition frequencies are generated in a single laser cavity.\nDue to sharing of the same cavity, such pulsed light beams suffer from\ncommon-mode fluctuation of the repetition frequency, and hence the\ncorresponding frequency difference between them is passively stable around a\nfew hundred hertz within millihertz fluctuation. This considerably stable\nfrequency difference enables dual THz comb spectroscopy with a single\nfree-running fibre laser. While greatly reducing the size, complexity, and cost\nof the laser source by use of a single free-running fibre laser, the dual THz\ncomb spectroscopy system maintains a spectral bandwidth and dynamic range of\nspectral power comparable to a system equipped with dual stabilized fibre\nlasers, and can be effectively applied to high-precision spectroscopy of\nacetonitrile gas at atmospheric pressure. The demonstrated results indicate\nthat this system is an attractive solution for practical applications of not\nonly THz spectroscopy but also THz-pulse-based measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 18:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

Our results demonstrate that recurrence-based\nmeasures can serve as excellent tracers for changes in the dynamical complexity\nalong non-stationary records of geomagnetic activity. In particular, trapping\ntime (characterizing the typical length of \"laminar phases\" in the observed\ndynamics) and recurrence network transitivity (associated with the number of\nthe system's effective dynamical degrees of freedom) allow for a very good\ndiscrimination between magnetic storm and quiescence phases.
