This so-called flat-top property provides a pathway to devise\na stable approximation over the whole domain. On each patch, we use $p$-th\ndegree orthogonal polynomials that ensure $p$-th order completeness, and in\naddition include eigenfunctions of the radial solution of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation.

This success is primarily due\nto vast capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet), enabling\nalgorithms to extract useful information from noisy environments. Capsule\nNetwork (CapsNet) is a recent introduction to the Deep Learning algorithm group\nand has only barely begun to be explored. The network is an architecture for\nimage classification, with superior performance for classification of the MNIST\ndataset. CapsNets have not been explored beyond image classification.\n  This thesis introduces the use of CapsNet for Q-Learning based game\nalgorithms. To successfully apply CapsNet in advanced game play, three main\ncontributions follow. First, the introduction of four new game environments as\nframeworks for RL research with increasing complexity, namely Flash RL, Deep\nLine Wars, Deep RTS, and Deep Maze. These environments fill the gap between\nrelatively simple and more complex game environments available for RL research\nand are in the thesis used to test and explore the CapsNet behavior.\n  Second, the thesis introduces a generative modeling approach to produce\nartificial training data for use in Deep Learning models including CapsNets. We\nempirically show that conditional generative modeling can successfully generate\ngame data of sufficient quality to train a Deep Q-Network well.\n  Third, we show that CapsNet is a reliable architecture for Deep Q-Learning\nbased algorithms for game AI. A capsule is a group of neurons that determine\nthe presence of objects in the data and is in the literature shown to increase\nthe robustness of training and predictions while lowering the amount training\ndata needed. It should, therefore, be ideally suited for game plays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 16:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

Evacuation\nsimulation can be used to estimate the required time for people to exit a\nbuilding or evacuate disaster exposed regions. While building evacuation\nsimulation has seen significant study, city evacuation simulation is less\ndeveloped. For evacuation simulations using Agent-Based Models, the\ncharacteristics of the underlying navigation algorithms are important in the\noverall efficiency of the simulation. In some disasters, e.g. earthquakes,\nevacuation takes place after the main event. This means evacuating and\nnavigating in an environment with damaged and collapsed buildings and bridges\nand obstructed roads and paths. Furthermore, possible aftershocks or induced\nphenomena, such as landslide and liquefaction, can render a more dynamic\nsituation for evacuees where the physical environment changes through time.\nEvacuees, modeled as agents, require a reliable algorithm for their navigation\nin these complex dynamic environments. A reliable navigation algorithm should\nbe capable of handling obstacles with different physical properties and\nperforming through dynamic environments. In this study, a framework is\nintroduced to evaluate the relative performance of agent navigation algorithms.\nThe main indices of this framework are Convergence, Optimality, Precision, and\nEfficiency (COPE).

As examples, we\nshow that the Bardeen potentials and the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable emerge\nnaturally in our analysis as observables when gauge fixing conditions are\ndetermined via clocks in the Hamiltonian framework. Similarly other gauge\ninvariant variables for various gauges can be systematically obtained. We\ndemonstrate this by analyzing five common gauge choices: longitudinal,\nspatially flat, uniform field, synchronous and comoving gauge. For all these,\nwe apply the observable map in the context of the relational formalism and\nobtain the corresponding Dirac observables associated with these choices of\nclocks. At the linear order, our analysis generalizes the existing results in\ncanonical cosmological perturbation theory twofold. On the one hand we can\ninclude also gauges that can only be analyzed in the context of the extended\nADM-phase space and furthermore, we obtain a set of natural gauge invariant\nvariables, namely the Dirac observables, for each considered choice of gauge\nconditions. Our analysis provides insights on which clocks should be used to\nextract the relevant natural physical observables both at the classical and\nquantum level. We also discuss how to generalize our analysis in a\nstraightforward way to higher orders in the perturbation theory to understand\ngauge conditions and the construction of gauge invariant quantities beyond\nlinear order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 17:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 14:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 00:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

These databases describe the\nsensitivity of many observers to a wide range of distortions (of different\nnature and with different suprathreshold intensities) seen on top of a variety\nof natural images. They seem like a dream for the vision scientist to check the\nmodels in realistic scenarios.\n  However, while these natural databases are great benchmarks for models\ndeveloped in some other way (e.g. by using the well-controlled artificial\nstimuli of traditional psychophysics), they should be carefully used when\ntrying to fit vision models. Given the high dimensionality of the image space,\nit is very likely that some basic phenomenon (e.g. sensitivity to distortions\nin certain environments) are under-represented in the database. Therefore, a\nmodel fitted on these large-scale natural databases will not reproduce these\nunder-represented basic phenomena that could otherwise be easily illustrated\nwith well selected artificial stimuli.\n  In this work we study a specific example of the above statement. A\nwavelet+divisive normalization layer of a sensible cascade of linear+nonlinear\nlayers fitted to maximize the correlation with subjective opinion of observers\non a large image quality database fails to reproduce basic crossmasking. Here\nwe outline a solution for this problem using artificial stimuli. Then, we show\nthat the resulting model is also a competitive solution for the large-scale\ndatabase. In line with Rust and Movshon (2005), our report (misrepresentation\nof basic visual phenomena in subjectively-rated natural image databases) is an\nadditional argument in praise of artifice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 17:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

We first define within-day\ntraffic dynamics with the point queue model, costs, the departure time user\nequilibrium (DTUE), and the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE). We then\nidentify three behavioral principles: (i) Drivers choose their departure and\narrival times in a backward fashion (backward choice principle); (ii) After\nchoosing the arrival times, they update their departure times to balance the\ntotal costs (cost balancing principle); (iii) They choose their arrival times\nto reduce their scheduling costs or gain their scheduling payoffs (scheduling\ncost reducing or scheduling payoff gaining principle). In this sense, drivers'\ndeparture and arrival time choices are driven by their scheduling payoff\nchoice. With a single tube or imaginary road model, we convert the nonlocal\nday-to-day arrival time shifting problem to a local scheduling payoff shifting\nproblem. After introducing a new variable for the imaginary density, we apply\nthe Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model to describe the day-to-day dynamics\nof scheduling payoff choice and present splitting and cost balancing schemes to\ndetermine arrival and departure flow-rates accordingly.

Typically, the observation noise is\nassumed to be independent of the evaluation point and to satisfy a tail bound\nuniformly on the domain; a restrictive assumption for many applications. In\nthis work, we consider bandits with heteroscedastic noise, where we explicitly\nallow the noise distribution to depend on the evaluation point. We show that\nthis leads to new trade-offs for information and regret, which are not taken\ninto account by existing approaches like upper confidence bound algorithms\n(UCB) or Thompson Sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a\nfrequentist regret analysis framework, that is similar to the Bayesian\nframework of Russo and Van Roy (2014), and we prove a new high-probability\nregret bound for general, possibly randomized policies, which depends on a\nquantity we refer to as regret-information ratio. From this bound, we define a\nfrequentist version of Information Directed Sampling (IDS) to minimize the\nregret-information ratio over all possible action sampling distributions. This\nfurther relies on concentration inequalities for online least squares\nregression in separable Hilbert spaces, which we generalize to the case of\nheteroscedastic noise. We then formulate several variants of IDS for linear and\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space response functions, yielding novel algorithms\nfor Bayesian optimization. We also prove frequentist regret bounds, which in\nthe homoscedastic case recover known bounds for UCB, but can be much better\nwhen the noise is heteroscedastic. Empirically, we demonstrate in a linear\nsetting with heteroscedastic noise, that some of our methods can outperform UCB\nand Thompson Sampling, while staying competitive when the noise is\nhomoscedastic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 18:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 17:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}

We found a\nclear outside-in gradient with radius of the time when the quenching event\nstarted: the outermost radii have been stripped 500 Myr ago, while the\nstripping has reached the inner 5 kpc from the center in the last 100 Myr.\nRegions at even smaller radii are currently still forming stars fueled by the\npresence of HI and H2 gas. When compared to statistical studies of the\nquenching timescales in the local Universe we find that ram pressure stripping\nof the cold gas is an effective mechanism to reduce the transformation times\nfor galaxies falling into massive clusters. Future systematic studies of all\nthe active galaxies observed by VESTIGE in the Virgo cluster will extend these\nresults to a robust statistical framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 09:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

Recent evidence\nthat bulge-less galaxies, which are unlikely to have had significant mergers,\nare offset from the $M_{\\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but lie\non the $M_{\\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\\star}$ relation, has strengthened this\nhypothesis. Nevertheless, the small size and heterogeneity of current datasets,\ncoupled with the difficulty in measuring precise BH masses, makes it\nchallenging to address this issue using empirical studies alone.

However, the physical\nmechanism responsible for driving the observed outflows remains unclear, and\nwhether it is due to momentum, energy, or radiation is still a matter of\ndebate. The observed outflow energetics, in particular the large measured\nvalues of the momentum ratio ($\\dot{p}/(L/c) \\sim 10$) and energy ratio\n($\\dot{E}_k/L \\sim 0.05$), seems to favour the energy-driving mechanism; and\nmost observational works have focused their comparison with wind energy-driven\nmodels.

In particular,\nwe predict a sub-linear scaling for the mass outflow rate ($\\dot{M} \\propto\nL^{1/2}$) and a super-linear scaling for the kinetic power ($\\dot{E}_k \\propto\nL^{3/2}$), in agreement with the observational scaling relations reported in\nthe most recent compilation of AGN outflow data.

We apply\nlarge-scale network properties, such as the connectivity and degree\ndistribution of human and Web robot session graphs in order to identify\ncharacteristics of the traffic which would be useful for modeling web traffic\nand improving cache performance. We find that the empirical degree\ndistributions of session graphs for human and robot requests on one Web server\nare best fit by different theoretical distributions, indicating at a difference\nin the processes which generate the traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 19:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

This effect known as pileup pollutes the final state of the\ncollision. It complicates the reconstruction of the objects in this final\nstate, resulting in increased experimental uncertainties. To reduce these\nuncertainties, and improve the quality and precision of LHC measurements,\ntechniques are devised to correct for the effects of pileup.

Classifiers require\ntraining sets to learn the underlying patterns that allow the separation among\nclasses. Unfortunately, building training sets is an expensive process that\ndemands a lot of human efforts. Every time data comes from new surveys; the\nonly available training instances are the ones that have a cross-match with\npreviously labelled objects, consequently generating insufficient training sets\ncompared with the large amounts of unlabelled sources.

We also develop a fast similarity function specific\nfor light curves, based on a novel data structure that allows scaling the\nsearch over the entire dataset of unlabelled objects. Experiments show that our\nunsupervised model achieves high accuracy in the classification of different\ntypes of variable stars and that the proposed algorithm scales up to massive\namounts of light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 19:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

This could help to probe the jet magnetic field\ngeometry (e.g. helical or otherwise). This new high-sensitivity data, shows a\ncomplicated behaviour in the total intensity and polarization radio spectrum of\nindividual sources. We observed the presence of several synchrotron components\nand Faraday components in their total intensity and polarized spectra. For the\nmajority of our targets, (12 sources) the depolarization seems to be caused by\na turbulent magnetic field. Thus, our main selection criteria (lack of\npolarization at 1.4 GHz in the NVSS), results in a sample of sources with very\nlarge RMs and depolarization due to turbulent magnetic fields local to the\nsource. We show how the new qu-fitting technique can be used to probe the\nmagnetised radio source environment and to spectrally resolve the polarized\ncomponents of unresolved radio sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 19:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 17:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Most surveys generate a vast amount\nof time series, or \\quotes{lightcurves}, that represent the brightness\nvariability of stellar objects in time. Unfortunately, lightcurves'\nobservations take several years to be completed, producing truncated time\nseries that generally remain without the application of automatic classifiers\nuntil they are finished. This happens because state of the art methods rely on\na variety of statistical descriptors or features that present an increasing\ndegree of dispersion when the number of observations decreases, which reduces\ntheir precision. In this paper we propose a novel method that increases the\nperformance of automatic classifiers of variable stars by incorporating the\ndeviations that scarcity of observations produces. Our method uses Gaussian\nProcess Regression to form a probabilistic model of each lightcurve's\nobservations. Then, based on this model, bootstrapped samples of the time\nseries features are generated. Finally a bagging approach is used to improve\nthe overall performance of the classification. We perform tests on the MACHO\nand OGLE catalogs, results show that our method classifies effectively some\nvariability classes using a small fraction of the original observations. For\nexample, we found that RR Lyrae stars can be classified with around 80\\% of\naccuracy just by observing the first 5\\% of the whole lightcurves' observations\nin MACHO and OGLE catalogs. We believe these results prove that, when studying\nlightcurves, it is important to consider the features' error and how the\nmeasurement process impacts it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 19:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

We first use an analytic disk model to demonstrate that newly-formed giant\nplanets have a long migration epoch before photoevaporation can significantly\nalter their migration rates. Next we present new 2-D hydrodynamic simulations\nof planets migrating in photoevaporating disks, each paired with a control\nsimulation of migration in an otherwise identical disk without\nphotoevaporation. We show that in disks with surface densities near the minimum\nthreshold for forming giant planets, photoevaporation alters the final\nsemimajor axis of a migrating gas giant by at most 5% over the course of 0.1\nMyr of migration. Once the disk mass is low enough for photoevaporation to\ncarve a sharp gap, migration has almost completely stalled due to the low\nsurface density of gas at the Lindblad resonances.

To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel approach that combines a probabilistic physical damage catastrophe model\nwith a new generation of macroeconomic agent-based models (ABMs). The ABM moves\nbeyond the state of the art by exploiting large data sets from detailed\nnational accounts, census data, and business information, etc., to simulate\ninteractions of millions of agents representing \\emph{each} natural person or\nlegal entity in a national economy. The catastrophe model introduces a copula\napproach to assess flood losses, considering spatial dependencies of the flood\nhazard. These loss estimates are used in a damage scenario generator that\nprovides input for the ABM, which then estimates indirect economic losses due\nto the event. For the first time, we are able to link environmental and\neconomic processes in a computer simulation at this level of detail. We show\nthat moderate disasters induce comparably small but positive short- to\nmedium-term, and negative long-term economic impacts. Large-scale events,\nhowever, trigger a pronounced negative economic response immediately after the\nevent and in the long term, while exhibiting a temporary short- to medium-term\neconomic boost. We identify winners and losers in different economic sectors,\nincluding the fiscal consequences for the government. We quantify the critical\ndisaster size beyond which the resilience of an economy to rebuild reaches its\nlimits.

It is anticipated that in future such medical records will be shared\nthrough cloud among different physicians to improve the quality of health care.\nTherefore, right protection of medical records is important to protect their\nownership once they are shared with third parties. Watermarking is a proven\nwell known technique to achieve this objective. The challenges associated with\nwatermarking of EMR systems are: (1) some fields in EMR are more relevant in\nthe diagnosis process; as a result, small variations in them could change the\ndiagnosis, and (2) a misdiagnosis might not only result in a life threatening\nscenario but also might lead to significant costs of the treatment for the\npatients.

OCT images from 10 patients with mild\nnon-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were used from a public (U. of Miami)\ndataset. For each patient, five images were available: one image of the fovea\ncenter, two images of the perifovea, and two images of the parafovea. For each\nimage, two expert graders each manually annotated five retinal surfaces (i.e.\nboundaries between pairs of retinal layers). The first grader's annotations\nwere used as ground truth and the second grader's annotations to compute\ninter-operator agreement. The proposed automated approach segments images using\nfully convolutional networks (FCNs) together with Gaussian process (GP)-based\nregression as a post-processing step to improve the quality of the estimates.\nUsing 10-fold cross validation, the performance of the algorithms is determined\nby computing the per-pixel unsigned error (distance) between the automated\nestimates and the ground truth annotations generated by the first manual\ngrader. We compare the proposed method against five state of the art automatic\nsegmentation techniques. The results show that the proposed methods compare\nfavorably with state of the art techniques, resulting in the smallest mean\nunsigned error values and associated standard deviations, and performance is\ncomparable with human annotation of retinal layers from OCT when there is only\nmild retinopathy. The results suggest that semantic segmentation using FCNs,\ncoupled with regression-based post-processing, can effectively solve the OCT\nsegmentation problem on par with human capabilities with mild retinopathy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 20:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

The force exerted by the tether on the droplets is\nshown to be asymmetric with respect to the phase inversion temperature of the\nemulsion, in agreement with experiment.

Another approach, initiated by Robert Spekkens, generalizes the\nconcept to any type of experimental procedure. This new form of \"universal\"\ncontextuality has been raised as a criterion of non-classicality, i.e. of\nweirdness. It notably led to identify the nature of curious quantum paradoxes\ninvolving post-selections and weak measurements. In the light of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the publication of the Kochen-Specker theorem, this report aims\nto introduce these results little known to the French scientific public, in the\ncontext of an investigation on the nature of the weirdness of quantum physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 21:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes\n(POMDPs) provide a standard framework for modeling uncertainty in many\napplications.

This POMDP formulation is different from the traditional\nPOMDP models with optimality objectives and we show that in some cases, POMDPs\nwith safe-reachability objectives can provide a better guarantee of both safety\nand reachability than the existing POMDP models through an example. A key\nalgorithmic problem for POMDPs is policy synthesis, which requires reasoning\nover a vast space of beliefs (probability distributions). To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the notion of a goal-constrained belief space, which\nonly contains beliefs reachable from the initial belief under desired\nexecutions that can achieve the given safe-reachability objective. Our method\ncompactly represents this space over a bounded horizon using symbolic\nconstraints, and employs an incremental Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)\nsolver to efficiently search for a valid policy over it.

As a\ngeneralization of the Poisson distribution, the COM-Poisson distribution can\ndeal with under-, equi- and overdispersed count data. It is a member of the\nexponential family of distributions and has well known special cases. In spite\nof the nice properties of the COM-Poisson distribution, its location parameter\ndoes not correspond to the expectation, which complicates the interpretation of\nregression models. In this paper, we propose a straightforward\nreparametrization of the COM-Poisson distribution based on an approximation to\nthe expectation of this distribution. The main advantage of our new\nparametrization is the straightforward interpretation of the regression\ncoefficients in terms of the expectation, as usual in the context of\ngeneralized linear models. Furthermore, the estimation and inference for the\nnew COM-Poisson regression model can be done based on the likelihood paradigm.\nWe carried out simulation studies to verify the finite sample properties of the\nmaximum likelihood estimators. The results from our simulation study show that\nthe maximum likelihood estimators are unbiased and consistent for both\nregression and dispersion parameters. We observed that the empirical\ncorrelation between the regression and dispersion parameter estimators is close\nto zero, which suggests that these parameters are orthogonal. We illustrate the\napplication of the proposed model through the analysis of three data sets with\nover-, under- and equidispersed count data.

We\nexploit the simultaneous 1.2mm and 2.0mm imaging capability of NIKA on the IRAM\n30m telescope to construct maps of beta for both clouds, and by incorporating\nHerschel observations, we create H2 column density maps with 13\" resolution.\nWhile we find no significant systematic radial variations around the most\nmassive clumps in either cloud on >0.1 pc scales, their mean beta values are\nsignificantly different, with beta = 2.07 +/- 0.09 (rand) +/- 0.25 (syst) for\nSDC18.888 and beta = 1.71 +/- 0.09 (rand) +/- 0.25 (syst) for SDC24.489.

The summary\nis expressed using a high-level intermediate language resembling the MapReduce\nparadigm and verified to be semantically equivalent to the original using a\ntheorem prover. (2) Casper generates executable code from the summary, using\neither the Hadoop, Spark, or Flink API.

Thus the departure time user\nequilibrium (DTUE), the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE), and the\nscheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE) are uniquely determined by the\nstationary state of the LWR model, which was shown to be locally,\nasymptotically stable with analysis of the discrete approximation of the LWR\nmodel and through a numerical example. In this study attempt to analytically\nprove the global stability of the SPUE, ATUE, and DTUE. We first generalize the\nconceptual models for arrival time and scheduling payoff choices developed in\n(Jin, 2018) for a single bottleneck with a generalized scheduling cost\nfunction, which includes the cost of the free-flow travel time. Then we present\nthe LWR model for the day-to-day dynamics for the scheduling payoff choice as\nwell as the SPUE. We further formulate a new optimization problem for the SPUE\nand demonstrate its equivalent to the optimization problem for the ATUE in\n(Iryo and Yoshii, 2007). Finally we show that the objective functions in the\ntwo optimization formulations are equal and can be used as the potential\nfunction for the LWR model and prove that the stationary state of the LWR\nmodel, and therefore, the SPUE, DTUE, and ATUE, are globally, asymptotically\nstable, by using Lyapunov's second method.

As a result, Bayesian methods, which treat model parameters\nas random variables and attempt to estimate their probability distributions\ngiven data, have become popular in systems biology. Bayesian parameter\nestimation often relies on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample\nmodel parameter distributions, but the slow convergence of MCMC sampling can be\na major bottleneck. One approach to improving performance is parallel tempering\n(PT), a physics-based method that uses swapping between multiple Markov chains\nrun in parallel at different temperatures to accelerate sampling. The\ntemperature of a Markov chain determines the probability of accepting an\nunfavorable move, so swapping with higher temperatures chains enables the\nsampling chain to escape from local minima.

These observations are here conducted on other lattice\nstructures, with the goal of identifying models of reduced complexity that are\nable to provide insight into the key parameters that govern the onset of\ninstability-induced localization. To this end, we first consider a\ntwo-dimensional square lattice consisting of point masses connected by in-plane\naxial springs and vertical ground springs. Results illustrate that depending on\nthe choice of spring constants and their relative values, the lattice exhibits\nin-plane or out-of plane instabilities leading to folding and unfolding. This\nmodel is further simplified by considering the one-dimensional case of a\nspring-mass chain sitting on an elastic foundation. A bifurcation analysis of\nthis lattice identifies the stable and unstable branches and illustrates its\nhysteretic and loading path-dependent behaviors.

The efficiency of this\nprocess is enhanced by stop-antistop annihilations into the longitudinal\n(Goldstone) modes of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, as well as by Sommerfeld\nenhancement of stop annihilations and the effects of bound states. Since the\ncouplings of the stops to the Goldstone modes are proportional to the trilinear\nsoft supersymmetry-breaking $A$-terms, these annihilations are enhanced when\nthe $A$-terms are large. However, the Higgs mass may be reduced below the\nmeasured value if the $A$-terms are too large. Unfortunately, the\ninterpretation of this constraint on the stop coannihilation strip is clouded\nby differences between the available Higgs mass calculators. For our study, we\nuse as our default calculator FeynHiggs 2.13.0, the most recent publicly\navailable version of this code. Exploring the CMSSM parameter space, we find\nthat along the stop coannihilation strip the masses of the stops are severely\nsplit by the large $A$-terms. This suppresses the Higgs mass drastically for\n$\\mu$ and $A_0 > 0$, whilst the extent of the stop coannihilation strip is\nlimited for $A_0 < 0$ and either sign of $\\mu$. However, in sub-GUT models,\nreduced renormalization-group running mitigates the effect of the large\n$A$-terms, allowing larger LSP masses to be consistent with the Higgs mass\ncalculation. We give examples where the dark matter particle mass may reach\n$\\gtrsim 8$ TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 05:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

After that, ReNN makes global-based\ninferences that synthesizes the local patterns and the rule-modulated map. To\nsolve the optimization problem caused by rules, we use a two-stage optimization\nstrategy to train the ReNN model. By introducing rules into ReNN, we can\nstrengthen traditional neural networks with long-term dependencies which are\ndifficult to learn with limited empirical dataset, thus improving inference\naccuracy. The complexity of neural networks can be reduced since long-term\ndependencies are not modeled with neural connections, and thus the amount of\ndata needed to optimize the neural networks can be reduced. Besides, inferences\nfrom ReNN can be analyzed with both local patterns and rules, and thus have\nbetter interpretability.

Max- or average- pooling operation, which compresses\nthe sequence of words into fixed-dimensional vectors, becomes the bottleneck of\ninformation. In this paper, we propose to learn attention-based word-level\ninteractions between questions and relations to alleviate the bottleneck issue.\nSimilar to the traditional models, the question and relation are firstly\nrepresented as sequences of vectors. Then, instead of merging the sequence into\na single vector with pooling operation, soft alignments between words from the\nquestion and the relation are learned. The aligned words are subsequently\ncompared with the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the comparison results\nare merged finally. Through performing the comparison on low-level\nrepresentations, the attention-based word-level interaction model (ABWIM)\nrelieves the information loss issue caused by merging the sequence into a\nfixed-dimensional vector before the comparison. The experimental results of\nrelation detection on both SimpleQuestions and WebQuestions datasets show that\nABWIM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Special care must be taken when\nmaterials at extreme conditions are under study. Superconductors and devices\nassembled from superconductors and other materials, like superconducting\nmagnets, are often operated at such extreme conditions: at low temperatures\nunder high magnetic fields and stresses. Typically, some library or database is\nused for getting the data. We have started to develop a database for storing\nall kind of material property data online called Open Material Property Library\nWith Native Simulation Tool Integrations -- MASTO.

The guiding idea in MASTO is to build\neasy-to-use integration for various programming languages, modelling frameworks\nand simulation software. Currently, a full-fledged integration is built for\nMATLAB to allow users to fetch and use data with one-liners. In this paper we\nbriefly review some of the material property databases commonly used in\nsuperconductor modelling, present a case study showing how selection of the\nmaterial property data can influence the simulation results, and introduce the\nprincipal ideas behind MASTO.

An initial analysis\nwas on the room acoustics of the recordings. The parameters of interest were\nsound pressure level, autocorrelation and spectral centroid. The auditory\nmodels were used to analyze echolocation resulting from the perceptual\nvariables, i.e. loudness, pitch and sharpness. Relevant auditory models were\nchosen to simulate each variable.

Difference thresholds were calculated\nfor the psychophysical variables, since a 2-Alternative-Forced-Choice Paradigm\nhad originally been used. We found that (1) blind persons could detect objects\nat lower loudness values, lower pitch strength, different sharpness values and\nat further distances than sighted persons, (2) detection thresholds based on\nrepetition pitch, loudness and sharpness varied and depended on room acoustics\nand type of sound stimuli, (3) repetition pitch was useful for detection at\nshorter distances and was determined from the peaks in the temporal profile of\nthe autocorrelation function, (4) loudness at shorter distances provides\necholocation information, (5) at longer distances, timbre aspects, such as\nsharpness, might be used to detect objects.

Here, we rely on computational\nmethods based on network analyses and opinion dynamics to described how\nindividuals influence each other during a group discussion. We consider the\nsituation in which a small group of three individuals engages in a discussion\nto solve an estimation task. We propose a model describing how group members\ngradually influence each other and revise their judgments over the course of\nthe discussion. The main component of the model is an influence network - a\nweighted, directed graph that determines the extent to which individuals\ninfluence each other during the discussion.

Existing methods generally use the global image as input for network\nlearning. Such a strategy is limited in two aspects. 1) A thorax disease\nusually happens in (small) localized areas which are disease specific. Training\nCNNs using global image may be affected by the (excessive) irrelevant noisy\nareas. 2) Due to the poor alignment of some CXR images, the existence of\nirregular borders hinders the network performance. In this paper, we address\nthe above problems by proposing a three-branch attention guided convolution\nneural network (AG-CNN). AG-CNN 1) learns from disease-specific regions to\navoid noise and improve alignment, 2) also integrates a global branch to\ncompensate the lost discriminative cues by local branch. Specifically, we first\nlearn a global CNN branch using global images. Then, guided by the attention\nheat map generated from the global branch, we inference a mask to crop a\ndiscriminative region from the global image. The local region is used for\ntraining a local CNN branch. Lastly, we concatenate the last pooling layers of\nboth the global and local branches for fine-tuning the fusion branch. The\nComprehensive experiment is conducted on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We first\nreport a strong global baseline producing an average AUC of 0.841 with\nResNet-50 as backbone. After combining the local cues with the global\ninformation, AG-CNN improves the average AUC to 0.868. While DenseNet-121 is\nused, the average AUC achieves 0.871, which is a new state of the art in the\ncommunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 10:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

J1748-2446aj has a\nspin period of ~2.96 ms, J1748-2446ak of ~1.89 ms (thus it is the fourth\nfastest pulsar in the cluster) and J1748-2446al of ~5.95 ms. All the three\nmillisecond pulsars are isolated and currently we have timing solutions only\nfor J1748-2446aj and J1748-2446ak. For these two systems, we evaluated the\ncontribution to the measured spin-down rate of the acceleration due to the\ncluster potential field, thus estimating the intrinsic spin-down rates, which\nare in agreement with those typically measured for millisecond pulsars in\nglobular clusters. Our results increase to 37 the number of pulsars known in\nTerzan 5, which now hosts 25% of the entire pulsar population identified, so\nfar, in globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 10:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Then,\non very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad\nequation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system,\nas well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of\ncurvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations\nconstrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the\ninteraction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes\nby the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths.\nTherefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur\nwithout altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify\nall scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the\ncase in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show\nthat this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the\npower spectrum is quasi scale invariant. In that case, the presence of the\nenvironment improves the fit to the data for some inflationary models but\ndeteriorates it for others. This clearly demonstrates that decoherence is not\nonly of theoretical importance but can also be crucial for astrophysical\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 06:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

This state is not based on a pre-defined\nsymmetry of the system and its construction is via Jaynes' entropy maximisation\nprinciple. The second are Gibbs states encoding structural equilibrium with\nrespect to internal translations on the GFT base manifold, and defined via the\nKMS condition. The third are Gibbs states encoding relational equilibrium with\nrespect to a clock Hamiltonian, obtained by deparametrization with respect to\ncoupled scalar matter fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:46:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

However, the\ngravitational-wave signal emitted by an inspiraling binary neutron star system\nis only weakly dependent on the equation of state and extracting this\ninformation is challenging. Previous studies have focused mainly on binary\nsystems where the neutron stars are spinning slowly and the main imprint of\nneutron star matter in the inspiral signal is due to tidal effects. For\nbinaries with non-negligible neutron-star spin the deformation of the neutron\nstar due to its own rotation introduces additional variations in the emitted\ngravitational-wave signal. Here we explore whether highly spinning binary\nneutron-star systems offer a better chance to measure the equation-of-state\nthan weakly spinning binary-neutron star systems. We focus on the dominant\nadiabatic quadrupolar effects and consider three main questions. First, we show\nthat equation-of-state effects can be significant in the inspiral waveforms,\nand that the spin-quadrupole effect dominates for rapidly rotating neutron\nstars. Second, we show that variations in the spin-quadrupole phasing are\nstrongly degenerate with changes in the component masses and spins, and\nneglecting these terms has a negligible impact on the number of observations\nwith second generation observatories. Finally, we explore the bias in the\nmasses and spins that would be introduced by using incorrect equation-of-state\nterms. Using a novel method to rapidly evaluate an approximation of the\nlikelihood we show that assuming the incorrect equation-of-state when measuring\nsource parameters can lead to a significant bias. We also find that the ability\nto measure the equation-of-state is improved when considering spinning systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 13:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

A key is specification of the\nposition and the momentum of a nucleon inside a nucleus to be struck by the\nincident nucleon. In this paper the semiclassical distorted wave model\nincorporating the Wigner transform of the one-body nuclear density matrix is\napplied to the calculation of excitation energy distributions of reaction\nresidues. Decay of a residue is described by introducing a threshold parameter\nfor the minimum excitation energy of it. With reasonable values of the\nparameter, the measured sigma_-1N for several LLFPs are reproduced by the\nproposed reaction model. The incident energy dependence of sigma_-1N is found\nto be governed by that of the nucleon-nucleon cross sections at energies higher\nthan about 75 MeV. At low energies, the nuclear absorption and the Coulomb\npenetrability also become important. The energy dependence of neutron-induced\nsigma_-1N is predicted and found to be quite different from that of proton\ninduced one. The proposed reaction model is shown to be promising in discussing\nthe energy dependence of nucleon-induced inclusive one-nucleon knockout\nprocesses.

The active damping strategy is designed to reduce the\ndegrading impact on maneuvering and pointing performance via a force feedback\nstrategy. Many problems have been encountered until now, such as instability of\nthe closed loop system, excessive consumption in the attitude propellant or\nproblems for engine re-ignition in upper stages. Mostly, they have been\naddressed in a passive way via the design of baffles and membranes, which on\ntheir own have mass and constructive impacts. Active management of propellant\nmotion in launchers and satellites has the potential to increase performance on\nvarious levels. This paper demonstrates active slosh management using force\nfeedback for the compensation of the slosh resonances. Force sensors between\ntank and the carrying structure provide information of the fluid motion via the\nreaction force. The control system is designed to generate an appropriate\nacceleration profile that leads to desired attenuation profiles in amplitude,\nfrequency and time. Two robust control design methods, one based on $\\mu$\ndesign and the other on parametric structured design based on non-smooth\noptimization of the worst-case $H_{\\infty}$ norm, are applied. The controller\nis first tested with a computational fluid dynamics simulation in the loop.\nFinally a water tank mounted on a Hexapod with up to $1100$ liter is used to\nevaluate the control performance. The paper illustrates that is possible to\nactively influence sloshing via closed loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 14:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

Finally, an optimal control problem,\nassociated with the intracellular delayed HIV model with CTL immune response,\nis posed and investigated. The problem is shown to have an unique solution,\nwhich is characterized via Pontryagin's minimum principle for problems with\ndelays. Numerical simulations are performed, confirming stability of the\ndisease-free and endemic equilibria and illustrating the effectiveness of the\ntwo incorporated treatments via optimal control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 15:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

A measure of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the\nUniverse is provided by the present value of the universal ratio of baryons\n(baryons minus antibaryons) to photons (or the ratio of baryons to entropy).\nThe baryon asymmetry parameter is an important physical and cosmological\nparameter. But how fine tuned is it? A \"natural\" value for this parameter is\nzero, corresponding to equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Another, also\npossibly natural, choice for this dimensionless parameter would be of order\nunity, corresponding to nearly equal amounts (by number) of matter (and\nessentially no antimatter) and photons in every comoving volume. However,\nobservations suggest that in the Universe we inhabit the value of this\nparameter is nonzero, but smaller than this natural value by some nine to ten\norders of magnitude. In this contribution we review the evidence that our\nUniverse does not contain equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Any change in\nthe magnitude of the baryon asymmetry parameter necessarily leads to a universe\nwith physical characteristics different from those in our own.

Most previous methods align high-level representations, e.g.,\nactivations of the fully connected (FC) layers. In these methods, however, the\nconvolutional layers which underpin critical low-level domain knowledge cannot\nbe updated directly towards reducing domain discrepancy. Specifically, we\nassume that the discriminative regions in an image are relatively invariant to\nimage style changes. Based on this assumption, we propose an attention\nalignment scheme on all the target convolutional layers to uncover the\nknowledge shared by the source domain. Second, we estimate the posterior label\ndistribution of the unlabeled data for target network training. Previous\nmethods, which iteratively update the pseudo labels by the target network and\nrefine the target network by the updated pseudo labels, are vulnerable to label\nestimation errors. Instead, our approach uses category distribution to\ncalculate the cross-entropy loss for training, thereby ameliorating the error\naccumulation of the estimated labels. The two contributions allow our approach\nto outperform the state-of-the-art methods by +2.6% on the Office-31 dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 15:55:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 16:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 15:39:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 16:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

In this paper we study the problem from a new perspective and\npresent a novel parallel tracking and verifying (PTAV) framework, by taking\nadvantage of the ubiquity of multi-thread techniques and borrowing ideas from\nthe success of parallel tracking and mapping in visual SLAM. The proposed PTAV\nframework is typically composed of two components, a (base) tracker T and a\nverifier V, working in parallel on two separate threads. The tracker T aims to\nprovide a super real-time tracking inference and is expected to perform well\nmost of the time; by contrast, the verifier V validates the tracking results\nand corrects T when needed. The key innovation is that, V does not work on\nevery frame but only upon the requests from T; on the other end, T may adjust\nthe tracking according to the feedback from V. With such collaboration, PTAV\nenjoys both the high efficiency provided by T and the strong discriminative\npower by V. Meanwhile, to adapt V to object appearance changes over time, we\nmaintain a dynamic target template pool for adaptive verification, resulting in\nfurther performance improvements. In our extensive experiments on popular\nbenchmarks including OTB2015, TC128, UAV20L and VOT2016, PTAV achieves the best\ntracking accuracy among all real-time trackers, and in fact even outperforms\nmany deep learning based algorithms.

This applies in particular\nto multi-chip concepts, where components can be individually optimized and\ntested on separate dies before integration into more complex systems. The\nassembly of such systems, however, still represents a major challenge,\nrequiring complex and expensive processes for high-precision alignment as well\nas careful adaptation of optical mode profiles. Here we show that these\nchallenges can be overcome by in-situ nano-printing of freeform beam-shaping\nelements to facets of optical components. The approach is applicable to a wide\nvariety of devices and assembly concepts and allows adaptation of vastly\ndissimilar mode profiles while considerably relaxing alignment tolerances to\nthe extent that scalable, cost-effective passive assembly techniques can be\nused. We experimentally prove the viability of the concept by fabricating and\ntesting a selection of beam-shaping elements at chip and fiber facets,\nachieving coupling efficiencies of up to 88 % between an InP laser and an\noptical fiber. We also demonstrate printed freeform mirrors for simultaneously\nadapting beam shape and propagation direction, and we explore multi-lens\nsystems for beam expansion. The concept paves the way to automated fabrication\nof photonic multi-chip assemblies with unprecedented performance and\nversatility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 21:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

However, manual analysis of EEG data requires\nhighly trained clinicians, and is a procedure that is known to have relatively\nlow inter-rater agreement (IRA). Moreover, the volume of the data and the rate\nat which new data becomes available make manual interpretation a\ntime-consuming, resource-hungry, and expensive process. In contrast, automated\nanalysis of EEG data offers the potential to improve the quality of patient\ncare by shortening the time to diagnosis and reducing manual error. In this\npaper, we focus on one of the first steps in interpreting an EEG session -\nidentifying whether the brain activity is abnormal or normal. To solve this\ntask, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture termed\nChronoNet which is inspired by recent developments from the field of image\nclassification and designed to work efficiently with EEG data. ChronoNet is\nformed by stacking multiple 1D convolution layers followed by deep gated\nrecurrent unit (GRU) layers where each 1D convolution layer uses multiple\nfilters of exponentially varying lengths and the stacked GRU layers are densely\nconnected in a feed-forward manner. We used the recently released TUH Abnormal\nEEG Corpus dataset for evaluating the performance of ChronoNet. Unlike previous\nstudies using this dataset, ChronoNet directly takes time-series EEG as input\nand learns meaningful representations of brain activity patterns. ChronoNet\noutperforms the previously reported best results by 7.79% thereby setting a new\nbenchmark for this dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate the domain-independent\nnature of ChronoNet by successfully applying it to classify speech commands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 05:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 00:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

Eigen spectra of PCA perform the Fano type resonances.3D\nvector field spectra reveal the Homoclinic orbit Lorenz attractor. Quantum\nconfinement effects are observed by 3D representation of LDA. Standing wave\npatterns resulting from oscillations of ion acoustic phonon and electron waves\nare illustrated through the eigen spectra of LDA. Such capabilities of GNPs\nhave brought high attention for the high energy density physics applications.\nFurthermore, accurate prediction of gold nanoparticle (GNP) sizes using machine\nlearning could provide rapid analysis without the need for expensive analysis.\nTwo hybrid algorithms consist of unsupervised PCA and two different supervised\nANN have been used to estimate the diameters of GNPs. PCA based artificial\nneural network (ANN) were found to estimate the diameters with a high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 18:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 20:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 20:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 00:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 22:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}
