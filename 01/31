This paper describes how to construct the decision tree and\nexplains why 3-SAT has no polynomial-time algorithm when the decision tree is\nformed in the 3-SAT instance. The indistinguishable binomial decision tree\nconsists of polynomial numbers of nodes containing an indistinguishable\nvariable pair but generates exponentially many paths connecting the clauses to\nbe used for sequences of resolution steps. The number of paths starting from\nthe root node and arriving at a child node forms a binomial coefficient. In\naddition, each path has an indistinguishable property from one another. Due to\nthe exponential number of paths and their indistinguishability, if an\nindistinguishable binomial decision tree is constructed in which there exist\none or more paths generating an empty clause, the number of calculation steps\nneeded to extract the empty clause is not polynomially bounded. This result\nleads to the conclusion that class P is a proper subset of class NP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 16:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

The pattern\nand deposition rate of plume material on Enceladus' surface is of interest\nbecause it provides valuable information about the dynamics of the ice particle\nejection as well as the surface erosion. Surface deposition maps derived from\nnumerical plume simulations by Kempf et al. (2010) have been used by various\nresearchers to interpret data obtained by various Cassini instruments. Here, an\nupdated and detailed set of deposition maps is provided based on a deep-source\nplume model (Schmidt et al., 2008), for the eight ice-particle jets identified\nin Spitale and Porco (2007), the updated set of jets proposed in Porco et al.\n(2014), and a contrasting curtain-style plume proposed in Spitale et al.\n(2015). Methods for computing the surface deposition are detailed, and the\nstructure of surface deposition patterns is shown to be consistent across\nchanges in the production rate and size distribution of the plume. Maps are\nalso provided of the surface deposition structure originating in each of the\nfour Tiger Stripes. Finally, the differing approaches used in Porco et al.\n(2014) and Spitale et al. (2015) have given rise to a jets vs. curtains\ncontroversy regarding the emission structure of the Enceladus plume. Here we\nsimulate each, leading to new insight that, over time, most emissions must be\ndirected relatively orthogonal to the surface because jets \"tilted\"\nsignificantly away from orthogonal lead to surface deposition patterns\ninconsistent with surface images.\n  Data for maps are available in HDF5 format for a variety of particle sizes at\nhttp://impact.colorado.edu/southworth_data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 16:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 17:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 18:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

This is particularly important for the elections in which\nresults affect the economy of a sizable population. A better prediction of the\ntrue outcome helps reduce the surprise and keeps the voters prepared. This\npaper starts from the basic observation that individuals in the underlying\npopulation build estimates of the distribution of preferences of the whole\npopulation based on their local neighborhoods. The outcome of the election\nleads to a surprise if these local estimates contradict the outcome of the\nelection for some fixed voting rule. To get a quantitative understanding, we\npropose a simple mathematical model of the setting where the individuals in the\npopulation and their connections (through geographical proximity, social\nnetworks etc.) are described by a random graph with connection probabilities\nthat are biased based on the preferences of the individuals. Each individual\nalso has some estimate of the bias in their connections.\n  We show that the election outcome leads to a surprise if the discrepancy\nbetween the estimated bias and the true bias in the local connections exceeds a\ncertain threshold, and confirm the phenomenon that surprising outcomes are\nassociated only with {\\em closely contested elections}. We compare standard\nvoting rules based on their performance on surprise and show that they have\ndifferent behavior for different parts of the population. It also hints at an\nimpossibility that a single voting rule will be less surprising for {\\em all}\nparts of a population. Finally, we experiment with the UK-EU referendum\n(a.k.a.\\ Brexit) dataset that attest some of our theoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 17:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

This implies that the spatial distribution of\nnon-interacting noninertial particles in such flows cannot develop density\ninhomogeneities beyond those that are already introduced in the initial\ncondition. However, in certain practical situations, density is measured or\naccumulated on (hyper-) surfaces of dimensionality lower than the full\ndimensionality of the flow in which the particles move. An example is the\nobservation of particle distributions sedimented on the floor of the ocean. In\nsuch cases, even if the initial distribution of noninertial particles is\nuniform within a finite support in an incompressible flow, advection in the\nflow will give rise to inhomogeneities in the observed density. In this paper\nwe analytically derive, in the framework of an initially homogeneous particle\nsheet sedimenting towards a bottom surface, the relationship between the\ngeometry of the flow and the emerging distribution. From a physical point of\nview, we identify the two processes that generate inhomogeneities to be the\nstretching within the sheet, and the projection of the deformed sheet onto the\ntarget surface. We point out that an extreme form of inhomogeneity, caustics,\ncan develop for sheets. We exemplify our geometrical results with simulations\nof particle advection in a simple kinematic flow, study the dependence on\nvarious parameters involved, and illustrate that the basic mechanisms work\nsimilarly if the initial (homogeneous) distribution occupies a more general\nregion of finite extension rather than a sheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 17:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 16:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Research on DIBs beyond the Local Group (LG) will\nsurely blossom in the era of the ELTs. A possibility that needs to be explored\nis the use of integral field spectrographs. We do so by using MUSE data for the\nAntennae Galaxy, the closest major galaxy merger. High S-to-N spectra were\ncreated by co-adding the signal of many spatial elements. The emission of the\nunderlying stellar population was modeled using STARLIGHT. To our knowledge, we\nhave derived the first maps for the DIBs at l5780 and l5797 in galaxies outside\nthe LG. The l5780 DIB was detected in an area of ~0.6 arcmin2, corresponding to\na linear scale of ~25 kpc2. This region was sampled using >200 independent\nlines of sight. The DIB l5797 was detected in >100 independent lines of sight.\nBoth DIBs are associated with a region with high emission in the HI 21 cm line,\nimplying a connection between atomic gas and DIBs, as the correlations for the\nMilky Way also suggest. Conversely, there is mild spatial association between\nthe two DIBs and the molecular gas, in agreement with results for our Galaxy\nthat indicate a lack of correlation between DIBs and molecular gas. The overall\nstructure for the DIB strength distribution and extinction are comparable.\nWithin the system, the l5780 DIB clearly correlates with the extinction. Both\nDIBs follow the relationship between equivalent width and reddening when data\nfor several galaxies are considered. Unidentified Infrared emission Bands\n(UIBs, likely caused by PAHs) and the l5780 and l5797 DIBs show similar but not\nidentical spatial distributions.

In this\npaper, we carry out a systematic comparison of the plasma conditions in\nFanaroff & Riley class I and II radio galaxies to demonstrate conclusively that\ntheir internal composition is systematically different. This difference is best\nexplained by the presence of an energetically dominant proton population in the\nFRI, but not the FRII radio galaxies.

Close quasar pairs\nand gravitationally lensed quasars have been used to circumvent this inherently\none-dimensional technique, but these objects are rare and the structure of the\ncircum-galactic medium remains poorly constrained. As a result, our\nunderstanding of the physical processes that drive the re-cycling of baryons\nacross the lifetime of a galaxy is limited.

We can thus coherently map the spatial and kinematic\ndistribution of Mg II absorption -a standard tracer of enriched gas- in an\nintervening galaxy system at redshift 0.98 (i.e., ~8 Gyr ago). Our\ngravitational-arc tomography unveils a clumpy medium in which the\nabsorption-strength decreases with increasing impact parameter, in good\nagreement with the statistics towards quasars; furthermore, we find strong\nevidence that the gas is not distributed isotropically.

For SMBHs with masses above $\\sim 10^7\nM_\\odot$, the tidal disruption of solar-type stars occurs within ten\ngravitational radii of the SMBH, implying that general relativity (GR) is\nneeded to describe gravity.

Most of the computational methods that have\nbeen proposed to predict DT interactions have focused on binary classification,\nwhere the goal is to determine whether a DT pair interacts or not. However,\nprotein-ligand interactions assume a continuum of binding strength values, also\ncalled binding affinity and predicting this value still remains a challenge.\nThe increase in the affinity data available in DT knowledge-bases allows the\nuse of advanced learning techniques such as deep learning architectures in the\nprediction of binding affinities. In this study, we propose a deep-learning\nbased model that uses only sequence information of both targets and drugs to\npredict DT interaction binding affinities.

We evaluate the\nmethod for the time period 2008-2012, and compare the results to a persistence\nmodel based on ACE in-situ measurements and to the STEREO persistence model\nwithout implementing the information on CH evolution. Compared to an ACE based\npersistence model, the performance of the STEREO persistence model which takes\ninto account the evolution of CHs, is able to increase the number of correctly\npredicted high-speed streams by about 12%, and to decrease the number of missed\nstreams by about 23%, and the number of false alarms by about 19%. However, the\nadded information on CH evolution is not able to deliver more accurate speed\nvalues for the forecast than using the STEREO persistence model without CH\ninformation which performs better than an ACE based persistence model.\nInvestigating the CH evolution between STEREO and Earth view for varying\nseparation angles over ~25-140{\\deg} East of Earth, we derive some relation\nbetween expanding CHs and increasing solar wind speed, but a less clear\nrelation for decaying CHs and decreasing solar wind speed. This fact most\nlikely prevents the method from making more precise forecasts. The obtained\nresults support a future L5 mission and show the importance and valuable\ncontribution using multi-viewpoint data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 20:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

CNNs require large\namounts of processing capacity and memory bandwidth. Hardware accelerators have\nbeen proposed for CNNs which typically contain large numbers of\nmultiply-accumulate (MAC) units, the multipliers of which are large in an\nintegrated circuit (IC) gate count and power consumption. \"Weight sharing\"\naccelerators have been proposed where the full range of weight values in a\ntrained CNN are compressed and put into bins and the bin index used to access\nthe weight-shared value. We reduce power and area of the CNN by implementing\nparallel accumulate shared MAC (PASM) in a weight shared CNN. PASM\nre-architects the MAC to instead count the frequency of each weight and place\nit in a bin. The accumulated value is computed in a subsequent multiply phase,\nsignificantly reducing gate count and power consumption of the CNN. In this\npaper, we implement PASM in a weight-shared CNN convolution hardware\naccelerator and analyze its effectiveness.

We present baseline results on the challenge of\npredicting emoji from both text and images, using state-of-the-art neural\nnetworks.

Finally, we present results for\nmultimedia retrieval using emoji as queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 23:19:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 14:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-05"}

Prior studies often derive knowledge from\nsuch models using interpretation techniques, such as ANOVA Type-I. Recent work\nraises concerns that prior studies rarely remove correlated metrics when\nconstructing such models. Such correlated metrics may impact the interpretation\nof models. Yet, the impact of correlated metrics in such models has not been\ninvestigated. In this paper, we set out to investigate the impact of correlated\nmetrics, and the benefits and costs of removing correlated metrics on defect\nmodels. Through a case study of 15 publicly-available defect datasets, we find\nthat (1) correlated metrics impact the ranking of the highest ranked metric for\nall of the 9 studied model interpretation techniques. On the other hand,\nremoving correlated metrics (2) improves the consistency of the highest ranked\nmetric regardless of how a model is specified for all of the studied\ninterpretation techniques (except for ANOVA Type-I); and (3) negligibly impacts\nthe performance and stability of defect models. Thus, researchers must (1)\nmitigate (e.g., remove) correlated metrics prior to constructing a defect\nmodel; and (2) avoid using ANOVA Type-I even if all correlated metrics are\nremoved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 01:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

This uses (in the converse direction) local compactness & bilocated\nsets as in [Ken15], but in the forward direction the newer version has a\nsimpler proof and no compactness assumption. Furthermore, the proof of the\nforward implication relates to so-called Dugundji systems: we elaborate both a\ngeneral construction of such systems for a proper nonempty closed subspace\n(using a computable form of countable paracompactness), and modifications -- to\nmake the sets pairwise disjoint if the subspace is zero-dimensional, or to\navoid the restriction to proper subspaces. In a different direction, a second\ntheorem applies in $p$-adic analysis the ideas of the first theorem to compute\na more general form of retraction, given a Dugundji system (possibly without\ndisjointness).\n  Finally, we complement the effective retract characterization of\nzero-dimensional subspaces mentioned above by improving to equivalence the\nimplications (or Weihrauch reductions in some cases), for closed\nat-most-zero-dimensional subsets with some negative information, among separate\nconditions of computability of operations $N,M,B,S$ introduced in [Ken15,\\S 4]\nand corresponding to vanishing large inductive dimension, vanishing small\ninductive dimension, existence of a countable basis of relatively clopen sets,\nand the reduction principle for sequences of open sets. Thus, similarly to the\nrobust notion of effective zero-dimensionality of computable metric spaces in\n[Ken15], there is a robust notion of `uniform effective zero-dimensionality'\nfor a represented pointclass consisting of at-most-zero-dimensional closed\nsubsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 02:32:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 14:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 04:55:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 08:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 03:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

The effective gauge fields\nimplemented by the intrinsic pseudo-spin-orbit interaction open up\ntopologically nontrivial bandgaps through the Dirac points.

The generalized gain-loss lattice with parity-time symmetry\ndecouples the gain and the loss at opposite zigzag edges, leading to purely\ngain or loss edge channels.

The recently proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nbased methods have shown good performance in learning spatio-temporal\nrepresentations for skeleton sequences. Despite the good recognition accuracy\nachieved by previous CNN based methods, there exist two problems that\npotentially limit the performance. First, previous skeleton representations are\ngenerated by chaining joints with a fixed order. The corresponding semantic\nmeaning is unclear and the structural information among the joints is lost.\nSecond, previous models do not have an ability to focus on informative joints.\nThe attention mechanism is important for skeleton based action recognition\nbecause there exist spatio-temporal key stages while the joint predictions can\nbe inaccurate. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel CNN based method\nfor skeleton based action recognition. We first redesign the skeleton\nrepresentations with a depth-first tree traversal order, which enhances the\nsemantic meaning of skeleton images and better preserves the associated\nstructural information. We then propose the idea of a two-branch attention\narchitecture that focuses on spatio-temporal key stages and filters out\nunreliable joint predictions. A base attention model with the simplest\nstructure is first introduced. By improving the structures in both branches, we\nfurther propose a Global Long-sequence Attention Network (GLAN).

One of the mostly concerned and\nunresolved problem is the \"lack of identifiability\" issue. With the presence of\nmodel discrepancy, inverse UQ becomes \"non-identifiable\" in the sense that it\nis difficult to precisely distinguish between the parameter uncertainties and\nmodel discrepancy when estimating the calibration parameters. Previous research\nto alleviate the non-identifiability issue focused on using informative priors\nfor the calibration parameters and the model discrepancy, which is usually not\na viable solution because one rarely has such accurate and informative prior\nknowledge.

Towards\nthis end, we introduce the task of Complex Sequential QA which combines the two\ntasks of (i) answering factual questions through complex inferencing over a\nrealistic-sized KG of millions of entities, and (ii) learning to converse\nthrough a series of coherently linked QA pairs.

Specifically, our dataset has questions which require\nlogical, quantitative, and comparative reasoning as well as their combinations.\nThis calls for models which can: (i) parse complex natural language questions,\n(ii) use conversation context to resolve coreferences and ellipsis in\nutterances, (iii) ask for clarifications for ambiguous queries, and finally\n(iv) retrieve relevant subgraphs of the KG to answer such questions.

Adding explicit constraints to avoid unsafe states is generally not\npossible when the state representations are complex. Furthermore, enforcing\nthese constraints during execution of the learned policy can be challenging in\nenvironments where dynamics are difficult to model such as push mechanics in\ngrasping. In this paper, we propose Derivative-Free Recovery (DFR), a two-phase\nmethod for generating robust policies from demonstrations in robotic\nmanipulation tasks where the system comes to rest at each time step. In the\nfirst phase, we use support estimation of supervisor demonstrations and treat\nthe support as implicit constraints on states. We also propose a time-varying\nmodification for sequential tasks. In the second phase, we use this support\nestimate to derive a switching policy that employs the learned policy in the\ninterior of the support and switches to a recovery policy to steer the robot\naway from the boundary of the support if it drifts too close.

Magnetic control includes a strong magnetic field,\nexchange bias, and field cooling, which are traditional and basic.

The construction uses a connection and bundles of covariant\ntensors to allow global transport of principal eigenvectors, and the model is\nthereby an example of how principal fiber bundles can be used to handle the\nlack of global coordinate system and orientations that characterizes manifold\nvalued statistics. We show how curvature implies non-integrability of the\nequivalent of Euclidean principal subspaces, and how the stochastic flows\nprovide an alternative to explicit construction of such subspaces. We describe\nestimation procedures for inference of parameters and prediction of principal\ncomponents, and we give examples of properties of the model on embedded\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 08:16:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 19:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Though efficient,\nsuch methods suffer from serious blocking artifacts. In this paper, we propose\na convolutional CS framework that senses the whole image using a set of\nconvolutional filters. Instead of reconstructing individual blocks, the whole\nimage is reconstructed from the linear convolutional measurements.\nSpecifically, the convolutional CS is implemented based on a convolutional\nneural network (CNN), which performs both the convolutional CS and nonlinear\nreconstruction. Through end-to-end training, the sensing filters and the\nreconstruction network can be jointly optimized. To facilitate the design of\nthe CS reconstruction network, a novel two-branch CNN inspired from a\nsparsity-based CS reconstruction model is developed.

This reveals\nthat the putative criticality of cortical dynamics does not correspond to a\nquiescent-to-active phase transition as usually assumed in theoretical\napproaches but to a synchronization phase transition, at which incipient\noscillations and scale-free avalanches coexist. Furthermore, our model also\naccounts for up and down states as they occur (e.g., during deep sleep).

Using representative evolutionary models\nof hot subdwarf stars, we demonstrate that angular momentum conservation in\nuniformly rotating strutures (rigid-body rotation) boosts that value of the\nprojected equatorial rotation speed by a factor $\\sim$3.6 by the time the model\nhas reached the region of the surface gravity-effective temperature plane where\nthe newly-studied post-EHB objects are found. This is exactly what is needed to\naccount for their observed atmospheric broadening. We note that the decrease of\nthe moment of inertia causing the spin-up is mostly due to the redistribution\nof matter that produces more centrally-condensed structures in the post-EHB\nphase of evolution, not to the decrease of the radius per se.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 09:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Energy-efficient noncoherent operation is achieved using multitone\nfrequency shift keying (FSK). A novel soft-output demodulator is developed for\nthe relay, and corresponding achievable exchange rates are found for Rayleigh\nfading and AWGN channels. Bit-error rate performance approaching the achievable\nrate is realized using a capacity-approaching channel code and a receiver\narchitecture that iterates between demodulation and channel decoding. Iterative\ndecoding is performed feeding information back from the channel decoder to the\ndemodulator. Additionally, error-rate performance is made to approach the\nachievable rate more closely by optimizing LDPC codes for this system. The\nenergy efficiency improvement obtained by increasing the modulation order is\nmore dramatic for the proposed physical-layer network coding scheme than it is\nfor a conventional point-to-point system. Using optimized LDPC codes, the\nbit-error rate performance is improved by as much as 1.1 dB over a widely known\nstandardized LDPC code, and comes to within 0.7 dB of the limit corresponding\nto the achievable rate.

Two popular methods for parameter\ninference for these models are MC-MLE (Monte Carlo maximum likelihood\nestimation), and NCE (noise contrastive estimation); both methods rely on\nsimulating artificial data-points to approximate the normalising constant.\nWhile the asymptotics of MC-MLE have been established under general hypotheses\n(Geyer, 1994), this is not so for NCE. We establish consistency and asymptotic\nnormality of NCE estimators under mild assumptions. We compare NCE and MC-MLE\nunder several asymptotic regimes. In particular, we show that, when m goes to\ninfinity while n is fixed (m and n being respectively the number of artificial\ndata-points, and actual data-points), the two estimators are asymptotically\nequivalent. Conversely, we prove that, when the artificial data-points are IID,\nand when n goes to infinity while m/n converges to a positive constant, the\nasymptotic variance of a NCE estimator is always smaller than the asymptotic\nvariance of the corresponding MC-MLE estimator.

The evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) in each galaxy is\ncomplex and diverse, characterized by bursts of star formation. Overall, first\ngalaxies spend 70% of their time in SF bursts. A sample of 1000 of these bursts\nindicates that the typical burst at z=6 has a specific SFR (sSFR) maximum of\n5-15 Gyr^-1 with an effective width of ~100 Myr, one tenth of the age of the\nUniverse at that redshift.

This oxygen supply can arise from a\nhigh background pressure in the vacuum system or from a purposely supplied gas.\nThe supply of oxygen makes it difficult to grow metallic nanoparticles of\ntitanium and can cause process problems by reacting with the target. We here\nreport that growth of titanium nanoparticles in the metallic hexagonal titanium\n({\\alpha}Ti) phase is possible using a pulsed hollow cathode sputter plasma and\nadding a high partial pressure of helium to the process instead of trace\namounts of oxygen. The helium cools the process gas in which the nanoparticles\nnucleate. This is important both for the first dimer formation and the\ncontinued growth to a thermodynamically stable size. The parameter region where\nthe synthesis of nanoparticles is possible is mapped out experimentally and the\ntheory of the physical processes behind this process window is outlined. A\npressure limit below which no nanoparticles were produced was found at 200 Pa,\nand could be attributed to a low dimer formation rate, mainly caused by a more\nrapid dilution of the growth material. Nanoparticle production also disappeared\nat argon gas flows above 25 sccm. In this case the main reason was identified\nas a gas temperature increase within the nucleation zone, giving a too high\nevaporation rate from nanoparticles (clusters) in the stage of growth from\ndimers to stable nuclei. These two mechanisms are in depth explored in a\ncompanion paper [1]. A process stability limit was also found at low argon gas\npartial pressures, and could be attributed to a transition from a hollow\ncathode discharge to a glow discharge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 10:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 17:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The addition of\nimpurities, such as oxygen or water, facilitates this and allows the growth of\nnanoparticles. However, it seems that this route requires so high oxygen\ndensities that metallic nanoparticles in the hexagonal aTi-phase cannot be\nsynthesized. Here we present a model which explains results for the nucleation\nand growth of titanium nanoparticles in the absent of reactive impurities. In\nthese experiments, a high partial pressure of helium gas was added which\nincreased the cooling rate of the process gas in the region where nucleation\noccurred. This is important for two reasons. First, a reduced gas temperature\nenhances Ti2 dimer formation mainly because a lower gas temperature gives a\nhigher gas density, which reduces the dilution of the Ti vapor through\ndiffusion. The same effect can be achieved by increasing the gas pressure.\nSecond, a reduced gas temperature has a \"more than exponential\" effect in\nlowering the rate of atom evaporation from the nanoparticles during their\ngrowth from a dimer to size where they are thermodynamically stable, r*. We\nshow that this early stage evaporation is not possible to model as a\nthermodynamical equilibrium. Instead, the single-event nature of the\nevaporation process has to be considered. This leads, counter intuitively, to\nan evaporation probability from nanoparticles that is exactly zero below a\ncritical nanoparticle temperature that is size-dependent. Together, the\nmechanisms described above explain two experimentally found limits for\nnucleation in an oxygen-free environment. First, there is a lower limit to the\npressure for dimer formation.

For example, it\nhas long been known that under the Yule model, a pure birth process, imbalanced\ntrees are more likely than balanced ones. Also, concerning ordered search\ntrees, more balanced ones allow for more efficient data structuring than\nimbalanced ones. Therefore, different methods to measure the balance of trees\nwere introduced. The Sackin index is one of the most frequently used measures\nfor this purpose. In many contexts, statements about the minimal and maximal\nvalues of this index have been discussed, but formal proofs have only been\nprovided for some of them, and only in the context of ordered binary (search)\ntrees, not for general rooted trees. Moreover, while the number of trees with\nmaximal Sackin index as well as the number of trees with minimal Sackin index\nwhen the number of leaves is a power of 2 are relatively easy to understand,\nthe number of trees with minimal Sackin index for all other numbers of leaves\nhas been completely unknown.

However, our 3D hydrodynamic\nsupercomputer simulations, coupled with a non-linear diffusive shock\nacceleration model (NLDSA), provide evidence that eqp may be established at the\nend of the Sedov phase of evolution in which most SNRs spend the longest\nportions of their lives. We introduce term \"constant partition\" for any\nconstant ratio between the CR energy density and the energy density of magnetic\nfield in an SNR, while term \"equipartition\" should be reserved for the case of\napproximately the same values of the energy density (also, it is {constant\npartition} in the order of magnitude) of ultrarelativistic electrons only (or\nCRs in total) and the energy density of magnetic field. Our simulations suggest\nthat this approximate constant partition does exist in all but the youngest\nSNRs. We speculate that since evolved SNRs at the end of the Sedov phase of\nevolution can reach eqp between CRs and magnetic fields, they may be\nresponsible for initializing this type of eqp in the interstellar medium.\nAdditionally, we show that eqp between the electron component of CRs and\nmagnetic field may be used for calculating the magnetic field strength directly\nfrom observations of synchrotron emission from SNRs.

However, the effective resolution of FTI is\nlimited by the durability of biological elements when exposed to illuminating\nlight. Overexposed elements are subject to photo-bleaching and become unable to\nfluoresce. In this context, the acquisition of biological HS volumes based on\nsampling the Optical Path Difference (OPD) axis at Nyquist rate leads to\nunpleasant trade-offs between spectral resolution, quality of the HS volume,\nand light exposure intensity. We propose two variants of the FTI imager, i.e.,\nCoded Illumination-FTI (CI-FTI) and Structured Illumination FTI (SI-FTI), based\non the theory of compressive sensing (CS). These schemes efficiently modulate\nlight exposure temporally (in CI-FTI) or spatiotemporally (in SI-FTI).\nLeveraging a variable density sampling strategy recently introduced in CS, we\nprovide near-optimal illumination strategies, so that the light exposure\nimposed on a biological specimen is minimized while the spectral resolution is\npreserved. Our analysis focuses on two criteria: (i) a trade-off between\nexposure intensity and the quality of the reconstructed HS volume for a given\nspectral resolution; (ii) maximizing HS volume quality for a fixed spectral\nresolution and constrained exposure budget. Our contributions can be adapted to\nan FTI imager without hardware modifications. The reconstruction of HS volumes\nfrom CS-FTI measurements relies on an $l_1$-norm minimization problem promoting\na spatiospectral sparsity prior.

The key idea is to rank the filters based on a certain criterion\n(say, $l_1$-norm, average percentage of zeros, etc) and retain only the top\nranked filters. Once the low scoring filters are pruned away the remainder of\nthe network is fine tuned and is shown to give performance comparable to the\noriginal unpruned network. In this work, we report experiments which suggest\nthat the comparable performance of the pruned network is not due to the\nspecific criterion chosen but due to the inherent plasticity of deep neural\nnetworks which allows them to recover from the loss of pruned filters once the\nrest of the filters are fine-tuned. Specifically, we show counter-intuitive\nresults wherein by randomly pruning 25-50\\% filters from deep CNNs we are able\nto obtain the same performance as obtained by using state of the art pruning\nmethods. We empirically validate our claims by doing an exhaustive evaluation\nwith VGG-16 and ResNet-50. Further, we also evaluate a real world scenario\nwhere a CNN trained on all 1000 ImageNet classes needs to be tested on only a\nsmall set of classes at test time (say, only animals). We create a new\nbenchmark dataset from ImageNet to evaluate such class specific pruning and\nshow that even here a random pruning strategy gives close to state of the art\nperformance. Lastly, unlike existing approaches which mainly focus on the task\nof image classification, in this work we also report results on object\ndetection. We show that using a simple random pruning strategy we can achieve\nsignificant speed up in object detection (74$\\%$ improvement in fps) while\nretaining the same accuracy as that of the original Faster RCNN model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 13:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity.

For the two-dimensional unsteady Prandtl\nboundary layer equations, when the initial tangential velocity is strictly\nmonotonic with respect to the normal variable, and the pressure gradient of the\nouter flow is adverse, we obtain that the first critical point of the\ntangential velocity profile with respect to the normal variable, if exists when\nthe boundary layer evolves in time, must appear on the boundary. Moreover, we\ngive a condition on the growth rate of the initial tangential velocity such\nthat there is a back flow point of the Prandtl boundary layer under the adverse\npressure gradient.

We\nobtain the ground state phase diagram using the density matrix renormalization\ngroup method and compute various ground state quantities like the\nmagnetization, staggered magnetization, electric polarization and spin\ncorrelation functions, etc. In the presence of both longitudinal and transverse\nmagnetic fields, there are three different phases corresponding to a gapped\nN\\'{e}el phase with antiferromagnetic (AF) order, gapped saturated phase and a\ncritical incommensurate gapless phase. The external electric field modifies the\nphase boundaries but does not lead to any new phases. Both external magnetic\nfields and electric fields can be used to tune between the phases. We also show\nthat the transverse magnetic field induces a vector chiral order in the\nN\\'{e}el phase (even in the absence of an electric field) which can be\ninterpreted as an electric polarization in a direction parallel to the AF\norder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 15:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

Aims: We want to understand the magnetic field properties at the\nearliest evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation. Methods: The Atacama\nLarge Millimeter Array is used at 1.3mm wavelength in full polarization mode to\nstudy the polarized emission and by that the magnetic field morphologies and\nstrengths of the high-mass starless region IRDC18310-4. Results: The polarized\nemission is clearly detected in four sub-cores of the region. In general it\nshows a smooth distribution, also along elongated cores. Estimating the\nmagnetic field strength via the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and following\na structure function analysis, we find comparably large magnetic field\nstrengths between ~0.6 and 3.7mG. Comparing the data to spectral line\nobservations, the turbulent-to-magnetic energy ratio is low, indicating that\nturbulence does not significantly contribute to the stability of the gas clump.\nA mass-to-flux ratio around the critical value 1.0 - depending on column\ndensity - indicates that the region starts to collapse which is consistent with\nthe previous spectral line analysis of the region. Conclusions: While this\nhigh-mass region is collapsing and thus at the verge of star formation, the\nhigh magnetic field values and the smooth spatial structure indicate that the\nmagnetic field is important for the fragmentation and collapse process. This\nsingle case study can only be the starting point for larger sample studies of\nmagnetic fields at the onset of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 14:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Traditional misuse detection strategies are unable\nto detect new and unknown intrusion types.

Anomaly detection can be considered as a\nclassification problem where it builds models of normal network behavior, of\nwhich it uses to detect new patterns that significantly deviate from the model.\nMost of the current approaches on anomaly detection is based on the learning of\nnormal behavior and anomalous actions.

After a certain\nnumber of samples are generated, if no solution is found, we increase the\ndimension of the search subspace by one and continue sampling in the higher\ndimensional subspace. In the worst case, the search subspace expands to include\nthe full configuration space - making the completeness properties identical to\nthe underlying sampling-based planer. Our experiments comparing the enhanced\nand traditional version of RRT, RRT-Connect, and BidirectionalT-RRT on both a\nplanar hyper-redundant manipulator and the Baxter humanoid robot indicate that\na solution is typically found much faster using this approach and the run time\nappears to be less sensitive to the dimension of the full configuration space.\nWe explore important implementation issues in the sampling process and discuss\nits limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 22:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

Small errors in state estimation propagate\nto make odometry virtually unusable in a matter of seconds.

Let $\\hat{\\Pi}$ be the\ndecision problem associated with $\\Pi(X,\\gamma)$. A sub-solution of\n$\\Pi(X,\\gamma)$ is a subset $Y'$ that is a solution of the problem\n$\\Pi(X',\\gamma)$, where $X' \\subset X$. To $\\Pi(X,\\gamma)$ we associate the set\nsystem $(X, \\mathcal{I})$, where $\\mathcal{I}$ denotes the set of all the\nsolutions and sub-solutions of $\\Pi(X,\\gamma)$.\n  The predicate $\\gamma$ is an accessible predicate if, given $Y \\not =\n\\emptyset$, $Y$ is a solution of $\\Pi(X,\\gamma)$ implies that there is an\nelement $y \\in Y$ such that $Y \\setminus y$ is a sub-solution of\n$\\Pi(X,\\gamma)$. If $\\gamma$ is an accessible property, we then show in Theorem\n1 that a decision problem $\\hat \\Pi$ is in $\\mathcal{P}$ if and only if, for\nall input $X$, $(X, \\mathcal{I})$ satisfies Axioms M2', where M2', called the\nAugmentability Axiom, is an extension of both the Exchange Axiom and the\nAccessibility Axiom of a greedoid. We also show that a problem $\\hat \\Pi$ is in\n$\\mathcal{P}$-complete if and only if, for all input $X$, $(X, \\mathcal{I})$\nsatisfies Axioms M2' and M1, where M1 is the Heredity Axiom of a matroid. A\nproblem $\\hat \\Pi$ is in $\\mathcal{NP}$ if and only if , for all input $X$,\n$(X, \\mathcal{I})$ satisfies Axioms M2\", where M2\" is an extension of the\nAugmentability Axiom. Finally, the problem $\\hat \\Pi$ is in\n$\\mathcal{NP}$-complete if and only if, for all input $X$, $(X, \\mathcal{I})$\nsatisfies Axiom M1.\n  Using the fact that Hamiltonicity is an accessible property that satisfies\nM2\", but does not satisfies Axiom M2', in Corollary 1 we get that $\\mathcal{P}\n\\not = \\mathcal{NP}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 22:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 10:11:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 19:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}
