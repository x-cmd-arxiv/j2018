Layers represent\ndirect financial exposures of various types, including interbank liabilities,\nderivative- or foreign exchange exposures. Another network layer of systemic\nrisk emerges through common asset holdings of financial institutions. Strongly\noverlapping portfolios lead to similar exposures that are caused by price\nmovements of the underlying financial assets. Based on the knowledge of\nportfolio holdings of financial agents we quantify systemic risk of overlapping\nportfolios. We present an optimization procedure, where we minimize the\nsystemic risk in a given financial market by optimally rearranging overlapping\nportfolio networks, under the constraints that the expected returns and risks\nof the individual portfolios are unchanged. We explicitly demonstrate the power\nof the method on the overlapping portfolio network of sovereign exposure\nbetween major European banks by using data from the European Banking Authority\nstress test of 2016. We show that systemic-risk-efficient allocations are\naccessible by the optimization. In the case of sovereign exposure, systemic\nrisk can be reduced by more than a factor of two, with- out any detrimental\neffects for the individual banks. These results are confirmed by a simple\nsimulation of fire sales in the government bond market. In particular we show\nthat the contagion probability is reduced dramatically in the optimized\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 16:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 09:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

This is important for planetary habitability\nbecause snowball events may trigger rises in the complexity of life, but could\nalso endanger complex life that already exists. Recent work has shown that\nplanets tidally locked in synchronous rotation states will transition smoothly\ninto the snowball state rather than experiencing bifurcations. Here we\ninvestigate the structure of snowball bifurcations on planets that are tidally\ninfluenced, but not synchronously rotating, so that they experience long solar\ndays. We use PlaSIM, an intermediate-complexity global climate model, with a\nthermodynamic mixed layer ocean and the Sun's spectrum. We find that the amount\nof hysteresis (range in stellar flux for which there is bistability in climate)\nis significantly reduced for solar days with lengths of tens of Earth days, and\ndisappears for solar days of hundreds of Earth days. These results suggest that\ntidally influenced planets orbiting M and K-stars that are not synchronously\nrotating could have much less hysteresis associated with the snowball\nbifurcations than they would if they were rapidly rotating. This implies that\nthe amount of time it takes them to escape a snowball state via CO$_2$\noutgassing would be greatly reduced, as would the period of cycling between the\nwarm and snowball state if they have a low CO$_2$ outgassing rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

In this paper, we propose confidence intervals for\nindividual loadings and for the largest eigenvalue of the population covariance\nmatrix. Given an independent sample $X^i \\in\\mathbb R^p, i = 1,...,n,$\ngenerated from an unknown distribution with an unknown covariance matrix\n$\\Sigma_0$, our aim is to estimate the first vector of loadings and the largest\neigenvalue of $\\Sigma_0$ in a setting where $p\\gg n$.

We introduce a new design paradigm for\ntime-modulated metasurfaces, offering electrically tunable engineering of the\ngenerated frequency harmonics and their emerging wavefronts by controlling the\nphase delay in modulation. It is demonstrated that the light acquires a\ndispersionless phase shift regardless of incident angle and polarization, upon\nundergoing frequency conversion in a time-modulated metasurface which is\nlinearly proportional to the modulation phase delay and the order of generated\nfrequency harmonic. The conversion efficiency to the frequency harmonics is\nindependent of modulation phase delay and only depends on the modulation depth\nand resonant characteristics of the metasurface element, with the highest\nefficiency occurring in the vicinity of resonance, and decreasing away from the\nresonant regime. The design approach allows for creating tunable spatially\nvarying phase discontinuties with 2{\\pi} span in the wavefronts of generated\nfrequency harmonics for a wide range of frequencies and incident angles.\nSpecifically, we apply this approach to a time-modulated metasurface in the\nTeraherz regime consisted of graphene-wrapped silicon microwires.

We study this effective free energy in the vicinity of the\ndynamical quantum phase transition by performing an expansion in terms of the\ncomplex magnetization and discuss the connections to the equilibrium case.\nFurthermore, we study the influence of perturbations and signatures of these\ndynamical quantum phase transitions in spin correlation functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 19:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 09:24:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

Shopping malls offer an open, safe and democratic\nversion of the public space. Many of their detractors suggest that malls target\ntheir customers in subtle ways, promoting social exclusion. In this work, we\nanalyze whether malls offer opportunities for social mixing by analyzing the\npatterns of shopping mall visits in a large Latin-American city: Santiago de\nChile.\n  We use a large XDR (Data Detail Records) dataset from a telecommunication\ncompany to analyze the mobility of $387,152$ cell phones around $16$ large\nmalls in Santiago de Chile during one month. We model the influx of people to\nmalls in terms of a gravity model of mobility, and we are able to predict the\ncustomer profile distribution of each mall, explaining it in terms of mall\nlocation, the population distribution, and mall size.\n  Then, we analyze the concept of social attraction, expressed as people from\nlow and middle classes being attracted by malls that target high-income\ncustomers. We include a social attraction factor in our model and find that it\nis negligible in the process of choosing a mall. We observe that social mixing\narises only in peripheral malls located farthest from the city center, which\nboth low and middle class people visit. Using a co-visitation model we show\nthat people tend to choose a restricted profile of malls according to their\nsocio-economic status and their distance from the mall. We conclude that the\npotential for social mixing in malls could be capitalized by designing public\npolicies regarding transportation and mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 19:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 16:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

Additionally, Henge allows each\ntenant (job) to specify its own intents (i.e., requirements) as a Service Level\nObjective (SLO) that captures latency and/or throughput. In a multi-tenant\ncluster, the Henge scheduler adapts continually to meet jobs' SLOs in spite of\nlimited cluster resources, and under dynamic input workloads. SLOs are soft and\nare based on utility functions. Henge continually tracks SLO satisfaction, and\nwhen jobs miss their SLOs, it wisely navigates the state space to perform\nresource allocations in real time, maximizing total system utility achieved by\nall jobs in the system.

Although black holes with these masses cannot\nbe formed as a result of stellar evolution, they may have formed in the early\nUniverse and are therefore called Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Previous\nsearches for PBHs have focused on either short timescale bursts or the\ncontribution of PBHs to the isotropic gamma-ray emission. We show that, in case\nof individual PBHs, the Fermi LAT is most sensitive to PBHs with temperatures\nabove approximately 16 GeV and masses $6\\times 10^{11}$ g, which it can detect\nout to a distance of about 0.03 pc. These PBHs have a remaining lifetime of\nmonths to years at the start of the Fermi mission. They would appear as\npotentially moving point sources with gamma-ray emission that becomes\nspectrally harder and brighter with time until the PBH completely evaporates.\nIn this paper, we develop a new algorithm to detect the proper motion of a\ngamma-ray point sources, and apply it to 318 unassociated point sources at high\ngalactic latitude in the third Fermi-LAT source catalog (3FGL). None of\nunassociated point sources with spectra consistent with PBH evaporation show\nsignificant proper motion. Using the non-detection of PBH candidates, we derive\na 99\\% confidence limit on PBH evaporation rate in the vicinity of the Earth\n$\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm PBH} < 7.2 \\times 10^3\\: {\\rm {pc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}}$.

The subject of interest in this work is the d-band metal gold which\nhas an absorption edge marking the transition of free valence electrons and an\nabsorbing deep d-band with bound electrons. Reflectivity changes are observed\nin experiment over a broad spectral range at ablation conditions. To understand\nthe involved processes the laser excitation is modeled by a com- bination of\nfirst principle calculations with a two-temperature model.

Our numerical results are\ncompared to data and those from factorization approach. The quality of the fit\nis improved significantly from the factorization results in the presence of\nrescattering. The relations on topological amplitudes and rescattering are\nexplored and they help to provide a better understanding of the effects of FSI.\nAs suggested by U(3) symmetry on topological amplitudes and FSI, a vanishing\nexchange rescattering scenario is considered. The exchange, annihilation,\n$u$-penguin, $u$-penguin annihilation and some electroweak penguin amplitudes\nare enhanced significantly via annihilation and total annihilation\nrescatterings. In particular, the $u$-penguin annihilation amplitude is sizably\nenhanced by the tree amplitude via total annihilation rescattering. These\nenhancements affect rates and CP asymmetries. Predictions can be checked in the\nnear future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 05:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 15:57:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

If the\ntransition probability is $p$ in the forward process, then classical intuition\nsuggests that the probability to return to the initial state after the backward\nprocess should be $p^2$.

Though the security has\nbeen studied in a number of works, the joint optimization of the physical layer\nsecurity and the end-to-end delay management, which requires a meticulous\ncross-layer design, has seldom been evaluated. In this work, by combining the\ntools from stochastic geometry and queueing theory, we analyze the tradeoff\nbetween the delay and the security performance in large wireless networks.

Our numerical results reveal that the security performance is\nbetter for larger path loss exponent when the density of legitimate nodes is\nlarge, and it is reverse when the density is small. Moreover, it is observed\nthat by introducing the simple mechanism of message split, the security\nperformance is greatly improved in the backlogged scenario and slightly\nimproved in the dynamic scenario when the density of legitimate transmitters is\nlarge. In summary, this work provides an understanding and a rule-of-thumb for\nthe practical design of wireless networks where both the delay and the security\nare key concerns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 08:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

PoLU adopts several advantages of previously proposed activation\nfunctions. First, the output of PoLU for positive inputs is designed to be\nidentity to avoid the gradient vanishing problem. Second, PoLU has a non-zero\noutput for negative inputs such that the output mean of the units is close to\nzero, hence reducing the bias shift effect. Thirdly, there is a saturation on\nthe negative part of PoLU, which makes it more noise-robust for negative\ninputs. Furthermore, we prove that PoLU is able to map more portions of every\nlayer's input to the same space by using the power function and thus increases\nthe number of response regions of the neural network. We use image\nclassification for comparing our proposed activation function with others. In\nthe experiments, MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Street View House Numbers (SVHN)\nand ImageNet are used as benchmark datasets. The neural networks we implemented\ninclude widely-used ELU-Network, ResNet-50, and VGG16, plus a couple of shallow\nnetworks.

Although the degenerate sequence can be\nwell fitted employing the most up-to-date theoretical cooling sequences,\nobservations show a systematic excess of red objects that cannot be explained\nby the theoretical models of single carbon-oxygen white dwarfs of the\nappropriate masses. Here we present a population synthesis study of the white\ndwarf cooling sequence of the Galactic bulge that takes into account the\npopulations of both single white dwarfs and binary systems containing at least\none white dwarf. These calculations incorporate state-of-the-art cooling\nsequences for white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-deficient\natmospheres, for both white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen and helium cores, and\nalso take into account detailed prescriptions of the evolutionary history of\nbinary systems. Our Monte Carlo simulator also incorporates all the known\nobservational biases. This allows us to model with a high degree of realism the\nwhite dwarf population of the Galactic bulge. We find that the observed excess\nof red stars can be partially attributed to white dwarf plus main sequence\nbinaries, and to cataclysmic variables or dwarf novae. Our best fit is obtained\nwith a higher binary fraction and an initial mass function slope steeper than\nstandard values, as well as with the inclusion of differential reddening and\nblending.

While\nits positive aspects make the cloud extremely attractive for data storage, it\nis a relatively new area of service, making it vulnerable to cyber-attacks and\nsecurity breaches. Storing data in a foreign location also requires the owner\nto relinquish control of their information to system administrators of these\nonline database services.

The retention of the data as it was intended to be stored is referred to\nas the database's integrity. Our research tests a potential solution for\nmaintaining the integrity of these cloud-storage databases by converting the\noriginal databases to Integrity Coded Databases (ICDB). ICDBs utilize Integrity\nCodes: cryptographic codes created alongside the data by a private key that\nonly the data owner has access to. When the database is queried, an integrity\ncode is returned along with the queried information. The owner is then able to\nverify that the information is correct, complete, and fresh. Consequently,\nICDBs also incur performance and memory penalties. In our research, we explore,\ntest, and benchmark ICDBs to determine the costs and benefits of maintaining an\nICDB versus a standard database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 10:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

Recently, several conditional\nGenerative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based methods have achieved great success.\nThey can generate images fitting the real face distributions conditioned on\neach individual age group. However, these methods fail to capture the\ntransition patterns, e.g., the gradual shape and texture changes between\nadjacent age groups. In this paper, we propose a novel Contextual Generative\nAdversarial Nets (C-GANs) to specifically take it into consideration. The\nC-GANs consists of a conditional transformation network and two discriminative\nnetworks. The conditional transformation network imitates the aging procedure\nwith several specially designed residual blocks. The age discriminative network\nguides the synthesized face to fit the real conditional distribution. The\ntransition pattern discriminative network is novel, aiming to distinguish the\nreal transition patterns with the fake ones. It serves as an extra\nregularization term for the conditional transformation network, ensuring the\ngenerated image pairs to fit the corresponding real transition pattern\ndistribution.

There is\ngenerally a time delay (i.e., so-called {\\it delayed feedback}) between the ad\nclick and conversion. Owing to the delayed feedback, samples that are converted\nafter an observation period may be treated as negative. To overcome this\ndrawback, CVR prediction assuming that the time delay follows an exponential\ndistribution has been proposed. In practice, however, there is no guarantee\nthat the delay is generated from the exponential distribution, and the best\ndistribution with which to represent the delay depends on the data. In this\npaper, we propose a nonparametric delayed feedback model for CVR prediction\nthat represents the distribution of the time delay without assuming a\nparametric distribution, such as an exponential or Weibull distribution.\nBecause the distribution of the time delay is modeled depending on the content\nof an ad and the features of a user, various shapes of the distribution can be\nrepresented potentially. In experiments, we show that the proposed model can\ncapture the distribution for the time delay on a synthetic dataset, even when\nthe distribution is complicated.

The agents are\nendowed with a bag of resources and try to achieve a resource objective. For\neach agent, an action consists in making available a part of their endowed\nresources. All the resources made available can be used towards the agents'\nobjectives. We study three decision problems, the first of which is deciding\nwhether an action profile is a Nash equilibrium: when all the agents have\nchosen an action, it is a Nash Equilibrium if no agent has an incentive to\nchange their action unilaterally. When dealing with resources, interesting\nquestions arise as to whether some equilibria can be eliminated or constructed\nby a central authority by redistributing the available resources among the\nagents. In our economies, division of property in divorce law exemplifies how a\ncentral authority can redistribute the resources of individuals and why they\nwould desire to do so. We thus study two related decision problems: (i)\nrational elimination: given an action profile's outcome, can the endowed\nresources be redistributed so that it is not the outcome of a Nash equilibrium?\n(ii) Rational construction: given an action profile's outcome, can the endowed\nresources be redistributed so that it is the outcome of a Nash equilibrium?\nAmong other results, we prove that all three problems are PSPACE-complete when\nthe resources are described in the very expressive language of the\npropositional multiplicative and additive linear logic. We also identify a new\nmodest fragment of linear logic that we call MULT, suitable to represent\nmultisets and reason about the inclusion and equality of bags of resources.

It is found that the results by\nmeans of SWC are obviously different to the results from the APBC or PBC.\nAlthough the three boundary conditions give the same chiral crossover\ntransition curve in the infinite volume limit, the limit size $L_0$ (when\n$L\\geq L_{0}$, the chiral quark condensate $-\\left\\langle { \\bar \\psi \\psi}\n\\right\\rangle_L$ is indistinguishable from that at $L=\\infty$) using SWC is\n$L_0\\approx 500$ fm which is much larger than the results obtained using APBC\nor PBC.

We also suggest that\nthe site of particle accelerations in relativistic jets can be constrained by\nfitting the radio images to observations.

A\nmajor reason for the bottleneck is that data stored within DRAM must be moved\nacross a pin-limited memory channel to the CPU before any computation can take\nplace. This requires a high latency and energy overhead, and the data often\ncannot benefit from caching in the CPU, making it difficult to amortize the\noverhead.\n  Modern 3D-stacked DRAM architectures include a logic layer, where compute\nlogic can be integrated underneath multiple layers of DRAM cell arrays within\nthe same chip. Architects can take advantage of the logic layer to perform\nprocessing-in-memory (PIM), or near-data processing. In a PIM architecture, the\nlogic layer within DRAM has access to the high internal bandwidth available\nwithin 3D-stacked DRAM (which is much greater than the bandwidth available\nbetween DRAM and the CPU). Thus, PIM architectures can effectively free up\nvaluable memory channel bandwidth while reducing system energy consumption.\n  A number of important issues arise when we add compute logic to DRAM. In\nparticular, the logic does not have low-latency access to common CPU structures\nthat are essential for modern application execution, such as the virtual memory\nand cache coherence mechanisms. To ease the widespread adoption of PIM, we\nideally would like to maintain traditional virtual memory abstractions and the\nshared memory programming model. This requires efficient mechanisms that can\nprovide logic in DRAM with access to CPU structures without having to\ncommunicate frequently with the CPU. To this end, we propose and evaluate two\ngeneral-purpose solutions that minimize unnecessary off-chip communication for\nPIM architectures. We show that both mechanisms improve the performance and\nenergy consumption of many important memory-intensive applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 15:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

A\nsystematic approach to measure pairwise functional distance at different brain\nstates is lacking. This would provide a straight-forward way to quantify\ndifferences in cognitive processing across tasks; also, it would help in\nrelating these differences in task-based FCs to the underlying structural\nnetwork.

The approach is based on\nfirst obtaining stability and $L_1/\\ell_1$-to-$L_1/\\ell_1$ performance analysis\nconditions for uncertain linear positive impulsive systems in linear fractional\nform with norm-bounded uncertainties using a scaled small-gain argument\ninvolving time-varying $D$-scalings. Both range and minimum dwell-time\nconditions are formulated -- the case of constant and maximum dwell-times can\nbe directly obtained as corollaries. The conditions are stated as\ntimer/clock-dependent conditions taking the form of infinite-dimensional linear\nprograms that can be relaxed into finite-dimensional ones using polynomial\noptimization techniques. It is notably shown that under certain conditions, the\nscalings can be eliminated from the stability conditions to yield equivalent\nstability conditions on the so-called \"worst-case system\", which is obtained by\nreplacing the uncertainties by the identity matrix. These conditions are then\napplied to the special case of linear positive systems with delays, where the\ndelays are considered as uncertainties. As before, under certain conditions,\nthe scalings can be eliminated from the conditions to obtain conditions on the\nworst-case system, coinciding here with the zero-delay system -- a result that\nis consistent with all the existing ones in the literature on linear positive\nsystems with delays.

Therefore we first reconstruct the\nfull process theoretic description of quantum theory, consisting of composite\nclassical-quantum systems and their interactions, before restricting ourselves\nto just the `fully quantum' systems as the final step. We propose two novel\nalternative manners of doing so, `no-leaking' (roughly that information gain\ncauses disturbance) and `purity of cups' (roughly the existence of entangled\nstates).

The resultant probabilistic\nmodels assume that the underlying random variables, which define a measurable\nset of outcomes, can be defined independent of the measurement context. The\nphenomenon is deemed contextual when this assumption fails. Contextuality is an\nimportant issue in quantum physics. However, there has been growing speculation\nthat it manifests outside the quantum realm with human cognition being a\nparticularly prominent area of investigation. This article contributes the\nfoundations of a probabilistic programming language that allows convenient\nexploration of contextuality in wide range of applications relevant to\ncognitive science and artificial intelligence. Specific syntax is proposed to\nallow the specification of \"measurement contexts\". Each such context delivers a\npartial model of the phenomenon based on the associated experimental condition\ndescribed by the measurement context. The probabilistic program is translated\ninto a hypergraph in a modular way. Recent theoretical results from the field\nof quantum physics show that contextuality can be equated with the possibility\nof constructing a probabilistic model on the resulting hypergraph. The use of\nhypergraphs opens the door for a theoretically succinct and efficient\ncomputational semantics sensitive to modelling both contextual and\nnon-contextual phenomena. Finally, this article raises awareness of\ncontextuality beyond quantum physics and to contribute formal methods to detect\nits presence by means of hypergraph semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 22:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-05"}

This way each category can be represented as a point in the\nstates space [0.1]**N. The introduction of a diffeomorphism, that acts in this\ncontext as a functor between categories, allows to define a measure preserving\ndynamical system. In particular, we apply this formalism to describe a living\nsingle cell. We propose for its state at a given time a hirerchical category\nwith three levels (molecular, coarse-grained and cellular levels) related by\nadequate colimits. Each level involves the main functional and structural\nmodules in which the cell can be partitioned. The time evolution of the cell is\ndrived by a transformation which is a N-dimensional generalization of the\nRicker map whose parameters we propose to be determined by requiring that, as\nhallmark of its behavior, the living cell to evolve at the edge of chaos. From\nthe dynamical point of view this property manifests in the fact that the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero. Since in a rather complete model of\nthe living cell the huge number of involved parameters can make of the\ncalculations a hard task, we also propose a toy model, with fewer parameters to\nbe determined, which emphasizes the cellular fission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

We denote the\nnumbers of equivalence classes with respect to $\\simeq_r$ contained in\n$\\binom{X}{2}$ and $\\binom{X}{3}$ by $a_2(r)$ and $a_3(r)$, respectively. In\nthis paper we prove that $a_2(r)\\leq a_3(r)$ when $5\\leq |X|$, and show what\nhappens when the equality holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 14:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}
