In this paper we proposed a polyp\nsegmentation method based on convolutional neural network. Performance of the\nmethod is enhanced by two strategies.

Detecting these in astronomical spectra is difficult due to the\nstrong contamination of ground-based spectra by atmospheric water vapor, to the\npresence of weak and shallow stellar lines and/or blending with other weak\nDIBs. The detection of the two strong bands has been claimed by several teams,\nand the three additional and weaker bands have been detected in a few sources.\nCertain recent papers have argued against the identification of C60+ based on\nspectral analyses claiming (i) a large variation in the ratio between the\nequivalent widths of the 9632 and 9577\\AA\\: bands, (ii) a large redshift of the\n9632\\AA\\: band for the Orion star HD 37022, and (iii) the non-detection of the\nweaker 9428\\AA~DIB.

Alternative regularizing definitions that are\nindeed smooth and monotonic, are introduced. These new definitions lead to\nsmooth Heaviside functions by taking the changing local meshsize into account.\nThe second issue is the computational cost and fragility caused by the\nnecessity of redistancing the level-set field.

Four alternative approaches for circumventing the expensive redistancing\nstep are proposed.

For polynomial SHSs -- which\nconsist of polynomial continuous vector fields, reset maps, and transition\nintensities -- the dynamics of moments evolve according to a system of linear\nordinary differential equations. However, it is generally not possible to solve\nthe system exactly since time evolution of a specific moment may depend upon\nmoments of order higher than it. One way to overcome this problem is to employ\nso-called moment closure methods that give point approximations to moments, but\nthese are limited in that accuracy of the estimations is unknown. We find lower\nand upper bounds on a moment of interest via a semidefinite program that\nincludes linear constraints obtained from moment dynamics, along with\nsemidefinite constraints that arise from the non-negativity of moment matrices.\nThese bounds are further shown to improve as the size of semidefinite program\nis increased. The key insight in the method is a reduction from stochastic\nhybrid systems with multiple discrete modes to a single-mode hybrid system with\nalgebraic constraints. We further extend the scope of the proposed method to a\nclass of non-polynomial SHSs which can be recast to polynomial SHSs via\naugmentation of additional states. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of\nresults via examples of SHSs drawn from different disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 16:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

Adequate data is usually a prerequisite,\nespecially when deep learning is adopted. However, the development levels of\ndifferent cities are unbalanced, and still many cities suffer from data\nscarcity. To address the problem, we propose a novel cross-city transfer\nlearning method for deep spatio-temporal prediction tasks, called RegionTrans.\nRegionTrans aims to effectively transfer knowledge from a data-rich source city\nto a data-scarce target city. More specifically, we first learn an inter-city\nregion matching function to match each target city region to a similar source\ncity region. A neural network is designed to effectively extract region-level\nrepresentation for spatio-temporal prediction. Finally, an optimization\nalgorithm is proposed to transfer learned features from the source city to the\ntarget city with the region matching function. Using citywide crowd flow\nprediction as a demonstration experiment, we verify the effectiveness of\nRegionTrans. Results show that RegionTrans can outperform the state-of-the-art\nfine-tuning deep spatio-temporal prediction models by reducing up to 10.7%\nprediction error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 16:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 04:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Most of the\nnonlinear materials used to build photonic platforms exhibit nonlinear losses\nsuch as multi-photon absorption, free-carrier absorption (FCA), and\nfree-carrier dispersion (FCD) which can strongly affect the nonlinear\ncharacteristics of the devices made out of these materials. In this work, we\nmodel the Kerr FC based on modified Lugiato-Lefever Equation (LLE) along with\nthe rate equation and develop analytical formulations to make quick estimations\nof the steady-state, modulation instability (MI) gain, bandwidth and the\ndynamics of Kerr Frequency-Comb (FC) in presence of nonlinear losses. Our\nanalytical model is valid over a broad wavelength range of interest as it\nincludes the effects of all nonlinear losses. Higher order (>3) characteristic\npolynomial of intra-cavity power describing the steady-state homogeneous\nsolution of the modified LLE are discussed in detail. We derive the generalized\nanalytical expressions for the threshold of normalized pump detuning to\ninitiate the optical bistability which is a necessary condition for the FC\ngeneration. Free-carrier dispersion-led nonlinear cavity detuning is observed\nthrough the reverse Kerr-tilt of the resonant-peaks. We further deduce the\nexpressions for the threshold pump intensity and the range of possible cavity\ndetuning for the initiation of the MI when all the nonlinear losses are\npresent. To corroborate our analytical findings, LLE along with the rate\nequations are solved numerically through split-step Fourier method. Our\ntheoretical study can explain several experimental results which are previously\nreported and thereby is able to provide a better understanding of the comb\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 17:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

It also follows that, unlike in Einstein's gravity,\nthe Riemann tensor is not traceless and it does not coincide with the Weyl\ntensor. Secondly, these curvatures are regularized at short distances such that\nthey are singularity-free, in particular the same happens for the Kretschmann\ninvariant. Unlike the others, the Weyl tensor vanishes at short distances,\nimplying that the spacetime metric becomes conformally flat in the region of\nnon-locality, in the ultraviolet. As a consequence, the non-local region can be\napproximated by a conformally flat manifold with non-negative constant\ncurvatures.

Here we aim to study the impact of eccentric and\ninclined massive giant planets on the terrestrial planet formation process, and\ninvestigate whether it can possibly lead to the existence of inclined\nterrestrial planets. We have performed 126 simulations of the late-stage\nplanetary accretion in eccentric and inclined giant planet systems. The\nphysical and orbital parameters of the giant planet systems result from n-body\nsimulations of three giant planets in the late stage of the gas disc, under the\ncombined action of Type II migration and planet-planet scattering. Fourteen\ntwo- and three-planet configurations have been selected, with diversified\nmasses, semi-major axes (resonant configurations or not), eccentricities and\ninclinations (including coplanar systems) at the dispersal of the gas disc. We\nhave then followed the gravitational interactions of these systems with an\ninner disc of planetesimals and embryos (9 runs per system), studying in detail\nthe final configurations of the formed terrestrial planets. While coplanar\ngiant systems harbour several terrestrial planets, generally as massive as the\nEarth and mainly on low eccentric and low inclined orbits, terrestrial planets\nformed in systems with mutually inclined giant planets are usually fewer, less\nmassive (<0.5 M_{\\Earth}) and with larger eccentricities and inclinations. This\nwork shows that terrestrial planets can form on stable inclined orbits through\nthe classical accretion theory, even in coplanar giant planet systems emerging\nfrom the disc phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 17:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Since hot\nsubdwarfs can form via a number of different evolution channels, a key question\nconcerns how the formation mechanism is connected to the present surface\nchemistry.

The radial distributions of material in the simulated satellite planes\nare similar to what we observe. Around the MW, our best-fitting model yields a\nsignificant fraction (0.22) of counter-rotating material, perhaps explaining\nwhy Sculptor counter-rotates within the MW satellite plane. In contrast, our\nmodel yields no counter-rotating material around M31. This is testable with\nproper motions of M31 satellites.\n  In our best model, the MW disk is thickened by the flyby 7.65 Gyr ago to a\nroot mean square height of 0.75 kpc. This is similar to the observed age and\nthickness of the Galactic thick disk. Thus, the MW thick disk may have formed\ntogether with the MW and M31 satellite planes during a past MW-M31 flyby.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 16:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 20:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 14:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 22:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

We measure electron densities with a\nrange of log(Ne)=3.92-4.36 cm^-3, and point out that such high densities may be\ncommon when measured using the CIII] doublet due to its large critical density.\nOverall, our observations demonstrate that while it is possible to trace\nvariations in large scale gas kinematics, detecting inhomogeneities in physical\ngas properties and their effects on the outflowing gas may be more difficult.\nThis study provides important lessons for the spatially-resolved rest-frame UV\nstudies expected with future observatories, such as JWST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 19:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a\ncritical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity\ndistribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\\mathrm{in}$. For small\ninner radii, $r_\\mathrm{in} \\lesssim (0.2 - 0.4) R_\\odot$, the modes are\nGR-driven, with periods of $\\approx 1 - 10$ yr.

We address a conceptual problem with previous measurements of the\nscale height and dispersion. When using this method, the dispersion and scale\nheight must refer to the same population of stars. The scale height is obtained\nfrom near-IR studies of edge-on galaxies and is weighted towards older\nkinematically hotter stars, whereas the dispersion obtained from integrated\nlight in the optical bands includes stars of all ages. We aim to extract the\ndispersion for the hotter stars, so that it can then be used with the correct\nscale height to obtain the disc surface mass density.

We show that\nsolubilization kinetics due to surfactants can determine the regimes of pore\ndynamics: either the pores open and reseal within a second (short-lived pore),\nor the pore stays open up to a few minutes (long-lived pore). First, we\nvalidate our model with previously published experimental measurements of pore\ndynamics. Then, we investigate how the solubilization kinetics and membrane\nproperties affect the dynamics of the pore and construct a phase diagram for\nshort and long-lived pores. Finally, we examine the dynamics of sequential pore\nopenings and show that cyclic short-lived pores occur at a period inversely\nproportional to the solubilization rate. By deriving a theoretical expression\nfor the cycle period, we provide an analytic tool to measure the solubilization\nrate of lipid vesicles by surfactants. Our findings shed light on some\nfundamental biophysical mechanisms that allow simple cell-like structures to\nsustain their integrity against environmental stresses, and have the potential\nto aid the design of vesicle-based drug delivery systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 19:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Drag reduction is achieved for the\ncase of materials with permeability in the vertical direction lower than the\none in the wall-parallel planes. This configuration limits the wall normal\nvelocity at the interface while promoting an increase of the tangential slip\nvelocity leading to an almost \"one-component\" turbulence where the low- and\nhigh-speed streaks coherence is strongly enhanced. On the other hand, strong\ndrag increase is found when a high wall-normal and low wall-parallel\npermeabilities are prescribed.

This has generated substantial interest over the last\ndecade, already too vast to be summarized here, in scalable methodologies for\nanalyzing large spatial datasets. Scalable spatial process models have been\nfound especially attractive due to their richness and flexibility and,\nparticularly so in the Bayesian paradigm, due to their presence in hierarchical\nmodel settings.

This article is submitted to the Practice section of the\njournal with the aim of developing massively scalable Bayesian approaches that\ncan rapidly deliver Bayesian inference on spatial process that are practically\nindistinguishable from inference obtained using more expensive alternatives.

Key insights are offered regarding assumptions\nand approximations concerning practical efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2018 21:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 18:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

However, a major\nconsequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for\nthe patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug\ninteractions, in which activity of one drug may change if taken with another\ndrug. The knowledge of drug interactions is limited because these complex\nrelationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small\nclinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an\nimportant challenge with significant implications for patient mortality. Here,\nwe present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The\napproach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions,\ndrug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are\nrepresented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a\ndifferent type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal\ngraphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph\nconvolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal\nnetworks. Decagon predicts the exact side effect, if any, through which a given\ndrug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy\nside effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it\nautomatically learns representations of side effects indicative of\nco-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models\nparticularly well side effects with a strong molecular basis, while on\npredominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because\nof effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon creates\nopportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient data to flag and\nprioritize side effects for follow-up analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 02:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 21:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

One of the knobs, the twist angle\nbetween different layers, plays a crucial role in the ultimate electronic\nproperties of a vdW heterostructure and does not have a direct analog in other\nsystems such as MBE-grown semiconductor heterostructures.

In order to get an advantage in his race of arms with the attacker, the\nanalyst designs the detector by relying on a subset of features chosen at\nrandom in V. Given its ignorance about the exact feature set, the adversary\nattacks a version of the detector based on the entire feature set. In this way,\nthe effectiveness of the attack diminishes since there is no guarantee that\nattacking a detector working in the full feature space will result in a\nsuccessful attack against the reduced-feature detector. We theoretically prove\nthat, thanks to random feature selection, the security of the detector\nincreases significantly at the expense of a negligible loss of performance in\nthe absence of attacks. We also provide an experimental validation of the\nproposed procedure by focusing on the detection of two specific kinds of image\nmanipulations, namely adaptive histogram equalization and median filtering.

We design a novel N-Family approach (N=1, 2, 3,\n...) based on the maximum influence arborescence (MIA) propagation model with\napproximation guarantee of (1-1/e). We then develop heuristic algorithms by\nextending the N-Family approach to other information propagation models (e.g.,\nindependent cascade, linear threshold) and influence maximization algorithms\n(e.g., CELF, reverse reachable sketch).

Most\nresearch on polar codes has focused on codes constructed from a $2\\times2$\npolarization matrix, called binary kernel: codes constructed from binary\nkernels have code lengths that are bound to powers of $2$. A few recent works\nhave proposed construction methods based on multiple kernels of different\ndimensions, not only binary ones, allowing code lengths different from powers\nof $2$. In this work, we design and implement the first multi-kernel successive\ncancellation polar code decoder in literature. It can decode any code\nconstructed with binary and ternary kernels: the architecture, sized for a\nmaximum code length $N_{max}$, is fully flexible in terms of code length, code\nrate and kernel sequence. The decoder can achieve frequency of more than $1$\nGHz in $65$ nm CMOS technology, and a throughput of $615$ Mb/s.

Each component receives secure compilation guarantees---in\nparticular, its internal invariants are protected from compromised\ncomponents---up to the point when this component itself becomes compromised,\nafter which we assume an attacker can take complete control and use this\ncomponent's privileges to attack other components. More precisely, a secure\ncompilation chain must ensure that a dynamically compromised component cannot\nbreak the safety properties of the system at the target level any more than an\narbitrary attacker-controlled component (with the same interface and\nprivileges, but without undefined behaviors) already could at the source level.\n  To illustrate the model, we construct a secure compilation chain for a small\nunsafe language with buffers, procedures, and components, targeting a simple\nabstract machine with built-in compartmentalization.

Recently,\nseveral unusual optomechanical effects have been unveiled when subtle\nspin-orbit interactions come at play to build up optical forces and torques\nthat are hardly seen in everyday life, such as negative optical radiation\npressure, transverse optical forces, or left-handed optical torques. To date,\nthere are only a few experimental proposals to reveal these effects despite\ntremendous conceptual advances. In particular, spin-dependent lateral forces\nand their angular analog are done either at the expense of direct observations\nor at the cost of specific instrumental complexity. Here we report on naked-eye\nidentification of light-induced spin-dependent lateral displacements of\ncentimeter-sized objects endowed with structured birefringence. Its angular\ncounterpart is also discussed and the observation of left-handed macroscopic\nrotational motion is reported.

The definition of CPS\nmost pertinent to this paper is: A CPS is a system with a coupling of the cyber\naspects of computing and communications with the physical aspects of dynamics\nand engineering that must abide by the laws of physics. This includes sensor\nnetworks, real-time and hybrid systems. To ensure that the computation results\nconform to the laws of physics a linear differential operator (LDO) is embedded\nin the processing channel for each sensor. In this manner the dynamics of the\nsystem can be incorporated prior to performing symbolic analysis. A non-linear\nquantization is used for the intervals corresponding to the symbols. The\nintervals are based on observed modes of the system, which can be determined\neither during an exploratory phase or online during operation of the system. A\ncomplete processing channel is called a single channel lexical analyser; one is\nmade available for each sensor on the machine being observed. The\nimplementation of LDO in the system is particularly important since it enables\nthe establishment of a causal link between the observations of the dynamic\nsystem and their cause. Without causality there can be no semantics and without\nsemantics no knowledge acquisition based on the physical background of the\nsystem being observed. Correlation alone is not a guarantee for causality. This\nwork was originally motivated from the observation of large bulk mate- rial\nhandling systems. Typically, there are $n = 150\\dots250$ sensors per machine,\nand data is collected in a multi rate manner; whereby general sensors are\nsampled with $f_s = 1Hz$ and vibration data being sampled in the kilo-hertz\nrange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 09:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-05"}

Current efforts aim to explore the\ncoherent dynamics of emitters coupled to several electromagnetic modes (EM).\nfreedom. Recently, ultrastrong coupling to a transmission line has been\nachieved where the emitter resonance broadens to a significant fraction of its\nfrequency. In this work we gain significantly improved control over this\nregime. We do so by combining the simplicity of a transmon qubit and a bespoke\nEM environment with a high density of discrete modes, hosted inside a\nsuperconducting metamaterial. This produces a unique device in which the\nhybridisation between the qubit and up to 10 environmental modes can be\nmonitored directly. Moreover the frequency and broadening of the qubit\nresonance can be tuned independently of each other in situ. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that our device combines this tunability with ultrastrong coupling\nand a qubit nonlinearity comparable to the other relevant energy scales in the\nsystem. We also develop a quantitative theoretical description that does not\ncontain any phenomenological parameters and that accurately takes into account\nvacuum fluctuations of our large scale quantum circuit in the regime of\nultrastrong coupling and intermediate non-linearity. The demonstration of this\nnew platform combined with a quantitative modelling brings closer the prospect\nof experimentally studying many-body effects in quantum optics. A limitation of\nthe current device is the intermediate nonlinearity of the qubit. Pushing it\nfurther will induce fully developed many-body effects, such as a giant Lamb\nshift or nonclassical states of multimode optical fields. Observing such\neffects would establish interesting links between quantum optics and the\nphysics of quantum impurities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 10:54:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 14:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 09:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

In this work, a new evolving and\nself-organizing controller namely Generic-controller, G-controller, is\nproposed. The G-controller that works in the fully online mode with very minor\nexpert domain knowledge is developed by incorporating the sliding model\ncontrol, SMC, theory based learning algorithm with an advanced incremental\nlearning machine namely Generic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System ,\nGENEFIS. The controller starts operating from scratch with an empty set of\nfuzzy rules, and therefore, no offline training is required. To cope with the\nplant vulnerable behavior, the controller can add, or prune the rules on\ndemand. Control law and adaptation laws for the consequents are derived from\nthe SMC algorithm to establish a stable closed-loop system, where the stability\nof the G-controller is guaranteed using the Lyapunov function. The uniform\nasymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero is witnessed through the\nimplication of an auxiliary robustifying control term. In addition, the\nimplementation of the multivariate Gaussian function helps the controller to\nhandle the non-axis parallel data from the plant and consequently enhances the\nrobustness against the uncertainties and environmental perturbations. Finally,\nthe controller performance has been evaluated by observing the tracking\nperformance in controlling simulated plants of unmanned aerial vehicle namely\nbio-inspired flapping wing micro air vehicle BIFW MAV and hexacopter for a\nvariety of trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 11:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-05"}

In particular, the so-called DM indirect\nsearches - mostly focused on a class of theoretically well-motivated DM\ncandidates such as the weakly-interacting massive particles - are affected by a\ncomplex astrophysical background of cosmic radiation. The understanding and\nmodeling of such background requires a deep comprehension of an intricate\nclassical plasma physics problem, i.e. the interaction between high-energy\ncharged particles, accelerated in peculiar astrophysical environments, and\nmagneto-hydrodynamic turbulence in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. In\nthis review we highlight several aspects of this exciting interplay between the\nmost recent claims of DM annihilation/decay signatures from the sky and the\nGalactic cosmic-ray research field. Our purpose is to further stimulate the\ndebate about viable astrophysical explanations, discussing possible directions\nthat would help breaking degeneracy patterns in the interpretation of current\ndata.

We use archival\nXMM-Newton and Chandra observations to study the origin of these peculiar X-ray\neclipsing phenomena. We find that the shape of the observed X-ray eclipse light\ncurves depends on both photon energy and the shape of the source extraction\nregion, and also shows differences between the two instruments. By performing\ndetailed simulations for the time-dependent X-ray dust scattering halo, as well\nas directly modelling the observed eclipse and non-eclipse halo profiles of AX\nJ1745.6-2901, we obtained solid evidence that its peculiar eclipse phenomena\nare indeed caused by the X-ray dust scattering in multiple foreground dust\nlayers along the line-of-sight (LOS).

At\nnon-secular time scales (from seconds to years) the effect of dynamical\nprocesses such as convection, rotation, and magnetic fields can modify the\nstellar oscillations. Convection excites acoustic modes in solar-like stars,\nwhile rotation and magnetic fields can perturb the oscillation frequencies\nlifting the degeneracy in the azimuthal component m of the eigenfrequencies.\nMoreover, the interaction between rotation, convection, and magnetic fields can\nproduce magnetic dynamos, which sometimes yield to regular magnetic activity\ncycles. In this chapter we review how stellar dynamics can be studied and\nexplain what long-term seismic observations can bring to the understanding of\nthis field. Thus, we show how we can study some properties of the convective\ntime scales operating in a star like the Sun. We also compare the stratified\ninformation we can obtain on the internal (radial) differential rotation from\nmain sequence solar-like stars, to the Sun, and to more evolved sub giants, and\ngiants. We complement this information on the internal rotation with the\ndetermination of the surface (latitudinal differential) rotation obtained\ndirectly from the light curves. Indeed, when stars are active there can be\nspots on their surfaces dimming the light emitted. When the star rotates, the\nemitted light will be modulated by the presence of these spots with a period\ncorresponding to the rotation rate at the active latitudes (where the spots\ndevelop). We conclude this chapter by discussing the seismology of fast\nrotating stars and, from a theoretical point of view, what are the current\nchallenges to infer properties of the internal structure and dynamics of\nintermediate- and high-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 12:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 14:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Further, the results from the Haines jump case are\nconsistent with experimental observations. A performance analysis reveals that\nthe semi-implicit method is able to perform stable simulations with much less\ncomputational effort than the explicit methods at low capillary numbers. The\nrelative benefit of using the semi-implicit method increases with decreasing\ncapillary number $\\mathrm{Ca}$, and at $\\mathrm{Ca} \\sim 10^{-8}$ the\ncomputational time needed is reduced by three orders of magnitude. This\nincreased efficiency enables simulations in the low-capillary number regime\nthat are unfeasible with explicit methods and the range of capillary numbers\nfor which the pore network model is a tractable modeling alternative is thus\ngreatly extended by the semi-implicit method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 14:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 10:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 09:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

Tail latencies are crucial in distributed\napplications with high fan-out ratios, because overall response time is\ndetermined by the slowest response. Size-aware sharding distributes requests\nfor keys to cores according to the size of the item associated with the key. In\nparticular, requests for small and large items are sent to disjoint subsets of\ncores. Size-aware sharding improves tail latencies by avoiding head-of-line\nblocking, in which a request for a small item gets queued behind a request for\na large item. Alternative size-unaware approaches to sharding, such as\nkeyhash-based sharding, request dispatching and stealing do not avoid\nhead-of-line blocking, and therefore exhibit worse tail latencies. The\nchallenge in implementing size-aware sharding is to maintain high throughput by\navoiding the cost of software dispatching and by achieving load balancing\nbetween different cores. Minos uses hardware dispatch for all requests for\nsmall items, which form the very large majority of all requests. It achieves\nload balancing by adapting the number of cores handling requests for small and\nlarge items to their relative presence in the workload. We compare Minos to\nthree state-of-the-art designs of in-memory KV stores. Compared to its closest\ncompetitor, Minos achieves a 99th percentile latency that is up to two orders\nof magnitude lower. Put differently, for a given value for the 99th percentile\nlatency equal to 10 times the mean service time, Minos achieves a throughput\nthat is up to 7.4 times higher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 14:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-05"}

This often leads to composite and complex controllers, with\ndifferent modes for hover, transition and forward flight.

A source was\ndetected in this cluster and its X-ray spectrum can be fitted with the\ncombination of a soft, neutron-star atmosphere model and a hard, power-law\nmodel. Both contributed roughly equally to the observed 0.5-10 keV luminosity\n(~4.8X10^33 erg/s). This type of X-ray spectrum is typically observed for\nquiescent neutron-star X-ray transients that are perhaps accreting in\nquiescence at very low rates. Therefore, if this X-ray source is the quiescent\ncounterpart of GRS 1747-312, then this source is also accreting at low levels\nin-between outbursts. Since source confusion a likely problem in globular\nclusters, it is quite possible that part, if not all, of the emission we\nobserved is not related to GRS 1747-312, and is instead associated with another\nsource or conglomeration of sources in the cluster.

The central remnant could launch a\ncollimated jet and when the jet propagating through the ejecta, a mildly\nrelativistic cocoon would be formed and the interaction between the cocoon and\nthe ambient medium would accelerate electrons via external shock in a wide\nangle.

Secondly, low-resolution image\nrepresentation is adopted for high efficiency compression in terms of most of\nbit spent by image's structures under low bit-rate. However, more bits should\nbe assigned to image details in the high-resolution, when most of structures\nhave been kept after compression at the high bit-rate.

However, most of\nthe health care data are in unstructured form and it consumes a lot of time and\neffort to pull them into relational form. This study proposes a novel data lake\narchitecture to reduce the data ingestion time and improve the precision of\nhealthcare analytics. It also removes the data silos and enhances the analytics\nby allowing the connectivity to the third-party data providers (such as\nclinical lab results, chemist, insurance company,etc.). The data lake\narchitecture uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to provide the\nstorage for both structured and unstructured data. This study uses K-means\nclustering algorithm to find the patient clusters with similar health\nconditions. Subsequently, it employs a support vector machine to find the most\nsuccessful healthcare recommendations for the each cluster. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate the ability of data lake to reduce the time for ingesting\ndata from various data vendors regardless of its format. Moreover, it is\nevident that the data lake poses the potential to generate clusters of patients\nmore precisely than the existing approaches. It is obvious that the data lake\nprovides a unified storage location for the data in its native format. It can\nalso improve the personalized healthcare medication recommendations by removing\nthe data silos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 04:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

We focus on the problem where the service rates $\\mu$ are\nunknown with the holding-cost regret (regret against the $c \\mu$ rule with\nknown $\\mu$) as our objective. We show that the greedy algorithm that uses\nempirically learned service rates results in a constant holding-cost regret\n(the regret is independent of the time horizon). This free exploration can be\nexplained in the single server setting by the fact that any work-conserving\npolicy obtains the same number of samples in a busy cycle.\n  In the parallel server setting, we show that the $c \\mu$ rule may result in\nunstable queues, even for arrival rates within the capacity region. We then\npresent sufficient conditions for geometric ergodicity under the $c \\mu$ rule.\nUsing these results, we propose an almost greedy algorithm that explores only\nwhen the number of samples falls below a threshold. We show that this algorithm\ndelivers constant holding-cost regret because a free exploration condition is\neventually satisfied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 05:57:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 13:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}
