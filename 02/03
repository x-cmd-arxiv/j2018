In particular, graph games with\n$\\omega$-regular winning conditions, specified as parity objectives, which can\nexpress properties such as safety, liveness, fairness, are the basic framework\nfor verification and synthesis of reactive systems. The decisions for a player\nat various states of the graph game are represented as strategies. While the\nalgorithmic problem for solving graph games with parity objectives has been\nwidely studied, the most prominent data-structure for strategy representation\nin graph games has been binary decision diagrams (BDDs). However, due to the\nbit-level representation, BDDs do not retain the inherent flavor of the\ndecisions of strategies, and are notoriously hard to minimize to obtain\nsuccinct representation. In this work we propose decision trees for strategy\nrepresentation in graph games. Decision trees retain the flavor of decisions of\nstrategies and allow entropy-based minimization to obtain succinct trees.\nHowever, decision trees work in settings (e.g., probabilistic models) where\nerrors are allowed, and overfitting of data is typically avoided. In contrast,\nfor strategies in graph games no error is allowed, and the decision tree must\nrepresent the entire strategy. We develop new techniques to extend decision\ntrees to overcome the above obstacles, while retaining the entropy-based\ntechniques to obtain succinct trees. We have implemented our techniques to\nextend the existing decision tree solvers. We present experimental results for\nproblems in reactive synthesis to show that decision trees provide a much more\nefficient data-structure for strategy representation as compared to BDDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 16:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

In the early stages, we show that nucleation\nrequires a structural reorganization of the liquid phase, called stress-driven\nageing. Once nucleation starts, we observe that crystallization follows three\ndifferent routes: direct crystallization of the liquid phase, Bergeron process,\nand Ostwald ripening. Nucleation starts inside the reorganised network, but\ncrystals grow past it by direct condensation of the gas phase on their surface,\ndriving liquid evaporation, and producing a network structure different from\nthe original phase separation pattern. We argue that similar crystal-gel states\ncan be formed in monoatomic and molecular systems if the liquid phase is slow\nenough to induce viscoelastic phase separation, but fast enough to prevent\nimmediate vitrification.

These\nmethods are based on a physical understanding of the underlying behavior of the\nflow in the vicinity of the feature. Particularly, they rely on definition of\nsuitable criteria (i.e. point-based or neighborhood-based derived properties)\nand proper selection of thresholds. For instance, among other techniques,\nvortex identification can be done through computing the Q-criterion or by\nconsidering the center of looping streamlines. However, these methods rely on\ncreative visualization of physical idiosyncrasies of specific features and flow\nregimes, making them non-universal and requiring significant effort to develop.\nHere we present a physics-based, data-driven method capable of identifying any\nflow feature it is trained to. We use convolutional neural networks, a machine\nlearning approach developed for image recognition, and adapt it to the problem\nof identifying flow features. The method was tested using mean flow fields from\nnumerical simulations, where the recirculation region and boundary layer were\nidentified in a two-dimensional flow through a convergent-divergent channel,\nand the horseshoe vortex was identified in three-dimensional flow over a\nwing-body junction. The novelty of the method is its ability to identify any\ntype of feature, even distinguish between similar ones, without the need to\nexplicitly define the physics (i.e. through development of suitable criterion\nand tunning of threshold). This provides a general method and removes the large\nburden placed on identifying new features.

The Pbnm phase benefits from the simultaneous\noccurrence of antiphase and in-phase tilt patterns that compete with each\nother, but not as strongly as to be mutually exclusive. We also find that\nsecondary antipolar modes, involving the A cations, contribute to weaken the\ncompetition between different tilts and play a key role in their coexistence.\nOur results thus confirm and better explain previous observations for\nparticular compounds. Interestingly, we also find that strain effects, which\nare known to be a major factor governing phase competition in related (e.g.,\nferroelectric) perovskite oxides, play no essential role as regards the\nrelative stability of different rotational polymorphs. Further, we discuss why\nthe Pbnm structure stops being the ground state in two opposite limits, for\nlarge and small A cations, showing that very different effects become relevant\nin each case.

Scrambling can be measured using out-of-time-ordered correlators\n(OTOCs), which are closely tied to the growth of Heisenberg operators. In this\nwork, we present a general method to calculate OTOCs of local operators in\nlocal one-dimensional systems based on approximating Heisenberg operators as\nmatrix-product operators (MPOs). Contrary to the common belief that such tensor\nnetwork methods work only at early times, we show that the entire early growth\nregion of the OTOC can be captured using an MPO approximation with modest bond\ndimension. We analytically establish the goodness of the approximation by\nshowing that if an appropriate OTOC is close to its initial value, then the\nassociated Heisenberg operator has low entanglement across a given cut. We use\nthe method to study scrambling in a chaotic spin chain with $201$ sites. Based\non this data and OTOC results for black holes, local random circuit models, and\nnon-interacting systems, we conjecture a universal form for the dynamics of the\nOTOC near the wavefront. We show that this form collapses the chaotic spin\nchain data over more than fifteen orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 18:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

While the accreted stellar halo\nis dominated by the contributions of massive satellites, we show that\nsatellites with low virial mass (i.e. low satellite-to-host virial mass ratio,\nVMRs) are important contributors to the population of accreted GCs. The\nrelative contribution of accretion events with low VMRs is highest for the halo\npopulation of blue GCs and gradually decreases for red GCs and accreted stars.\nAs a consequence of the reduced efficiency of dynamical friction on minor\nmergers, our populations of cosmologically accreted blue GCs are systematically\nmore spatially extended and have higher velocity dispersions than for red GCs,\nin agreement with observations.

Frequent usage\nof Gaussian random variables in this process requires a properly optimized\nGaussian Random Number Generator (GRNG). The high hardware cost of conventional\nGRNG makes the hardware implementation of BNNs challenging.\n  In this paper, we propose VIBNN, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator design\nfor variational inference on BNNs.

The main reason for catastrophic\nforgetting is that the past data are not available during learning. Typical\napproaches keep some exemplars for the past classes and use distillation\nregularization to retain the classification capability on the past classes and\nbalance the past and new classes. However, there are four main problems with\nthese approaches. First, the loss function is not efficient for classification.\nSecond, there is unbalance problem between the past and new classes. Third, the\nsize of pre-decided exemplars is usually limited and they might not be\ndistinguishable from unseen new classes. Forth, the exemplars may not be\nallowed to be kept for a long time due to privacy regulations. To address these\nproblems, we propose (a) a new loss function to combine the cross-entropy loss\nand distillation loss, (b) a simple way to estimate and remove the unbalance\nbetween the old and new classes , and (c) using Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) to generate historical data and select representative exemplars during\ngeneration.

However, the former needs\nto train a set of isolate binary networks which ignore dependencies between\nlabels and have heavy computational load, while the latter needs an additional\nthreshold function mechanism to transform the multi-class probabilities to\nmulti-label outputs. In this paper, we propose a joint binary neural network\n(JBNN), to address these shortcomings. In JBNN, the representation of the text\nis fed to a set of logistic functions instead of a softmax function, and the\nmultiple binary classifications are carried out synchronously in one neural\nnetwork framework.

In this paper, we propose an approach, called\nleft-center-right separated neural network with rotatory attention (LCR-Rot),\nto better address the two problems. Our approach has two characteristics: 1) it\nhas three separated LSTMs, i.e., left, center and right LSTMs, corresponding to\nthree parts of a review (left context, target phrase and right context); 2) it\nhas a rotatory attention mechanism which models the relation between target and\nleft/right contexts. The target2context attention is used to capture the most\nindicative sentiment words in left/right contexts. Subsequently, the\ncontext2target attention is used to capture the most important word in the\ntarget. This leads to a two-side representation of the target: left-aware\ntarget and right-aware target. We compare our approach on three benchmark\ndatasets with ten related methods proposed recently.

Due to the high computational complexity and memory storage requirement,\nit is hard to directly deploy a full-precision CNN on embedded devices. The\nhardware-friendly designs are needed for re-source-limited and\nenergy-constrained embed-ded devices. Emerging solutions are adopted for the\nneural network compression, e.g., bina-ry/ternary weight network, pruned\nnetwork and quantized network. Among them, Binarized Neural Network (BNN) is\nbelieved to be the most hardware-friendly framework due to its small network\nsize and low computational com-plexity. No existing work has further shrunk the\nsize of BNN. In this work, we explore the redun-dancy in BNN and build a\ncompact BNN (CBNN) based on the bit-level sensitivity analy-sis and bit-level\ndata pruning. The input data is converted to a high dimensional bit-sliced\nfor-mat. In post-training stage, we analyze the im-pact of different bit slices\nto the accuracy. By pruning the redundant input bit slices and shrinking the\nnetwork size, we are able to build a more compact BNN. Our result shows that we\ncan further scale down the network size of the BNN up to 3.9x with no more than\n1% accuracy drop.

Contrary to previous works in multimodal sentiment\nanalysis which focus on holistic information in speech segments such as bag of\nwords representations and average facial expression intensity, we develop a\nnovel deep architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis that performs\nmodality fusion at the word level. In this paper, we propose the Gated\nMultimodal Embedding LSTM with Temporal Attention (GME-LSTM(A)) model that is\ncomposed of 2 modules. The Gated Multimodal Embedding alleviates the\ndifficulties of fusion when there are noisy modalities. The LSTM with Temporal\nAttention performs word level fusion at a finer fusion resolution between input\nmodalities and attends to the most important time steps. As a result, the\nGME-LSTM(A) is able to better model the multimodal structure of speech through\ntime and perform better sentiment comprehension.

This has been fuelled by\nthe discovery of several physical phenomena that exhibit unusual higher rank\nmultipole moments, beyond that of the conventional degrees of freedom as charge\nand magnetic dipole moment. Moreover, the higher rank electric/magnetic\nmultipole moments have been suggested as promising order parameters in exotic\nhidden order phases.

Under a generative hypergraph\nmodel called \"d-wise hypergraph stochastic block model\" (d-hSBM) which\nnaturally extends the Stochastic Block Model from graphs to d-uniform\nhypergraphs, the asymptotic minimax mismatch ratio is characterized. For\nproving the achievability, we propose a two-step polynomial time algorithm that\nachieves the fundamental limit. The first step of the algorithm is a hypergraph\nspectral clustering method which achieves partial recovery to a certain\nprecision level. The second step is a local refinement method which leverages\nthe underlying probabilistic model along with parameter estimation from the\noutcome of the first step. To characterize the asymptotic performance of the\nproposed algorithm, we first derive a sufficient condition for attaining weak\nconsistency in the hypergraph spectral clustering step. Then, under the\nguarantee of weak consistency in the first step, we upper bound the worst-case\nrisk attained in the local refinement step by an exponentially decaying\nfunction of the size of the hypergraph and characterize the decaying rate. For\nproving the converse, the lower bound of the minimax mismatch ratio is set by\nfinding a smaller parameter space which contains the most dominant error\nevents, inspired by the analysis in the achievability part. It turns out that\nthe minimax mismatch ratio decays exponentially fast to zero as the number of\nnodes tends to infinity, and the rate function is a weighted combination of\nseveral divergence terms, each of which is the Renyi divergence of order 1/2\nbetween two Bernoulli's. The Bernoulli's involved in the characterization of\nthe rate function are those governing the random instantiation of hyperedges in\nd-hSBM. Experimental results on synthetic data validate our theoretical finding\nthat the refinement step is critical in achieving the optimal statistical\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Feb 2018 06:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

Existing methods are inadequate in capturing the dynamic\nstructure of care. We propose Resset, an end-to-end recurrent model that reads\nmedical record and predicts future risk. The model adopts the algebraic view in\nthat discrete medical objects are embedded into continuous vectors lying in the\nsame space.

The interaction between the disease bag and the\ntreatment bag at a visit is modeled in several, one of which as residual of\ndiseases minus the treatments.

How does the binding energy depend\nupon the size or number of atoms in one of a pair of identical nanostructures?\nTo answer this question, we treat each nanostructure properly as a whole\nobject, not as a collection of atoms. Our calculations start from an accurate\nstatic dipole polarizability for each considered nanostructure, and an accurate\nequilibrium center-to-center distance for the pair (the latter from experiment,\nor from the vdW-DF-cx functional). We consider the competition in each term\n$-C_{2k}/d^{2k}$ ($k=3, 4, 5$) of the long-range vdW series for the interaction\nenergy, between the size dependence of the vdW coefficient $C_{2k}$ and that of\nthe $2k$-th power of the center-to-center distance $d$. The damping of these\nvdW terms can be negligible, but in any case it does not affect the size\ndependence for a given term in the absence of non-vdW binding. To our surprise,\nthe vdW energy can be size-independent for quasi-spherical nanoclusters bound\nto one another by vdW interaction, even with strong nonadditivity of the vdW\ncoefficient, as demonstrated for fullerenes. We also show that, for\nlow-dimensional systems, the vdW interaction yields the strongest\nsize-dependence, in stark contrast to that of fullerenes.

Information field dynamics\nattempts to improve on existing simulation schemes by incorporating Bayesian\nfield inference into the simulation scheme. The field inference is truly\nBayesian and thus depends on a notion of prior belief. A number of results are\npresented, both theoretical and practical. Many small fixes and results on the\ngeneral theory are presented, before exploring two general classes of\nsimulation schemes that are possible in the IFD framework. For both, we present\na set of theoretical results alongside the development of a prototype scheme.\nThe first class of models corresponds roughly to traditional fixed-grid\nnumerical PDE solvers. The prior Bayesian assumption in these models is that\nthe fields are smooth, and their correlation structure does not vary between\nlocations. For these reasons we call them translation-invariant schemes. We\nshow the requirements for stability of these schemes, but most importantly we\nprove that these schemes indeed converge to the true behaviour of the field in\nthe limit of high resolutions. Convergence had never been shown for any\nprevious IFD scheme. We also find the error scaling of these codes and show\nthat they implement something very analogous to a high-order finite-difference\nderivative approximation, which are the most elementary and well-studied\nnumerical schemes. This is an important result, which proves the validity of\nthe IFD approach.
