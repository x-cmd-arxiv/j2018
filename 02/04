We present results of far-UV\nobservations of WASP-18 obtained with COS on board of Hubble Space Telescope\naimed at explaining this anomaly. From the star's spectral energy distribution,\nwe infer the extinction (E(B-V) $\\approx$ 0.01 mag) and then the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) column density for a number of ions, concluding that ISM\nabsorption is not the origin of the anomaly. We measure the flux of the four\nstellar emission features detected in the COS spectrum (CII, CIII, CIV, SiIV).\nComparing the CII/CIV flux ratio measured for WASP-18 with that derived from\nspectra of nearby stars with known age, we see that the far-UV spectrum of\nWASP-18 resembles that of old ($>$5 Gyr), inactive stars, in stark contrast\nwith its young age. We conclude that WASP-18 has an intrinsically low activity\nlevel, possibly caused by star-planet tidal interaction, as suggested by\nprevious studies. Re-scaling the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match\nthe flux of the SiIV line, yields an XUV integrated flux at the planet orbit of\n10.2 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.

Network theory is apparently a promising approach to\ndescribe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during\nmusic listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined\nwithin the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Using naturalistic\nmusic, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with\ndifferent cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface EEG\nmeasurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to\nquantify the interplay among rhythms.

Indeed,\ndownlink (DL) training and uplink (UL) feedback overheads scale linearly with\nthe number of base station (BS) antennas, in sharp contrast to TDD-based\nmassive MIMO, where a single UL pilot trains the whole BS array. In this work,\nwe propose a graph-theoretic approach to reducing DL training and UL feedback\noverheads in FDD massive MIMO systems. In particular, we consider a single-cell\nscenario involving a single BS with a massive antenna array serving to\nsingle-antenna mobile stations (MSs) in the DL. We assume the BS employs\ntwo-stage beamforming in the DL, comprising DFT pre-beamforming followed by\nMU-MIMO precoding. The proposed graph-theoretic approach exploits knowledge of\nthe angular spectra of the BS-MS channels to construct DL training protocols\nwith reduced overheads. Simulation results reveal that the proposed\ntraining-resources allocation method can provide approximately 35% sum-rate\nperformance gain compared to conventional orthogonal training.

So far, integration of these two different modalities\nis a difficult process, involving many decisions concerning how best to\nrepresent the information so that it will be captured or useful, and\nhand-labeling large amounts of data. DeepType overcomes this challenge by\nexplicitly integrating symbolic information into the reasoning process of a\nneural network with a type system. First we construct a type system, and\nsecond, we use it to constrain the outputs of a neural network to respect the\nsymbolic structure. We achieve this by reformulating the design problem into a\nmixed integer problem: create a type system and subsequently train a neural\nnetwork with it. In this reformulation discrete variables select which\nparent-child relations from an ontology are types within the type system, while\ncontinuous variables control a classifier fit to the type system. The original\nproblem cannot be solved exactly, so we propose a 2-step algorithm: 1)\nheuristic search or stochastic optimization over discrete variables that define\na type system informed by an Oracle and a Learnability heuristic, 2) gradient\ndescent to fit classifier parameters.

The polarisation signatures of\nthe secondary appear to have a systematically larger amplitude than that of the\nprimary. This corresponds to a stronger magnetic field, for which the magnetic\nenergy of the secondary exceeds that of the primary by a factor of 3.3-5.7.\nWhile the magnetic energy is similar for the secondary star in the two epochs,\nthe magnetic energy is about twice as high in 2017 for the primary. The\nmagnetic field topology of the two stars in the earlier epoch (2014) is very\ndifferent. In the earlier epoch, the magnetic field at the visible pole appears\nto be of opposite polarity for the primary and secondary, suggesting linked\nmagnetospheres. The apparent rotational periods of both $\\sigma^2$ CrB\ncomponents are longer than the orbital period, which we interpret as an\nevidence of a solar-like differential rotation. Despite their nearly identical\nfundamental parameters, the components of $\\sigma^2$ CrB system exhibit\ndifferent magnetic field properties.

Previous studies have dealt with\nconvergence and stability analysis of such systems for a few specific initial\nnode opinions and network structures, and here we focus on how individual\nbiases affect social equilibria and their stabilities.

The color excess ratio, $E_{\\rm JH}/E_{\\rm JK_S}$, is 0.657\nfor the Monoceros SNR, consistent with the average value 0.652 for the Milky\nWay (Xue et al. 2016). The consistency is resulted from that the SNR material\nis dominated by interstellar dust rather than the supernova ejecta. $E_{\\rm\nJH}/E_{\\rm JK_S}$ equals to 0.658 for the Rosette Nebula, further proving the\nuniversality of the near-infrared extinction law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 03:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We here develop a Bayesian generalized additive modeling\nframework tailored to estimate complex trends in marginal extremes observed\nover space and time. Our approach is based on a set of regression equations\nlinked to the exceedance probability above a high threshold and to the size of\nthe excess, the latter being modeled using the generalized Pareto (GP)\ndistribution suggested by Extreme-Value Theory. Latent random effects are\nmodeled additively and semi-parametrically using Gaussian process priors, which\nprovides high flexibility and interpretability. Fast and accurate estimation of\nposterior distributions may be performed thanks to the Integrated Nested\nLaplace approximation (INLA), efficiently implemented in the R-INLA software,\nwhich we also use for determining a nonstationary threshold based on a model\nfor the body of the distribution.

Like other Trefftz methods, it employs a\nnon-standard discretisation basis consisting of solutions of the partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) at hand. We analyse the convergence and numerical\nstability of the Wave Based Method for Helmholtz problems using tools from\napproximation theory. We show that the set of discretisation functions more\nclosely resembles a frame, a redundant set of functions, than a basis. The\nredundancy of a frame typically leads to ill-conditioning, which indeed is\ncommon in Trefftz methods. Recent theoretical results on frames for function\napproximation suggest that the associated ill-conditioned system matrix can be\nsuccessfully regularised, with error bounds available, when using a discrete\nleast squares approach. While the original Wave Based Method is based on a\nweighted residual formulation, in this paper we pursue an oversampled\ncollocation approach instead.

The\nCa$_{\\rm{II}}$ H\\&K break value (0.29$\\pm$0.05) is compatible with the range\nexpected for the long-sought intermediate population between BL Lacs and FRI\nradio galaxies. An overall SED fitting from Radio to $\\gamma$-ray band shows\nproperties typical of a low-power BL Lac. As a whole, these results suggest\nthat this transient could well be a new example of the recently discovered\nclass of radio-weak BL Lac, showing for the first time a flare in the\ngamma/X-ray bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 10:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

The very\nlarge interaction strengths and the very long propagation distances of these\nfully-guided dipolaritons open up new opportunities for realizing complex\nquantum circuitry and quantum simulators, as well as topological states based\non exciton-polaritons, for which the interactions between polaritons need to be\nlarge and spatially or temporally controlled. The results also raise\nfundamental questions on the origin of such large enhancements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 13:36:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 20:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Inspired by the accumulated evidence regarding the\ncrucial role played by soft quasilocalized excitations in glassy dynamics, we\npropose that the bulk average of the glass response to a localized force dipole\ndefines such a characteristic energy scale.

The formation of the grain mantles has two important consequences:\nit removes species from the gas phase and promotes the synthesis of new\nmolecules on the grain surfaces. The composition of the mantle is a strong\nfunction of the environment which the cloud belongs to. Therefore, clouds in\nhigh-zeta galaxies, where conditions -like temperature, metallicity and cosmic\nrays flux- are different from those in the Milky Way, will have different grain\nmantles. In the last years, several authors have suggested that silicate grains\nmight grow by accretion of silicon bearing species on smaller seeds. This would\noccur simultaneously to the formation of the iced mantles and be greatly\naffected by its composition as a function of time. In this work, we present a\nnumerical study of the grain mantle formation in high-zeta galaxies and we\nquantitatively address the possibility of silicate growth. We find that the\nmantle thickness decreases with increasing redshift, from about 120 to 20\nlayers for z varying from 0 to 8. Furthermore, the mantle composition is also a\nstrong function of the cloud redshift, with the relative importance of CO, CO2,\nammonia, methane and methanol highly varying with z. Finally, being Si-bearing\nspecies always a very minor component of the mantle, the formation of silicates\nin molecular clouds is practically impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 15:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

The particle size,\ndislocation density, strain and optical band gap have a turning point close to\nthe doping concentration of 6%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 12:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

Accordingly, the Josephson\ncoupling energy is found to be equal to the rest mass energy of these photons.\nThe Josephson effect is described by propagation of massive photon field\nfollowing the universal quantum equation instead of being due to quantum\ntunnelling. The mass of the photon is found to be dependent on the electric\nproperties of the junction. A characteristic (critical) quantized capacitance\nof the junction is found to be inversely related to the critical current. The\nquantum (kinetic) inductance induced in the junction is found to be equal to\n$L_q=\\mu_0\\lambda_J$\\,, where $\\lambda_J$ is the Josephson penetration depth,\nand $\\mu_0$ is the free space permeability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 14:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

However, almost\nall of existing studies focus on the deterministic problem that assumes all\nparameters are known perfectly at the time when the planning and routing\ndecisions are made. In reality, some parameters are random and unknown.\nTherefore, in this paper, we consider VRPPC with hard time windows and random\ndemand, called Optimal Delivery Planning (ODP). The proposed ODP aims to\nminimize the total package delivery cost while meeting the customer time window\nconstraints. We use stochastic integer programming to formulate the\noptimization problem incorporating the customer demand uncertainty. Moreover,\nwe evaluate the performance of the ODP using test data from benchmark dataset\nand from actual Singapore road map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 08:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}
