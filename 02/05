This transition is shown to be accompanied with a metal-insulator\ntransition, as well as a singularity in the electronic compressibility. To this\nend, the electronic system which is assumed to be in contact with an electronic\nreservoir, is meshed by using of the phase coherence length $\\zeta_{\\phi}$ as\nan extent which divides the spatial dynamics of the electrons into two separate\nregimes and controls the localization of electrons. For the scales much smaller\nthan $\\zeta_{\\phi}$ the treatment is quantum mechanical, whereas for the scales\nmuch larger than $\\zeta_{\\phi}$ the picture of semi-classical transport works\nand the classical Mote Carlo method is used. Thomas-Fermi-Dirac (TFD) theory is\nemployed to find the dependence of the free energy of each cell on the\ntemperature ($T$), the (charged) disorder strength ($\\Delta$) and the charge\ncontent of the cell, and a cellular automaton model for transporting the\nelectrons between the cells is developed.

The local topological\ninformation drives the global geometrical navigation and the MST can be\ninterpreted as a growing path that greedily maximizes local similarity between\nthe nodes attached at each step by globally minimizing their overall distances\nin the network. This is also valid in absence of the network structure and in\npresence of only the nodes geometrically located over the network generative\nmanifold in a high-dimensional space. We know that random geometric graphs in\nthe hyperbolic space are an adequate model for realistic complex networks: the\nexplanation of this connection is that complex networks exhibit hierarchical,\ntree-like organization, and in turn the hyperbolic geometry is the geometry of\ntrees. Here we show that, according to a mechanism that we define similarity\nattachment, the visited node sequence of a network automaton can efficiently\napproximate the nodes' angular coordinates in the hyperbolic disk, that\nactually represent an ordering of their similarities.

It is becoming increasingly clear that many mobile animal\ngroups are composed of heterogeneous individuals with differential levels and\ntypes of influence over group behaviors. The ability to infer this differential\ninfluence, or leadership, is critical to understanding group functioning in\nthese collective animal systems. Due to the broad interpretation of leadership,\nmany different measures and mathematical tools are used to describe and infer\n\"leadership\", e.g., position, causality, influence, information flow. But a key\nquestion remains: which, if any, of these concepts actually describes\nleadership? We argue that instead of asserting a single definition or notion of\nleadership, the complex interaction rules and dynamics typical of a group\nimplies that leadership itself is not merely a binary classification (leader or\nfollower), but rather, a complex combination of many different components. In\nthis paper we develop an anatomy of leadership, identify several principle\ncomponents and provide a general mathematical framework for discussing\nleadership. With the intricacies of this taxonomy in mind we present a set of\nleadership-oriented toy models that should be used as a proving ground for\nleadership inference methods going forward.

In this paper we present an\n\\emph{on-the-fly} approach to classify each newly downloaded tweet as\n\\emph{autogenerated} or not. We define an autogenerated tweet (AGT) as a tweet\nwhere all or parts of the natural language content is generated automatically\nby a bot or other type of program.\n  Our on-the-fly approach makes use of two classifiers. The first classifies a\ntweet solely based on the twitter text and the tweet metadata that comes with\nevery tweet. It is used for tweets posted by unknown users with no available\ntweet history. An unknown user also triggers a batch job to start downloading\nthe missing user timeline information. The second classifier is used for tweets\nposted by a user where the user timeline is downloaded and available.\nInitially, it will be the first classifier that handles most of the tweets.\nThis will gradually change and after an initialization phase where we download\nhistoric data for the most active users, we reach a state where the second\nclassifier handles a vast majority of all the tweets.\n  A simulation using our on-the-fly detection mechanism indicates that we can\nhandle Twitter streams with up to 68,000 unique users each day.

In ordered regular lattices, where LRIs have a\nclear geometrical meaning, their presence allow for hoppings between more\ndistant sites, yet with a smaller probability. In such cases, it is found that\nLRIs do not affect the dependency of the mean square displacement (MSD)\ntraveled by the walker: exact analytical results for the the cycle graph within\nthe Markov chain framework shows that MSD follows the same linearly increasing\nbehavior with time when LRIs are absent, independently of the strength of LRI.\nThis contrasts with the superdiffusive scenario in complex networks. When they\nhave very short diameter ($\\sim \\log N$), the analysis of the time dependency\nof MSD becomes quite difficult, as it saturates very quickly even when LRIs are\nabsent. The presence of a faster than linearly increasing growth phase can be\nnoticed, but it can hardly be measured with precision. This effect is\nsidestepped on small-world Newman-Watts (NW) networks, where the network\ndiameter can be controlled by the number of new links (shortcuts) that are\nadded to the cycle graph. The time duration $t_f$ of the superdiffusive regime\nand the power law exponent can be adequately evaluated by numerical methods.\nThey depend on the number of nodes and shortcuts, as well as the strength of\nLRIs. Although the later causes a strong reduction in $t_f$ when shortcuts are\npresent, their presence by itself is not sufficient to trigger a superdiffusive\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 21:37:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 08:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

In this regard,\nmillions of fielded photovoltaic (PV) modules may serve as a global testbed,\nwhere we can interpret the routinely collected maximum power point (MPP)\ntime-series data to assess the time-dependent \"health\" thereof. The existing\ncharacterization methods, however, cannot effectively mine/decode these\ndatasets to identify various degradation pathways of the corresponding solar\nmodules. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, i.e., the Suns-Vmp\nmethod, which offers a simple and powerful approach to monitoring and\ndiagnosing time-dependent degradation of solar modules by physically mining the\nMPP data. The algorithm reconstructs \"IV\" curves by using the natural\nillumination- and temperature-dependent daily MPP characteristics as\nconstraints to fit the physics-based compact model. These synthetic IV\ncharacteristics are then used to determine the time-dependent evolution of\ncircuit parameters (e.g., series resistance) which in-turn allows one to deduce\nthe dominant degradation mode (e.g., corrosion) for the modules. The proposed\nmethod has been applied to analyze the MPP data from a test facility at the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Our analysis indicates that the\nsolar modules degraded at a rate of 0.7 %/year due to discoloration and\nweakened solder bonds.

The spectral approach is shown to converge to the true\nexterior calculus in the limit of large data. Simultaneously, the spectral\napproach decouples the memory requirements from the amount of data points and\nambient space dimension. To achieve this, the exterior calculus is reformulated\nentirely in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian\noperator on functions. The exterior derivatives of these eigenfunctions (and\ntheir wedge products) are shown to form a frame (a type of spanning set) for\nappropriate $L^2$ spaces of $k$-forms, as well as higher-order Sobolev spaces.\nFormulas are derived to express the Laplace-de Rham operators on forms in terms\nof the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions. By\nrepresenting the Laplace-de Rham operators in this frame, spectral convergence\nresults are obtained via Galerkin approximation techniques. Numerical examples\ndemonstrate accurate recovery of eigenvalues and eigenforms of the Laplace-de\nRham operator on 1-forms. The correct Betti numbers are obtained from the\nkernel of this operator approximated from data sampled on several orientable\nand non-orientable manifolds, and the eigenforms are visualized via their\ncorresponding vector fields. These vector fields form a natural orthonormal\nbasis for the space of square-integrable vector fields, and are ordered by a\nDirichlet energy functional which measures oscillatory behavior. The spectral\nframework also shows promising results on a non-smooth example (the Lorenz 63\nattractor), suggesting that a spectral formulation of exterior calculus may be\nfeasible in spaces with no differentiable structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2018 22:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 15:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 01:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 02:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

By replacing\nthe random number input stream in a simulation procedure by a low-discrepancy\nnumber input stream, variance reductions of several orders have been observed\nin financial applications.\n  Analysis of stochastic effects in well-mixed chemical reaction networks often\nrelies on sample path simulation using Monte Carlo methods, even though these\nmethods suffer from typical slow $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rates as a\nfunction of the number of sample paths $N$.

Yet,\nscan time limitations may prohibit acquisition of certain contrasts, and images\nfor some contrast may be corrupted by noise and artifacts. In such cases, the\nability to synthesize unacquired or corrupted contrasts from remaining\ncontrasts can improve diagnostic utility. For multi-contrast synthesis, current\nmethods learn a nonlinear intensity transformation between the source and\ntarget images, either via nonlinear regression or deterministic neural\nnetworks.

The spectrum of a single choice of H0,H1 or H alone\ndetermines the Betti numbers b0,b1 of G as well as the spectrum of the other\nmatrices. It follows that b0 is the number of eigenvalues 1 of L and that b1 is\nthe number of eigenvalues -1 of L.

However, language can represent only\na subset of our rich and detailed cognitive architecture. Here, we ask what\nkinds of common knowledge (semantic memory) are captured by word meanings\n(lexical semantics). We examine a prominent computational model that represents\nwords as vectors in a multidimensional space, such that proximity between\nword-vectors approximates semantic relatedness. Because related words appear in\nsimilar contexts, such spaces - called \"word embeddings\" - can be learned from\npatterns of lexical co-occurrences in natural language. Despite their\npopularity, a fundamental concern about word embeddings is that they appear to\nbe semantically \"rigid\": inter-word proximity captures only overall similarity,\nyet human judgments about object similarities are highly context-dependent and\ninvolve multiple, distinct semantic features. For example, dolphins and\nalligators appear similar in size, but differ in intelligence and\naggressiveness. Could such context-dependent relationships be recovered from\nword embeddings? To address this issue, we introduce a powerful, domain-general\nsolution: \"semantic projection\" of word-vectors onto lines that represent\nvarious object features, like size (the line extending from the word \"small\" to\n\"big\"), intelligence (from \"dumb\" to \"smart\"), or danger (from \"safe\" to\n\"dangerous\"). This method, which is intuitively analogous to placing objects\n\"on a mental scale\" between two extremes, recovers human judgments across a\nrange of object categories and properties. We thus show that word embeddings\ninherit a wealth of common knowledge from word co-occurrence statistics and can\nbe flexibly manipulated to express context-dependent meanings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 02:42:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 06:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

Manual maintenance can be very cumbersome and leave room for errors.\nTrack anomalies like vegetation overgrowth, sun kinks affect the track\nconstruct and result in unequal load transfer, imbalanced lateral forces on\ntracks which causes further deterioration of tracks and can ultimately result\nin derailment of locomotive. Hence there is a need to continuously monitor rail\ntrack health. Track anomalies are rare with the skew as high as one anomaly in\nmillions of good images. We propose a method to build training data that will\nmake our algorithms more robust and help us detect real world track issues. The\ndata augmentation will have a direct effect in making us detect better\nanomalies and hence improve time for railroads that is spent in manual\ninspection. This paper talks about a real world use case of detecting railway\ntrack defects from a camera mounted on a moving locomotive and tracking their\nlocations. The camera is engineered to withstand the environment factors on a\nmoving train and provide a consistent steady image at around 30 frames per\nsecond. An image simulation pipeline of track detection, region of interest\nselection, augmenting image for anomalies is implemented. Training images are\nsimulated for sun kink and vegetation overgrowth.

For the case of\nvegetation overgrowth, the model generalizes well on actual vegetation images,\nthough it was trained and validated solely on simulated images which might have\ndifferent distribution than the actual vegetation.

Effective placement of data centers improves network\nperformance and minimizes clients' perceived latency. The problem of\ndetermining the optimal placement of data centers in a large network is a\nclassical uncapacitated $k$-median problem. Traditional works have focused on\ncentralized algorithms, which requires knowledge of the overall network\ntopology and information about the customers' service demands. Moreover,\ncentralized algorithms are computationally expensive and do not scale well with\nthe size of the network. We propose a fully distributed algorithm with linear\ncomplexity to optimize the locations of data centers. The proposed algorithm\nutilizes an iterative two-step optimization approach. Specifically, in each\niteration, it first partitions the whole network into $k$ regions through a\ndistributed partitioning algorithm; then within each region, it determines the\nlocal approximate optimal location through a distributed message-passing\nalgorithm. When the underlying network is a tree topology, we show that the\noverall cost is monotonically decreasing between successive iterations and the\nproposed algorithm converges in a finite number of iterations.

Here, we quantitatively estimate the time it\ntakes a porous airless body to lose all of its interior ice, based on an\nanalytic solution for the interior temperature field of bodies in stable\norbits. Without latent heat, the average surface temperature, which is lower\nthan the classic effective temperature, is representative of the body interior\nand hence an appropriate temperature to evaluate desiccation time scales. In a\nspherically averaged model, an explicit analytic solution is obtained for the\ndepth to ice as a function of time and the time to complete desiccation. Half\nof the ice volume is lost after 11% of this time. A bilobate structure emerges\nfrom the strong latitude dependence of desiccation rates. Cold polar regions\ncan harbor subsurface ice, even when the body center does not. Latent heat\nretards ice loss, and we obtain a succinct expression for the temperature\ndifference between the surface and the ice. In the outer main belt, nearly all\nbodies 10~km in size or larger should have been able to retain ice in their\ninteriors over the age of the solar system. Each of the following factors\nfavors the presence of ice inside NEOs: a semi-major axis in the outer belt or\nbeyond, a mantle of very low thermal inertia, a young age, or a small and\nstable axis tilt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 07:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Computer systems can assist in\nmelanoma detection, but are not widespread in clinical practice. In 2016, an\nopen challenge in classification of dermoscopic images of skin lesions was\nannounced. A training set of 900 images with corresponding class labels and\nsemi-automatic/manual segmentation masks was released for the challenge. An\nindependent test set of 379 images was used to rank the participants. This\narticle demonstrates the impact of ranking criteria, segmentation method and\nclassifier, and highlights the clinical perspective. We compare five different\nmeasures for diagnostic accuracy by analysing the resulting ranking of the\ncomputer systems in the challenge. Choice of performance measure had great\nimpact on the ranking. Systems that were ranked among the top three for one\nmeasure, dropped to the bottom half when changing performance measure. Nevus\nDoctor, a computer system previously developed by the authors, was used to\ninvestigate the impact of segmentation and classifier. The unexpected small\nimpact of automatic versus semi-automatic/manual segmentation suggests that\nimprovements of the automatic segmentation method w.r.t. resemblance to\nsemi-automatic/manual segmentation will not improve diagnostic accuracy\nsubstantially. A small set of similar classification algorithms are used to\ninvestigate the impact of classifier on the diagnostic accuracy. The\nvariability in diagnostic accuracy for different classifier algorithms was\nlarger than the variability for segmentation methods, and suggests a focus for\nfuture investigations. From a clinical perspective, the misclassification of a\nmelanoma as benign has far greater cost than the misclassification of a benign\nlesion. For computer systems to have clinical impact, their performance should\nbe ranked by a high-sensitivity measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 08:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

Two different devices, a stationary obstacle (inset) and a\ndevice to inject additional fluid through an annular gap close to the wall, are\nused to control the flow. Both devices modify the streamwise velocity profile\nsuch that the flow in the center of the pipe is decelerated and the flow in the\nnear wall region is accelerated. We present measurements with stereoscopic\nparticle image velocimetry to investigate and capture the development of the\nrelaminarizing flow downstream these devices and the specific circumstances\nresponsible for relaminarization. We find total relaminarization up to Reynolds\nnumbers of 6000, where the pressure drop in the downstream distance is reduced\nby a factor of 3.4 due to relaminarization. In a smooth straight pipe the flow\nremains completely laminar downstream of the control. Furthermore, we show that\ntransient (temporary) relaminarization in a spatially confined region right\ndownstream the devices occurs also at much higher Reynolds numbers, accompanied\nby a significant drag reduction. The underlying physical mechanism of\nrelaminarization is attributed to a weakening of the near-wall turbulence\nproduction cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 10:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

Our approach to it involves a\nteam of cooperating micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) with on-board cameras only.\nThe key enabling-aspect of our approach is the on-board person detection and\ntracking method. Recent state-of-the-art methods based on deep neural networks\n(DNN) are highly promising in this context. However, real time DNNs are\nseverely constrained in input data dimensions, in contrast to available camera\nresolutions. Therefore, DNNs often fail at objects with small scale or far away\nfrom the camera, which are typical characteristics of a scenario with aerial\nrobots. Thus, the core problem addressed in this paper is how to achieve\non-board, real-time, continuous and accurate vision-based detections using DNNs\nfor visual person tracking through MAVs. Our solution leverages cooperation\namong multiple MAVs. First, each MAV fuses its own detections with those\nobtained by other MAVs to perform cooperative visual tracking. This allows for\npredicting future poses of the tracked person, which are used to selectively\nprocess only the relevant regions of future images, even at high resolutions.\nConsequently, using our DNN-based detector we are able to continuously track\neven distant humans with high accuracy and speed. We demonstrate the efficiency\nof our approach through real robot experiments involving two aerial robots\ntracking a person, while maintaining an active perception-driven formation. Our\nsolution runs fully on-board our MAV's CPU and GPU, with no remote processing.\nROS-based source code is provided for the benefit of the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 10:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

We report on measurements\nperformed with a suite of dedicated beam background detectors, collectively\nknown as BEAST II, during the so-called Phase 1 commissioning run of SuperKEKB\nin 2016, which involved operation of both the high energy ring (HER) of 7 GeV\nelectrons as well as the low energy ring (LER) of 4 GeV positrons. We describe\nthe BEAST II detector systems, the simulation of beam backgrounds, and the\nmeasurements performed. The measurements include standard ones of dose rates\nversus accelerator conditions, and more novel investigations, such as\nbunch-by-bunch measurements of injection backgrounds and measurements sensitive\nto the energy spectrum and angular distribution of fast neutrons. We observe\nbeam-gas, Touschek, beam-dust, and injection backgrounds. We do not observe\nsignificant synchrotron radiation, as expected. Measured LER beam-gas\nbackgrounds and Touschek backgrounds in both rings are slightly elevated, on\naverage three times larger than the levels predicted by simulation. HER\nbeam-gas backgrounds are on on average two orders of magnitude larger than\npredicted. Systematic uncertainties and channel-to-channel variations are\nlarge, so that these excesses constitute only 1-2 sigma level effects. Neutron\nbackground rates are higher than predicted and should be studied further. We\nwill measure the remaining beam background processes, due to colliding beams,\nin the imminent commissioning Phase 2.

Deep models, typically over-parametrized,\ntend to fit the training data exactly. Despite this \"overfitting\", they perform\nwell on test data, a phenomenon not yet fully understood.\n  The first point of our paper is that strong performance of overfitted\nclassifiers is not a unique feature of deep learning. Using six real-world and\ntwo synthetic datasets, we establish experimentally that kernel machines\ntrained to have zero classification or near zero regression error perform very\nwell on test data, even when the labels are corrupted with a high level of\nnoise. We proceed to give a lower bound on the norm of zero loss solutions for\nsmooth kernels, showing that they increase nearly exponentially with data size.\nWe point out that this is difficult to reconcile with the existing\ngeneralization bounds. Moreover, none of the bounds produce non-trivial results\nfor interpolating solutions.\n  Second, we show experimentally that (non-smooth) Laplacian kernels easily fit\nrandom labels, a finding that parallels results for ReLU neural networks. In\ncontrast, fitting noisy data requires many more epochs for smooth Gaussian\nkernels. Similar performance of overfitted Laplacian and Gaussian classifiers\non test, suggests that generalization is tied to the properties of the kernel\nfunction rather than the optimization process.\n  Certain key phenomena of deep learning are manifested similarly in kernel\nmethods in the modern \"overfitted\" regime. The combination of the experimental\nand theoretical results presented in this paper indicates a need for new\ntheoretical ideas for understanding properties of classical kernel methods. We\nargue that progress on understanding deep learning will be difficult until more\ntractable \"shallow\" kernel methods are better understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 14:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 18:19:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 21:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-18"}

However, standard non-inferiority designs have several\nlimitations, including arbitrariness of non-inferiority margins, choice of\nresearch arms and very large sample sizes.\n  Methods: we recast the problem of finding an appropriate non-inferior\ntreatment duration in terms of modelling the entire duration-response curve\nwithin a pre-specified range. We propose a multi-arm randomised trial design,\nallocating patients to different treatment durations. We use fractional\npolynomials and spline-based methods to flexibly model the duration-response\ncurve. We compare different methods in terms of a scaled version of the area\nbetween true and estimated prediction curves. We evaluate sensitivity to key\ndesign parameters, including sample size, number and position of arms.\n  Results: a total sample size of $\\sim 500$ patients divided into a moderate\nnumber of equidistant arms (5-7) is sufficient to estimate the\nduration-response curve within a $5\\%$ error margin in $95\\%$ of the\nsimulations. Fractional polynomials provide similar or better results than\nspline-based methods in most scenarios.\n  Conclusions: our proposed practical randomised trial design is an alternative\nto standard non-inferiority designs, avoiding many of their limitations, and\nyet being fairly robust to different possible duration-response curves.

Our\nfavoured model with an accelerating wind provides a self-consistent solution,\nwhere the magnetic field is in energy equipartition with both the warm neutral\nand warm ionized medium with an important contribution from cosmic rays.\nConsequently, cosmic rays can play a vital role for the launching of galactic\nwinds in the disc--halo interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 15:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

A few recent\nresearch studies discuss the feasibility of processing data gathered by a\nsmartphone to locate the phone's owner, even when the user does not intend to\nshare his location information, e.g., when the Global Positioning System (GPS)\nis off. Previous research efforts rely on at least one of the two following\nfundamental requirements, which significantly limit the ability of the\nadversary: (i) the attacker must accurately know either the user's initial\nlocation or the set of routes through which the user travels and/or (ii) the\nattacker must measure a set of features, e.g., the device's acceleration, for\npotential routes in advance and construct a training dataset.

However, a\nsignificant part of this energy is dissipated as heat. Plasmonic losses present\na major hurdle in the development of plasmonic devices and circuits that can\ncompete with other mature technologies. Until recently, they have largely kept\nthe use of plasmonics to a few niche areas where loss is not a key factor, such\nas surface enhanced Raman scattering and biochemical sensing. Here, we discuss\nthe origin of plasmonic losses and various approaches to either minimize or\nmitigate them based on understanding of fundamental processes underlying\nsurface plasmon modes excitation and decay. Along with the ongoing effort to\nfind and synthesize better plasmonic materials, optical designs that modify the\noptical powerflow through plasmonic nanostructures can help in reducing both\nradiative damping and dissipative losses of surface plasmons. Another strategy\nrelies on the development of hybrid photonic-plasmonic devices by coupling\nplasmonic nanostructures to resonant optical elements. Hybrid integration not\nonly helps to reduce dissipative losses and radiative damping of surface\nplasmons, but also makes possible passive radiative cooling of nano-devices.\nFinally, we review emerging applications of thermoplasmonics that leverage\nOhmic losses to achieve new enhanced functionalities. The most successful\ncommercialized example of a loss-enabled novel application of plasmonics is\nheat-assisted magnetic recording. Other promising technological directions\ninclude thermal emission manipulation, cancer therapy, nanofabrication,\nnano-manipulation, plasmon-enabled material spectroscopy and thermo-catalysis,\nand solar water treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 15:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

Skin cancers are the most common types of cancers, melanoma being\nthe deadliest among them. RCM is an effective, non-invasive pre-screening tool\nfor skin cancer diagnosis, with the required cellular resolution. However,\nimages are complex, low-contrast, and highly variable, so that clinicians\nrequire months to years of expert-level training to be able to make accurate\nassessments. In this paper, we address classifying 4 key clinically important\nstructural/textural patterns in RCM images. The occurrence and morphology of\nthese patterns are used by clinicians for diagnosis of melanomas. The large\nsize of RCM images, the large variance of pattern size, the large-scale range\nover which patterns appear, the class imbalance in collected images, and the\nlack of fully-labeled images all make this a challenging problem to address,\neven with automated machine learning tools. We designed a novel nested U-net\narchitecture to cope with these challenges, and a selective loss function to\nhandle partial labeling. Trained and tested on 56 melanoma-suspicious,\npartially labeled, 12k x 12k pixel images, our network automatically annotated\ndiagnostic patterns with high sensitivity and specificity, providing consistent\nlabels for unlabeled sections of the test images. Providing such annotation\nwill aid clinicians in achieving diagnostic accuracy, and perhaps more\nimportant, dramatically facilitate clinical training, thus enabling much more\nrapid adoption of RCM into widespread clinical use process.

In this paper, we\nexplore the performance of two hybrid artifact removal algorithms: Wavelet\npacket transform followed by Independent Component Analysis (WPTICA) and\nWavelet Packet Transform followed by Empirical Mode Decomposition (WPTEMD) in\npervasive EEG recording scenario, assuming existence of no a priori knowledge\nabout the artifacts and compare their performance with two existing artifact\nremoval algorithms. Artifact cleaning performance has been measured using Root\nMean Square Error (RMSE) and Artifact to Signal Ratio (ASR) - an index similar\nto traditional Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and also by observing normalized\npower distribution topography over the scalp. Comparison has been made first\nusing semi-simulated signals and then with real experimentally acquired EEG\ndata with commercially available 19-channel pervasive EEG system Enobio\ncorrupted by eight types of artifact. Our explorations show that WPTEMD\nconsistently gives best artifact cleaning performance not only in\nsemi-simulated scenario but also in the case of real EEG data containing\nartifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 13:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

One of the major issues in cloud computing is the difficulty\nto manage federated identities and the trust between the user and the service\nproviders. This paper focuses on how security can be provided between the user\nand the service provider and how the user information can be authenticated. For\nthe purpose of providing privacy and authentication, Security Assertion Markup\nLanguage (SAML) based Single Sign-On is used. Security is provided by using\nHash based Encryption algorithm (HBE). HBE algorithm works with the help of Key\nExchange Protocol which contains poly hash function. In the algorithm, Identity\nproviders maintain user directory and authenticates user information; service\nprovider provides the service to users. The user has to register their details\nwith the identity provider prior to this. During this stage, Hash based\nEncryption algorithm is used to provide secure communication between the\nidentity provider and the user. In this paper we suggest that higher security\ncan be given to user login by using an additional cryptographic technique, i.e.\nHash based Encryption algorithm with the help of the Key Exchange Protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 15:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}
