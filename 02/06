For the simplest iron-based superconductor FeSe (with transition\ntemperature Tc ~ 8 K), its Tc can be greatly enhanced by doping electrons via\nmany routes, even up to 65 K in monolayer FeSe/SiTiO3. However, a clear phase\ndiagram with carrier concentration for FeSe-derived superconductors is still\nlacking. Here, we report the observation of a series of discrete\nsuperconducting phases in FeSe thin flakes by continuously tuning carrier\nconcentration through the intercalation of Li and Na ions with a solid ionic\ngating technique. Such discrete superconducting phases are robust against the\nsubstitution of Se by 20% S, but are vulnerable to the substitution of Fe by 2%\nCu, highlighting the importance of the iron site being intact. A complete\nsuperconducting phase diagram for FeSe-derivatives is given, which is distinct\nfrom other unconventional superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 16:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

The increasing installation of DG raises the question\nif the currently used concepts are still optimal for future power systems. We\npresent a methodology that allows the automated calculation and comparison of\ntarget grids within different concepts. Specifically, we consider radial grids,\nclosed ring grids and grids with switching stations. A target grid structure is\noptimized for each of those grid concepts based on geographical information. To\nmodel a realistic planning process, compliance with technical constraints for\nnormal operation, contingency behaviour and reliability figures are ensured in\nall grid concepts. We present a multiphase approach to solve the optimization\nproblem based on an iterated local search meta-heuristic. We then economically\ncompare the grids with regards to CAPEX and OPEX for primary and secondary\nequipment, to analyse which concept leads to the most overall cost-efficient\ntarget grids. Since the methodology allows an automated evaluation of a large\nnumber of grids, it can be used to draw general conclusions about the\ncost-efficiency of specific concepts. The methodology is applied to 44 real MV\ngrids spanning about 4800km of lines, for which the results show that a radial\ngrid structure is overall cost efficient compared to grid topologies with\nswitching stations or closed rings even in grid areas with a large DG\npenetration. The contribution of this paper is threefold: first, a\ncomprehensive methodology to compile automated target grid plans under\nrealistic premises is presented. Second, the practical applicability of the\napproach is demonstrated with a large scale case study with a high degree of\nautomation. And third, the results of the case study allow to draw conclusions\nabout the techno-economical differences of different MV grid concepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 16:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

We characterise the type III burst\nfrequency-time evolution using the enhanced resolution of LOFAR in the\nfrequency range 30 to 70 MHz and use this to probe electron beam dynamics.\nMethods. The rise, peak and decay times with a 0.2 MHz spectral resolution were\ndefined for a collection of 31 type III bursts. The frequency evolution is used\nto ascertain the apparent velocities of the front, middle and back of the type\nIII sources and the trends are interpreted using theoretical and numerical\ntreatments. The type III time profile was better approximated by an asymmetric\nGaussian profile, not an exponential as previously used. Rise and decay times\nincreased with decreasing frequency and showed a strong correlation. Durations\nwere smaller than previously observed. Drift rates from the rise times were\nfaster than from the decay times, corresponding to inferred mean electron beam\nspeeds for the front, middle and back of 0.2, 0.17, 0, 15 c, respectively.\nFaster beam speeds correlate with smaller type III durations. We also find type\nIII frequency bandwidth decreases as frequency decreases. The different speeds\nnaturally explain the elongation of an electron beam in space as it propagates\nthrough the heliosphere. The rate of expansion is proportional to the mean\nspeed of the exciter; faster beams expand faster. Beam speeds are attributed to\nvarying ensembles of electron energies at the front, middle and back of the\nbeam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 16:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

The code can be written in different languages with the common\npurpose of implementing various kinds of transactions onto the hosting\nblockchain, They are ruled by the blockchain infrastructure and work in order\nto satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The software code must\nsatisfy constrains strongly context dependent which are quite different from\ntraditional software code. In particular, since the bytecode is uploaded in the\nhosting blockchain, size, computational resources, interaction between\ndifferent parts of software are all limited and even if the specific software\nlanguages implement more or less the same constructs of traditional languages\nthere is not the same freedom as in normal software development.

We tested this hypothesis on the code of more\nthan twelve thousands SC written in Solidity and uploaded on the Ethereum\nblockchain.

With this, even where no arguments in a cycle could be\nselected sensibly, we could say more about arguments acceptability of an\nargument framework that contains it. In a certain sense, we can verify Dung\nextensions with respect to a semantic structure in this hybrid theory, to\nconsolidate our confidence in their suitability. By defining the theory, and by\nmaking comparisons to existing approaches, we ultimately discover that whether\nDung semantics, or an alternative semantics such as cf2, is adequate or\nproblematic depends not just on an argument graph but also on the semantic\nrelation among the arguments in the graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 17:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

For this key performance indicator, we perform a\nrealistic comparison between existing deployments operating in single-user mode\nand next-generation multi-user massive MIMO systems. We find that in\nsingle-user deployments under heavy data traffic, UAVs flying at 50 m, 150 m,\nand 300 m achieve the C&C target rate of 100 kbps -- as set by the 3GPP -- in a\nmere 35%, 2%, and 1% of the cases, respectively. Owing to mitigated\ninterference, a stronger carrier signal, and a spatial multiplexing gain,\nmassive MIMO time division duplex systems can dramatically increase such\nprobability.

We measure the\ndistortion by comparing the local voltage drop at the spine (expressed as the\nresistance $R_{spine}$) with that at the edge ($R_{edge}$). In Bi, $R_{spine}$\nsharply increases with $B$ but $R_{edge}$ decreases (jetting effects are\ndominant). However, in Na$_3$Bi and GdPtBi, both $R_{spine}$ and $R_{edge}$\ndecrease (jetting effects are subdominant). A numerical simulation allows the\njetting distortions to be removed entirely. We find that the intrinsic\nlongitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ in Na$_3$Bi decreases by a factor of\n10.9 between $B$ = 0 and 10 T. A second litmus test is obtained from the\nparametric plot of the planar angular magnetoresistance. These results\nstrenghthen considerably the evidence for the intrinsic nature of the\nchiral-anomaly induced LMR. We briefly discuss how the squeeze test may be\nextended to test ZrTe$_5$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 18:13:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 16:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

We show that a unified theory of the diverse broken symmetry states\nnecessarily requires explicit incorporation of strong electron-electron\ninteractions and lattice discreteness, and most importantly, the correct\nbandfilling of one-quarter. Uniquely in the quarter-filled band, there is a\nvery strong tendency to form nearest neighbor spin-singlets, in both one and\ntwo dimensions. The tendency to spin-singlets, a quantum effect, drives a\ncommensurate charge-order in the correlated quarter-filled band. This\ncharge-ordered spin-singlet, which we label as a paired-electron crystal (PEC),\nis different from and competes with both the antiferromagnetic state and the\nWigner crystal of single electrons. Further, unlike these classical broken\nsymmetries, the PEC is characterized by a spin gap. The tendency to the PEC in\ntwo dimensions is enhanced by lattice frustration. Following this\ncharacterization of the spatial broken symmetries, we critically reexamine\nspin-fluctuation and resonating valence bond theories of frustration-driven SC\nwithin half-filled band Hubbard and Hubbard-Heisenberg Hamiltonians for the\nsuperconducting CTS. We develop a valence-bond theory of SC within which the\nsuperconducting state is reached by the destabilization of the PEC by\nadditional pressure-induced lattice frustration that makes the spin-singlets\nmobile. Our proposed mechanism for SC is the same for CTS in which the\nproximate semiconducting state is antiferromagnetic instead of charge-ordered,\nwith the only difference that SC in the former is generated via a fluctuating\nspin-singlet state as opposed to static PEC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 18:23:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 16:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

We note that its form immediately implies\nthe Markov property of the CFT vacuum (saturation of strong subadditivity) for\nregions bounded on the same lightcone. This gives a holographic proof of the\nresult proven for general CFTs in arXiv:1703.10656. A similar holographic proof\nshows the Markov property for regions bounded on a lightsheet for non-conformal\nholographic theories defined by relevant perturbations of a CFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 21:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Cluster environments also show a corresponding deficit of young,\nlow-mass star-forming galaxies, which show a sharp radial decline towards\ncluster centres. By comparing mass functions and radial distributions, we\nconclude that young star-forming galaxies are rapidly quenched as they enter\noverdense environments, becoming post-starburst galaxies before joining the red\nsequence. Our results also point to the existence of two environmental\nquenching pathways operating in galaxy clusters, operating on different\ntimescales. Fast quenching acts on galaxies with high specific star-formation\nrates, operating on timescales shorter than the cluster dynamical time ($ < 1$\nGyr).

The origin of this large scale strong magnetic field\nnear the event horizon is due to the advection of the magnetic flux by the\naccreting gas from the environment, say, the interstellar medium or a companion\nstar, because of flux freezing. In this simplest vertically averaged,\n1.5-dimensional disc model, we choose the maximum upper limit of the magnetic\nfield, which the disc around a black hole can sustain. In this so called\nmagnetically arrested disc (MAD) model, the accreting gas either decelerates or\nfaces the magnetic barrier near the event horizon by the accumulated magnetic\nfield depending on the geometry. The magnetic barrier may knock the matter to\ninfinity. We suggest that these types of flow are the building block to produce\njets and outflows in the accreting system. We also find that in some cases,\nwhen matter is trying to go back to infinity after knocking the barrier, matter\nis prevented being escaped by the cumulative action of strong gravity and the\nmagnetic tension, hence by another barrier. In this way, magnetic field can\nlock the matter in between these two barriers and it might be a possible\nexplanation for the formation of episodic jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 19:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

The states of the system are then driven asymptotically to this\nadmissible setpoint by the control action of the PSSC. The performance of the\nproposed PSSC is evaluated for an advanced automotive engine case study, where\na high fidelity physics-based model of a reactivity controlled compression\nignition (RCCI) engine is utilized to serve as the virtual test-bed for the\nsimulations. Considering the hard physical constraints on the RCCI engine\nstates and control inputs, simultaneous tracking of engine load and optimal\ncombustion phasing is a challenging objective to achieve. The simulation\nresults of testing the proposed PSSC on the high fidelity RCCI model show that\nthe developed predictive controller is able to track desired engine load and\ncombustion phasing setpoints, with minimum steady state error, and no\novershoot.

In combination with China's emission control and clean air\ninitiatives, it has resulted in large-scale expansion of the leading renewable\nenergy technologies, wind and solar power. Their intermittent nature and uneven\ngeographic distribution, however, raises the question of how to best exploit\nthem in a future sustainable electricity system, where their combined\nproduction may very well exceed that of all other technologies. It is well\nknown that interconnecting distant regions provides more favorable production\npatterns from wind and solar. On the other hand, long-distance connections\nchallenge traditional local energy autonomy. In this paper, the advantage of\ninterconnecting the contiguous provinces of China is quantified. To this end,\ntwo different methodologies are introduced. The first aims at gradually\nincreasing heterogeneity, that is non-local wind and solar power production, to\nminimize production costs without regard to the match between production and\ndemand. The second method optimizes the trade-off between low cost production\nand high utility value of the energy. In both cases, the study of a 100%\nrenewable Chinese electricity network is based on 8 years of high-resolution\nhourly time series of wind and solar power generation and electricity demand\nfor each of the provinces. From the study we conclude that compared to a\nbaseline design of homogeneously distributed renewable capacities, a\nheterogeneous network not only lowers capital investments but also reduces\nbackup dispatches from thermal units.

The resulting FEM exhibits both a geometric\nconsistency error due to the surface approximation and a standard Galerkin\nerror. A posteriori estimates for SFEM require practical access to geometric\ninformation about the surface in order to computably bound the geometric error.\nIt is thus advantageous to allow for maximum flexibility in representing\nsurfaces in practical codes when proving a posteriori error estimates for SFEM.\nHowever, previous a posteriori estimates using general parametric surface\nrepresentations are suboptimal by one order on $C^2$ surfaces.

In particular for quasiperiodic variations\nof the inter-chain coupling, the phase diagram reproduces Hofstadter's\nbutterfly pattern. We thus identify the SSH ladder system as a potential\ncandidate for experimental observation of such fractal structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 20:15:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 23:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Unabated,\nespecially when using highly coherent light sources for wavelength calibration,\nmodal noise can induce radial velocity (RV) errors that hinder the discovery of\nlow-mass (and potentially Earth-like) planets. Previous research in this field\nhas found sufficient modal noise mitigation through the use of an integrating\nsphere, but this requires extremely bright light sources, a luxury not\nnecessarily afforded by the next generation of high-resolution optical\nspectrographs. Otherwise, mechanical agitation, which \"mixes\" the fiber's modal\npatterns and allows the noise to be averaged over minutes-long exposures,\nprovides some noise reduction but the exact mechanism behind improvement in\nsignal-to-noise and RV drift has not been fully explored or optimized by the\ncommunity. Therefore, we have filled out the parameter space of modal noise\nagitation techniques in order to better understand agitation's contribution to\nmitigating modal noise and to discover a better method for agitating fibers. We\nfind that modal noise is best suppressed by the quasi-chaotic motion of two\nhigh-amplitude agitators oscillating with varying phase for fibers with large\ncore diameters and low azimuthal symmetry.

Experiments of exchange flows in closed vertical tubes have\nbeen used as surrogates to elucidate the basic features of such flows. The\nresulting data have historically been analyzed and interpreted through\ncore-annular flow solutions, the most common flow configuration at finite\nviscosity contrasts. These models have been successful in fitting experimental\ndata, but less effective at explaining the variability observed in natural\nsystems. In this paper, we formulate a core-annular solution to the classical\nproblem of buoyancy-driven exchange flows in vertical tubes. The model posits\nthe existence of two mathematically valid solutions, i.e. thin- and thick-core\nsolutions. The theoretical existence of two solutions, however, does not\nnecessarily imply that the system is bistable in the sense that flow switching\nmay occur. Using direct numerical simulations, we test the hypothesis that\ncore-annular flow in vertical tubes is bistable, which implies that the\nrealized flow field is not uniquely defined by the material parameters of the\nflow. Our numerical experiments, which fully predict experimental data without\nfitting parameters, demonstrate that buoyancy-driven exchange flows are indeed\ninherently bistable systems. This finding is consistent with previous\nexperimental data, but in contrast to the underlying hypothesis of previous\nanalytical models that the solution is unique and can be identified by\nmaximizing the flux or extremizing the dissipation in the system. These results\nhave important implications for data interpretation by analytical models, and\nmay also have relevant ramifications for understanding volcanic degassing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 20:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

This work investigates the methods for and\nlimitations in determining passbands from photometric observations. A simple\ngeneral formalism for passband determinations from photometric measurements is\nderived. The results are applied to the passbands of HIPPARCOS, Tycho, and Gaia\nDR1. The problem of passband determination is formulated in a basic functional\nanalytic framework. For the solution of the resulting equations, functional\nprincipal component analysis is applied. We find that, given a set of\ncalibration sources, the passband can be described with respect to the set of\ncalibration sources as the sum of two functions, one which is uniquely\ndetermined by the set of calibration sources, and one which is entirely\nunconstrained. The constrained components for the HIPPARCOS, Tycho, and Gaia\nDR1 passbands are determined, and the unconstrained components are estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 21:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Feller's technique is restricted to diffusion\nprocesses as the corresponding differential generators allow explicit\ncomputations and the use of Hille-Yosida theory. In the present article we\nstudy exit and entrance from infinity for the most natural generalization, that\nis, jump diffusions of the form \\[\n  dZ_t=\\sigma(Z_{t-})\\,dX_t, \\] driven by stable L\\'evy processes for\n$\\alpha\\in (0,2)$. Many results have been proved for jump diffusions, employing\na variety of techniques developed after Feller's work but exit and entrance\nfrom infinite boundaries has long remained open.

When solving the MLC problems, we\ngenerally expect the learning algorithm to take the hidden correlation of the\nlabels into account to improve the prediction performance. Extracting the\nhidden correlation is generally a challenging task. In this work, we propose a\nnovel deep learning framework to better extract the hidden correlation with the\nhelp of the memory structure within recurrent neural networks. The memory\nstores the temporary guesses on the labels and effectively allows the framework\nto rethink about the goodness and correlation of the guesses before making the\nfinal prediction. Furthermore, the rethinking process makes it easy to adapt to\ndifferent evaluation criteria to match real-world application needs. In\nparticular, the framework can be trained in an end-to-end style with respect to\nany given MLC evaluation criteria. The end-to-end design can be seamlessly\ncombined with other deep learning techniques to conquer challenging MLC\nproblems like image tagging. Experimental results across many real-world data\nsets justify that the rethinking framework indeed improves MLC performance\nacross different evaluation criteria and leads to superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art MLC algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 21:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 07:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

Although capacity expansion\nhad been traditionally well noticed as a congestion mitigation measure, but it\nwas not until recently that capacity reduction measures such as; congestion\npricing, road diet and other such capacity reduction measures were noticed as\ncongestion mitigation measures. Measures such as signal optimization, metering\nand congestion pricing are intended to affect the travel pattern and assignment\nbehavior of travelers to make the results of the User Equilibrium (UE) traffic\nassignment, followed by the travelers, closer to the System Optimal (SO)\noutcomes, intended by the planners. As such, a bi-level optimization model was\nformulated for the simultaneous optimization of capacity improvement/expansion\nand signal timing in an urban transportation network. The model takes into\naccount both the effect of higher demand, induced by the capacity expansion,\nand the rerouting potential effect of traffic signals. The solution algorithm\ndeveloped here consists of two major components; the gradient projection\nalgorithm (GP) to solve the lower level traffic assignment problem and the\nSimulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to solve the master problem. In order to\nillustrate the method a case study was examined. The analysis and application\nof the proposed algorithm shows that the performance function gradually\nconverged along the simulation run, and no divergence problem is observed. By\napplying the developed algorithm, the total network travel time reduced by\n13.42%, in which 5.76% is reached by only optimizing the signal times.

This is particularly\nfactual knowing that the infrastructure tends to be highly diversified\nespecially with the continuous deployment of small cells. In fact, frequent\nhandovers in these cells introduce unnecessarily recurring authentications\nleading to increased latency. In this paper, we propose a software-defined\nwireless network (SDWN)-enabled fast cross-authentication scheme which combines\nnon-cryptographic and cryptographic algorithms to address the challenges of\nlatency and weak security. Initially, the received radio signal strength\nvectors at the mobile terminal (MT) is used as a fingerprinting source to\ngenerate an unpredictable secret key. Subsequently, a cryptographic mechanism\nbased upon the authentication and key agreement protocol by employing the\ngenerated secret key is performed in order to improve the confidentiality and\nintegrity of the authentication handover. Further, we propose a radio trusted\nzone database aiming to enhance the frequent authentication of radio devices\nwhich are present in the network. In order to reduce recurring authentications,\na given covered area is divided into trusted zones where each zone contains\nmore than one small cell, thus permitting the MT to initiate a single\nauthentication request per zone, even if it keeps roaming between different\ncells. The proposed scheme is analyzed under different attack scenarios and its\ncomplexity is compared with cryptographic and non-cryptographic approaches to\ndemonstrate its security resilience and computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 22:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

A relativistic mean field model and the\nquark-meson coupling model are respectively adopted for the in-medium effective\nnucleon mass and nucleon form factors. We find that the cross sections of\nneutrino scattering in cold nuclear medium decreases when the in-medium\nmodification of the nucleon weak and electromagnetic form factors are taken\ninto account. This reduction results in the enhancement of the neutrino mean\nfree path, in particular at the baryon density of around a few times of the\nnormal nuclear matter density. The enhancement of the neutrino mean free path\nis estimated to be about 10--40\\% compared with the values obtained without the\nmedium modification of the nucleon form factors, and the enhancement is\nexpected to accelerate the cooling of neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 00:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 00:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

In contexts where an agent interacts with\nmultiple entities, utility decomposition can be used to separate the global\nobjective into local tasks considering each individual entity independently. An\narbitrator is then responsible for combining the individual utilities and\nselecting an action in real time to solve the global problem. Although these\ntechniques can perform well empirically, they rely on strong assumptions of\nindependence between the local tasks and sacrifice the optimality of the global\nsolution. This paper proposes an approach that improves upon such approximate\nsolutions by learning a correction term represented by a neural network. We\ndemonstrate this approach on a fisheries management problem where multiple\nboats must coordinate to maximize their catch over time as well as on a\npedestrian avoidance problem for autonomous driving. In each problem,\ndecomposition methods can scale to multiple boats or pedestrians by using\nstrategies involving one entity. We verify empirically that the proposed\ncorrection method significantly improves the decomposition method and\noutperforms a policy trained on the full scale problem without utility\ndecomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 03:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 19:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

One crucial benefit of a classifier is the ability to\nreport back a (softmax) distribution over putative alignments. We demonstrate\nthat this distribution is a rich representation that can be marginalized (to\ngenerate uncertainty estimates over groups of landmarks) and conditioned on (to\nincorporate top-down context, provided by temporal constraints in a video\nstream or an interactive human user). Such capabilities are difficult to\nintegrate into classic regression-based approaches. We study performance as a\nfunction of the number of classes $K$, including the extreme \"exemplar class\"\nsetting where $K$ is equal to the number of training examples (140K in our\nsetting). Perhaps surprisingly, we show that classifiers can still be learned\nin this setting.

The\nproposed approach has effectively been deployed on millions of tweets to\nanalyze economic concerns of people during the 2012 US presidential election.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 03:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

However, verifying the\ncorrectness of programs with asynchronous nested callbacks is quite difficult,\nand, hence, runtime monitoring can be a valuable support to tackle such a\ncomplex task.\n  Runtime monitoring is a useful software verification technique that\ncomplements static analysis and testing, but has not been yet fully explored in\nthe context of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Trace expressions have been\nsuccessfully employed for runtime monitoring in widespread multiagent system\nplatforms. Recently, their expressive power has been extended to allow\nparametric specifications on data that can be captured and monitored only at\nruntime. Furthermore, they can be language and system agnostic, through the\nnotion of event domain and type. This paper investigates the use of parametric\ntrace expressions as a first step towards runtime monitoring of programs\ndeveloped in Node.js and Node-RED, a flow-based IoT programming tool built on\ntop of Node.js. Runtime verification of such systems is a task that mostly\nseems to have been overlooked so far in the literature.\n  A prototype implementing the proposed system for Node.js, in order to\ndynamically check with trace expressions the correct usage of API functions, is\npresented. The tool exploits the dynamic analysis framework Jalangi for\nmonitoring Node.js programs and allows detection of errors that would be\ndifficult to catch with other techniques. Furthermore, it offers a simple REST\ninterface which can be exploited for runtime verification of Node-RED\ncomponents, and, more generally, IoT devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 04:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

One particular class of temporal dynamics is\npersistent and transient signals, i.e. signals of long and short durations\nrespectively. It has been shown that the coherent type-1 feedforward loop with\nan AND logic at the output (or C1-FFL for short) can be used to discriminate a\npersistent input signal from a transient one. This has been done by modelling\nthe C1-FFL, and then use the model to show that persistent and transient input\nsignals give, respectively, a non-zero and zero output. Instead of assuming the\nstructure of C1-FFL, this paper shows that it is possible to deduce the C1-FFL\nmodel from the requirement of discriminating a persistent signal. We do this by\nfirst formulating a statistical detection problem of distinguishing persistent\nsignals from transient ones. The solution of the detection problem is to\ncompute the log-likelihood ratio of observing a persistent signal to a\ntransient signal. We show that, if this log-likelihood ratio is positive, which\nhappens when the signal is likely to be persistent, then it can be\napproximately computed by a C1-FFL. Although the capability of C1-FFL to\ndiscriminate persistent signals is known, this paper adds an information\nprocessing interpretation on how a C1-FFL works as a detector of persistent\nsignals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 05:44:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 May 2018 14:08:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 10:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

We also identify the existence of artifacts due to masking and\ninterpolation procedures at the wavelengths of the hydrogen Balmer series\nleading to the existence of artificial Balmer $\\alpha$ absorption in all SDSS\noptical spectra. All these effects occur in the rest-frame of the standard\nstars and therefore present Galactic longitude variations due to the rotation\nof the Galaxy. We demonstrate that the detection of certain weak absorption\nlines reported in the literature are solely due to calibration effects.\nFinally, we discuss new strategies to mitigate these issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 07:13:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 17:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

A linear hypergraph is one in which\nevery two distinct edges intersect in at most one vertex. A $k$-uniform\nhypergraph has all edges of size $k$. It is known that $\\tau(H) \\le (n +\nm)/(k+1)$ holds for all $k$-uniform, linear hypergraphs $H$ when $k \\in\n\\{2,3\\}$ or when $k \\ge 4$ and the maximum degree of $H$ is at most two. It has\nbeen conjectured that $\\tau(H) \\le (n+m)/(k+1)$ holds for all $k$-uniform,\nlinear hypergraphs $H$. We disprove the conjecture for large $k$, and show that\nthe best possible constant $c_k$ in the bound $\\tau(H) \\le c_k (n+m)$ has order\n$\\ln(k)/k$ for both linear (which we show in this paper) and non-linear\nhypergraphs. We show that for those $k$ where the conjecture holds, it is tight\nfor a large number of densities if there exists an affine plane $AG(2,k)$ of\norder $k \\ge 2$. We raise the problem to find the smallest value, $k_{\\min}$,\nof $k$ for which the conjecture fails. We prove a general result, which when\napplied to a projective plane of order $331$ shows that $k_{\\min} \\le 166$.\nEven though the conjecture fails for large $k$, our main result is that it\nstill holds for $k=4$, implying that $k_{\\min} \\ge 5$. The case $k=4$ is much\nmore difficult than the cases $k \\in \\{2,3\\}$, as the conjecture does not hold\nfor general (non-linear) hypergraphs when $k=4$. Key to our proof is the\ncompletely new technique of the deficiency of a hypergraph introduced in this\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 07:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Do neurons encode\ninformation through relatively slow changes in the emission rates of individual\nspikes (rate code), or by the precise timing of every spike (temporal codes)?\nHere we compare the loss of information due to correlations for these two\npossible neural codes. The essence of Shannon's definition of information is to\ncombine information with uncertainty: the higher the uncertainty of a given\nevent, the more information is conveyed by that event. Correlations can reduce\nuncertainty or the amount of information, but by how much? In this paper we\naddress this question by a direct comparison of the information per symbol\nconveyed by the words coming from a binary Markov source (temporal codes) with\nthe information per symbol coming from the corresponding Bernoulli source\n(uncorrelated, rate code source). In a previous paper we found that a crucial\nrole in the relation between Information Transmission Rates (ITR) and Firing\nRates is played by a parameter s, which is the sum of transitions probabilities\nfrom the no-spike-state to the spike-state and vice versa. It turned out that\nalso in this case a crucial role is played by the same parameter s. We found\nbounds of the quotient of ITRs for these sources, i.e. this quotient's minimal\nand maximal values. Next, making use of the entropy grouping axiom, we\ndetermined the loss of information in a Markov source in relation to its\ncorresponding Bernoulli source for a given length of word. Our results show\nthat in practical situations in the case of correlated signals the loss of\ninformation is relatively small, thus temporal codes, which are more\nenergetically efficient, can replace the rate code effectively.

One particular open question in this context is the\nlocalization of burst emission to a singular active region or a larger area\nacross the neutron star. While several observational studies have attempted to\ninvestigate this question by looking at the phase dependence of burst\nproperties, results have been mixed. At the same time, it is not obvious a\npriori that bursts from a localized active region would actually give rise to a\ndetectable phase-dependence, taking into account issues such as geometry,\nrelativistic effects, and intrinsic burst properties such brightness and\nduration. In this paper, we build a simple theoretical model to investigate the\ncircumstances under which the latter effects could affect detectability of a\ndependence of burst emission on rotational phase. We find that even for\nstrongly phase-dependent emission, inferred burst properties may not show a\nrotational phase dependence depending on the geometry of the system and the\nobserver. Furthermore, the observed properties of bursts with durations short\nas 10-20% of the spin period can vary strongly depending on the rotational\nphase at which the burst was emitted. We also show that detectability of a\nrotational phase dependence depends strongly on the minimum number of bursts\nobserved, and find that existing burst samples may simply be too small to rule\nout a phase dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 11:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

In this work, we consider\ndatasets of images sampled from a low-dimensional manifold (i.e. an\nimage-valued manifold), where the images can assume arbitrary planar rotations.\nTo derive an adaptive and rotation-invariant framework for processing such\ndatasets, we introduce a graph Laplacian (GL)-like operator over the dataset,\ntermed ${\\textit{steerable graph Laplacian}}$. Essentially, the steerable GL\nextends the standard GL by accounting for all (infinitely-many) planar\nrotations of all images. As it turns out, similarly to the standard GL, a\nproperly normalized steerable GL converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on\nthe low-dimensional manifold. However, the steerable GL admits an improved\nconvergence rate compared to the GL, where the improved convergence behaves as\nif the intrinsic dimension of the underlying manifold is lower by one.\nMoreover, it is shown that the steerable GL admits eigenfunctions of the form\nof Fourier modes (along the orbits of the images' rotations) multiplied by\neigenvectors of certain matrices, which can be computed efficiently by the FFT.\nFor image datasets corrupted by noise, we employ a subset of these\neigenfunctions to \"filter\" the dataset via a Fourier-like filtering scheme,\nessentially using all images and their rotations simultaneously. We demonstrate\nour filtering framework by de-noising simulated single-particle cryo-EM image\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 11:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

They are based on a crucial full one order superconvergence of\nthe first order mixed Raviart-Thomas(RT for short) element. The main ingredient\nof such a superconvergence analysis is to employ a discrete Helmholtz\ndecomposition of the difference between the canonical interpolation and the\nfinite element solution of the RT element. In particular, it allows for some\nvital cancellation between terms in one key sum of boundary terms.\nConsequently, a full one order superconvergence follows from a special relation\nbetween the CR element and the RT element, and the equivalence between the ECR\nelement and the RT element for these two nonconforming elements. These\nsuperconvergence results improve those in literature from a half order to a\nfull one order for the RT element, the CR element and the ECR element. Based on\nthe aforementioned superconvergence of the RT element, asymptotic expansions of\neigenvalues are established and employed to achieve high accuracy extrapolation\nmethods for these two nonconforming elements. In contrast to a classic analysis\nin literature, the novelty herein is to use not only the canonical\ninterpolations of these nonconforming elements but also that of the RT element\nto analyze such asymptotic expansions. Based on the superconvergence of these\nnonconforming elements, asymptotically exact a posteriori error estimators of\neigenvalues are constructed and analyzed for them. Finally, two post-processing\nmethods are proposed to improve accuracy of approximate eigenvalues by\nemploying these a posteriori error estimators.Numerical tests are provided to\njustify and compare the performance of the aforementioned methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 12:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The mutual interaction between the air layer\n(plastron) encapsulating the super-hydrophobic spheres and the flow is\nemphasised by studying the hydrodynamic performances. It is found that the air\nplastron adapts its shape to the flow-induced stresses which compete with the\nsurface tension. This competition is characterised by introducing the Weber\nnumber $\\mathcal{W}e$, whilst the plastron deformation is estimated via the\naspect ratio $\\chi$. While noticeable distortions are locally observed, the\nplastron becomes more and more spherical in average (i.e. $\\chi \\rightarrow 1$)\nas far as $\\mathcal{W}e$ increases. In comparison to the reference spheres,\nhigh deformation of the air plastron plastron (oblate shape) leads to lift and\ndrag increase, whereas low deformation (spherical shape) yields lift and drag\nmitigation. Accordingly, taking into account the plastron deformation provides\nan attractive way to explain the somehow discordant results reported in other\nstudies at comparable Reynolds numbers. If confirmed by additional studies, our\nfindings would imply that plastron compliance and its feedback on the flow,\nwhich are currently neglected in most theoretical works and numerical\nsimulations, must be accounted for to design super-hydrophobic surfaces and/or\npredict their performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 13:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The newly engineered artificial atomic systems\n(such as quantum dots and superconducting circuits) proposed for quantum\ninformation processing enjoy strong interaction with same type of systems or\neven with other types in hybrid structures, which is coherently controllable\nand moreover they can be efficiently coupled to radiation fields. We present an\nexact analytic solution for the time evolution of a composite system of two\ninteracting two-level quantum systems coupled to a single mode radiation field,\nwhich can be realized in cavity (circuit) QED. We show how the non-classical\ndynamical properties of the composite system are affected and can be tuned by\nintroducing and varying the mutual coupling between the two systems.\nParticularly, the collapse-revival pattern shows a splitting during the revival\nintervals as the coupling ratio (system-system to system-field) increases,\nwhich is a sign of an interruption in the system-radiation energy exchange\nprocess. Furthermore, the time evolution of the bipartite entanglement between\nthe two systems is found to vary significantly depending on the coupling ratio\nas well as the initial state of the composite system resulting in either an\noscillatory behavior or a collapse-revival like pattern. Increasing the\ncoupling ratio enhances the entanglement, raises its oscillation average value\nand emphasizes the collapse-revival like pattern. However, raising the coupling\nratio beyond unity increases the revival time considerably. The effect of the\nother system parameters such as detuning and radiation field intensity on the\nsystem dynamics has been investigated as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 13:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The LyC escape fraction has been\ndetected with S/N ratio of ~10-120 and is between 44 and 100% for all the\nobserved faint AGNs, with a mean value of 74% at 3.6<z<4.2 and\n-25.1<M1450<-23.3, in agreement with the value found in the literature for much\nbrighter QSOs (M1450<~-26) at the same redshifts. The LyC escape fraction of\nour faint AGNs does not show any dependence on the absolute luminosities or on\nthe observed U-I colors. Assuming that the LyC escape fraction remains close to\n~75% down to M1450~-18, we find that the AGN population can provide between 16\nand 73% (depending on the adopted luminosity function) of the whole ionizing UV\nbackground at z~4, measured through the Lyman forest. This contribution\nincreases to 25-100% if other determinations of the ionizing UV background are\nadopted. Extrapolating these results to z~5-7, there are possible indications\nthat bright QSOs and faint AGNs can provide a significant contribution to the\nreionization of the Universe, if their space density is high at M1450~-23.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 14:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

The evolution is driven by multiplicative stochastic\nfluctuations governed by the law of proportionate growth and interactions\nbetween agents. We are mainly interested in interactions increasing wealth\ninequality that is in a local implementation of the accumulated advantage\nprinciple. Such interactions destabilise the system. They are confronted in the\nmodel with a global regulatory mechanism which reduces wealth inequality. There\nare different scenarios emerging as a net effect of these two competing\nmechanisms. When the effect of the global regulation (economic interventionism)\nis too weak the system is unstable and it never reaches equilibrium. When the\neffect is sufficiently strong the system evolves towards a limiting stationary\ndistribution with a Pareto tail. In between there is a critical phase. In this\nphase the system may evolve towards a steady state with a multimodal wealth\ndistribution. The corresponding cumulative density function has a\ncharacteristic stairway pattern which reflects the effect of economic\nstratification. The stairs represent wealth levels of economic classes\nseparated by wealth gaps. As we show, the pattern is typical for macro-economic\nsystems with a limited economic freedom.

When\nthe speciation process is complete, members of each species are fully\nreproductively isolated from those of the other. During speciation a primary\nbarrier may be supported and eventually superceded by a later appearing\nsecondary barrier. For those holding certain cases of prezygotic isolation to\nbe primary (e.g. elephant cannot copulate with mouse), the onus is to show that\nthey had not been preceded over evolutionary time by periods of postzygotic\nhybrid inviability (genically determined) or sterility (genically or\nchromosomally determined).

After the epoch of major galaxy formation\n(after z~2), the ISM is replenished by stellar mass losses and SN ejecta, at\nthe rate predicted by stellar evolution, and is depleted by star formation; it\nis heated by the thermalization of stellar motions, SNe explosions and the\nmechanical (from winds) and radiative AGN feedback. The models agree well with\nthe observed relations, even for the largely different Lx values at the same\nmass, thanks to the sensitivity of the gas flow to many galaxy properties; this\nholds for models including AGN feedback, and those without. Therefore, the mass\ninput from the stellar population is able to account for a major part of the\nobserved Lx; and AGN feedback, while very important to maintain massive ETGs in\na time-averaged quasi-steady state, keeping low star formation and the black\nhole mass, does not dramatically alter the gas content originating in stellar\nrecycled material. These conclusions are based on theoretical predictions for\nthe stellar population contributions in mass and energy, and on a\nself-consistent modeling of AGN feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 15:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

Thereby we denoise and deconvolve photon counts, while\nsimultaneously decomposing them into diffuse, point-like and uninteresting\nbackground radiation fluxes. The decomposition is based on a probabilistic\nhierarchical Bayesian parameter model within the framework of information field\ntheory (IFT).

There are\nthree such independent terms: a direct current-current interaction and two\ncurvature-mediated (non-minimally coupled), short-range interactions, one of\nwhich changes sign under a parity transformation. These could be interpreted as\nnon-electromagnetic, short-range forces.\n  For the simplest possible theory, with only the metric and the\nelectromagnetic potential 1-form as independent fields, we find a single,\nstable, spherical (spin-0) solution, which due to an integrable singularity at\nthe solution's center, has quantized mass and charge. Its charge is smaller\nthan numeric error, and its mass is set by a new constant in the Lagrangian. It\nhas a small, central core of charge surrounded by a wave of alternatingly\ncharged, spherical shells, where the amplitude of the charge density wave is\ninversely proportional to the radial coordinate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 04:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 05:26:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 01:05:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 15:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 23:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 23:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

When the diffusion coefficient is heterogeneous, this\nadds to the computational costs, and this difficulty is compounded by a\nsingular source term. For singular source terms, the solution does not belong\nto the Sobolev space $H^1$, but to the space $W^{1,p}$ for some $p<2$. Hence,\nthe problem may be reformulated in a distance-weighted Sobolev space. Using\nthis formulation, we develop a method to upscale the multiscale coefficient\nnear the singular sources by incorporating corrections into the coarse-grid.\nUsing a sub-grid correction method, we correct the basis functions in a\ndistance-weighted Sobolev space and show that these corrections can be\ntruncated to design a computationally efficient scheme with optimal convergence\nrates. Due to the nature of the formulation in weighted spaces, the variational\nform must be posed on the cross product of complementary spaces.

It is well-known that utilizing trained models as initial\nweights often achieves lower training error than neural networks that are not\npre-trained. A fine-tuning step helps to reduce both the computational cost and\nimprove performance. Therefore, sharing trained models has been very important\nfor the rapid progress of research and development. In addition, trained models\ncould be important assets for the owner(s) who trained them, hence we regard\ntrained models as intellectual property. In this paper, we propose a digital\nwatermarking technology for ownership authorization of deep neural networks.\nFirst, we formulate a new problem: embedding watermarks into deep neural\nnetworks. We also define requirements, embedding situations, and attack types\non watermarking in deep neural networks. Second, we propose a general framework\nfor embedding a watermark in model parameters, using a parameter regularizer.\nOur approach does not impair the performance of networks into which a watermark\nis placed because the watermark is embedded while training the host network.\nFinally, we perform comprehensive experiments to reveal the potential of\nwatermarking deep neural networks as the basis of this new research effort. We\nshow that our framework can embed a watermark during the training of a deep\nneural network from scratch, and during fine-tuning and distilling, without\nimpairing its performance. The embedded watermark does not disappear even after\nfine-tuning or parameter pruning; the watermark remains complete even after 65%\nof parameters are pruned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 05:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

We\npropose here a new approach to autonomous driving that will re-balance the\nresponsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous driving between\ntraditional automotive manufacturers, infrastructure players, and third-party\nplayers.

This formulation is a very natural\nfit for wireless-network optimisation problems and has great application\npotential since: i) instead of assuming full observability of the network\nstate, it only requires the metric to optimise as input, and ii) it provides\nstrong performance guarantees while making only minimal assumptions about the\nnetwork dynamics.
