This is achieved by\nrevisiting the resource theory defining entanglement, Local Operations and\nClassical Communication (LOCC), placing the focus on the underlying quantum\nnature of the communication channels. Taking the natural elemental operations\nin the resulting generalization of LOCC yields a resource theory that singles\nout coherence in the wire connecting the spatially separated systems as an\noperationally useful resource. The approach naturally allows to consider a\nreduced setting as well, namely the one with only the wire connected to a\nsingle quantum system, which leads to discord-like resources. The general form\nof free operations in this latter setting is derived and presented as a closed\nform. We discuss in what sense the present approach defines a resource theory\nof quantum discord and in which situations such an interpretation is sound --\nand why in general discord is not a resource. This unified and operationally\nmeaningful approach makes transparent many features of entanglement that in\nLOCC might seem surprising, such as the possibility to use a particle to\nentangle two parties, without it ever being entangled with either of them, or\nthat there exist different forms of multipartite entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 16:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Here, the aim is to reduce a q-Coloring input to\nan equivalent but smaller input whose size is provably bounded in terms of\nstructural properties, such as the size of a minimum vertex cover. In this\npaper we settle two open problems about data reduction for q-Coloring.\n  First, we obtain a kernel of bitsize $O(k^{q-1}\\log{k})$ for q-Coloring\nparameterized by Vertex Cover, for any q >= 3. This size bound is optimal up to\n$k^{o(1)}$ factors assuming NP is not a subset of coNP/poly, and improves on\nthe previous-best kernel of size $O(k^q)$. We generalize this result for\ndeciding q-colorability of a graph G, to deciding the existence of a\nhomomorphism from G to an arbitrary fixed graph H. Furthermore, we can replace\nthe parameter vertex cover by the less restrictive parameter twin-cover. We\nprove that H-Coloring parameterized by Twin-Cover has a kernel of size\n$O(k^{\\Delta(H)}\\log k)$.\n  Our second result shows that 3-Coloring does not admit non-trivial\nsparsification: assuming NP is not a subset of coNP/poly, the parameterization\nby the number of vertices n admits no (generalized) kernel of size $O(n^{2-e})$\nfor any e > 0.

We investigate to what\nextent gravity-mode period spacings in slowly pulsating B-type stars observed\nby the Kepler mission can be used to constrain both the shape and extent of\nconvective core overshoot and additional mixing in the radiative envelope. We\ncompute grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for two different\nshapes of convective core overshooting and three shapes of radiative envelope\nmixing. The models in these grids are compared to a set of benchmark models to\nevaluate their capability of mimicking the dipole prograde g-modes of the\nbenchmark models. Through our model comparisons we find that at a central\nhydrogen content of Xc = 0.5, dipole prograde g-modes in the period range 0.8-3\nd are capable of differentiating between step and exponential diffusive\novershooting. This ability disappears towards the terminal age main-sequence at\nXc = 0.1. Furthermore, the g-modes behave the same for the three different\nshapes of radiative envelope mixing considered. However, a constant envelope\nmixing requires a diffusion coefficient near the convective core five times\nhigher than chemical mixing from internal gravity waves to obtain a surface\nnitrogen excess of about 0.5 dex within the main-sequence lifetime. Within\nestimated frequency errors of the Kepler mission, the ability of g-modes to\ndistinguish between step and exponential diffusive overshooting depends on the\nevolutionary stage. Combining information from the average period spacing and\nobserved surface abundances, notably nitrogen, could potentially be used to\nconstrain the shape of mixing in the radiative envelope of massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 16:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Cloud radio access network (CRAN), in which low-complexity remote\nradio heads (RRHs) coordinated by a central unit (CU) are deployed to serve\nusers in a distributed manner, is a cost-effective solution to achieve network\ndensification. However, when operating over a large bandwidth in the mmWave\nfrequencies, the digital fronthaul links in a CRAN would be easily saturated by\nthe large amount of sampled and quantized signals to be transferred between\nRRHs and the CU. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new\narchitecture for mmWave-based CRAN with advanced lens antenna arrays at the\nRRHs. Due to the energy focusing property, lens antenna arrays are effective in\nexploiting the angular sparsity of mmWave channels, and thus help in\nsubstantially reducing the fronthaul rate and simplifying the signal processing\nat the multi-antenna RRHs and the CU, even when the channels are\nfrequency-selective. We consider the uplink transmission in a mmWave CRAN with\nlens antenna arrays and propose a low-complexity quantization bit allocation\nscheme for multiple antennas at each RRH to meet the given fronthaul rate\nconstraint. Further, we propose a channel estimation technique that exploits\nthe energy focusing property of the lens array and can be implemented at the CU\nwith low complexity. Finally, we compare the proposed mmWave CRAN using lens\nantenna arrays with a conventional CRAN using uniform planar arrays at the\nRRHs, and show that the proposed design achieves significant throughput gains,\nyet with much lower complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 17:10:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 12:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

This result, termed ellipse/flow equivalence, provides a stronger\nversion of the well-known result that a linear velocity field maps an ellipse\ninto another ellipse. Moreover, ellipse/flow equivalence is shown to be a\nmanifestation of Stokes' theorem.

General expressions for various\nphysical properties of an elliptical ring of fluid are also derived.

To solve\nthe Einstein Podolsky Rosen 'paradox' the two boundary quantum mechanics is\ntaken as self consistent interpretation of quantum dynamics. The difficulty\nwith this interpretation is to reconcile it with classical physics. To avoid\nmacroscopic backward causation two 'corresponding transition rules' are\nformulated which specify needed properties of macroscopic observations and\nmanipulations. The apparent classical causal decision tree requires to\nunderstand the classically unchosen options. They are taken to occur with an\n'incomplete knowledge' of the boundary states typically in macroscopic\nconsiderations. The precise boundary conditions with given phases then select\nthe actual measured path and this selection is mistaken to happen at the time\nof measurement. The apparent time direction of the decision tree originates in\nan assumed relative proximity to the initial state. Only the far away final\nstate allows for classically distinct options to be selected from.\nCosmologically the picture could correspond to a big bang initial and a hugely\nextended final state scenario.

The strongest mass bounds on\nthe neutralinos from gluino and squark decays are 1150 and 575 GeV,\nrespectively. The search also provides sensitivity to simplified models\ninspired by split SUSY that involve the production and decay of long-lived\ngluinos. Values of the proper decay length $c\\tau$ from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{5}$\nmm are considered, as well as a metastable gluino scenario. Gluino masses up to\n1750 and 900 GeV are probed for $c\\tau =$ 1 mm and for the metastable state,\nrespectively. The sensitivity is moderately dependent on model assumptions for\n$c\\tau \\gtrsim 1$ m. The search provides coverage of the $c\\tau$ parameter\nspace for models involving long-lived gluinos that is complementary to existing\ntechniques at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 18:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 20:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

In recent years\nbetatron radiation has been developed as a unique source capable of producing\nhigh resolution x-ray images in compact geometries. However, until now, the\nshort pulse nature of this radiation has not been exploited. This report\ndetails the first experiment to utilise betatron radiation to image a rapidly\nevolving phenomenon by using it to radiograph a laser driven shock wave in a\nsilicon target. The spatial resolution of the image is comparable to what has\nbeen achieved in similar experiments at conventional synchrotron light sources.\nThe intrinsic temporal resolution of betatron radiation is below 100 fs,\nindicating that significantly faster processes could be probed in future\nwithout compromising spatial resolution. Quantitative measurements of the shock\nvelocity and material density were made from the radiographs recorded during\nshock compression and were consistent with the established shock response of\nsilicon, as determined with traditional velocimetry approaches.

First, the multiple access wiretap channel II with a discrete\nmemoryless main channel, under three different wiretapping scenarios, is\nintroduced. The wiretapper, as in the classical wiretap channel II model,\nchooses a fixed-length subset of the channel uses on which she obtains\nnoise-free observations of one of the codewords, a superposition of the two\ncodewords, or each of the two codewords. These thus extend the recently\nexamined wiretap channel II with a noisy main channel to a multiple access\nsetting with a variety of attack models for the wiretapper. Next, a new\nmultiple access wiretap channel model, which further generalizes the multiple\naccess wiretap channel II under the third wiretapping scenario, i.e., that\nwhich features the strongest adversarial model, is proposed. In this model, the\nwiretapper, besides choosing a subset of the channel uses to noiselessly\nobserve the transmitted codeword symbols of both users, observes the remainder\nof the two codewords through a discrete memoryless multiple access channel.\nAchievable strong secrecy rate regions for all the proposed models are derived.\nAchievability is established by solving dual multi-terminal secret key\nagreement problems in the source model, and converting the solution to the\noriginal channel models using probability distribution approximation arguments.\nThe derived achievable rate regions quantify the secrecy cost due to the\nadditional capabilities of the wiretapper with respect to the previous multiple\naccess wiretap models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 18:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

We find the mean grain\nsize of silicate minerals to be a key control on magma ascent. For grain sizes\nlarger than $\\approx$ 1 mm, melt segregation produces distinct radial structure\nand chemical stratification. This stratification is most pronounced for bodies\nformed at around 1 Myr after formation of Ca,Al-rich inclusions. These findings\nsuggest a link between the time and orbital location of planetesimal formation\nand their subsequent structural and chemical evolution. According to our\nmodels, the evolution of partially molten planetesimal interiors falls into two\ncategories. In the magma ocean scenario, the whole interior of a planetesimal\nexperiences nearly complete melting, which would result in turbulent convection\nand core-mantle differentiation by the rainfall mechanism. In the magma sill\nscenario, segregating melts gradually deplete the deep interior of the\nradiogenic heat source. In this case, magma may form melt-rich layers beneath a\ncool and stable lid, while core formation would proceed by percolation. Our\nfindings suggest that grain sizes prevalent during the internal heating stage\ngoverned magma ascent in planetesimals. Regardless of whether evolution\nprogresses toward a magma ocean or magma sill structure, our models predict\nthat temperature inversions due to rapid Al-26 redistribution are limited to\nbodies formed earlier than $\\approx$ 1 Myr after CAIs. We find that if grain\nsize was smaller than $\\approx$ 1 mm during peak internal melting, only\nelevated solid-melt density contrasts (such as found for enstatite chondrite\ncompositions) would allow substantial melt segregation to occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 12:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

The algebraic structure of\nthe $Q$-system is entirely based on (super)symmetry of the model and is\nefficiently described by Wronskian formulas for $Q$-functions organized into\nthe Hasse diagram. When supplemented with analyticity conditions on\n$Q$-functions, it fixes completely the set of physical solutions for spectrum\nof an integrable model.

That is,\ndepending on the state-position and state-transition information, the dynamics\nof the controlled diffusions randomly switches between the different drift and\ndiffusion terms. Here, we specifically investigate the asymptotic exit problem\nconcerning such controlled Markov diffusion processes in two steps: (i) First,\nfor each controlled diffusion model, we look for an admissible Markov control\nprocess that minimizes the principal eigenvalue for the corresponding\ninfinitesimal generator with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions -- where such\nan admissible control process also forces the controlled diffusion process to\nremain in a given bounded open domain for a longer duration. (ii) Then, using\nlarge deviations theory, we determine the exit place and the type of\ndistribution at the exit time for the controlled Markov diffusion processes\ncoupled with random jumps and vanishing diffusion terms. Moreover, the\nasymptotic results at the exit time also allow us to determine the limiting\nbehavior of the Dirichlet problem for the corresponding system of elliptic\npartial differential equations containing a small vanishing parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 20:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

The metal contacts are planar with the bottom surface of the boron\nnitride and form robust contacts to multiple 2D materials.

The\neffectiveness of such selfish mining strategies and their required mining power\nunder such multiple selfish miners setting remains unknown.\n  In this paper, a preliminary investigation and our findings of selfish mining\nstrategy used by multiple miners are reported.

Although a theoretical\nanalysis of selfish mining strategy under this setting is yet to be\nestablished, the current findings based on simulations is promising and of\ngreat interest. In particular, our work shows that a lower bound of power\nthreshold required for selfish mining strategy decreases in proportion to a\nnumber of selfish miners. Moreover, there exist Nash equilibria where all\nselfish miners in the system do not change to an honest mining strategy and\nsimultaneously earn their unfair amount of mining reward given that they\nequally possess sufficiently large mining power.

The pure spin injection\nis capable of inducing oscillations in the absence of charge currents\neffectively reducing the critical tunneling current to zero. This reduction of\nthe critical charge currents can improve the endurance of both STNOs and\nnon-volatile magnetic memories (MRAM) devices. It is shown that the system\nresponse can be described in terms of an injected spin current density $J_s$\nwhich results from the contribution of both spin injection mechanisms, with the\ntunneling current polarization $p$ and the spin Hall angle $\\theta$ acting as\nkey parameters determining the efficiency of each injection mechanism.

The scheme combines quantum\nfield theory on a background space-time, semiclassical treatment of gravitation\nand spontaneous collapse theories. The approach is applied to the context of\nearly universe cosmology using a formal description of the transition from an\ninitial inflationary stage characterized by a spatially homogeneous and\nisotropic (H&I) universe, to another where inhomogeneities are present in\nassociation with quantum fluctuations of the field driving inflation. In that\nwork two constructions are produced. One of them describes a universe that is\ncompletely spatially (H&I), and the other is characterized by a slight\nexcitation of the particular inhomogeneous and anisotropic perturbation.\nFinally, a characterization of their gluing to each other is provided as\nrepresenting the transition as a result from a spontaneous collapse of the\nstate of the quantum field, following the hypothesis originally introduced in\n[2].\n  Specifically, in [1] this construction is carried out by using cosmological\nperturbation theory and working up to linear order in the perturbation.\nHowever, given the nonlinear nature of gravitation, we should in principle\nexplore the application of the formalism in a nonlinear regime. To this end and\nas a first step, we study in this work the transition from a spatially (H&I),\nfrom a SSC-I to one SSC-II that is not spatially (H&I), working this time up to\nsecond order in perturbation theory. We find that the self consistent\nconstruction now requires consideration of the so called tensor modes, as well\nas a nontrivial mixing of modes that made the analysis much more difficult and\nwhich could not a priori be warranted to work out in detail. The present work\nshows that this is indeed the case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 21:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 14:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

In most situations, these processes do not occur in\nisolation, but interact with each other. This renders a comprehensive theory of\nthese processes highly challenging. Here, we propose a theory of\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven at large scale that self-consistently\naccounts for the mutual interplay with magnetic reconnection occurring at\nsmaller scales. Magnetic reconnection produces plasmoids that grow from\nturbulence-generated noise and eventually disrupt the sheet-like structures in\nwhich they are born. The disruption of these structures leads to a modification\nof the turbulent energy cascade, which, in turn, exerts a feedback effect on\nthe plasmoid formation via the turbulence-generated noise. The energy spectrum\nin this plasmoid-mediated range steepens relative to the standard inertial\nrange and does not follow a simple power law. As a result of the complex\ninterplay between turbulence and reconnection, we also find that the length\nscale which marks the beginning of the plasmoid-mediated range and the\ndissipation length scale do not obey true power laws. The transitional magnetic\nReynolds number above which the plasmoid formation becomes statistically\nsignificant enough to affect the turbulent cascade is fairly modest, implying\nthat plasmoids are expected to modify the turbulent path to dissipation in many\nastrophysical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 23:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 17:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

However, finite element\nformulations usually lead to an extremely high number of degrees of freedom of\nthe considered micro-structures, thus making alternative formulations of great\nengineering interest. Among the others, the Boundary Element Method (BEM)\nrepresents a viable alternative to FEM approaches as it allows to express the\nproblem in terms of boundary values only, thus reducing the total number of\ndegrees of freedom.\n  The computational framework developed in this thesis is based on a non-linear\nmulti-domain BEM approach for generally anisotropic materials and is devoted to\nthe analysis of three-dimensional polycrystalline microstructures. Different\ntheoretical and numerical aspects of the polycrystalline problem using the\nboundary element method are investigated: first, being the formulation based on\na integral representation of the governing equations, a novel and more compact\nexpression of the integration kernels capable of representing the multi-field\nbehaviour of generally anisotropic materials is presented; second, the sources\nof the high computational cost of polycrystalline analyses are identified and\nsuitably treated by means of different strategies including an ad-hoc grain\nboundary meshing technique developed to tackle the large statistical\nvariability of polycrystalline micro-morphologies; third, non-linear\ndeformation and failure mechanisms such as inter-granular and trans-granular\ncracking and generally anisotropic crystal plasticity are studied and the\nnumerical results presented throughout the thesis demonstrate the potential of\nthe developed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 23:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

Currently,\nboth average reference (AR) and reference electrode standardization technique\n(REST) are two primary, irreconcilable contenders. We propose a theoretical\nframework to resolve this issue by formulating both a) estimation of potentials\nat infinity, and, b) determination of the reference, as a unified Bayesian\nlinear inverse problem. We find that AR and REST are very particular cases of\nthis unified framework: AR results from biophysically non-informative prior;\nwhile REST utilizes the prior of EEG generative model. We develop the\nregularized versions of AR and REST, named rAR, and rREST, respectively. Both\ndepend on a regularization parameter that is the noise to signal ratio.\nTraditional and new estimators are evaluated with this framework, by both\nsimulations and analysis of real EEGs. Generated artificial EEGs, show that\nrelative error in estimating the EEG potentials at infinity is lowest for\nrREST. It also reveals that realistic volume conductor models improve the\nperformances of REST and rREST. For practical applications, it is shown that\naverage lead field gives the results comparable to the individual lead field.\nFinally, it is shown that the selection of the regularization parameter with\nGeneralized Cross-Validation (GCV) is close to the 'oracle' choice based on the\nground truth. When evaluated with the real 89 resting state EEGs, rREST\nconsistently yields the lowest GCV.

The difficulties mainly arise from the intrinsic\ncomplexity of the MHD equations as well as the indeterminate relation between\nthe PP property and the divergence-free condition on magnetic field. We present\nthe first rigorous PP analysis of conservative schemes with Lax-Friedrichs (LF)\nflux for ideal MHD. The significant innovation is the discovery of theoretical\nconnection between PP property and a discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition.\nThis connection is established through the generalized LF splitting properties,\nwhich are alternatives of the usually-expected LF splitting property that does\nnot hold for ideal MHD. The generalized LF splitting properties involve a\nnumber of admissible states strongly coupled by DDF condition, making their\nderivation very difficult. We derive these properties via a novel equivalent\nform of the admissible state set and an important inequality skillfully\nconstructed by technical estimates. Rigorous PP analysis is presented for\nfinite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes with LF flux on uniform\nCartesian meshes. In 1D case, PP property is proved for the first-order scheme\nwith proper numerical viscosity, and also for arbitrarily high-order schemes\nunder conditions accessible by a PP limiter. In 2D case, we show that the DDF\ncondition is necessary and crucial for achieving PP property. It is observed\nthat even slightly violating the proposed DDF condition may cause failure to\npreserve the positivity of pressure.

Much of transistor\nresearch and applications have relied on transistor models, as well as\nrespective equivalent circuits, to be employed for circuit analysis and\nsimulations. Here, a simple and yet accurate transistor equivalent circuit is\nderived, based on the Early effect, which involves only the voltage $V_a$ and a\ncompanion parameter $s$. Equations are obtained for currents and voltages in a\ncommon-emitter circuit, allowing the derivation of respective gain functions.\nThese functions are found to exhibit interesting mathematical structure, with\ngain values varying almost linearly with the base current, allowing the gains\nto be well characterized in terms of their average and variation values.

The Early equivalent model was used also for studying the stability\nof circuits under voltage supply oscillations, as well as parallel combinations\nof transistors.

In particular, we prove that for any space-time $L^3$ weak\nsolution of the Euler equations, the Lagrangian forward/backward dispersion\nmeasure matches on to the energy defect in the sense of distributions. For\nstrong limits of $d\\geq3$ dimensional Navier-Stokes solutions the defect\ndistribution coincides with the viscous dissipation anomaly. The Lagrangian\nformula shows that particles released into a $3d$ turbulent flow will initially\ndisperse faster backward-in-time than forward, in agreement with recent\ntheoretical predictions of Jucha et. al (2014). In two dimensions, we consider\nstrong limits of solutions of the forced Euler equations with increasingly\nhigh-wavenumber forcing as a model of an ideal inverse cascade regime. We show\nthat the same Lagrangian dispersion measure matches onto the anomalous input\nfrom the infinite-frequency force. As forcing typically acts as an energy\nsource, this leads to the prediction that particles in $2d$ typically disperse\nfaster forward in time than backward, which is opposite to what occurs in $3d$.\nTime-asymmetry of the Lagrangian dispersion is thereby closely tied to the\ndirection of the turbulent cascade, downscale in $d\\geq 3$ and upscale in\n$d=2$.

High value of Tc is\nmainly due to strong coupling to the high-frequency optical modes, although the\nacoustic phonons also make a noticeable contribution. New approach is\ndescribed;it generalizes the standard treatment of the phonon mechanism and\nmakes it possible to obtain an analytical expression for Tc . It turns out\nthat, unlike in the conventional case, the value of the isotope coefficient\nvaries with the pressure and reflects the impact of the optical modes. The\nphase diagram, that is the pressure dependence of Tc, is rather peculiar. A\ncrucial feature is that increasing pressure results in a series of structural\ntransitions, including the one, which yields the superconducting phase with the\nrecord Tc.In a narrow region near 150GPa the critical temperature rises sharply\nfrom 120K to 200K.

We presented a computer-aided annotation method for video tampering\ndataset in this paper. This annotation method can be utilized to label the\nframes of forged video sequences. By means of comparing the original video\nframes with the forged video frames, we can locate the position and the\ntrajectory of the forged areas of the forged video frames. Then, we select\nseveral key points on the temporal domain according to the trajectory of the\nforged areas, and mark the forged area of the forged frames in the key point\nwith a mouse. Finally, we use the linear prediction algorithm based on the\ncoordinates of the key positions in the temporal domain to generate the\nannotation information of forged areas in other video frames which without\nmanually labeled. If the bounding box generated by the computer-aided algorithm\ndeviates from the actual location of the forged area, we can use the mouse to\nchange the position of the bounding box during the preview period. This method\ncombines the manual annotation with computer-aided annotation. It solves the\nproblems of the inaccuracy of annotation by computer-aided as well as the low\nefficiency of annotation manually, and meet the needs of annotation for an\nenormous amount of forged videos in the research of video passive forensics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 05:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

In particular, we consider models with $N$ flavors of\nfermions and $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^N$ symmetry, associated with the conservation of\nthe fermionic parity of each flavor. For a single flavor, we recover the result\nthat a distinct topological phase with exponentially localized zero modes does\nnot exist due to absence of a gap to single particles in the bulk. For $N>1$,\nhowever, we show that the ends of the system can host low-energy,\nexponentially-localized modes. The analysis can readily be generalized to\nsystems in other symmetry classes. To illustrate these ideas, we focus on\nlattice models with $SO\\left(N\\right)$ symmetric interactions, and study the\nphase transition between the trivial and the topological gapless phases using\nbosonization and a weak-coupling renormalization group analysis. As a concrete\nexample, we study in detail the case of $N=3$. We show that in this case, the\ntopologically non-trivial superconducting phase corresponds to a gapless\nanalogue of the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains. In this phase, although the\nbulk is gapless to single particle excitations, the ends host spin-$1/2$\ndegrees of freedom which are exponentially localized and protected by the spin\ngap in the bulk. We obtain the full phase diagram of the model numerically,\nusing density matrix renormalization group calculations. Within this model, we\nidentify the self-dual line studied by Andrei and Destri [Nucl. Phys.

We show\nthat the accompanying $\\gamma$-ray emission from decay of neutral pions, that\nare produced by these same protons, is expected to be on the detectability\nlevel of the present and/or the future satellite and Cherenkov telescopes. The\n$\\gamma$-ray observations of the binary system AR Sco should allow to constrain\nthe efficiency of hadron and electron acceleration and also the details of the\nradiation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 07:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Max-IP is\nvery basic and serves as the base problem in the recent breakthrough of [Abboud\net al., FOCS 2017] on hardness of approximation for polynomial-time problems.\nIt is also used (implicitly) in the argument for hardness of exact\n$\\ell_2$-Furthest Pair (and other important problems in computational geometry)\nin poly-log-log dimensions in [Williams, SODA 2018]. We have three main results\nregarding this problem.\n  First, we study the best multiplicative approximation ratio for Boolean\nMax-IP in sub-quadratic time. We show that, for Max-IP with two sets of $n$\nvectors from $\\{0,1\\}^{d}$, there is an $n^{2 - \\Omega(1)}$ time $\\left( d/\\log\nn \\right)^{\\Omega(1)}$-multiplicative-approximating algorithm, and we show this\nis conditionally optimal, as such a $\\left(d/\\log\nn\\right)^{o(1)}$-approximating algorithm would refute SETH.\n  Second, we achieve a similar characterization for the best additive\napproximation error to Boolean Max-IP.

We show that, under SETH, for Max-IP with sets of $n$ vectors\nfrom $\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ for some $d = 2^{O(\\log^{*} n)}$, every exact algorithm\nrequires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time.

These can be used as building blocks\nin a multi-level data structure, where at each of the levels, one of the basic\ndata structures can be used, with the top level selecting a group of events,\nand the bottom level selecting an element from a group.\n  Depending on assumptions on the distribution of the rates of outcomes,\ndifferent combinations of the basic structures can be used. We prove that for\nparticular data structures the expected time of sampling and update is constant\nwhen the rate distribution follows certain conditions.

However, SR has not been applied to\nenhance the resolution of spatiotemporal event-stream images captured by the\nframe-free dynamic vision sensors (DVSs). SR of event-stream image is\nfundamentally different from existing frame-based schemes since basically each\npixel value of DVS images is an event sequence. In this work, a two-stage\nscheme is proposed to solve the SR problem of the spatiotemporal event-stream\nimage. We use a nonhomogeneous Poisson point process to model the event\nsequence, and sample the events of each pixel by simulating a nonhomogeneous\nPoisson process according to the specified event number and rate function.\nFirstly, the event number of each pixel of the HR DVS image is determined with\na sparse signal representation based method to obtain the HR event-count map\nfrom that of the LR DVS recording. The rate function over time line of the\npoint process of each HR pixel is computed using a spatiotemporal filter on the\ncorresponding LR neighbor pixels. Secondly, the event sequence of each new\npixel is generated with a thinning based event sampling algorithm. Two metrics\nare proposed to assess the event-stream SR results. The proposed method is\ndemonstrated through obtaining HR event-stream images from a series of DVS\nrecordings with the proposed method. Results show that the upscaled HR event\nstreams has perceptually higher spatial texture detail than the LR DVS images.\nBesides, the temporal properties of the upscaled HR event streams match that of\nthe original input very well. This work enables many potential applications of\nevent-based vision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 12:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 10:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

This theory is called Energy-Momentum Squared\nGravity (EMSG) and introduces a new coupling parameter $\\eta$. EMSG resolves\nthe big bang singularity and has a viable sequence of cosmological epochs in\nits thermal history. {Interestingly, in the vacuum EMSG is equivalent to GR,\nand its effects appear only inside the matter-energy distribution. More\nspecifically, its consequences appear in high curvature regime. Therefore it is\nnatural to expect deviations form GR inside compact stars. In order to study\nspherically symmetric compact stars in EMSG, we find the relativistic governing\nequations. More specifically, we find the generalized version of the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation in EMSG. Finally we present two analytical\nsolutions, and two numerical solutions for the field equations. For obtaining\nthe numerical solutions we use polytropic equation of state which is widely\nused to understand the internal structure of neutron stars in the literature.\nEventually we find a mass-radius relation for neutron stars.

In recent years, the method of differential equations has\nproven to be a powerful tool for the computation of Feynman integrals. It has\nbeen observed that the differential equation of Feynman integrals can in many\ninstances be transformed into a so-called canonical form, which significantly\nsimplifies its integration in terms of iterated integrals. The main result of\nthis thesis is an algorithm to compute rational transformations of differential\nequations of Feynman integrals into a canonical form. Apart from requiring the\nexistence of such a rational transformation, the algorithm needs no further\nassumptions about the differential equation. In particular, it is applicable to\nproblems depending on multiple kinematic variables and also allows for a\nrational dependence on the dimensional regulator. First, the transformation law\nis expanded in the dimensional regulator to derive differential equations for\nthe coefficients of the transformation. Using an ansatz in terms of rational\nfunctions, these differential equations are then solved to determine the\ntransformation. This thesis also presents an implementation of the algorithm in\nthe Mathematica package CANONICA, which is the first publicly available program\nto compute transformations to a canonical form for differential equations\ndepending on multiple variables. The main functionality and its usage are\nillustrated with some simple examples. Furthermore, the package is applied to\nstate-of-the-art integral topologies appearing in recent multi-loop\ncalculations. These topologies depend on up to three variables and include\npreviously unknown topologies contributing to higher-order corrections to the\ncross section of single top-quark production at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 13:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

The\ngeometry alignment is performed pixel-wise, i.e., every pixel of the face is\ncorresponded to a pixel of the reference face. In the proposed method, the\ninformation of intensity and geometry of faces are separated properly, trained\nby separate classifiers, and finally fused together to recognize human faces.\nExperimental results show a great improvement using the proposed method in\ncomparison to eye-aligned recognition. For instance, at the false acceptance\nrate of 0.001, the recognition rates are respectively improved by 24% and 33%\nin Yale and AT&T datasets. In LFW dataset, which is a challenging big dataset,\nimprovement is 20% at FAR of 0.1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 14:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

In such a case, it is a puzzle why the hot\nmedium would remain photon starved.

In recent years, several generalizations of MFA have\nbeen developed where the normality assumption of the factors and/or of the\nerrors was relaxed to allow for skewness in the data. However, due to the form\nof the adopted component densities, the distribution of the factors/errors in\nmost of these models is typically limited to modelling skewness oncentrated in\na single direction. Here, we introduce a more flexible finite mixture of factor\nanalyzers based on the class of scale mixtures of canonical fundamental skew\nnormal (SMCFUSN) distributions. This very general class of skew distributions\ncan capture various types of skewness and asymmetry in the data. In particular,\nthe proposed mixture model of SMCFUSN factor analyzers(SMCFUSNFA) can\nsimultaneously accommodate multiple directions of skewness. As such, it\nencapsulates many commonly used models as special and/or limiting cases, such\nas models of some versions of skew normal and skew t-factor analyzers, and skew\nhyperbolic factor analyzers.

Supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieved considerable\nprogress by incorporating semantic side information. However, they mainly have\ntwo limitations: (1) Heavily rely on large-scale labeled cross-modal training\ndata which are labor intensive and hard to obtain. (2) Ignore the rich\ninformation contained in the large amount of unlabeled data across different\nmodalities, especially the margin examples that are easily to be incorrectly\nretrieved, which can help to model the correlations. To address these problems,\nin this paper we propose a novel Semi-supervised Cross-Modal Hashing approach\nby Generative Adversarial Network (SCH-GAN). We aim to take advantage of GAN's\nability for modeling data distributions to promote cross-modal hashing learning\nin an adversarial way. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: (1)\nWe propose a novel generative adversarial network for cross-modal hashing. In\nour proposed SCH-GAN, the generative model tries to select margin examples of\none modality from unlabeled data when giving a query of another modality. While\nthe discriminative model tries to distinguish the selected examples and true\npositive examples of the query. These two models play a minimax game so that\nthe generative model can promote the hashing performance of discriminative\nmodel. (2) We propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm to drive the\ntraining of proposed SCH-GAN. The generative model takes the correlation score\npredicted by discriminative model as a reward, and tries to select the examples\nclose to the margin to promote discriminative model by maximizing the margin\nbetween positive and negative data. Experiments on 3 widely-used datasets\nverify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 15:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

However, most existing deep hashing methods learn a whole set of\nhashing functions independently, while ignore the correlations between\ndifferent hashing functions that can promote the retrieval accuracy greatly.\nInspired by the sequential decision ability of deep reinforcement learning, we\npropose a new Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for Image Hashing (DRLIH).\nOur proposed DRLIH approach models the hashing learning problem as a sequential\ndecision process, which learns each hashing function by correcting the errors\nimposed by previous ones and promotes retrieval accuracy. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to address hashing problem from deep\nreinforcement learning perspective. The main contributions of our proposed\nDRLIH approach can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a deep\nreinforcement learning hashing network.

The second approach is based on that\nthe total precipitation volume for a wet period has the gamma distribution.\nHence, the hypothesis that the total precipitation volume during a certain wet\nperiod is extremely large can be formulated as the homogeneity hypothesis of a\nsample from the gamma distribution. Two equivalent tests are proposed for\ntesting this hypothesis. Both of these tests deal with the relative\ncontribution of the total precipitation volume for a wet period to the\nconsidered set (sample) of successive wet periods. Within the second approach\nit is possible to introduce the notions of relatively and absolutely extreme\nprecipitation volumes. The results of the application of these tests to real\ndata are presented yielding the conclusion that the intensity of wet periods\nwith extreme large precipitation volume increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 15:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 14:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 16:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

The\namplifier converts an input audio signal to a high-frequency train of\nrectangular pulses, whose widths are modulated according to the input signal\n(pulse-width modulation) and employs negative feedback. After determining the\nsteady-state operating point for constant input and calculating its stability,\nwe derive a small-signal model (SSM), which yields in closed form the transfer\nfunction relating (infinitesimal) input and output disturbances. This SSM shows\nhow the RC technique is able to linearise the small-signal response of the\ndevice. We extend this SSM through a fully nonlinear perturbation calculation\nof the dynamics of the amplifier, based on the disparity in time scales between\nthe pulse train and the audio signal. We obtain the nonlinear response of the\namplifier to a general audio signal, avoiding the linearisation inherent in the\nSSM; we thereby more precisely quantify the reduction in distortion achieved\nthrough RC. Finally, simulations corroborate our theoretical predictions and\nillustrate the dramatic deterioration in performance that occurs when the\namplifier is operated in an unstable regime. The perturbation calculation is\nrather general, and may be adapted to quantify the way in which other nonlinear\nnegative-feedback pulse-modulated devices track a time-varying input signal\nthat slowly modulates the system parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 15:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The temporal evolution of the\natom fractions that are either adsorbed or scattered into the continuum is\ninvestigated in detail. We demonstrate that for this description one has to\nconsider trapped, quasi-trapped and scattering states, and present an energetic\ndefinition of these states. The rate equations contain the transition\nprobabilities between the states. We demonstrate how these rate equations can\nbe derived from kinetic theory. Moreover, we present a rigorous way to\ndetermine the transition probabilities from a microscopic analysis of the\nparticle trajectories generated by MD simulations. Once the system reaches\nquasi-equilibrium, the rates converge to stationary values, and the subsequent\nthermal adsorption/desorption dynamics is completely described by the rate\nequations without the need to perform further time-consuming MD simulations.\n  As a proof of concept of our approach, MD simulations for argon atoms\ninteracting with a platinum (111) surface are presented.

The dependence of the rates on the incidence conditions and the\nlattice temperature is analyzed.
