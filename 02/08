One way to establish that the\nparticles are indeed entangled is to verify that they violate a Bell\ninequality. However, it might be the case that Bob is not trustworthy and\nwishes Alice to believe that their communications are secure, when in fact they\nare not. He can do this by managing to have prior knowledge of Alice's\nmeasurement device settings and then modifying his own settings based upon this\ninformation.

However, when the\nmodels are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization, surrogate\nfunctions such as the logistic loss are optimized instead. This is done because\nthe empirical approximations of the expected error and AUC functions are\nnonconvex and nonsmooth, and more importantly have zero derivative almost\neverywhere. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, and\nunder the assumption that the data has normal distribution, the expected error\nand the expected AUC are not only smooth, but have closed form expressions,\nwhich depend on the first and second moments of the normal distribution. Hence,\nwe derive derivatives of these two functions and use these derivatives in an\noptimization algorithm to directly optimize the expected error and the AUC. In\nthe case of real data sets, the derivatives can be approximated using empirical\nmoments. We show that even when data is not normally distributed, computed\nderivatives are sufficiently useful to render an efficient optimization method\nand high quality solutions. Thus, we propose a gradient-based optimization\nmethod for direct optimization of the prediction error and AUC. Moreover, the\nper-iteration complexity of the proposed algorithm has no dependence on the\nsize of the data set, unlike those for optimizing logistic regression and all\nother well known empirical risk minimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 17:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

In the extensively studied classical bulk CDW\nmaterials with quasi-1D crystal structure, the charge carrier transport\nexhibits intriguing sliding behavior, which reveals itself in the frequency\ndomain as \"narrowband\" and \"broadband\" noise. Despite the increasing attention\non physics of 2D CDWs, there have been few reports of CDW sliding, specifically\nin quasi-2D rare-earth tritellurides and none on the noise in any of 2D CDW\nsystems. Here we report the results of low-frequency noise (LFN) measurements\non 1T-TaS2 thin films - archetypal 2D CDW systems, as they are driven from the\nnearly commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) CDW phases by voltage and\ntemperature stimuli. We have found that noise in 1T-TaS2 devices has two\npronounced maxima at the bias voltages, which correspond to the onset of CDW\nsliding and the NC-to-IC phase transition. We observed unusual Lorentzian noise\nfeatures and exceptionally strong noise dependence on electric bias and\ntemperature. We argue that LFN in 2D CDW systems has unique physical origin,\ndifferent from known fundamental noise types. The specifics of LFN in 2D CDW\nmaterials can be explained by invoking the concept of interacting discrete\nfluctuators in the NC-CDW phase. Noise spectroscopy can serve as a useful tool\nfor understanding electronic transport phenomena in 2D CDW materials\ncharacterized by coexistence of different phases and strong CDW pinning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 17:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

Although\nmany optimal solutions may exist to a given matching problem, when the elements\nthat shall or not be included in a solution correspond to individuals, it\nbecomes of paramount importance that the solution be selected fairly. In this\npaper we study individual fairness in matching problems. Given that many\nmaximum matchings may exist, each one satisfying a different set of\nindividuals, the only way to guarantee fairness is through randomization. Hence\nwe introduce the distributional maxmin fairness framework which provides, for\nany given input instance, the strongest guarantee possible simultaneously for\nall individuals in terms of satisfaction probability (the probability of being\nmatched in the solution). Specifically, a probability distribution over\nfeasible solutions is maxmin-fair if it is not possible to improve the\nsatisfaction probability of any individual without decreasing it for some other\nindividual which is no better off.

A critical pressure of $P_1=17$ GPa is associated with: (i) a reduction\nof lattice volume compressibility and a change of behavior of the tetragonal\n$c/a$ ratio take place above $P_1$; (ii) a four-fold symmetry-breaking lattice\nstrain associated with lattice disorder; (iii) disappearance of two Raman\nactive modes (at $\\sim 180$ and $\\sim 260$ cm$^{-1}$); and (iv) development of\nan asymmetric Fano lineshape for the $\\sim 390$ cm$^{-1}$ mode. DFT indicates\nthat the phase above $P_1$ is most likely non-magnetic. Exploring the\nsimilarities between iridate and cuprate physics, we argue that these\nobservations are consistent with the emergence of a rotational\nsymmetry-breaking electronic instability at $P_1$, providing hints for the\navoided metallization under pressure and supporting the hypothesis of possible\ncompeting orders that are detrimental to superconductivity in this family.\nAlternative scenarios for the transition at $P_1$ are also suggested and\ncritically discussed. Additional phonon and lattice anomalies in the tetragonal\nphase are observed at $P_2=30$ and $P_3=40$ GPa, indicating further competing\nphases that are stabilized at high pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 18:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 17:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

This specification determines the performance of the application during\nexecution because the corresponding on-chip hardware resources are allocated\nand managed purely based on this specification. This tight coupling between the\nsoftware-provided resource specification and resource management in hardware\nleads to significant challenges in programming ease, portability, and\nperformance, as we demonstrate in this work.\n  Our goal in this work is to reduce the dependence of performance on the\nsoftware-provided resource specification to simultaneously alleviate the above\nchallenges. To this end, we introduce Zorua, a new resource virtualization\nframework, that decouples the programmer-specified resource usage of a GPU\napplication from the actual allocation in the on-chip hardware resources. Zorua\nenables this decoupling by virtualizing each resource transparently to the\nprogrammer.\n  We demonstrate that by providing the illusion of more resources than\nphysically available, Zorua offers several important benefits: (i) Programming\nEase: Zorua eases the burden on the programmer to provide code that is tuned to\nefficiently utilize the physically available on-chip resources. (ii)\nPortability: Zorua alleviates the necessity of re-tuning an application's\nresource usage when porting the application across GPU generations. (iii)\nPerformance: By dynamically allocating resources and carefully oversubscribing\nthem when necessary, Zorua improves or retains the performance of applications\nthat are already highly tuned to best utilize the resources. The holistic\nvirtualization provided by Zorua has many other potential uses which we\ndescribe in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 20:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

The strong\nmagnetoelastic coupling and the proximity of the structural transition to the\nonset temperature for magnetic fluctuations, suggest that the transition could\nbe an analogue of the tetragonal to orthorhombic observed in Fe-based\npcnictides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 19:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Just like the matrix/vector (MV)\nparadigm, the development of multi-purpose, but high-performance, sparse data\nstructures and algorithms for arithmetic calculations, e.g., those found in\nEinstein-like notation, is crucial for the continued adoption of tensors. We\nuse the example of high-order differential operators to illustrate this need.\nAs sparse tensor arithmetic is an emerging research topic, with challenges\ndistinct from the MV paradigm, many aspects require further articulation. We\nfocus on three core facets. First, aligning with prominent voices in the field,\nwe emphasise the importance of data structures able to accommodate the\noperational complexity of tensor arithmetic. However, we describe a linearised\ncoordinate (LCO) data structure that provides faster and more memory-efficient\nsorting performance. Second, flexible data structures, like the LCO, rely\nheavily on sorts and permutations. We introduce an innovative permutation\nalgorithm, based on radix sort, that is tailored to rearrange already-sorted\nsparse data, producing significant performance gains. Third, we introduce a\nnovel poly-algorithm for sparse tensor products, where hyper-sparsity is a\npossibility. Different manifestations of hyper-sparsity demand their own\napproach, which our poly-algorithm is the first to provide. These developments\nare incorporated within our LibNT and NTToolbox software libraries. Benchmarks,\nfrequently drawn from the high-order differential operators example,\ndemonstrate the practical impact of our routines, with speed-ups of 40% or\nhigher compared to alternative high-performance implementations. Comparisons\nagainst the MATLAB Tensor Toolbox show over 10 times speed improvements. Thus,\nthese advancements produce significant practical improvements for sparse tensor\narithmetic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 20:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

ESQs are\na key building block in developing compact Multiple Electrostatic Quadrupole\nArray Linear Accelerator (MEQALAC) [1].

Using multiple parallel beams, each totaling to\nan area A, can result in higher total beam current compared to a single\naperture beam of the same area. Smaller dimensions also allow for higher\nfocusing electric field gradients and therefore higher average beam current\ndensity.

Over the decades, multiple approaches have been proposed to\nsolve convex programs. The development of interior-point methods allowed\nsolving a more general set of convex programs known as semi-definite programs\nand second-order cone programs. However, it has been established that these\nmethods are excessively slow for high dimensions, i.e., they suffer from the\ncurse of dimensionality. On the other hand, optimization algorithms on manifold\nhave shown great ability in finding solutions to nonconvex problems in\nreasonable time. This paper is interested in solving a subset of convex\noptimization using a different approach. The main idea behind Riemannian\noptimization is to view the constrained optimization problem as an\nunconstrained one over a restricted search space. The paper introduces three\nmanifolds to solve convex programs under particular box constraints. The\nmanifolds, called the doubly stochastic, symmetric and the definite multinomial\nmanifolds, generalize the simplex also known as the multinomial manifold. The\nproposed manifolds and algorithms are well-adapted to solving convex programs\nin which the variable of interest is a multidimensional probability\ndistribution function. Theoretical analysis and simulation results testify the\nefficiency of the proposed method over state of the art methods. In particular,\nthey reveal that the proposed framework outperforms conventional generic and\nspecialized solvers, especially in high dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 20:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

A classical solution is\nto use a linear secret sharing scheme, such as Shamir's scheme, to divide the\ndata into secret shares on which the workers can perform linear computations.\nHowever, classical codes can provide straggler mitigation assuming a worst-case\nscenario of a fixed number of stragglers. We propose a solution based on new\nsecure codes, called Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of the\nauthors. Staircase codes allow flexibility in the number of stragglers up to a\ngiven maximum, and universally achieve the information theoretic limit on the\ndownload cost by the Master, leading to latency reduction. Under the shifted\nexponential model, we find upper and lower bounds on the Master's mean waiting\ntime. We derive the distribution of the Master's waiting time, and its mean,\nfor systems with up to two stragglers. For systems with any number of\nstragglers, we derive an expression that can give the exact distribution, and\nthe mean, of the waiting time of the Master.

Since the shadow is determined by a set of\nspecial photon orbits, rather than horizon properties, it is possible that\ndifferent horizon geometries yield similar shadows. One may then ask how\nsensitive is the shadow to details of the horizon geometry? As a case study, we\nconsider the double Schwarzschild BH and analyse the impact on the lensing and\nshadows of the conical singularity that holds the two BHs in equilibrium --\nherein taken to be a strut along the symmetry axis in between the two BHs.\nWhereas the conical singularity induces a discontinuity of the scattering angle\nof photons, clearly visible in the lensing patterns along the direction of the\nstrut's location, it produces no observable effect on the shadows, whose edges\nremain everywhere smooth. The latter feature is illustrated by examples\nincluding both equal and unequal mass BHs. This smoothness contrasts with the\nintrinsic geometry of the (spatial sections of the) horizon of these BHs, which\nis not smooth, and provides a sharp example on how BH shadows are insensitive\nto some horizon geometry details. This observation, moreover, suggests that for\nthe study of their shadows, this static double BH system may be an informative\nproxy for a dynamical binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 23:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Its structural features, which are widespread in\nbiological neural systems, process olfactory stimuli through a cascade of\nnetworks where large dimension shifts occur from stage to stage and where\nsparsity and randomness play a critical role in coding. Learning is partly\nenabled by a neuromodulatory reward mechanism of octopamine stimulation of the\nAL, whose increased activity induces rewiring of the MB through Hebbian\nplasticity. Enforced sparsity in the MB focuses Hebbian growth on neurons that\nare the most important for the representation of the learned odor. Based upon\ncurrent biophysical knowledge, we have constructed an end-to-end computational\nmodel of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory system which includes the interaction\nof the AL and MB under octopamine stimulation. Our model is able to robustly\nlearn new odors, and our simulations of integrate-and-fire neurons match the\nstatistical features of in-vivo firing rate data. From a biological\nperspective, the model provides a valuable tool for examining the role of\nneuromodulators, like octopamine, in learning, and gives insight into critical\ninteractions between sparsity, Hebbian growth, and stimulation during learning.\nOur simulations also inform predictions about structural details of the\nolfactory system that are not currently well-characterized.

Collections of monomers with binding domains which allow them to form\npolymers via complementary bonds are analyzed to determine their final, stable\nconfigurations, which are those which maximize the number of bonds formed (i.e.\nenthalpy) and the number of independent components (i.e. entropy).

Furthermore, when there is a large\nbacklog of debt, developers often lack the motivation to address it. Objective:\nIn this paper, we describe a design study to investigate how gamification can\nsupport Technical Debt Management in a large legacy software system of an\nindustrial company. Our study leads to a novel tool (named Themis) that\ncombines technical debt support, version control, and gamification features. In\naddition to gamification features, Themis provides suggestions for developers\non where to focus their effort, and visualizations for managers to track\ntechnical debt activities. Method: We describe how Themis was refined and\nvalidated in an iterative deployment with the company, finally conducting a\nqualitative study to investigate how the features of Themis affect technical\ndebt management behavior. We consider the impact on both developers and\nmanagers. Results: Our results show that it achieves increased developer\nmotivation, and supports managers in monitoring and influencing developer\nbehaviors. We show how our findings may be transferable to other contexts by\nproposing guidelines on how to apply gamification. Conclusions: With this case,\ngamification appears as a promising solution to help technical debt management,\nalthough it needs to be carefully designed and implemented to avoid its\npossible negative effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 02:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

When highly sensitive\ndata is involved, an air-gapped computer might also be kept secluded in a\nFaraday cage. The Faraday cage prevents the leakage of electromagnetic signals\nemanating from various computer parts, which may be picked up by an\neavesdropping adversary remotely. The air-gap separation, coupled with the\nFaraday shield, provides a high level of isolation, preventing the potential\nleakage of sensitive data from the system. In this paper, we show how attackers\ncan bypass Faraday cages and air-gaps in order to leak data from highly secure\ncomputers. Our method is based on an exploitation of the magnetic field\ngenerated by the computer CPU. Unlike electromagnetic radiation (EMR), low\nfrequency magnetic radiation propagates though the air, penetrating metal\nshielding such as Faraday cages (e.g., compass still works inside Faraday\ncages).

The key challenge is to optimally encode all the required\nquality levels with efficient usage of storage and networking resources. The\napproach to store and transmit independent copies for every required quality\nlevel is highly wasteful in resources. Alternatively, conventional scalable\ncoding has inherent loss due to its structure. This paper studies a layered\ncoding framework with a relaxed hierarchical structure to transmit information\ncommon to different quality levels along with individual bit streams for each\nquality level. The flexibility of sharing only a properly selected subset of\ninformation from a lower quality level with the higher quality level, enables\nachieving operating points between conventional scalable coding and independent\ncoding, to control the layered coding penalty. Jointly designing common and\nindividual layers' coders overcomes the limitations of conventional scalable\ncoding and non-scalable coding, by providing the flexibility of transmitting\ncommon and individual bit-streams for different quality levels.

It is based on frequency multiplication and synthesis from an\nultralow phase noise 5 MHz Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO) and 100\nMHz Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO).The key component of the\nfrequency multiplication is a non-linear transmission-line (NLTL) used as a\nfrequency comb generator. The phase noise of the synthesizer is improved by\ncarefully optimizing the input power, the input and output impedances of the\nNLTL. The absolute phase noises of the 9.1926 GHz output signal are measured to\nbe -64 dBc/Hz, -83 dBc/Hz, -92 dBc/Hz, -117 dBc/Hz and -119 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz,\n10Hz, 100Hz, 1 kHz and 10 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. The residual\nphase noise of the synthesizer is measured to be -82 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset\nfrequency. The measurement result shows that the absolute phase noise at the\nfrequency range of 1 - 100 Hz is mainly limited by the phase noise of the OCXO.\nThe contribution of the absolute phase noise to the fountain clock short-term\nfrequency stability is calculated to be 7.0x10^(-14). The residual frequency\nstability of the synthesizer is measured to be1.5x10^(-14), which is consistent\nwith the calculated frequency stability due to the residual phase noise of the\nsynthesizer. Meanwhile we designed and realized an interferometric microwave\nswitch in the synthesizer to eliminate the frequency shifts induced by the\nmicrowave leakage. The extinction ratio of the switch is measured to be more\nthan 50 dB. In the scheme, we use only commercially available components to\nbuild the microwave frequency synthesizer with excellent phase noise\nperformance for high-performance Cs fountain clocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 04:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Given a (constant-sized) invertible\nmatrix $M$, a family of polar codes can be associated with this matrix and its\nability to approach capacity follows from the {\\em polarization} of an\nassociated $[0,1]$-bounded martingale, namely its convergence in the limit to\neither $0$ or $1$. Arikan showed polarization of the martingale associated with\nthe matrix $G_2 = \\left(\\begin{matrix} 1& 0 1& 1\\end{matrix}\\right)$ to get\ncapacity achieving codes. His analysis was later extended to all matrices $M$\nthat satisfy an obvious necessary condition for polarization.\n  While Arikan's theorem does not guarantee that the codes achieve capacity at\nsmall blocklengths, it turns out that a \"strong\" analysis of the polarization\nof the underlying martingale would lead to such constructions. Indeed for the\nmartingale associated with $G_2$ such a strong polarization was shown in two\nindependent works ([Guruswami and Xia, IEEE IT '15] and [Hassani et al., IEEE\nIT '14]), resolving a major theoretical challenge of the efficient attainment\nof Shannon capacity.\n  In this work we extend the result above to cover martingales associated with\nall matrices that satisfy the necessary condition for (weak) polarization. In\naddition to being vastly more general, our proofs of strong polarization are\nalso simpler and modular. Specifically, our result shows strong polarization\nover all prime fields and leads to efficient capacity-achieving codes for\narbitrary symmetric memoryless channels. We show how to use our analyses to\nachieve exponentially small error probabilities at lengths inverse polynomial\nin the gap to capacity. Indeed we show that we can essentially match any error\nprobability with lengths that are only inverse polynomial in the gap to\ncapacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 05:02:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 13:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 17:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

To this end, we\nfirst derive closed-form lower bounds on the expected APDD of all LNC\ntechniques under random packet erasures. We then prove that these bounds are\nNP-hard to achieve and, thus, that APDD minimization is an NP-hard problem. We\nthen study the performance of some existing LNC techniques, including random\nlinear network coding (RLNC) and instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). We\nproved that all throughput-optimal LNC techniques can approximate the minimum\nexpected APDD with a ratio between 4/3 and 2. In particular, the ratio of RLNC\nis exactly 2. We then prove that all IDNC techniques are only heuristics in\nterms of throughput optimization and {cannot guarantee an APDD approximation\nratio for at least a subset of the receivers}. Finally, we propose\nhyper-graphic linear network coding (HLNC), a novel throughput-optimal and\nAPDD-approximating LNC technique based on a hypergraph model of receivers'\npacket reception state. We implement it under different availability of\nreceiver feedback, and numerically compare its performance with RLNC and a\nheuristic general IDNC technique. The results show that the APDD performance of\nHLNC is better under all tested system settings, even if receiver feedback is\nonly collected intermittently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 06:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

The dilation matrices of a given processes are\nobtained by a composition of rotations matrices, contain the measure\ninformation in a condensed way. Particularly interesting is the fact that the\nobtention of dilation matrices is regardless of the stationarity of the\nunderlying process. When the process is stationary, it coincides with the\nNaimark Dilation and only one rotation matrix is computed, when the process is\nnon-stationary, a set of rotation matrices are computed. In particular, the\nperiodicity of the correlation function that may appear in some classes of\nsignal is transmitted to the set of dilation matrices. These rotation matrices,\nwhich can be arbitrarily close to each other depending on the sampling or the\nrescaling of the signal are seen as a distinctive feature of the signal. In\norder to study this sequence of matrices, and guided by the possibility to\nrescale the signal, the correct geometrical framework to use with the\ndilation's theoretic results is the space of curves on manifolds, that is the\nset of all curve that lies on a base manifold. To give a complete sight about\nthe space of curve, a metric and the derived geodesic equation are provided.\nThe general results are adapted to the more specific case where the base\nmanifold is the Lie group of rotation matrices.

This paper presents the\nfirst compression technique for scalar data which supports a strictly\ncontrolled loss of topological features. It provides users with specific\nguarantees both on the preservation of the important features and on the size\nof the smaller features destroyed during compression. In particular, we present\na simple compression strategy based on a topologically adaptive quantization of\nthe range.

Recent studies show that low-bit weight representation can\nreduce much storage and memory demand, and also can achieve efficient network\ninference. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach named BWNH to\ntrain Binary Weight Networks via Hashing. In this paper, we first reveal the\nstrong connection between inner-product preserving hashing and binary weight\nnetworks, and show that training binary weight networks can be intrinsically\nregarded as a hashing problem. Based on this perspective, we propose an\nalternating optimization method to learn the hash codes instead of directly\nlearning binary weights.

Next, we determine the local stability of\n$\\mathcal{M}_N$ via the quasi-steady spectrum associated to evolving $N$-pulse\npatterns, which provides provides explicit information on the boundary\n$\\partial\\mathcal{M}_N$.

Combining the asymptotic analysis with numerical\nsimulations of the dynamics on the various invariant manifolds yields a hybrid\nasymptotic-numerical method describing the full process that starts with a\n$N$-pulse pattern and typically ends in the trivial homogeneous state without\npulses. We extensively test this method against PDE simulations and deduce\ngeneral conjectures on the nature of pulse interactions with disappearing\npulses. We especially consider the differences between the evolution of\nirregular and regular patterns. In the former case, the disappearing process is\ngradual: irregular patterns loose their pulses one by one. In contrast,\nregular, spatially periodic, patterns undergo catastrophic transitions in which\neither half or all pulses disappear.

Most analyses have\nbeen based on Lagrangian concepts of transport, focusing on the identification\nof features minimizing fluid exchange among regions, or more recently on\nnetwork tools which focus on connectivity and transport pathways. Neither of\nthese approaches allows ranking the geographical sites of major water passage\nand selecting them so that they monitor waters coming from separate parts of\nthe ocean. These are instead key criteria when deploying an observing network.\nHere we address this issue by estimating at any point the extent of the ocean\nsurface which transits through it in a given time window. With such information\nwe are able to rank the sites with major fluxes that intercept waters\noriginating from different regions. We show that this allows us to optimize an\nobserving network, where a set of sampling sites can be chosen for monitoring\nthe largest flux of water dispersing out of a given region. When the analysis\nis performed backward in time, this method allows us to identify the major\nsources which feed a target region. The method is first applied to a\nminimalistic model of a mesoscale eddy field, and then to realistic\nsatellite-derived ocean currents in the Kerguelen area. In this region we\nidentify the optimal location of fixed stations capable of intercepting the\ntrajectories of 43 surface drifters, along with statistics on the temporal\npersistence of the stations determined in this way. We then identify possible\nhotspots of micro-nutrient enrichment for the recurrent spring phytoplanktonic\nbloom occuring here.

Smartphones, laptops, and e-readers all work with very low (sub-mA)\ncurrents. To perform a switching function in such low-power devices, however, a\nHall sensor must be able to work in the {\\mu}A regime. This paper demonstrates,\nfor the first time, the ability of a standard Hall detector to work in the\n{\\mu}A regime between 0 and 0.7 Tesla. A second important application of this\ntechnology is the measurement of electron transport parameters in thin films,\nwhich is essential to elucidating their electronic behavior. The development of\nnew devices using thin films demands very precise measurements of tiny\nelectrical currents, low-intensity magnetic fields, and other small signals.\nThe proposed system delivers a very small but stable electric current without\nexternal noise, and can be used to measure small transport parameters with very\nhigh precision.

However, determining the right resource partition and task\nparallelism on a per program, per dataset basis is challenging. This is because\nthe number of possible solutions is huge, and the benefit of choosing the right\nsolution may be large, but mistakes can seriously hurt the performance. In this\npaper, we present an automatic approach to determine the hardware resource\npartition and the task granularity for any given application, targeting the\nIntel XeonPhi architecture. Instead of hand-crafting the heuristic for which\nthe process will have to repeat for each hardware generation, we employ machine\nlearning techniques to automatically learn it.

A robust quantum control that prepares,\npreserves, and manipulates nonclassical correlations even in the presence of\nenvironmental influence is of paramount importance in quantum information\nprocessing. A well-known technique to suppress decoherence, namely Dynamical\nDecoupling (DD), consists of a sequence of rapid flips applied to the system in\norder to refocus the system-environment interactions. In this work, we\nintegrate DD with quantum gates using optimal control techniques to realize\nrobust quantum gates which offer protection against decoherence. To investigate\nthe protection of non-classical correlation, we study the evolution of quantum\ndiscord in Grover's search algorithm implemented with dynamically protected\ngates. Using a two-qubit NMR system, we experimentally demonstrate a\nsignificant protection against decoherence and incoherence.

In non-cooperative approaches, positioning is\nonly based on information from reference nodes with known positions (anchors).\nHowever, in cooperative positioning, information from other agents is\nconsidered as well. Cooperative positioning requires encoding of the\nuncertainty of agents' positions. To cope with that demand, we employ\nstochastic inference for localization which inherently considers the position\nuncertainty of agents. However, stochastic inference comes at the expense of\nhigh costs in terms of computation and information exchange. To relax the\nrequirements of inference algorithms, we propose the framework of\nposition-constrained stochastic inference, in which we first confine the\npositions of nodes to feasible sets. We use convex polygons to impose\nconstraints on the possible positions of agents. By doing so, we enable\ninference algorithms to concentrate on important regions of the sample space\nrather than the entire sample space. We show through simulations that increased\nlocalization accuracy, reduced computational complexity, and quicker\nconvergence can be achieved when compared to a state-of-the-art non-constrained\ninference algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 10:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

TAN leverages a fully adversarial training procedure and a\nunique generator/encoder architecture which approximates the transductive\ncombination of the available source- and target-domain data. A benefit of TAN\nis that it allows the distance between the source- and target-domain\nlabel-vector marginal probability distributions to be greater than 0 (i.e.\ndifferent tasks across the source and target domains) whereas other\ndomain-adaptation algorithms require this distance to equal 0 (i.e. a single\ntask across the source and target domains).

CMEs can cause severe disturbances in the interplanetary space\nand even affect human activities in many respects, causing damages to\ninfrastructure and losses of revenue. Fast and accurate prediction of CME\narrival time is then vital to minimize the disruption CMEs may cause when\ninteracting with geospace. In this paper, we propose a new approach for\npartial-/full-halo CME Arrival Time Prediction Using Machine learning\nAlgorithms (CAT-PUMA). Via detailed analysis of the CME features and solar wind\nparameters, we build a prediction engine taking advantage of 182 previously\nobserved geo-effective partial-/full-halo CMEs and using algorithms of the\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM). We demonstrate that CAT-PUMA is accurate and\nfast. In particular, predictions after applying CAT-PUMA to a test set, that is\nunknown to the engine, show a mean absolute prediction error $\\sim$5.9 hours of\nthe CME arrival time, with 54% of the predictions having absolute errors less\nthan 5.9 hours. Comparison with other models reveals that CAT-PUMA has a more\naccurate prediction for 77% of the events investigated; and can be carried out\nvery fast, i.e. within minutes after providing the necessary input parameters\nof a CME. A practical guide containing the CAT-PUMA engine and the source code\nof two examples are available in the Appendix, allowing the community to\nperform their own applications for prediction using CAT-PUMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 10:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Experiments have demonstrated\nthat V-groove quantum wires and pyramidal quantum dots result from\nself-limiting concentration profiles that develop at the bottom of V-grooves\nand inverted pyramids, respectively. In the 1950s, long before the practical\nimportance of patterned substrates became evident, the mechanisms of\ncapillarity during the equilibration of non-planar surfaces were identified and\ncharacterized. This was followed, from the late 1980s by the identification of\ngrowth rate anisotropies (i.e. differential growth rates of crystallographic\nfacets) and precursor decomposition anisotropies, with parallel developments in\nthe fabrication of V-groove quantum wires and pyramidal quantum dots. The\nmodelling of these growth processes began at the scale of facets and culminated\nin systems of coupled reaction-diffusion equations, one for each\ncrystallographic facet that defines the pattern, which takes account of the\ndecomposition and surface diffusion kinetics of the group-III precursors and\nthe subsequent surface diffusion and incorporation of the group-III atoms\nreleased by these precursors.

Its inherent addressless routing paradigm brings\nvaluable characteristics to improve the transmission robustness and efficiency,\ne.g. users are enabled to download content from multiple providers\nconcurrently. However, multipath transmission NDN is different from that in\nMultipath TCP, i.e. the \"paths\" in NDN are transparent to and uncontrollable by\nusers. To this end, the user controls the traffic on all transmission paths as\nan entirety, which leads to a noticeable problem of low bandwidth utilization.\nIn particular, the congestion of a certain path will trigger the traffic\nreduction on the other transmission paths that are underutilized. Some\nsolutions have been proposed by letting routers balance the loads of different\npaths to avoid congesting a certain path prematurely. However, the complexity\nof obtaining an optimal load balancing solution (of solving a Multi-Commodity\nFlow problem) becomes higher with the increasing network size, which limits the\nuniversal NDN deployments.

Specifically, the label switching scheme\nfacilitates users to precisely control the traffic on each transmission path,\nand the addressless routing scheme maintains the valuable feature of retrieving\ncontent from any provider to guarantee robustness. As the traffic on a\ntransmission path can be explicitly controlled by consumers, load balancing is\nno longer needed in routers, which reduce the computational burden of routers\nand consequently increase the system scalability.

Recent ALMA observations showed HCN/HC15N\nratios from 83 to 156 in six T Tauri and Herbig disks and a CN/C15 N ratio of\n323 +/- 30 in one T Tauri star. We aim to determine the dominant mechanism\nresponsible for these enhancements of 15N: low-temperature exchange reactions\nor isotope-selective photodissociation of N2.\n  Methods: Using the thermochemical code DALI, we model the nitrogen isotope\nchemistry in circumstellar disks with a 2D axisymmetric geometry. Our chemical\nnetwork is the first to include both fractionation mechanisms for nitrogen. The\nmodel produces abundance profiles and isotope ratios for several key N-bearing\nspecies. We study how these isotope ratios depend on various disk parameters.\n  Results: The formation of CN and HCN is closely coupled to the vibrational\nexcitation of H2 in the UV-irradiated surface layers of the disk. Isotope\nfractionation is completely dominated by isotope-selective photodissociation of\nN2. The column density ratio of HCN over HC15N in the disk's inner 100 au does\nnot depend strongly on the disk mass, the flaring angle or the stellar\nspectrum, but it is sensitive to the grain size distribution. For larger\ngrains, self-shielding of N2 becomes more important relative to dust\nextinction, leading to stronger isotope fractionation.

At the same time,\nfurther-neighbor interactions become increasingly ferromagnetic upon doping,\nleading to a rapid increase of $T_{\\mathrm{C}}$. Using inelastic neutron\nscattering, we have observed a localized magnetic excitation at about 13 meV,\nassociated with the destruction of the nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn singlet ground\nstate. Hole doping results in a notable broadening of this peak, evidencing\nsignificant particle-hole damping, but with only a minor change in the peak\nposition. We argue that this unexpected result can be explained by a combined\neffect of superexchange and double-exchange interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 13:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

In the\nframework of DUGKS, two kinetic model equations are used to solve the\nquasi-incompressible phase-field governing equations [Yang et al., Phys. Rev.E\n93, 043303 (2016)]. One is for the Chan-Hilliard (CH) equation and the other is\nfor the Navier-Stokes equations. The DUGKS can correctly recover the\nquasi-incompressible phase-field governing equations through the Chapman-Enskog\nanalysis. Unlike previous phase-field-based LB models, the\nCourant-Friedricks-Lewy condition in DUGKS is ajustable which can increase\nnumerical stability. Furthermore, with the finite-volume formulation the model\ncan be easily implemented on non-uniform meshes which can improve numerical\nprecision. The proposed model is validated by simulating a stationary drop,\nlayered Poiseuille flow, rising bubble and Rayleigh-Taylor instability and\ncomparing with the quasi-incompressible lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).\nNumerical results show that the method can track the interface with high\naccuracy and stability. The model is also capable of dealing with a wider range\nof viscosity and density ratios than the quasi-incompressible lattice Boltzmann\nmodel. The present model is a promising tool for numerical simulation of\ntwo-phase flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 14:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

The goal of online learning is to ensure that the\nonline learner would make a sequence of accurate predictions (or correct\ndecisions) given the knowledge of correct answers to previous prediction or\nlearning tasks and possibly additional information. This is in contrast to many\ntraditional batch learning or offline machine learning algorithms that are\noften designed to train a model in batch from a given collection of training\ndata instances. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the\nonline machine learning literatures through a systematic review of basic ideas\nand key principles and a proper categorization of different algorithms and\ntechniques. Generally speaking, according to the learning type and the forms of\nfeedback information, the existing online learning works can be classified into\nthree major categories: (i) supervised online learning where full feedback\ninformation is always available, (ii) online learning with limited feedback,\nand (iii) unsupervised online learning where there is no feedback available.\nDue to space limitation, the survey will be mainly focused on the first\ncategory, but also briefly cover some basics of the other two categories.\nFinally, we also discuss some open issues and attempt to shed light on\npotential future research directions in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 14:18:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 06:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

On the one hand, SQL is\neasy-to-use by non specialists and allows to identify pertinent initial data at\nthe very beginning of the data exploration process. On the other hand, it is\nnot always so easy to formulate SQL queries: nowadays, it is more and more\nfrequent to have several databases available for one application domain, some\nof them with hundreds of tables and/or attributes. Identifying the pertinent\nconditions to select the desired data, or even identifying relevant attributes\nis far from trivial. To make it easier to write SQL queries, we propose the\nnotion of SQL query completion: given a query, it suggests additional\nconditions to be added to its WHERE clause. This completion is semantic, as it\nrelies on the data from the database, unlike current completion tools that are\nmostly syntactic. Since the process can be repeated over and over again --\nuntil the data analyst reaches her data of interest --, SQL query completion\nfacilitates the exploration of databases. SQL query completion has been\nimplemented in a SQL editor on top of a database management system. For the\nevaluation, two questions need to be studied: first, does the completion speed\nup the writing of SQL queries? Second , is the completion easily adopted by\nusers? A thorough experiment has been conducted on a group of 70 computer\nscience students divided in two groups (one with the completion and the other\none without) to answer those questions. The results are positive and very\npromising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 14:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

We show that the Roughness is bounded and therefore it is\na useful tool for comparison between different quantum states for single\nbosonic systems. The state classification via the Roughness is not binary, but\nrather it is continuous in the interval [0,1], being the state more classic as\nthe Roughness approaches to zero, and more quantum when it is closer to the\nunity. The Roughness is maximum for Fock states when its number of photons is\narbitrarily large, and also for squeezed states at the maximum compression\nlimit. On the other hand, the Roughness reaches its minimum value for thermal\nstates at infinite temperature and, more generally, for infinite entropy\nstates. The Roughness of a coherent state is slightly below one half, so we may\nsay that it is more a classical state than a quantum one. Another important\nresult is that the Roughness performs well for discriminating both pure and\nmixed states. Since the Roughness measures the inherent quantumness of a state,\nwe propose another function, the Dynamic Distance Measure (DDM), which is\nsuitable for measure how much quantum is a dynamics. Using DDM, we studied the\nquartic oscillator, and we observed that there is a certain complementarity\nbetween dynamics and state, i.e. when dynamics becomes more quantum, the\nRoughness of the state decreases, while the Roughness grows as the dynamics\nbecomes less quantum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 14:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

These\ntasks are submitted to the server which schedules them to the available\ncomputational resources where the tasks are processed. To tackle the overload\nproblem, we propose a scheduling algorithm which combines traditional\nscheduling approaches with a quality control heuristic which adjusts the\nrequested quality of the solutions and thus changes the processing time of the\ntasks. Two efficient quality control heuristics are introduced: the first\nheuristic sets a global quality for all tasks, whereas the second heuristic\nsets the quality for each task independently. Moreover, in practice, the\nrelationship between the processing time and the quality is not known a priori.\nBecause it is crucial for scheduling algorithms to know at least the estimation\nof these relationships, we propose a general procedure for estimating these\nrelationships using information obtained from the already executed tasks.\nFinally, the performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm is demonstrated\non a real-world problem from the domain of personnel rostering with very good\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 15:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

Super Earths could\npossess a large amount of molecular hydrogen depending on disk, planetary and\nstellar properties. Super Earths orbiting pre-main sequence-M-dwarf stars have\nbeen suggested to possess large amounts of O2 produced abiotically via water\nphotolysis followed by hydrogen escape . If these two constituents were present\nsimultaneously, such large amounts of H2 and O2 can react via photochemistry to\nform up to about 10 Earth oceans. In cases where photochemical removal is slow\nso that O2 can indeed build up abiotically, the atmosphere could reach the\ncombustion explosion limit. Then, H2 and O2 react extremely quickly to form\nwater together with modest amounts of hydrogen peroxide. These processes set\nconstraints for H2 O2 atmospheric compositions in Super Earth atmospheres. Our\ninitial study of the gas-phase oxidation pathways for modest conditions with\nEarth insolation and about a tenth of a percent of H2 suggests that H2 is\noxidized by O2 into H2O mostly via HOx and mixed HOx NOx catalyzed cycles.\nRegarding other atmospheric species-pairs we find that CO,O2 mixtures could\nattain explosive combustive levels on mini gas planets for mid range for the C\nto O ratio in the equilibrium chemistry regime for p more than about 1bar.\nRegarding CH4,O2 mixtures, a small number of modeled rocky planets assuming\nEarth like atmospheres orbiting cooler stars could have compositions at or near\nthe explosive combustive level although more work is required to investigate\nthis issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 15:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Predicting the\nfinal cascade size is critical to ensure the functioning of a system as a\nwhole. Yet, this task is hampered by uncertain or changing parameters and\nmissing information. In infinitely large networks, the average cascade size can\noften be well estimated by established approaches building on local tree\napproximations and mean field approximations. Yet, as we demonstrate, in finite\nnetworks, this average does not even need to be a likely outcome. Instead, we\nfind broad and even bimodal cascade size distributions. This phenomenon\npersists for system sizes up to $10^{7}$ and different cascade models, i.e. it\nis relevant for most real systems. To show this, we derive explicit closed-form\nsolutions for the full probability distribution of the final cascade size. We\nfocus on two topological limit cases, the complete network representing a dense\nnetwork with a very narrow degree distribution, and the star network\nrepresenting a sparse network with a inhomogeneous degree distribution. Those\ntopologies are of great interest, as they either minimize or maximize the\naverage cascade size and are common motifs in many real world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 09:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

The chromaticity of the instrument creates a boundary in\nthe Fourier transform of frequency (proportional to $k_\\parallel$) between\nspectrally smooth emission, characteristic of the strong synchrotron foreground\n(the \"wedge\"), and the spectrally structured emission from HI in the EoR (the\n\"EoR window\"). Faraday rotation can inject spectral structure into otherwise\nsmooth polarized foreground emission, which through instrument effects or\nmiscalibration could possibly pollute the EoR window. Using data from the HERA\n19-element commissioning array, we investigate the polarization response of\nthis new instrument in the power spectrum domain. We perform a simple\nimage-based calibration based on the unpolarized diffuse emission of the Global\nSky Model, and show that it achieves qualitative redundancy between the\nnominally-redundant baselines of the array and reasonable amplitude accuracy.\nWe construct power spectra of all fully polarized coherencies in all\npseudo-Stokes parameters. We compare to simulations based on an unpolarized\ndiffuse sky model and detailed electromagnetic simulations of the dish and\nfeed, confirming that in Stokes I, the calibration does not add significant\nspectral structure beyond the expected level. Further, this calibration is\nstable over the 8 days of observations considered. Excess power is seen in the\npower spectra of the linear polarization Stokes parameters which is not easily\nattributable to leakage via the primary beam, and results from some combination\nof residual calibration errors and actual polarized emission. Stokes V is found\nto be highly discrepant from the expectation of zero power, strongly pointing\nto the need for more accurate polarized calibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 22:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 21:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

One way to address this problem is to\napproximate the original model with fewer input dimensions. Our project goal\nwas to recover a function f that takes n inputs and returns one output, where n\nis potentially large. For any given n-tuple, we assume that we can observe a\nsample of the gradient and output of the function but it is computationally\nexpensive to do so. This project was inspired by an approach known as Active\nSubspaces, which works by linearly projecting to a linear subspace where the\nfunction changes most on average.

In this paper, we propose a\nmechanism to solve this issue of ordering task executions within a CPS which\ninherently handles mutual exclusion. The mechanism caters to a decentralized\nand distributed CPS comprising nodes such as computers, robots and sensor\nnodes, and uses mobile software agents that knit through them to aid the\nexecution of the various tasks while also ensuring mutual exclusion of shared\nresources. The computations, communications and control, are achieved through\nthese mobile agents. Physical execution of the tasks is performed by the robots\nin an asynchronous and pipelined manner without the use of a clock. The\nmechanism also features addition and deletion of tasks and insertion and\nremoval of robots facilitating \\textit{On-The-Fly Programming}.
