The multiple-orbital nature\ngives rise to various novel phenomena like orbital-selective Mott transition,\nnematicity and orbital fluctuation that provide a new route for realizing\nsuperconductivity. The complexity of multiple-orbital also asks to disentangle\nthe relationship between orbital, spin and nematicity, and to identify dominant\norbital ingredients that dictate superconductivity. The bulk FeSe\nsuperconductor provides an ideal platform to address these issues because of\nits simple crystal structure and unique coexistence of superconductivity and\nnematicity. However, the orbital nature of the low energy electronic\nexcitations and its relation to the superconducting gap remain controversial.\nHere we report direct observation of highly anisotropic Fermi surface and\nextremely anisotropic superconducting gap in the nematic state of FeSe\nsuperconductor by high resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission\nmeasurements. We find that the low energy excitations of the entire hole pocket\nat the Brillouin zone center are dominated by the single $d_{xz}$ orbital. The\nsuperconducting gap exhibits an anti-correlation relation with the $d_{xz}$\nspectral weight near the Fermi level, i.e., the gap size minimum (maximum)\ncorresponds to the maximum (minimum) of the $d_{xz}$ spectral weight along the\nFermi surface. These observations provide new insights in understanding the\norbital origin of the extremely anisotropic superconducting gap in FeSe\nsuperconductor and the relation between nematicity and superconductivity in the\niron-based superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 16:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

This further divides into two classes, (1)\nwhere the PDW is a competing state of the d wave superconductor and can exist\nonly near the vortex core where the d wave order is suppressed, and (2) where\nthe PDW is the primary order, the so called mother state that persists with\nstrong phase fluctuations to high temperature and high magnetic field and lies\nbehind the pseudogap phenomenology.

Using model parameters that reproduce the satellite quenched\nfraction in the Local Group, we predict a quenched fraction -- due solely to\nenvironmental effects -- of $\\sim 0.52 \\pm 0.26$ within $1< R/R_{\\rm vir} < 2$\nof the Milky Way and M31. This is in good agreement with current observations\nof the Local Volume and suggests that the majority of the passive field systems\nobserved at these distances are quenched via environmental mechanisms. Beyond\n$2~R_{\\rm vir}$, however, dwarf galaxy quenching becomes difficult to explain\nthrough an interaction with either the Milky Way or M31, such that more\nisolated, field dwarfs may be self-quenched as a result of star-formation\nfeedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 00:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

We investigate the Hausdorff dimension of the set consisting of\n$f-$steep points, from which we can recover the existing results on thick point\nsets for both log-correlated and polynomial-correlated GFFs, and also obtain\nnew results on exceptional sets that, to our best knowledge, have not been\npreviously studied. Our method is inspired by the one used to study the thick\npoint sets of the classical 2D log-correlated GFF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 19:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

The philosophy in these methods is to partition the overall job into\nsmaller tasks that are executed on different servers; this is called the map\nphase. This is followed by a data shuffling phase where appropriate data is\nexchanged between the servers. The final so-called reduce phase, completes the\ncomputation.\n  One potential approach, explored in prior work for reducing the overall\nexecution time is to operate on a natural tradeoff between computation and\ncommunication. Specifically, the idea is to run redundant copies of map tasks\nthat are placed on judiciously chosen servers. The shuffle phase exploits the\nlocation of the nodes and utilizes coded transmission. The main drawback of\nthis approach is that it requires the original job to be split into a number of\nmap tasks that grows exponentially in the system parameters. This is\nproblematic, as we demonstrate that splitting jobs too finely can in fact\nadversely affect the overall execution time.\n  In this work we show that one can simultaneously obtain low communication\nloads while ensuring that jobs do not need to be split too finely.

We also provide an\nexplanation-centered tablestore, a collection of semi-structured tables that\ncontain the knowledge to construct these elementary science explanations.\nTogether, these two knowledge resources map out a substantial portion of the\nknowledge required for answering and explaining elementary science exams, and\nprovide both structured and free-text training data for the explainable\ninference task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 21:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

Moreover, a lowcomplexity NDA-moment-based\nestimator (MBE) is proposed. The proposed NDA-MBE relies on the second- and\nfourth-order moments of the received signal, which are employed to estimate the\nnormalized squared autocorrelation function of the fading channel. Then, the\nproblem of MDS estimation is formulated as a non-linear regression problem, and\nthe least-squares curvefitting optimization technique is applied to determine\nthe estimate of the MDS.

However, holes may appear in the synthesized\nview due to disocclusion, thus significantly degrading the quality.\nConsequently, efforts have been made on developing effective and efficient hole\nfilling algorithms. Current hole filling techniques generally\nextrapolate/interpolate the hole regions with the neighboring information based\non an assumption that the texture pattern in the holes is similar to that of\nthe neighboring background information. However, in many scenarios especially\nof complex texture, the assumption may not hold. In other words, hole filling\ntechniques can only provide an estimation for a hole which may not be good\nenough or may even be erroneous considering a wide variety of complex scene of\nimages. In this paper, we first examine the view interpolation with multiple\nreference views, demonstrating that the problem of emerging holes in a target\nvirtual view can be greatly alleviated by making good use of other neighboring\ncomplementary views in addition to its two (commonly used) most neighboring\nprimary views. The effects of using multiple views for view extrapolation in\nreducing holes are also investigated in this paper. In view of the 3D Video and\nongoing free-viewpoint TV standardization, we propose a new view synthesis\nframework which employs multiple views to synthesize output virtual views.\nFurthermore, a scheme of selective warping of complementary views is developed\nby efficiently locating a small number of useful pixels in the complementary\nviews for hole reduction, to avoid a full warping of additional complementary\nviews thus lowering greatly the warping complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 23:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

Our interest is in an automaton\ndescription (AQS-A) that represents the AQS dynamics in terms of the graph of\nstate transitions triggered by the driving field. A particular feature of these\nsystems is return point memory (RPM), a tendency for the system to return to\nthe same microstate upon cycling the field. It is known that the existence of\nthree conditions, (1) a partial order on the set of configuration; (2) a\nno-passing property; and (3) an adiabatic response to monotonous driving\nfields, implies RPM. When periodically driven, such systems settle into a\ncyclic response after a transient of at most one period. However conditions\n(1)-(3) are only sufficient but not necessary. In fact, we show that the AQS\ndynamics naturally provides a more selective partial order which, due to its\nconnection to hysteresis loops, is a natural choice for establishing RPM. This\nenables us to consider AQS-A exhibiting RPM without necessarily possessing the\nno-passing property. We call such automata $\\ell$AQS-A and work out the\nstructure of their state transition graphs. Our central finding is that RPM\nconstrains the {\\em intra-loop} structure of hysteresis loops, namely its\nhierarchical organization into sub loops, but not the {\\em inter-loop}\nstructure. We prove that the topology of the intra-loop structure has a natural\nrepresentation in terms of an ordered tree and that the corresponding state\ntransition graph is planar. On the other hand, the RPM property does not\nsignificantly restrict inter-loop transitions. A system exhibiting RPM and\nsubject to periodic forcing can thus undergo a large number of transient cycles\nbefore settling into a periodic response. Such systems can even exhibit\nsubharmonic response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 01:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 19:46:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 May 2019 10:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

Methods.We analyze\n8 years of Fermi-LAT data and derive the spectral energy distribution between\n100 MeV and 300 GeV. We extract lightcurves and investigate the variability\nbehaviour for the entire energy range as well as below and above 10 GeV.\nResults.Our analysis provides (i)evidence for HE gamma-ray flux variability and\n(ii)indications for a possible excess over the standard power-law model above\nEb~10 GeV, similar to the earlier indications in the case of Cen A. When viewed\nin HE-VHE context, this is most naturally explained by an additional component\ndominating the highest-energy part of the spectrum. Investigation of the\ngamma-ray lightcurves suggests that the lower-energy (<10 GeV) component is\nvariable on timescales of (at least) a few months. The statistics of the high\nenergy component (>10 GeV) does not allow significant constraints on\nvariability.

Conclusions.The current findings suggest that both the high-energy\n(> Eb) and the very high energy (VHE;>100 GeV) emission in M87 are compatible\nwith originating from the same physical component. The variability behaviour at\nVHE then allows further constraints on the location and the nature of the\nsecond component.

It's broad applicability and interesting combinatorial properties\nhave attracted the attention of many researchers. Of particular interest, is\nthat of bounding the zero forcing number from above. In this paper we show a\nsurprising relation between the zero forcing number of a graph and the\nindependence number of a graph, denoted $\\alpha(G)$.

The regime of greatest uncertainty is\nin the most actively star-forming galaxies, where large dust columns can\npotentially produce a dust-reprocessed infrared radiation field with enough\npressure to drive turbulence or eject material. Here we derive the conditions\nunder which a self-gravitating, mixed gas-star disc can remain hydrostatic\ndespite trapped radiation pressure. Consistently taking into account the\nself-gravity of the medium, the star- and dust-to-gas ratios, and the effects\nof turbulent motions not driven by radiation, we show that galaxies can achieve\na maximum Eddington-limited star formation rate per unit area\n$\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\rm *,crit} \\sim 10^3 M_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$,\ncorresponding to a critical flux of $F_{\\rm *,crit} \\sim 10^{13} L_{\\odot}$\nkpc$^{-2}$ similar to previous estimates; higher fluxes eject mass in bulk,\nhalting further star formation. Conversely, we show that in galaxies below this\nlimit, our one-dimensional models imply simple vertical hydrostatic equilibrium\nand that radiation pressure is ineffective at driving turbulence or ejecting\nmatter. Because the vast majority of star-forming galaxies lie below the\nmaximum limit for typical dust-to-gas ratios, we conclude that infrared\nradiation pressure is likely unimportant for all but the most extreme systems\non galaxy-wide scales. Thus, while radiation pressure does not explain the\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation, it does impose an upper truncation on it. Our\npredicted truncation is in good agreement with the highest observed gas and\nstar formation rate surface densities found both locally and at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 03:53:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 08:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

However, the stability of a layer\ncomposed of such porous silicate dust aggregates has not been investigated.\nTherefore, we investigate the gravitational instability of this dust layer. To\nevaluate the disk stability, we calculate Toomre's stability parameter $Q$, for\nwhich we need to evaluate the equilibrium random velocity of dust aggregates.\nWe calculate the equilibrium random velocity considering gravitational\nscattering and collisions between dust aggregates, drag by mean flow of gas,\nstirring by gas turbulence, and gravitational scattering by gas density\nfluctuation due to turbulence. We derive the condition of the gravitational\ninstability using the disk mass, dust-to-gas ratio, turbulent strength, orbital\nradius, and dust monomer radius.

Classical source models in the short-term Fourier transform domain\nuse circularly-symmetric Gaussian or Poisson random variables. This is\nequivalent to assuming that the phase of each source is uniformly distributed,\nwhich is not suitable for exploiting the underlying structure of the phase.\nDrawing on preliminary works, we introduce here a Bayesian anisotropic Gaussian\nsource model in which the phase is no longer uniform. Such a model permits us\nto favor a phase value that originates from a signal model through a Markov\nchain prior structure. The variance of the latent variables are structured with\nnonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The resulting model is called complex\nItakura-Saito NMF (ISNMF) since it generalizes the ISNMF model to the case of\nnon-isotropic variables. It combines the advantages of ISNMF, which uses a\ndistortion measure adapted to audio and yields a set of estimates which\npreserve the overall energy of the mixture, and of complex NMF, which enables\none to account for some phase constraints.

It is imperative to detect them in a timely manner. Traditionally,\nthis is done through the usage of blacklists, which cannot be exhaustive, and\ncannot detect newly generated malicious URLs. To address this, recent years\nhave witnessed several efforts to perform Malicious URL Detection using Machine\nLearning. The most popular and scalable approaches use lexical properties of\nthe URL string by extracting Bag-of-words like features, followed by applying\nmachine learning models such as SVMs. There are also other features designed by\nexperts to improve the prediction performance of the model. These approaches\nsuffer from several limitations: (i) Inability to effectively capture semantic\nmeaning and sequential patterns in URL strings; (ii) Requiring substantial\nmanual feature engineering; and (iii) Inability to handle unseen features and\ngeneralize to test data. To address these challenges, we propose URLNet, an\nend-to-end deep learning framework to learn a nonlinear URL embedding for\nMalicious URL Detection directly from the URL. Specifically, we apply\nConvolutional Neural Networks to both characters and words of the URL String to\nlearn the URL embedding in a jointly optimized framework. This approach allows\nthe model to capture several types of semantic information, which was not\npossible by the existing models. We also propose advanced word-embeddings to\nsolve the problem of too many rare words observed in this task.

These improvements have\nshown promising results when the test data is similar to the training data.\nHowever, the trained models often fail to produce reliable distances on the\nambiguous test pairs due to the distribution bias between training set and test\nset. To address this problem, the Adversarial Metric Learning (AML) is proposed\nin this paper, which automatically generates adversarial pairs to remedy the\ndistribution bias and facilitate robust metric learning. Specifically, AML\nconsists of two adversarial stages, i.e. confusion and distinguishment. In\nconfusion stage, the ambiguous but critical adversarial data pairs are\nadaptively generated to mislead the learned metric. In distinguishment stage, a\nmetric is exhaustively learned to try its best to distinguish both the\nadversarial pairs and the original training pairs. Thanks to the challenges\nposed by the confusion stage in such competing process, the AML model is able\nto grasp plentiful difficult knowledge that has not been contained by the\noriginal training pairs, so the discriminability of AML can be significantly\nimproved. The entire model is formulated into optimization framework, of which\nthe global convergence is theoretically proved.

Whilst a plethora of Big Data\nCybersecurity Analytic Systems have been reported in the literature, there is a\nlack of a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature from an\narchitectural perspective. Objective: This paper reports a systematic review\naimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and\narchitectural tactics for Big Data Cybersecurity Analytic Systems. Method: We\nused Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for reviewing 74 primary studies\nselected using well-defined criteria.

These methods provide a framework to model\ncomplex, non-linear interactions in large datasets, and are naturally suited to\nthe analysis of hierarchical data such as, for instance, longitudinal data with\nthe use of recurrent neural networks. In the other hand, cohort studies have\nbecome a tool of importance in the research field of epidemiology. In such\nstudies, variables are measured repeatedly over time, to allow the practitioner\nto study their temporal evolution as trajectories, and, as such, as\nlongitudinal data. This paper investigates the application of the advanced\nmodelling techniques provided by the deep learning framework in the analysis of\nthe longitudinal data provided by cohort studies. Methods: A method for\nvisualizing and clustering longitudinal dataset is proposed, and compared to\nother widely used approaches to the problem on both real and simulated\ndatasets. Results: The proposed method is shown to be coherent with the\npreexisting procedures on simple tasks, and to outperform them on more complex\ntasks such as the partitioning of longitudinal datasets into non-spherical\nclusters. Conclusion: Deep artificial neural networks can be used to visualize\nlongitudinal data in a low dimensional manifold that is much simpler to\ninterpret than traditional longitudinal plots are. Consequently, practitioners\nshould start considering the use of deep artificial neural networks for the\nanalysis of their longitudinal data in studies to come.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 11:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

It is well known that\ngravitational sedimentation can affect significantly the abundances of helium\nand heavy elements in the intracluster gas of massive galaxy clusters. The\nself-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature\nrelation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of\nsedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the\nUniverse. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate more complex\nscaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other\nparameters, such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction. An important\nfact is that early-type galaxies can show both decreasing and increasing radial\ntemperature profiles. We have calculated the diffusion based on the observed\ngas density and temperature distributions for 13 early-type galaxies that\nbelonging to the different environments and cover a wide range of X-ray\nluminosities. To estimate the maximum effect of sedimentation and thermal\ndiffusion, we have solved the full set of Burgers' equations for a\nnon-magnetized ISM plasma. The results obtained demonstrate a considerable\nincrease of the He/H ratio within one effective radius for all galaxies of our\nsample. For galaxies with a flat or declining radial temperature profile the\naverage increase of the helium abundance is 60\\% in one billion years of\ndiffusion. The revealed effect can introduce a significant bias in the metal\nabundance measurements based on X-ray spectroscopy and can affect the evolution\nof stars that could be formed from a gas with a high helium abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 12:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

Two variants of the method exist: the short-term divergence\nexponent (DE), and the long-term DE. Only the short-term DE can predict fall\nrisk. The significance of long-term DE has been unclear so far. Some studies\nhave suggested that the complex, fractal-like structure of fluctuations among\nconsecutive strides correlates with long-term DE. The aim, therefore, was to\nassess whether the long-term DE is a gait complexity index. The study\nreanalyzed a dataset of trunk accelerations from 100 healthy adults walking at\npreferred speed on a treadmill for 10 minutes. By interpolation, the stride\nintervals were modified within the acceleration signals for the purpose of\nconserving the original shape of the signal, while imposing a known\nstride-to-stride fluctuation structure. 4 types of hybrid signals with\ndifferent noise structures were built: constant, anti-correlated, random, and\ncorrelated (fractal). Short- and long-term DEs were then computed. The results\nshow that long-term DEs, but not short-term DEs, are sensitive to the noise\nstructure of stride intervals. It was that observed that random hybrid signals\nexhibited significantly lower long-term DEs than hybrid correlated signals did\n(0.100 vs 0.144, i.e. a 44% difference). Long-term DEs from constant hybrid\nsignals were close to zero (0.006). Short-term DEs of anti-correlated, random,\nand correlated hybrid signals were closely grouped (2.49, 2.50, and 2.51). The\nshort- and long-term DEs, although they are both computed from divergence\ncurves, should not be interpreted in a similar way. The long-term DE is very\nlikely an index of gait complexity, which may be associated with gait\nautomaticity or cautiousness. To better differentiate between short- and\nlong-term DEs, the use of the term attractor complexity index (ACI) is proposed\nfor the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 12:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The presence of a defect along the propagation path scatters the\nconventional interface wave and in particular can prohibit a full propagation\nin presence of a localized state at the defect. If the zig-zag path is made\ndisordered, the propagation of the conventional interface mode can be conserved\nat given frequencies for a low random degree and disappears for higher random\ndegree as the interface bands become flat in dispersion and turn to localized\nstates.

In particular,\ndeviations from General Relativity can be observed by comparing incoming\nsignals to waveform templates that include parametrized deviations from General\nRelativity. However, it is essential that the General Relativity sector of\nthese templates accounts for all predictable physics. Otherwise, missing\nphysics might be mimicked by the \"beyond General Relativity\" sector of the\ntemplates, leading the analysis to report apparent deviations from General\nRelativity. Current parametrized tests implement templates that omit physical\nphenomena such as orbital eccentricity and higher-order modes. In this paper,\nwe show how the omission of higher modes can lead to false deviations from\nGeneral Relativity when these effects are strong enough. We study the extent of\nthese deviations as a function of the mass ratio and the orbital orientation.\nWe find that significant false deviations can arise when current tests are\nperformed on signals emitted by asymmetric binaries whose orbital angular\nmomentum is orthogonal to the line-of-sight. We estimate that the Advanced\nLIGO-Virgo network operating at its design sensitivity can observe false\nviolations with a significance above $5 \\sigma$ as often as once per year.\nSimilar results are expected for other tests of General Relativity that use\nmodified waveform models. Hence, we stress the necessity of accurate waveform\nmodels that include physical effects such as higher-order modes to trust future\ntests of General Relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 15:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

The approximation can effectively be learned by\nsimply solving a linear equation system; no backpropagation or similar methods\nare needed. Furthermore, and this is probably the main contribution of this\narticle, the size of an LRNN can be reduced significantly in one step after\ninspecting the spectrum of the network transition matrix, i.e., its\neigenvalues, by taking only the most relevant components. Therefore, in\ncontrast to other approaches, we do not only learn network weights but also the\nnetwork architecture.

Thus, any change in the crack opening entails a loss of energy, until the\ncrack is complete. In particular this implies a fatigue phenomenon, i.e., a\ncomplete fracture may be produced by oscillation of small jumps.\n  The first step of the existence proof is the construction of approximate\nevolutions obtained by solving discrete-time incremental minimum problems. The\nmain difficulty in the passage to the continuous-time limit is that we lack of\ncontrols on the variations of the jump of the approximate evolutions. Therefore\nwe resort to a weak formulation where the variation of the jump is replaced by\na Young measure.

The excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons\nprovides resonance enhancement of TMOKE up to 0.04 and makes it easily\ndetectable in the experiment. For films thicker than 40 nm, the TMOKE\nmarginally depends on the film thickness. A further decrease in the film\nthickness diminishes TMOKE since for such thicknesses the surface\nplasmon-polariton field partly penetrates inside the non-magnetic substrate.\nNevertheless, the TMOKE remains measurable even for few-nm-thick films, which\nmakes this technique unique for the magneto-optical study of ultra-thin films.\nParticularly, the proposed method reveals that the off-diagonal components of\nthe magnetic film permittivity tensor grow slightly with the reduction of the\nfilm thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 09:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

In classical gap acceptance models vehicles on the minor road\naccept any gap greater than the CRITICAL gap, and reject gaps below this\nthreshold, where the gap is the time between two subsequent vehicles on the\nmajor road. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a series of\ngeneralizations of existing models, thus increasing the model's practical\napplicability significantly. First, we incorporate {driver impatience behavior}\nwhile allowing for a realistic merging behavior; we do so by distinguishing\nbetween the critical gap and the merging time, thus allowing MULTIPLE vehicles\nto use a sufficiently large gap. Incorporating this feature is particularly\nchallenging in models with driver impatience. Secondly, we allow for multiple\nclasses of gap acceptance behavior, enabling us to distinguish between\ndifferent driver types and/or different vehicle types. Thirdly, we use the\nnovel M$^X$/SM2/1 queueing model, which has batch arrivals, dependent service\ntimes, and a different service-time distribution for vehicles arriving in an\nempty queue on the minor road (where `service time' refers to the time required\nto find a sufficiently large gap). This setup facilitates the analysis of the\nservice-time distribution of an arbitrary vehicle on the minor road and of the\nqueue length on the minor road. In particular, we can compute the MEAN service\ntime, thus enabling the evaluation of the capacity for the minor road vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 15:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

I agree with my critics that the Hiding Hand exists, i.e.,\nsometimes benefit overruns outweigh cost overruns in project planning and\ndelivery. Specifically, I show this happens in one fifth of projects, based on\nthe best and largest dataset that exists. But that was not the main question I\nset out to answer. My main question was whether the Hiding Hand is \"typical,\"\nas claimed by Hirschman. I show this is not the case, with 80 percent of\nprojects not displaying Hiding Hand behavior. Finally, I agree it would be\nimportant to better understand the circumstances where the Hiding Hand actually\nworks. However, if you want to understand how projects \"typically\" work, as\nHirschman said he did, then the theories of the planning fallacy, optimism\nbias, and strategic misrepresentation - according to which cost overruns and\nbenefit shortfalls are the norm - will serve you significantly better than the\nprinciple of the Hiding Hand. The latter will lead you astray, because it is a\nspecial case instead of a typical one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 20:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Clinical trials for\nsepsis treatment over the last 20 years have failed to produce a single\ncurrently FDA approved drug treatment. In this study, we attempt to discover an\neffective cytokine mediation treatment strategy for sepsis using a previously\ndeveloped agent-based model that simulates the innate immune response to\ninfection: the Innate Immune Response agent-based model (IIRABM). Previous\nattempts at reducing mortality with multi-cytokine mediation using the IIRABM\nhave failed to reduce mortality across all patient parameterizations and\nmotivated us to investigate whether adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine\nmediation can control the trajectory of sepsis and lower patient mortality. We\nused the IIRABM to compute a treatment policy in which systemic patient\nmeasurements are used in a feedback loop to inform future treatment. Using deep\nreinforcement learning, we identified a policy that achieves 0% mortality on\nthe patient parameterization on which it was trained. More importantly, this\npolicy also achieves 0.8% mortality over 500 randomly selected patient\nparameterizations with baseline mortalities ranging from 1 - 99% (with an\naverage of 49%) spanning the entire clinically plausible parameter space of the\nIIRABM. These results suggest that adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine\nmediation therapy could be a promising approach for treating sepsis. We hope\nthat this work motivates researchers to consider such an approach as part of\nfuture clinical trials. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to\nconsider adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation therapy for sepsis,\nand is the first to exploit deep reinforcement learning on a biological\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 19:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}
