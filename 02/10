Multi-wavelength observations are indispensable in studying disk\ngeometry and dust evolution processes in protoplanetary disks. Aims. We aimed\nto construct a 3-dimensional model of HD 163296 capable of reproducing\nsimultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered light with the\nSPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk\nmidplane with ALMA. We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is\nintermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig\nstars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the\nALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used\nto constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and\ngrain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings are observed in the\ndisk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only\nthe innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a\nlack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two\nmodels capable of explaining this difference. The first model uses increased\nsettling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains on the\nsurface of the disk closer to the midplane, and into the shadow cast by the\nfirst ring. The second model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the\nouter disk as a mechanism for decreasing the optical depth at optical and NIR\nwavelengths. In the region outside the fragmentation-dominated regime, such\ndepletion is expected from state-of-the-art dust evolution models. We studied\nthe effect of creating an artificial inner cavity in our models, and conclude\nthat HD 163296 might be a precursor to typical group I sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 16:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Recently, exploiting the millimeter wave (mmW) band for D2D\ncommunications has attracted considerable attention as a potential solution to\nthese challenges. However, its severe sensitivity to blockage along with its\ndirectional nature make the utilization of the mmW band a challenging task as\nit requires line-of-sight (LOS) link detection and careful beam alignment\nbetween the D2D transceivers. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed\nmechanism which enables the D2D devices to discover unblocked LOS links for the\nmmW band communication. Moreover, as such LOS links are not always available,\nthe proposed mechanism allows the D2D devices to switch to the $\\mu$W band if\nnecessary. In addition, the proposed mechanism detects the direction of the LOS\nlinks to perform the beam alignment. We have used tools from stochastic\ngeometry to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability. The\nperformance of the proposed algorithm is then compared to the one of the single\nband (i.e., $\\mu$W/mmW) communication. The simulation results show that the\nproposed mechanism considerably outperforms the single band communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 16:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

The\norientation has implications for the modeling of the binary interaction during\nthe nineteenth century Great Eruption (GE) of Eta Carinae that occurred close\nto periastron passage. The orientation where the secondary is closer to us at\nperiastron leads us to suggest that the mass-missing side of the molecular\nclumps is a result of accretion onto the secondary star during the periastron\npassage when the clumps were ejected, probably during the GE. The secondary\nstar accreted a few solar masses during the GE and the energy from the\naccretion process consists the majority of the GE energy.

Still, real-world\napplications continue to face events that are difficult to classify. The\ninduced imprecision needs to be handled as statistical noise and thus methods\nhave been defined to ensure that measurement errors do not exceed certain\nbounds. Various recommendations for such an APC validation have been made to\nestablish criteria that limit the bias and the variability of the measurement\nerrors. In those works, the misinterpretation of non-significance in\nstatistical hypothesis tests for the detection of differences (e.g. Student's\nt-test) proves to be prevalent, although existing methods which were developed\nunder the term equivalence testing in biostatistics (i.e. bioequivalence\ntrials, Schuirmann in J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 15(6):657-680, 1987) would be\nappropriate instead. This heavily affects the calibration and validation\nprocess of APC systems and has been the reason for unexpected results when the\nsample sizes were not suitably chosen: Large sample sizes were assumed to\nimprove the assessment of systematic measurement errors of the devices from a\nuser's perspective as well as from a manufacturer's perspective, but the\nregular t-test fails to achieve that. We introduce a variant of the t-test, the\nrevised t-test, which addresses both type I and type II errors appropriately\nand allows a comprehensible transition from the long-established t-test in a\nwidely used industrial recommendation. This test is appealing, but still it is\nsusceptible to numerical instability. Finally, we analytically reformulate it\nas a numerically stable equivalence test, which is thus easier to use. Our\nresults therefore allow to induce an equivalence test from a t-test and\nincrease the comparability of both tests, especially for decision makers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 16:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 15:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 23:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 13:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 13:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

Analysis of the dephasing processes suggest that ms $T_2$ can be\nreached at lower temperatures for the excited-state spins, whereas ground-state\nspin states could be limited to a few $\\mu$s due to resonant interactions with\nthe other Er$^{3+}$ spins in the lattice (spin diffusion). We propose a quantum\ntransducer scheme with the potential for close to unit efficiency that exploits\nthe specific advantages offered by the spin states of optically excited\nelectronic energy levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 16:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 16:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Recent studies\nhave revealed that, for a single-layer network, synergy can enhance spreading\nand even induce an explosive contagion. There is at the present a growing\ninterest in behavior spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. What is the role\nof synergistic interactions in behavior spreading in such networked systems? To\naddress this question, we articulate a synergistic behavior spreading model on\na double layer network, where the key manifestation of the synergistic\ninteractions is that the adoption of one behavior by a node in one layer\nenhances its probability of adopting the behavior in the other layer. A general\nresult is that synergistic interactions can greatly enhance the spreading of\nthe behaviors in both layers. A remarkable phenomenon is that the interactions\ncan alter the nature of the phase transition associated with behavior adoption\nor spreading dynamics. In particular, depending on the transmission rate of one\nbehavior in a network layer, synergistic interactions can lead to a\ndiscontinuous (first-order) or a continuous (second-order) transition in the\nadoption scope of the other behavior with respect to its transmission rate. A\nsurprising two-stage spreading process can arise: due to synergy, nodes having\nadopted one behavior in one layer adopt the other behavior in the other layer\nand then prompt the remaining nodes in this layer to quickly adopt the\nbehavior. Analytically, we develop an edge-based compartmental theory and\nperform a bifurcation analysis to fully understand, in the weak synergistic\ninteraction regime where the dynamical correlation between the network layers\nis negligible, the role of the interactions in promoting the social behavioral\nspreading dynamics in the whole system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 18:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

In asymptotic\nterms, this reveals that as long as $L$ scales with the theoretical caching\ngain, then the full cumulative (multiplexing + full caching) gains are achieved\nwith constant subpacketization. This is the first time, in any known setting,\nthat unbounded caching gains appear under finite file-size constraints. The\nachieved caching gains here are up to $L$ times higher than any caching gains\npreviously experienced in any single- or multi-antenna fully-connected setting,\nthus offering a multiplicative mitigation to a subpacketization problem that\nwas previously known to hard-bound caching gains to small constants.\n  The proposed scheme is practical and it works for all values of $K,L$ and all\ncache sizes. The scheme's gains show in practice: e.g. for $K=100$, when $L=1$\nthe theoretical caching gain of $G=10$, under the original coded caching\nalgorithm, would have needed subpacketization $S_1 = \\binom{K}{G}=\n\\binom{100}{10} > 10^{13}$, while if extra transmitting antennas were added,\nthe subpacketization was previously known to match or exceed $S_1$.

The work extends to the multi-server and\ncache-aided IC settings, while the scheme's performance, given subpacketization\n$S_L=\\binom{K/L}{G/L}$, is within a factor of 2 from the optimal linear\nsum-DoF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 18:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

We consider two types of\nsystematics: those related to survey properties and those induced by observer's\nlocation in the Universe. In the former category we model sparse sampling,\nvelocity errors, and survey incompleteness. In the latter, we consider Local\nGroup (LG) analogue observers, placed in a specific location within the Cosmic\nWeb, satisfying various observational criteria. We differentiate such LG\nobservers from Copernican ones, who are at random locations. We report strong\nsystematic effects on the measured BF and CMN induced by sparse sampling,\nvelocity errors and radial incompleteness. For BF most of these effects exceed\n10\\% for scales $R\\leq100h^{-1}$Mpc. For CMN some of these systematics can be\ncatastrophically large ($>50\\%$) also on bigger scales. Moreover, we find that\nthe position of the observer in the Cosmic Web significantly affects the\nlocally measured BF (CMN), with effects as large as $\\sim20\\%$ ($30\\%)$ at\n$R\\leq50h^{-1}$Mpc for a LG-like observer as compared to a random one. This\neffect is comparable to the sample variance. To highlight the importance of\nthese systematics, we additionally study a model of modified gravity (MG) with\n$\\sim15\\%$ enhanced growth rate.

It is often of\nconsiderable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but any\nsingular (\"particle\"-like) source modeling invariably introduces nontrivial\ncomputational obstacles. A common method to circumvent these is through some\nform of delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid;\nhowever, this often carries significant limitations on the efficiency of the\nnumerical convergence rates, or sometimes even the resolvability of the problem\nat all.\n  In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such\nequations which avoids the singular behavior entirely: the\n\"Particle-without-Particle\" method. Previously introduced in the context of the\nself-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to discretize the\ncomputational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral\n(Chebyshev-Lobatto) grids such that the \"particle\" is always at the interface\nbetween them; thus, one only needs to solve homogeneous equations in each\ndomain, with the source effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions\nthereon.

A major hurdle in the search for\nthe sources is the fact that UHECRs are deflected by the Galactic magnetic\nfield (GMF). Current knowledge of the GMF is limited, as most experimental\nmeasurements track line-of-sight--integrated quantities that are used to obtain\nbest-fit parameters for global models including a large random component. The\nadvent, however, of the Gaia era, with measurements of $\\sim 10^9$ stellar\nparallaxes, in combination with upcoming large polarimetric surveys, make, for\nthe first time, a 3D measurement of the GMF possible in principle. Such\nmeasurements can then be used to attempt a reconstruction of the trajectories\nof individual UHECRs through the Galaxy, in order to correct for their\ndeflection.\n  Motivated by these developments, in the present work, we study the limits of\nsuch a correction, by examining how its effectiveness depends on the\nuncertainty of any such future magnetic field measurements. To that end, we\nsimulate attempts to reconstruct the trajectory of the cosmic ray by using\nhypothetical measurements of the GMF, based on values received from two\nrecently updated GMF models. To simulate the uncertainty of a 3D measurement,\nrandom errors to these values are introduced separately for the\nplane-of-the-sky (POS) magnitude, the line-of-sight (LOS) magnitude and the POS\ndirection.\n  Our results highlight the conditions under which an effective correction is\nachievable. We find that the effectiveness is dependent on the particle\nrigidity and arrival direction, and can vary significantly depending on the GMF\nmodel used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 19:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2019 20:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

While\nin the MSSM (or in any theory where supersymmetry is broken by the $F$-vev of a\nchiral spurion), a hierarchy between scalar and gaugino masses requires special\nconstructions, it is automatic in scenarios where supersymmetry is broken by\n$D$-vev of a real spurion. In the latter framework, gaugino mediated\ncontributions to scalar soft masses are finite (loop suppressed but not\n$\\log$-enhanced), a feature often referred to as \"supersoftness\". Though\nphenomenologically attractive, pure supersoft models suffer from the\n$\\mu$-problem, potential color-breaking minima, large $T$-parameter, etc. These\nproblems can be overcome without sacrificing the model's virtues by departing\nfrom pure supersoftness and including $\\mu$-type operators that use the same\n$D$-vev, a framework known as generalized supersoft supersymmetry. The main\npurpose of this paper is to point out that the new operators also solve the\nlast remaining issue associated with supersoft spectra, namely that a right\nhanded (RH) slepton is predicted to be the lightest superpartner, rendering the\nsetup cosmologically unfeasible. In particular, we show that the\n$\\mu$-operators in generalized supersoft generate a new source for scalar\nmasses, which can raise the RH-slepton mass above bino due to corrections from\nrenormalisation group evolutions (RGEs). In fact, a mild tuning can open up the\nbino--RH slepton coannihilation regime for a thermal dark matter. We derive the\nfull set of RGEs required to determine the spectrum at low energies. Beginning\nwith input conditions at a high scale, we show that completely viable spectra\ncan be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 19:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

We demonstrate that the halo's velocity ellipsoid\nevolves strongly with metallicity. At the low [Fe/H] end, the orbital\nanisotropy (the amount of motion in the radial direction compared to the\ntangential one) is mildly radial with 0.2<beta<0.4. However, for stars with\n[Fe/H]>-1.7 we measure extreme values of beta~0.9. Across the metallicity range\nconsidered, i.e. -3<[Fe/H]<-1, the stellar halo's spin is minimal, at the level\nof 20<v_theta (km/s) <30. Using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of\nhalo formation, we deduce that the observed acute anisotropy is inconsistent\nwith the continuous accretion of dwarf satellites.

RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep\nlearning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution\nalong a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the\nmolecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nthis latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction\ncoordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum,\nyet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum\nprobability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for\na new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module\nwith appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing\nuntil estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike\nrecent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands\nout in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction\ncoordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to\nenhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning,\nand (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned\nby the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is\ndemonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity,\nincluding computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic\nligand-substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than\nthree minutes, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for\numbrella sampling or metadynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 19:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

Network data can be understood via the eigenstructure of a graph\nLaplacian matrix using spectral graph theory.

Radiative transfer models predict\nincreased skyglow over cities transitioning to LED unless the total lumen\noutput of new lighting systems is reduced. The City of Tucson, Arizona (U.S.),\nrecently converted its municipal street lighting system from a mixture of fully\nshielded high- and low-pressure sodium (HPS/LPS) luminaires to fully shielded\n3000 K white LED luminaires. The lighting design intended to minimize increases\nto skyglow in order to protect the sites of nearby astronomical observatories\nwithout compromising public safety. This involved the migration of over 445\nmillion fully shielded HPS/LPS lumens to roughly 142 million fully shielded\n3000 K white LED lumens and an expected concomitant reduction in the amount of\nvisual skyglow over Tucson. SkyGlow Simulator models predict skyglow decreases\non the order of 10-20% depending on whether fully shielded or partly shielded\nlights are in use. We tested this prediction using visual night sky brightness\nestimates and luminance-calibrated, panchromatic all-sky imagery at 15\nlocations in and near the city.

This practice does not account for the uncertainty introduced by the\nselection process and the fact that the selected model can possibly be a wrong\none. Model averaging approaches try to remedy this issue by combining\nestimators for a set of candidate models. Specifically, instead of deciding\nwhich model is the 'right' one, a model averaging approach suggests to fit a\nset of candidate models and average over the estimators using certain data\nadaptive weights. In this paper we establish a general frequentist model\naveraging framework that does not set any restrictions on the set of candidate\nmodels. It greatly broadens the scope of the existing methodologies under the\nfrequentist model averaging development. Assuming the data is from an unknown\nmodel, we derive the model averaging estimator and study its limiting\ndistributions and related predictions while taking possible modeling biases\ninto account. We propose a set of optimal weights to combine the individual\nestimators so that the expected mean squared error of the average estimator is\nminimized. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the performance of the\nestimator with that of the existing methods.

While sometimes external information\ncan be used to infer the strength of social ties, access to such information\nmay be restricted or impractical. Sintos and Tsaparas (KDD 2014) first\nsuggested to infer the strength of social ties from the topology of the network\nalone, by leveraging the Strong Triadic Closure (STC) property. The STC\nproperty states that if person A has strong social ties with persons B and C, B\nand C must be connected to each other as well (whether with a weak or strong\ntie). Sintos and Tsaparas exploited this to formulate the inference of the\nstrength of social ties as NP-hard optimization problem, and proposed two\napproximation algorithms. We refine and improve upon this landmark paper, by\ndeveloping a sequence of linear relaxations of this problem that can be solved\nexactly in polynomial time. Usefully, these relaxations infer more fine-grained\nlevels of tie strength (beyond strong and weak), which also allows to avoid\nmaking arbitrary strong/weak strength assignments when the network topology\nprovides inconclusive evidence. One of the relaxations simultaneously infers\nthe presence of a limited number of STC violations. An extensive theoretical\nanalysis leads to two efficient algorithmic approaches. Finally, our\nexperimental results elucidate the strengths of the proposed approach, and\nsheds new light on the validity of the STC property in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2018 08:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 09:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 13:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

In addition to classical (and very\noften static) multi-tier deployment scenarios, cloud-native applications are\ntypically operated on much more complex but elastic infrastructures.\nFurthermore, there is a trend to use elastic container platforms like\nKubernetes, Docker Swarm or Apache Mesos. However, especially multi-cloud use\ncases are astonishingly complex to handle. In consequence, cloud-native\napplications are prone to vendor lock-in. Very often TOSCA-based approaches are\nused to tackle this aspect. But, these application topology defining approaches\nare limited in supporting multi-cloud adaption of a cloud-native application at\nruntime. In this paper, we analyzed several approaches to define cloud-native\napplications being multi-cloud transferable at runtime.

Flying organisms deal with these difficulties\nusing active and passive control mechanisms to steer their body motion. Body\nattitudes of flapping organisms are linked with their resultant flight\ntrajectories and performance, yet little is understood about how discrete\nunsteady aerodynamic phenomena affect the interlaced dynamics of such systems.\nIn this study, we examined freely flying bumblebees subject to a single\ndiscrete gust to emulate aerodynamic disturbances encountered in nature.\nBumblebees are expert commanders of the aerial domain as they persistently\nforage within complex terrain elements. Physical obstacles such as flowers\nproduce local effects representative of a typified gust which threatens the\nprecise control of intricate maneuvers. By tracking the 3D dynamics of bees\nflying through gusts, we determined the sequences of motion that permit flight\nin three disturbance conditions. Bees repetitively executed a series of passive\nimpulsive maneuvers followed by active recovery maneuvers. Impulsive motion was\nunique in each gust direction, maintaining control purely by passive\nmanipulation of the body. Bees pitched up and slowed-down at the beginning of\nrecovery in every disturbance, followed by corrective maneuvers which brought\nattitudes back to their original state. Bees were displaced the most by the\nsideward gust, displaying large lateral translations and roll deviations.\nUpward gusts were easier for bees to fly through, causing only minor flight\nchanges and minimal recovery times. Downward gusts severely impaired the\ncontrol response of bees, inflicting strong adverse forces which sharply upset\ntrajectories. Bees used interesting control strategies when flying in each\ndisturbance, offering new insights into insect-scale flapping flight and\nbio-inspired robotic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2018 12:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

Following Duncan (1983),\nthe wave energy dissipation rate per unit length of breaking crest may be\nrelated to the fifth moment of the wave speed and the non-dimensional breaking\nstrength parameter $b$. We use a finite-volume Navier-Stokes solver with LES\nresolution and volume-of-fluid surface reconstruction (Derakhti and Kirby\n2014a, 2016) to simulate wave packet evolution, breaking onset and\npost-breaking evolution for representative cases of wave packets with breaking\ndue to dispersive focusing and to modulational instability. The present study\nuses these results to investigate the relationship between the breaking\nstrength parameter $b$ and the breaking onset parameter $B$ proposed recently\nby Barthelemy et al. (2018). The latter, formed from the local energy flux\nnormalized by the local energy density and the local crest speed, simplifies,\non the wave surface, to the ratio of fluid speed to crest speed. Following a\nwave crest, when $B$ exceeds a generic threshold value at the wave crest\n(Barthelemy et al., 2018), breaking is imminent. We find a robust relationship\nbetween the breaking strength parameter $b$ and the rate of change of breaking\nonset parameter, $dB/dt$ at the wave crest, as it transitions through the\ngeneric breaking onset threshold ($B\\sim 0.85$), scaled by the local period of\nthe breaking wave.

In this work, we\nargue that this is due to the lack of a good representation for meta-learning,\nand propose deep meta-learning to integrate the representation power of deep\nlearning into meta-learning. The framework is composed of three modules, a\nconcept generator, a meta-learner, and a concept discriminator, which are\nlearned jointly. The concept generator, e.g. a deep residual net, extracts a\nrepresentation for each instance that captures its high-level concept, on which\nthe meta-learner performs few-shot learning, and the concept discriminator\nrecognizes the concepts. By learning to learn in the concept space rather than\nin the complicated instance space, deep meta-learning can substantially improve\nvanilla meta-learning, which is demonstrated on various few-shot image\nrecognition problems.

We investigate here numerically such reactive viscous\nfingering in the case of a reaction decreasing the viscosity to define the\noptimal conditions on the chemical and hydrodynamic parameters for controlling\nfingering. In particular, we analyze the influence of the injection flow rate\nor equivalently of the Peclet number (Pe) of the problem on the efficiency of\nthe chemical control of fingering. We show that the viscosity decreasing\nreaction has an increased stabilizing effect when Pe is decreased. On the\ncontrary, fingering is more intense and the system more unstable when Pe is\nincreased. The related reactive fingering patterns cover then respectively a\nsmaller (larger) area than in the non-reactive equivalent. Depending on the\nvalue of the flow rate, a given chemical reaction may thus either enhance or\nsuppress a fingering instability. This stabilization and destabilization at low\nand high Pe are shown to be related to the Pe-dependent characteristics of a\nminimum in the viscosity profile that develops around the miscible interface\nthanks to the effect of the chemical reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 16:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

The first and second laws of thermodynamics, applied to a harmonic\noscillator or a radiation normal mode, require that the canonical potential\n$\\phi(\\omega/T)$ is a function of a single variable corresponding to the ratio\nof the oscillation frequency to the temperature. The second law of\nthermodynamics involves extremum ideas which may be applied to thermal\nradiation. Our first derivation of the Planck spectrum is based upon the idea\nthat the canonical potential $\\phi(\\omega/T)$ is a monotonic function and all\nits derivatives are monotonic when interpolating between zero-point energy at\nlow temperature and energy equipartition at high temperature; the monotonic\nbehavior precludes the canonical potential from giving a preferred value for\nthe ratio $\\omega/T.$ Our second derivation of the Planck spectrum is based\nupon the requirement that the change in the Helmholtz free energy of the\nradiation in a partitioned box held at constant temperature should be a minimum\nat thermal equilibrium. Finally, the change in Casimir energy with change in\npartition position for the radiation in a partitioned box is shown to\ncorrespond at high temperature to the absence of zero-point energy when the\nspectral energy per normal mode is chosen as the traditional Planck spectrum\nwhich omits zero-point energy at low temperature; thus the idea of zero-point\nenergy is embedded in the traditional Planck spectrum. It is emphasized that\nthermal radiation is intimately connected with zero-point radiation and the\nstructure of spacetime in classical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2018 19:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

This is an ill-posed\nlearning problem since it requires inferring the joint probability distribution\nfrom marginals. Joint learning of coupled mappings $F_{AB}: A \\rightarrow B$\nand $F_{BA}: B \\rightarrow A$ is commonly used by the state-of-the-art methods,\nlike CycleGAN [Zhu et al., 2017], to learn this translation by introducing\ncycle consistency requirement to the learning problem, i.e. $F_{AB}(F_{BA}(B))\n\\approx B$ and $F_{BA}(F_{AB}(A)) \\approx A$. Cycle consistency enforces the\npreservation of the mutual information between input and translated images.\nHowever, it does not explicitly enforce $F_{BA}$ to be an inverse operation to\n$F_{AB}$. We propose a new deep architecture that we call invertible\nautoencoder (InvAuto) to explicitly enforce this relation. This is done by\nforcing an encoder to be an inverted version of the decoder, where\ncorresponding layers perform opposite mappings and share parameters. The\nmappings are constrained to be orthonormal. The resulting architecture leads to\nthe reduction of the number of trainable parameters (up to $2$ times). We\npresent image translation results on benchmark data sets and demonstrate\nstate-of-the art performance of our approach. Finally, we test the proposed\ndomain adaptation method on the task of road video conversion. We demonstrate\nthat the videos converted with InvAuto have high quality and show that the\nNVIDIA neural-network-based end-to-end learning system for autonomous driving,\nknown as PilotNet, trained on real road videos performs well when tested on the\nconverted ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2018 01:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

We tackle this problem using\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). Recently, GANs have been utilized to\ntry to find correspondences between sets of samples.

We present a new GAN\ncalled the Manifold-Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such that\nrelated points in each measurement space are aligned together. We demonstrate\napplications of MAGAN in single-cell biology in integrating two different\nmeasurement types together.
