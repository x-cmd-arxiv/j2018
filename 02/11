While multicellularity\ncan be strongly advantageous, its earliest stages bring unique physical\nchallenges. Nascent multicellular organisms must contend with a novel\nconstraint: intercellular stresses arising from cell-cell interactions that can\nlimit multicellular size. Among the possible evolutionary routes to overcoming\nthis size limit, two appear obvious: multicellular organisms can increase\nintercellular bond strength, allowing them to tolerate larger stresses, or,\nthey can slow the rate of stress accumulation by altering their internal\nstructure. Recent experiments demonstrated that multicellular 'snowflake yeast'\nreadily find a solution to this problem via the latter route. By evolving more\nelongated cells, which decreases cellular packing fraction and thus the rate of\ninternal stress accumulation during growth, snowflake yeast evolve to delay\nfracture and grow larger. However, it is unclear if snowflake yeast evolved\nlarge size along an optimal path, or if the observed path to large size was\ntaken due to proximate biological reasons. Here, we examine the geometric\nefficiency of both strategies using a minimal model that was previously\ndemonstrated to replicate many experimentally observed structural properties of\nsnowflake yeast. We find that changing geometry is a far more efficient route\nto large size than evolving increased intercellular adhesion. In fact,\nincreasing cellular aspect ratio is on average ~13 times more effective at\nincreasing the number of cells in a cluster than increasing bond strength.\nThese results suggest that geometrically-imposed physical constraints may have\nbeen a key early selective force guiding the emergence of multicellular\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2018 16:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

If the stopping\ntime distribution is not known, then to ensure robustness, the distribution is\nchosen by an adversary, to represent the worst-case scenario.\n  A stationary plan for every vertex always chooses the same outgoing edge. For\nfixed horizon or fixed stopping-time distribution, stationary plans are not\nsufficient for optimality. Quite surprisingly we show that when an adversary\nchooses the stopping-time distribution with expected stopping time $T$, then\nstationary plans are sufficient.

A better formulation is needed to help\nquantify the formation mechanism and timescale of regolith evolution. Here, we\npropose an analytically derived stochastic model that describes the evolution\nof regolith generated by small, simple craters.

It allows secondary users (SUs) to use the primary users\n(PUs) channels when they are not being utilized. Cognitive radio involves three\nmain processes: spectrum sensing, deciding, and acting. In the spectrum sensing\nprocess, the channel occupancy is measured with spectrum sensing techniques in\norder to detect unused channels. In the deciding process, sensing results are\nanalyzed and decisions are made based on these results. In the acting process,\nactions are made by adjusting the transmission parameters to enhance the\ncognitive radio performance.\n  One of the main challenges of cognitive radio is the wideband spectrum\nsensing. Existing spectrum sensing techniques are based on a set of\nobservations sampled by an ADC at the Nyquist rate. However, those techniques\ncan sense only one channel at a time because of the hardware limitations on the\nsampling rate. In addition, in order to sense a wideband spectrum, the wideband\nis divided into narrow bands or multiple frequency bands. SUs have to sense\neach band using multiple RF frontends simultaneously, which can result in a\nvery high processing time, hardware cost, and computational complexity. In\norder to overcome this problem, the signal sampling should be as fast as\npossible even with high dimensional signals. Compressive sensing has been\nproposed as a low-cost solution to reduce the processing time and accelerate\nthe scanning process. It allows reducing the number of samples required for\nhigh dimensional signal acquisition while keeping the essential information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Feb 2018 01:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

It is\nbuilt on the premise that an effective treatment plan may have long-term\ndependencies from previous medical history. We approach the problem by using a\nmemory-augmented neural network, in particular, by leveraging the recent\ndifferentiable neural computer that consists of a neural controller and an\nexternal memory module. But differing from the original model, we use dual\ncontrollers, one for encoding the history followed by another for decoding the\ntreatment sequences. In the encoding phase, the memory is updated as new input\nis read; at the end of this phase, the memory holds not only the medical\nhistory but also the information about the current illness. During the decoding\nphase, the memory is write-protected. The decoding controller generates a\ntreatment sequence, one treatment option at a time.

For transition metal arsenide (TMA)-flux-grown crystals, even the\nexistence of SC is open for dispute. Here we re-examine the phase diagram of\nsingle-crystalline Eu(Fe1-xCox)2As2 grown by TMA flux. We found that the\nlattice parameter c shrinks linearly with Co doping, almost twice as fast as\nthat of the tin-flux-grown crystals. With Co doping, the spin-density-wave\n(SDW) order of Fe sublattice is quickly suppressed, being detected only up to x\n= 0.08. The magnetic ordering temperature of the Eu2+ sublattice (TEu) shows a\nsystematic evolution with Co doping, first going down and reaching a minimum at\nx = 0.08, then increasing continuously up to x = 0.24. Over the whole\ncomposition range investigated, no signature of SC is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Feb 2018 11:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

An key element for in-vivo measurements and extrapolations is\nthe dependence of shear stress on body mass. In the case of a Poiseuille\nmodeling of the blood flow, P. Weinberg and C. Ethier have shown that shear\nstress on the aortic endothelium varies like body mass to the power\n$-\\frac{3}{8}$, and is therefore 20-fold higher in mice than in men. However,\nby considering a more physiological oscillating Poiseuille + Womersley\ncombinated flow in the aorta, we show that results differ notably: at larger\nmasses ($M>10 \\ kg$) shear stress varies as body mass to the power\n$-\\frac{1}{8}$ and modifies the man to mouse ratio to 1:8.

In a seminal paper\nby Nielsen, Plotkin and Winskel, they are used to establish a bridge between\nthe theory of domains and the approach to concurrency proposed by Petri. A\nbasic role is played by an unfolding construction that maps (safe) Petri nets\ninto a subclass of event structures, called prime event structures, where each\nevent has a uniquely determined set of causes. Prime event structures, in turn,\ncan be identified with their domain of configurations. At a categorical level,\nthis is nicely formalised by Winskel as a chain of coreflections.\n  Contrary to prime event structures, general event structures allow for the\npresence of disjunctive causes, i.e., events can be enabled by distinct minimal\nsets of events. In this paper, we extend the connection between Petri nets and\nevent structures in order to include disjunctive causes. In particular, we show\nthat, at the level of nets, disjunctive causes are well accounted for by\npersistent places. These are places where tokens, once generated, can be used\nseveral times without being consumed and where multiple tokens are interpreted\ncollectively, i.e., their histories are inessential.

A ubiquitous dynamical phenomenon is the emergence of herding,\nwhere a vast majority of the users concentrate on a small number of resources,\nleading to a low efficiency in resource allocation. To devise strategies to\nprevent herding is thus of high interest. Previous works focused on control\nstrategies that rely on external interventions, such as pinning control where a\nfraction of users are forced to choose a certain action. Is it possible to\neliminate herding without any external control? The main point of this paper is\nto provide an affirmative answer through exploiting artificial intelligence\n(AI). In particular, we demonstrate that, when agents are empowered with\nreinforced learning in that they get familiar with the unknown game environment\ngradually and attempt to deliver the optimal actions to maximize the payoff,\nherding can effectively be eliminated. Computations reveal the striking\nphenomenon that, regardless of the initial state, the system evolves\npersistently and relentlessly toward the optimal state in which all resources\nare used efficiently. However, the evolution process is not without\ninterruptions: there are large fluctuations that occur but only intermittently\nin time. The statistical distribution of the time between two successive\nfluctuating events is found to depend on the parity of the evolution, i.e.,\nwhether the number of time steps in between is odd or even. We develop a\nphysical analysis and derive mean-field equations to gain an understanding of\nthese phenomena. As minority game dynamics and the phenomenon of herding are\ncommon in social, economic, and political systems, and since AI is becoming\nincreasingly widespread, we expect our AI empowered minority game system to\nhave broad applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Feb 2018 15:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

The\nproposals appeal to an apparatus offered by the statistical theory of shape. We\npropose a stress functional basing on a concept of mean shape determined by\nrepresentative particles of a capital carrier. We also propose methods of\ndescribing changes in an amount and a structure of stresses in a capital\nappealing, among others, to a Bookstein's pair of thin plain spline\ndeformation, and a measure of a shape variability. We apply our approach to an\nindirect verification of the hypothesis according to which a capital flow\nbetween economic systems is related to an activity of an inner force related to\nstresses in a capital. We indicate, that the stresses create a phenomenon\nanalogous to the heat, which may be interpreted in terms of a positive economic\nexternal effect, which attracts a capital from environment of a system to the\nsystem. For empirical studies we propose robust approach to estimate the stress\nfunctional basing on the data depth concept.

Furthermore,\nsince our species evolved relatively fast from small groups of hunter-gatherers\nto large and technology-intensive urban agglomerations, it is not a surprise\nthat the major institutions of human society are no longer fit to cope with the\npresent complexity. In this note we draw foundational parallelisms between\nneurophysiological systems and ICT-enabled social systems, discussing how\nframeworks rooted in biology and physics could provide heuristic value in the\ndesign of evolutionary systems relevant to politics and economics. In this\nregard we highlight how the governance of emerging technology (i.e.\nnanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science),\nand the one of climate change both presently confront us with a number of\nconnected challenges. In particular: historically high level of inequality; the\nco-existence of growing multipolar cultural systems in an unprecedentedly\nconnected world; the unlikely reaching of the institutional agreements required\nto deviate abnormal trajectories of development. We argue that wise general\nsolutions to such interrelated issues should embed the deep understanding of\nhow to elicit mutual incentives in the socio-economic subsystems of Earth\nsystem in order to jointly concur to a global utility function (e.g. avoiding\nthe reach of planetary boundaries and widespread social unrest).
