Since this\ncombination sidesteps the oracle problem, it enables the generation of\nGUI-based regression tests. ReTest makes use of evolutionary computing (EC),\nparticularly a genetic algorithm (GA), to optimize these tests towards code\ncoverage. While this is indeed a desirable goal in terms of software testing\nand potentially finds many bugs, it lacks one major ingredient: human behavior.\nConsequently, human testers often find the results less reasonable and\ndifficult to interpret.\n  This thesis proposes a new approach to improve the initial population of the\nGA with the aid of machine learning (ML), forming an ML-technique enhanced-EC\n(MLEC) algorithm. In order to do so, existing tests are exploited to extract\ninformation on how human testers use the given GUI. The obtained data is then\nutilized to train an artificial neural network (ANN), which ranks the available\nGUI actions respectively their underlying GUI components at runtime---reducing\nthe gap between manually created and automatically generated regression tests.\nAlthough the approach is implemented on top of ReTest, it can be easily used to\nguide any form of monkey testing.\n  The results show that with only little training data, the ANN is able to\nreach an accuracy of 82% and the resulting tests represent an improvement\nwithout reducing the overall code coverage and performance significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Feb 2018 16:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

Experiments show that the\nproposed CNN models can perform equally well in both the sRGB space and the\nlinear space. It is also demonstrated that the CNN model can perform joint\ndenoising and demosaicing. The CNN model is very flexible and can be easily\nadopted for demosaicing with any CFA design.

Data\nfrom the HRTS instrument revealed that H2 emission forms in particular regions,\nselectively excited by bright UV transition region and chromospheric lines. We\ntest the conditions under which H2 emission can originate by studying non-LTE\nmodels sampling a broad range of temperature stratifications and radiation\nconditions. Stratification plays the dominant role in determining the\npopulation densities of H2, which forms in greatest abundance near the\ncontinuum photosphere. However, opacity due to photoionization of silicon and\nother neutrals determines the depth to which UV radiation can penetrate to\nexcite the H2. Thus the majority of H2 emission forms in a narrow region, at\nabout 650 km in standard 1D models of the quiet-Sun, near the tau=1 opacity\nsurface for the exciting UV radiation, generally coming from above. When\nirradiated from above using observed intensities of bright UV emission lines,\ndetailed non-LTE calculations show that the spectrum of H2 seen in the\nquiet-Sun SUMER atlas spectrum and HRTS light bridge spectrum can be\nsatisfactorily reproduced in 1D stratified atmospheres, without including 3D or\ntime dependent thermal structures. A detailed comparison to observations from\n1205 to 1550 Angstroms is presented, and the success of this 1D approach to\nmodeling solar UV H2 emission is illustrated by the identification of\npreviously unidentified lines and upper levels in HRTS spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Feb 2018 17:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

All programs synthesized by our tool are\ncapable of producing the specified execution pattern on the supplied\nmicroarchitecture.\n  We used our tool to specify a hardware execution pattern common to\nFlush+Reload attacks and automatically synthesized security litmus tests\nrepresentative of those that have been publicly disclosed for conducting\nMeltdown and Spectre attacks. We also formulated a Prime+Probe threat pattern,\nenabling our tool to synthesize a new variant of each---MeltdownPrime and\nSpectrePrime. Both of these new exploits use Prime+Probe approaches to conduct\nthe timing attack. They are both also novel in that they are 2-core attacks\nwhich leverage the cache line invalidation mechanism in modern cache coherence\nprotocols. These are the first proposed Prime+Probe variants of Meltdown and\nSpectre. But more importantly, both Prime attacks exploit invalidation-based\ncoherence protocols to achieve the same level of precision as a Flush+Reload\nattack. While mitigation techniques in software (e.g., barriers that prevent\nspeculation) will likely be the same for our Prime variants as for original\nSpectre and Meltdown, we believe that hardware protection against them will be\ndistinct.

The\nobjective of the problem is to determine the optimal thrust commands that will\nminimize the time-of-flight while satisfying the aforementioned constraints.\nSolving this problem quickly and reliably is challenging because (a) it is\nnonlinear and non-convex, (b) the validity of the solution is heavily dependent\non the accuracy of the discretization scheme, and (c) it can be difficult to\nselect a suitable reference trajectory to initialize an iterative solution\nprocess. To deal with these issues, our algorithm (a) uses successive\nconvexification to eliminate non-convexities, (b) computes the discrete\nlinear-time-variant system matrices to ensure that the converged solution\nperfectly satisfies the original nonlinear dynamics, and (c) can be initialized\nwith a simple, dynamically inconsistent reference trajectory.

Thus, a\nsynchronization object such as compare-and-swap with an infinite consensus\nnumber and the corresponding instruction can be viewed as \"strong\".

Here, we use a GaAs\ncleaved edge quantum wire to perform momentum-resolved tunneling spectroscopy.\nThis allows us to probe the evolution of the chiral quantum Hall edge states\nand their positions from the sample edge with unprecedented precision from very\nlow magnetic fields all the way to high fields where depopulation occurs. We\npresent consistent analytical and numerical models, inferring the edge states\nfrom the well known bulk spectrum, finding excellent agreement with the\nexperiment -- thus providing direct evidence for the bulk to edge\ncorrespondence. In addition, we observe various features beyond the\nsingle-particle picture, such as Fermi level pinning, exchange-enhanced spin\nsplitting and signatures of edge-state reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 00:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 23:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

When the number of samples is less than this amount, reliable\ndetection of all edges is impossible. In many applications, it is more\nimportant to learn the distribution of the edge (coupling) parameters over the\nnetwork than the specific locations of the edges. Assuming that the entire\ngraph can be partitioned into a number of spatial regions with similar edge\nparameters and reasonably regular boundaries, we develop new\ninformation-theoretic sample complexity bounds and show that a bounded number\nof samples can be sufficient to consistently recover these regions.

The lack of\nability in analyzing ontologies from such a variety of sources, and supporting\nknowledge discovery for clinical practice and biomedical research should be\novercome with new technologies. In this study, we developed a Medical Topic\ndiscovery and Query generation framework (MedTQ), which was composed by a\nseries of approaches and algorithms. A predicate neighborhood pattern-based\napproach introduced has the ability to compute the similarity of predicates\n(relations) in ontologies. Given a predicate similarity metric, machine\nlearning algorithms have been developed for automatic topic discovery and query\ngeneration. The topic discovery algorithm, called the hierarchical K-Means\nalgorithm was designed by extending an existing supervised algorithm (K-means\nclustering) for the construction of a topic hierarchy. In the hierarchical\nK-Means algorithm, a level-by-level optimization strategy was selected for\nconsistent with the strongly association between elements within a topic.\nAutomatic query generation was facilitated for discovered topic that could be\nguided users for interactive query design and processing.

On linearization, it takes a Dirac form similar to that found in\nthe integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 02:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 05:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 04:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

In particular, Li et al.\nshow that increasing the computation load in the Map phase by a factor of $r$\ncan create coded multicasting opportunities to reduce the communication load in\nthe Reduce phase by the same factor. However, there are two major limitations\nin practice. First, it requires an exponentially large number of input files\n(data batches) when the number of computing nodes gets large. Second, it forces\nevery $s$ computing nodes to compute one Map function, which leads to a large\nnumber of Map functions required to achieve the promised gain.

OSR introduces opportunistic\nrouting into traditional source routing based on the parent set of a node's\nupward routing in data collection, significantly addressing the drastic link\ndynamics in low-power and lossy WSNs. We devise a novel adaptive Bloom filter\nmechanism to effectively and efficiently encode a downward source-route in OSR,\nwhich enables a significant reduction of the length of source-route field in\npacket header. OSR is scalable to very large-size WSN/IoT deployments, since\neach resource-constrained node in the network only stores the set of its direct\nchildren. The probabilistic nature of the Bloom filter passively explores\nopportunistic routing. Upon a delivery failure at any hop along the downward\npath, OSR actively performs opportunistic routing to bypass the obsolete/bad\nlink. We demonstrate the desirable scalability of OSR against the standard RPL\ndownward routing. We evaluate the performance of OSR via both simulations and\nreal-world testbed experiments, in comparison with the standard RPL (both\nstoring mode and non-storing mode), ORPL, and the representative dissemination\nprotocol Drip. Our results show that OSR significantly outperforms RPL and ORPL\nin scalability and reliability. OSR also achieves significantly better energy\nefficiency compared to TinyRPL and Drip which are based on the same TinyOS\nplatform as OSR implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 05:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

For clusterings, we calculate the spatially isotropic\ntwo point auto- and cross-correlation functions (2PCFs) for both SMBHs and\ngalaxies by using the mock catalogs generated from Guo 2013 model. We find that\nall 2PCFs have positive dependence on both SMBH and galaxy mass. And there\nexist a significant time evolution in 2PCFs, namely, the clustering effect is\nenhanced at lower redshifts.

These models typically lead to a\ncontinuous or a discontinuous phase transition of the number of adopters as a\nfunction of a control parameter. We explore a simple model of social adoption\nwhere the agents can be in two states, either adopters or non-adopters, and can\nswitch between these two states interacting with other agents through a\nnetwork. The probability of an agent to switch from non-adopter to adopter\ndepends on the number of adopters in her network neighborhood, the adoption\nthreshold $T$ and the adoption coefficient $a$, two parameters defining a Hill\nfunction. In contrast, the transition from adopter to non-adopter is\nspontaneous at a certain rate $\\mu$. In a mean-field approach, we derive the\ngoverning ordinary differential equations and show that the nature of the\ntransition between the global non-adoption and global adoption regimes depends\nmostly on the balance between the probability to adopt with one and two\nadopters. The transition changes from continuous, via a transcritical\nbifurcation, to discontinuous, via a combination of a saddle-node and a\ntranscritical bifurcation, through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. We\ncharacterize the full parameter space.

Instead of a ~100-day plateau as\nobserved for ordinary type II-P supernovae, the light curve of iPTF14hls has at\nleast five distinct peaks, followed by a steep decline at ~1000 days since\ndiscovery. Until 500 days since discovery, the effective temperature of\niPTF14hls is roughly constant at 5000-6000K .

It is found\nthat the light curve of iPTF14hls can be well fit by the usual t^{-5/3}\naccretion law until ~1000 days post discovery when the light curve transitions\nto a steep decline. To account for this steep decline, we suggest a power-law\ndensity profile for the late accreted material, rather than the constant\nprofile as appropriated for the t^{-5/3} accretion law. Detailed modeling\nindicates that the total fallback mass is ~0.2M_{sun}, with an ejecta mass\nM_{ej}~21M_{sun}. We find the third peak of the light curve cannot be well fit\nby the fallback model, indicating that there could be some extra rapid energy\ninjection.

In this\nmanuscript, we investigate a quasi-synchronous VLP system, in which the LED\ntransmitters are synchronous among themselves but are not synchronized with the\nreceiver. In quasi-synchronous VLP systems, position estimation can be\nperformed by utilizing time difference of arrival (TDOA) information together\nwith channel attenuation information, leading to a hybrid localization system.\nTo specify accuracy limits for quasi-synchronous VLP systems, the Cramer-Rao\nlower bound (CRLB) on position estimation is derived in a generic\nthree-dimensional scenario. Then, a direct positioning approach is adopted to\nobtain the maximum likelihood (ML) position estimator based directly on\nreceived signals from LED transmitters.

Effective classification of time-varying EEG signals is still\nchallenging. First, EEG signal processing and feature engineering are\ntime-consuming and highly rely on expert knowledge. In addition, most existing\nstudies focus on domain-specific classification algorithms which may not be\napplicable to other domains. Moreover, the EEG signal usually has a low\nsignal-to-noise ratio and can be easily corrupted. In this regard, we propose a\ngeneric EEG signal classification framework that accommodates a wide range of\napplications to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed framework\ndevelops a reinforced selective attention model to automatically choose the\ndistinctive information among the raw EEG signals. A convolutional mapping\noperation is employed to dynamically transform the selected information to an\nover-complete feature space, wherein implicit spatial dependency of EEG samples\ndistribution is able to be uncovered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework using three representative scenarios: intention recognition\nwith motor imagery EEG, person identification, and neurological diagnosis.\nThree widely used public datasets and a local dataset are used for our\nevaluation. The experiments show that our framework outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines and achieves the accuracy of more than 97% on all\nthe datasets with low latency and good resilience of handling complex EEG\nsignals across various domains.

As a result,these methods cannot distinguish workers personal\npreferences for different correct answers of a partially subjective question\nfrom their ability/expertise to avoid objectively wrong answers for that\nquestion. To address this issue, we present a probabilistic model which (i)\nexplicitly encodes question difficulty as a model parameter and (ii) implicitly\nencodes question subjectivity via latent preference factors for crowd-workers.\nWe show that question subjectivity induces grouping of crowd-workers, revealed\nthrough clustering of their latent preferences. Moreover, we develop a\nquantitative measure of the subjectivity of a question. Experiments show that\nour model(1) improves the performance of both quality control for crowd-sourced\nanswers and next answer prediction for crowd-workers,and (2) can potentially\nprovide coherent rankings of questions in terms of their difficulty and\nsubjectivity, so that task providers can refine their designs of the\ncrowdsourcing tasks, e.g. by removing highly subjective questions or\ninappropriately difficult questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 12:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 04:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-15"}

The active regions previously studied with EIT/SOHO and\nAIA/SDO indicated that long-period intensity pulsations are localized in only\none or two loop bundles. The basic idea of this study is to understand why. For\nthis purpose, we tested the response of different loop systems, using different\nmagnetic configurations, to different stratifications and strengths of the\nheating. We present an extensive parameter-space study using 1D hydrodynamic\nsimulations (1,020 in total) and conclude that the occurrence of TNE requires\nspecific combinations of parameters. Our study shows that the TNE cycles are\nconfined to specific ranges in parameter space. This naturally explains why\nonly some loops undergo constant periodic pulsations over several days: since\nthe loop geometry and the heating properties generally vary from one loop to\nanother in an active region, only the ones in which these parameters are\ncompatible exhibits TNE cycles. Furthermore, these parameters (heating and\ngeometry) are likely to vary significantly over the duration of a cycle, which\npotentially limits the possibilities of periodic behavior. This study also\nconfirms that long-period intensity pulsations and coronal rain are two aspects\nof the same phenomenon: both phenomena can occur for similar heating conditions\nand can appear simultaneously in the simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 12:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

The main approach to performing text categorization is learning\nfrom labeled examples. For many tasks, it may be difficult to find examples in\none language but easy in others. The problem of learning from examples in one\nor more languages and classifying (categorizing) in another is called\ncross-lingual learning. In this work, we present a novel approach that solves\nthe general cross-lingual text categorization problem. Our method generates,\nfor each training document, a set of language-independent features. Using these\nfeatures for training yields a language-independent classifier. At the\nclassification stage, we generate language-independent features for the\nunlabeled document, and apply the classifier on the new representation.\n  To build the feature generator, we utilize a hierarchical\nlanguage-independent ontology, where each concept has a set of support\ndocuments for each language involved. In the preprocessing stage, we use the\nsupport documents to build a set of language-independent feature generators,\none for each language. The collection of these generators is used to map any\ndocument into the language-independent feature space.\n  Our methodology works on the most general cross-lingual text categorization\nproblems, being able to learn from any mix of languages and classify documents\nin any other language. We also present a method for exploiting the hierarchical\nstructure of the ontology to create virtual supporting documents for languages\nthat do not have them. We tested our method, using Wikipedia as our ontology,\non the most commonly used test collections in cross-lingual text\ncategorization, and found that it outperforms existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 13:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

We observe that the bulk\nDirac states in Cd$_3$(As$_{0.66}$P$_{0.34}$)$_2$ are gapped out with an energy\nof 0.23 eV, contrary to the parent Cd$_3$As$_2$ in which the gapless Dirac\nstates have been observed. Thus, our results confirm the earlier predicted\ntopological phase transition in Cd$_3$As$_2$ with perturbation. We further\nnotice that the critical P substitution concentration, at which the two Dirac\npoints that are spread along the $c$-axis in Cd$_3$As$_2$ form a single Dirac\npoint at $\\Gamma$, is much lower [x$_c$(P)$<$ 0.34(3)] than the predicted value\nof x$_c$(P)=0.9. Therefore, our results suggest that the nontrivial band\ntopology of Cd$_3$As$_2$ is remarkably sensitive to the P substitution and can\nonly survive over a narrow substitution range, i.e., 0 $\\leq$ x (P) $<$\n0.34(3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 13:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Our framework\nrelies on projecting all quantum states onto a restricted subset using a fixed\nresource non-increasing operation.

In stiff cases, a well-known spurious\nnumerical phenomenon, i.e. the incorrect propagation speed of discontinuities,\nmay be produced by general fractional step methods due to the under-resolved\ndiscretization in both space and time. The previous random projection method\nhas been successfully applied for stiff detonation capturing in under-resolved\nconditions. Not to randomly project the intermediate state into two presumed\nequilibrium states (completely burnt or unburnt) as in the random projection\nmethod, the present study is to randomly choose the time-dependent advance or\nstop of a reaction process. Each one-way reaction has been decoupled from the\nmulti-reaction kinetics using operator splitting and the local smeared\ntemperature due to numerical dissipation of shock-capturing schemes is compared\nwith a random one within two limited temperatures corresponding to the advance\nand its inverse states, respectively, to control the random reaction. The\nrandom activation or deactivation in the reaction step is thus promising to\ncorrect the deterministic accumulative error of the propagation of\ndiscontinuities. Extensive numerical experiments, including model problems and\nrealistic reacting flows in one and two dimensions, demonstrate this\nexpectation as well as the effectiveness and robustness of the method.\nMeanwhile, for nonstiff problems when spatial and temporal resolutions are\nfine, the proposed random method recovers the results as general fractional\nstep methods, owing to the increasing possibility of activation with\ndiminishing randomness by adding a shift term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 15:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The effects of the various possible RPWM\nstrategies on the Power Spectral Density have been thoroughly studied. Despite\nthe effectiveness of RPWM in spreading harmonic content, an appeal is\nconsistently made to maintain the textbook Pulse Width Modulation scheme 'on\naverage'. Random Switching (RS) does away with this notion and\nprobabilistically operates the switch. In addition to fulfilling several\noptimality conditions, including being the only viable switching strategy at\nthe theoretical limit of performance and having lower switching losses than any\nother RPWM; RS allows for design of the DC behaviour separately from that of\nthe PSD. The pulse amplitude probability affects the DC and total PSD. The\nfirst and second moment of the pulse length probability distribution affects\nthe shape of the envelope of the noise of the PSD. The minimum pulse length\nacts like a selective harmonic filter. The PSD can therefore be shaped without\nexternal filtering by changing these probabilities. Gaussian and Huffman pulse\nlength probabilities are shown to be good choices depending on whether\nreal-time PSD control or spectrum usage are the design goal. In addition, it is\nshown that C\\'uk's state space averaging model applies to RS, with $D \\to p$,\nhence no new tools are needed to understand the low frequency behavior or\ncontrol performance. A benefit of closed loop random switching is that no\nfiltering of the controlled variable is required. Randomly responding in a\nbiased manner dependent on the error is hence shown to be useful.

As phasor analysis cannot be used because of the non-linearity, the\nvoltage at the capacitor was represented in terms of the respective integral,\nimplying a numerical approach. The effect of purely resistive loads was\ninvestigated first, and it was shown that the fanned structure of the\ntransistor isolines can severely distort the amplification, especially for\n$V_a$ small and $s$ large. The total harmonic distortion was found not to\ndepend on $V_a$, being determined by $s$ and the load resistance $R$. An\nexpression was obtained for the current gain in terms of the base current and\nit was shown that it decreases in an almost perfectly linearly fashion with\n$I_B$. Remarkably, no gain variation, and hence perfectly linear amplification,\nis obtained when $R=0$, provided maximum power dissipation limits are not\nexceeded. Capacitive loads imply the detachment of the circuit trajectory from\na straight line to an \"ellipsoidal\"-like loop. This implies a gain asymmetry\nalong upper or lower arcs of this loop. By using the time-dependent circuit\nequations, it was possible to show numerically and by an analytical\napproximation that, at least for the adopted circuit and parameter values, the\nasymmetry induced by capacitive loads is not substantial.
