The\ndecision maker often needs to choose a contextual item at each step from a set\nof candidates. Contextual bandit algorithms have been successfully deployed to\nsuch applications, for the trade-off between exploration and exploitation and\nthe state-of-art performance on minimizing online costs. However, the\napplicability of existing contextual bandit methods is limited by the\nover-simplified assumptions of the problem, such as assuming a simple form of\nthe reward function or assuming a static environment where the states are not\naffected by previous actions. In this work, we put forward Policy Gradients for\nContextual Recommendations (PGCR) to solve the problem without those\nunrealistic assumptions. It optimizes over a restricted class of policies where\nthe marginal probability of choosing an item (in expectation of other items)\nhas a simple closed form, and the gradient of the expected return over the\npolicy in this class is in a succinct form. Moreover, PGCR leverages two useful\nheuristic techniques called Time-Dependent Greed and Actor-Dropout. The former\nensures PGCR to be empirically greedy in the limit, and the latter addresses\nthe trade-off between exploration and exploitation by using the policy network\nwith Dropout as a Bayesian approximation. PGCR can solve the standard\ncontextual bandits as well as its Markov Decision Process generalization.\nTherefore it can be applied to a wide range of realistic settings of\nrecommendations, such as personalized advertising. We evaluate PGCR on toy\ndatasets as well as a real-world dataset of personalized music recommendations.\nExperiments show that PGCR enables fast convergence and low regret, and\noutperforms both classic contextual-bandits and vanilla policy gradient\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 10:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 17:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

In particular, we make the following contributions: (i) We propose\na simple yet effective metric, called Hierarchical Meta-Path Score (HMPS) to\nmeasure the proximity of an unknown user to the other known pool of spammers.\n(ii) We design a feedback-based active learning strategy and show that it\nsignificantly outperforms three state-of-the-art baselines for the task of spam\ndetection. Our method achieves 6.9% and 67.3% higher F1-score and AUC,\nrespectively compared to the best baseline method. (iii) To overcome the\nproblem of less training instances for supervised learning, we show that our\nproposed feedback strategy achieves 25.6% and 46% higher F1-score and AUC\nrespectively than other oversampling strategies. Finally, we perform a case\nstudy to show how our method is capable of detecting those users as spammers\nwho have not been suspended by Twitter (and other baselines) yet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

This bottleneck was\nsubstantially ameliorated by the recent introduction of coded MapReduce\ntechniques which allowed each node --- at the computational cost of having to\npreprocess approximately $t$ times more subtasks --- to reduce its\ncommunication cost by approximately $t$ times. In reality though, the\nassociated speed up gains were severely limited by the requirement that larger\n$t$ and $K$ necessitated that the original task be divided into an extremely\nlarge number of subtasks. In this work we show how node cooperation, along with\na novel assignment of tasks, can help to dramatically ameliorate this\nlimitation.

Our objective is to develop an efficient model reduction method to\nsimultaneously handle high-dimensionality and irregular behaviors of the\nstochastic PDEs under consideration. The advantages of our method lie in three\naspects: (i) online-offline decomposition, i.e., the online cost is independent\nof the size of the triangle mesh; (ii) operator approximation for handling\nnon-affine and high-dimensional random fields; (iii) effective strategy to\ncapture irregular behaviors, e.g., sharp transitions of the PDE solution. Two\nnumerical examples will be provided to demonstrate the advantageous performance\nof our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 17:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

This paper formulates a\nquadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation range and one-bit\nsymbol-level precoding design problem for minimizing the average symbol error\nrate (SER) in downlink massive MIMO transmission. A tight upper-bound for SER\nwith low-resolution DAC precoding is first derived. The derived expression\nsuggests that the performance degradation of one-bit precoding can be\ninterpreted as a decrease in the effective minimum distance of the QAM\nconstellation. Using the obtained SER expression, we propose a QAM\nconstellation range design for the single-user case.

The\ncorresponding minimum distance reduction translates to about 2dB gap between\nthe performance of one-bit precoding and infinite-resolution precoding.

A\nsignificant challenge is the lack of training data, i.e., 2D images of humans\nannotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN\narchitectures. Here, we propose a solution to generate a large set of\nphotorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations. We\nintroduce an image-based synthesis engine that artificially augments a dataset\nof real images with 2D human pose annotations using 3D motion capture data.\nGiven a candidate 3D pose, our algorithm selects for each joint an image whose\n2D pose locally matches the projected 3D pose. The selected images are then\ncombined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image patches in\na kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to train an\nend-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the training data\ninto a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as a $K$-way\nclassification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large training\nsets such as ours. Our method outperforms most of the published works in terms\nof 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows\npromising results for real-world images (LSP). This demonstrates that CNNs\ntrained on artificial images generalize well to real images. Compared to data\ngenerated from more classical rendering engines, our synthetic images do not\nrequire any domain adaptation or fine-tuning stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 17:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

A case in point is the ongoing U.S.\nCongress' investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election\ncampaign, with Russia accused of using trolls (malicious accounts created to\nmanipulate) and bots to spread misinformation and politically biased\ninformation. In this study, we explore the effects of this manipulation\ncampaign, taking a closer look at users who re-shared the posts produced on\nTwitter by the Russian troll accounts publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress\ninvestigation.

Additionally, most retweets\nof troll content originated from two Southern states: Tennessee and Texas.\nUsing state-of-the-art bot detection techniques, we estimated that about 4.9%\nand 6.2% of liberal and conservative users respectively were bots.

These planets are vulnerable to atmospheric\nmass loss due to heating by the parent star's XUV flux. Models coupling\natmospheric mass loss with thermal evolution predicted a bimodal distribution\nof planetary radii, which has gained observational support. However, a key\ncomponent that has been ignored in previous studies is the dissolution of these\ngases into the molten core of rock and iron that constitute most of their mass.\nSuch planets have high temperatures ($>$2000 K) and pressures ($\\sim$kbars) at\nthe core-envelope boundary, ensuring a molten surface and a subsurface\nreservoir of hydrogen that can be 5-10 times larger than the atmosphere. This\nstudy bridges this gap by coupling the thermal evolution of the planet and the\nmass loss of the atmosphere with the thermodynamic equilibrium between the\ndissolved H$_2$ and the atmospheric H$_2$ (Henry's law). Dissolution in the\ninterior allows a planet to build a larger hydrogen repository during the\nplanet formation stage. We show that the dissolved hydrogen outgasses to buffer\natmospheric mass loss. The slow cooling of the planet also leads to outgassing\nbecause solubility decreases with decreasing temperature. Dissolution of\nhydrogen in the interior therefore increases the atmosphere retention ability\nof super-Earths. The study highlights the importance of including the\ntemperature- and pressure-dependent solubility of gases in magma oceans and\ncoupling outgassing to planetary evolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 19:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Over\nthe course of two years, we obtained thirty-nine hours of time-resolved,\noptical photometry of AR Sco at a typical cadence of 5 seconds to study this\npulsation. We find that it undergoes significant changes across the binary\norbital period and that its amplitude, phase, and waveform all vary as a\nfunction of orbital phase. We show that these variations can be explained by\nconstructive and destructive interference between two periodic, double-peaked\nsignals: the spin-orbit beat pulse, and a weaker WD spin pulse. Modelling of\nthe light curve indicates that in the optical, the amplitude of the primary\nspin pulse is 50% of the primary beat amplitude, while the secondary maxima of\nthe beat and spin pulses have similar amplitudes. Finally, we use our timings\nof the beat pulses to confirm the presence of the disputed spin-down of the WD.\nWe measure a beat-frequency derivative of -5.14(32) x 10^-17 Hz/s and show that\nthis is attributable to the spin-down of the WD. This value is approximately\ntwice as large as the estimate from Marsh et al. (2016) but is nevertheless\nconsistent with the constraints established in Potter & Buckley (2018). Our\nprecise measurement of the spin-down rate confirms that the decaying rotational\nenergy of the magnetized white dwarf is sufficient to power the excess\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 19:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 04:11:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 19:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

However efforts to derive inherent characteristics of\nstructural brain networks have been hampered by the very high dimensionality of\nthe data, relatively small sample sizes, and the lack of widely acceptable\nconnectivity-based regions of interests (ROIs). Typical approaches have focused\neither on regions defined by standard anatomical atlases that do not\nincorporate anatomical connectivity, or have been based on voxel-wise analysis,\nwhich results in loss of statistical power relative to structure-wise\nconnectivity analysis. In this work, we propose a novel, computationally\nefficient iterative clustering method to generate connectivity-based\nwhole-brain parcellations that converge to a stable parcellation in a few\niterations. Our algorithm is based on a sparse representation of the whole\nbrain connectivity matrix, which reduces the number of edges from around a half\nbillion to a few million while incorporating the necessary spatial constraints.\nWe show that the resulting regions in a sense capture the inherent connectivity\ninformation present in the data, and are stable with respect to initialization\nand the randomization scheme within the algorithm. These parcellations provide\nconsistent structural regions across the subjects of population samples that\nare homogeneous with respect to anatomic connectivity. Our method also derives\nconnectivity structures that can be used to distinguish between population\nsamples with known different structural connectivity. In particular, new\nresults in structural differences for different population samples such as\nFemales vs Males, Normal Controls vs Schizophrenia, and different age groups in\nNormal Controls are also shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 20:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

This includes the\ndetection of HI up to 10 kpc along the minor axis toward the South and beyond 5\nkpc to the North.

The idea presented\nhere is that approximation approach has to correspond to the physical\nphenomenon described by approximated terms. Pure convection (advection) that is\ndescribed by convective terms is transporting a property along the streamline,\nand the information propagation is unidirectional, i.e., transported property\ndepends on previous values along the streamline but does not depend on the next\nones. The proposed approach represents streamlines on mesh as discrete\nstreamlines and is called Discrete Stream(line) Method (DStreaM). A discrete\nstreamline here is represented as a narrow triangle with one vertex of the\napproximated node and two others neighbor upstream nodes. Discrete streamlines\nare orientated using local flow direction as skew upwind schemes. DStreaM\ncorresponds to pure convection. Here are considered standard test problems:\nadvection of a step profile, advection of a double-step profile, advection of a\nsinusoidal profile, and Smith and Hutton problem. DStreaM solutions were\ncompared with upwind-first order scheme and second-order Total Variation\nDiminishing (TVD) schemes with limiters Min-Mod, QUICK, and SUPERBEE solutions.\nDStreaM demonstrated second-order accuracy and rapid convergence. Upwind and\nDStreaM need 2 or 4 iterations to reach a final solution while TVD schemes need\nfrom 15 to 93.5 more iterations. DStreaM approach looks promising for\ncalculation of convective-dominated problems because it approximates naturally\nfirst derivatives and is straightforwardly applicable as a meshfree method or\non unstructured meshes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 21:17:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 16:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

However, these systems are often vulnerable\nto ambient magnetic distortions and lack useful position information; in the\nabsence of external position aiding (e.g. satellite/ultra-wideband positioning\nsystems) the dead-reckoned position accuracy from a 9-DoF MEMS IMU deteriorates\nrapidly due to unmodelled errors. Positioning information is valuable in many\nsatellite-denied geomatics applications (e.g. indoor navigation, location-based\nservices, etc.). This paper proposes an improved 9-DoF IMU indoor pose tracking\nmethod using batch optimization. By adopting a robust in-situ user\nself-calibration approach to model the systematic errors of the accelerometer,\ngyroscope, and magnetometer simultaneously in a tightly-coupled post-processed\nleast-squares framework, the accuracy of the estimated trajectory from a 9-DoF\nMEMS IMU can be improved. Through a combination of relative magnetic\nmeasurement updates and a robust weight function, the method is able to\ntolerate a high level of magnetic distortions. The proposed auto-calibration\nmethod was tested in-use under various heterogeneous magnetic field conditions\nto mimic a person walking with the sensor in their pocket, a person checking\ntheir phone, and a person walking with a smartwatch.

The NTF model generalizes conventional tensor factorization from two\nperspectives: First, it leverages the long short-term memory architecture to\ncharacterize the multi-dimensional temporal interactions on relational data.\nSecond, it incorporates the multi-layer perceptron structure for learning the\nnon-linearities between different latent factors. Our extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the significant improvement in rating prediction and link\nprediction on dynamic relational data by our NTF model over both neural network\nbased factorization models and other traditional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 01:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

We put an upper limit to the luminosity of the (undetected)\nflat-spectrum radio core. We find steep-spectrum, extended emission within 10\npc of the nuclear position, consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission\nfrom nuclear star formation or from an outflow powered by an active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). A linear spur of radio emission juts out of the nuclear source\ntowards the kpc-scale arcs (detected in radio, Halpha and X-ray bands). From\nthe size, shock velocity, and Balmer line luminosity of the kpc-scale bubble,\nwe estimate that it was inflated by a long-term-average mechanical power ~3-6 x\n10^{41} erg/s over the last 3-6 Myr. This is an order of magnitude more power\nthan can be provided by the current level of star formation, and by the current\naccretion power of the supermassive black hole.

Classic examples include string knots and the genus\n(number of handles) of a surface: no manipulation of a closed string short of\ncutting it changes its \"knottedness\"; and no deformation of a closed surface,\nshort of puncturing it, changes how many handles it has. Topology has recently\nbecome an intense focus of condensed matter physics, where it arises in the\ncontext of the quantum Hall effect [1] and topological insulators [2]. In each\ncase, topology is defined through invariants of the material's bulk [3-5], but\nexperimentally measured through chiral/helical properties of the material's\nedges. In this work we measure topological invariants of a quantum Hall\nmaterial through local response of the bulk: treating the material as a\nmany-port circulator enables direct measurement of the Chern number as the\nspatial winding of the circulator phase; excess density accumulation near\nspatial curvature quantifies the curvature-analog of charge known as mean\norbital spin, while the moment of inertia of this excess density reflects the\nchiral central charge. We observe that the topological invariants converge to\ntheir global values when probed over a few magnetic lengths lB, consistent with\nintuition that the bulk/edge distinction exists only for samples larger than a\nfew lB. By performing these experiments in photonic Landau levels of a twisted\nresonator [6], we apply quantum-optics tools to topological matter.

As a result, texture\nvariations due to changes in scale are amongst the hardest to handle. In this\nwork we conduct the first study of classifying textures with extreme variations\nin scale. To address this issue, we first propose and then reduce scale\nproposals on the basis of dominant texture patterns.

This can lead researchers to perform model comparisons via\nconditional likelihoods, where the latent variables are considered model\nparameters. In other settings, however, typical model comparisons involve\nmarginal likelihoods where the latent variables are integrated out. This\ndistinction is often overlooked despite the fact that it can have a large\nimpact on the comparisons of interest. In this paper, we clarify and illustrate\nthese issues, focusing on the comparison of conditional and marginal Deviance\nInformation Criteria (DICs) and Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAICs) in\npsychometric modeling. The conditional/marginal distinction corresponds to\nwhether the model should be predictive for the clusters that are in the data or\nfor new clusters (where \"clusters\" typically correspond to higher-level units\nlike people or schools). Correspondingly, we show that marginal WAIC\ncorresponds to leave-one-cluster out (LOcO) cross-validation, whereas\nconditional WAIC corresponds to leave-one-unit out (LOuO). These results lead\nto recommendations on the general application of the criteria to models with\nlatent variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 03:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 03:44:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 13:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Static magnetic order was\ncharacterized by obtaining the temperature and doping dependences of the local\nordered magnetic moment size and the volume fraction of the magnetically\nordered regions. For x = 0 and 0.4 %, a transition to a nearly-homogeneous long\nrange magnetically ordered state is observed, while for higher x than 0.4 %\nmagnetic order becomes more disordered and is completely suppressed for x = 1.5\n%. The magnetic volume fraction continuously decreases with increasing x. The\ncombination of magnetic and superconducting volumes implies that a\nspatially-overlapping coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity spans a\nlarge region of the T-x phase diagram for NaFe_1-xNi_xAs . A strong reduction\nof both the ordered moment size and the volume fraction is observed below the\nsuperconducting T_C for x = 0.6, 1.0, and 1.3 %, in contrast to other iron\npnictides in which one of these two parameters exhibits a reduction below TC,\nbut not both. The suppression of magnetic order is further enhanced with\nincreased Ni doping, leading to a reentrant non-magnetic state below T_C for x\n= 1.3 %. The reentrant behavior indicates an interplay between\nantiferromagnetism and superconductivity involving competition for the same\nelectrons. These observations are consistent with the sign-changing s-wave\nsuperconducting state, which is expected to appear on the verge of microscopic\ncoexistence and phase separation with magnetism. We also present a universal\nlinear relationship between the local ordered moment size and the\nantiferromagnetic ordering temperature TN across a variety of iron-based\nsuperconductors. We argue that this linear relationship is consistent with an\nitinerant-electron approach, in which Fermi surface nesting drives\nantiferromagnetic ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 04:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

The spin conductance\ncan be effectively tuned by the tilt with taking advantage of the modified\ninterference condition. A pure spin current reversal also possible with a\nsmooth variation of the tilting. We further study the spin current by the\nadiabatic precession of a doped ferromagnet on top of the material.

In SABRE experiments, pH2 binds to an organometallic\ncomplex with a to-be-polarized substrate; subsequently, spin order transfer\ntakes place and the substrate acquires non-thermal spin polarization resulting\nin strong NMR signal enhancement. In this work we argue that the spin order of\nH2 in SABRE experiments performed at high magnetic fields is not necessarily\nthe singlet order but rather anti-phase polarization, $S_{1z}S_{2z}$. Although\nSABRE exploits pH2, i.e., the starting spin order of H2 is supposed to be the\nsinglet order, in solution S-T0 conversion becomes efficient once pH2 binds to\na complex. Such a variation of the spin order, which becomes $S_{1z}S_{2z}$,\nhas an important consequence: NMR methods used for transferring SABRE\npolarization need to be modified. Here we demonstrate that methods proposed for\nthe initial singlet order may not work for the S_1z S_2z order; however, a\nsimple modification makes them efficient again. A theoretical treatment of the\nproblem under consideration is proposed; these considerations are supported by\nhigh-field SABRE experiments.

Separation between\nparticles allows to imitate (i) the various supporting materials (e.g. TiO2,\nSiO2, etc.), and (ii) the coverage of vanadia on a particular support. A\nsubstantial compensation of the energy loss upon the vanadyl oxygen abstraction\nvia bonding to the vanadyl oxygen of neighboring vanadate particle has been\npredicted. On account of such compensation the overall energy of the V=O\ndissociation reaches its minimal value of 36 kcal/mol (dropping from maximum of\n142 kcal/mol) at small separation of 3 {\\AA} between dimers when the nearest\nvanadyl oxygen occupies a bridge V-O-V position.

An extremely hazardous megathrust earthquake is predicted to occur\nalong the Nankai Trough off southwestern Japan, an economically active and\ndensely populated area with historical records of megathrust earthquakes.\nMegathrust earthquakes are the result of a plate subduction mechanism and occur\nat interplate slip-deficit (or coupling) regions. Many past studies have\nattempted to capture slip-deficit rate (SDR) distributions for assessing future\nearthquake disasters. However, they could not capture a total view of the\nmegathrust earthquake source region because they had no seafloor geodetic data.\nThe Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japan Coast Guard (JHOD)\nhas been developing a highly precise and sustainable seafloor geodetic\nobservation network deployed in this subduction zone to broadly obtain direct\ninformation related to offshore SDR. Here, we present seafloor geodetic\nobservation data and an offshore interplate SDR distribution model. Our data\nsuggests that most offshore regions in this subduction zone have positive SDRs.\nSpecifically, our observations indicate previously unknown high-SDR regions\nthat are important for tsunami disaster mitigation and low-SDR regions that are\nconsistent with distributions of shallow slow earthquakes and subducting\nseamounts. This is the first direct evidence suggesting that coupling\nconditions are related to these seismological and geological phenomena.

The method reaches\narbitrary high order of accuracy in both space and time via the use of\nspace-time basis and test functions. Within the staggered mesh formulation, we\ndefine the discrete velocity field in the control volumes of a primary mesh,\nwhile the discrete stress tensor is defined on a face-based staggered dual\nmesh. The space-time DG formulation leads to an implicit scheme that requires\nthe solution of a linear system for the unknown degrees of freedom at the new\ntime level. The number of unknowns is reduced at the aid of the Schur\ncomplement, so that in the end only a linear system for the degrees of freedom\nof the velocity field needs to be solved. Thanks to the use of a spatially\nstaggered mesh, the stencil of the final velocity system involves only the\nelement and its direct neighbors. The resulting linear system can be\nefficiently solved via matrix-free iterative methods. The chosen discretization\nand the linear nature of the governing PDE system lead to an unconditionally\nstable scheme, which allows large time steps even for low quality meshes that\ncontain sliver elements. The fully discrete staggered space-time DG method is\nproven to be energy stable for any order of accuracy, for any mesh and for any\ntime step size. For the particular case of Crank-Nicolson time discretization\nand homogeneous material, the final velocity system can be proven to be\nsymmetric and positive definite and in this case the scheme is also exactly\nenergy preserving. The new scheme is applied to several test problems in two\nand three space dimensions, providing also a comparison with high order\nexplicit ADER-DG schemes\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 09:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The main advantages of DEVS are its rigourous and precise\nspecification, as well as its support for modular, hierarchical construction of\nmodels. DEVS frequently serves as a simulation \"assembly language\" to which\nmodels in other formalisms are translated, either giving meaning to new\n(domain-specific) languages, or reproducing semantics of existing languages.\nDespite this rigourous definition of its syntax and semantics, initialization\nof DEVS models is left unspecified in both the Classic and Parallel DEVS\nformalism definition. In this paper, we extend the DEVS formalism by including\nan initial total state. Extensions to syntax as well as denotational (closure\nunder coupling) and operational semantics (abstract simulator) are presented.\nThe extension is applicable to both main variants of the DEVS formalism. Our\nextension is such that it adds to, but does not alter the original\nspecification.

Adversarial examples\nare slightly modified inputs that are intentionally designed to cause a\nmisclassification by the model. In the domains of images and speech, the\nmodifications are so small that they are not seen or heard by humans, but\nnevertheless greatly affect the classification of the model.\n  Deep learning models have been successfully applied to malware detection. In\nthis domain, generating adversarial examples is not straightforward, as small\nmodifications to the bytes of the file could lead to significant changes in its\nfunctionality and validity. We introduce a novel loss function for generating\nadversarial examples specifically tailored for discrete input sets, such as\nexecutable bytes. We modify malicious binaries so that they would be detected\nas benign, while preserving their original functionality, by injecting a small\nsequence of bytes (payload) in the binary file. We applied this approach to an\nend-to-end convolutional deep learning malware detection model and show a high\nrate of detection evasion. Moreover, we show that our generated payload is\nrobust enough to be transferable within different locations of the same file\nand across different files, and that its entropy is low and similar to that of\nbenign data sections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 09:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 May 2018 09:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 09:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

On further\nincreasing the pressure beyond the critical point, the band inversion is\nreverted making them trivial insulators. The pressure-induced change in band\ntopology from non-trivial to trivial phase is also captured by L\\\"{u}ttinger\nmodel Hamiltonian calculations. Our model demonstrates the critical role played\nby a pressure-induced anisotropy in frontier bands in driving the phase\ntransitions.

Mixed modes can be\nused to probe the physical conditions in red giant cores. However, we still\nneed to identify the physical mechanisms that transport angular momentum inside\nred giants, leading to the slow-down observed for the red giant core rotation.\nThus large-scale measurements of the red giant core rotation are of prime\nimportance to obtain tighter constraints on the efficiency of the internal\nangular momentum transport, and to study how this efficiency changes with\nstellar parameters. This work aims at identifying the components of the\nrotational multiplets for dipole mixed modes in a large number of red giant\noscillation spectra observed by Kepler. Such identification provides us with a\ndirect measurement of the red giant mean core rotation. We compute stretched\nspectra that mimic the regular pattern of pure dipole gravity modes. Mixed\nmodes with same azimuthal order are expected to be almost equally spaced in\nstretched period. The departure from this regular pattern allows us to\ndisentangle the various rotational components and therefore to determine the\nmean core rotation rates of red giants. We obtained mean core rotation\nmeasurements for 875 red giant branch stars. This large sample includes stars\nwith a mass as large as 2.5 $M_{\\odot}$, allowing us to test the dependence of\nthe core slow-down rate on the stellar mass. This work on a large sample allows\nus to refine previous measurements of the evolution of the mean core rotation\non the red giant branch. Rather than a slight slow down, our results suggest\nrotation to be constant along the red giant branch, with values independent on\nthe mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 11:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Recently, it has been suggested\nthat winds of solar type stars might undergo a change in properties at old\nages, whereby stars older than the Sun would be less efficient in carrying away\nangular momentum than what was traditionally believed. Adding to this, recent\nobservations suggest that old solar-type stars show a break in coronal\nproperties, with a steeper decay in X-ray luminosities and temperatures at\nolder ages. We use these X-ray observations to constrain the thermal\nacceleration of winds of solar analogues. Our sample is based on the stars from\nthe `Sun in time' project with ages between 120-7000 Myr. The break in X-ray\nproperties leads to a break in wind mass-loss rates ($\\dot{M}$) at roughly 2\nGyr, with $\\dot{M}$ (t < 2 Gyr) $\\propto t^{-0.74}$ and $\\dot{M}$ (t > 2 Gyr)\n$\\propto$ $t^{-3.9}$.

We\nproposed the pre-check scheme which is a multi-strategy polar code scheme to\nstrike a balance between reasonable frame error rate (FER) and decoding\nlatency. Three decoders namely binary-input, quantized-soft, and pure-soft\ndecoders are embedded in this scheme. Since the calculation of soft\nlog-likelihood ratio (LLR) inputs needs multiple sensing operations and\noptional quantization boundaries, a 2-bit quantized hard-decision decoder is\nproposed to outperform the hard-decoded LDPC bit-flipping decoder with fewer\nsensing operations. We notice that polar codes have much lower computational\ncomplexity compared to LDPC codes. The stepwise maximum mutual information\n(SMMI) scheme is also proposed to obtain overlapped boundaries without\nexhausting search. The mapping scheme using Gray code is employed and proved to\nachieve better raw error performance compared to other alternatives. Hardware\narchitectures are also given in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 11:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

The best compromises are\ntwo-component adhesives that cure slowly at room temperature and can reach full\npolymerization in minutes, on demand. In this paper, the curing behavior of a\nmodel poly-epoxide adhesive (a stoichiometric mixture of a pure epoxy and\namine) polymerized with infrared radiation will be studied. The kinetic\nfollow-up of this polymerization will be carried out by thermal analysis\n(determination of the residual heat peak by Differential Scanning\nCalorimetry-DSC). This study paves the way to a cold and universal\ncure-on-demand process, which means achieved in few minutes at low temperature\nwithout any initiators, catalysts or accelerators. Basically, infrared curing\ncan be possible thanks to an increase in temperature (called thermal effect).\nBut it has been shown that a \"non-thermal effect\" could also be involved in\naccelerating kinetics with infrared. This increase due to a non-thermal effect,\nsuggested as a function of the infrared radiative flux, has been shown to be\npossible thanks to the absorption of infrared radiation, leading to a reduction\nin the energy barrier of the primary epoxy/amine reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 13:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

This field\napplied to a ferromagnetic insulator with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type coupling\nchanges locally the magnon dispersion and modifies the density of thermally\nexcited magnons in a region of the scale of the field inhomogeneity.

We have previously shown that the Morlet\nspectra of these wave trains in coronal tubes depend crucially on the\ndispersive properties of trapped sausage waves, the existence of cutoff axial\nwavenumbers and the monotonicity of the dependence of the axial group speed on\nthe axial wavenumber in particular. This study examines the difference a slab\ngeometry may introduce, for which purpose we conduct a comprehensive eigenmode\nanalysis, both analytically and numerically, on trapped sausage modes in\ncoronal slabs with a considerable number of density profiles. For the profile\ndescriptions examined, coronal slabs can trap sausage waves with longer axial\nwavelengths, and the group speed approaches the internal Alfv\\'en speed more\nrapidly at large wavenumbers in the cylindrical case. However, common to both\ngeometries, cutoff wavenumbers exist only when the density profile falls\nsufficiently rapidly at distances far from coronal structures. Likewise, the\nmonotonicity of the group speed curves depends critically on the profile\nsteepness right at the structure axis. Furthermore, the Morlet spectra of the\nwave trains are shaped by the group speed curves for coronal slabs and tubes\nalike.

The approach is based on the delta-ramp encoder which consists of\napplying a one-level level-crossing detector to the result of adding an\nappropriate sawtooth-like waveform to the input signal. The output samples are\nthe time instants of these level crossings, thus representing a time-encoded\nversion of the input signal. For theoretical purposes, this system can be\nequivalently analyzed by reversibly transforming through ramp addition a\nnonmonotonic input signal into a monotonic one which is then uniformly sampled\nin amplitude. The monotonic function is then represented by the times at which\nthe signal crosses a predefined and equally-spaced set of amplitude values. We\nrefer to this technique as amplitude sampling.

Indeed, the theory can in principle\nbe applied to all spacetimes and adapted to other `metric' theories of gravity.\nInstructive examples are developed along with the general theory. In\nparticular, we obtain an alternative description for accelerated frames of\nreference in Minkowski spacetime.\n  Further, we use the splitting formalism to motivate a new mathematical\napproach to the Newtonian limit of the motion of mass points. This employs a\ngeneral formula for their observed motion, distinguishing between `actual'\nforces (i.e. those detectable via an accelerometer) and pseudo-forces.

Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance\nwith age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with\nthose that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks.\nThese findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of\ncortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 01:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

Due to budget and time constraints, engineers typically rely on\nengineering judgment and prior experience when selecting a structural system,\noften considering a limited range of design alternatives. The objective of this\nstudy was to explore the suitability of supervised machine learning as a\npreliminary design aid that provides guidance to engineers with regards to the\nstatistically optimal bridge type to choose, ultimately improving the\nlikelihood of optimized design, design standardization, and reduced maintenance\ncosts. In order to devise this supervised learning system, data for over\n600,000 bridges from the National Bridge Inventory database were analyzed. Key\nattributes for determining the bridge structure type were identified through\nthree feature selection techniques. Potentially useful attributes like seismic\nintensity and historic data on the cost of materials (steel and concrete) were\nthen added from the US Geological Survey (USGS) database and Engineering News\nRecord. Decision tree, Bayes network and Support Vector Machines were used for\npredicting the bridge design type. Due to state-to-state variations in material\navailability, material costs, and design codes, supervised learning models\nbased on the complete data set did not yield favorable results. Supervised\nlearning models were then trained and tested using 10-fold cross validation on\ndata for each state. Inclusion of seismic data improved the model performance\nnoticeably. The data was then resampled to reduce the bias of the models\ntowards more common design types, and the supervised learning models thus\nconstructed showed further improvements in performance. The average recall and\nprecision for the state models was 88.6% and 88.0% using Decision Trees, 84.0%\nand 83.7% using Bayesian Networks, and 80.8% and 75.6% using SVM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}
