The use of AP source code annotations defines a\nprotocol specifying how object references can access the mutable state of\nobjects. Although the use of APs simplifies the task of writing concurrent\ncode, an unsystematic use of them can lead to subtle problems. This paper\npresents a declarative interpretation of APs as Linear Concurrent Constraint\nPrograms (lcc). We represent APs as constraints (i.e., formulas in logic) in an\nunderlying constraint system whose entailment relation models the\ntransformation rules of APs. Moreover, we use processes in lcc to model the\ndependencies imposed by APs, thus allowing the faithful representation of their\nflow in the program. We verify relevant properties about AP programs by taking\nadvantage of the interpretation of lcc processes as formulas in Girard's\nintuitionistic linear logic (ILL). Properties include deadlock detection,\nprogram correctness (whether programs adhere to their AP specifications or\nnot), and the ability of methods to run concurrently. By relying on a focusing\ndiscipline for ILL, we provide a complexity measure for proofs of the above\nmentioned properties. The effectiveness of our verification techniques is\ndemonstrated by implementing the Alcove tool that includes an animator and a\nverifier. The former executes the lcc model, observing the flow of APs and\nquickly finding inconsistencies of the APs vis-a-vis the implementation. The\nlatter is an automatic theorem prover based on ILL. This paper is under\nconsideration for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming\n(TPLP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 16:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

Whereas asteroid observations are\ncurrently unable to pinpoint the source regions of most meteorite classes,\nobservations of meteors with camera networks and the subsequent recovery of the\nmeteorite may help make progress on this question. The main caveat of such an\napproach, however, is that the recovery rate of meteorite falls is low,\nimplying that the meteoritic analogues of at least 80% of the observed falls\nremain unknown.\n  Aims: Spectroscopic observations of bolides may have the potential to\nmitigate this problem by classifying the incoming material.\n  Methods: To probe the use of spectroscopy to determine the meteoritic\nanalogues of bolides, we collected emission spectra in the visible range\n(320-880nm) of five meteorite types (H,L,LL,CM,eucrite) acquired in atmospheric\nentry-like conditions in a plasma wind tunnel at the University of Stuttgart\n(Germany). A detailed spectral analysis including line identification and mass\nratio determinations (Mg/Fe,Na/Fe) was subsequently performed on all spectra.\n  Results: Spectroscopy, via a simple line identification, allows us to\ndistinguish the main meteorite classes (chondrites, achondrites and irons) but\ndoes not have the potential to distinguish for example an H from a CM\nchondrite.\n  Conclusions: The source location within the main belt of the different\nmeteorite classes (H, L, LL, CM, etc.) should continue to be investigated via\nfireball observation networks. Spectroscopy of incoming bolides only marginally\nhelps precisely classify the incoming material (iron meteorites only). To reach\na statistically significant sample of recovered meteorites along with accurate\norbits (>100) within a reasonable time frame (10-20 years), the optimal\nsolution may be the spatial extension of existing fireball observation\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 16:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

In particular, for a specific Bell experiment, one can\nderive relations between the amount of randomness produced, as quantified by\nthe min-entropy of the output data, and its associated violation of a Bell\ninequality. In practice, due to finite sampling, certifying randomness requires\nthe development of statistical tools to lower-bound the min-entropy of the data\nas a function of the estimated Bell violation. The quality of such bounds\nrelies on the choice of certificate, i.e., the Bell inequality whose violation\nis estimated. In this work, we propose a method for choosing efficiently such a\ncertificate. It requires sacrificing a part of the output data in order to\nestimate the underlying correlations. Regularising this estimate then allows\none to find a Bell inequality that is well suited for certifying practical\nrandomness from these specific correlations.

This conclusion is mitigated by lack\nof detailed knowledge of the emission region geometry, which requires deeper or\nhigher resolution X-ray observations. Furthermore, if the IC-CMB model is valid\nfor X-ray emission from kpc-scale jets, then the jets must decelerate on\naverage: bulk Lorentz factors should drop from about 15 to 2-3 between pc and\nkpc scales. Our results compound the problems that the IC-CMB model has in\nexplaining the X-ray emission of kpc-scale jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 16:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

In this study we present observations of the extremely widespread SEP\nevent of 26 Dec 2013. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the widest\nlongitudinal SEP distribution ever observed together with unusually\nlong-lasting energetic electron anisotropies at all observer positions. Further\nstriking features of the event are long-lasting SEP intensity increases, two\ndistinct SEP components with the second component mainly consisting of\nhigh-energy particles, a complex associated coronal activity including a\npronounced signature of a shock in radio type-II observations, and the\ninteraction of two CMEs early in the event. The observations require a\nprolonged injection scenario not only for protons but also for electrons. We\ntherefore analyze the data comprehensively to characterize the possible role of\nthe shock for the electron event. Remote-sensing observations of the complex\nsolar activity are combined with in-situ measurements of the particle event. We\nalso apply a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to the coronagraph\nobservations of the two associated CMEs to analyze their interaction.

Following this\ninitial mock-up, the design artifacts are then handed off to developers whose\ngoal is to accurately implement these GUIs and the desired functionality in\ncode. Given the sizable abstraction gap between mock-ups and code, developers\noften introduce mistakes related to the GUI that can negatively impact an app's\nsuccess in highly competitive marketplaces. Moreover, such mistakes are common\nin the evolutionary context of rapidly changing apps. This leads to the\ntime-consuming and laborious task of design teams verifying that each screen of\nan app was implemented according to intended design specifications.\n  This paper introduces a novel, automated approach for verifying whether the\nGUI of a mobile app was implemented according to its intended design. Our\napproach resolves GUI-related information from both implemented apps and\nmock-ups and uses computer vision techniques to identify common errors in the\nimplementations of mobile GUIs.

The results show that GVT solves an important,\ndifficult, and highly practical problem with remarkable efficiency and accuracy\nand is both useful and scalable from the point of view of industrial designers\nand developers.

For the pricing between\nthe InP and the MNOs, we formulate a Stackelberg game with the InP as the\nleader and multiple MNOs as the followers. In this virtualized scenario, the\ncommon cost of renting the infrastructure is shared in a fair manner among the\nMNOs by using the Shapely value. An efficient algorithm is provided to divide\nthe rent among MNOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) measures the\ninterplanetary, interstellar and planetary dust in our solar system since 1999\nand provided unique discoveries. In 1999, CDA detected interstellar dust in the\ninner solar system followed by the detection of electrical charges of\ninterplanetary dust grains during the cruise phase between Earth and Jupiter.\nThe instrument determined the composition of interplanetary dust and the\nnanometre sized dust streams originating from Jupiter's moon Io. During the\napproach to Saturn in 2004, similar streams of submicron grains with speeds in\nthe order of 100 km/s were detected from Saturn's inner and outer ring system\nand are released to the interplanetary magnetic field. Since 2004 CDA measured\nmore than one million dust impacts characterizing the dust environment of\nSaturn. The instrument is one of three experiments which discovered the active\nice geysers located at the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus in 2005.\nLater, a detailed compositional analysis of the water ice grains in Saturn's E\nring system lead to the discovery of large reservoirs of liquid water (oceans)\nbelow the icy crust of Enceladus. Finally, the determination of the dust-\nmagnetosphere interaction and the discovery of the extended E ring (at least\ntwice as large as predicted) allowed the definition of a dynamical dust model\nof Saturn's E ring describing the observed properties. This paper summarizes\nthe discoveries of a ten year story of success based on reliable measurements\nwith the most advanced dust detector flown in space until today. This paper\nfocuses on cruise results and findings achieved at Saturn with a focus on flux\nand density measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

In high-dimensional chaotic attractors,\ntrajectories are prone to travel through quite different regions of phase\nspace, some far more unstable than others. This heterogeneity makes\npredictability even more difficult than in low-dimensional homogeneous chaotic\nattractors. A chaotic attractor is \"multi-chaotic\" if every point of the\nattractor is arbitrarily close to periodic points with different numbers of\nunstable dimensions. We believe that most physical systems possessing a\nhigh-dimensional attractor are of this type. We make three conjectures about\nmulti-chaos which we explore using three two-dimensional paradigmatic examples\nof multi-chaotic attractors.

One explanation for these features is that relativistic distortion\nof the accretion disc's differential rotation creates a trapping region in\nwhich inertial waves (r-modes) might grow to observable amplitudes. Local\nanalyses, however, predict that large-scale magnetic fields push this trapping\nregion to the inner disc edge, where conditions may be unfavorable for r-mode\ngrowth. We revisit this problem from a pseudo-Newtonian but fully global\nperspective, deriving linearized equations describing a relativistic,\nmagnetized accretion flow, and calculating normal modes with and without\nvertical density stratification. In an unstratified model, the choice of\nvertical wavenumber determines the extent to which vertical magnetic fields\ndrive the r-modes toward the inner edge. In a global model fully incorporating\ndensity stratification, we confirm that this susceptibility to magnetic fields\ndepends on disc thickness. Our calculations suggest that in thin discs, r-modes\nmay remain independent of the inner disc edge for vertical magnetic fields with\nplasma betas as low as $\\beta\\approx 100-300$.

Synaptic inhibition suppresses the output firing activity of\na neuron, and is commonly classified as having a subtractive or divisive effect\non a neuron's output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the\nrange of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to\nnon-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it\nmodifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing\nactivity. Since these two \"modes\" of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural\ncoding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that\ndistinguish these response profiles.\n  We use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the\nspecific conditions for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive\neffects. We identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (IA). In our\nmodel, this fast-activating, slowly- inactivating outward current acts as a\nswitch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. If IA is strong (large\nmaximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike\ninitiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In\ncontrast, if IA is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has\na divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical\nsystems methods to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic\ninputs and IA.\n  Our findings suggest that neurons can \"self-regulate\" the gain control\neffects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation\nof the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role\nfor IA would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent\nobservations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the\nsolitary tract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Unexpected detections of a significant ISM in many post-starbursts\nraise important questions. Are they truly quiescent and, if so, what mechanisms\ninhibit further star formation? What processes dominate their ISM energetics?\nWe present an infrared spectroscopic and photometric survey of 33 SDSS-selected\nE+A post-starbursts, aimed at resolving these questions. We find compact, warm\ndust reservoirs with high PAH abundances, and total gas and dust masses\nsignificantly higher than expected from stellar recycling alone. Both PAH/TIR\nand dust-to-burst stellar mass ratios are seen to decrease with post-burst age,\nindicative of the accumulating effects of dust destruction and an incipient\ntransition to hot, early-type ISM properties.

There is substantial scatter among SFR indicators, and both PAH and\nTIR luminosities provide overestimates. Even as potential upper limits, all\ntracers show that the SFR has typically experienced a more than two\norder-of-magnitude decline since the starburst, and that the SFR is\nconsiderably lower than expected given both their stellar masses and molecular\ngas densities.

Recently many deep\nlearning based predicted models are also developed for EHR data and\ndemonstrated impressive performance.

In\nthe context of medical informatics, such attacks could alter the result of a\nhigh performance deep predictive model by slightly perturbing a patient's\nmedical records.

Key to these phenomena is quantum interference, which\narises if two of the three available transitions are coherently driven at\nwell-controlled amplitudes and phases. The additional coherent driving of the\nthird available transition would form a closed-contour interaction (CCI) from\nwhich fundamentally new phenomena would emerge, including phase-controlled CPT\nand one atom interferometry. However, due to the difficulty in experimentally\nrealising a fully coherent CCI, such aspects of three-level systems remain\nunexplored as of now. Here, we exploit recently developed methods for coherent\ndriving of single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) electronic spins to implement highly\ncoherent CCI driving. Our experiments reveal phase-controlled, single spin\nquantum interference fringes, reminiscent of electron dynamics on a triangular\nlattice, with the driving field phases playing the role of a synthetic magnetic\nflux. We find that for suitable values of this phase, CCI driving leads to\nefficient coherence protection of the NV spin, yielding a nearly two orders of\nmagnitude improvement of the coherence time, even for moderate drive strengths\n<~1MHz.

This paper addresses the problem of estimating\nself-excitation parameters and inferring the underlying functional network\nstructure from self-exciting point process data.

Current knowledge graphs contain only a small\nsubset of what is true in the world. Link prediction approaches aim at\npredicting new links for a knowledge graph given the existing links among the\nentities. Tensor factorization approaches have proved promising for such link\nprediction problems. Proposed in 1927, Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition is\namong the first tensor factorization approaches. CP generally performs poorly\nfor link prediction as it learns two independent embedding vectors for each\nentity, whereas they are really tied. We present a simple enhancement of CP\n(which we call SimplE) to allow the two embeddings of each entity to be learned\ndependently. The complexity of SimplE grows linearly with the size of\nembeddings. The embeddings learned through SimplE are interpretable, and\ncertain types of background knowledge can be incorporated into these embeddings\nthrough weight tying.

As any other kind of digital images, overhead pictures\ncan also be easily forged. However, common image forensic techniques are often\ndeveloped for consumer camera images, which strongly differ in their nature\nfrom satellite ones (e.g., compression schemes, post-processing, sensors,\netc.). Therefore, many accurate state-of-the-art forensic algorithms are bound\nto fail if blindly applied to overhead image analysis. Development of novel\nforensic tools for satellite images is paramount to assess their authenticity\nand integrity. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for satellite image\nforgery detection and localization. Specifically, we consider the scenario in\nwhich pixels within a region of a satellite image are replaced to add or remove\nan object from the scene. Our algorithm works under the assumption that no\nforged images are available for training. Using a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN), we learn a feature representation of pristine satellite images.\nA one-class support vector machine (SVM) is trained on these features to\ndetermine their distribution. Finally, image forgeries are detected as\nanomalies. The proposed algorithm is validated against different kinds of\nsatellite images containing forgeries of different size and shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 22:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-15"}

An intelligence analyst has observed some\nsignals, but the situation is rapidly changing. The analyst faces the decision\nto alert a principal decision maker that an attack is imminent, or to wait\nuntil more is known about the situation. This warning decision is based on the\nanalyst's observation and evaluation of signals, independent or correlated, and\non her updating of the prior probabilities of possible scenarios and their\noutcomes. The warning decision also depends on the analyst's assessment of the\ncrisis' dynamics and perception of the preferences of the principal decision\nmaker, as well as the lead time needed for an appropriate response. This\narticle presents a model to support this analyst's dynamic warning decision. As\nwith most problems involving warning, the key is to manage the tradeoffs\nbetween false positives and false negatives given the probabilities and the\nconsequences of intelligence failures of both types. The model is illustrated\nby revisiting the case of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. It shows\nthat the radio silence of the Japanese fleet carried considerable information\n(Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"dog in the night\" problem), which was misinterpreted\nat the time.

A\nField-Programmable DNN learning and inference accelerator (FProg-DNN) using\nhybrid systolic and non-systolic techniques, distributed information-control\nand deep pipelined structure is proposed and its microarchitecture and\noperation presented here. Reconfigurability attends diverse DNN designs and\nallows for different number of workers to be assigned to different layers as a\nfunction of the relative difference in computational load among layers. The\ncomputational delay per layer is made roughly the same along pipelined\naccelerator structure. VGG-16 and recently proposed Inception Modules are used\nfor showing the flexibility of the FProg-DNN reconfigurability. Special\nstructures were also added for a combination of convolution layer, map\ncoincidence and feedback for state of the art learning with small set of\nexamples, which is the focus of a companion paper by the author (Franca-Neto,\n2018). The accelerator described is able to reconfigure from (1) allocating all\na DNN computations to a single worker in one extreme of sub-optimal performance\nto (2) optimally allocating workers per layer according to computational load\nin each DNN layer to be realized. Due the pipelined architecture, more than 50x\nspeedup is achieved relative to GPUs or TPUs. This speed-up is consequence of\nhiding the delay in transporting activation outputs from one layer to the next\nin a DNN behind the computations in the receiving layer.

Here\nwe interpret it more modestly as an alternative to Einstein-Maxwell theory,\napproximating the coupling between the electromagnetic field and spacetime\ncurvature in the macroscopic classical regime. Previously it was shown that the\nLorentz force can be derived from this theory, albeit with deviation on the\nscale of a universal length constant $\\ell$. Here we assume that $\\ell$ is of\ngalactic scale and show that the modified coupling of the electromagnetic field\nwith charged particles allows a non-Maxwellian equilibrium of non-neutral\nplasma. The resulting electromagnetic field is \"dark\" in the sense that its\nmodified Lorentz force on the plasma vanishes, yet through its modified\ncoupling to the gravitational field it engenders a nonvanishing, effective mass\ndensity. We obtain a solution for which this mass density asymptotes\napproximately to that of the pseudo-isothermal model of dark matter. The\nresulting gravitational field produces radial acceleration, in the context of a\npost-Minkowskian approximation, which is negligible at small radius but yields\na flat rotation curve at large radius. We further exhibit a family of such\nsolutions which, like the pseudo-isothermal model, has a free parameter to set\nthe mass scale (in this case related to the charge density) and a free\nparameter to set the length scale (in this case an integer multiple of $\\ell$).\nMoreover, these solutions are members of a larger family with more general\nangular and radial dependence. They thus show promise as approximations of\ngeneralized pseudo-isothermal models, which in turn are known to fit a wide\nrange of mass density profiles for galaxies and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 01:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

A binary adjacency\nmatrix is commonly used in training a GCN. Recently, the attention mechanism\nallows the network to learn a dynamic and adaptive aggregation of the\nneighborhood. We propose a new GCN model on the graphs where edges are\ncharacterized in multiple views or precisely in terms of multiple\nrelationships. For instance, in chemical graph theory, compound structures are\noften represented by the hydrogen-depleted molecular graph where nodes\ncorrespond to atoms and edges correspond to chemical bonds. Multiple attributes\ncan be important to characterize chemical bonds, such as atom pair (the types\nof atoms that a bond connects), aromaticity, and whether a bond is in a ring.\nThe different attributes lead to different graph representations for the same\nmolecule. There is growing interests in both chemistry and machine learning\nfields to directly learn molecular properties of compounds from the molecular\ngraph, instead of from fingerprints predefined by chemists. The proposed GCN\nmodel, which we call edge attention-based multi-relational GCN (EAGCN), jointly\nlearns attention weights and node features in graph convolution. For each bond\nattribute, a real-valued attention matrix is used to replace the binary\nadjacency matrix. By designing a dictionary for the edge attention, and forming\nthe attention matrix of each molecule by looking up the dictionary, the EAGCN\nexploits correspondence between bonds in different molecules. The prediction of\ncompound properties is based on the aggregated node features, which is\nindependent of the varying molecule (graph) size.

However, applications of such networks often work with a\nprojected (one-mode) version of the original bipartite network. The topology of\nthe projected network, and the dynamics that take place on it, are highly\ndependent on the degree distributions of the two different node types from the\noriginal bipartite structure. To date, the interaction between the degree\ndistributions of bipartite networks and their one-mode projections is well\nunderstood for only a few cases, or for networks that satisfy a restrictive set\nof assumptions. Here we show a broader analysis in order to fill the gap left\nby previous studies. We use the formalism of generating functions to prove that\nthe degree distributions of both node types in the original bipartite network\naffect the degree distribution in the projected version. To support our\nanalysis, we simulate several types of synthetic bipartite networks using a\nconfiguration model where node degrees are assigned from specific probability\ndistributions, ranging from peaked to heavy-tailed distributions. Our findings\nshow that when projecting a bipartite network onto a particular set of nodes,\nthe degree distribution for the resulting one-mode network follows the\ndistribution of the nodes being projected on to, but only so long as the degree\ndistribution for the opposite set of nodes does not have a heavier tail.\nFurthermore, we show that bipartite degree distributions are not the only\nfeature driving topology formation of projected networks, in contrast to what\nis commonly described in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 04:38:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 02:17:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 14:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

In this work, we consider the estimation of a function\n$f:\\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\R$ based solely on a dissimilarity measure\n$d:\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\R$ between inputs. In particular,\nwe propose a general framework to derive a family of \\emph{positive definite\nkernels} from a given dissimilarity measure, which subsumes the widely-used\n\\emph{representative-set method} as a special case, and relates to the\nwell-known \\emph{distance substitution kernel} in a limiting case.

The UGKS multiphase (UGKS-M) is a finite\nvolume method, which captures flow physics in the regimes from collisionless\nmultispecies transport to the two-fluid hydrodynamic Navier-Stokes (NS)\nsolution with the variation of Knudsen number, and from granular flow regime to\ndusty gas dynamics with the variation of Stokes number. The main reason for\npreserving the multiscale nature in UGKS-M is mainly coming from the direct\nmodeling of the flow physics in the scales of discrete cell size and time step,\nwhere the ratio of the time step over the particle collision time determines\nflow behavior in different regimes. For the particle phase, the integral\nsolution of the kinetic equation is used in the construction of the numerical\nflux, which takes into account the particle transport, collision, and\nacceleration. The gas phase, which is assumed to be in the continuum flow\nregime, evolves numerically by the gas kinetic scheme (GKS), which is a subset\nof the UGKS for the Navier-Stokes (NS) solutions. The interaction between the\ngas and particle phase is calculated based on a velocity space mapping method,\nwhich solves accurately the kinetic acceleration process. The stability of\nUGKS-M is determined by the CFL condition only. With the inclusion of the\nmaterial temperature evolution equation of solid particles, the UGKS-M\nconserves the total mass, momentum, and energy for the whole multiphase system.\nIn the numerical tests, the UGKS-M shows good multiscale property in capturing\nthe particle trajectory crossing (PTC), particle wall reflecting phenomena, and\nvortex-induced segregation of inertial particles under different Stokes\nnumbers. The scheme is also applied to simulate shock induced fluidization\nproblem and the simulation results agree well with experimental measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 05:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 01:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

In near-equilibrium\nflow regions, particle distribution function is close to the Chapman-Enskog\nexpansion and can be formulated with a continuous velocity space, where only\nmacroscopic conservative variables are updated. With the emerging of\nnon-equilibrium effects, the AUGKS automatically switches to a discrete\nvelocity space to follow the evolution of particle distribution function. Based\non the Chapman-Enskog expansion, a criterion is proposed in this paper to\nquantify the intensity of non-equilibrium effects and is used for the\ncontinuous-discrete velocity space transformation. Following the\nscale-dependent local evolution solution, the AUGKS presents the discretized\ngas dynamic equations directly on the cell size and time step scales, i.e., the\nso-called direct modeling method. As a result, the scheme is able to capture\nthe cross-scale flow physics from particle transport to hydrodynamic wave\npropagation, and provides a continuous variation of solutions from the\nBoltzmann to the Navier-Stokes. Under the unified framework, different from\nconventional DSMC-NS hybrid method, the AUGKS does not need a buffer zone to\nmatch up kinetic and hydrodynamic solutions. Instead, a continuous and discrete\nparticle velocity space is naturally connected, which is feasible for the\nnumerical simulations with unsteadiness or complex geometries. Compared with\nthe asymptotic preserving (AP) methods which solves kinetic equations uniformly\nover the entire flow field with discretized velocity space, the current\nvelocity-space adaptive unified scheme speeds up the computation and reduces\nthe memory requirement in multiscale flow problems, and maintains the\nequivalent accuracy.

Unfortunately, there is no consolidated\nand widely accepted metric for measuring performance quality in all of its\nfacets. In this paper, we design and implement PlayeRank, a data-driven\nframework that offers a principled multi-dimensional and role-aware evaluation\nof the performance of soccer players. We build our framework by deploying a\nmassive dataset of soccer-logs and consisting of millions of match events\npertaining to four seasons of 18 prominent soccer competitions. By comparing\nPlayeRank to known algorithms for performance evaluation in soccer, and by\nexploiting a dataset of players' evaluations made by professional soccer\nscouts, we show that PlayeRank significantly outperforms the competitors. We\nalso explore the ratings produced by {\\sf PlayeRank} and discover interesting\npatterns about the nature of excellent performances and what distinguishes the\ntop players from the others. At the end, we explore some applications of\nPlayeRank -- i.e. searching players and player versatility --- showing its\nflexibility and efficiency, which makes it worth to be used in the design of a\nscalable platform for soccer analytics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 08:43:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 12:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 13:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

We first recall the two possible paths\nthat may be used in this process. The first path, called here the\nDepoissonisation path, is better studied and is proven to apply in any\npractical situation; however, it often uses technical tools, that are not so\neasy to deal with. Moreover, the various results are scattered in the\nlitterature, and the most recent results are not well known within the AofA\ndomain. The present paper gathers in Section 2 all these results in a survey\nstyle. The second path, called here the Rice-Mellin path, is less often used\nwithin the AofA domain. It is often very easy to apply, but it needs a tameness\ncondition, which appears {\\em a priori} to be quite restrictive, and is not\ndeeply studiedin the litterature. In Section 3, the paper precisely describes\nthe Rice-Mellin path, together with its tameness condition, in a survey style,\ntoo. Finally, in Section 4, the paper presents original results for the\nRice-Mellin path: it exhibits a framework, of practical use, where the tameness\ncondition is proven to hold. It then proves that the Rice-Mellin path is both\nof easy and practical use : even though (much?) less general than the\nDepoissonisation path, it is easier to apply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 08:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-15"}

Using high entropy passwords is critical to\nprevent unauthorized access and password policies emerged to enforce this\nrequirement on passwords. However, with current methods of password storage,\npoor practices and server breaches have leaked many passwords to the public. To\nprotect one's sensitive information in case of such events, passwords should be\nhidden from servers. Verifier-based password authenticated key exchange,\nproposed by Bellovin and Merrit (IEEE S\\&P, 1992), allows authenticated secure\nchannels to be established with a hash of a password (verifier). Unfortunately,\nthis restricts password policies as passwords cannot be checked from their\nverifier. To address this issue, Kiefer and Manulis (ESORICS 2014) proposed\nzero-knowledge password policy check (ZKPPC). A ZKPPC protocol allows users to\nprove in zero knowledge that a hash of the user's password satisfies the\npassword policy required by the server. Unfortunately, their proposal is not\nquantum resistant with the use of discrete logarithm-based cryptographic tools\nand there are currently no other viable alternatives. In this work, we\nconstruct the first post-quantum ZKPPC using lattice-based tools. To this end,\nwe introduce a new randomised password hashing scheme for ASCII-based passwords\nand design an accompanying zero-knowledge protocol for policy compliance.\nInterestingly, our proposal does not follow the framework established by Kiefer\nand Manulis and offers an alternate construction without homomorphic\ncommitments. Although our protocol is not ready to be used in practice, we\nthink it is an important first step towards a quantum-resistant\nprivacy-preserving password-based authentication and key exchange system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 09:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-15"}

Experimental evidence suggests that under the low\natmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars, gas can flow upwards through\nporous Martian soil due to thermal creep under surface regions heated by the\nSun, and disturb small particles. Here we present numerical simulations to\ndemonstrate that such a dry process involving the pumping of rarefied gas in\nthe Martian soil due to temperature contrasts can explain the formation of the\nrecurring slope lineae. In our simulations, solar irradiation followed by\nshadow significantly reduces the angle of repose due to the resulting temporary\ntemperature gradients over shaded terrain, and leads to flow at intermediate\nslope angles. The simulated flow locations are consistent with observed\nrecurring slope lineae that initiate in rough and bouldered terrains with local\nshadows over the soil.

They allow the scanning of a\nspectral line by sampling the Stokes profiles with 2D images at each line\nposition, but require a compromise between spectral resolution and temporal\ncadence. We evaluate the impact of the time-dependent acquisition of different\nwavelengths on the inversion of spectropolarimetric profiles from chromospheric\nlines during umbral flashes. Simulations of non-linear wave propagation in a\nsunspot were performed with the code MANCHA. Synthetic Stokes parameters in the\nCa II 8542 A line in NLTE were computed for an umbral flash using the code\nNICOLE. Artificial profiles with the same wavelength coverage and temporal\ncadence from reported observations were constructed and inverted. The inferred\natmospheric stratifications were compared with the original models. The\ninferred atmospheres provide a reasonable characterization of the thermodynamic\nproperties of the atmosphere during most of the phases of the umbral flash.\nOnly at the early stages of the flash, when the shock wave reaches the\nformation height of the line, the Stokes profiles present apparent wavelength\nshifts and other spurious deformations. These features are misinterpreted by\nthe inversion code, which can return unrealistic atmospheric models from a good\nfit of the Stokes profiles. The misguided results include flashed atmospheres\nwith strong downflows, even though the simulation exhibits upflows during the\numbral flash, and large variations in the magnetic field strength. Our analyses\nvalidate the inversion of Stokes profiles acquired by sequentially scanning\ncertain selected wavelengths of a line profile, even in the case of\nrapidly-changing events such as umbral flashes. However, the inversions are\nunreliable during a short period at the development phase of the flash.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 10:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

After some random amount of time\n{\\em all the balls} of any urn are redistributed locally, among the $h_N$ urns\nof its neighborhood. The allocation of balls is done at random according to a\nset of weights which depend on the state of the system. The main original\nfeatures of this context is that the cardinality $h_N$ of the range of\ninteraction is not necessarily linear with respect to $N$ as in a classical\nmean-field context and, also, that the number of simultaneous jumps of the\nprocess is not bounded due to the redistribution of all balls of an urn at the\nsame time. The approach relies on the analysis of the evolution of the local\nempirical distributions associated to the state of urns located in the\nneighborhood of a given urn. Under convenient conditions, by taking an\nappropriate Wasserstein distance and by establishing several technical\nestimates for local empirical distributions, we are able to prove mean-field\nconvergence results.\n  When the load per node goes to infinity, a convergence result for the\ninvariant distribution of the associated McKean-Vlasov process is obtained for\nseveral allocation policies.

The first algorithm solves\nheuristically the dualized problem, a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear\nprogram (MINLP), via an alternating optimization approach. The second algorithm\nsolves the MINLP exactly for $k=2$ through a dedicated spatial branch-and-bound\nalgorithm. The third approach enumerates $k$-tuples, relying on strong bounds\nto avoid a complete enumeration. We test our methods on shortest path instances\nthat were used in the previous literature and on randomly generated knapsack\ninstances, and find that our methods considerably outperform previous\napproaches. Many instances that were previously not solved within hours can now\nbe solved within few minutes, often even faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 12:46:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 14:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 16:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-28"}

This ultra-deep\ndataset offers unprecedented sensitivity for detecting X-ray sources in the GC,\ndown to an intrinsic 2--10 keV luminosity of\n$1.0\\times10^{31}{\\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$. A total of 3619 sources are detected in the\n2--8 keV band, among which $\\sim$3500 are probable GC sources and $\\sim$1300\nare new identifications.

Taking advantage of this unprecedented sample of\nfaint X-ray sources that primarily traces the old stellar populations in the\nNSC, we revisit global source properties, including long-term variability,\ncumulative spectra, luminosity function and spatial distribution. Based on the\nequivalent width and relative strength of the iron lines, we suggest that in\naddition to the arguably predominant population of magnetic cataclysmic\nvariables (CVs), non-magnetic CVs contribute substantially to the detected\nsources, especially in the lower-luminosity group. On the other hand, the X-ray\nsources have a radial distribution closely following the stellar mass\ndistribution in the NSC, but much flatter than that of the known X-ray\ntransients, which are presumably low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) caught in\noutburst. This, together with the very modest long-term variability of the\ndetected sources, strongly suggests that quiescent LMXBs are a minor\n($\\lesssim$ a few percent) population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 12:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

The\ncurrent study was aimed at exploring the effects of elastic nonlinearity of the\nfibers contained in the extracellular matrix (ECM) on the transmission of\nmechanical loads between contracting cells. Based on our biological\nexperiments, we developed a finite-element model of two contracting cells\nembedded within a fibrous network. The individual fibers were modeled as\nshowing either linear elasticity, compression-microbuckling, tension-stiffening\nor both of the latter. Compression-buckling resulted in smaller loads occurring\nin the ECM, but these were more directed toward the neighboring cell. The\nlatter decreased with increasing cell-to-cell distance; when cells were >15\ncell-diameters apart, no such inter-cellular interaction was observed.\nTension-stiffening further contributed to directing the loads toward the\nneighboring cell, though to a smaller extent. The contraction of two\nneighboring cells resulted in mutual attraction forces, which were considerably\nincreased by tension-stiffening, and decayed with increasing cell-to-cell\ndistances. Nonlinear elasticity contributed also to the onset of force polarity\non the cell boundary. The density and alignment of the fibers within the\ninter-cellular band were considerably greater when fibers buckled under\ncompression, with tension-stiffening further contributing to this structural\nremodeling. Our model demonstrates the contribution of nonlinear elasticity of\nbiological gels to directionality and efficiency of mechanical-signal transfer\nbetween distant cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 12:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Thanks\nto their exploration of the proton kinematics and of kinematic imbalances\nbetween the proton and muon kinematics, the results offer a novel probe of the\nnuclear-medium effects most pertinent to the (sub-)GeV neutrino-nucleus\ninteractions that are used in accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino\noscillation measurements.

In case of events without a proton above a detection threshold in\nthe final state, a fully consistent implementation of the local Fermi gas model\nwith multinucleon interactions gives the best description of the data. In the\ncase of at least one proton in the final state the spectral function model\nagrees well with the data, most notably when measuring the kinematic imbalance\nbetween the muon and the proton in the plane transverse to the incoming\nneutrino.

Two sources also showed a relatively\nfast rising MIR LCs. They consist of 61% sample of the WISE MIR variable\nnon-Seyfert galaxies with SDSS spectra. In a comparison sample of optically\nselected Seyfert galaxies, the fraction of sources with such a LC is only 15%.\nAfter rejecting 5 plausible obscured Seyfert galaxies with red MIR colours,\nremaining 14 objects are studied in detail in this paper. We fit the declining\npart of LC with an exponential law, and the decay time is typically one year.\nThe observed peak MIR luminosities ($\\nu L_\\nu$) after subtracting host\ngalaxies are in the range of a few 10^42 to 10^44 erg~s^-1 with a median of\n5x10^43 erg~s^-1 in the W2 band. The black hole masses distribute in a wide\nrange with more than half in between 10^7 to 10^8 ~M_sun, but significantly\ndifferent from that of optical/UV selected TDEs. Furthermore, MIR luminosities\nare correlated with black hole masses, the stellar mass or luminosity of their\nhost bulges. Most galaxies in the sample are red and luminous with an absolute\nmagnitude of r between -20 to -23. We estimate the rate of event about 10^-4\ngal^-1~yr^-1 among luminous red galaxies. We discuss several possibilities for\nthe variable infrared sources, and conclude that most likely, they are caused\nby short sporadic fueling to the supermassive black holes via either the\ninstability of accretion flows or tidal disruption of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 14:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

To\nenable multi-user transmissions, the base-station uses a cell-specific codebook\nof beamforming vectors over an initial beam alignment phase. Each user uses a\nuser-specific codebook of beamforming vectors to learn the top-P (where P >= 1)\nbeam pairs in terms of the observed SNR in a single-user setting. The top-P\nbeam indices along with their SNRs are fed back from each user and the\nbase-station leverages this information to generate beam weights for\nsimultaneous transmissions. A typical method to generate the beam weights is to\nuse only the best beam for each user and either steer energy along this beam,\nor to utilize this information to reduce multi-user interference. The other\nbeams are used as fall back options to address blockage or mobility. Such an\napproach completely discards information learned about the channel condition(s)\neven though each user feeds back this information. With this background, this\nwork develops an advanced directional precoding structure for simultaneous\ntransmissions at the cost of an additional marginal feedback overhead. This\nconstruction relies on three main innovations: 1) Additional feedback to allow\nthe base-station to reconstruct a rank-P approximation of the channel matrix\nbetween it and each user, 2) A zeroforcing structure that leverages this\ninformation to combat multi-user interference by remaining agnostic of the\nreceiver beam knowledge in the precoder design, and 3) A hybrid precoding\narchitecture that allows both amplitude and phase control at low-complexity and\ncost to allow the implementation of the zeroforcing structure. Numerical\nstudies show that the proposed scheme results in a significant sum rate\nperformance improvement over naive schemes even with a coarse initial beam\nalignment codebook.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 15:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

We then\npropose Client Presence Verification (CPV) as a delay-based technique to verify\nan assertion about a client's physical presence in a prescribed geographic\nregion. Three verifiers geographically encapsulating a client's asserted\nlocation are used to corroborate that assertion by measuring the delays between\nthemselves and the client. CPV infers geographic distances from these delays\nand thus, using the smaller of the forward and reverse one-way delay between\neach verifier and the client is expected to result in a more accurate distance\ninference than using the conventional round-trip times. Accordingly, we devise\na novel protocol for accurate one-way delay measurements between the client and\nthe three verifiers to be used by CPV, taking into account that the client\ncould manipulate the measurements to defeat the verification process. We\nevaluate CPV through extensive real-world experiments with legitimate clients\n(those truly present at where they asserted to be) modeled to use both wired\nand wireless access networks.

For wireless\nevaluation, we leverage the Internet delay information collected for wired\nclients from PlanetLab, and model additional delays representing the last-mile\nwireless link.

We show that, for a 40-mode fiber, the electronic signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) is improved asymptotically by almost 6 dB compared to conventional mode\ncombinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 03:02:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 04:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Though\ndeep stacked structures are able to create multi-scale and hierarchical\nrepresentations, manually fixed filter sizes limit the scale of representations\nthat can be learned in a single convolutional layer.\n  This paper introduces a new adaptive filter model that allows variable scale\nand orientation. The scale and orientation parameters of filters can be learned\nusing back propagation. Therefore, in a single convolution layer, we can create\nfilters of different scale and orientation that can adapt to small or large\nfeatures and objects. The proposed model uses a relatively large base size\n(grid) for filters. In the grid, a differentiable function acts as an envelope\nfor the filters. The envelope function guides effective filter scale and\nshape/orientation by masking the filter weights before the convolution.\nTherefore, only the weights in the envelope are updated during training.\n  In this work, we employed a multivariate (2D) Gaussian as the envelope\nfunction and showed that it can grow, shrink, or rotate by updating its\ncovariance matrix during back propagation training . We tested the new filter\nmodel on MNIST, MNIST-cluttered, and CIFAR-10 and compared the results with the\nnetworks that used conventional convolution layers. The results demonstrate\nthat the new model can effectively learn and produce filters of different\nscales and orientations in a single layer. Moreover, the experiments show that\nthe adaptive convolution layers perform equally; or better, especially when\ndata includes objects of varying scale and noisy backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 19:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

The accurate delivery is committed to a dose delivery\n(DD) system that shapes, guides and controls the beam before the patient\nentrance. Most of the early DD systems provided uniform lateral dose profiles\nby using different devices, mainly patient-specific, placed in the beam line to\nshape the three-dimensional final target dose.

Calcium imaging technique is designed to\ndirectly record brain-wide neurons activity in order to discover the underlying\nepileptic mechanism. In this paper, using one brain-wide calcium imaging video\nof Zebrafish, we compute dynamic pattern information of the epileptic\nmechanism, and devise three graphical displays to show the visible functional\naspect of epileptic mechanism over five inter-ictal periods. The foundation of\nour data-driven computations for such dynamic patterns relies on one universal\nphenomenon discovered across 696 informative pixels. This universality is that\neach pixel's progressive 5-percentile process oscillates in an irregular\nfashion at first, but, after the middle point of inter-ictal period, the\noscillation is replaced by a steady increasing trend. Such dynamic patterns are\ncollectively transformed into a visible systemic change-point as an early\nwarning signal (EWS) of an incoming epileptic event. We conclude through the\ngraphic displays that pattern information extracted from the calcium imaging\nvideo realistically reveals the Zebrafish's authentic epileptic mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 01:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}
