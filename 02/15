Quantification of this effect has important applications in space and\nlaboratory plasma, one of which is tracing the electron diffusion region (EDR)\nof magnetic reconnection in space observations. Three different measures of\nagyrotropy of pressure tensor have previously been proposed, namely,\n$A\\varnothing_e$, $D_{ng}$ and $Q$.

Shallow flow models allow capturing the free surface\nof the fluid with little effort and reducing the three-dimensional problem to a\nquasi two-dimensional problem through depth-integrating the flow fields.\nDespite remarkable progress of such models in the last decade, accurate\ndescription of complex topography remains a challenge. Interaction with\ntopography is particularly critical for granular flows, because their rheology\nrequires modeling of the pressure field, which is strongly linked to surface\ncurvature and associated centrifugal forces. Shallow granular flow models are\nusually set up in surface-aligned curvilinear coordinates, and velocity is\nrepresented as a two-dimensional surface-aligned vector field. The\ntransformation from Cartesian to curvilinear coordinates introduces fictitious\nforces, however, which result in complex governing equations. In this paper, we\nset up the shallow flow model in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates and\npreserve three-dimensional velocity in the depth-integrated model. Topography\nis taken into account with a constraint on velocity. This approach is commonly\napplied by the thin liquid film community. The advantage is a curvature-free\nmathematical description that is convenient for complex topographies. The\nconstraint on velocity yields a solution for the pressure field, which is\nrequired for the pressure-dependent rheology of granular materials. The model\nis therefore well-suited for granular flows on three-dimensional terrain, e.g.,\navalanches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 17:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

In scattering theory, there is a general theory for\nshort-range potential scattering, but there is no general theory for long-range\npotential scattering. This is because the scattering boundary conditions for\nall short-range potentials are the same, but for different long-range\npotentials are different. In this paper, by introducing tortoise coordinates,\nwe convert long-range potential scattering to short-range potential scattering.\nThis allows us to deal with long-range potential scattering as short-range\npotential scattering. An explicit expression of the scattering wave function\nfor long-range potential scattering is presented, in which the scattering wave\nfunction is represented by the tortoise coordinate and the scattering phase\nshift. We show that the long-range potential scattering wave function is just\nthe short-range potential scattering wave function with a replacement of a\ncommon coordinate by a tortoise coordinate. The approach applies not only to\nscattering but also applies to bound states. Furthermore, in terms of tortoise\ncoordinates, we suggest a classification scheme for potentials.

The standard approach indirectly optimizes $f$ by\nmaximizing the sum of $f_i$. However, this ignores generalization to the true\n(unknown) distribution.

In some cases, our\nteammates' actions early on can give us a clear idea of what the remainder of\ntheir plan is, i.e. what action sequence we should expect. In others, they\nmight leave us less confident, or even lead us to the wrong conclusion. Our\ngoal is for robot actions to fall in the first category: we want to enable\nrobots to select their actions in such a way that human collaborators can\neasily use them to correctly anticipate what will follow. While previous work\nhas focused on finding initial plans that convey a set goal, here we focus on\nfinding two portions of a plan such that the initial portion conveys the final\none. We introduce $t$-\\ACty{}: a measure that quantifies the accuracy and\nconfidence with which human observers can predict the remaining robot plan from\nthe overall task goal and the observed initial $t$ actions in the plan. We\ncontribute a method for generating $t$-predictable plans: we search for a full\nplan that accomplishes the task, but in which the first $t$ actions make it as\neasy as possible to infer the remaining ones. The result is often different\nfrom the most efficient plan, in which the initial actions might leave a lot of\nambiguity as to how the task will be completed. Through an online experiment\nand an in-person user study with physical robots, we find that our approach\noutperforms a traditional efficiency-based planner in objective and subjective\ncollaboration metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 18:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-15"}

In the case of DM consisting of Weakly-Interacting Massive\nParticles (WIMPs), self-annihilation ultimately produces observable products\nincluding $e^{\\pm}$ pairs and gamma rays. The gamma rays can be detected\ndirectly, while the $e^{\\pm}$ pairs can be detected by radio emission from\nsynchrotron radiation or X-rays and soft gamma rays from inverse Compton\nscattering. An intriguing region to search for astrophysical signs of DM is the\nGalactic center (GC) of the Milky Way, due in part to an observed excess of\ngamma-rays that could be DM. A recent observation by the Fermi-LAT\ncollaboration of a similar excess in the central region of the Andromeda galaxy\n(M31) leads us to explore the possibility of a DM-induced signal there as well.\nWe use the RX-DMFIT tool to perform a multi-frequency analysis of potential DM\nannihilation emissions in M31. We consider WIMP models consistent with the GC\nexcess and calculate the expected emission across the electromagnetic spectrum\nin comparison with available observational data from M31.

Here we analyze a more general type of structural restriction for proofs\nin rule-based proof systems. In this definition, proofs are directed graphs of\nderived formulas in which cycles are allowed as long as every formula is\nderived at least as many times as it is required as a premise. We call such\nproofs \"circular\". We show that, for all sets of standard inference rules with\nsingle or multiple conclusions, circular proofs are sound. We start the study\nof the proof complexity of circular proofs at Circular Resolution, the circular\nversion of Resolution.

Here we find that\nthe first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo\nshow clear evidence for lensing in the plane of observed mass and source\ndistance. The four lowest frequency events follow an apparent locus in this\nplane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the\nmagnification, the generally more distant the source so the wave train is\nstretched more by the Universal expansion, by factors of 2-4. This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be\ndecreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital\nfrequency is used to derive the black hole masses. This lowers the masses to\n5-15 solar masses, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35 solar masses\notherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with\nblack holes orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin\nfor the low frequency events in the far Universe. We also show that the other\ntwo BBH events of higher frequency detected by LIGO/VIRGO, lie well below the\nlensing locus, consistent with being nearby and unlensed. If this apparent\ndivision between local and distant lensed events is reinforced by new\ndetections then the spins and masses of stellar black holes can be compared\nover a timespan of 10 billion years by LIGO/Virgo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 12:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}

The\ngravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain these kicks as consequences of\nasymmetric mass ejection during the supernova (SN) explosion. Support for this\nhydrodynamic explanation is provided by observations of SN remnants with\nassociated NSs, which confirm the prediction that the bulk of the explosion\nejecta, in particular chemical elements between silicon and the iron group, are\ndominantly expelled in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of the NS kick.\nHere, we present a large set of two- and three-dimensional explosion\nsimulations of electron-capture SNe, considering explosion energies between\n~3x10^49 erg and ~1.6x10^50 erg. We find that the fast acceleration of the SN\nshock in the steep density gradient delimiting the O-Ne-Mg core of the\nprogenitor enables such a rapid expansion of neutrino-heated matter that the\ngrowth of neutrino-driven convection freezes out quickly in a high-mode\nspherical harmonics pattern. Since the corresponding momentum asymmetry of the\nejecta is very small and the gravitational acceleration by the fast-expanding\nejecta abates rapidly, the NS kick velocities are at most a few km/s. The\nextremely low core compactness of O-Ne-Mg-core progenitors therefore favors\nhydrodynamic NS kicks much below the ~160 km/s measured for the Crab pulsar.\nThis suggests either that the Crab Nebula is not the remnant of an\nelectron-capture SN, but of a low-mass iron-core progenitor, or that the Crab\npulsar was not accelerated by the gravitational tug-boat mechanism but received\nits kick by a non-hydrodynamic mechanism such as, e.g., anisotropic neutrino\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 10:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

As a concrete example, we implement these equations for\ninspirals of non-spinning (Schwarzschild) binaries. Our code computes inspiral\ntrajectories in milliseconds which is a speed up of 2-5 orders of magnitude\n(depending on the mass-ratio) over previous self-force inspiral models which\ntake minutes to hours to evaluate. Computing two-year duration waveforms using\nour new model we find a mismatch better than $\\sim 10^{-4}$ with respect to\nwaveforms computed using the (slower) full self-force models. The speed of our\nnew approach is comparable with kludge models but has the added benefit of\neasily incorporating self-force results which will, once known, allow the\nwaveform phase to be tracked to sub-radian accuracy over an inspiral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 19:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 21:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

On the\ncontrary, our previous works have demonstrated an example where redundancy can\nbe engineered solely for enhancing other aspects of the system, namely accuracy\nand precision. This design was inspired by the binocular structure of the human\nvision which we believe may share a similar operation. In this paper, we\npresent a unified theory describing how such utilization of redundancy is\nfeasible through two complementary mechanisms: representational redundancy\n(RPR) and entangled redundancy (ETR).

Corporations do not fail instantaneously; objective\nmeasures and rigorous analysis of qualitative (e.g. brand) and quantitative\n(e.g. econometric factors) data can help identify a company's financial risk.\nGathering and storage of data about a corporation has become less difficult\nwith recent advancements in communication and information technologies. The\nremaining challenge lies in mining relevant information about a company's\nhealth hidden under the vast amounts of data, and using it to forecast\ninsolvency so that managers and stakeholders have time to react.

By an explicit calculation the\npossibility for complete screening of the electrostatic reflection self-energy\nof the external source by such polarization effects for $Z \\gg Z_{cr,1}$ is\ndemonstrated. The dependence of the Casimir energy on the screening of the\nCoulomb asymptotics of the external source at some $R_1>R_0$ is also explored\nin detail, and some peculiar effects in the partial channels with the lowest\nrotational numbers $m_j=\\pm 1/2\\, , \\pm3/2$ in the screened case are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 22:08:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 11:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 19:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 16:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

Encoder\nmodels are often determined to optimize performance on training data when the\nreal objective is to generalize well to unseen data. Although there is enough\nnumerical evidence suggesting that noise injection (during training) at the\nrepresentation level might improve the generalization ability of encoders, an\ninformation-theoretic understanding of this principle remains elusive. This\npaper presents a sample-dependent bound on the generalization gap of the\ncross-entropy loss that scales with the information complexity (IC) of the\nrepresentations, meaning the mutual information between inputs and their\nrepresentations. The IC is empirically investigated for standard multi-layer\nneural networks with SGD on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets; the behaviour of the\ngap and the IC appear to be in direct correlation, suggesting that SGD selects\nencoders to implicitly minimize the IC. We specialize the IC to study the role\nof Dropout on the generalization capacity of deep encoders which is shown to be\ndirectly related to the encoder capacity, being a measure of the\ndistinguishability among samples from their representations. Our results\nsupport some recent regularization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 23:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-16"}

An advantage of this process is that different\nconstraints can be applied to each sub-problem if necessary. In addition, the\nresult of this process is that solutions will be sparse in the material domain,\nwhich reduces crossover of signal between material images.

The examples\nare actively selected based on a novel criterion, which jointly estimates the\npotential contribution of an instance on optimizing the feature representation\nas well as improving the classification model for the target task. On one hand,\nthe pre-trained model brings plentiful information from its original task,\navoiding redesign of the network architecture or training from scratch; and on\nthe other hand, the labeling cost can be significantly reduced by active label\nquerying. Experiments on multiple datasets and different pre-trained models\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve cost-effective training of\nDNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 03:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 08:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

To maximize the adaptability, we also propose a new sparse signal\nestimation where the sparse signals, support, noise and signal parameter\nestimation are unified into a variational optimization problem, which can be\neffectively solved with an alternative minimization scheme.

This approach, however,\nquickly falls short as malicious programs become more advanced and adopt the\ncapabilities of obfuscating its binaries to execute the same malicious\nfunctions, making static analysis extremely difficult for newer variants. The\napproach assessed in this paper is a novel dynamic malware analysis method,\nwhich may generalize better than static analysis to newer variants. Inspired by\nrecent successes in Natural Language Processing (NLP), widely used document\nclassification techniques were assessed in detecting malware by doing such\nanalysis on system calls, which contain useful information about the operation\nof a program as requests that the program makes of the kernel. Features\nconsidered are extracted from system call traces of benign and malicious\nprograms, and the task to classify these traces is treated as a binary document\nclassification task of system call traces. The system call traces were\nprocessed to remove the parameters to only leave the system call function\nnames. The features were grouped into various n-grams and weighted with Term\nFrequency-Inverse Document Frequency. This paper shows that Linear Support\nVector Machines (SVM) optimized by Stochastic Gradient Descent and the\ntraditional Coordinate Descent on the Wolfe Dual form of the SVM are effective\nin this approach, achieving a highest of 96% accuracy with 95% recall score.\nAdditional contributions include the identification of significant system call\nsequences that could be avenues for further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 05:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 19:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Most existing graph mining libraries for large graphs either\nresort to sampling or exploit the sparsity structure of such graphs for\nspectral analysis.

We give empirical evidence that\nusing our proposed optimal transport NMF leads to perceptually better results\nthan Euclidean NMF, for both isolated voice reconstruction and BSS tasks.\nFinally, we demonstrate how to use optimal transport for cross domain sound\nprocessing tasks, where frequencies represented in the input spectrograms may\nbe different from one spectrogram to another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Using two large ensembles of\n{\\delta} Sct stars observed by the Kepler Space Telescope, the instrumental\nbiases inherent to Kepler mission data and the statistical properties of these\nstars are investigated. An important focus of this work is an analysis of the\nrelationships between the pulsational and stellar parameters, and their\ndistribution within the classical instability strip. It is found that a\nnon-negligible fraction of main sequence {\\delta} Sct stars exist outside\ntheoretical predictions of the classical instability boundaries, which\nindicates the necessity of a mass-dependent mixing length parameter to\nsimultaneously explain low- and high-radial order pressure modes in {\\delta}\nSct stars within the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

In order to\ndeal with large $d$ and large $N$ (number of samples), most streaming PCA\nalgorithms update the current model using only the incoming sample and then\ndump the information right away to save memory. However the information\ncontained in previously streamed data could be useful. Motivated by this idea,\nwe develop a new streaming PCA algorithm called History PCA that achieves this\ngoal. By using $O(Bd)$ memory with $B\\approx 10$ being the block size, our\nalgorithm converges much faster than existing streaming PCA algorithms. By\nchanging the number of inner iterations, the memory usage can be further\nreduced to $O(d)$ while maintaining a comparable convergence speed. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm along with the rate\nof convergence. We also demonstrate on synthetic and real world data sets that\nour algorithm compares favorably with other state-of-the-art streaming PCA\nmethods in terms of the convergence speed and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 09:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-16"}

The recovery mechanism is believed to be\nmicroscopic diversion of the flow, where injected particles can accumulate in\nnarrow pore throats and clog it, in a process known as a log-jamming effect.\nThe blockage of the narrow pore channels lead to a microscopic diversion of the\nwater flow, causing a redistribution of the local pressure, which again can\nlead to the mobilization of trapped oil, enhancing its recovery.

This is the first general transformation\nbetween the two families of data structures.\n  There is a rich theory of dynamic optimality for BSTs (i.e. the theory of\ncompetitiveness between BST algorithms).

We demonstrate how the engine is able to extract a net\npositive work via its built-in synchronicity using a filter cavity as an\neffective valve, eliminating the need for external control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 11:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 13:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

We relate the\nasymptotic decay and oscillations of $F_n$ with the system's energy spectrum,\nwhich is assumed to be absolutely continuous. In particular $F_n$ is determined\nby the Hamiltonian's measurement spectral density of states (MSDOS) $f(E)$ that\nis closely related to the density of energy states (DOS). We find that $F_n$\ndecays like a power law whose exponent is determined by the power law exponent\n$d_S$ of $f(E)$ around its singularities $E^*$. Our findings are analogous to\nthe classical first passage theory of random walks. In contrast to the\nclassical case, the decay of $F_n$ is accompanied by oscillations with\nfrequencies that are determined by the singularities $E^*$. This gives rise to\ncritical detection periods $\\tau_c$ at which the oscillations disappear. In the\nordinary case $d_S$ can be identified with the spectral dimension found in the\nDOS. Furthermore, the singularities $E^*$ are the van Hove singularities of the\nDOS in this case.

The plates are placed orthogonal to the string and the field\nobeys the Robin boundary conditions on them. The boundary-induced contributions\nare explicitly extracted in the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field\nsquared and energy-momentum tensor for both single and two plates. The VEV of\nthe energy-momentum tensor, in additional to the diagonal components, contains\nan off-diagonal component corresponding to the shear stress.

For points outside the string core the topological contributions in\nthe VEVs are finite on the plates. Near the string the VEVs are dominated by\nthe boundary-free part, whereas at large distances the boundary-induced\ncontributions dominate. Due to the nonzero off-diagonal component of the vacuum\nenergy-momentum tensor, in addition to the normal component, the Casimir forces\nhave nonzero component parallel to the boundary. Unlike the problem on the\nMinkowski bulk, the normal forces acting on the separate plates, in general, do\nnot coincide. Another difference is that in the presence of the cosmic string\nthe Casimir forces for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions differ. For\nDirichlet case the normal Casimir force does not depend on the curvature\ncoupling parameter. This is not the case for other boundary conditions. A new\nqualitative feature induced by the cosmic string is the appearance of the shear\nstress acting on the plates. The corresponding force is directed along the\nradial coordinate and vanishes for Dirichlet and Neumann cases.

In this work, we investigate how a precision measurement of\nthe electron magnetic moment places meaningful constraints on both chameleons\nand symmetrons. Two effects are identified: First, virtual chameleons and\nsymmetrons run in loops to generate quantum corrections to the intrinsic value\nof the magnetic moment; a common process widely considered in the literature\nfor many scenarios beyond the Standard Model. A second effect, however, is\nunique to scalar fields that exhibit screening. A scalar bubblelike profile\nforms inside the experimental vacuum chamber and exerts a fifth force on the\nelectron, leading to a systematic shift in the experimental measurement. In\nquantifying this latter effect, we present a novel approach that combines\nanalytic arguments and a small number of numerical simulations to solve for the\nbubblelike profile quickly for a large range of model parameters. Taken\ntogether, both effects yield interesting constraints in complementary regions\nof parameter space. While the constraints we obtain for the chameleon are\nlargely uncompetitive with those in the existing literature, this still\nrepresents the tightest constraint achievable yet from an experiment not\noriginally designed to search for fifth forces. We break more ground with the\nsymmetron, for which our results exclude a large and previously unexplored\nregion of parameter space.

The latter allows the car to properly\nposition itself within the road lanes, which is also crucial for any subsequent\nlane departure or trajectory planning decision in fully autonomous cars.\nTraditional lane detection methods rely on a combination of highly-specialized,\nhand-crafted features and heuristics, usually followed by post-processing\ntechniques, that are computationally expensive and prone to scalability due to\nroad scene variations. More recent approaches leverage deep learning models,\ntrained for pixel-wise lane segmentation, even when no markings are present in\nthe image due to their big receptive field. Despite their advantages, these\nmethods are limited to detecting a pre-defined, fixed number of lanes, e.g.\nego-lanes, and can not cope with lane changes. In this paper, we go beyond the\naforementioned limitations and propose to cast the lane detection problem as an\ninstance segmentation problem - in which each lane forms its own instance -\nthat can be trained end-to-end. To parametrize the segmented lane instances\nbefore fitting the lane, we further propose to apply a learned perspective\ntransformation, conditioned on the image, in contrast to a fixed \"bird's-eye\nview\" transformation. By doing so, we ensure a lane fitting which is robust\nagainst road plane changes, unlike existing approaches that rely on a fixed,\npre-defined transformation. In summary, we propose a fast lane detection\nalgorithm, running at 50 fps, which can handle a variable number of lanes and\ncope with lane changes. We verify our method on the tuSimple dataset and\nachieve competitive results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-16"}

The QSO is detected with a total of 125 net counts in the full\n($0.5-7$ keV) band and its spectrum can be modeled by a single power-law model\nwith photon index of $\\Gamma = 1.81 \\pm 0.18$ and full band flux of\n$f=3.95\\times 10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$.

Our study has been motivated by the question about the thermodynamical\nsignatures of this paradigmatic quantum critical system and, more generally, by\nthe issue of how quantum criticality accumulates entropy. We find that the\ncrossovers in the phase diagram of temperature and (the non-thermal control\nparameter) transverse field obey a general scaling ansatz, and so does the\ncritical scaling behavior of the specific heat and magnetic expansion\ncoefficient. Furthermore, the Gr\\\"{u}neisen ratio diverges in a power-law way\nwhen the QCP is accessed as a function of the transverse field at zero\ntemperature, which follows the prediction of quantum critical scaling. However,\nat the critical field, upon decreasing the temperature, the Gr\\\"uneisen ratio\napproaches a constant instead of showing the expected divergence.

However, it has been identified that\nscheduled uplink transmission performance in unlicensed spectrum is\nsignificantly degraded due to the double listen-before-talk (LBT) requirements\nat both eNB when sending the uplink grant, and at the scheduled UEs before\ntransmission.

By modeling the dynamics in\ntime of the LBT for both a system that employs a conventional uplink scheme, as\nwell as the proposed scheme, it is verified through analytical evaluation that\nthe double LBT scheme for uplink transmission greatly reduces the channel\naccess probability for the UE, and leads consequently to performance loss,\nwhile the proposed scheme is able to alleviate this issue.

We consider the\ndynamics associated with the attractors at period-doubling accumulation points\nand at tangent bifurcations to describe features of glassy dynamics, critical\nfluctuations and localization transitions. We recall that trajectories\npertaining to the routes to chaos form families of time series that are readily\ntransformed into networks via the Horizontal Visibility algorithm, and this in\nturn facilitates establish connections between entropy and Renormalization\nGroup properties. We discretize the replicator equation of game theory to\nobserve the onset of chaos in familiar social dilemmas, and also to mimic the\nevolution of high-dimensional ecological models. We describe an analytical\nframework of nonlinear mappings that reproduce rank distributions of large\nclasses of data (including Zipf's law). We extend the discussion to point out a\ncommon circumstance of drastic contraction of configuration space driven by the\nattractors of these mappings. We mention the relation of generalized entropy\nexpressions with the dynamics along and at the period doubling, intermittency\nand quasi-periodic routes to chaos. Finally, we refer to additional natural\nphenomena in complex systems where these conditions may manifest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 21:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Experiments on single cavities are in general\nagreement with the predictions of the RCM. It is now desired to test the RCM on\nmore complex structures, such as a cascade or network of coupled cavities, that\nrepresent realistic situations, but which are difficult to test due to the\nlarge size of the structures of interest. This paper presents a novel\nexperimental setup that replaces a cubic-meter-scale microwave cavity with a\nminiaturized cavity, scaled down by a factor of 20 in each dimension, operated\nat a frequency scaled up by a factor of 20 and having wall conductivity\nappropriately scaled up by a factor of 20. We demonstrate experimentally that\nthe miniaturized cavity maintains the statistical wave properties of the larger\ncavity. This scaled setup opens the opportunity to study wave properties in\nlarge structures such as the floor of an office building, a ship, or an\naircraft, in a controlled laboratory setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

For the same purpose, clustering methods are also often used. These\nmethods also introduce a bias, either by starting from the assumption of a\nparticular geometric form of the clusters, or by using iterative schemes to\nenhance cluster contours, with uncontrollable consequences. The goal of data\nanalysis should, however, be to encode and detect structural data features at\nall scales and densities simultaneously, without assuming a parametric form of\ndata point distances, or modifying them. We propose a novel approach that\ndirectly encodes data point neighborhood similarities as a sparse graph. Our\nnon-iterative framework permits a transparent interpretation of data, without\naltering the original data dimension and metric. Several natural and synthetic\ndata applications demonstrate the efficacy of our novel approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 14:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}
