Parameter space reduction and parameter estimation---and, more\ngenerally, understanding the shape of the information contained in models with\nobservational structure---are thus essential for many questions in mathematical\nmodeling and uncertainty quantification. As such, different disciplines have\ndeveloped methods in parallel for approaching the questions in their field.\nMany of these approaches, including identifiability, sloppiness, and active\nsubspaces, use related ideas to address questions of parameter dimension\nreduction, parameter estimation, and robustness of inferences and quantities of\ninterest.\n  In this paper, we show that active subspace methods have intrinsic\nconnections to methods from sensitivity analysis and identifiability, and\nindeed that it is possible to frame each approach in a unified framework. A\nparticular form of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which we denote the\nsensitivity FIM, is fundamental to all three approaches---active subspaces,\nidentifiability, and sloppiness. Through a series of examples and case studies,\nwe illustrate the properties of the sensitivity FIM in several contexts. These\ninitial examples show that the interplay between local and global and linear\nand non-linear strongly impact the insights each approach can generate. These\nobservations underline that one's approach to parameter dimension reduction\nshould be driven by the scientific question and also open the door to using\ntools from the other approaches to generate useful insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 16:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-16"}

Using an infectious disease transmission modeling framework, we\ndemonstrate in both cases that fitness-preserving trade-offs have implications\nfor the dynamics of associated epidemics: less infectious, more persistent\npathogens cause epidemics to progress more slowly than more infectious, less\npersistent (labile) pathogens, even when the overall risk is the same.

Finally, TD-NEGF+LLG as\na nonperturbative (i.e., numerically exact) framework allows us to establish\nthe limits of validity of the so-called spin-motive force (SMF) theory for\npumped charge current by time-dependent magnetic textures---the perturbative\nanalytical formula of SMF theory becomes inapplicable for large frequencies\n(but unrealistic in magnetic system) and, more importantly, for increasing\nnoncollinearity when the angles between neighboring magnetic moments exceed\n$\\simeq 10^\\circ$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 17:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 00:56:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 14:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

When sufficient system details are not known, one typically turns\nto machine learning, which builds a black-box model of the system using a large\ndataset of input sample features and outputs. We consider a setting which is\nbetween these two extremes: some details of the system mechanics are known but\nnot enough for creating simulations that can be used to make high quality\npredictions. In this context we propose using approximate simulations to build\na kernel for use in kernelized machine learning methods, such as support vector\nmachines. The results of multiple simulations (under various uncertainty\nscenarios) are used to compute similarity measures between every pair of\nsamples: sample pairs are given a high similarity score if they behave\nsimilarly under a wide range of simulation parameters. These similarity values,\nrather than the original high dimensional feature data, are used to build the\nkernel.\n  Results: We demonstrate and explore the simulation based kernel (SimKern)\nconcept using four synthetic complex systems--three biologically inspired\nmodels and one network flow optimization model. We show that, when the number\nof training samples is small compared to the number of features, the SimKern\napproach dominates over no-prior-knowledge methods.

In this article, we analyze\nthe tailored coupled-cluster method (TCC), one particular and promising method\nfor treating molecular electronic-structure problems with static correlation.\nThe TCC method combines the single-reference coupled-cluster (CC) approach with\nan approximate reference calculation in a subspace [complete active space\n(CAS)] of the considered Hilbert space that covers the static correlation. A\none-particle spectral gap assumption is introduced, separating the CAS from the\nremaining Hilbert space. This replaces the nonexisting or nearly nonexisting\ngap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied\nmolecular orbital usually encountered in standard single-reference quantum\nchemistry. The analysis covers, in particular, CC methods tailored by\ntensor-network states (TNS-TCC methods). The problem is formulated in a\nnonlinear functional analysis framework, and, under certain conditions such as\nthe aforementioned gap, local uniqueness and existence are proved using\nZarantonello's lemma.

The offset is suggestive of an inhomogeneous\ndust distribution, where 75% of the total star formation activity (SFR$\n\\,\\simeq 70\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}/{\\rm yr}$) of the galaxy is completely obscured.\nOur results provide direct evidence that dust obscuration plays a key role in\nshaping the bright-end of the observed rest-frame UV luminosity function at $z\n\\simeq 7$, in agreement with cosmological galaxy formation simulations. The\nexistence of a heavily-obscured component of galaxy ID65666 indicates that\ndusty star-forming regions, or even entire galaxies, that are \"UV-dark\" are\nsignificant even in the $z \\simeq 7$ galaxy population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 21:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

These\ninstabilities can alter the orbits of gas giants as well as the orbits of\nterrestrial planets and therefore eject or move a habitable planet out of the\nhabitable zone. In this work 423 simulations with 153 different hypothetical\nplanetary systems with gas giants and terrestrial planets have been modelled to\nexplore the orbital stability of habitable planets. The initial parameter\nvariations include the number, distances and masses of the giant planets and\nthe star type. Linear correlations between the initial number and the initial\ndistances of gas giants and the survival rate of habitable planets were found.\nPlanetary systems consisting of two giant planets are fairly benign to\nterrestrial planets, whereas six giant planets very often lead to a complete\nclearing of the habitable zone. Systems with initial distances of five Hill\nRadii between the giant planets have a high chance to harbour a habitable\nplanet, although more compact systems are very destructive. The giant planet\nmasses have a smaller impact on the stability of habitable worlds.\nAdditionally, a link between the present-day orbit of an observed giant\nexoplanet and the survival rate of habitable planets was established. As a rule\nof thumb, observed gas giants with eccentricities higher than 0.4 and\ninclinations higher than 20 degrees have experienced strong planet-planet\nscatterings and are unlikely to have a habitable planet in its system.\nFurthermore, it was found that habitable planets surrounding a K or M-star have\na higher survival rate than those surrounding a G-star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 20:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

For all evolutionary\nchannels based on the evolution of isolated binaries, the immediate progenitor\nof the binary black hole is a close binary system composed of a black hole and\na helium star. We perform detailed binary evolution and systematically explore\nthe parameter space of initial binary properties, including initial black hole\nand helium star masses, initial rotation of the helium star as well as\nmetallicity. We argue that the spin of the first-born black hole at its birth\nis negligible ($\\lesssim 0.1$), hence the second-born black hole's spin\ndominates the measured effective spin, $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$, from gravitational\nwave events of double black hole mergers. We find that tides can be important\nonly when orbital periods are shorter than 2 days. Upon core collapse, the\nhelium star produces a black hole (the second-born black hole in the system)\nwith a spin that can span the entire range from zero to maximally spinning. We\nshow that the bimodal distribution of the spin of the second-born black hole\nobtained in recent papers is mainly due to oversimplifying assumptions. We find\nan anti-correlation between the merging timescale of the two black holes,\nT$_{\\rm merger}$, and the effective spin $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$. Finally, we provide\nnew prescriptions for the tidal coefficient E$_2$ for both H-rich and the\nhelium-rich stars. We predict that, with future improvements to AdLIGO's\nsensitivity, the sample of merging binary black hole systems will show an\noverdensity of sources with positive but small $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$. originating\nfrom lower mass black hole mergers born at low redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 20:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

In these systems, domains of the liquid-condensed phase always\npresent size polydispersity. However, very few theoretical works consider size\ndistribution effects on the monolayer properties. Because of the difference in\nsurface densities, domains have excess dipolar density with respect to the\nsurrounding liquid expanded phase, originating a dipolar inter-domain\ninteraction. This interaction depends on the domain area, and hence the\npresence of a domain size distribution is associated with interaction\npolydispersity. Inter-domain interactions are fundamental to understanding the\nstructure and dynamics of the monolayer. For this reason, it is expected that\npolydispersity significantly alters monolayer properties. By means of Brownian\ndynamics simulations, we study the radial distribution function (RDF), the\naverage mean square displacement and the average time-dependent self-diffusion\ncoefficient, D(t), of lipid monolayers with normal distributed size domains. It\nwas found that polydispersity strongly affects the value of the interaction\nstrength obtained, which is greatly underestimated if polydispersity is not\nconsidered. However, within a certain range of parameters, the RDF obtained\nfrom a polydisperse model can be well approximated by that of a monodisperse\nmodel, suitably fitting the interaction strength, even for 40%\npolydispersities. For small interaction strengths or small polydispersities,\nthe polydisperse systems obtained from fitting the experimental RDF have an\naverage mean square displacement and D(t) in good agreement with that of the\nmonodisperse system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 20:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Taxonomic identification of fossil bovid teeth, however, is\noften imprecise and subjective. Using modern teeth with known taxons, machine\nlearning algorithms can be trained to classify fossils. Previous work by Brophy\net. al. 2014 uses elliptical Fourier analysis of the form (size and shape) of\nthe outline of the occlusal surface of each tooth as features in a linear\ndiscriminant analysis framework. This manuscript expands on that previous work\nby exploring how different machine learning approaches classify the teeth and\ntesting which technique is best for classification. Five different machine\nlearning techniques including linear discriminant analysis, neural networks,\nnuclear penalized multinomial regression, random forests, and support vector\nmachines were used to estimate these models. Support vector machines and random\nforests perform the best in terms of both log-loss and misclassification rate;\nboth of these methods are improvements over linear discriminant analysis. With\nthe identification and application of these superior methods, bovid teeth can\nbe classified with higher accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 22:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

We extend the concept of duality gap (DG), the difference\nbetween the primal and its dual optimal value, into interval linear\nprogramming. We consider two situations: First, DG is zero for every\nrealization of interval parameters (the so called strongly zero DG) and,\nsecond, DG is zero for at least one realization of interval parameters (the so\ncalled weakly zero DG). We characterize strongly and weakly zero DG and its\nspecial case where the matrix of coefficients is real. We discuss computational\ncomplexity of testing weakly and strongly zero DG for commonly used types of\ninterval linear programs and their variants with the real matrix of\ncoefficients.

Lett., 117, 045501 (2016)] to compute the local yield\nstresses at the atomic scale in model two-dimensional Lennard-Jones glasses\nproduced via differing quench protocols. This technique allows us to sample the\nplastic rearrangements in a non-perturbative manner for different loading\ndirections on a well-controlled length scale. Plastic activity upon shearing\ncorrelates strongly with the locations of low yield stresses in the quenched\nstates. This correlation is higher in more structurally relaxed systems. The\ndistribution of local yield stresses is also shown to strongly depend on the\nquench protocol: the more relaxed the glass, the higher the local plastic\nthresholds. Analysis of the magnitude of local plastic relaxations reveals that\nstress drops follow exponential distributions, justifying the hypothesis of an\naverage characteristic amplitude often conjectured in mesoscopic or continuum\nmodels. The amplitude of the local plastic rearrangements increases on average\nwith the yield stress, regardless of the system preparation. The local yield\nstress varies with the shear orientation tested and strongly correlates with\nthe plastic rearrangement locations when the system is sheared correspondingly.\nIt is thus argued that plastic rearrangements are the consequence of shear\ntransformation zones encoded in the glass structure that possess weak slip\nplanes along different orientations. Finally, we justify the length scale\nemployed in this work and extract the yield threshold statistics as a function\nof the size of the probing zones. This method makes it possible to derive\nphysically grounded models of plasticity for amorphous materials by directly\nrevealing the relevant details of the shear transformation zones that mediate\nthis process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 23:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

These applications are demanding, because\nthey require accurate detection of rare anomalies that may be seen only at\nruntime. Such a setting causes supervised methods to perform poorly. We\ndescribe a method for detecting an anomalous face image that meets these\nrequirements. We construct a feature vector that reliably has large entries for\nanomalous images, then use various simple unsupervised methods to score the\nimage based on the feature. Obvious constructions (autoencoder codes;\nautoencoder residuals) are defeated by a 'peeking' behavior in autoencoders.\nOur feature construction removes rectangular patches from the image, predicts\nthe likely content of the patch conditioned on the rest of the image using a\nspecially trained autoencoder, then compares the result to the image. High\nscores suggest that the patch was difficult for an autoencoder to predict, and\nso is likely anomalous. We demonstrate that our method can identify real\nanomalous face images in pools of typical images, taken from celeb-A, that is\nmuch larger than usual in state-of-the-art experiments.

Sensor data fusion is followed by control decisions that adjust the\nflight of a drone by altering motor speeds. If the processing pipeline between\nsensor input and actuation is not bounded, the drone will lose control and\npossibly fail to maintain flight.\n  Motivated by the implementation of a multithreaded drone flight controller on\nthe Quest RTOS, we develop a composable pipe model based on the system's task,\nscheduling and communication abstractions.

In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient distributed stochastic optimization method\nby combining adaptivity with variance reduction techniques. Our analysis yields\na linear speedup in the number of machines, constant memory footprint, and only\na logarithmic number of communication rounds. Critically, our approach is a\nblack-box reduction that parallelizes any serial online learning algorithm,\nstreamlining prior analysis and allowing us to leverage the significant\nprogress that has been made in designing adaptive algorithms. In particular, we\nachieve optimal convergence rates without any prior knowledge of smoothness\nparameters, yielding a more robust algorithm that reduces the need for\nhyperparameter tuning. We implement our algorithm in the Spark distributed\nframework and exhibit dramatic performance gains on large-scale logistic\nregression problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 00:47:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 21:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 01:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Recent superpixel methods have been designed to fit boundary\nadherence, usually regulating the size and shape of each superpixel in order to\nmitigate the occurrence of undersegmentation failures. Superpixel regularity\nand compactness sometimes imposes an excessive number of segments in the image,\nwhich ultimately decreases the efficiency of the final segmentation, specially\nin video segmentation.

The\naccelerated expansion can be modelled by invoking a cosmological constant or a\ndynamical model of dark energy. A key difference between these models is that\nthe equation of state parameter $w$ for dark energy differs from $-1$ in\ndynamical dark energy (DDE) models. Further, the equation of state parameter is\nnot constant for a general DDE model. Such differences can be probed using the\nvariation of scale factor with time by measuring distances. Another significant\ndifference between the cosmological constant and DDE models is that the latter\nmust cluster. Linear perturbation analysis indicates that perturbations in\nquintessence models of dark energy do not grow to have a significant amplitude\nat small length scales. In this paper we study the response of quintessence\ndark energy to non-linear perturbations in dark matter. We use a fully\nrelativistic model for spherically symmetric perturbations. In this study we\nfocus on thawing models. We find that in response to non-linear perturbations\nin dark matter, dark energy perturbations grow at a faster rate than expected\nin linear perturbation theory. We find that dark energy perturbation remains\nlocalised and does not diffuse out to larger scales. The dominant drivers of\nthe evolution of dark energy perturbations are the local Hubble flow and a\nsupression of gradients of the scalar field. We also find that the equation of\nstate parameter $w$ changes in response to perturbations in dark matter such\nthat it also becomes a function of position. The variation of $w$ in space is\ncorrelated with density contrast for matter. Variation of $w$ and perturbations\nin dark energy are more pronounced in response to large scale perturbations in\nmatter while the dependence on the amplitude of matter perturbations is much\nweaker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 05:30:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 10:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 09:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 05:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

The phase\nseparated melt can successfully be exploited to control the morphology of the\nfinal semi crystalline materials by allowing an extended thermal annealing.\nThermal annealing accelerates coalescence of microdomains, yielding a phase\nseparated melt that would exhibit a distinctly different crystallization\nbehaviour than microphase separated melt without annealing. In this paper, we\nreport simulation results on the crystallization behavior of A-B diblock\ncopolymer, wherein the melting temperature of A-block is higher than B-block,\ninstigated from microphase separated melt. During crystallization, the\nmorphological evolution of microphase separated melt is extensively driven by\nthermal history. Annealing of microphase separated melt at high temperature\nsuccessfully reorients melt morphology, and remains almost unaltered during the\nsubsequent crystallization (isothermal and non-isothermal), which is attributed\nto the hard confinement resulted during microphase separation. Annealing\ninduces a change in bond orientation of A-block, whereas there is no\nappreciable change in bond orientation of B-block keeping crystallinity and\nlamellar thickness unaffected. Isothermal crystallization confines\ncrystallization in phase separated microdomain whereas non-isothermal\ncrystallization results in morphological perturbation. The crystallization rate\nof annealed melt is much faster than the non-annealed melt due to less\nentanglement and more relaxed structure, achieved via annealing. At a higher\ncomposition of B-block, A-block produces thicker crystals, which is attributed\nto the dilution effect exhibited by B-block.

We also show that given a Lie algebra one can construct the\n$n$-ary Lie bracket by means of an (n-2)-cochain of given Lie algebra and find\nthe conditions under which this n-ary bracket satisfies the Filippov-Jacobi\nidentity, thereby inducing the structure of n-Lie algebra. We extend this\napproach to n-Lie superalgebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 09:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

Due to vast file sizes and associated\nbitrates, it is desirable to compress raw high bit-depth 4:4:4 HD video\nsequences as much as possible without incurring a discernible decrease in\nvisual quality. In this paper, we propose a Coding Block (CB)-level perceptual\nvideo coding technique for HEVC named Full Color Perceptual Quantization\n(FCPQ). FCPQ is designed to adjust the Quantization Parameter (QP) at the CB\nlevel (i.e., the luma CB and the chroma Cb and Cr CBs) according to the\nvariances of pixel data in each CB. FCPQ is based on the default perceptual\nquantization method in HEVC called AdaptiveQP. AdaptiveQP adjusts the QP of an\nentire CU based only on the spatial activity of the constituent luma CB. As\ndemonstrated in this paper, by not accounting for the spatial activity of the\nconstituent chroma CBs, as is the case with AdaptiveQP, coding performance can\nbe significantly affected; this is because the variance of pixel data in a luma\nCB is notably different from the variances of pixel data in chroma Cb and Cr\nCBs. FCPQ, therefore, addresses this problem. In terms of coding performance,\nFCPQ achieves BD-Rate improvements of up to 39.5% (Y), 16% (Cb) and 29.9% (Cr)\ncompared with AdaptiveQP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 10:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

For continuous-valued data, Shimizu et al. have proposed a linear\nacyclic non-Gaussian model to understand the data generating process, and have\nshown that their model is identifiable when the number of data is sufficiently\nlarge. However, situations in which continuous and discrete variables coexist\nin the same problem are common in practice. Most existing causal discovery\nmethods either ignore the discrete data and apply a continuous-valued algorithm\nor discretize all the continuous data and then apply a discrete Bayesian\nnetwork approach. These methods possibly loss important information when we\nignore discrete data or introduce the approximation error due to\ndiscretization. In this paper, we define a novel hybrid causal model which\nconsists of both continuous and discrete variables. The model assumes: (1) the\nvalue of a continuous variable is a linear function of its parent variables\nplus a non-Gaussian noise, and (2) each discrete variable is a logistic\nvariable whose distribution parameters depend on the values of its parent\nvariables. In addition, we derive the BIC scoring function for model selection.\nThe new discovery algorithm can learn causal structures from mixed continuous\nand discrete data without discretization. We empirically demonstrate the power\nof our method through thorough simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 10:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

We propose a\nconvolutional network regression method to quantify the extent of EPVS in the\nbasal ganglia from 3D brain MRI. We first segment the basal ganglia and\nsubsequently apply a 3D convolutional regression network designed for small\nobject detection within this region of interest. The network takes an image as\ninput, and outputs a quantification score of EPVS. The network has\nsignificantly more convolution operations than pooling ones and no final\nactivation, allowing it to span the space of real numbers. We validated our\napproach using a dataset of 2000 brain MRI scans scored visually. Experiments\nwith varying sizes of training and test sets showed that a good performance can\nbe achieved with a training set of only 200 scans. With a training set of 1000\nscans, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between our scoring method\nand the expert's visual score was 0.74. Our method outperforms by a large\nmargin - more than 0.10 - four more conventional automated approaches based on\nintensities, scale-invariant feature transform, and random forest. We show that\nthe network learns the structures of interest and investigate the influence of\nhyper-parameters on the performance. We also evaluate the reproducibility of\nour network using a set of 60 subjects scanned twice (scan-rescan\nreproducibility). On this set our network achieves an ICC of 0.93, while the\nintrarater agreement reaches 0.80. Furthermore, the automatic EPVS scoring\ncorrelates similarly to age as visual scoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 12:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 22:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

This work proposes the use of cross-validation\ntechniques to assess the goodness of fit of spatial models in different regions\nof the spatial domain to account for uncertainty in the choice of the\nvalidation sets. An obvious problem with the basic cross-validation scheme is\nthat it is based on selecting only a few out of sample locations to validate\nthe model, possibily making the conclusions sensitive to which partition of the\ndata into training and validation cases is utilized. A possible solution to\nthis issue would be to consider all possible configurations of data divided\ninto training and validation observations. From a Bayesian point of view, this\ncould be computationally demanding, as estimation of parameters usually\nrequires Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. To deal with this problem, we\npropose the use of estimated discrepancy functions considering all\nconfigurations of data partition in a computationally efficient manner based on\nsampling importance resampling. In particular, we consider uncertainty in the\nlocations by assigning a prior distribution to them. Furthermore, we propose a\nstratified cross-validation scheme to take into account spatial heterogeneity,\nreducing the total variance of estimated predictive discrepancy measures\nconsidered for model assessment. We illustrate the advantages of our proposal\nwith simulated examples of homogeneous and inhomogeneous spatial processes to\ninvestigate the effects of our proposal in scenarios of preferential sampling\ndesigns.

Clearly money is one of the most important mediums through\nwhich different types of actors can support and steer scientists to work on\nundone topics. Yet which actors are more visible in their support for\nscientific research is something which has seldom been measured. This study\ndelves into research funding in the context of rare diseases research, a topic\nwhich has evolved from the margins of medical research into a priority area\narticulated by many contemporary funding agencies. Rare diseases refer to\nconditions affecting relatively few people in a population. Given low\nincidences, interest groups have articulated a lack of attention within medical\nresearch compared to more common conditions. The rise to prominence of rare\ndiseases in research funding policies is often explained in the science studies\nliterature in terms of effective lobbying by social movements Likewise,\ninnovative fundraising initiatives, infrastructure building, and close\npartnerships with research groups are other means through which interested\nactors have sought to build capacity for research into rare medical conditions.\nTo date however systematic empirical evidence to compare the relative\nimportance of different actors in funding rare disease research has not been\nproduced. Building on interest in undone science in STS and science policy\nstudies, our study hopes to map-out different kinds of funding actors and their\ninfluence on leading scientific research on rare diseases, by use of\nbibliometric tools.

Having detected the Griffiths\nphase via derivative of LE in equilibrium, we show that in the non-equilibrium\nsituation, the spin chain requires a temporal window to realize the effect of\ndisorder. We show that within this timescale, LE falls off exponentially and\nthis decay is maximally controlled by the initial states and coupling strength.\nOur detail investigation suggests that there actually exist three types of\nexponential decay, a Gaussian decay in ultra short time scale followed by two\nexponential decay in the intermediate time with two different decay exponents.\nThe effect of the disorder starts appearing in the late time power law fall of\nLE where the power law exponent is strongly dependent on disorder strength and\nthe final state but almost independent of initial states and coupling strength.\nThis feature allows us to indicate the presence of Griffiths phase. To be\nprecise, continuously varying critical exponent and wide distribution of\nrelaxation time imprint their effect in LE in the late time limit where the\npower law fall is absent for quenching to a Griffiths phase. Here, LE vanishes\nfollowing the fast exponential fall. Interestingly, for off-critical quenching\nLE attains a higher saturation value for increasing disorder strength,\notherwise vanishes for a clean spin chain, referring to the fact that disorder\nprohibits the rapid decay of entanglement in long time limit. Moreover, we show\nthat disorder is also able to destroy the light cone like nature of post quench\nquasi-particles as LE does not sense the singular time scales appearing for\nclean spin chain with qubits coupled at symmetric positions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 14:40:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 09:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

In this setting, it thus becomes necessary to compute\na random domain mapping on the whole domain, such that the domain mapping is\nthe identity on the fixed subdomain and maps the boundary of the chosen fixed,\nnominal domain on to the random boundary.\n  To overcome the necessity of computing such a mapping, we therefore couple\nthe finite element method on the fixed subdomain with the boundary element\nmethod on the random boundary.

By further making\nsuperpositions of the degenerate ground states with zero or unidirectional spin\ncurrents, we show that different patterns of spatial charge and spin\nmodulations will emerge. Such anomaly persists for the odd numbers of holes,\nbut the spin current, ground state degeneracy, and charge/spin modulations\ncompletely disappear for even numbers of holes, with the two-hole ground state\nexhibiting a d-wave symmetry. An understanding of the spin current due to a\nmany-body Berry-like phase and its impact on the momentum distribution of the\ndoped holes will be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 15:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 12:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}

The novelty\nis that rainfall is taken into account in the tree and grass growth functions\nand in the biomass carrying capacities.

This approach enables\nto move certain development tasks from road or test rigs and HiL (Hardware in\nthe loop) to PCs, where they can often be performed faster and cheaper. Renault\nhas recently established such a virtualization process for powertrain control\nsoftware based on Simulink models. If the number of runnables exceeds a\nthreshold (about 1500) the execution of the virtual ECU is no longer straight\nforward and specific techniques are required. This paper describes the\nmotivation behind a Simulink model based process, the virtualization process\nand applications of the resulting virtual ECUs. Domain: Critical Transportation\nSystems Topic: Processes, methods and tools, in particular: virtual engineering\nand simulation 1. Motivation Since 2010, Renault has established a framework to\ndevelop engine control software for Diesel and Gasoline engines [6]. The\nframework is heavily based on MATLAB/Simulink and the idea of model-based\ndevelopment, which facilitates the carry-over and carry-across of application\nsoftware between software projects. In the Renault EMS architecture software is\ncomposed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. A\nfunction consists of modules. A module is the smallest testable software unit\nand contains runnables to be scheduled and executed by the Operating System\n(Os) of the ECU. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the\nfollowing steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules\nper ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. Generation of C code (EMS application\nsoftware) from all module specifications using MATLAB/Simulink Embedded Coder.\n3. MiL (Model in the Loop) test and validation of the resulting executable\nspecifications at module level in a simulated system environment, considering\nonly essential interactions with other modules and system environment. This is\nessentially a back-to-back test to make sure that the Simulink model of a\nmodule and the corresponding production C code show equivalent and intended\nbehaviour. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with\nsteps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4.\nConfiguration of modules to fit to the specific needs of a software project,\nsuch as absence or presence of certain components. 5. Integration of generated\nconfigured C code and hand-coded platform software (basic software) on supplied\ntarget hardware, a real ECU that communicates with other controllers via CAN\nand other busses. 6. Validation and test of all modules on system level using\nthe real ECU. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and\ninteractions with the system environment are visible then and subject to\ntesting. For example, the Os runs all scheduled runnables then, not just those\nof the modules considered to be 'essential' for a module under test. Critical\nassessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay\nbetween delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at\nthe end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire\nsoftware (step 6). Typical delays are weeks or months.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 15:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

In the second section, the report discusses how Small Modular\nReactors (SMRs) might address these issues. Megaprojects are extremely risky\nand often implemented after a sub-optimal phase of project planning leading to\nunderestimations of the costs and overestimation of short-term benefits. When\nconsidering adherence to schedule and budget, often megaprojects might be\nconsidered a failure, and optimism bias, strategic mis-rapresentation,\ncomplexity, poor planning, poor risk allocation, poor scope management are all\nreasons to explain their over budget and delay. For megaprojects, especially in\nthe nuclear field, a key strategy to achieve good performances appears to be\nthe standardization. This standardization needs to be twofold: (i) technical\nstandardisation, i.e. the construction of very similar design over and over,\nand (ii) the project delivery chain standardisation, i.e. the same stakeholders\ninvolved in the delivery of a project that is replicable multiple times. Under\nthis perspective, given their size and standardisation potential, SMRs, might\nbe a suitable class of NPP for several countries. Yet, if the economy of scale\nis the only driver considered, SMRs are hardly competitive with large NPPs (or\neven with gas or coal power plants). However, a fleet of standard SMRs might\nbalance the lack of economy of scale with the economy of multiples, and the\ndelivery of several standardised SMR projects might be the key to achieve good\nproject management performances in the nuclear sector. However, the deployment\nof SMRs faces a number of challenges from several perspectives, such as the\nlicencing, supply chain and financing ones.
