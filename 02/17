The measured output is the\nquantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state.\nFirst we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings\nwith binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis\nstate corresponding to a sample string.

It is proved that every simple $A$-module\nhas dimension $\\le n$ and that \"almost all\" have dimension precisely $n$. There\nare enough finite dimensional simple modules to separate elements of $A$; that\nis, if $0\\ne a \\in A$, then there exists a simple module $S$ such that $a.S \\ne\n0.$ Consequently $A$ satisfies a polynomial identity of degree $2n$ (and none\nof lower degree).

Genes in extant species were\ngained at different historical times via de novo creation of new genes,\nduplication of existing genes or transfer from genes of another species (HGT),\nand get lost gradually. With the increasing number of sequenced genomes, some\ncomparative analyses have been done to quantify the evolutionary history of\ngene gains and losses in restricted lineages like vertebrates, insects, fungi,\nplants and so on. Here, we have constructed and analyzed over 10,000 gene\nfamily trees to reconstruct the gene content of ancestral genomes at an\nunprecedented scale, covering hundreds of genomes across all domains of life.\nThis is the most comprehensive genome-wide analysis of all events in gene\nevolutionary histories.

Dyer and Greenhill proved a dichotomy stating that the tractability of\nnon-modular counting graph homomorphisms depends on the structure of the input\ngraph. Many intractable cases in non-modular counting become tractable in\nmodular counting due to the common phenomenon of cancellation. However, in\nsubsequent studies on counting modulo $2$ the influence, the structure of $H$\nhas on the tractability, was shown to persist, yielding similar dichotomies.\n  Our main result shows that for every tree $H$ and every prime $p$ the problem\n$\\#_p\\mathsf{H}$OMS$\\mathsf{T}$O$H$ is either polynomial time computable or\n$\\#_p\\mathsf{P}$-complete.

Existing\nattempts at addressing the problem of complex scene understanding lack\nrepresentational power, efficiency, and the ability to create robust\nmeta-knowledge about scenes. In this paper, we introduce scenarios as a new way\nof representing scenes. The scenario is a simple, low-dimensional, data-driven\nrepresentation consisting of sets of frequently co-occurring objects and is\nuseful for a wide range of scene understanding tasks. We learn scenarios from\ndata using a novel matrix factorization method which we integrate into a new\nneural network architecture, the ScenarioNet.

In addition to solving many tasks in a single,\nunified framework, ScenarioNet is more computationally efficient than other\nCNNs because it requires significantly fewer parameters while achieving similar\nperformance on benchmark tasks and is more interpretable because it produces\nexplanations when making decisions.

Static balance points correspond to the\ncritical points of the particle's surface represented as a scalar distance\nfunction $r$, measured from the center of mass, so their time evolution can be\nexpressed as $N(r(t))$. The mathematical model of the particle can be\nconstructed on two scales: on the macro scale the particle may be viewed as a\nsmooth, convex manifold described by the smooth distance function $r$ with\n$N=N(r)$ equilibria, while on the micro scale the particle's natural model is a\nfinely discretized, convex polyhedral approximation $r^{\\Delta}$ of $r$, with\n$N^{\\Delta}=N(r^{\\Delta})$ equilibria. There is strong intuitive evidence\nsuggesting that under some particular evolution models $N(t)$ and\n$N^{\\Delta}(t)$ primarily evolve in the opposite manner. Here we create the\nmathematical framework necessary to understand these phenomenon more broadly,\nregardless of the particular evolution equation. We study micro and macro\nevents in one-parameter families of curves and surfaces, corresponding to\nbifurcations triggering the jumps in $N(t)$ and $N^{\\Delta}(t)$. We show that\nthe intuitive picture developed for curvature-driven flows is not only correct,\nit has universal validity, as long as the evolving surface $r$ is smooth. In\nthis case, bifurcations associated with $r$ and $r^{\\Delta}$ are coupled to\nsome extent: resonance-like phenomena in $N^{\\Delta}(t)$ can be used to\nforecast downward jumps in $N(t)$ (but not upward jumps). Beyond proving\nrigorous results for the $\\Delta \\to 0$ limit on the nontrivial interplay\nbetween singularities in the discrete and continuum approximations we also show\nthat our mathematical model is structurally stable, i.e. it may be verified by\ncomputer simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 20:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

The complex interactions between the solid, liquid, and\nvapor phases can lead to rich dynamics even in a single Leidenfrost drop. Here\nwe investigate the self-organized oscillations of Leidenfrost drops that are\nexcited by a constant flow of evaporated vapor beneath the drop. We show that\nfor small Leidenfrost drops, the frequency of a recently reported \"breathing\nmode\" can be explained by a simple balance of gravitational and surface tension\nforces. For large Leidenfrost drops, azimuthal star-shaped oscillations are\nobserved. Our previous work showed how the coupling between the rapid\nevaporated vapor flow and the vapor-liquid interface excites the star\noscillations (Ma \\textit{et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids}, 2, 2017, 031602). In our\nexperiments, star-shaped oscillation modes of $n=2$ to 13 are observed in\ndifferent liquids, the number of observed modes depends sensitively on the\nliquid viscosity. Here we expand on this work by directly comparing the\noscillations with theoretical predictions, and show how the oscillations are\ninitiated by a parametric forcing mechanism through pressure oscillations in\nthe vapor layer. The pressure oscillations are driven by the capillary waves of\na characteristic wavelength beneath the drop. These capillary waves can be\ngenerated by a large shear stress at the liquid-vapor interface due to the\nrapid flow of evaporated vapor. We also explore potential effects of thermal\nconvection in the liquid. Although the measured Rayleigh number is\nsignificantly larger than the critical value, the frequency (wavelength) of the\noscillations depends only on the capillary length of the liquid, and is\nindependent of the drop radius and substrate temperature. Thus convection seems\nto play a minor role in Leidenfrost drop oscillations, which are mostly\nhydrodynamic in origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 21:50:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 21:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Nevertheless, communication at these\nfrequencies requires narrow beams via massive MIMO and beamforming to overcome\nthe strong signal attenuation, and thus precise beam-alignment between\ntransmitter and receiver is needed. The resulting signaling overhead may become\na severe impairment, especially in mobile networks with high users density.\nTherefore, it is imperative to optimize the beam-alignment protocol to minimize\nthe signaling overhead. In this paper, the design of energy efficient joint\nbeam-alignment protocols for two users is addressed, with the goal to minimize\nthe power consumption during data transmission, subject to rate constraints for\nboth users, under analog beamforming constraints. It is proved that a bisection\nsearch algorithm is optimal. Additionally, the optimal scheduling strategy of\nthe two users in the data communication phase is optimized based on the outcome\nof beam-alignment, according to a time division multiplexing scheme. The\nnumerical results show significant decrease in the power consumption for the\nproposed joint beam-alignment scheme compared to exhaustive search and a\nsingle-user beam-alignment scheme taking place separately for each user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 22:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

The irradiation-induced suppression of the film $T_c$ is\nsignificantly smaller than on a similarly damaged single crystal. Moreover\n$H_{c2}$ behaves differently, depending on the field orientation: for H//c the\n$H_{c2}$ slope monotonically increases with increasing disorder, whereas for\nH//ab it remains constant at low dose and it increases only when the sample is\nhighly disordered. This suggests that a much higher damage level is necessary\nto drive the NdFeAs(O,F) thin film into the dirty limit.

We then demonstrate how\nthis discriminant can be used in conjunction with the charge-to-light\ndiscrimination to possibly improve the signal-to-noise ratio for nuclear\nrecoils.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 00:05:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 17:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

We present a method using transfer entropy to extract this flow of\ninformation between brain regions from spike-train data commonly obtained in\nneurological experiments. Transfer entropy is a statistical measure based in\ninformation theory that attempts to quantify the information flow from one\nprocess to another, and has been applied to find connectivity in simulated\nspike-train data. Due to statistical error in the estimator, inferring\nfunctional connectivity requires a method for determining significance in the\ntransfer entropy values. We discuss the issues with numerical estimation of\ntransfer entropy and resulting challenges in determining significance before\npresenting the trial-shuffle method as a viable option. The trial-shuffle\nmethod, for spike-train data that is split into multiple trials, determines\nsignificant transfer entropy values independently for each individual pair of\nneurons by comparing to a created baseline distribution using a rigorous\nstatistical test. This is in contrast to either globally comparing all neuron\ntransfer entropy values or comparing pairwise values to a single baseline\nvalue.\n  In establishing the viability of this method by comparison to several\nalternative approaches in the literature, we find evidence that preserving the\ninter-spike-interval timing is important.\n  We then use the trial-shuffle method to investigate information flow within a\nmodel network as we vary model parameters. This includes investigating the\nglobal flow of information within a connectivity network divided into two\nwell-connected subnetworks, going beyond local transfer of information between\npairs of neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 00:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 02:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

Furthermore, guidelines for early\ndiagnosis and treatment of lung cancer are consist of different shape and\nvolume measurements of abnormalities. Segmentation is at the heart of our\nunderstanding of nodules morphology making it a major area of interest within\nthe field of computer aided diagnosis systems. This study set out to test the\nhypothesis that joint learning of false positive (FP) nodule reduction and\nnodule segmentation can improve the computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems'\nperformance on both tasks. To support this hypothesis we propose a 3D deep\nmulti-task CNN to tackle these two problems jointly.

Contrast analysis serves as a keystone in various fields and has\ndemonstrated its effectiveness in mining valuable information. However, it has\nbeen long overlooked in graph pattern mining. Therefore, in this paper, we\nintroduce the concept of contrast subgraph, that is, a subset of nodes that\nhave significantly different edges or edge weights in two given graphs of the\nsame node set. The major challenge comes from the gap between the contrast and\nthe informativeness. Because of the widely existing noise edges in real-world\ngraphs, the contrast may lead to subgraphs of pure noise. To avoid such\nmeaningless subgraphs, we leverage the similarity as the cornerstone of the\ncontrast. Specifically, we first identify a coherent core, which is a small\nsubset of nodes with similar edge structures in the two graphs, and then induce\ncontrast subgraphs from the coherent cores. Moreover, we design a general\nfamily of coherence and contrast metrics and derive a polynomial-time algorithm\nto efficiently extract contrast subgraphs. Extensive experiments verify the\nnecessity of introducing coherent cores as well as the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our algorithm. Real-world applications demonstrate the tremendous\npotentials of contrast subgraph mining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 04:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

The positioning\ndrift can be reduced with regular loop-closures and global relaxation as the\nbackend, thus achieving a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\nAlthough vision-based systems like laser scanners are typically deployed for\nSLAM, these sensors are heavy, energy inefficient, and expensive, making them\nunattractive for wearables or smartphone applications. However, the concept of\nSLAM can be extended to non-optical systems such as magnetometers. Instead of\nmatching features such as walls and furniture using some variation of the ICP\nalgorithm, the local magnetic field can be matched to provide loop-closure and\nglobal trajectory updates in a Gaussian Process (GP) SLAM framework. With a\nMEMS-based inertial measurement unit providing a continuous trajectory, and the\nmatching of locally distinct magnetic field maps, experimental results in this\npaper show that a drift-free navigation solution in an indoor environment with\nmillimetre-level accuracy can be achieved. The GP-SLAM approach presented can\nbe formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem and it can naturally\nperform loop-detection, feature-to-feature distance minimization, global\ntrajectory optimization, and magnetic field map estimation simultaneously.\nSpatially continuous features (i.e. smooth magnetic field signatures) are used\ninstead of discrete feature correspondences (e.g. point-to-point) as in\nconventional vision-based SLAM. These position updates from the ambient\nmagnetic field also provide enough information for calibrating the\naccelerometer and gyroscope bias in-use. The only restriction for this method\nis the need for magnetic disturbances (which is typically not an issue\nindoors); however, no assumptions are required for the general motion of the\nsensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 07:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

Dynamic checks in the nucleus\nguarantee that no invalid object-level derivations can be constructed. %even if\nthe AML code (or interpreter) is untrusted.\n  To demonstrate the flexibility of this system structure, we implemented a\nnucleus consisting of dependent type theory with equality reflection. Equality\nreflection provides a very high level of expressiveness, as it allows the user\nto add new judgmental equalities, but it also destroys desirable meta-theoretic\nproperties of type theory (such as decidability and strong normalization).\n  The power of effects and handlers in AML is demonstrated by a standard\nlibrary that provides default algorithms for equality checking, computation of\nnormal forms, and implicit argument filling. Users can extend these new\nalgorithms by providing local \"hints\" or by completely replacing these\nalgorithms for particular developments. We demonstrate the resulting system by\nshowing how to axiomatize and compute with natural numbers, by axiomatizing the\nuntyped $\\lambda$-calculus, and by implementing a simple automated system for\nmanaging a universe of types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 10:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

The oil is\nmodelled by the Carreau-Yasuda (CY) and Phan-Thien \\& Tanner (PTT) constitutive\nequations. Both models account for shear-thinning but only the PTT model\naccounts for elasticity. The CY and other generalised Newtonian models have\nbeen previously used in theoretical studies of fluid dampers, but the present\nstudy is the first to perform full two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations\nemploying a viscoelastic constitutive equation. It is found that the CY and PTT\npredictions are similar when the excitation frequency is low, but at medium and\nhigher frequencies the CY model fails to describe important phenomena that are\npredicted by the PTT model and observed in experimental studies found in the\nliterature, such as the hysteresis of the force-displacement and force-velocity\nloops. Elastic effects are quantified by applying a decomposition of the damper\nforce into elastic and viscous components, inspired from LAOS (Large Amplitude\nOscillatory Shear) theory. The CY model also overestimates the damper force\nrelative to the PTT, because it underpredicts the flow development length\ninside the piston-cylinder gap. It is thus concluded that (a) fluid elasticity\nmust be accounted for and (b) theoretical approaches that rely on the\nassumption of one-dimensional flow in the piston-cylinder gap are of limited\naccuracy, even if they account for fluid viscoelasticity. The consequences of\nusing lower-viscosity silicone oil are also briefly examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 10:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

Experimental verification of these predictions is still\ncontroversial for conventional spin glasses. We show that multiferroic spin\nglass systems can provide a unique platform for verifying these theoretical\npredictions via a study of change in magnetoelastic and magnetoelectric\ncouplings, obtained from an analysis of diffraction data, at the spin glass\ntransition temperatures. Results of macroscopic and microscopic (x-ray and\nneutron scattering) measurements are presented on disordered BiFeO3, a\ncanonical Heisenberg system with small single ion anisotropy, which reveal\nappearance of two spin glass phases SG1 and SG2 in coexistence with the LRO\nphase below the A-T and G-T lines. It is shown that the temperature dependence\nof the integrated intensity of the antiferromagnetic peak shows dips with\nrespect to the Brillouin function behaviour around the SG1 and SG2 transition\ntemperatures. The ferroelectric polarisation changes significantly at the two\nspin glass transition temperatures. These results, obtained using microscopic\ntechniques, clearly demonstrate that the SG1 and SG2 transitions occur on the\nsame magnetic sublattice and are intrinsic to the system. We also construct a\nphase diagram showing all the magnetic phases in BF-xBT system. While our\nresults on the two spin glass transitions support the theoretical predictions,\nit also raises several open questions which need to be addressed by revisiting\nthe existing theories of spin glass transitions by taking into account the\neffect of magnetoelastic and magnetoelectric couplings as well as\nelectromagnons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 13:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

From the beginning of their observation, the\nquestion of whether the components of these pairs are the first and the second\nharmonics of radio emission or not has remained open. We discuss properties of\ndecameter IIIb-III pairs in detail to answer this question. The components of\nthese pairs, Type IIIb bursts and Type III bursts, have essentially different\ndurations and polarizations. At the same time their frequency drift rates are\nrather close, provided that the drift rates of Type IIIb bursts are a little\nlarger those of Type III bursts at the same frequency. Frequency ratios of the\nbursts at the same moment are close to two. This points at a harmonic\nconnection of the components in IIIb-III pairs. At the same time there was a\nserious difficulty, namely why the first harmonic had fine frequency structure\nin the form of striae and the second harmonic did not have it. Recently Loi,\nCairns, and Li ( Astrophys. J. 790, 67, 2014) succeeded in solving this\nproblem. The physical aspects of observational properties of decameter IIIb-III\npairs are discussed and pros and cons of harmonic character of Type IIIb bursts\nand Type III bursts in IIIb-III pairs are presented.

We find\nthat $f_{\\rm sed}$ is dependent on $K_{zz}$, but not gravity, when $K_{zz}$ is\nheld constant. $f_{\\rm sed}$ is most sensitive to the nucleation rate of cloud\nparticles, as determined by material properties like surface energy and\nmolecular weight. High surface energy materials form fewer, larger cloud\nparticles, leading to large $f_{\\rm sed}$ ($>$1), and vice versa for materials\nwith low surface energy. For cloud formation via heterogeneous nucleation,\n$f_{\\rm sed}$ is sensitive to the condensation nuclei flux and radius,\nconnecting cloud formation in substellar atmospheres to the objects' formation\nenvironments and other atmospheric aerosols. These insights could lead to\nimproved cloud models that help us better understand substellar atmospheres.\nFor example, we demonstrate that $f_{\\rm sed}$ could increase with increasing\ncloud base depth in an atmosphere, shedding light on the nature of the brown\ndwarf L/T transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 14:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Our contributions are four-fold: First, we propose a clustering\napproach to delineate a cortical parcellation that provides a reliable\nabstraction of the brain's functional organisation. Second, we cast the\nparcellation problem as a feature reduction problem and make use of manifold\nlearning and image segmentation techniques to identify cortical regions with\ndistinct structural connectivity patterns. Third, we present a multi-layer\ngraphical model that combines within- and between-subject connectivity, which\nis then decomposed into a cortical parcellation that can represent the whole\npopulation, while accounting for the variability across subjects. Finally, we\nconduct a large-scale, systematic comparison of existing parcellation methods,\nwith a focus on providing some insight into the reliability of brain\nparcellations in terms of reflecting the underlying connectivity, as well as,\nrevealing their impact on network analysis.\n  We evaluate the proposed parcellation methods on publicly available data from\nthe Human Connectome Project and a plethora of quantitative and qualitative\nevaluation techniques investigated in the literature. Experiments across\nmultiple resolutions demonstrate the accuracy of the presented methods at both\nsubject and group levels with regards to reproducibility and fidelity to the\ndata.

We derive\nequations relating retrodiction entropy and thermodynamic entropy, and as a\nspecial case, show that under equilibrium conditions, the two are identical. We\ndemonstrate relations involving the KL-divergence and retrodiction probability,\nand bound the time rate of change of retrodiction entropy. As a specific case,\nwe invert various Langevin processes, inferring the initial condition of \\(N\\)\nparticles given their final positions at some later time. We evaluate the\nretrodiction entropy for Langevin dynamics exactly for special cases, and find\nthat one's ability to infer the initial state of a system can exhibit two\npossible qualitative behaviors depending on the potential energy landscape,\neither decreasing indefinitely, or asymptotically approaching a fixed value. We\nalso study how well we can retrodict points that evolve based on the logistic\nmap. We find singular changes in the retrodictivity near bifurcations.\nCounterintuitively, the transition to chaos is accompanied by maximal\nretrodictability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 21:27:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 17:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

In this preliminary work, we present a new approach including these two\nkey elements. The spatio-temporal entropy enables to capture the regularity of\nthe mobility behavior of a user, while GAMs help to predict her demographic\ndata based on several co-variables including the spatio-temporal entropy.
