Recently, magnetic\nlayered semiconductors have attracted much attention due to their emerging new\nphysical phenomena. However, challenges still remain in the demonstration of a\ngate controllable magnetism based on them. Here, we show that, via ionic\ngating, strong field effect can be observed in few-layered semiconducting\nCr$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$Te$_{6}$ devices. At different gate doping, micro-area Kerr\nmeasurements in the studied devices demonstrate tunable magnetization loops\nbelow the Curie temperature, which is tentatively attributed to the moment\nre-balance in the spin-polarized band structure. Our findings of electric-field\ncontrolled magnetism in van der Waals magnets pave the way for potential\napplications in new generation magnetic memory storage, sensors, and\nspintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 16:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

A\nnon-overlapping domain decomposition algorithm reduces the global problem to a\ncoarse scale mortar interface problem, which is solved by an iterative solver,\nfor each stochastic realization. In the traditional implementation, each\nsubdomain solves a local Dirichlet or Neumann problem in every interface\niteration. To reduce this cost, two additional algorithms based on\ndeterministic or stochastic multiscale flux basis are introduced. The basis\nconsists of the local flux (or velocity trace) responses from each mortar\ndegree of freedom. It is computed by each subdomain independently before the\ninterface iteration begins. The use of the multiscale flux basis avoids the\nneed for subdomain solves on each iteration. The deterministic basis is\ncomputed at each stochastic collocation and used only at this realization. The\nstochastic basis is formed by further looping over all local realizations of a\nsubdomain's KL region before the stochastic collocation begins. It is reused\nover multiple realizations.

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nprobabilistic approach for the sign prediction problem. The main characteristic\nof the proposed models is their ability to adapt to the sparsity level of an\ninput network. The sparsity of networks is one of the major reasons for the\npoor performance of many link prediction algorithms, in general, and sign\nprediction algorithms, in particular. Building a model that has an ability to\nadapt to the sparsity of the data has not yet been considered in the previous\nrelated works. We suggest that there exists a dilemma between local and global\nstructures and attempt to build sparsity adaptive models by resolving this\ndilemma. To this end, we propose probabilistic prediction models based on local\nand global structures and integrate them based on the concept of smoothing. The\nmodel relies more on the global structures when the sparsity increases, whereas\nit gives more weights to the information obtained from local structures for low\nlevels of the sparsity. The proposed model is assessed on three real-world\nsigned networks, and the experiments reveal its consistent superiority over the\nstate of the art methods.

To activate a gene,\na TF has first to diffuse in the available space of the nucleus until it\nreaches a target DNA sequence or protein (target site). This eventually results\nin the recruitment of the whole transcriptional machinery.\n  All these processes take place in the mammalian nucleoplasm, a highly\norganized and dynamic environment, in which some complexes transiently assemble\nand break apart, whereas others appear more stable. This diversity of dynamic\nbehaviors arises from the number of biomolecules that make up the nucleoplasm\nand their pairwise interactions. Indeed, interactions energies that span\nseveral orders of magnitude, from covalent bounds to transient and dynamic\ninteractions can shape nuclear landscapes. Thus, the nuclear environment\ndetermines how frequently and how fast a TF contacts its target site, and\nindirectly gene expression. How exactly transient interactions are involved in\nthe regulation of TF diffusion is unclear, but are reflected by live cell\nimaging techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence\nrecovery after photobleaching or single-particle tracking. Overall, the\nmacroscopic result of these microscopic interactions is almost always anomalous\ndiffusion, a phenomenon widely studied and modeled.\n  Here, we review the connections between the anomalous diffusion of a TF and\nthe microscopic organization of the nucleus, including recently described\ntopologically associated domains and dynamic phase-separated compartments. We\npropose that anomalous diffusion found in single particle tracking (SPT) data\nresult from weak and transient interactions with dynamic nuclear substructures,\nand that SPT data analysis would benefit form a better description of such\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 19:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

The second part of the paper is devoted\nto so called \"reactor antineutrino anomaly\", which refers to deficiency of the\nmeasured flux of antineutrino from reactor in respect to the calculated flux by\n$3{\\sigma}$(deviation by 6.6%). Specific feature of the proposal in this paper\nlies in the fact that both anomalies can be accounted for by one and the same\nphenomenon of oscillation in baryon sector between a neutron and a neutron of\ndark matter $n{\\rightarrow}n'$ with mass $m_{n'}$, somewhat less than mass\n$m_n$ of an ordinary neutron. Calculations of the proposed model require one\nfree parameter: mass difference $m_n-m_{n'}$ if one normalizes probability of\noscillations for a free neutron on \"neutron anomaly\" 1%, then, having succeeded\nto interpret 6.6% of neutron anomaly in calculations, one can determine mass\ndifference.

Lattices\nof the posts in hexagonal and random distribution (average porosity of e = 0.94\nin the layer) are compared to each other with respect to the plain wall. Prior\nto impact, the vortex ring develops the early state of natural azimuthal\ninstabilities of different mode numbers N=5-7 competing with each other. While\nimpacting with the rough wall, a secondary ring is observed which is pushed\noutwards and is not wrapped around the primary ring as in flat wall impact.\nBetween both rings of opposite sign vorticity, a strong fluid rebound is\ninduced. The hexagonal lattice causes the rapid growth of further secondary\nvortex structures in a regular mode number N=6 arrangement at the outer edge of\nthe primary ring in form of six lobes which are aligned with the orientations\nof preferential pathways in the layer. At the outer tip of the lobes radial\nwall-jets are generated. Rotating the fakir geometry around the centre of\nimpact also rotates the jets location and direction accordingly.

In this paper, we extend these identifiability results to general\ninterventions, which may modify the dependencies between targeted variables and\ntheir causes without eliminating them. We define and characterize the\ninterventional Markov equivalence class that can be identified from general\n(not necessarily perfect) intervention experiments. We also propose the first\nprovably consistent algorithm for learning DAGs in this setting and evaluate\nour algorithm on simulated and biological datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 2018 23:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 23:27:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 17:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

Dropping this rank assumption we study the solutions to this equation\ngiven less restrictive generic conditions on its prolonged system. In this\nsetting we find that the solution stratifies the manifold according to the\nstrict signature (pointwise) of the solution and does this in way that locally\ngeneralizes the stratification of a model, where the model is, in each case, a\ncorresponding Lie group orbit decomposition of the sphere. Thus the solutions\ngive curved generalizations of such embedded orbit structures. We describe the\nsmooth nature of the strata and determine the geometries of each of the\ndifferent strata types; this includes a metric on the open strata that becomes\nsingular at the strata boundary, with the latter a type of projective infinity\nfor the given metric. The approach reveals and exploits interesting highly\nnon-linear relationships between different linear geometric partial\ndifferential equations. Apart from their direct significance, the results show\nthat, for the metrizability equation, strong results arising for so-called\nnormal BGG solutions, and the corresponding projective holonomy reduction,\nextend to a far wider class of solutions. The work also provides new results\nfor the projective compactification of scalar-flat metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Feb 2018 03:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 03:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

Unfortunately, computing the gradient of a\nspectral function is generally of cubic complexity, as such gradient descent\nmethods are rather expensive for optimizing objectives involving the spectral\nfunction. Thus, one naturally turns to stochastic gradient methods in hope that\nthey will provide a way to reduce or altogether avoid the computation of full\ngradients. However, here a new challenge appears: there is no straightforward\nway to compute unbiased stochastic gradients for spectral functions. In this\npaper, we develop unbiased stochastic gradients for spectral-sums, an important\nsubclass of spectral functions. Our unbiased stochastic gradients are based on\ncombining randomized trace estimators with stochastic truncation of the\nChebyshev expansions. A careful design of the truncation distribution allows us\nto offer distributions that are variance-optimal, which is crucial for fast and\nstable convergence of stochastic gradient methods.

This combined with a perpendicular paramagnetic\n(Pauli) limiting magnetic field stabilizes a staggered layer dependent\npair-density wave phase in the superconducting singlet channel. The high-field\npair-density wave phase is separated from the low-field BCS phase by a\nfirst-order phase transition.

Nine of these galaxies are\nconfirmed LyC emitters.

The precessing, power\nellipse (p-ellipse) orbit approximation provides accurate analytic orbit orbits\nin symmetric galaxy potentials. It remains useful for finding and fitting\nsimple loop orbits in the frame of a rotating bar with bar-like and symmetric\npower-law potentials. Second order perturbation theory yields two or fewer\nsimple loop solutions in these potentials. Numerical integrations in the\nparameter space neighborhood of perturbation solutions reveal zero or one ac-\ntual loops in a range of such potentials with rising rotation curves.

The method works\nin two iterative stages to provide reliable and wrist torque efficient grasps.\nInitially, a geometric object CoM is estimated from the input range data.

Although the data volume\nshared with the untrusted entities is significantly reduced, executing\ncomputationally demanding server-side tasks on resource-constrained smartphones\nis often impracticable.

The UAVs form several coalitions to efficiently complete the compound\ntasks which are impossible to be performed individually. The objectives of such\ncoalition formation are to firstly minimize resource consumption in completing\nthe encountered tasks on time, secondly to enhance the reliability of the\ncoalitions, and lastly in segregating the most trusted UAVs amid the self\ninterested of them. As many previous publications have merely focused on\nminimizing costs, this study considers a multi-objective optimization coalition\nformation problem that considers the three aforementioned objectives. In doing\nso, a leader-follower- inspired coalition formation algorithm amalgamating the\nthree objectives to address the problem of the computational complexity of\ncoalition formation in large-scale UAV networks is proposed. This algorithm\nattempts to form the coalitions with minimally exceeding the required resources\nfor the encountered tasks while maximizing the number of completed tasks. The\nproposed algorithm is based on Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms(QEA) which are a\ncombination of quantum computing and evolutionary algorithms.
