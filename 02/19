At the end of affinity\nmaturation, a number of cells sharing the same ancestor (i.e. in the same\n\"clonal family\") are released from the germinal center, their amino acid\nfrequency profile reflects the allowed and disallowed substitutions at each\nposition. These clonal-family-specific frequency profiles, called \"substitution\nprofiles\", are useful for studying the course of affinity maturation as well as\nfor antibody engineering purposes. However, most often only a single sequence\nis recovered from each clonal family in a sequencing experiment, making it\nimpossible to construct a clonal-family-specific substitution profile. Given\nthe public release of many high-quality large B cell receptor datasets, one may\nask whether it is possible to use such data in a prediction model for\nclonal-family-specific substitution profiles.

In this Rapid Communication, we\nshow via calculations how both properties can be determined without relying on\nreal-space imaging. The orbital magnetization and topological Hall conductivity\nmeasure the arising magnetization due to the circulation of electrons in the\nbulk and the occurrence of topologically protected edge channels due to the\nemergent field of a skyrmion crystal. Both observables quantify the topological\nHall effect and distinguish skyrmions from antiskyrmions by sign. Additionally,\nwe predict a magnetoelectric effect in skyrmion crystals, which is the\ngeneration of a magnetization (polarization) by application of an electric\n(magnetic) field.

Just like maps are gluings of polygons, colored triangulations are\nbuilt as gluings of special, higher-dimensional building blocks, such as\noctahedra, which we call colored building blocks and known in the dual as\nbubbles. A colored building block is determined by its boundary triangulation,\nwhich in the case of polygons is simply characterized by its length. In three\ndimensions, colored building blocks are labeled by some 2D triangulations and\nthose homeomorphic to the 3-ball are labeled by the subset of planar ones.\nSimilarly to Euler's formula in 2D which provides an upper bound to the number\nof vertices at fixed number of polygons with given lengths, we look in three\ndimensions for an upper bound on the number of edges at fixed number of given\ncolored building blocks. In this article we solve this problem when all colored\nbuilding blocks, except possibly one, are homeomorphic to the 3-ball. To do\nthis, we find a characterization of the way a colored building block\nhomeomorphic to the ball has to be glued to other blocks of arbitrary topology\nin a colored triangulation which maximizes the number of edges.

Intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT) is an\nincreasingly available imaging technique for ophthalmic microsurgery that\nprovides high-resolution cross-sectional information of the surgical scene. We\npropose to build on its desirable qualities and present a method for tracking\nthe orientation and location of a surgical needle. Thereby, we enable direct\nanalysis of instrument-tissue interaction directly in OCT space without complex\nmultimodal calibration that would be required with traditional instrument\ntracking methods. Method. The intersection of the needle with the iOCT scan is\ndetected by a peculiar multi-step ellipse fitting that takes advantage of the\ndirectionality of the modality. The geometric modelling allows us to use the\nellipse parameters and provide them into a latency aware estimator to infer the\n5DOF pose during needle movement. Results. Experiments on phantom data and\nex-vivo porcine eyes indicate that the algorithm retains angular precision\nespecially during lateral needle movement and provides a more robust and\nconsistent estimation than baseline methods.

However, such set-level constraints\ncannot learn the instance-level correspondences (e.g. aligned semantic parts in\nobject configuration task).

A lot of language\nspecifications have been defined in order-sorted algebra frameworks such as the\nlanguage specifications in K (an order-sorted algebra framework). The biggest\nproblem in a lot of the order-sorted algebra frameworks is that even if they\nmight allow developers to write programs and language specifications easily,\nbut they do not have a large set of tools to provide reasoning infrastructures\nto reason about the specifications built on the frameworks, which are very\ncommon in some many-sorted algebra framework such as Isabelle/HOL, Coq and FDR.\nThis fact brings us the necessity to marry the worlds of order-sorted algebras\nand many sorted algebras. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to translate a\nstrictly sensible order-sorted algebra to a many-sorted one in a restricted\ndomain by requiring the order-sorted algebra to be strictly sensible. The key\nidea of the translation is to add an equivalence relation called core equality\nto the translated many-sorted algebras.

This\nframework differs from classical Bayesian optimal design of experiments (ODE)\nin the following sense: we seek experimental designs that minimize the\nposterior uncertainty in the experiment end-goal, e.g., a quantity of interest\n(QoI), rather than the estimated parameter itself. This is suitable for\nscenarios in which the solution of an inverse problem is an intermediate step\nand the estimated parameter is then used to compute a QoI. In such problems, a\nGOODE approach has two benefits: the designs can avoid wastage of experimental\nresources by a targeted collection of data, and the resulting design criteria\nare computationally easier to evaluate due to the often low-dimensionality of\nthe QoIs. We present two modified design criteria, A-GOODE and D-GOODE, which\nare natural analogues of classical Bayesian A- and D-optimal criteria. We\nanalyze the connections to other ODE criteria, and provide interpretations for\nthe GOODE criteria by using tools from information theory. Then, we develop an\nefficient gradient-based optimization framework for solving the GOODE\noptimization problems.

The goal is to improve our knowledge of the orbital\nand stellar parameters of HD54662 and to analyze its X-ray emission to test the\ntheoretical scaling of the X-ray emission with orbital separation for adiabatic\nwind shocks. We applied a spectral disentangling code to optical spectra to\ndetermine the radial velocities and the individual spectra of each star. The\nindividual spectra were analyzed using the CMFGEN model atmosphere code. We\nfitted two X-ray spectra using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and\ncompared them to the emission expected from adiabatic shocks. We determine an\norbital period of 2103.4days, a low orbital eccentricity of 0.11, and a mass\nratio m2/m1=0.84. Combined with the orbital inclination inferred in a previous\nastrometric study, we obtain surprisingly low masses of 9.7 and 8.2Msun. From\nthe individual spectra, we infer O6.5 spectral types for both stars and a\nbrightness ratio of l1/l2~2. The softness of the X-ray spectra, the very small\nvariation of spectral parameters, and the comparison of the X-ray-to-bolometric\nluminosity ratio with the canonical value for O-type stars allow us to conclude\nthat X-ray emission from the wind interaction region is quite low. We cannot\nconfirm the runaway status previously attributed to HD54662 and we find no\nX-ray emission associated with the bow shock detected in the infrared. The lack\nof hard X-ray emission from the wind-shock region suggests that the mass-loss\nrates are lower than expected and/or that the pre-shock wind velocities are\nmuch lower than the terminal wind velocities. The bow shock associated with\nHD54662 possibly corresponds to a wind-blown arc created by the interaction of\nthe stellar winds with the ionized gas of CMa OB1.

It is generally assumed that life started\nfrom a random pool of oligonucleotides sequences, generated by a prebiotic\npolymerization of nucleotides. The mechanism that initially facilitated the\nemergence of sequences that code for the function of the first species from\nsuch a random pool of sequences remains unknown. It is a central problem of the\norigin of life. An interesting option would be a self-selection mechanism by\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. Initial concentration fluctuations of specific\nsequence motifs would have been amplified and outcompeted less abundant\nsequences, enhancing the signal to noise to replicate and select functional\nsequences. Here, we demonstrate with experimental and theoretical findings that\ntemplated ligation would provide such a self-selection. In templated ligation,\ntwo adjacent single sequences strands are chemically joined when a third\ncomplementary strand sequence brought them in close proximity. This simple\nmechanism was a likely side-product of a prebiotic polymerization chemistry\nonce the strands reach the length to form double stranded species. As shown\nhere, the ligation gave rise to a nonlinear replication process by the\ncooperative ligation of matching sequences which self-promoted their own\nelongation. This led to a cascade of enhanced template binding and faster\nligation reactions. A requirement was the reshuffling of the strands by thermal\ncycling, enabled for example by microscale convection. Assuming that templated\nligation was driven by the same chemical mechanism that generated prebiotic\npolymerization of oligonucleotides, the mechanism could function as a missing\nlink between polymerization and the self-stabilized replication, offering a\npathway to the autonomous emergence of Darwinian evolution for the origin of\nlife.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 08:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 01:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 07:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

A fundamental problem consists in designing a load balancing\nalgorithm that minimizes the delays experienced by jobs. During the last two\ndecades, the power-of-$d$-choice algorithm, based on the idea of dispatching\neach job to the least loaded server out of $d$ servers randomly sampled at the\narrival of the job itself, has emerged as a breakthrough in the foundations of\nthis area due to its versatility and appealing asymptotic properties. In this\npaper, we consider the power-of-$d$-choice algorithm with the addition of a\nlocal memory that keeps track of the latest observations collected over time on\nthe sampled servers. Then, each job is sent to a server with the lowest\nobservation.

The reliability of\nonline ratings, however, is potentially compromised by the so-called herding\neffect: when rating a product, customers may be biased to follow other\ncustomers' previous ratings of the same product. This is problematic because it\nskews long-term customer perception through haphazard early ratings. The study\nof herding poses methodological challenges. In particular, observational\nstudies are impeded by the lack of counterfactuals: simply correlating early\nwith subsequent ratings is insufficient because we cannot know what the\nsubsequent ratings would have looked like had the first ratings been different.\nThe methodology introduced here exploits a setting that comes close to an\nexperiment, although it is purely observational---a natural experiment. Our key\nmethodological device consists in studying the same product on two separate\nrating sites, focusing on products that received a high first rating on one\nsite, and a low first rating on the other. This largely controls for confounds\nsuch as a product's inherent quality, advertising, and producer identity, and\nlets us isolate the effect of the first rating on subsequent ratings. In a case\nstudy, we focus on beers as products and jointly study two beer rating sites,\nbut our method applies to any pair of sites across which products can be\nmatched. We find clear evidence of herding in beer ratings. For instance, if a\nbeer receives a very high first rating, its second rating is on average half a\nstandard deviation higher, compared to a situation where the identical beer\nreceives a very low first rating. Moreover, herding effects tend to last a long\ntime and are noticeable even after 20 or more ratings. Our results have\nimportant implications for the design of better rating systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 10:31:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 20:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

The goal of ATFCM is to make airport and\nairspace capacity meet traffic demand and, when capacity opportunities are\nexhausted, optimise traffic flows to meet the available capacity. One of the\nkey enablers of ATFCM is the accurate estimation of future traffic demand. The\navailable information (schedules, flight plans, etc.) and its associated level\nof uncertainty differ across the different ATFCM planning phases, leading to\nqualitative differences between the types of forecasting that are feasible at\neach time horizon. While abundant research has been conducted on tactical\ntrajectory prediction (i.e., during the day of operations), trajectory\nprediction in the pre-tactical phase, when few or no flight plans are\navailable, has received much less attention. As a consequence, the methods\ncurrently in use for pre-tactical traffic forecast are still rather\nrudimentary, often resulting in suboptimal ATFCM decision making. This paper\nproposes a machine learning approach for the prediction of airlines route\nchoices between two airports as a function of route characteristics, such as\nflight efficiency, air navigation charges and expected level of congestion.\nDifferent predictive models based on multinomial logistic regression and\ndecision trees are formulated and calibrated with historical traffic data, and\na critical evaluation of each model is conducted.

Since these measurements are\ngoing to be used to forecast Euclid's ability to test alternative dark matter\nmodels, we aim to set the final CMB constraint on the cross section of dark\nmatter-photon scattering in the early universe. As the formalism has not been\npublished in the literature yet, we present the key steps to derive the full\nset of linearized Einstein and Boltzmann equations and elucidate necessary\nmodifications to the line of sight and the tight coupling approximation. These\napproximation schemes are commonly used in Boltzmann codes to reduce\ncomputational costs, but the tight coupling regime has been neglected in\nprevious works related to dark matter-photon interactions. Our computations\naccount for a dark matter sound speed, which was neglected in previous work. We\nfind that its effect is negligible on the CMB spectra but fairly important on\nthe linear matter power spectrum. We then analyze the Planck data, with and\nwithout the 2015 polarization data at high multipoles. In both cases our\nconstraint on the ratio of the elastic scattering cross section to the dark\nmatter mass becomes more stringent with respect to previous constraints.

This includes theoretical as well as\nphenomenological aspects, such as the unification of the fundamental\ninteractions or the hierarchy problem. Based on the seminal works by Kaluza and\nKlein that were published nearly 100 years ago, we denote theories with at\nleast one compact periodic dimension as Kaluza-Klein theories. From a\ngravitational point of view the question arises, what are the fundamental\nsolutions to Einstein's field equations of general relativity under these\nassumptions. In particular, in this work we are concerned with black hole\nsolutions in Kaluza-Klein theory. Considering only the static case without\nelectric charge, it turns out that there is a much richer phase space than in\nthe usual four-dimensional theory, where only the Schwarzschild solution\nexists. There are at least two types of solutions with a completely different\nhorizon topology: localized black holes with an ordinary spherical horizon and\nblack strings with a horizon that wraps the compact dimension. Several\narguments favor the conjecture that the solution branches of both types are\nconnected via a singular topology changing solution that is controlled by the\nso-called double-cone metric. We study the regime close to this singular\ntransit solution in five and six spacetime dimensions with the help of a highly\naccurate numerical scheme that we describe in detail. Consequently, for the\nfirst time we are able to show that in this regime the black objects exhibit a\ncritical behavior, indicating that physical quantities are governed by\nuniversal critical exponents. Such exponents were already derived from the\ndouble-cone metric. We show that our data confirms these values extremely well.\nThis provides compelling evidence in favor of the double-cone metric as the\nlocal model of the transit solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 11:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

This\nneglect is unwarranted given that any strong vertical motions associated with\nthese waves could profoundly impact dust dynamics, dust sedimentation, planet\nformation, and the emissivity of the disc surface. In this paper we combine\nlinear calculations and shearing box simulations in order to investigate the\nvertical structure of spiral waves for various polytropic stratifications and\nwave amplitudes. For sub-adiabatic profiles we find that spiral waves develop a\npair of counter-rotating poloidal rolls. Particularly strong in the nonlinear\nregime, these vortical structures issue from the baroclinicity supported by the\nbackground vertical entropy gradient. They are also intimately connected to the\ndisk's g-modes which appear to interact nonlinearly with the density waves.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the poloidal rolls are ubiquitous in\ngravitoturbulence, emerging in the vicinity of GI spiral wakes, and potentially\ntransporting grains off the disk midplane. Other than hindering sedimentation\nand planet formation, this phenomena may bear on observations of the disk's\nscattered infrared luminosity.

This\nproblem has been addressed recently by applying a matrix exponential learning\n(MXL) algorithm which has a very appealing convergence rate. In this learning\nalgorithm, however, each transmitter must know an estimate of the gradient\nmatrix of the local utility. The knowledge of the gradient matrix at the\ntransmitters incurs a high signaling overhead especially that the matrix size\nincreases with the dimension of the action matrix. In this paper, we therefore\ninvestigate two strategies in order to decrease the informational exchange per\niteration of the algorithm. In the first strategy, each receiver sends at each\niteration part of the elements of the gradient matrix with respect to a certain\nprobability. In the second strategy, each receiver feeds back sporadically the\nwhole gradient matrix. We focus on the analysis of the convergence of the MXL\nalgorithm to optimum under these two strategies.

In the framework\nof a larger project to search for multiple population in open clusters, based\non literature and survey data, I found peculiar chemical abundance patterns in\na sample of intermediate age open clusters with publicly available data. More\nspecifically, fast rotating dwarf stars (v sini > 50km/s) belonging to four\nclusters display a bimodality in either [Na/Fe], [O/Fe] or both.

For cool main-sequence (MS) stars the abundances of many\nelements can be measured from spectroscopy, but ages are very hard to\ndetermine. The situation is different if the MS star has a white dwarf (WD)\ncompanion and a known distance, as the age of such a binary system can then be\ndetermined precisely from the photometric properties of the cooling WD. As a\npilot study for obtaining precise age determinations of field MS stars, we\nidentify nearly one hundred candidates for such wide binary systems: a faint WD\nwhose GPS1 proper motion matches that of a brighter MS star in Gaia/TGAS with a\ngood parallax ($\\sigma_\\varpi/\\varpi\\le 0.05$).

To investigate how degeneration affects VAE\nfrom a theoretical perspective, we illustrate the information transmission in\nVAE and analyze the intermediate layers of the encoders/decoders. Specifically,\nwe propose a Fisher Information measure for the layer-wise analysis. With such\nmeasure, we demonstrate that information loss is ineluctable in feed-forward\nnetworks and causes the degeneration in VAE. We show that skip connections in\nVAE enable the preservation of information without changing the model\narchitecture.

However, many challenges remain in the modeling of\nridesharing services, many of which are not currently under wide consideration.\nIn this paper, an agent-based model is developed to simulate a ridesharing\nservice in the Washington D.C. metropolitan region. The model is used to\nexamine levels of utility gained for both riders (customers) and drivers\n(service providers) of a generic ridesharing service. A description of the\nIndividual Agent Metro-Washington Area Ridesharing Model (IAMWARM) is provided,\nas well as a description of a typical simulation run. We investigate the\nfinancial gains of drivers for a 24-hour period under two scenarios and two\nspatial movement behaviors. The two spatial behaviors were random movement and\nVoronoi movement, which we describe. Both movement behaviors were tested under\na stationary run conditions scenario and a variable run conditions scenario. We\nfind that Voronoi movement increased drivers' utility gained but that emergence\nof this system property was only viable under variable scenario conditions.\nThis result provides two important insights: The first is that driver movement\ndecisions prior to passenger pickup can impact financial gain for the service\nand drivers, and consequently, rate of successful pickup for riders. The second\nis that this phenomenon is only evident under experimentation conditions where\nvariability in passenger and driver arrival rates are administered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 01:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

We also provide counterexamples to\nshow that when the loss function is replaced with quadratic loss or logistic\nloss, the result may not hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 02:13:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 18:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

Numerical studies on the stability\ndomain of dipolar magnetic fields found a dichotomy between non-reversing\ndipole-dominated dynamos and the reversing non-dipole-dominated multipolar\nsolutions. We show that, by considering weak initial fields, the above\ntransition disappears and is replaced by a region of bistability. Such a result\nwas also observed in models with free-slip boundaries in which the geostrophic\nzonal flow can develop and participate to the dynamo mechanism for non-dipolar\nfields. We show that a similar process develops in no-slip models when viscous\neffects are reduced sufficiently.\n  The following three regimes are distinguished: (i) Close to the onset of\nconvection ($Ra_c$) with only the most critical convective mode (wave number)\nbeing present, dynamos set in supercritically and are dipole-dominated. (ii) in\nthe range $3<Ra/Ra_c<Ra_c$, the bifurcations are subcritical and only\ndipole-dominated dynamos exist. (iii) $(Ra/Ra_c>10)$, the relative importance\nof zonal flows increases with $Ra$ in non-magnetic models. The field topology\ndepends on the magnitude of the initial magnetic field. The dipolar branch has\na subcritical behavior whereas the multipolar branch has a supercritical\nbehavior. By approaching more realistic parameters, the extension of this\nbistable regime increases. A hysteretic behavior questions the common\ninterpretation for geomagnetic reversals.\n  Far above the dynamo threshold (by increasing the magnetic Prandtl number),\nLorentz forces contribute to the first order force balance, as predicted for\nplanetary dynamos. When $Ra$ is sufficiently high, dipolar fields affect\nsignificantly the flow speed, the flow structure and heat transfer which is\nreduced by the Lorentz force regardless of the field strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 09:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The system has an operator\nwith a centralized objective. The agents, on the other hand, are selfinterested\nand strategic in the sense that each agent optimizes its own individual\nobjective. The operator aims to mitigate this misalignment by designing an\nincentive scheme for the agents. The problem is difficult due to the cost\nfunctions of the agents being coupled, the objective of the operator not being\nsocial welfare, and the operator having no direct control over actions being\nimplemented by the agents. This problem has been studied in many fields,\nparticularly in mechanism design and cost allocation. However, mechanism design\ntypically assumes that the operator has knowledge of the cost functions of the\nagents and the actions being implemented by the operator. On the other hand,\ncost allocation classically assumes that agents do not anticipate the effect of\ntheir actions on the incentive that they obtain. We remove these assumptions\nand present an incentive rule for this setup by bridging the gap between\nmechanism design and classical cost allocation. We analyze whether the proposed\ndesign satisfies various desirable properties such as social optimality, budget\nbalance, participation constraint, and so on. We also analyze which of these\nproperties can be satisfied if the assumptions of cost functions of the agents\nbeing private and the agents being anticipatory are relaxed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 02:56:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 01:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}
