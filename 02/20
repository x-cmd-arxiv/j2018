The biological effects of protons in\neach system were plotted against these metrics to quantify the degree of\nbiological uncertainty introduced by RBE variations in each case.\n  Results: When the biological effects of protons were plotted against dose\nalone, significant biological uncertainty was introduced as the LET-dependence\nof RBE was neglected. Plotting biological effects against dose $\\times$ LET\nsignificantly over-estimated the impact of LET on cell survival, leading to\nsimilar or greater levels of biological uncertainty. CWD, by contrast,\nsignificantly reduced biological uncertainties in both experiments and clinical\nplans.

Future progress towards scalable quantum\nsimulation of lattice gauge theories, however, hinges crucially on the\nefficient use of experimental resources. As we argue in this work, due to the\nfundamental non-uniqueness of discretizing the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian,\nthe lattice representation of gauge theories allows for an optimization that up\nto now has been left unexplored. We exemplify our discussion with lattice\nquantum electrodynamics in two-dimensional space-time, where we show that the\nformulation through Wilson fermions provides several advantages over the\npreviously considered staggered fermions.

Exploiting the optimal\nrepresentation, we propose an experiment based on a mixture of ultracold atoms\ntrapped in a tilted optical lattice.

A methodology should be developed to provide,\nindependently from the heterogeneous information collected with the different\ndetectors, a detector-independent specification of the radiation quality.\nHistorically the specification of the radiation quality is provided either, in\nterms of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) or in terms of lineal energy, y. First\nthis study focuses on identifying the correlation between the distributions of\nLET and the lineal energy spectra as well as the correspondence between their\nmean values calculated in frequency and in dose.

In randomized experiments with noncompliance, instrumental variable\nmethods can be used to control for the unmeasured confounding without censoring\nby death. But when there is censoring by death, the average causal treatment\neffect cannot be identified under usual assumptions, but can be studied for a\nspecific subpopulation by using sensitivity analysis with additional\nassumptions. However, in observational studies, evaluation of the local average\ntreatment effect (LATE) in censoring by death problems with unmeasured\nconfounding is not well studied.

Our\nmotivation is to achieve a light model that could be trained with insufficient\ntraining data. With this intuition, the processing of the 3-dimensional video\ninput is broken to 1D in temporal dimension on top of the 2D in spatial. The\nprocesses related to 2D spatial frames are being done by utilizing pre-trained\nnetworks with no training phase. The only step which involves training is to\nclassify the 1D time series resulted from the description of the 2D signals. As\na matter of fact, optical flow images are first calculated from consecutive\nframes and described by pre-trained CNN networks. Their dimension is then\nreduced using PCA. By stacking the description vectors beside each other, a\nmulti-channel time series is created for each video. Each channel of the time\nseries represents a specific feature and follows it over time. The main focus\nof the proposed method is to classify the obtained time series effectively.\nTowards this, the idea is to let the machine learn temporal features. This is\ndone by training a multi-channel one dimensional Convolutional Neural Network\n(1D-CNN). The 1D-CNN learns the features along the only temporal dimension.\nHence, the number of training parameters decreases significantly which would\nresult in the trainability of the method on even smaller datasets.

The nodes can exchange messages\nwith each other, and eventually each node has to stop and output its own\nrecoloring schedule, indicating when and how the node changes its color. The\nrecoloring schedules have to be globally consistent so that the graph remains\nproperly colored at each point, and we require that adjacent nodes do not\nchange their colors simultaneously.\n  We are interested in the following questions: How many communication rounds\nare needed (in the LOCAL model of distributed computing) to find a recoloring\nschedule? What is the length of the recoloring schedule? And how does the\npicture change if we can use extra colors to make recoloring easier?\n  The main contributions of this work are related to distributed recoloring\nwith one extra color in the following graph classes: trees, $3$-regular graphs,\nand toroidal grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 11:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

An assumption common to a vast majority of approaches is to\nallow $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n)$ memory per machine, where $n$ is the number of\nnodes in the graph and $\\widetilde{\\Omega}$ hides polylogarithmic factors.\nHowever, as pointed out by Karloff et al. [SODA'10] and Czumaj et al.\n[STOC'18], it might be unrealistic for a single machine to have linear or only\nslightly sublinear memory.\n  In this paper, we thus study a more practical variant of the MPC model which\nonly requires substantially sublinear or even subpolynomial memory per machine.\nIn contrast to the linear-memory MPC model and also to streaming algorithms, in\nthis low-memory MPC setting, a single machine will only see a small number of\nnodes in the graph. We introduce a new and strikingly simple technique to cope\nwith this imposed locality.\n  In particular, we show that the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem can be\nsolved efficiently, that is, in $O(\\log^3 \\log n)$ rounds, when the input graph\nis a tree. This constitutes an almost exponential speed-up over the low-memory\nMPC algorithm in $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$-algorithm in a concurrent work by Ghaffari\nand Uitto [SODA'19] and substantially reduces the local memory from\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n)$ required by the recent $O(\\log \\log n)$-round MIS\nalgorithm of Ghaffari et al. [PODC'18] to $n^{\\alpha}$ for any $\\alpha>0$,\nwithout incurring a significant loss in the round complexity.

When $k$ is very small (e.g., $k=d$), jointly\nsampling diverse subsets of points is crucial. One such method called volume\nsampling has a unique and desirable property that the weight vector it produces\nis an unbiased estimate of the optimum. It is therefore natural to ask if this\nmethod offers the optimal unbiased estimate in terms of the number of responses\n$k$ needed to achieve a $1+\\epsilon$ loss approximation.\n  Surprisingly we show that volume sampling can have poor behavior when we\nrequire a very accurate approximation -- indeed worse than some i.i.d. sampling\ntechniques whose estimates are biased, such as leverage score sampling. We then\ndevelop a new rescaled variant of volume sampling that produces an unbiased\nestimate which avoids this bad behavior and has at least as good a tail bound\nas leverage score sampling: sample size $k=O(d\\log d + d/\\epsilon)$ suffices to\nguarantee total loss at most $1+\\epsilon$ times the minimum with high\nprobability. Thus, we improve on the best previously known sample size for an\nunbiased estimator, $k=O(d^2/\\epsilon)$.\n  Our rescaling procedure leads to a new efficient algorithm for volume\nsampling which is based on a determinantal rejection sampling technique with\npotentially broader applications to determinantal point processes.

Theoretical studies showed\nthat quantum correlations can be used to revert the natural heat flow (from the\nhot body to the cold one), posing an apparent challenge to the second law of\nthermodynamics. Such an \"anomalous\" heat current was observed in a recent\nexperiment (arXiv:1711.03323), by employing two spin systems initially quantum\ncorrelated. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between this intriguing\nphenomenon and the initial conditions that allow it is not fully evident. Here,\nwe address energy transfer in a wider perspective, identifying a nonclassical\ncontribution that applies to the reversion of the heat flow as well as to more\ngeneral forms of energy exchange. We derive three theorems that describe the\nenergy transfer between two microscopic systems, for arbitrary initial\nbipartite states. Using these theorems, we obtain an analytical bound showing\nthat certain type of quantum coherence can optimize such a process,\noutperforming incoherent states. This genuine quantum advantage is corroborated\nthrough a characterization of the energy transfer between two qubits. For this\nsystem, it is shown that a large enough amount of coherence is necessary and\nsufficient to revert the thermodynamic arrow of time. As a second crucial\nconsequence of the presented theorems, we introduce a class of nonequilibrium\nstates that only allow unidirectional energy flow. In this way, we broaden the\nset where the standard Clausius statement of the second law applies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 17:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In particular, we\ninclude non-Gaussian covariance due to long-short mode-coupling from non-linear\nevolution, which manifests itself as long-mode cosmic variance in the\nposition-dependent power spectrum. We find that bispectrum forecasts that\nignore this cosmic variance may underestimate $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL})$ by up to a\nfactor $\\sim 3$ for the matter density (at $z=1$) and commonly a factor $\\sim\n2$ for the halo bispectrum.

From the boundary perspective, the\nvanishing of the bulk cosmological constant appears as the zero velocity of\nlight limit. This sets how Carrollian geometry emerges in flat holography. The\nnew boundary data are a two-dimensional spatial surface, identified with the\nnull infinity of the bulk Ricci-flat spacetime, accompanied with a Carrollian\ntime and equipped with a Carrollian structure, plus the dynamical observables\nof a conformal Carrollian fluid. These are the energy, the viscous stress\ntensors and the heat currents, whereas the Carrollian geometry is gathered by a\ntwo-dimensional spatial metric, a frame connection and a scale factor.

The human initiative influences the robot autonomy in two\nexplicit ways: with additive terms in the continuous controller and with\ncontingent task assignments. We propose an online coordination scheme that\nencapsulates (i) a mixed-initiative continuous controller that ensures all-time\nsafety despite of possible human errors, (ii) a plan adaptation scheme that\naccommodates new features discovered in the workspace and short-term tasks\nassigned by the operator during run time, and (iii) an iterative inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm that allows the robot to asymptotically\nlearn the human preference on the parameters during the plan synthesis.

In voice impersonation, the resultant\nvoice must convincingly convey the impression of having been naturally produced\nby the target speaker, mimicking not only the pitch and other perceivable\nsignal qualities, but also the style of the target speaker. In this paper, we\npropose a novel neural network based speech quality- and style- mimicry\nframework for the synthesis of impersonated voices. The framework is built upon\na fast and accurate generative adversarial network model. Given spectrographic\nrepresentations of source and target speakers' voices, the model learns to\nmimic the target speaker's voice quality and style, regardless of the\nlinguistic content of either's voice, generating a synthetic spectrogram from\nwhich the time domain signal is reconstructed using the Griffin-Lim method. In\neffect, this model reframes the well-known problem of style-transfer for images\nas the problem of style-transfer for speech signals, while intrinsically\naddressing the problem of durational variability of speech sounds. Experiments\ndemonstrate that the model can generate extremely convincing samples of\nimpersonated speech. It is even able to impersonate voices across different\ngenders effectively. Results are qualitatively evaluated using standard\nprocedures for evaluating synthesized voices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 20:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

Statistical significance and interval\nestimates are often computed for the logarithm of OR, ln(OR), and depend on the\nasymptotic standard error of ln(OR). For a sample of size N, the standard error\ncan be written as a ratio of sigma over square root of N, where sigma is the\npopulation standard deviation of ln(OR).

Data was randomly split on an exam level into\ntraining (50\\%), validation (10\\%) and testing (40\\%) of deep neural network\nwith u-net architecture. The u-net classifies the image but also provides\nlesion segmentation. Free receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis was\nused to evaluate the model, on an image and on an exam level. On an image\nlevel, a maximum sensitivity of 0.94 at 7.93 false positives (FP) per image was\nachieved. Similarly, per exam a maximum sensitivity of 0.98 at 7.81 FP per\nimage was achieved. In conclusion, the method could be used as a candidate\nselection model with high accuracy and with the additional information of\nlesion segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 21:39:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 09:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

A typical example is prime factorization\nthat may be solved in polynomial time by exploiting quantum entanglement on a\nquantum computer. There are, however, other types of (non-quantum) physical\nproperties that one may leverage to compute efficiently a wide range of hard\nproblems. In this perspective we discuss how to employ one such property,\nmemory (time non-locality), in a novel physics-based approach to computation:\nMemcomputing. In particular, we focus on digital memcomputing machines (DMMs)\nthat are scalable. DMMs can be realized with non-linear dynamical systems with\nmemory. The latter property allows the realization of a new type of Boolean\nlogic, one that is self-organizing. Self-organizing logic gates are\n\"terminal-agnostic\", namely they do not distinguish between input and output\nterminals. When appropriately assembled to represent a given\ncombinatorial/optimization problem, the corresponding self-organizing circuit\nconverges to the equilibrium points that express the solutions of the problem\nat hand. In doing so, DMMs take advantage of the long-range order that develops\nduring the transient dynamics. This collective dynamical behavior, reminiscent\nof a phase transition, or even the \"edge of chaos\", is mediated by families of\nclassical trajectories (instantons) that connect critical points of increasing\nstability in the system's phase space. The topological character of the\nsolution search renders DMMs robust against noise and structural disorder.\nSince DMMs are non-quantum systems described by ordinary differential\nequations, not only can they be built in hardware with available technology,\nthey can also be simulated efficiently on modern classical computers.

Many matrix factorization methods exist,\ncorresponding to different assumptions on the elements of the underlying matrix\nfactors. For example, many recent methods use a penalty or prior distribution\nto achieve sparse representations (\"Sparse FA/PCA\"). Here we introduce a\ngeneral Empirical Bayes approach to matrix factorization (EBMF), whose key\nfeature is that it uses the observed data to estimate prior distributions on\nmatrix elements. We derive a correspondingly-general variational fitting\nalgorithm, which reduces fitting EBMF to solving a simpler problem - the\nso-called \"normal means\" problem. We implement this general algorithm, but\nfocus particular attention on the use of sparsity-inducing priors that are\nuni-modal at 0. This yields a sparse EBMF approach - essentially a version of\nsparse FA/PCA - that automatically adapts the amount of sparsity to the data.\nWe demonstrate the benefits of our approach through both numerical comparisons\nwith competing methods and through analysis of data from the GTEx (Genotype\nTissue Expression) project on genetic associations across 44 human tissues. In\nnumerical comparisons EBMF often provides more accurate inferences than other\nmethods. In the GTEx data, EBMF identifies interpretable structure that\nconcords with known relationships among human tissues.

The most common\nfix is to submit a query several times, but this is not applicable in many\nsituations due to its prohibitive cost and due to the unrealistic assumption of\nindependent noise in different repetitions of the same query.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new weak oracle model, where a non-malicious\nuser responds to a pairwise comparison query only when she is quite sure about\nthe answer.

In this paper, we show that the families of ultramodular\ndiscrete copulas and their generalization to convex discrete quasi-copulas\nadmit representations as polytopes. We draw connections to the prominent\nBirkhoff polytope, alternating sign matrix polytope, and their most extensive\ngeneralizations in the discrete geometry literature. In doing so, we generalize\nsome well-known results on these polytopes from both the statistics literature\nand the discrete geometry literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 04:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 14:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

Such quantum coherence control in a solid\nensemble results in a near perfect retrieval efficiency and is applicable to\nultralong photon storage up to the spin phase relaxation time. Here, the basic\nphysics of the counter-intuitive quantum coherence control is presented not\nonly for two-photon (Raman) coherent transients, but also for a detailed\ncoherence transfer mechanism resulting in frequency up-/down-conversion.

This learning problem\nis known to be so hard that there is no learning algorithm that converges to\nthe truth for all possible CBNs (on the given set of variables). So the\nconvergence property has to be sacrificed for some CBNs---but for which? In\nresponse, the standard practice has been to design and employ learning\nalgorithms that secure the convergence property for at least all the CBNs that\nsatisfy the famous faithfulness condition, which implies sacrificing the\nconvergence property for some CBNs that violate the faithfulness condition\n(Spirtes et al. 2000). This standard design practice can be justified by\nassuming---that is, accepting on faith---that the true, unknown CBN satisfies\nthe faithfulness condition.

To mitigate these attacks, physical domain isolation,\nintroduced by CATT, physically separates each domain by dividing the physical\nmemory into multiple partitions and keeping each partition occupied by only one\ndomain. CATT implemented physical kernel isolation as the first generic and\npractical software-only defense to protect kernel from being rowhammered as\nkernel is one of the most appealing targets.\n  In this paper, we develop a novel exploit that could effectively defeat the\nphysical kernel isolation and gain both root and kernel privileges. Our exploit\ncan work without exhausting the page cache or the system memory, or relying on\nthe information of the virtual-to-physical address mapping. The exploit is\nmotivated by our key observation that the modern OSes have double-owned kernel\nbuffers (e.g., video buffers and SCSI Generic buffers) owned concurrently by\nthe kernel and user domains. The existence of such buffers invalidates the\nphysical kernel isolation and makes the rowhammer-based attack possible again.\nExisting conspicuous rowhammer attacks achieving the root/kernel privilege\nescalation exhaust the page cache or even the whole system memory. Instead, we\npropose a new technique, named memory ambush. It is able to place the\nhammerable double-owned kernel buffers physically adjacent to the target\nobjects (e.g., page tables) with only a small amount of memory. As a result,\nour exploit is stealthier and has fewer memory footprints. We also replace the\ninefficient rowhammer algorithm that blindly picks up addresses to hammer with\nan efficient one. Our algorithm selects suitable addresses based on an existing\ntiming channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 11:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 02:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 04:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 06:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

Within the used code, a certain part is invoked\nonly at runtime while the rest are executed at startup and/or shutdown phases\nin the kernel's lifetime run. In this paper, we propose a reliable and\npractical system, named KASR, which transparently reduces attack surfaces of\ncommodity OS kernels at runtime without requiring their source code. The KASR\nsystem, residing in a trusted hypervisor, achieves the attack surface reduction\nthrough a two-step approach: (1) reliably depriving unused code of executable\npermissions, and (2) transparently segmenting used code and selectively\nactivating them. We implement a prototype of KASR on Xen-4.8.2 hypervisor and\nevaluate its security effectiveness on Linux kernel-4.4.0-87-generic. Our\nevaluation shows that KASR reduces the kernel attack surface by 64% and trims\noff 40% of CVE vulnerabilities. Besides, KASR successfully detects and blocks\nall 6 real-world kernel rootkits.

Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain\ndegree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material\nsuccess. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the\nimportance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well\nknown that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among the\npopulation, whereas the distribution of wealth - considered a proxy of success\n- follows typically a power law (Pareto law). Such a discrepancy between a\nNormal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale, and the scale invariant\ndistribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind\nthe scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent-based model, we\nsuggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show\nthat, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in\nlife, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success,\nbeing overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our\nknowledge, this counterintuitive result - although implicitly suggested between\nthe lines in a vast literature - is quantified here for the first time. It\nsheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit on the basis of the\nreached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive\nhonors or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been\nsimply luckier than others. With the help of this model, several policy\nhypotheses are also addressed and compared to show the most efficient\nstrategies for public funding of research in order to improve meritocracy,\ndiversity and innovation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 11:37:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 11:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 15:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

Given a static underlying graph $G$, a temporal graph can be\nrepresented via an assignment of a set of integer time-labels to every edge of\n$G$, indicating the discrete time steps when this edge is active. While most of\nthe recent theoretical research on temporal graphs has focused on the notion of\na temporal path and other \"path-related\" temporal notions, only few attempts\nhave been made to investigate \"non-path\" temporal graph problems. In this\npaper, motivated by applications in sensor and in transportation networks, we\nintroduce and study two natural temporal extensions of the classical problem\nVertex Cover. In both cases we wish to minimize the total number of \"vertex\nappearances\" that are needed to \"cover\" the whole temporal graph. In our first\nproblem, Temporal Vertex Cover, the aim is to cover every edge at least once\nduring the lifetime of the temporal graph, where an edge can be covered by one\nof its endpoints, only at a time step when it is active. In our second, more\npragmatic variation Sliding Window Temporal Vertex Cover, we are also given a\nnatural number $\\Delta$, and our aim is to cover every edge at least once at\nevery $\\Delta$ consecutive time steps.

We\ninvestigate two scenarios that could lead to such a truncation, and find that\nthe observed SED is compatible with both. The first scenario involves the\ntruncation of both the dust and gas in the disc, perhaps due to a previous\ndynamical interaction or the presence of an undetected companion. The second\nscenario involves the fact that a radial location of 0.6 au is close to the\nexpected location of the H$_2$O snowline in the disc. As such, a combination of\nefficient dust growth, radial migration, and subsequent fragmentation within\nthe snowline leads to an optically thick inner dust disc and larger, optically\nthin outer dust disc. We find that a firm measurement of the CO $J=2$--1 line\nflux would enable us to distinguish between these two scenarios, by enabling a\nmeasurement of the radial extent of gas in the disc. Many models we consider\ncontain at least several Earth-masses of dust interior to 0.6 au, suggesting\nthat V410 X-ray 1 could be a precursor to a system with tightly-packed inner\nplanets, such as TRAPPIST-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 14:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

To compute the energy released into the MWT,\nthe dc fault current model and the MWT model are essential. An equivalent fuse\nwire model is utilized for the MWT for the crowbar applications.

To do so we assume that time dependence of the black hole\nmass and charge to be as step function. Our work is restricted to small\nsubregions where a collapsing null shell dose not penetrate the black holes\nhorizon. To calculate time dependent HEE we use perturbation method for small\nsubregions where turning point is much smaller than local equilibrium point of\nblack hole. We choose two shape functions for entangled regions on the boundary\nwhich are the strip and the ball regions. There is a saturation time at which\nthe null shell grazes the turning point and the HEE reaches to its maximum\nvalue.
