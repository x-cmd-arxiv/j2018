Usually, the rate of replacement for a given\nitem is not directly observable, but it is inferred by the estimated stability\nwhich, on the contrary, is observable. This idea goes back a long way in the\nlexicostatistical literature, nevertheless nothing ensures that it gives the\ncorrect answer. The family of Romance languages allows for a direct test of the\nestimated stabilities against the replacement rates since the proto-language\n(Latin) is known and the replacement rates can be explicitly computed. The\noutput of the test is threefold:first, we prove that the standard approach\nwhich tries to infer the replacement rates trough the estimated stabilities is\nsound; second, we are able to rewrite the fundamental formula of\nGlottochronology for a non universal replacement rate (a rate which depends on\nthe item); third, we give indisputable evidence that the stability ranking is\nfar from being the same for different families of languages. This last result\nis also supported by comparison with the Malagasy family of dialects. As a side\nresult we also provide some evidence that Vulgar Latin and not Late Classical\nLatin is at the root of modern Romance languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 12:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

The emergence of patterns generated by\ninteractions of diffusing proteins is a paradigmatic example for\nself-organization. In this article we review quantitative models for\nintracellular Min protein patterns in E. coli, Cdc42 polarization in S.\ncerevisiae, and the bipolar PAR protein patterns found in C. elegans. By\nanalyzing the molecular processes driving these systems we derive a theoretical\nperspective on general principles underlying self-organized pattern formation.\nWe argue that intracellular pattern formation is not captured by concepts such\nas \"activators\"', \"inhibitors\", or \"substrate-depletion\". Instead,\nintracellular pattern formation is based on the redistribution of proteins by\ncytosolic diffusion, and the cycling of proteins between distinct\nconformational states. Therefore, mass-conserving reaction-diffusion equations\nprovide the most appropriate framework to study intracellular pattern\nformation. We conclude that directed transport, e.g. cytosolic diffusion along\nan actively maintained cytosolic gradient, is the key process underlying\npattern formation. Thus the basic principle of self-organization is the\nestablishment and maintenance of directed transport by intracellular protein\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 16:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

The main question we ask is the following: to what extent are ordinary\nexpanders also good {wireless} expanders? We answer this question in a nearly\ntight manner. On the positive side, we show that any $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-expander\nwith maximum degree $\\Delta$ and $\\beta\\geq 1/\\Delta$ is also a $(\\alpha_w,\n\\beta_w)$ wireless expander for $\\beta_w = \\Omega(\\beta / \\log (2 \\cdot\n\\min\\{\\Delta / \\beta, \\Delta \\cdot \\beta\\}))$.

This\nabstraction supports replacing the non-holonomic, three-state unicycle model\nwith a much simpler two-state single-integrator model (i.e., a\nvelocity-controlled point). Yet this transformation comes at a performance\ncost, through the robot's precision and maneuverability. This work contains\nderivations for expressions of these precision and maneuverability costs in\nterms of the transformation's parameters. Furthermore, these costs show that\nonly selecting the parameter once over the course of an application may cause\nan undue loss of precision. Model Predictive Control (MPC) represents one such\nmethod to ameliorate this condition. However, MPC typically realizes a control\nsignal, rather than a parameter, so this work also proposes a Parametric Model\nPredictive Control (PMPC) method for parameter and sampling horizon\noptimization.

It states\nthat the two whole genome duplications had shaped the genome of early\nvertebrates. The most convincing evidence for 2R hypothesis comes from the 4:1\nratio chromosomal regions that have preserved both gene content and order in\nvertebrates compared with closely related. However, due to the shortage of such\nstrict evidence, the 2R hypothesis is still under debates.\n  Here, we present a combined perspective of phylogenetic and genomic homology\nto revisit the hypothesis of 2R whole genome duplications. Ancestral vertebrate\ngenomes as well as ancient duplication events were created from 17 extant\nvertebrate species. Extant descendants from the duplication events at early\nvertebrates were extracted and reorganized to partial genomes. We then examined\nthe gene order based synteny, and projected back to phylogenetic gene trees for\nexamination of synteny evidence of the reconstructed early vertebrate genes. We\nidentified 7877 ancestral genes that were created from 3026 duplication events\nat early vertebrates, and more than 50% of the duplication events show synteny\nevidence. Thus, our reconstructions provide very strong evidence for the 2R\nhypothesis.\n  We also reconstructed the genome of early vertebrates, and built a model of\nthe gene gains and losses in early vertebrates. We estimated that there were\nabout 12,000 genes in early vertebrates before 2R, and the probability of a\nrandom gene get lost after the first round of whole genome duplication is\naround 0.45, and the probability of a random gene get lost after the second\nround of whole genome duplication is around 0.55.\n  This research provides convincing evidence for the 2R hypothesis, and may\nprovide further insights in vertebral evolution.\n  Data availability: https://github.com/haimingt/Ohnologs-and-2R-WGD\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 16:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Various problems have been studied in this setting, but for some of\nthem the best-known results are those for general networks. In this paper we\ndevise significantly improved algorithms for various symmetry-breaking\nproblems, such as forests-decompositions, vertex-colorings, and maximal\nindependent set.\n  We analyze the running time of our algorithms as a function of the arboricity\n$a$ of a clique subgraph that is given as input.

Here, we present\na flexible computational inverse-design framework that allows the efficient\ntuning of one or more gaps at nearly arbitrary positions in the spectrum of\ndiscrete phononic metamaterial structures. The underlying algorithm optimizes\nthe linear response of elastic networks directly, is applicable to ordered and\ndisordered structures, scales efficiently in 2D and 3D, and can be combined\nwith a wide range of numerical optimization schemes. We illustrate the broad\npractical potential of this approach by designing mechanical bandgap switches\nthat open and close pre-programmed spectral gaps in response to an externally\napplied stimulus such as shear or compression. We further show that the\ndesigned structures can host topologically protected edge modes, and validate\nthe numerical predictions through explicit 3D finite element simulations of\ncontinuum elastica with experimentally relevant material parameters.

One of the main concerns in all of these devices is frequency\nnoise, which ultimately limits their applicability. This issue has attracted a\nlot of attention recently, and the origin of this noise remains elusive up to\ndate. In this Letter we present a very simple technique to measure frequency\nnoise in nonlinear mechanical devices, based on the presence of bistability. It\nis illustrated on silicon-nitride high-stress doubly-clamped beams, in a\ncryogenic environment. We report on the same $T/f$ dependence of the frequency\nnoise power spectra as reported in the literature. But we also find unexpected\n{\\it damping fluctuations}, amplified in the vicinity of the bifurcation\npoints; this effect is clearly distinct from already reported nonlinear\ndephasing, and poses a fundamental limit on the measurement of bifurcation\nfrequencies. The technique is further applied to the measurement of frequency\nnoise as a function of mode number, within the same device. The relative\nfrequency noise for the fundamental flexure $\\delta f/f_0$ lies in the range\n$0.5 - 0.01~$ppm (consistent with literature for cryogenic MHz devices), and\ndecreases with mode number in the range studied.

Predicting and reducing the surface dissipation in RF is\nmandatory, since it has a tremendous cost impact on most of the large\naccelerator projects. The theoretical approach of superconducting\nradiofrequency (SRF) behavior has been far less explored than DC behavior and\nis still based on the description of relatively simple systems, quite remote\nfrom the realistic material in use. Nevertheless, because the actual\ncrystalline substructure is not taken into account, it is still difficult to\npredict surface dissipation accurately. Moreover, Niobium with its large lambda\n(~40 nm), exhibit an original behavior compared to the usual superconductors\nused in applied superconductivity, and generalities (e.g. pinning at grain\nboundaries) needs to be reconsidered. In this paper we hope to demonstrate that\nsources of dissipation usually attributed to external causes (mainly flux\ntrapping during cooldown and hydrides precipitates) are related to the same\ntype of crystalline defects which are not grain boundaries; that they affect\nthe local superconducting properties and can also be at the source of early\nvortex penetration at the surface.

In this work, we explore how prior tasks can inform an agent about how\nto explore effectively in new situations.

The coordinates of\nan individual electron spin can then in principle be determined by introducing\na 10 to 100 nm diameter magnetic needle, scanning the needle, and collecting\nsignal as a function of the needle's position. Although individual electrons\nhave recently been localized with nanometer precision in this way using a\nnitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as the spin detector, the experiment's low\nsignal-to-noise ratio limited acquisition to two-dimensional scanning of just a\nfew dozen data points and was incompatible with nitroxide spin labels widely\nused to label proteins and nucleic acids. We introduce and numerically simulate\na protocol for detecting and imaging individual nitroxide electron spins\nmechanically with high spatial resolution. In our protocol a scanned\nmagnet-tipped cantilever is brought near the sample, modulated microwaves are\napplied to resonantly excite electron spins, and changes in spin magnetization\nare detected as a shift in the mechanical frequency of the cantilever. By\ncarefully applying resonant microwaves in short bursts in synchrony with the\ncantilever's oscillation, we propose to retain high spatial resolution even at\nlarge cantilever amplitude where sensitivity is highest. Numerical simulations\nreveal nanometer-diameter rings of frequency-shift signal as the tip is\nscanned. Our primary finding is that it is possible --- using a Bayesian,\nreverse Monte Carlo algorithm introduced here --- to obtain the full\nthree-dimensional distribution of electron coordinates from the signal rings\nrevealed in a two-dimensional frequency-shift map.

The two slopes correlate\nin the sense that steeper initial colour curves also imply steeper colour\ncurves at later phases. As suggested by recent studies, SNe~II form a\ncontinuous population of objects from the colour point of view as well. We\ninvestigate correlations between the observed colours and a range of\nphotometric and spectroscopic parameters including the absolute magnitude, the\n$V$-band light-curve slopes, and metal-line strengths. We find that less\nluminous SNe~II appear redder, a trend that we argue is not driven by\nuncorrected host-galaxy reddening. While there is significant dispersion, we\nfind evidence that redder SNe~II (mainly at early epochs) display stronger\nmetal-line equivalent widths. Host-galaxy reddening does not appear to be a\ndominant parameter, neither driving observed trends nor dominating the\ndispersion in observed colours. Intrinsic SN~II colours are most probably\ndominated by photospheric temperature differences, with progenitor metallicity\npossibly playing a minor role. Such temperature differences could be related to\ndifferences in progenitor radius, together with the presence or absence of\ncircumstellar material close to the progenitor stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

This implies that the R\\'enyi entropies of\nholographic CFTs will undergo phase transitions as the R\\'enyi parameter is\nvaried, as long as the theory possesses a scalar operator which is lighter than\na certain critical dimension. We show that this critical dimension has an\nelegant mathematical interpretation as the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set\nof a quotient group of AdS$_3$, and use this to compute it, analytically near\nthe boundary of moduli space and numerically in the interior of moduli space.\nWe compare this to a CFT computation generalizing recent work of Belin, Keller\nand Zadeh, bounding the critical dimension using higher genus conformal blocks,\nand find a surprisingly good match.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

People rely on the Internet to inform themselves on current news\nevents, as well as to verify facts. We, as a community, are quickly approaching\nan 'electronic information age' where the majority of information will be\ndistributed electronically and tools to preserve this information will become\nessential. While archiving online digital information is a good way to preserve\nonline information for future generations, it has many disadvantages including\nthe easy manipulation of archived information, e.g. by the archiving authority.\nOnline information is also prone to getting hacked or being taken offline.\nTherefore, it is necessary that archived online news information is securely\ntime-stamped with the date and time when it was first archived in a way that\ncannot be manipulated. The process of 'trusted timestamping' is an established\napproach for claiming that particular digital information existed at a\nparticular 'point in time' in the past. However, traditional approaches for\ntrusted timestamping depend on the time-stamping authority's fidelity. Directly\nembedding the hash of a digital file into the blockchain of a cryptocurrency is\na more recent method that allows for secure time-stamping, since digital\ninformation is stored as part of the transaction information in, e.g.\nBitcoin's, blockchain, and not stored at a centralized time-stamping authority.\nHowever, there is no system yet available, which uses this approach for\narchiving and time-stamping online news articles. Therefore, the aim of this\nthesis is to develop a system that 1) enables decentralized trusted\ntime-stamping of web and news articles as a means of making future manipulation\nof online information identifiable, and 2) allows users to determine the\nauthenticity of articles by checking different versions of the same article\nonline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:05:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 12:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

The effective temperature and the surface gravity at the pulsation\nphase of the spectroscopic observation were estimated using both optical (V)\nand NIR time-series photometric data. We found that the Mira is metal-rich\n([Fe/H]=-0.55 \\pm 0.15) and moderately alpha-enhanced ([alpha/Fe]=0.15 \\pm\n0.01, sigma=0.2). These values agree quite well with the mean cluster\nabundances based on high-resolution optical spectra of several cluster red\ngiants available in the literature ([Fe/H]=-0.47 \\pm 0.06, [alpha/Fe]=+0.24 \\pm\n0.05).

Methods. For a Gaussian density field, smoothed by the top-hat\nfilter, in real space, we used a simple kernel that gives the correct\ncorrelation between scales. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to construct\nrandom walks and to calculate first crossing distributions and consequently\nmass functions for a constant barrier. Results. We show that the evolution\nconsidered here improves the agreement with the results of N-body simulations\nrelative to analytical approximations which have been proposed from the same\nproblem by other authors.

In chapter 7 we prove the convergence of the $q$-deformation of the\n$so_{2n+1}$-Whittaker functions to the classical $so_{2n+1}$-Whittaker\nfunctions when $q \\to 1$. Finally, in chapter 8 we turn our interest to the\ncontinuous setting and construct a process on patterns which contains a\npositive temperature analogue of the Dyson's Brownian motion of type $B/C$.

Thus, source test case generation\nstrategy can make a big impact on the fault detection effectiveness of\nmetamorphic testing. Most of the previous studies on metamorphic testing have\nused either random test data or existing test cases as source test cases. There\nhas been limited research done on systematic source test case generation for\nmetamorphic testing. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation on the\nimpact of source test case generation techniques on the fault finding\neffectiveness of metamorphic testing. We evaluated the effectiveness of line\ncoverage, branch coverage, weak mutation and random test generation strategies\nfor source test case generation. The experiments are conducted with 77 methods\nfrom 4 open source code repositories. Our results show that by systematically\ncreating source test cases, we can significantly increase the fault finding\neffectiveness of metamorphic testing.

Our current understanding is that small-scale\ninternetwork (IN) magnetic fields play an important role as a heating agent.\nIndeed, cancellations of IN magnetic elements in the photosphere can produce\ntransient brightenings in the chromosphere and transition region. These bright\nstructures might be the signature of energy release and plasma heating,\nprobably driven by magnetic reconnection of IN field lines. Although single\nevents are not expected to release large amounts of energy, their global\ncontribution to the chromosphere may be significant due to their ubiquitous\npresence in quiet Sun regions. In this paper we study cancellations of IN\nelements and analyze their impact on the energetics and dynamics of the quiet\nSun atmosphere. We use high resolution, multiwavelength, coordinated\nobservations obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and\nthe Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) to identify cancellations of IN magnetic\nflux patches and follow their evolution. We find that, on average, these events\nlive for ~3 minutes in the photosphere and ~12 minutes in the chromosphere\nand/or transition region. Employing multi-line inversions of the Mg II h & k\nlines we show that cancellations produce clear signatures of heating in the\nupper atmospheric layers.

To annotate examples corpora for multiclass\nclassification, we might need to ask multiple yes/no questions, exploiting a\nlabel hierarchy if one is available. To address this more realistic setting, we\npropose active learning with partial feedback (ALPF), where the learner must\nactively choose both which example to label and which binary question to ask.\nAt each step, the learner selects an example, asking if it belongs to a chosen\n(possibly composite) class. Each answer eliminates some classes, leaving the\nlearner with a partial label. The learner may then either ask more questions\nabout the same example (until an exact label is uncovered) or move on\nimmediately, leaving the first example partially labeled. Active learning with\npartial labels requires (i) a sampling strategy to choose (example, class)\npairs, and (ii) learning from partial labels between rounds. Experiments on\nTiny ImageNet demonstrate that our most effective method improves 26%\n(relative) in top-1 classification accuracy compared to i.i.d. baselines and\nstandard active learners given 30% of the annotation budget that would be\nrequired (naively) to annotate the dataset.

A\nseries of recent research starting with (Alwen and Serbinenko, STOC 2015) has\ndeepened our understanding of the notion of memory-hardness in cryptography ---\na useful property of hash functions for deterring large-scale password-cracking\nattacks --- and has shown memory-hardness to have intricate connections with\nthe theory of graph pebbling.\n  In this work, we improve upon two main limitations of existing models of\nmemory-hardness. First, existing measures of memory-hardness only account for\ndynamic (i.e., runtime) memory usage, and do not consider static memory usage.\nWe propose a new definition of static-memory-hard function (SHF) which takes\ninto account static memory usage and allows the formalization of larger memory\nrequirements for efficient functions, than in the dynamic setting (where memory\nusage is inherently bounded by runtime). We then give two SHF constructions\nbased on pebbling; to prove static-memory-hardness, we define a new pebble game\n(\"black-magic pebble game\"), and new graph constructions with optimal\ncomplexity under our proposed measure.\n  Secondly, existing memory-hardness models implicitly consider linear\ntradeoffs between the costs of time and space. We propose a new model to\ncapture nonlinear time-space trade-offs and prove that nonlinear tradeoffs can\nin fact cause adversaries to employ different strategies from linear tradeoffs.\n  Finally, as an additional contribution of independent interest, we present\nthe first asymptotically tight graph construction that achieves the best\npossible space complexity up to $\\log{\\log{n}}$-factors for an existing\nmemory-hardness measure called cumulative complexity in the sequential pebbling\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 06:11:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 02:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

Producing photo-realistic and\nidentity preserving multi-view results is still a not well defined synthesis\nproblem. This paper proposes Load Balanced Generative Adversarial Networks\n(LB-GAN) to precisely rotate the yaw angle of an input face image to any\nspecified angle. LB-GAN decomposes the challenging synthesis problem into two\nwell constrained subtasks that correspond to a face normalizer and a face\neditor respectively. The normalizer first frontalizes an input image, and then\nthe editor rotates the frontalized image to a desired pose guided by a remote\ncode. In order to generate photo-realistic local details, the normalizer and\nthe editor are trained in a two-stage manner and regulated by a conditional\nself-cycle loss and an attention based L2 loss. Exhaustive experiments on\ncontrolled and uncontrolled environments demonstrate that the proposed method\nnot only improves the visual realism of multi-view synthetic images, but also\npreserves identity information well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 07:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 05:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

It is shown that, one may\nincrease the possibility of freezing the estimation degree of the parameters if\nonly the larger dimension system or both particles pass through the noisy phase\nchannel. Moreover, at small values of initial acceleration and large values of\nthe channel strength, the size of freezing estimation areas increases.

The challenge to combining these\ncomplimentary technologies is that they share a compounding limitation,\nconstrained transmit power. Regulations limit ultra wideband transmissions to\njust -41.3 dBm/MHz, and a backscatter device can only reflect the power it\nreceives. The solution is long-term integration of this limited power, lifting\nthe initially imperceptible signal out of the noise. This integration only\nworks while the target is stationary.

Especially, the observation of GW170104\nsuggests dynamically assembled binaries favoring a distribution of misaligned\nspins. It has been argued that mergers of unassociated BHs can be engendered\nthrough a \"chance meeting\" in a multiple BH system under gas-rich environments.\nIn this paper, we consider the merger of unassociated BHs, concordant with the\nmassive BH merger events. To that end, we simulate a multiple BH system with a\npost-Newtonian $N$-body code incorporating gas accretion and general\nrelativistic effects. As a result, we find that gas dynamical friction\neffectively promotes three-body interaction of BHs in dense gas of\n$n_\\mathrm{gas}\\gtrsim 10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, so that BH mergers can take\nplace within $30$ Myr. This scenario predicts an isotropic distribution of spin\ntilts. In the concordant models with GW150914, the masses of seed BHs are\nrequired to be $\\gtrsim 25~M_\\odot$. The potential sites of such \"chance\nmeeting\" BH mergers are active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks and dense\ninterstellar clouds. Assuming the LIGO O1, we roughly estimate the event rates\nfor PopI BHs and PopIII BHs in AGN disks to be respectively $\\simeq\n1-2\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\\simeq 1\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Multiple episodes of\nAGNs may enhance the rates by roughly an order of magnitude. For massive PopI\nBHs in dense interstellar clouds, the rate is $\\simeq 0.02\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.\nHence, high-density AGN disks are a more plausible site for mergers of chance\nmeeting BHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 09:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

In general, there exists a height difference\nbetween a BS and a UE in practical networks. It is common to utilize antenna\ndowntilt to adjust the direction of the vertical antenna pattern, and thus\nincrease received signal power or reduce inter-cell interference power to\nimprove network performance. This paper focuses on investigating the\nrelationship between the base station antenna downtilt and the downlink network\ncapacity in terms of the coverage probability and the ASE.

The combination\nof excluded-volume interactions and self-propulsion leads to several distinct\ndynamic phases as a function of bending rigidity, activity, and aspect ratio of\nindividual filaments. We consider first the case of intermediate filament\ndensity. For high-aspect-ratio filaments, we identify a transition with\nincreasing propulsion from a state of free-swimming filaments to a state of\nspiraled filaments with nearly frozen translational motion. For lower aspect\nratios, this gas-of-spirals phase is suppressed with growing density due to\nfilament collisions; instead, filaments form clusters similar to self-propelled\nrods, as activity increases. Finite bending rigidity strongly effects the\ndynamics and phase behavior. Flexible filaments form small and transient\nclusters, while stiffer filaments organize into giant clusters, similarly as\nself-propelled rods, but with a reentrant phase behavior from giant to smaller\nclusters as activity becomes large enough to bend the filaments. For high\nfilament densities, we identify a nearly frozen jamming state at low\nactivities, a nematic laning state at intermediate activities, and an\nactive-turbulence state at high activities. The latter state is characterized\nby a power-law decay of the energy spectrum as a function of wave number.

We observed these\nmassive stars using the FLAMES multi-object spectrograph at ESO-VLT. Available\nUV spectra from HST, IUE, and FUSE are also used. The spectral analysis is\nperformed with Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmospheres. We present the\nstellar and wind parameters of the OB stars and the two WR binaries in the N206\ncomplex. Twelve percent of the sample show Oe/Be type emission lines, although\nmost of them appear to rotate far below critical. We found eight runaway stars\nbased on their radial velocity. The wind-momentum luminosity relation of our OB\nsample is consistent with the expectations. The HRD of the OB stars reveals a\nlarge age spread (1-30 Myr), suggesting different episodes of star formation in\nthe complex. The youngest stars are concentrated in the inner part of the\ncomplex, while the older OB stars are scattered over outer regions. We derived\nthe present day mass function for the entire N206 complex as well as for the\ncluster NGC2018.

The cumulative mechanical\nfeedback from all massive stellar winds is comparable to the combined\nmechanical energy of the supernova explosions that likely occurred in the\ncomplex.

Current\nsolutions heavily depend on field surveys, remote sensing measurements and\nimage processing using reference markers, which often demand big investments of\ntime, effort and cost. This paper proposes Density Weighted Connectivity of\nGrass Pixels (DWCGP) to automatically estimate grass biomass from roadside\nimage data. The DWCGP calculates the length of continuously connected grass\npixels along a vertical orientation in each image column, and then weights the\nlength by the grass density in a surrounding region of the column. Grass pixels\nare classified using feedforward artificial neural networks and the dominant\ntexture orientation at every pixel is computed using multi-orientation Gabor\nwavelet filter vote. Evaluations on a field survey dataset show that the DWCGP\nreduces Root-Mean-Square Error from 5.84 to 5.52 by additionally considering\ngrass density on top of grass height. The DWCGP shows robustness to\nnon-vertical grass stems and to changes of both Gabor filter parameters and\nsurrounding region widths. It also has performance close to human observation\nand higher than eight baseline approaches, as well as promising results for\nclassifying low vs. high fire risk and identifying fire-prone road regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 11:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

The aim of this paper is to propose a new modelling\ntechnique suitable for the next generation of Space Weather predictive tools\nthat is both efficient and accurate. The aim of the new approach is to provide\ninterplanetary space weather forecasting models with accurate time dependent\nboundary conditions of erupting magnetic flux ropes in the upper solar corona.\nTo produce boundary conditions, we couple two different modelling techniques,\nMHD simulations and a quasi-static non-potential evolution model. Both are\napplied on a spatial domain that covers the entire solar surface. The\nnon-potential model uses a time series of observed synoptic magnetograms to\ndrive the non-potential quasi-static evolution of the coronal magnetic field.\nThis allows us to follow the formation and loss of equilibrium of magnetic flux\nropes. Following this a MHD simulation captures the dynamic evolution of the\nerupting flux rope. The present paper focuses on the MHD simulations that\nfollow the ejection of magnetic flux ropes to 4$R_\\odot$.

Not until its advent has such a trusted, transparent,\ncomprehensive and granular data set of digital economic behaviours been\navailable for public network analysis. In this article, by translating the\ncumbersome binary data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain into a high fidelity\ngraph model, we demonstrate through various analyses the often overlooked\nsocial and econometric benefits of employing such a novel open data\narchitecture. Specifically we show (a) how repeated patterns of transaction\nbehaviours can be revealed to link user activity across the blockchain; (b) how\nnewly mined bitcoin can be associated to demonstrate individual accumulations\nof wealth; (c) through application of the naive quantity theory of money that\nBitcoin's disinflationary properties can be revealed and measured; and (d) how\nthe user community can develop coordinated defences against repeated denial of\nservice attacks on the network. All of the aforementioned being exemplary\nbenefits that would be lost with the closed data models of the 'private\npermissioned' distributed ledger architectures that are dominating enterprise\nlevel development due to existing blockchain issues of governance, scalability\nand confidentiality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 11:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

Here we explore\nthe alternative approach of putting Exponential Weights (EW) first. We show\nthat many standard methods and their regret bounds then follow as a special\ncase by plugging in suitable surrogate losses and playing the EW posterior\nmean. For instance, we easily recover Online Gradient Descent by using EW with\na Gaussian prior on linearized losses, and, more generally, all instances of\nOnline Mirror Descent based on regular Bregman divergences also correspond to\nEW with a prior that depends on the mirror map. Furthermore, appropriate\nquadratic surrogate losses naturally give rise to Online Gradient Descent for\nstrongly convex losses and to Online Newton Step.

The two encryption schemes are based on dividing each image into\nblocks of different sizes. In the first scheme, the two dimension ($2$D) input\nimage is divided into various blocks of size $N \\times N$. Each block is\ntransformed into a one dimensional ($1$D) array by using the Zigzag pattern.\nThen, the exclusive or (XOR) logical operation is used to encrypt each block\nwith the analogous secret key. In the second scheme, after the transformation\nprocess, the first block of each image is encrypted by the corresponding secret\nkey. Then, before the next block is encrypted, it is XORed with the first\nencrypted block to become the next input to the encrypting routine and so on.\nThis feedback mechanism depends on the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of\noperation which considers the heart of some ciphers because it is highly\nnonlinear. In the case of color images, the color component is separated into\nblocks with the same size and different secret keys. The used secret key\nsequences are generated from elliptic curves (EC) over a \\textit{binary} finite\nfield $\\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}$. Finally, the experimental results are carried out\nand security analysis of the ciphered images are demonstrated that the two\nproposed schemes had a better performance in terms of security, sensitivity and\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

Over the\npast few decades, a lot of efforts have been conducted on studying the\nevolution of current sheets in 2-dimensional space, and concluded that\nsufficiently long current sheets always evolves into the so-called\n\"plasmoid-chain\", which provides fast reconnection rate independent of its\nresistivity. However, it is suspected that plasmoid-chain can exist only in the\ncase of 2-dimensional approximation, and would show transition to turbulence in\n3-dimensional space.\n  We performed 3-dimensional numerical simulation of relativistic current sheet\nusing resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic approximation. The results\nshowed that the 3-dimensional current sheet evolve not into plasmoid-chain but\nturbulence. The resulting reconnection rate is $0.004$ which is much smaller\nthan that of plasmoid-chain. The energy conversion from magnetic field to\nkinetic energy of turbulence is just 0.01\\% which is much smaller than typical\nnon-relativistic cases. Using the energy principle, we also showed that the\nplasmoid is always unstable for a displacement in opposite direction to its\nacceleration, probably interchange-type instability, and this always results in\nseeds of turbulence behind the plasmoids. Finally, the temperature distribution\nalong the sheet is discussed, and it is found that the sheet is less active\nthan plasmoid-chain. Our finding can be applied for many high energy\nastrophysical phenomena, and can provide a basic model of the general current\nsheet in Poynting-dominated plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 13:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The observed lines have three distinct features;\n(1) the line profiles are skewed and show significant low-energy tails, (2) the\nFe-K band have low variability, which produces a broad and deep dip in the\nroot-mean-square (rms) spectra, and (3) photons in this band have time lags\nbehind those in the adjacent energy bands with amplitudes of several $R_g/c$,\nwhere $R_g$ is the gravitational radius. The \"relativistic light bending model\"\nis proposed to explain these observed features, where a compact X-ray source\n(lamp post) above an extreme Kerr black hole illuminates the innermost area of\nthe accretion disc. In this paper, we critically examine the relativistic light\nbending model by computing the rms spectra and the lag features using a\nray-tracing technique, when a lamp post moves vertically on the black hole spin\naxis. As a result, we found that the observed deep rms dip requires that the\niron is extremely overabundant ($\\gtrsim10$ solar), whereas the observed lag\namplitude is consistent with the normal iron abundance. Furthermore,\ndisappearance of the lag in the high-flux state requires a source height as\nhigh as $\\sim40\\,R_g$, which contradicts the relativistically broad emission\nline feature. Our simulations agree with the data that the reverberation\nfeature moves to lower frequencies with larger source height, however, if this\nscenario is correct, the simulations predict detection of a clear Fe-K lag at\nlow frequencies, which is not constrained in the data. Therefore, we conclude\nthat the relativistic light bending model may not explain the characteristic\nFe-K spectral variations in Seyfert galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 13:14:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 02:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Infectious disease outbreaks in plants threaten ecosystems, agricultural\ncrops and food trade. Currently, several fungal diseases are affecting forests\nworldwide, posing a major risk to tree species, habitats and consequently\necosystem decay. Prediction and control of disease spread are difficult, mainly\ndue to the complexity of the interaction between individual components\ninvolved.\n  2. In this work, we introduce a lattice-based epidemic model coupled with a\nstochastic process that mimics, in a very simplified way, the interaction\nbetween the hosts and pathogen. We studied the disease spread by measuring the\npropagation velocity of the pathogen on the susceptible hosts. Quantitative\nresults indicate the occurrence of a critical transition between two stable\nphases: local confinement and an extended epiphytotic outbreak that depends on\nthe density of the susceptible individuals.\n  3. Quantitative predictions of epiphytotics are performed using the framework\nearly-warning indicators for impending regime shifts, widely applied on\ndynamical systems. These signals forecast successfully the outcome of the\ncritical shift between the two stable phases before the system enters the\nepiphytotic regime.\n  4. Synthesis: Our study demonstrates that early-warning indicators could be\nuseful for the prediction of forest disease epidemics through mathematical and\ncomputational models suited to more specific pathogen-host-environmental\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 13:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 22:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

In\nparticular, since learning algorithms generally improve with more and better\ndata, we propose shaping the feedback generation process as an alternate and\ncomplementary route to improving accuracy. To this effect, we explore how\nchanges to the user interface can impact the quality and quantity of feedback\ndata -- and therefore the learning accuracy. Motivated by information foraging\ntheory, we study how feedback quality and quantity are influenced by interface\ndesign choices along two axes: information scent and information access cost.\nWe present a user study of these interface factors for the common task of\npicking a movie to watch, showing that these factors can effectively shape and\nimprove the implicit feedback data that is generated while maintaining the user\nexperience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 14:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

In the context of limited and noisy data\nhowever, the use of a loss function that is specifically designed for top-k\nclassification can bring significant improvements. Our empirical evidence\nsuggests that the loss function must be smooth and have non-sparse gradients in\norder to work well with deep neural networks.

The\napplication of electric-field assisted placement techniques eliminates the\nelement of chemical treatment; however, it requires an incorporation of\nconductive placement electrodes that limit the performance, scaling, and\ndensity of integrated electronic devices.

Heterogeneous ensembles consist of predictors of different\ntypes, which are likely to have different biases. If these biases are\ncomplementary, the combination of their decisions is beneficial. In this work,\na family of heterogeneous ensembles is built by pooling classifiers from M\nhomogeneous ensembles of different types of size T. Depending on the fraction\nof base classifiers of each type, a particular heterogeneous combination in\nthis family is represented by a point in a regular simplex in M dimensions. The\nM vertices of this simplex represent the different homogeneous ensembles. A\ndisplacement away from one of these vertices effects a smooth transformation of\nthe corresponding homogeneous ensemble into a heterogeneous one.
