Within\nthe last few decades, hazard zone maps have been developed to systematically\napproach this threat. These maps mark vulnerable zones in habitable areas to\nallow effective planning of hazard mitigation measures and development of\nsettlements. Hazard zone maps have shown to be an effective tool to reduce\nfatalities during extreme events. They are created in a complex process, based\non experience, empirical models, physical simulations and historical data. The\ngeneration of such maps is therefore expensive and limited to crucially\nimportant regions, e.g. permanently inhabited areas.\n  In this work we interpret the task of hazard zone mapping as a classification\nproblem. Every point in a specific area has to be classified according to its\nvulnerability. On a regional scale this leads to a segmentation problem, where\nthe total area has to be divided in the respective hazard zones. The recent\ndevelopments in artificial intelligence, namely convolutional neuronal\nnetworks, have led to major improvement in a very similar task, image\nclassification and semantic segmentation, i.e. computer vision. We use a\nconvolutional neuronal network to identify terrain formations with the\npotential for catastrophic snow avalanches and label points in their reach as\nvulnerable. Repeating this procedure for all points allows us to generate an\nartificial hazard zone map. We demonstrate that the approach is feasible and\npromising based on the hazard zone map of the Tirolean Oberland. However, more\ntraining data and further improvement of the method is required before such\ntechniques can be applied reliably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 17:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

This\nsuggestion has become a part of the accepted paradigm on soil toxicity.\nConsequently, stringent fertilizer control programs to monitor Cd have been\nlaunched. Attempts to link Cd toxicity and fertilizers to chronic diseases are\ncommon. A re-assessment of this \"accepted\" paradigm is timely, given the larger\nbody of data available today. The data show that both the input and output of\nCd per hectare from fertilizers are negligibly small compared to the total\namount of Cd/hectare usually present in the soil itself. Calculations based on\ncurrent agricultural practices are used to show that it will take about 18\ncenturies to double the ambient soil-cadmium level, and about 8 centuries to\ndouble the soil-fluoride level, even after neglecting leaching and other\nremoval effects. Hence the concern of long-term agriculture should be the\ndepletion of available phosphate fertilizers, rather than the contamination of\nthe soil by trace metals or fluoride. This conclusion is confirmed by showing\nthat the claimed correlations between fertilizer input and cadmium accumulation\nin crops are not robust. Alternative scenarios that explain the data are\nexamined. Thus soil acidulation on fertilizer loading, and the effect of\nmagnesium, zinc, and fluoride ions contained in fertilizers are considered\nusing recent Cd$^{2+}$, Mg$^{2+}$ and F$^-$ ion-association theories. The\nprotective role of ions like Zn, Se, Fe, etc., is emphasized, and the question\nof cadmium toxicity in the presence of other ions is considered. These help to\nclarify and rectify difficulties found in the standard point of view. This\nanalysis does not modify the accepted views on Cd contamination by airborne\ndelivery, smoking, and industrial activity, or P-contamination causing algal\nblooms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 20:16:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 23:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

A key mechanical characteristic of these systems is their ability to\nreorganise in response to external stimuli, as implicated in e.g.\nhydration-induced swelling of keratin fibrils in human skin. During swelling,\nthe curvature of individual fibres changes to give a cooperative and reversible\nstructural reorganisation that opens up a pore network. The phenomenon is known\nto be highly dependent on topology, even if the nature of this dependence is\nnot well understood: certain ordered entanglements (`weavings') can swell to\nmany times their original volume while others are entirely incapable of\nswelling at all. Given this sensitivity to topology, it is puzzling how the\ndisordered entanglements of many real materials manage to support cooperative\ndilation mechanisms. Here we use a combination of geometric and\nlattice-dynamical modelling to study the effect of disorder on swelling\nbehaviour. The model system we devise spans a continuum of disordered\ntopologies and is bounded by ordered states whose swelling behaviour is already\nknown to be either vanishingly small or extreme. We find that while topological\ndisorder often quenches swelling behaviour, certain disordered states possess a\nsurprisingly large swelling capacity. Crucially, we show that the extreme\nswelling response previously observed only for certain specific weavings can be\nmatched---and even superseded---by that of disordered entanglements. Our\nresults establish a counterintuitive link between topological disorder and\nmechanical flexibility that has implications not only for polymer science but\nalso for our broader understanding of collective phenomena in disordered\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

When a line fails due to overloading, it is removed from\nthe system and $(1-\\varepsilon)$-fraction of the load it was carrying (at the\nmoment of failing) gets redistributed equally among all remaining lines in the\nsystem; hence we refer to this as the {\\it partial} load redistribution model.\nThe rest (i.e., $\\varepsilon$-fraction) of the load is assumed to be lost or\nabsorbed, e.g., due to advanced circuitry disconnecting overloaded power lines\nor an inter-connected network/material absorbing a fraction of the flow from\noverloaded lines. We analyze the robustness of this flow network against random\nattacks that remove a $p$-fraction of the lines. Our contributions include (i)\nderiving the final fraction of alive lines $n_{\\infty}(p,\\varepsilon)$ for all\n$p, \\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ and confirming the results via extensive\nsimulations; (ii) showing that partial redistribution might lead to (depending\non the parameter $0<\\varepsilon \\leq 1$) the order of transition at the\ncritical attack size $p^{*}$ changing from first to second-order; and (iii)\nproving analytically that flow networks achieve maximum robustness (quantified\nby the area $\\int_{0}^{1} n_{\\infty}(p,\\varepsilon) \\mathrm{d}p$) when all\nlines have the same free-space regardless of their initial load. The optimality\nof equal free-space allocation is also confirmed on real-world data from the UK\nNational Power Grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 04:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 14:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

We investigate and detail the\nstructure of the CWI's, their non-perturbative solutions and the transition to\nmomentum space, comparing them to perturbation theory by taking QED as an\nexample. We then proceed with an analysis of the $TJJ$ correlator, presenting\nindependent and detailed re-derivations of the conformal equations in the\nreconstruction method of BMS, originally formulated using a minimal tensor\nbasis in the transverse traceless sector. A careful comparison with a second\nbasis introduced in previous studies shows that this correlator is affected by\none anomaly pole in the graviton (T) line, induced by renormalization. The\nresult shows that the origin of the anomaly, in this correlator, should be\nnecessarily attributed to the exchange of a massless effective degree of\nfreedom.

However, if galaxies\nare aligned by large-scale tidal fields, then a sample with an\norientation-dependent selection effect has an additional anisotropy imprinted\nonto its correlation function. We use the LOWZ and CMASS catalogs of SDSS-III\nBOSS Data Release 12 to divide galaxies into two sub-samples based on their\noffset from the Fundamental Plane, which should be correlated with orientation.\nThese sub-samples must trace the same underlying cosmology, but have opposite\norientation-dependent selection effects. We measure the clustering parameters\nof each sub-sample and compare them in order to calculate the dimensionless\nparameter $B$, a measure of how strongly galaxies are aligned by gravitational\ntidal fields. We found that for CMASS (LOWZ), the measured $B$ was $-0.024 \\pm\n0.015$ ($-0.030 \\pm 0.016$).

This measurement constitutes evidence (between 2 and 3$\\sigma$)\nfor radial intrinsic alignments, and is consistent with theoretical\nexpectations ($<2\\sigma$ difference).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Nonarchimedean semidefinite programs encode parametric families of\nclassical semidefinite programs, for sufficiently large values of the\nparameter. Recently, a correspondence has been established between\nnonarchimedean semidefinite programs and stochastic mean payoff games with\nperfect information. This correspondence relies on tropical geometry. It allows\none to solve generic nonarchimedean semidefinite feasibility problems, of large\nscale, by means of stochastic game algorithms. In this paper, we show that the\nmean payoff of these games can be interpreted as a condition number for the\ncorresponding nonarchimedean feasibility problems. This number measures how\nclose a feasible instance is from being infeasible, and vice versa. We show\nthat it coincides with the maximal radius of a ball in Hilbert's projective\nmetric, that is included in the feasible set. The geometric interpretation of\nthe condition number relies in particular on a duality theorem for tropical\nsemidefinite feasibility programs. Then, we bound the complexity of the\nfeasibility problem in terms of the condition number. We finally give explicit\nbounds for this condition number, in terms of the characteristics of the\nstochastic game. As a consequence, we show that the simplest algorithm to\ndecide whether a stochastic mean payoff game is winning, namely value\niteration, has a pseudopolynomial complexity when the number of random\npositions is fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

Magnetar birth may be accompanied by the fall-back of stellar debris,\nlasting for seconds or longer following the explosion. Accretion alters the\nmagnetar evolution by (1) providing an additional source of rotational energy\n(or a potential sink, if the propeller mechanism operates); (2) enhancing the\nspin-down luminosity above the dipole rate by compressing the magnetosphere and\nexpanding the polar cap region of open magnetic field lines; (3) supplying an\nadditional accretion-powered neutrino luminosity that sustains the wind\nbaryon-loading, even after the magnetar's internal neutrino luminosity has\nsubsided.

The near-IR (~1-10 mic) part of the CIB, and its\nfluctuations, reflects emissions from nucleosynthetic sources and\ngravitationally accreting black holes (BHs). If known galaxies are removed to\nsufficient depths the source-subtracted CIB fluctuations at near-IR can reveal\nsources present in the first-stars-era and possibly new stellar populations at\nmore recent times. This review discusses the recent progress in this newly\nemerging field which identified, with new data and methodology, significant\nsource-subtracted CIB fluctuations substantially in excess of what can be\nproduced by remaining known galaxies. The CIB fluctuations further appear\ncoherent with unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB) indicating a very high\nfraction of BHs among the new sources producing the CIB fluctuations. These\nobservations have led to intensive theoretical efforts to explain the\nmeasurements and their properties. While current experimental configurations\nhave limitations in decisively probing these theories, their potentially\nremarkable implications will be tested in the upcoming CIB measurements with\nthe ESA's Euclid dark energy mission.

Compared to flash memory,\nmemristors have higher endurance, multi-bit data storage, and faster read/write\ntimes. However, although 2-terminal memristors have demonstrated basic neural\nfunctions, synapses in the human brain outnumber neurons by more than a factor\nof 1000, which implies that multiterminal memristors are needed to perform\ncomplex functions such as heterosynaptic plasticity.

In contrast to conventional spin valves, where\nswitching between high- and low-resistance configuration requires magnetization\nreversal by an applied magnetic field or a high-density spin-polarized current,\nwe provide an alternative path with the gate-controlled spin inversion in\ngraphene. The resulting tunable MPE employing a simple ferromagnetic metal\nholds promise for spintronic devices and to realize exotic topological states,\nfrom quantum spin Hall and quantum anomalous Hall effects, to Majorana fermions\nand skyrmions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 20:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Usually, these interactions are abstractions of the\ncommunication/diffusion channels between the units of the system. Real complex\nnetworks, e.g. traffic networks, reveal different operation phases governed by\nthe dynamical stress of the system. Here we show how, communicability, a\ntopological descriptor that reveals the efficiency of the network functionality\nin terms of these diffusive paths, could be used to reveal the transitions\nmentioned. By considering a vibrational model of nodes and edges in a\ngraph/network at a given temperature (stress), we show that the communicability\nfunction plays the role of the thermal Green's function of a network of\nharmonic oscillators. After, we prove analytically the existence of a universal\nphase transition in the communicability structure of every simple graph. This\ntransition resembles the melting process occurring in solids. For instance,\nregular-like graphs resembling crystals, melts at lower temperatures and\ndisplay a sharper transition between connected to disconnected structures than\nthe random spatial graphs, which resemble amorphous solids. Finally, we study\ncomputationally this graph melting process in some real-world networks and\nobserve that the rate of melting of graphs changes either as an exponential or\nas a power-law with the inverse temperature. At the local level we discover\nthat the main driver for node melting is the eigenvector centrality of the\ncorresponding node, particularly when the critical value of the inverse\ntemperature approaches zero. These universal results sheds light on many\ndynamical diffusive-like processes on networks that present transitions as\ntraffic jams, communication lost or failure cascades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 21:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

The smaller extent of\nthe hard continuum and Fe K{\\alpha} profiles imply that the optically thicker\nclouds responsible for this scattering may be relatively more prevalent closer\nto the nucleus. These clouds must not prevent soft ionizing X-rays from the AGN\nescaping to larger radii, in order to have photoionized ISM at larger radii.\nThis suggests that at smaller radii there may be a larger population of\nmolecular clouds to scatter the hard X-rays, as in the Milky Way.

We propose a new method to use Faraday\nrotation measurements in small scale star forming regions to find the direction\nand magnitude of the component of magnetic field along the line-of-sight. We\ntest the proposed method in four relatively nearby regions of Orion A, Orion B,\nPerseus, and California. We use rotation measure data from the literature. We\nadopt a simple approach based on relative measurements to estimate the rotation\nmeasure due to the molecular clouds over the Galactic contribution. We then use\na chemical evolution code along with extinction maps of each cloud to find the\nelectron column density of the molecular cloud at the position of each rotation\nmeasure data point. Combining the rotation measures produced by the molecular\nclouds and the electron column density, we calculate the line-of-sight magnetic\nfield strength and direction. In California and Orion A, we find clear evidence\nthat the magnetic fields at one side of these filamentary structures are\npointing towards us and are pointing away from us at the other side. Even\nthough the magnetic fields in Perseus might seem to suggest the same behavior,\nnot enough data points are available to draw such conclusions. In Orion B, as\nwell, there are not enough data points available to detect such behavior. This\nbehavior is consistent with a helical magnetic field morphology. In the\nvicinity of available Zeeman measurements in OMC-1, OMC-B, and the dark cloud\nBarnard 1, we find magnetic field values of $-23\\pm38~\\mu$G, $-129\\pm28~\\mu$G,\nand $32\\pm101~\\mu$G, respectively, which are in agreement with the Zeeman\nMeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

However, in addition to the text data itself, we often have\nadditional covariates associated with individual corpus documents---e.g. the\ndemographic of the author, time and venue of publication---and we would like\nthe embedding to naturally capture this information. We propose CoVeR, a new\ntensor decomposition model for vector embeddings with covariates. CoVeR jointly\nlearns a \\emph{base} embedding for all the words as well as a weighted diagonal\nmatrix to model how each covariate affects the base embedding. To obtain author\nor venue-specific embedding, for example, we can then simply multiply the base\nembedding by the associated transformation matrix. The main advantages of our\napproach are data efficiency and interpretability of the covariate\ntransformation. Our experiments demonstrate that our joint model learns\nsubstantially better covariate-specific embeddings compared to the standard\napproach of learning a separate embedding for each covariate using only the\nrelevant subset of data, as well as other related methods. Furthermore, CoVeR\nencourages the embeddings to be \"topic-aligned\" in that the dimensions have\nspecific independent meanings. This allows our covariate-specific embeddings to\nbe compared by topic, enabling downstream differential analysis.

This is aggravated by the\nfact that hands are highly deformable objects, and change in appearance\nfrequently. This work addresses the task of accurately localizing driver hands\nand classifying the grasp state of each hand. We use a fast ConvNet to first\ndetect likely hand regions. Next, a pixel-based skin classifier that takes into\naccount the global illumination changes is used to refine the hand detections\nand remove false positives. This step generates a pixel-level mask for each\nhand. Finally, we study each such masked regions and detect if the driver is\ngrasping the wheel, or in some cases a mobile phone. Through evaluation we\ndemonstrate that our method can outperform state-of-the-art pixel based hand\ndetectors, while running faster (at 35 fps) than other deep ConvNet based\nframeworks even for grasp analysis. Hand mask cues are shown to be crucial when\nanalyzing a set of driver hand gestures (wheel/mobile phone grasp and no-grasp)\nin naturalistic driving settings. The proposed detection and localization\npipeline hence can act as a general framework for real-time hand detection and\ngesture classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

In this work we test the hypothesis\nthat deep learning is able to upscale low resolution SI, together with the\nT1-weighted (T1w) image, to reconstruct high resolution SI. We report a novel\ndensely connected Unet (D-Unet) architecture capable of producing\nsuper-resolution spectroscopic images. The inputs for the D-UNet are the T1w\nimage and the low resolution SI image while the output is the high resolution\nSI. The results of the D-UNet are compared both qualitatively and\nquantitatively to simulated and in vivo high resolution SI. It is found that\nthis deep learning approach can produce high quality spectroscopic images and\nreconstruct entire 1H spectra from low resolution acquisitions, which can\ngreatly advance the current SI workflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 05:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 16:48:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 20:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Kardam consists of\ntwo complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first\nis scalar-based and ensures resilience against $\\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers.\nEssentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts\nas a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt\nthe progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by\nadjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme.

The problem can be solved in two parts:\ni) estimate a blur kernel from the blurry image, and ii) given estimated blur\nkernel, de-convolve blurry input to restore the target image. In this paper, we\npropose a graph-based blind image deblurring algorithm by interpreting an image\npatch as a signal on a weighted graph. Specifically, we first argue that a\nskeleton image---a proxy that retains the strong gradients of the target but\nsmooths out the details---can be used to accurately estimate the blur kernel\nand has a unique bi-modal edge weight distribution. Then, we design a\nreweighted graph total variation (RGTV) prior that can efficiently promote a\nbi-modal edge weight distribution given a blurry patch. Further, to analyze\nRGTV in the graph frequency domain, we introduce a new weight function to\nrepresent RGTV as a graph $l_1$-Laplacian regularizer. This leads to a graph\nspectral filtering interpretation of the prior with desirable properties,\nincluding robustness to noise and blur, strong piecewise smooth (PWS) filtering\nand sharpness promotion. Minimizing a blind image deblurring objective with\nRGTV results in a non-convex non-differentiable optimization problem. We\nleverage the new graph spectral interpretation for RGTV to design an efficient\nalgorithm that solves for the skeleton image and the blur kernel alternately.\nSpecifically for Gaussian blur, we propose a further speedup strategy for blind\nGaussian deblurring using accelerated graph spectral filtering. Finally, with\nthe computed blur kernel, recent non-blind image deblurring algorithms can be\napplied to restore the target image. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nalgorithm successfully restores latent sharp images and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 07:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

In this paper, we employ textual review information with ratings to\ntackle these limitations. Firstly, we apply a proposed aspect-aware topic model\n(ATM) on the review text to model user preferences and item features from\ndifferent aspects, and estimate the aspect importance of a user towards an\nitem. The aspect importance is then integrated into a novel aspect-aware latent\nfactor model (ALFM), which learns user's and item's latent factors based on\nratings. In particular, ALFM introduces a weighted matrix to associate those\nlatent factors with the same set of aspects discovered by ATM, such that the\nlatent factors could be used to estimate aspect ratings. Finally, the overall\nrating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings, which are\nweighted by the corresponding aspect importance. To this end, our model could\nalleviate the data sparsity problem and gain good interpretability for\nrecommendation. Besides, an aspect rating is weighted by an aspect importance,\nwhich is dependent on the targeted user's preferences and targeted item's\nfeatures. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed method can model a user's\npreferences on an item more accurately for each user-item pair locally.\nComprehensive experimental studies have been conducted on 19 datasets from\nAmazon and Yelp 2017 Challenge dataset.

A particular interest centers on the topological\nproperties of non-Hermitian systems, which exhibit unique phases with no\nHermitian counterparts. However, no systematic understanding in analogy with\nthe periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors has been\nachieved. In this paper, we develop a coherent framework of topological phases\nof non-Hermitian systems. After elucidating the physical meaning and the\nmathematical definition of non-Hermitian topological phases, we start with\none-dimensional lattices, which exhibit topological phases with no Hermitian\ncounterparts and are found to be characterized by an integer topological\nwinding number even with no symmetry constraint, reminiscent of the quantum\nHall insulator in Hermitian systems. A system with a nonzero winding number,\nwhich is experimentally measurable from the wave-packet dynamics, is shown to\nbe robust against disorder, a phenomenon observed in the Hatano-Nelson model\nwith asymmetric hopping amplitudes. We also unveil a novel bulk-edge\ncorrespondence that features an infinite number of (quasi-)edge modes. We then\napply the K-theory to systematically classify all the non-Hermitian topological\nphases in the Altland-Zirnbauer classes in all dimensions. The obtained\nperiodic table unifies time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, leading to\nhighly nontrivial predictions such as the absence of non-Hermitian topological\nphases in two dimensions. We provide concrete examples for all the nontrivial\nnon-Hermitian AZ classes in zero and one dimensions. In particular, we identify\na Z2 topological index for arbitrary quantum channels. Our work lays the\ncornerstone for a unified understanding of the role of topology in\nnon-Hermitian systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 10:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 03:53:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 14:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

In this paper, we present a framework for replacing and\nautomating a portion of these tasks. A screen-flow-based model of the tested\nsystem is incrementally reconstructed during the exploratory testing process by\ntracking testers' activities. With additional metadata, the model serves for an\nautomated navigation process for a tester.

The results\nshow that the time efficiency of the testing process improved with framework\nsupport.

The KOSR querying strives to find the top-k optimal routes (i.e., with\nthe top-k minimal total costs) from a given source to a given destination,\nwhich must visit a number of vertices with specific vertex categories (e.g.,\ngas stations, restaurants, and shopping malls) in a particular order (e.g.,\nvisiting gas stations before restaurants and then shopping malls).\n  To efficiently find the top-k optimal sequenced routes, we propose two\nalgorithms PruningKOSR and StarKOSR.

The current state-of-the-art of such mechanisms\nfor two-sided markets can be categorized as giving one (but not both) of the\nfollowing two types of approximation guarantees on the gains from trade: a\nconstant ex-ante guarantee, measured with respect to the second-best efficiency\nbenchmark, or an asymptotically optimal ex-post guarantee, measured with\nrespect to the first-best efficiency benchmark.

In chemical systems however,\nwhich can sometimes be quite complex, we do not appear to observe intricate\ncooperative interactions. A key question for the origin of life, is then how\ncan molecular cooperation first arise in an abiotic system prior to the\nemergence of biological replication. We postulate that selection at the\nmolecular level is a driving force behind the complexification of chemical\nsystems, particularly during the origins of life. In the theory of multilevel\nselection the two selective forces are: within-group and between-group, where\nthe former tends to favor \"selfish\" replication of individuals and the latter\nfavor cooperation between individuals enhancing the replication of the group as\na whole. These forces can be quantified using the Price equation, which is a\nstandard tool used in evolutionary biology to quantify evolutionary change. Our\ncentral claim is that replication and heredity in chemical systems are subject\nto selection, and quantifiable using the multilevel Price equation. We\ndemonstrate this using the Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain computer\nmodel, describing simple protocell composed out of molecules and its\nreplication, which respectively analogue to the group and the individuals. In\ncontrast to previous treatments of this model, we treat the lipid molecules\nthemselves as replicating individuals and the protocells they form as groups of\nindividuals. Our goal is to demonstrate how evolutionary biology tools and\nconcepts can be applied in chemistry and we suggest that molecular cooperation\nmay arise as a result of group selection. Further, the biological relation of\nparent-progeny is proposed to be analogue to the reactant-product relation in\nchemistry, thus allowing for tools from evolutionary biology to be applied to\nchemistry and would deepen the connection between chemistry and biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 13:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

In the case of liquids and\nliquid mixtures, this procedure increases in difficulty upon increasing density\nor concentration, and the use of sophisticated enhanced sampling techniques\nbecomes inevitable. In this work we propose an alternative strategy, spatially\nresolved thermodynamic integration, or SPARTIAN for short. Here, molecules are\ndescribed with atomistic resolution in a simulation subregion, and as ideal gas\nparticles in a larger reservoir. All molecules are free to diffuse between\nsubdomains adapting their resolution on the fly. To enforce a uniform density\nprofile across the simulation box, a single-molecule external potential is\ncomputed, applied, and identified with the difference in chemical potential\nbetween the two resolutions. Since the reservoir is represented as an ideal gas\nbath, this difference exactly amounts to the excess chemical potential of the\ntarget system. The present approach surpasses the high density/concentration\nlimitation of particle insertion methods because the ideal gas molecules\nentering the target system region spontaneously adapt to the local environment.\nThe ideal gas representation contributes negligibly to the computational cost\nof the simulation, thus allowing one to make use of large reservoirs at minimal\nexpenses. The method has been validated by computing excess chemical potentials\nfor pure Lennard-Jones liquids and mixtures, SPC and SPC/E liquid water, and\naqueous solutions of sodium chloride. The reported results well reproduce\nliterature data for these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

Such models do produce shadows. However,\nmodels with $M_0<2/3$ (or $R_b>3M$) have no photon sphere and do not produce a\nshadow. Instead, they produce an interesting `full-moon' image. These results\nimply that the presence of a shadow does not by itself prove that a compact\nobject is necessarily a black hole. The object could be a naked singularity\nwith $M_0\\geq 2/3$, and we will need other observational clues to distinguish\nthe two possibilities. On the other hand, the presence of a full-moon image\nwould certainly rule out a black hole and might suggest a naked singularity\nwith $M_0<2/3$. It would be worthwhile to generalize the present study, which\nis restricted to spherically symmetric models, to rotating black holes and\nnaked singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 11:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

Several 2D-, 2.5D- and 3D-based stabilization\ntechniques are well studied, but to our knowledge, no solutions based on deep\nneural networks had been proposed. The reason for this is mostly the shortage\nof training data, as well as the challenge of modeling the problem using neural\nnetworks. In this paper, we solve the video stabilization problem using a\nconvolutional neural network (ConvNet). Instead of dealing with offline\nholistic camera path smoothing based on feature matching, we focus on\nlow-latency real-time camera path smoothing without explicitly representing the\ncamera path. Our network, called StabNet, learns a transformation for each\ninput unsteady frame progressively along the time-line, while creating a more\nstable latent camera path. To train the network, we create a dataset of\nsynchronized steady/unsteady video pairs via a well designed hand-held\nhardware. Experimental results shows that the proposed online method (without\nusing future frames) performs comparatively to traditional offline video\nstabilization methods, while running about 30 times faster. Further, the\nproposed StabNet is able to handle night-time and blurry videos, where existing\nmethods fail in robust feature matching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

The main benefit of the\nE$_6$ GUT structure is the predictivity in the SM fermion sector, and a perfect\nfit to all SM observables can be obtained despite being over-constrained.\nDefinite predictions are made for the neutrino sector, with a Dirac CP phase\nthat is correlated to the CKM phase, allowing to test this model in the near\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 15:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The pion $q \\bar q$ eigenstate has\nzero mass for $m_q=0.$ The superconformal relations also can be extended to\nheavy-light quark mesons and baryons. The combined approach of light-front\nholography and superconformal algebra also provides insight into the origin of\nthe QCD mass scale and color confinement. A key observation is the remarkable\ndAFF principle which shows how a mass scale can appear in the Hamiltonian and\nthe equations of motion while retaining the conformal symmetry of the action.\nWhen one applies the dAFF procedure to chiral QCD, a mass scale $\\kappa$\nappears which determines universal Regge slopes, hadron masses in the absence\nof the Higgs coupling, and the mass parameter underlying the form of the\nnonperturbative QCD running coupling: $\\alpha_s(Q^2) \\propto \\exp{-{Q^2/4\n\\kappa^2}}$, in agreement with the effective charge determined from\nmeasurements of the Bjorken sum rule. The mass scale $\\kappa$ underlying hadron\nmasses can be connected to the parameter $\\Lambda_{\\overline {MS}}$ in the QCD\nrunning coupling by matching its predicted nonperturbative form to the\nperturbative QCD regime. One also obtains predictions for spacelike and\ntimelike hadronic form factors, structure functions, distribution amplitudes,\nand transverse momentum distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 20:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 19:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The\nprimary challenge is to find an answer for this question: \"How to balance\nbetween voter privacy and transparency without breaking the important rule\nwhere the voter can proof for a specific candidate that he voted for him in a\nbribe situation?\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 14:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

Realizing this, many researchers have\nstarted to design methods to exploit the drawbacks of deep learning based\nalgorithms questioning their robustness and exposing their singularities. In\nthis paper, we attempt to unravel three aspects related to the robustness of\nDNNs for face recognition: (i) assessing the impact of deep architectures for\nface recognition in terms of vulnerabilities to attacks inspired by commonly\nobserved distortions in the real world that are well handled by shallow\nlearning methods along with learning based adversaries; (ii) detecting the\nsingularities by characterizing abnormal filter response behavior in the hidden\nlayers of deep networks; and (iii) making corrections to the processing\npipeline to alleviate the problem. Our experimental evaluation using multiple\nopen-source DNN-based face recognition networks, including OpenFace and\nVGG-Face, and two publicly available databases (MEDS and PaSC) demonstrates\nthat the performance of deep learning based face recognition algorithms can\nsuffer greatly in the presence of such distortions. The proposed method is also\ncompared with existing detection algorithms and the results show that it is\nable to detect the attacks with very high accuracy by suitably designing a\nclassifier using the response of the hidden layers in the network. Finally, we\npresent several effective countermeasures to mitigate the impact of adversarial\nattacks and improve the overall robustness of DNN-based face recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 08:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

Despite the\nclear merits, major challenges persist in integrative analyses including an\nincomplete understanding of the structure-function relationship and\ninaccuracies in mapping anatomical structures due to deficiencies in existing\nimaging technology. Clearly advanced network modeling tools are needed to\nappropriately incorporate anatomical structure in constructing brain functional\nnetworks.

With FEP or exponential averaging, researchers tend\nto only sample MM states and calculate single point energy to get the free\nenergy estimates. In this case the sample size hysteresis arises and the\nconvergence is determined by bias elimination rather than variance\nminimization. Various criteria are proposed to evaluate the convergence issue\nand numerical studies are reported. It has been found that criteria including\nvariance of distribution, effective sample size, information entropies and so\non can be used and they are variance-of-distribution-dependent. However, no\ntheoretical interpretation is presented. In this paper we present theoretical\ninterpretations to dig the underlying statistical nature behind the problem.\nThe convergence criteria are proven to be related with variance of distribution\nin Gaussian approximated Exponential averaging. Further, we prove that these\nestimators are nonlinearly dependent on the variance of the free energy\nestimate. As these estimators are often orders of magnitude overestimated, the\nvariance of the FEP estimate is orders of magnitude underestimated. Hence,\ncomputing this statistical uncertainty is meaningless. In numerical calculation\nfrom timeseries data the effective sample size is bounded by 1 and N and thus\nthe variance of the free energy estimate is proven to be bounded by 0 and 1\n(kBT)2 for EXP and 0 and 2 (kBT)2 for BAR, which indicates an inevitable\nunderestimation.

New technology only exacerbates this dependence by increasing\nthe number, performance, and degree of autonomy and inter-connectivity of\nsoftware-empowered computers and cyber-physical \"things\", which translates into\nunprecedented scenarios of interdependence. As a consequence, guaranteeing the\npersistence-of-identity of individual & collective software systems and\nsoftware-backed organisations becomes an important prerequisite toward\nsustaining the safety, security, & quality of the computer services supporting\nhuman societies. Resilience is the term used to refer to the ability of a\nsystem to retain its functional and non-functional identity. In this article we\nconjecture that a better understanding of resilience may be reached by\ndecomposing it into ancillary constituent properties, the same way as a better\ninsight in system dependability was obtained by breaking it down into\nsub-properties. 3 of the main sub-properties of resilience proposed here refer\nrespectively to the ability to perceive environmental changes; understand the\nimplications introduced by those changes; and plan & enact adjustments intended\nto improve the system-environment fit. A fourth property characterises the way\nthe above abilities manifest themselves in computer systems. The 4 properties\nare then analyzed in 3 families of case studies, each consisting of 3 software\nsystems that embed different resilience methods. Our major conclusion is that\nreasoning in terms of resilience sub-properties may help revealing the\ncharacteristics and limitations of classic methods and tools meant to achieve\nsystem and organisational resilience. We conclude by suggesting that our method\nmay prelude to meta-resilient systems -- systems, that is, able to adjust\noptimally their own resilience with respect to changing environmental\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

In this regard, two-dimensional (2D) materials,\nspecifically boron and carbon nanosheets, have garnered enthusiasm due to their\nfascinating electronic, optical, mechanical and chemical properties. Recently,\na hydrogen boride (HB) nanosheet was successfully fabricated showing remarkable\nstability and superior physical properties. Motivated by this experimental\nstudy, we used first principle electronic structure calculations to study the\nfeasibility of this nanosheet to serve as an anode material for Li/Na/Ca/Mg/Al\nion batteries. Most active adsorption sites for single adatoms were evaluated\nand next adatoms were gradually inserted into the anode surface accordingly.\nThe charge transfer, electronic density of sates, storage capacity, structural\nstability, open-circuit potential and diffusion energy barriers were explored.\nOur theoretical study predicts that HB shows outstanding electrode properties\nfor Li and Na ion batteries. The intercalation of both Li and Na adatoms into\nthe HB monolayer can lead to a high identical storage capacity of 1133.8 mAh/g\nwhich is promising compared to the capacities of the traditional anode\nmaterials; such as graphite (372 mAh/g) and TiO2 (200 mAh/g), and other 2D\nmaterials; such as germanene (369 mAh/g), stanene (226 mAh/g), and phosphorene\n(432.8 mAh/g) nanosheets. These results may open a new horizon for the design\nof rechargeable batteries with higher storage capacitates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

Designing a low power optical\nreceiver for optical-to-electrical signal conversion has proven to be very\nchallenging. Current day receivers use a photodiode that produces a\nphotocurrent in response to input optical signals, and power hungry\ntrans-impedance amplifiers are required to amplify the small photocurrents.\nHere, we propose light helicity induced switching of magnetization to overcome\nthe requirement of photodiodes and subsequent trans-impedance amplification by\nsensing the change in magnetization with a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ).\nMagnetization switching of a thin ferromagnet layer using circularly polarized\nlaser pulses have recently been demonstrated which shows one-to-one\ncorrespondence between light helicity and the magnetization state. We propose\nto utilize this phenomena by using digital input dependent circularly polarized\nlaser pulses to directly switch the magnetization state of a thin Co/Pt\nferromagnet layer at the receiver. The Co/Pt layer is used as the free layer of\nan MTJ, the resistance of which is modified by the laser pulses. With the\none-to-one dependence between input data and output magnetization state, the\nMTJ resistance is directly converted to digital output signal. Our device to\ncircuit level simulation results indicate that, HDS based optical receiver\nconsumes only 0.124 pJ/bit energy, which is much lower than existing\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

While reviewing this construction,\nhere we emphasise how the new conceptual picture differs from the more typical\nviewpoint in theoretical physics of accounting for the properties of matter by\nfirst postulating entities on top of a given spacetime background or by\ngeometrically augmenting 4-dimensional spacetime itself.
