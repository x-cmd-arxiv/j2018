A detailed description of the dynamics of\nsuperfluid $^4$He is obtained from saturated vapor pressure up to\nsolidification. The single-excitation spectrum is substantially modified at\nhigh pressures, as the maxon energy exceeds the roton-roton decay threshold. A\nhighly structured multi-excitation spectrum is observed at low energies, where\nclear thresholds and branches have been identified. Strong phonon emission\nbranches are observed when the phonon or roton group velocities exceed the\nsound velocity.

They can be measured by applying a periodic drive\nto a DC-biased, small Josephson junction. Phase-locking between the periodic\ndrive and the Bloch oscillations then gives rise to steps at constant current\nin the I-V curves, also known as dual Shapiro steps. Unlike conventional\nShapiro steps, a measurement of these dual Shapiro steps is impeded by the\npresence of a parasitic capacitance. This capacitance shunts the junction\nresulting in a suppression of the amplitude of the Bloch oscillations. This\ndetrimental effect of the parasitic capacitance can be remedied by an on-chip\nsuperinductance. Additionally, we introduce a large off-chip resistance to\nprovide the necessary dissipation. We investigate the resulting system by a set\nof analytical and numerical methods. In particular, we obtain an explicit\nanalytical expression for the height of dual Shapiro steps as a function of the\nratio of the parasitic capacitance to the superinductance. Using this result,\nwe provide a quantitative estimate of the dual Shapiro step height.

Magnetic and structural characterization provides strong\nevidence that in the monolayer limit, the ferromagnetism originates from a vdW\nmanganese diselenide (MnSe$_2$) monolayer, while for thicker films it could\noriginate from a combination of vdW MnSe$_2$ and/or interfacial magnetism of\n$\\alpha$-MnSe(111).

These are\ncombined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed\ncharged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double\ncounting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the\ninner detector, energy deposits in the calorimeter, and reconstructed muons\nfrom the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution\nprocedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various\nE$_{T}^{miss}$ contributions. The individual terms as well as the overall\nreconstructed E$_{T}^{miss}$ are evaluated with various performance metrics for\nscale (linearity), resolution, and sensitivity to the data-taking conditions.\nThe method developed to determine the systematic uncertainties of the\nE$_{T}^{miss}$ scale and resolution is discussed.

In survival analysis it is often necessary to discriminate between\ninfluential and non-influential markers. Usually, the first step is to perform\na univariate screening step that ranks the markers according to their\nassociations with the outcome. It is common to perform screening using Cox\nscores, which quantify the associations between survival and each of the\nmarkers individually. Since Cox scores do not account for dependencies between\nthe markers, their use is suboptimal in the presence highly correlated markers.\nMethods: As an alternative to the Cox score, we propose the\ncorrelation-adjusted regression survival (CARS) score for right-censored\nsurvival outcomes. By removing the correlations between the markers, the CARS\nscore quantifies the associations between the outcome and the set of\n\"de-correlated\" marker values. Estimation of the scores is based on inverse\nprobability weighting, which is applied to log-transformed event times. For\nhigh-dimensional data, estimation is based on shrinkage techniques. Results:\nThe consistency of the CARS score is proven under mild regularity conditions.\nIn simulations, survival models based on CARS score rankings achieved higher\nareas under the precision-recall curve than competing methods. Two example\napplications on prostate and breast cancer confirmed these results. CARS scores\nare implemented in the R package carSurv. Conclusions: In research applications\ninvolving high-dimensional genetic data, the use of CARS scores for marker\nselection is a favorable alternative to Cox scores even when correlations\nbetween covariates are low. Having a straightforward interpretation and low\ncomputational requirements, CARS scores are an easy-to-use screening tool in\npersonalized medicine research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 17:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 09:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

For simplicity, our population is assumed to be composed of\njust two genetic types. Short bursts of selection acting in opposing directions\ndrive to maintain both types at intermediate frequencies, while the\nfluctuations due to 'genetic drift' work to eliminate variation in the\npopulation.\n  We consider first a population with no spatial structure, modelled by an\nadaptation of the Lambda (or generalised) Fleming-Viot process, and derive a\nstochastic differential equation as a scaling limit. This amounts to a limit\nresult for a Lambda-Fleming-Viot process in a rapidly fluctuating random\nenvironment. We then extend to a population that is distributed across a\nspatial continuum, which we model through a modification of the spatial\nLambda-Fleming-Viot process with selection. In this setting we show that the\nscaling limit is a stochastic partial differential equation. As is usual with\nspatially distributed populations, in dimensions greater than one, the 'genetic\ndrift' disappears in the scaling limit, but here we retain some stochasticity\ndue to the fluctuations in the environment, resulting in a stochastic p.d.e.\ndriven by a noise that is white in time but coloured in space.\n  We discuss the (rather limited) situations under which there is a duality\nwith a system of branching and annihilating particles.

Introducing new dynamics preserving this class\nof measures, we relate them to various stochastic processes, in particular the\nlog-gamma polymer in a half-quadrant (they are also related to the stochastic\nsix-vertex model in a half-quadrant and the half-space ASEP). For the polymer\nmodel, we provide explicit integral formulas for the Laplace transform of the\npartition function. Non-rigorous saddle point asymptotics yield convergence of\nthe directed polymer free energy to either the Tracy-Widom GOE, GSE or the\nGaussian distribution depending on the average size of weights on the boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 18:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 23:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

Torque magnetometry is a highly sensitive\ntechnique to directly quantify the anisotropy in quantum materials, such as the\nlayered high-T$_c$ superconductors, anisotropic quantum spin-liquids, and the\nsurface states of topological insulators. Here we introduce the magnetotropic\ncoefficient $k=\\partial^2 F/\\partial \\theta^2$, the second derivative of the\nfree energy F with respect to the angle $\\theta$ between the sample and the\napplied magnetic field, and report a simple and effective method to\nexperimentally detect it. A sub-$\\mu$g crystallite is placed at the tip of a\ncommercially available atomic force microscopy cantilever, and we show that $k$\ncan be quantitatively inferred from a shift in the resonant frequency under\nmagnetic field. While related to the magnetic torque $\\tau=\\partial F/\\partial\n\\theta$, $k$ takes the role of torque susceptibility, and thus provides\ndistinct insights into anisotropic materials akin to the difference between\nmagnetization and magnetic susceptibility.

NetChain exploits recent advances in\nprogrammable switches to store data and process queries entirely in the network\ndata plane.

The methods rely on auxiliary functionals, which\nare similar to Lyapunov functionals but satisfy different inequalities. The\ninequalities are enforced by requiring certain expressions to be sums of\nsquares of polynomials, and the optimal choice of auxiliary functional is posed\nas a semidefinite program (SDP) that can be solved computationally. To\nformulate these SDPs we approximate the PDE by truncated systems of ODEs and\nproceed in one of two ways. The first approach is to compute bounds for the ODE\nsystems, increasing the truncation order until bounds converge numerically. The\nsecond approach incorporates the ODE systems with analytical estimates on their\ndeviation from the PDE, thereby using finite truncations to produce bounds for\nthe full PDE. We apply both methods to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, where\nwe compute upper bounds on the spatiotemporal average of energy by employing\npolynomial auxiliary functionals up to degree six. The first approach is used\nfor most computations, but a subset of results are checked using the second\napproach, and the results agree to high precision. These bounds apply to all\nodd solutions of period $2\\pi L$, where $L$ is varied.

Our main conclusion is that the\nantiferromagnetic coupling between Mn spins and the in-plane magnetization of\nthe Mn spins can be explained neglecting effects due to the presence of the\nAu(111) surface, while for Ni-TCNQ the metal surface plays a role in\ndetermining the absence of magnetic anisotropy in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 18:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

The\ncomplex-structure moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds is a good testing ground\nfor this conjecture since it is known to encode quantum gravity physics. We\nstudy infinite distances in this setting and present new evidence for the above\nconjecture. Points in moduli space which are at infinite proper distance along\nany path are characterised by an infinite order monodromy matrix. We utilise\nthe nilpotent orbit theorem to show that for a large class of such points the\nmonodromy matrix generates an infinite orbit within the spectrum of BPS states.\nWe identify an infinite tower of states with this orbit. Further, the theorem\ngives the local metric on the moduli space which can be used to show that the\nmass of the states decreases exponentially fast upon approaching the point. We\nalso propose a reason for why infinite distances are related to infinite towers\nof states. Specifically, we present evidence that the infinite distance itself\nis an emergent quantum phenomenon induced by integrating out at one-loop the\nstates that become massless.

This structure allows for the identification of suitable\n`mass' terms to open band gaps. In this article, we extend these ideas to\nbosonic systems. Due to the pseudo-orthogonal nature of eigenvectors, the\nalgebra of matrices takes a very different form. Taking the honeycomb XY\nferromagnet as a prototype, we show that a Dirac cone emerges in the magnon\nspectrum.

At\nzero field, we find that the system undergoes a ferromagnetic transition with\nboth in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic components at $T_{c}$ ~ 100 K.

At $T$ ~ 1.5 K, where the spins are nearly aligned\nalong the $c$ axis, a spin reorientation occurs above a critical field $B_c$,\ngiving rise to a spin component perpendicular to the plane defined by the field\ndirection and the $c$ axis.

In this paper, we present an XMM-Newton survey of the\nOVII absorption lines in the spectra of Galactic XRBs. A total of 33 XRBs were\nselected, with 29 low mass XRBs and 4 high mass XRBs.

A particular\nchoice of the reflection boundary condition allows us to circumvent the\nhalf-space integrals that arise in the variational treatment of the original\nvacuum boundary conditions and which destroy the sparse coupling observed in\nnumerical approximation schemes based on truncated spherical harmonics\nexpansions.

Recent developments in deep-learning methods have enabled us\nto identify and classify individual cells from digital pathology images at\nlarge scale. The randomly distributed cells can be considered from a marked\npoint process, where each point is defined by its position and cell type.\nReliable statistical approaches to model such marked spatial point patterns can\nprovide new insight into tumor progression and shed light on the biological\nmechanisms of cancer. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling\nspatial correlations among three commonly seen cells (i.e. lymphocyte, stromal,\nand tumor) observed in tumor pathology images. A novel marking model of marked\npoint processes, with interpretable underlying parameters (some of which are\nclinically meaningful), is proposed in a Bayesian framework. We use Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, combined with the double\nMetropolis-Hastings (DMH) algorithm, to sample from the posterior distribution\nwith an intractable normalizing constant.

In this work, we propose a new neural\nnetwork architecture for the policy network representation that is simple yet\neffective. The proposed Structured Control Net (SCN) splits the generic MLP\ninto two separate sub-modules: a nonlinear control module and a linear control\nmodule. Intuitively, the nonlinear control is for forward-looking and global\ncontrol, while the linear control stabilizes the local dynamics around the\nresidual of global control. We hypothesize that this will bring together the\nbenefits of both linear and nonlinear policies: improve training sample\nefficiency, final episodic reward, and generalization of learned policy, while\nrequiring a smaller network and being generally applicable to different\ntraining methods.

Billing needs coarse-grained\nmeasurements where there are no, or minimal, privacy concerns. On the other\nhand, operation needs fine-grained measurements which can highly affect users'\nprivacy. Hence, users might be reluctant to participate in operational metering\nto protect their privacy. To overcome this issue, UP might offer rewards to\nallure users to report their measurements which endangers their privacy. In\nthis paper, we survey the literature on privacy-preserving metering in smart\ngrid. We propose a new taxonomy to categorize the literature based on whether\nmeasurements need to be attributable to users or not. This categorization is\nhighly effective because attribution is one of the main causes of privacy\nissues. Our survey shows that rewarding schemes and incentive-based demand\nresponse are new research topics with limited studies on it. Hence, we propose\ntwo privacy-preserving rewarding schemes for operational metering. First, a\nlight-weight solution that utilizes an already established link of trust i.e.\nBanks. It is based on the assumption that banks will not leak a client account\ndetails. This solution is based on hash chains and blind signatures to assure\nusers anonymity with minimal overhead for the UP and the smart meter. The bank\nin this approach is state-less in which is not required the bank to keep\ncommunications states of users and the UP. Second, we proposed another approach\nthat does not rely on or banks or trusted third parties. It is based on\nPaillier homomorphic encryption and Pedersen commitments. It assumes that the\nsmart meters are organized in a tree structure; which is widely used\nimplementation in the literature.

We\napply this technique to a large sample of quasars, whose total gas content\nwould be prohibitively expensive to measure. We present a comprehensive study\nof the full (1 to 500 micron) infrared spectral energy distributions of 87\nredshift <0.5 quasars selected from the Palomar-Green sample, using photometric\nmeasurements from 2MASS, WISE, and Herschel, combined with Spitzer mid-infrared\n(5 to 40 micron) spectra. With a newly developed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo fitting method, we decompose various overlapping contributions to the\nintegrated spectral energy distribution, including starlight, warm dust from\nthe torus, and cooler dust on galaxy scales. This procedure yields a robust\ndust mass, which we use to infer the gas mass, using a gas-to-dust ratio\nconstrained by the host galaxy stellar mass. Most (90%) quasar hosts have gas\nfractions similar to those of massive, star-forming galaxies, although a\nminority (10%) seem genuinely gas-deficient, resembling present-day massive\nearly-type galaxies.

It is shown that at perpendicular shocks the electron acceleration\nefficiency is enhanced with the decreasing of $\\left(b/B_0\\right)^2$, and at\n$\\left(b/B_0\\right)^2=0.01$ the acceleration becomes significant due to strong\ndrift electric field with long time particles staying near the shock front for\nshock drift acceleration (SDA).

An Eulerian model\nusing a coarse-grained field on a grid cannot properly resolve regions of\nsaturation---in which condensation occurs---that are smaller than the grid\nboxes. Thus, in the absence of a parameterization scheme, either the grid box\nmust become saturated or condensation will be underestimated. On the other\nhand, in a stochastic Lagrangian model of moisture transport, trajectories of\nparcels tagged with humidity variables are tracked and small-scale moisture\nvariability can be retained; however, explicitly implementing such a scheme in\na global model would be computationally prohibitive. One way to introduce\nsubgrid-scale saturation into an Eulerian model is to assume the humidity\nwithin a grid box has a probability distribution. To close the problem, this\ndistribution is conventionally determined by relating the required\nsubgrid-scale properties of the flow to the grid-scale properties using a\nturbulence closure. Here, instead, we determine an assumed probability\ndistribution by using the statistical moments from a stochastic Lagrangian\nversion of the system. The stochastic system is governed by a Fokker--Planck\nequation and we use that, rather than explicitly following the moisture\nparcels, to determine the parameters of the assumed distribution. We are thus\nable to parameterize subgrid-scale condensation in an Eulerian model in a\ncomputationally efficient and theoretically well-founded way.

Though\npromising performances can be delivered, MDP-DIV suffers from a very slow\nconvergence, which hinders its usability in real applications. In this paper,\nwe aim to promote the performance of MDP-DIV by speeding up the convergence\nrate without much accuracy sacrifice. The slow convergence is incurred by two\nmain reasons: the large action space and data scarcity. On the one hand, the\nsequential decision making at each position needs to evaluate the\nquery-document relevance for all the candidate set, which results in a huge\nsearching space for MDP; on the other hand, due to the data scarcity, the agent\nhas to proceed more \"trial and error\" interactions with the environment. To\ntackle this problem, we propose MDP-DIV-kNN and MDP-DIV-NTN methods. The\nMDP-DIV-kNN method adopts a $k$ nearest neighbor strategy, i.e., discarding the\n$k$ nearest neighbors of the recently-selected action (document), to reduce the\ndiversification searching space. The MDP-DIV-NTN employs a pre-trained\ndiversification neural tensor network (NTN-DIV) as the evaluation model, and\ncombines the results with MDP to produce the final ranking solution. The\nexperiment results demonstrate that the two proposed methods indeed accelerate\nthe convergence rate of the MDP-DIV, which is 3x faster, while the accuracies\nproduced barely degrade, or even are better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 06:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

The neutral solute in water\nshows a nonmonotonicity in the size dependence of diffusion. This is usually\nconnected to the well known Levitation effect where it is found that when\nsolute diffuses through the transient solvent cages then for attractive\nsolute-solvent interaction and for a particular size of the solute there is a\nforce balance which leads to the maximum in diffusion. Similar maximum in\ndiffusion of charged solutes has also been observed and connected to Levitation\neffect. However, earlier studies of ionic diffusion connects this\nnonmonotonicity to the interplay between hard sphere repulsion and Coulombic\nattraction. In this work, we show that although the size dependence of both\ncharged and neutral solutes have a nonmonotonicity, there is a stark difference\nin their behaviour. For charged solute with increase in attraction the maximum\nshifts to higher solute sizes and has a lower value whereas for neutral solute\nit remains at the same place and has a higher value. We show by studying the\nionic and non-ionic part of the potential that for larger solutes it is the\nnonionic part which dominates and for smaller solutes the ionic part and the is\na transition between them. As the charge on the solute increases, this\ntransition takes place at larger solute sizes which leads to the shift in the\ndiffusivity maxima and reduction of the peak value.

As for the extrinsic channel, a finite anomalous\nHall current is obtained from the impurity scattering with the optically\nexcited normal quasiparticle current even at zero temperature. From our kinetic\ndescription, it can be clearly seen that the excited normal quasiparticle\ncurrent is due to an induced center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs through\nthe acceleration driven by ac electric field. For the induced anomalous Hall\ncurrent, we show that the conventional skew-scattering channel in the linear\nresponse makes the dominant contribution in the strong impurity interaction. In\nthis case, our kinetic description as a supplementary viewpoint mostly confirms\nthe results of Kubo formalism in the literature. Nevertheless, in the weak\nimpurity interaction, this skew-scattering channel becomes marginal and we\nreveal that a novel induction channel from the Born contribution dominates the\nanomalous Hall current. This novel channel, which has long been overlooked in\nthe literature, is due to the particle-hole asymmetry by nonlinear optical\nexcitation. Finally, we study the case in the chiral p-wave superconducting\nstate with a transverse conical magnetization, which breaks the Galilean\ninvariance. In this situation, the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is no\nlonger zero. Comparison of this intrinsic channel with the extrinsic one from\nimpurity scattering is addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 08:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

In the experiments, we analyzed time variations in thickness and infrared\nspectra of solid organic film formed on an optical window in a reaction cell.\nGas species formed by FUV irradiation were also analyzed and compared with\nphotochemical model calculations. Our experimental results show that the growth\nrate of the organic film decreases as the CH4/CO2 ratio of reactant gas mixture\ndecreases, and that the decrease becomes very steep for CH4/CO2 < 1. Comparison\nwith photochemical model calculations suggests that polymerizations of\ngas-phase hydrocarbons, such as polyynes and aromatics, cannot account for the\ngrowth rate of the organic film but that the addition reaction of CH3 radicals\nonto the organic film with the reaction probability around 10-2 can explain the\ngrowth rate.

More specifically, we analyze the BLASSO method which\nestimates a sparse measure (sum of Dirac masses) from randomized sub-sampled\nmeasurements. This is a \"continuous\", often called off-the-grid, extension of\nthe compressed sensing problem, where the $\\ell^1$ norm is replaced by the\ntotal variation of measures. This extension is appealing from a numerical\nperspective because it avoids to discretize the the space by some grid. But\nmore importantly, it makes explicit the geometry of the problem since the\npositions of the Diracs can now freely move over the parameter space. On a\nmethodological level, our contribution is to propose the Fisher geodesic\ndistance on this parameter space as the canonical metric to analyze\nsuper-resolution in a way which is invariant to reparameterization of this\nspace. Switching to the Fisher metric allows us to take into account\nmeasurement operators which are not translation invariant, which is crucial for\napplications such as Laplace inversion in imaging, Gaussian mixtures estimation\nand training of multilayer perceptrons with one hidden layer. On a theoretical\nlevel, our main contribution shows that if the Fisher distance between spikes\nis larger than a Rayleigh separation constant, then the BLASSO recovers in a\nstable way a stream of Diracs, provided that the number of measurements is\nproportional (up to log factors) to the number of Diracs. We measure the\nstability using an optimal transport distance constructed on top of the Fisher\ngeodesic distance.

Previous works\ndemonstrated that in the absence of axial confinement the steady liquid thread\nbecomes unstable due to an axisymmetric global mode for values of the flow\nrate, $Q$, below a certain critical value, $Q_c$, giving rise to oscillations\nof increasing amplitude that finally lead to a dripping regime (Sauter &\nBuggisch, J.

The linear stability analysis shows good\nagreement with our experiments, revealing that $Q_c$ increases monotonically\nwith $L$, reaching the semi-infinite jet asymptote for large values of $L$.\nMoreover, as $L$ decreases a quasi-static limit is reached, whereby $Q_c \\to 0$\nand the neutral conditions are given by a critical length determined by\nhydrostatics. Our experiments have also revealed the existence of a new regime\nintermediate between steady jetting and dripping, in which the thread reaches a\nlimit-cycle state without breakup. We thus show that there exist three possible\nstates depending on the values of the control parameters, namely steady\njetting, oscillatory jetting and dripping. For two different combinations of\nliquid viscosity, and injector radius, $R$, the boundaries separating these\nregimes have been determined in the $Q-L$ parameter plane, showing that steady\njetting exists for small enough values of $L$ or large enough values of $Q$,\ndripping prevails for small enough values of $Q$ or sufficiently large values\nof $L$, and oscillatory jetting takes place in an intermediate region whose\nsize increases with the liquid viscosity and decreases with $R$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 10:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

The prominent challenge is to\nmaintain high parallelization efficiency over a wide range of code sizes and\nchannel conditions, and different execution hardware. We ensure this with a\ndynamic strategy for choosing parallel execution parameters at run-time. We\nalso present a variant that trades off some decoding speed for significantly\nreduced memory requirement, with no loss to the decoder's error correction\nperformance. The increased throughput of our implementation and its ability to\nwork with less memory allow us to analyse larger codes and poorer channel\nconditions, and makes practical use of such codes more feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 11:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

In this paper we describe our approach to combining\nbusiness processes with business rules in order to integrate effectively single\nunits in an inter- or intra-organizational cooperation. Business rules\nrepresent the knowledge that an administration has about its business; with\nregard to this, they can express strategies, contracts and can influence not\nonly staff relations, but, finally, citizen relations, as well. In other words,\nbusiness rules are the core of an administration and affect either the business\nprocesses or the behaviours of the system participants. They are typically\nexpressed implicitly in business contracts and they are embedded within the\nsource code of many application modules. So a concise and declarative statement\nof business behaviour is converted into a set of programming instructions,\nwhich are spread widely throughout the whole information system. In this way,\nbusiness rules are difficult to change and keep consistent over the time. For\nthis reason, it is necessary to reengineer the system in order to logically and\nperhaps physically externalize rules from the application code. In our proposed\napproach, we describe a cooperation as a collection of tasks combined in\ncertain ways according to the organization logic specified by business rules.\nOur rule-driven methodology has the goal to make the business process design\nmore adaptable to the changes of internal or external environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 11:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

Most nitrogen is expected to be partitioned among atomic nitrogen,\nmolecular nitrogen (N2), and icy N-bearing molecules, such as ammonia (NH3) and\nN2.

In this paper,\nwe propose an indirect way to constrain the amount of atomic nitrogen in the\ncold gas of star-forming clouds, via deuteration in ammonia ice, the\n[ND2H/NH2D]/[NH2D/NH3] ratio. Using gas-ice astrochemical simulations, we show\nthat if atomic nitrogen remains as the primary reservoir of nitrogen during\ncold ice formation stages, the [ND2H/NH2D]/[NH2D/NH3] ratio is close to the\nstatistical value of 1/3 and lower than unity, whereas if atomic nitrogen is\nlargely converted into N-bearing molecules, the ratio should be larger than\nunity.

The case of two agents\nis investigated. Each agent is equipped with inertial sensors (accelerometer\nand gyroscope) and with a monocular camera. By using the monocular camera, each\nagent can observe the other agent. No additional camera observations (e.g., of\nexternal point features in the environment) are considered. All the inertial\nsensors are assumed to be affected by a bias. First, the entire observable\nstate is analytically derived. This state includes the absolute scale, the\nrelative velocity between the two agents, the three Euler angles that express\nthe rotation between the two agent frames and all the accelerometer and\ngyroscope biases. Second, the paper provides the extension of the closed-form\nsolution given in [19] (which holds for a single agent) to the aforementioned\ncooperative case. The impact of the presence of the bias on the performance of\nthis closed-form solution is investigated. As in the case of a single agent,\nthis performance is significantly sensitive to the presence of a bias on the\ngyroscope, while, the presence of a bias on the accelerometer is negligible.\nFinally, a simple and effective method to obtain the gyroscope bias is\nproposed. Extensive simulations clearly show that the proposed method is\nsuccessful.

It is well known\nthat the extremum seeking control loop, under certain mild conditions on the\ncontroller, has a stable stationary periodic solution in the vicinity of an\nextremum point of the steady-state input-output map of the plant. However, this\nis a local result only and this paper investigates whether this solution is\nnecessarily unique given that the underlying optimization problem is convex. We\nfirst derive a necessary condition that any stationary solution of the ESC loop\nmust satisfy. For plants in which the extremum point is due to a purely static\nnonlinearity, such as in Hammerstein or Wiener plants, the condition involves\nthe steady-state gradient. However, for more general plants the necessary\ncondition involves the phase lag of the locally linearized plant, indicating\nthe possible existence of solutions without any relationship to optimality.\nCombining the derived necessary condition with the existence of a local\nsolution close to the optimum, we employ bifurcation theory to trace out\nbranches of stationary solutions. We derive conditions on when these branches\nbifurcate, resulting in multiple stationary solutions. The results show that\ncyclic fold bifurcations may exist, resulting in the existence of multiple\nstationary period one solutions, of which only one is related to the optimality\nconditions. We illustrate the results through an example in which the\nconversion in a chemical reactor is optimized using ESC. We show that at least\nfive stationary solutions may exist simultaneously for realistic control\nparameters, and that several of these solutions are stable. One consequence of\nthe non-uniqueness is that one in general needs to start close to the optimum\nto ensure convergence to the near-optimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 13:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

In particular, the\ngeneration of reliable quantitative torque predictions for electro-orientation\nexperiments has been elusive. The traditional Laplace model approximates the\ncoated particle by an ellipsoid with a confocal ellipsoidal layer and solves\nLaplace's equation to produce convenient analytical predictions. However, due\nto the non-uniformity of the layer thickness around the ellipsoid, this method\ncan lead to incorrect torque predictions. Here we present a new theoretical\ndual-ellipsoid Laplace model that corrects the effect of the non-uniform layer\nthickness by calculating two layered ellipsoids, each accounting for the\ncorrect layer thickness along each relevant direction for the torque. Our model\ndescribes the electro-orientation of submerged lipid-coated graphitic\nmicro-particles in the presence of an alternating current (AC) electric field\nand is valid for ellipsoids with moderate aspect ratios and coated with thin\nshells. It is one of the first models to generate correct quantitative electric\ntorque predictions.

The\nresults show how the lipid shell changes the overall electrical properties of\nthe micro-flakes so that the torque is low at low frequencies and increases at\nhigher frequencies into the MHz regime.

Liquefaction is definedhere as the transition from a rigid\nstate, in which the granular soil layer supports structures placed on its\nsurface, toa fluidlike state, in which structures placed initially on the\nsurface sink to their isostatic depth within the granularlayer.We suggest a\nsimple theoretical model for soil liquefaction and show that buoyancy caused by\nthe presence ofwater inside a granular medium has a dramatic influence on the\nstability of an intruder resting at the surface of themedium.We confirm this\nhypothesis by comparison with laboratory experiments and discrete-element\nnumericalsimulations. The external excitation representing ground motion during\nearthquakes is simulated via horizontalsinusoidal oscillations of controlled\nfrequency and amplitude. In the experiments, we use particles only\nslightlydenser than water, which as predicted theoretically increases the\neffect of liquefaction and allows clear depth-of-sinkingmeasurements. In the\nsimulations, a micromechanical model simulates grains using molecular\ndynamicswith friction between neighbors. The effect of the fluid is captured by\ntaking into account buoyancy effects onthe grains when they are immersed. We\nshow that the motion of an intruder inside a granular medium is mainlydependent\non the peak acceleration of the ground motion and establish a phase diagram for\nthe conditions underwhich liquefaction happens, depending on the soil bulk\ndensity, friction properties, presence of water, and peak acceleration of the\nimposed large-scale soil vibrations.We establish that in liquefaction\nconditions, most cases relaxtoward an equilibrium position following an\nexponential in time.We also show that the equilibrium position itself,for most\nliquefaction regimes, corresponds to the isostatic equilibrium of the intruder\ninside a medium of effectivedensity.

Using wide residual networks as our main\nbaseline, our approach simplifies existing methods that binarize weights by\napplying the sign function in training; we apply scaling factors for each layer\nwith constant unlearned values equal to the layer-specific standard deviations\nused for initialization. For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and models with\n1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve\nerror rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively.

For the problem, a graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge\nlengths and an integer $k$ are given and a center set $C\\subseteq V$ needs to\nbe chosen such that $|C|\\leq k$. The aim is to minimize the maximum distance of\nany vertex in the graph to the closest center. This problem arises in many\napplications of logistics, and thus it is natural to consider inputs that model\ntransportation networks. Such inputs are often assumed to be planar graphs, low\ndoubling metrics, or bounded highway dimension graphs. For each of these\nmodels, parameterized approximation algorithms have been shown to exist. We\ncomplement these results by proving that the $k$-Center problem is W[1]-hard on\nplanar graphs of constant doubling dimension, where the parameter is the\ncombination of the number of centers $k$, the highway dimension $h$, and the\npathwidth $p$. Moreover, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis there is no\n$f(k,p,h)\\cdot n^{o(p+\\sqrt{k+h})}$ time algorithm for any computable function\n$f$. Thus it is unlikely that the optimum solution to $k$-Center can be found\nefficiently, even when assuming that the input graph abides to all of the above\nmodels for transportation networks at once!\n  Additionally we give a simple parameterized $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm for inputs of doubling dimension $d$ with runtime\n$(k^k/\\varepsilon^{O(kd)})\\cdot n^{O(1)}$.

We\ndemonstrate the importance of taking into account the Control System (CS) for a\nfair assessment of energy flows and consumptions. We model the energy\nconsumption and power to transport an ion by a STA protocol in a multisegmented\nPaul trap. The ion is driven by an externally controlled, moving harmonic\noscillator. Even if no net ion- energy is gained at destination, setting the\ntime-dependent control parameters is a macroscopic operation that costs energy\nand results in energy dissipation for the short time scales implied by the\nintrinsically fast STA processes. The potential minimum is displaced by\nmodulating the voltages on control (dc) electrodes. A secondary effect of the\nmodulation, usually ignored as it does not affect the ion dynamics, is the\ntime- dependent energy shift of the potential minimum. The non trivial part of\nthe energy consumption is due to the electromotive forces to set the electrode\nvoltages through the low-pass filters required to preserve the electronic noise\nfrom decohering the ion's motion. The results for the macroscopic CS (the Paul\ntrap) are compared to the microscopic power and energy of the ion alone.\nSimilarities are found -and may be used quantitatively to minimize costs- only\nwhen the CS-dependent energy shift of the harmonic oscillator is included in\nthe ion energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 08:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The differences in the interior could be useful for\ncharacterizing the projectile that formed a given crater on the basis of\ngeophysical observations and potentially offer a possibility to help constrain\nthe demographics of the ancient impactor population.

The X-ray spectra are modeled with a power-law component\nabsorbed by Galactic column density with, in some cases, a contribution from\nthermal extended gas. The X-ray photons are likely produced by the jet as\nattested by the observed correlation between X-ray (2-10 keV) and radio (5 GHz)\nluminosities, similar to FRIs. The estimated Eddington-scaled luminosities\nindicate a low accretion rate. Overall, we find that the X-ray properties of\nFR0s are indistinguishable from those of FRIs, thus adding another similarity\nbetween AGN associated with compact and extended radio sources. A comparison\nbetween FR0s and low luminosity BL Lacs, rules out important beaming effects in\nthe X-ray emission of the compact radio galaxies. FR0s have different X-ray\nproperties with respect to young radio sources (e.g. GPS/CSS sources),\ngenerally characterized by higher X-ray luminosities and more complex spectra.\nIn conclusion, the paucity of extended radio emission in FR0s is probably\nrelated to the intrinsic properties of their jets that prevent the formation of\nextended structures, and/or to intermittent activity of their engines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

Specifically, we give an expression for the expected distribution of\ndrift between transmitter and receiver due to synchronization errors. We\ndetermine an appropriate choice for state space limits based on the drift\nprobability distribution. In turn, we obtain an expression for the decoder\ncomplexity under given channel conditions in terms of the state space limits\nused. For a given state space, we also give a number of optimizations that\nreduce the algorithm complexity with no further loss of decoder performance. We\nalso show how the MAP decoder can be used in the absence of known frame\nboundaries, and demonstrate that an appropriate choice of decoder parameters\nallows the decoder to approach the performance when frame boundaries are known,\nat the expense of some increase in complexity. Finally, we express some\nexisting constructions as TVB codes, comparing performance with published\nresults, and showing that improved performance is possible by taking advantage\nof the flexibility of TVB codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

In the two decades since their introduction,\nboth have contributed significantly to insights into protein molecular\nmechanisms and function. However, despite a shared purpose of these approaches,\nthe topological nature of rigidity analysis, and thereby the absence of motion\nmodes, has impeded a direct comparison. Here, we present an alternative,\nkinematic approach to rigidity analysis, which circumvents these drawbacks. We\nintroduce a novel protein hydrogen bond network spectral decomposition, which\nprovides an orthonormal basis for collective motions modulated by non-covalent\ninteractions, analogous to the eigenspectrum of normal modes, and decomposes\nproteins into rigid clusters identical to those from topological rigidity. Our\nkinematic flexibility analysis bridges topological rigidity theory and ENM, and\nenables a detailed analysis of motion modes obtained from both approaches. Our\nanalysis reveals that collectivity of protein motions, reported by the Shannon\nentropy, is significantly lower for rigidity theory versus normal mode\napproaches. Strikingly, kinematic flexibility analysis suggests that the\nhydrogen bonding network encodes a protein-fold specific, spatial hierarchy of\nmotions, which goes nearly undetected in ENM. This hierarchy reveals distinct\nmotion regimes that rationalize protein stiffness changes observed from\nexperiment and molecular dynamics simulations. A formal expression for changes\nin free energy derived from the spectral decomposition indicates that motions\nacross nearly 40% of modes obey enthalpy-entropy compensation. Taken together,\nour analysis suggests that hydrogen bond networks have evolved to modulate\nprotein structure and dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 06:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Currently, we have discovered hundreds of earth-sized\nplanets, several of them within the habitable zone of their star. In the coming\nyears, the efforts will concentrate in the characterization of these planets\nand their atmospheres to try to detect the presence of biosignatures. However,\neven if we discovered a second Earth, it is very unlikely that it would present\na stage of evolution similar to the present-day Earth. Our planet has been far\nfrom static since its formation about 4.5 Ga ago; on the contrary, during this\ntime, it has undergone multiple changes in it's atmospheric composition, it's\ntemperature structure, it's continental distribution, and even changes in the\nforms of life that inhabit it. All these changes have affected the global\nproperties of Earth as seen from an astronomical distance. Thus, it is of\ninterest not only to characterize the observables of the Earth as it is today,\nbut also at different epochs. Here we review the detectability of the Earth's\nglobally-averaged properties over time. This includes atmospheric composition\nand biosignatures, and surface properties that can be interpreted as sings of\nhabitability (bioclues). The resulting picture is that truly unambiguous\nbiosignatures are only detectable for about 1/4 of the Earth's history. The\nrest of the time we rely on detectable bioclues that can only establish an\nstatistical likelihood for the presence of life on a given planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 09:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Additionally,\nquantitative and qualitative analyses of these language embeddings can tell us\nhow language similarities are encoded in NLP models for tasks at different\ntypological levels.

This study investigates how Lean internal startup facilitates\nsoftware product innovation in large companies and identifies its enablers and\ninhibitors. A multiple case study approach is followed in the investigation.\nTwo software product innovation projects from two large companies are examined,\nusing a conceptual framework that is based on the method-in-action framework\nand extended with the previously developed Lean-Internal Corporate Venture\nmodel. Seven face-to-face in-depth interviews of the employees with different\nroles are conducted. Within-case analysis and cross-case comparison are applied\nto draw the findings from the cases. A generic process flow summarises the\ncommon key processes of Lean internal startups. The findings suggest that an\ninternal startup that is initiated management or employees faces different\nchallenges. A list of enablers of applying Lean startup in large companies are\nidentified, including top management support and cross-functional team. Both\ncases face different inhibitors due to the different process of inception,\nobjective of the team and type of the product. Our contributions are threefold.\nFirst, this study is one of the first attempt to investigate the use of Lean\nstartup approach in large companies empirically. Second, the study shows the\npotential of the method-in-action framework to investigate the Lean startup\napproach in non-startup context. The third is a general process of Lean\ninternal startup and the evidence of the enablers and inhibitors of\nimplementing it, which are both theory-informed and empirically grounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Today, randomness is\nfundamental to security and cryptographic systems, as well as safeguarding\nprivacy. A key challenge with random number generators is that it is hard to\nensure that their outputs are unpredictable. For a random number generator\nbased on a physical process, such as a noisy classical system or an elementary\nquantum measurement, a detailed model describing the underlying physics is\nrequired to assert unpredictability. Such a model must make a number of\nassumptions that may not be valid, thereby compromising the integrity of the\ndevice. However, it is possible to exploit the phenomenon of quantum\nnonlocality with a loophole-free Bell test to build a random number generator\nthat can produce output that is unpredictable to any adversary limited only by\ngeneral physical principles. With recent technological developments, it is now\npossible to carry out such a loophole-free Bell test. Here we present certified\nrandomness obtained from a photonic Bell experiment and extract 1024 random\nbits uniform to within $10^{-12}$. These random bits could not have been\npredicted within any physical theory that prohibits superluminal signaling and\nallows one to make independent measurement choices. To certify and quantify the\nrandomness, we describe a new protocol that is optimized for apparatuses\ncharacterized by a low per-trial violation of Bell inequalities. We thus\nenlisted an experimental result that fundamentally challenges the notion of\ndeterminism to build a system that can increase trust in random sources. In the\nfuture, random number generators based on loophole-free Bell tests may play a\nrole in increasing the security and trust of our cryptographic systems and\ninfrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 22:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

For massive\ndata sets, kriging is computationally intensive, both in terms of CPU time and\nmemory, and so fixed rank kriging has been proposed as a solution. The method\nhowever still involves operations on large matrices, so we develop an\nalteration to this method by utilizing the approximations made in fixed rank\nkriging combined with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and sparse\nmatrix methodology. Experiments show that our methodology can provide\nadditional gains in computational efficiency over fixed-rank kriging without\nloss of accuracy in prediction. The methodology is applied to climate data\narchived by the United States National Climate Data Center, with very good\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 03:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 12:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}
