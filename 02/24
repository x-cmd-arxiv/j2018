This paper is an exploration of how\nmastery learning plays out in practice, based on log data from a large\nrandomized effectiveness trial of the Cognitive Tutor Algebra I (CTAI)\ncurriculum. We find that students frequently progressed from CTAI sections they\nwere working on without demonstrating mastery and worked units out of order.\nMoreover, these behaviors were substantially more common in the second year of\nthe study, in which the CTAI effect was significantly larger. We explore the\nvarious ways students departed from the official CTAI curriculum, focusing on\nheterogeneity between years, states, schools, and students. The paper concludes\nwith an observational study of the effect on post-test scores of teachers\nreassigning students out of their current sections before they mastered the\nrequisite skills, finding that reassignment appears to lowers posttest\nscores--a finding that is fairly resilient to confounding from omitted\ncovariates--but that the effect varies substantially between classrooms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 16:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

The spatial density distribution of the interstellar gas is a\nvital element for all these studies. So far models have employed the 2D\ncylindrically symmetric geometry, but their accuracy is well behind that of the\navailable data. In this paper, 3D spatial density models for the neutral and\nmolecular hydrogen are constructed based on empirical model fitting to gas\nline-survey data. The developed density models incorporate spiral arms and\naccount for the warping of the disk, and the increasing gas scale height with\nradial distance from the Galactic center. They are employed together with the\nGALPROP CR propagation code to investigate how the new 3D gas models affect\ncalculations of CR propagation and high-energy gamma-ray intensity maps. The\ncalculations made reveal non-trivial features that are directly related to the\nnew gas models. The best-fit values for propagation model parameters employing\n3D gas models are presented and they differ significantly from the values\nderived with the 2D gas density models that have been widely used. The\ncombination of 3D CR and gas density models provide a more realistic basis for\nthe interpretation of non-thermal emissions from the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

As a result, 29400 source\ncandidates were selected. Then, a multi-frequency analysis was performed using\nthe Matrix Filters methodology at the position of these objects, and flux\ndensities and errors were calculated for all of them in the nine Planck\nchannels. The present catalogue is the first unbiased, full-sky catalogue of\nsynchrotron-dominated sources published at millimetre and submillimetre\nwavelengths and constitutes a powerful database for statistical studies of\nnon-thermal extragalactic sources, whose emission is dominated by the central\nactive galactic nucleus. Together with the full multi-frequency catalogue, we\nalso define the Bright Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal Sources\nPCNTb, where only those objects with a S/N>4 at both 30 and 143 GHz were\nselected. In this catalogue 1146 compact sources are detected outside the\nadopted Planck GAL070 mask; thus, these sources constitute a highly reliable\nsample of extragalactic radio sources.

These microbubbles consist of\na gas core encapsulated by a layer of protein or lipid to stabilize them\nagainst early dissolution in the bloodstream. Contrast agents, in the presence\nof ultrasound, can also help facilitate the uptake of drugs and genes in to\ndesired cells through the process called sonoporation. Sonoporation is the\ntemporarily rupture of cell membranes in the presence of ultrasound. In this\nwork, we have studied the contrast agent near a rigid wall (assumed as a cell\nmembrane with high elastic modulus) in the presence of ultrasound using\nboundary element method. The contrast agent forms non-symmetrical high velocity\nmicrojet at the last stage of the collapse phase. The microjet and the adjacent\nsurrounding fluid move toward the rigid wall with a very high velocity. This\nhigh velocity fluid impinges the wall and spreads radially along it. This will\ngenerate high velocity gradient on the wall which gives rise to shear stress\nresulting in the perforation of cell membrane. The encapsulation of the\nmicrobubble can be assumed as an interface with an infinitesimal thickness.\nThere are several models to simulate the interface. In this study, the\nencapsulation is simulated with two models; viscoelastic model with\nexponentially varying elasticity (EEM) and Marmottant model. In this research,\nwe have studied the effect of different parameters on the dynamics of the\ncontrast microbubble, the induced shear stress on the wall due to its collapse,\nand the velocity and pressure fields surrounding the contrast microbubble, to\nbetter understand sonoporation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

However, the problem of finding all the Pareto-optimal routes in\nWMHNs is classified as NP-hard, since the number of legitimate routes increases\nexponentially, as the nodes proliferate. Quantum Computing offers an attractive\nframework of rendering the Pareto-optimal routing problem tractable. In this\ncontext, a pair of quantum-assisted algorithms have been proposed, namely the\nNon-Dominated Quantum Optimization (NDQO) and the Non-Dominated Quantum\nIterative Optimization (NDQIO).

In\nthis Letter we present a new method to constrain $b(k)$ by using the\ncross-correlation between the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing signal\nand galaxy maps ($C_\\ell^{\\rm \\kappa g}$) using a simple but theoretically\nwell-motivated parametrization for $b(k)$.

We\ndetect a non-zero scale-dependence at moderate significance, which suggests\nthat a proper modeling of $b(k)$ is necessary in order to reduce the impact of\nnon-linearities and minimize the corresponding systematics.

CIRS observations suggest a different meridional\ndistribution for these two species, difficult to reconcile with their\nphotochemical histories, which are thought to be coupled to the methane\nphotolysis. While the C2H2 abundance decreases with latitude, C2H6 becomes more\nabundant at high latitudes. A new 2D (latitude-altitude) seasonal photochemical\nmodel is developed to study whether the addition of stratospheric transport\nprocesses, such as meridional diffusion and advection, can explain the\nlatitudinal behavior of C2H2 and C2H6. C2H2 observations are fairly well\nreproduced without meridional diffusion. Adding meridional diffusion to the\nmodel provides an improved agreement with the C2H6 observations by flattening\nits meridional distribution, but degrades the fit to the C2H2 distribution.\nMeridional diffusion alone cannot produce the observed increase with latitude\nof C2H6. When adding advective transport between 30 mbar and 0.01 mbar, with\nupwelling winds at the equator and downwelling winds at high latitudes, we can\nreproduce the C2H6 abundance increase with latitude. However, the fit to the\nC2H2 distribution is degraded. The strength of the advective winds needed to\nreproduce the C2H6 abundances is very sensitive to the value of the meridional\neddy diffusion coefficient.

CARDs are\nsignificantly more expressive than Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)\nas they support operations that can conflict with each other. Introducing\nconflicting operations typically brings the need to block an operation in at\nleast some executions, leading to difficulties in programming and reasoning\nabout correctness, as well as potential inefficiencies in implementation.\n  The salient aspect of CARDs is that they allow ease of programming and\nreasoning about programs comparable to CRDTs, while enabling algorithmic\ninference of conflicts so that an operation is blocked only when necessary. The\nkey idea is to have a language that allows associating with each operation a\ntwo-state predicate called {\\em consistency guard} that relates the state of\nthe replica on which the operation is executing to a global state (which is\nnever computed). The consistency guards bring three advantages. First, a\nprogrammer developing an operation needs only to choose a consistency guard\nthat states what the operation will rely on. In particular, they do not need to\nconsider the operation conflicts with other operation. This allows purely {\\em\nmodular reasoning}. Second, we show that consistency guard allow reducing the\ncomplexity of reasoning needed to prove invariants that hold as CARD operations\nare executing. The reason is that consistency guard allow reducing the\nreasoning about concurrency among operations to purely {\\em sequential\nreasoning}.

A recent approach for finding a common representation of\nthe two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015),\nwhich attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target\nfeature distributions in some feature space. However, domain adversarial\ntraining faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function\nhas high-capacity, then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint, 2)\nin non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform\nwell in both the source and target domains), training the model to do well on\nthe source domain hurts performance on the target domain.

The spongy nature of the sacrificial PS-b-P2VP stamps\nsupported formation of adhesive contact to the counterpart surfaces and the\nrupture of the contact elements during stamp retraction. The submicron\nPS-b-P2VP dots generated by sacrificial stamping can be further functionalized,\nexamples include loading submicron PS-b-P2VP dots with dyes and attachment of\ngold nanoparticles to their outer surfaces. The arrays of submicron PS-b-P2VP\ndots can be integrated into setups for advanced optical microscopy, total\ninternal reflection fluorescence microscopy or Raman microscopy. Arrays of\nnanostructured submicron block copolymer dots may represent a preconcentration\nplatform for locally resolved sensing and locally resolved monitoring of\ncellular interactions or might be used as microreactor arrays in lab-on-chip\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 22:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-26"}

In this paper, we present a modular framework for tracking multiple\nobjects (vehicles), capable of accepting object proposals from different sensor\nmodalities (vision and range) and a variable number of sensors, to produce\ncontinuous object tracks. This work is a generalization of the MDP framework\nfor MOT, with some key extensions - First, we track objects across multiple\ncameras and across different sensor modalities. This is done by fusing object\nproposals across sensors accurately and efficiently. Second, the objects of\ninterest (targets) are tracked directly in the real world. This is a departure\nfrom traditional techniques where objects are simply tracked in the image\nplane. Doing so allows the tracks to be readily used by an autonomous agent for\nnavigation and related tasks.\n  To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we test it on real world highway\ndata collected from a heavily sensorized testbed capable of capturing\nfull-surround information. We demonstrate that our framework is well-suited to\ntrack objects through entire maneuvers around the ego-vehicle, some of which\ntake more than a few minutes to complete.

We evaluated clusters on: 1) correspondence to\ngold standards generated by certified diabetes educators (CDEs) for 3\nparticipants; 2) face validity, rated by CDEs, and 3) impact on CDEs' ability\nto identify patterns for another 3 participants. Results: Gold standard (GS)\nincluded 9 patterns across 3 participants. Of these, all 9 were re-discovered\nusing HC: 4 GS patterns were consistent with patterns identified by HC (over\n50% of meals in a cluster followed the pattern); another 5 were included as\nsub-groups in broader clusers. 50% (9/18) of clusters were rated over 3 on\n5-point Likert scale for validity, significance, and being actionable.

Using this\nframework, we study the performance of three backhaul bandwidth (BW) partition\nstrategies: 1) equal partition: when all SBSs obtain equal share of the\nbackhaul BW; 2) instantaneous load-based partition: when the backhaul BW share\nof an SBS is proportional to its instantaneous load; and 3) average load-based\npartition: when the backhaul BW share of an SBS is proportional to its average\nload. Our analysis shows that depending on the choice of the partition\nstrategy, there exists an optimal split of access and backhaul BW for which the\nrate coverage is maximized.

Pixel-level class-semantic textons are first learnt by generating two\nindividual sets of bag-of-word visual dictionaries from color and filter-bank\ntexture features separately for each object class using manually cropped\ntraining data.

We\npresent a summary of recently published and newly produced results which\ndemonstrate various possibilities of extending the PT symmetry to arbitrarily\nlarge values of the gain-loss coefficient. First, we recapitulate the analysis\nwhich demonstrates a possibility of the restoration of the PT symmetry and,\nmoreover, complete avoidance of the breaking in a photonic waveguide of a\nsubwavelength width. The analysis is based on the Maxwell's equations, instead\nof the usual paraxial approximation. Next, we review a recently proposed\npossibility to construct stable one-dimensional (1D) PT-symmetric solitons in a\nparaxial model with arbitrarily large values of the gain-loss coefficient,\nprovided that the self-trapping of the solitons is induced by self-defocusing\ncubic nonlinearity, whose local strength grows sufficiently fast from the\ncenter to periphery. The model admits a particular analytical solution for the\nfundamental soliton, and provides full stability for families of fundamental\nand dipole solitons. Finally, we report new results for unbreakable\nPT-symmetric solitons in 2D extensions of the 1D model: one with a quasi-1D\nmodulation profile of the local gain-loss coefficient, and another with the\nfully-2D modulation. These settings admit particular analytical solutions for\n2D solitons, while generic soliton families are found in a numerical form. The\nquasi-1D modulation profile gives rise to a stable family of single-peak 2D\nsolitons.

One of the known rationales is the loss of\nselection pressure which leads to the selected parents not generating promising\noffspring towards Pareto-optimal front with diversity. Estimation of\ndistribution algorithms sample new solutions with a probabilistic model built\nfrom the statistics extracting over the existing solutions so as to mitigate\nthe adverse impact of genetic operators. In this paper, an improved\nregularity-based estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed to\neffectively tackle unconstrained many-objective optimization problems. In the\nproposed algorithm, \\emph{diversity repairing mechanism} is utilized to mend\nthe areas where need non-dominated solutions with a closer proximity to the\nPareto-optimal front. Then \\emph{favorable solutions} are generated by the\nmodel built from the regularity of the solutions surrounding a group of\nrepresentatives. These two steps collectively enhance the selection pressure\nwhich gives rise to the superior convergence of the proposed algorithm. In\naddition, dimension reduction technique is employed in the decision space to\nspeed up the estimation search of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we present a new dataset collected in real-world to\nfacilitate the research in DRL based visual navigation. Our dataset includes 3D\nreconstruction for real-world scenes as well as densely captured real 2D images\nfrom the scenes. It provides high-quality visual inputs with real-world scene\ncomplexity to the robot at dense grid locations. We further study and benchmark\none recent DRL based navigation algorithm and present our attempts and thoughts\non improving its generalizability to unseen test targets in the scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 09:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

The sheaf cohomologies of these line\nbundles are found to encode the chiral and anti-chiral localised zero modes in\nthis compactification. Therefore, it is of prime interest to compute these\nsheaf cohomologies. Unfortunately, the line bundles in question are in general\nnon-pullback line bundles.

In the zero self-propulsion\nlimit, our model reduces to the equilibrium $XY$ model with quenched disorder,\nwhile for the clean system, it is similar to the Vicsek model for polar flock.\nWe note that a small amount of the quenched rotators destroys the long-range\norder usually noted in the clean SPPs. The system shows a quasi-long range\norder state upto some moderate density of the rotators. On further increment in\nthe density of rotators, the system shows a continuous transition from the\nquasi-long-range order to disorder state at some critical density of rotators.\nOur linearized hydrodynamic calculation predicts anisotropic higher order\nfluctuation in two-point structure factors for density and velocity fields of\nthe SPPs.

ONE is unusual in the sense that it is trained in various\nways, e.g., by black box optimization / reinforcement learning / artificial\nevolution as well as supervised / unsupervised learning. For example, ONE may\nlearn through neuroevolution to control a robot through environment-changing\nactions, and learn through unsupervised gradient descent to predict future\ninputs and vector-valued reward signals as suggested in 1990. User-given tasks\ncan be defined through extra goal-defining input patterns, also proposed in\n1990. Suppose ONE has already learned many skills. Now a copy of ONE can be\nre-trained to learn a new skill, e.g., through neuroevolution without a\nteacher.

Now the\nNewtonian approximation is a valid short distance approximation to general\nrelativity, and Schrodinger-Newton equation can be obtained as a\nnon-relativistic semi-classical limit of such a theory, we will analyze the\nshort distance modification of Schrodinger-Newton equation from an intrinsic\nminimal length in the geometry of spacetime. As an optical analog of the\nSchrodinger-Newton equation has been constructed, it is possible to optically\nrealize this system. So, this system is important, and we will numerical\nanalyze the solutions for this system. It will be observed that the usual\nRunge-Kutta method cannot be used to analyze this system. However, we will use\na propose and use a new numerical method, which we will call as the two step\nRunge-Kutta method, for analyzing this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 02:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

A simple\nrescaling of these data, free of any adjustable parameters, shows that this\nanomaly exhibits a universal, temperature- ($T$) independent form. According to\nthis, the differential conductance is approximately constant at small voltages\n($V<k_BT/e$), while at larger voltages it increases logarithmically with the\napplied bias, reflecting a quenching of the quantum corrections. For\ntheoretical insight into the origins of this behavior, we formulate a model for\nweak-localization in the presence of nonlinear transport.
