In particular, we focus on the independent cascade\nmodel with the possibility of adaptively selecting seed nodes in multiple\nphases based on the observed diffusion in preceding phases, and conduct a\ndetailed simulation study on real-world network datasets and various values of\nseeding budgets. We first present a negative result that more phases do not\nguarantee a better spread, however the adaptability advantage of more phases\ngenerally leads to a better spread in practice, as observed on real-world\ndatasets. We study how diffusing in multiple phases affects the mean and\nstandard deviation of the distribution representing the extent of diffusion. We\nthen study how the number of phases impacts the effectiveness of multiphase\ndiffusion, how the diffusion progresses phase-by-phase, and what is an optimal\nway to split the total seeding budget across phases. Our experiments suggest a\nsignificant gain when we move from single phase to two phases, and an\nappreciable gain when we further move to three phases, but the marginal gain\nthereafter is usually not very significant. Our main conclusion is that, given\nthe number of phases, an optimal way to split the budget across phases is such\nthat the number of nodes influenced in each phase is almost the same.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 16:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Yet, the deviations of the potential\nfrom the Keplerian one, due to the enclosed stellar mass and general\nrelativity, will cause the stellar orbits to precess. Moreover, as a result of\nthe finite number of stars, small deviations of the potential from spherical\nsymmetry induce residual torques that can change the stars' angular momentum\nfaster than the standard two-body relaxation. The combination of these two\neffects drives a stochastic evolution of orbital angular momentum, a process\nnamed \"resonant relaxation\". Owing to recent developments in the description of\nthe relaxation of self-gravitating systems, we can now fully describe scalar\nresonant relaxation (relaxation of the magnitude of the angular momentum) as a\ndiffusion process. In this framework, the potential fluctuations due to the\ncomplex orbital motion of the stars are described by a random correlated noise,\nwhose statistical properties are fully characterized by the stars' mean field\nmotion. On long timescales, the cluster can be regarded as a diffusive system,\nwhose diffusion coefficients depend explicitly on the mean field stellar\ndistribution through the properties of the noise.

Since then, the fate of D/Lexell has attracted interest from\nthe scientific community, and now we revisit this long-standing question. We\ninvestigate the dynamical evolution of D/Lexell based on a set of orbits\nrecalculated using the observations made by Charles Messier, the comet's\ndiscoverer, and find that there is a $98\\%$ chance that D/Lexell remains in the\nSolar System by the year of 2000.

As a\nresult, performance overheads, maintenance costs, and false positive rates\ninduced by the different mitigations accumulate, culminating in an outdated,\ninefficient, and costly security solution.\n  We advocate for a new kind of tunable framework on which to base security\nmechanisms. This new framework enables a more reactive approach to security\nallowing us to optimize the deployment of security mechanisms based on the\ncurrent state of attacks.

The main application of twisted compact Calabi-Yau\nring spectra that we will study is to describe, prove, and explain a certain\nduality phenomenon in string topology. This is a duality between the manifold\nstring topology of Chas-Sullivan and the Lie group string topology of\nChataur-Menichi. This will extend and generalize work of Gruher. Then,\ngeneralizing work of the first author and Jones, we show how the gauge group of\nthe principal bundle acts on this compact Calabi-Yau structure, and compute\nsome explicit examples.

We use trace distance as a measure of\ndistinguishability and obtain the maximum distinguishability for some classes\nof states, analytically. Using the optimum measurement that gives the most\ndistinguishable steered states, we extract quantum correlation of the state and\ncompare the result with the quantum discord. It is shown that there are some\nimportant classes of states for which the most demolition happens exactly at\nthe most distinguished steered points.

The knowledge of what is in front\nof the robot is, for example, relevant for navigation, manipulation, or\nplanning. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel of an image with a class\nlabel and thus provides a detailed semantic annotation of the surroundings to\nthe robot. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are popular methods for\naddressing this type of problem. The available software for training and the\nintegration of CNNs for real robots, however, is quite fragmented and often\ndifficult to use for non-experts, despite the availability of several\nhigh-quality open-source frameworks for neural network implementation and\ntraining. In this paper, we propose a tool called Bonnet, which addresses this\nfragmentation problem by building a higher abstraction that is specific for the\nsemantic segmentation task. It provides a modular approach to simplify the\ntraining of a semantic segmentation CNN independently of the used dataset and\nthe intended task. Furthermore, we also address the deployment on a real\nrobotic platform. Thus, we do not propose a new CNN approach in this paper.\nInstead, we provide a stable and easy-to-use tool to make this technology more\napproachable in the context of autonomous systems. In this sense, we aim at\nclosing a gap between computer vision research and its use in robotics\nresearch. We provide an open-source codebase for training and deployment.

The\ndynamic mode decomposition (DMD) technique is used to analyze the convergence\nprocess of steady flow field according to the solution vectors from the\nprevious time steps. Unlike the traditional multigrid method, we project the\nflowfield solutions from the physical space into the modal space, and truncate\nall the high-frequency modes but only the first-order mode are retained based\non the DMD analysis. The real solutions in the physical space can be obtained\nsimply by the inverse transformation from the modal space. The developed MMG\nmethod ingeniously avoids the complicated process of coarsening computational\nmesh, and does not need to make any change for the grid in physical space.\nTherefore, it is very convenient to be applied to any numerical schemes with\njust little change for the flow solver, which is also suitable for unstructured\ngrids and easy for parallel computing. Several typical test cases have been\nused to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which demonstrates\nthat the MMG can dramatically reduce the number of iterative steps for the\ndifferent mesh types, different accuracy of spatial discretization and\ndifferent time-marching schemes. The method is 3 to 6 times faster than the\noriginal method while ensuring the computational accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 07:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

A commonly used method is to collect feedback from customers by\neither aggressively reaching out to them or by passively hearing from them.\nHowever, it is believed that there are a large number of customers who have\nunpleasant experiences and never speak out.

We\nshow that self-similar solutions always exists in the sub-critical case, while\nthe existence of such self-similar solution in the critical case depends on the\ngap between the decaying drifts for each of the components. For this, we study\nthe conditions for existence/non existence of solutions for the corresponding\nLiouville's systems, which, in turn, is related to the existence/non existence\nof minimizers to a corresponding Free Energy functional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 09:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

This study first systematically analyses the reasons for the\ndeficiency of the traditional GEDA, then tries to enhance its performance by\nexploiting its evolution direction, and finally develops a new GEDA variant\nnamed EDA2. Instead of only utilizing some good solutions produced in the\ncurrent generation when estimating the Gaussian model, EDA2 preserves a certain\nnumber of high-quality solutions generated in previous generations into an\narchive and takes advantage of these historical solutions to assist estimating\nthe covariance matrix of Gaussian model. By this means, the evolution direction\ninformation hidden in the archive is naturally integrated into the estimated\nmodel which in turn can guide EDA2 towards more promising solution regions.\nMoreover, the new estimation method significantly reduces the population size\nof EDA2 since it needs fewer individuals in the current population for model\nestimation.

Given an application domain, a\nsystem designer or supervisory operator must choose an appropriate system or\nalgorithm respectively that will enable them to achieve their goals while\nsatisfying mission constraints (e.g. bandwidth, energy, time limits). In this\npaper, we compare representative swarm and general multi-robot algorithms in\ntwo application domains - navigation and dynamic area coverage - with respect\nto several metrics (e.g. completion time, distance trav- elled). Our objective\nis to characterize each class of algorithms to inform offline system design\ndecisions by engineers or online algorithm selection decisions by supervisory\noperators. Our contributions are (a) an empirical performance comparison of\nrepresentative swarm and general multi-robot algorithms in two application\ndomains, (b) a comparative analysis of the algorithms based on the theory of\ninformation invariants, which provides a theoretical characterization supported\nby our empirical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 12:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

An $n$-fold integer program (IP) has a\nhighly uniform block structured constraint matrix. Hemmecke, Onn, and Romanchuk\n[Math. Programming, 2013] showed an algorithm with runtime $a^{O(rst + r^2s)}\nn^3$, where $a$ is the largest coefficient, $r,s$, and $t$ are dimensions of\nblocks of the constraint matrix and $n$ is the total dimension of the IP; thus,\nan algorithm efficient if the blocks are of small size and with small\ncoefficients. The algorithm works by iteratively improving a feasible solution\nwith augmenting steps, and $n$-fold IPs have the special property that\naugmenting steps are guaranteed to exist in a not-too-large neighborhood.\n  We have implemented the algorithm and learned the following along the way.\nThe original algorithm is practically unusable, but we discover a series of\nimprovements which make its evaluation possible. Crucially, we observe that a\ncertain constant in the algorithm can be treated as a tuning parameter, which\nyields an efficient heuristic (essentially searching in a\nsmaller-than-guaranteed neighborhood). Furthermore, the algorithm uses an\noverly expensive strategy to find a \"best\" step, while finding only an\n\"approximatelly best\" step is much cheaper, yet sufficient for quick\nconvergence. Using this insight, we improve the asymptotic dependence on $n$\nfrom $n^3$ to $n^2 \\log n$.\n  We show that decreasing the tuning parameter initially leads to an increased\nnumber of iterations needed for convergence and eventually to getting stuck in\nlocal optima, as expected.

Our main result is a\nde Finetti-type representation of random exchangeable interval hypergraphs on\n$\\mathbb{N}$ (EIHs): the law of every EIH can be obtained by sampling from some\nrandom compact subset $K$ of the triangle $\\{(x,y):0\\leq x\\leq y\\leq 1\\}$ at\niid uniform positions $U_1,U_2,\\dots$, in the sense that, restricted to the\nnode set $[n]:=\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ every non-singleton edge is of the form\n$e=\\{i\\in[n]:x<U_i<y\\}$ for some $(x,y)\\in K$. We obtain this result via the\nstudy of a related class of stochastic objects: erased-interval processes\n(EIPs). These are certain transient Markov chains\n$(I_n,\\eta_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ such that $I_n$ is an interval hypergraph on\n$V=[n]$ w.r.t. the usual linear order (called interval system). We present an\nalmost sure representation result for EIPs. Attached to each transient Markov\nchain is the notion of Martin boundary. The points in the boundary attached to\nEIPs can be seen as limits of growing interval systems. We obtain a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between these limits and compact subsets $K$ of the triangle\nwith $(x,x)\\in K$ for all $x\\in[0,1]$. Interval hypergraphs are a\ngeneralizations of hierarchies and as a consequence we obtain a representation\nresult for exchangeable hierarchies, which is close to a result of Forman,\nHaulk and Pitman. Several ordered discrete structures can be seen as interval\nsystems with additional properties, i.e. Schr\\\"oder trees and binary trees. We\ndescribe limits of Schr\\\"oder trees as certain tree-like compact sets.\nConsidering binary trees we thus obtain a homeomorphic description of the\nMartin boundary of R\\'emy's tree growth chain, which has been analyzed by\nEvans, Gr\\\"ubel and Wakolbinger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 14:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Authors conclude that the list of candidate parent bodies for\nsedimentary meteorites includes, but is not limited by the Earth, Mars,\nEnceladus, Ganymede, Europa, and hypothetical planets that could exist between\norbits of Mars and Jupiter in the past. Authors argue that extraterrestrial\norigin and a parent body for meteoritic sedimentary rocks may be identified\nbased on the entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of\noxygen and noble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial\ncontamination and may exhibit significant heterogeneity within the Solar system\nand within the parent cosmic bodies. Observed fall of a cosmic body, evidence\nof hypervelocity fall, signs of impact in target, and the presence of fusion\ncrust, melting, and/or shock deformation features in the fragments should be\nconsidered as priority signs of meteoritic origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 05:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Production in interferon (IFN) SARs is\nachieved through activation of the Jak-Stat pathway, and downstream\nupregulation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IFN transcription, but the\nrole that high and low affinity IFNs play in this process remains unclear. We\npresent a comparative between a minimal spatio-temporal partial differential\nequation (PDE) model and a novel spatio-structural-temporal (SST) model for the\nconsideration of receptor, binding, and metabolic aspects of SAR behaviour.\nUsing the SST framework, we simulate single- and multi-cluster paradigms of IFN\ncommunication. Simulations reveal a cyclic process between the binding of IFN\nto the receptor, and the consequent increase in metabolism, decreasing the\npropensity for binding due to the internal feed-back mechanism. One observes\nthe effect of heterogeneity between cellular clusters, allowing them to\nindividualise and increase local production, and within clusters, where we\nobserve `sub popular quiescence'; a process whereby intra-cluster\nsubpopulations reduce their binding and metabolism such that other such\nsubpopulations may augment their production. Finally, we observe the ability\nfor low affinity IFN to communicate a long range signal, where high affinity\ncannot, and the breakdown of this relationship through the introduction of cell\nmotility. Biological systems may utilise cell motility where environments are\nunrestrictive and may use fixed system, with low affinity communication, where\na localised response is desirable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 11:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

We explore the connections of algorithmic complexity---both\ntheoretical and numerical---with geometric properties mainly symmetry and\ntopology from an (algorithmic) information-theoretic perspective.
