However, actual processes responsible\nfor transferring the energy to the ICM are still being debated. One attractive\npossibility is the excitation of internal waves, which are trapped in the\ncluster's core and eventually dissipate.

These images and videos require a fairly\nlarge amount of bandwidth during transmission. Accordingly, high quality image\nand video postings become a challenge for the network service provider,\nespecially in a crowded environment where bandwidth is in high demand. In this\npaper we present a user satisfaction driven bandwidth allocation scheme for\nimage transmission in such environments. In an image, there are always objects\nthat stand out more than others. The reason behind some set of objects being\nmore important in a scene is based on a number of visual, as well as, cognitive\nfactors. Being motivated by the fact that user satisfaction is more dependent\non the quality of these salient objects in an image than non-salient ones, we\npropose a quantifiable metric for measuring user-satisfiability (based on image\nquality and delay of transmission). The bandwidth allocation technique proposed\nthereafter, ensures that this user-satisfiability is maximized. Unlike the\nexisting approaches that utilize some fixed set of non-linear functions for\nframing the user-satisfiability index, our metric is modelled over customer\nsurvey data, where the unknown parameters are trained with machine learning\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 21:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

In\nreality, the novelty class is often absent during training, poorly sampled or\nnot well defined. Therefore, one-class classifiers can efficiently model such\nproblems. However, due to the unavailability of data from the novelty class,\ntraining an end-to-end deep network is a cumbersome task. In this paper,\ninspired by the success of generative adversarial networks for training deep\nmodels in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, we propose an end-to-end\narchitecture for one-class classification. Our architecture is composed of two\ndeep networks, each of which trained by competing with each other while\ncollaborating to understand the underlying concept in the target class, and\nthen classify the testing samples. One network works as the novelty detector,\nwhile the other supports it by enhancing the inlier samples and distorting the\noutliers. The intuition is that the separability of the enhanced inliers and\ndistorted outliers is much better than deciding on the original samples. The\nproposed framework applies to different related applications of anomaly and\noutlier detection in images and videos.

The electromagnetic\n(EM) emission from a chip leaks information of the underlying logical\noperations and can be collected using low-cost non-invasive measurements. EM\nbased side-channel attacks (EMSCA) have emerged as a major threat to security\nof encryption engines in a SoC. This paper presents the concept of Blindsight\nwhere a high-frequency inductive voltage regulator (IVR) integrated on the same\nchip with an encryption engine is used to increase resistance against EMSCA.\nHigh-frequency (~100MHz) IVRs are present in modern microprocessors to improve\nenergy-efficiency. We show that an IVR with a randomized control loop (R-IVR)\ncan reduce EMSCA as the integrated inductance acts as a strong EM emitter and\nblinds an adversary from EM emission of the encryption engine. The EM\nmeasurements are performed on a test-chip containing two architectures of a\n128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) engine powered by a high-frequency\nR-IVR and under two attack scenarios, one, where an adversary gains complete\nphysical access of the target device and the other, where the adversary is only\nin proximity of the device.

Importantly, $\\alpha_k$\nmust be a function of the past, and cannot depend on $P_k$ or any of the later\nunseen $p$-values, and must be chosen to guarantee that for any time $t$, the\nFDR up to time $t$ is less than some pre-determined quantity $\\alpha \\in\n(0,1)$. In this work, we present a powerful new framework for online FDR\ncontrol that we refer to as SAFFRON. Like older alpha-investing (AI)\nalgorithms, SAFFRON starts off with an error budget, called alpha-wealth, that\nit intelligently allocates to different tests over time, earning back some\nwealth on making a new discovery. However, unlike older methods, SAFFRON's\nthreshold sequence is based on a novel estimate of the alpha fraction that it\nallocates to true null hypotheses. In the offline setting, algorithms that\nemploy an estimate of the proportion of true nulls are called adaptive methods,\nand SAFFRON can be seen as an online analogue of the famous offline Storey-BH\nadaptive procedure. Just as Storey-BH is typically more powerful than the\nBenjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure under independence, we demonstrate that\nSAFFRON is also more powerful than its non-adaptive counterparts, such as LORD\nand other generalized alpha-investing algorithms. Further, a monotone version\nof the original AI algorithm is recovered as a special case of SAFFRON, that is\noften more stable and powerful than the original. Lastly, the derivation of\nSAFFRON provides a novel template for deriving new online FDR rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2018 22:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

Furthermore, they often involve a large\nnumber of hyper-parameters, and are notoriously sensitive to parameters such as\nthe step-size. By incorporating additional information from the Hessian,\nsecond-order methods, have been shown to be resilient to many such adversarial\neffects.

Network\nadministrators must decide how many middleboxes to run, where to place them,\nand how to direct traffic through them, based on the traffic load and the\nserver and network capacity. Rather than placing specific kinds of middleboxes\non each processing node, we argue that server virtualization allows each server\nnode to host all middlebox functions, and simply vary the fraction of resources\ndevoted to each one. This extra flexibility fundamentally changes the\noptimization problem the network administrators must solve to a new kind of\nmulti-commodity flow problem, where the traffic flows consume bandwidth on the\nlinks as well as processing resources on the nodes.

To address this problem, we propose a general,\nrobust method for detecting PHMs in social media, which we call WESPAD, that\ncombines lexical, syntactic, word embedding-based, and context-based features.\nWESPAD is able to generalize from few examples by automatically distorting the\nword embedding space to most effectively detect the true health mentions.\nUnlike previously proposed state-of-the-art supervised and deep-learning\ntechniques, WESPAD requires relatively little training data, which makes it\npossible to adapt, with minimal effort, to each new disease and condition. We\nevaluate WESPAD on both an established publicly available Flu detection\nbenchmark, and on a new dataset that we have constructed with mentions of\nmultiple health conditions. Our experiments show that WESPAD outperforms the\nbaselines and state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases when the number and\nproportion of true health mentions in the training data is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 02:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 03:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

Accurately predicting\nhuman actions is essential for targeted recommendations that could improve our\nhealth and for personalization of these applications. However, making such\npredictions is extremely difficult due to the complexities of human behavior,\nwhich consists of a large number of potential actions that vary over time,\ndepend on each other, and are periodic. Previous work has not jointly modeled\nthese dynamics and has largely focused on item consumption patterns instead of\nbroader types of behaviors such as eating, commuting or exercising. In this\nwork, we develop a novel statistical model for Time-varying, Interdependent,\nand Periodic Action Sequences. Our approach is based on personalized,\nmultivariate temporal point processes that model time-varying action\npropensities through a mixture of Gaussian intensities. Our model captures\nshort-term and long-term periodic interdependencies between actions through\nHawkes process-based self-excitations. We evaluate our approach on two activity\nlogging datasets comprising 12 million actions taken by 20 thousand users over\n17 months. We demonstrate that our approach allows us to make successful\npredictions of future user actions and their timing. Specifically, our model\nimproves predictions of actions, and their timing, over existing methods across\nmultiple datasets by up to 156%, and up to 37%, respectively. Performance\nimprovements are particularly large for relatively rare and periodic actions\nsuch as walking and biking, improving over baselines by up to 256%. This\ndemonstrates that explicit modeling of dependencies and periodicities in\nreal-world behavior enables successful predictions of future actions, with\nimplications for modeling human behavior, app personalization, and targeting of\nhealth interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 03:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Although sufficient\nfor studying the thermodynamic aspects of the system, static approximation\nignores the contributions made by time-dependent, or non-static, fluctuations\nin the paths of the path integral. This non-static component is very small\nrelative to the static part, and its careful treatment is necessary for the\ncalculation of small non-extensive quantities such as the energy gap within the\npath integral framework. We propose a formalism for incorporating non-static\neffects into the path integral calculation of a class of spin models whose\npartition functions are reducible to the trace of a single spin (often known as\nthe effective Hamiltonian). We first show that the time-dependent behavior of\nthe single spin trace is governed by the Pauli equation. Time-dependent\nperturbation theory is used to obtain a perturbative expansion of the solution\nof the Pauli equation, and then for the single spin trace. This gives us a\nperturbative expansion of the path integral which can be integrated\nsystematically using standard techniques.

An\nencoder receives input symbols one per unit time from an i.i.d. source and\nsubmits binary codewords to a FIFO buffer that transmits bits at a fixed rate\nto a receiver/decoder. Each input symbol at the encoder is viewed as a status\nupdate by the source and the system performance is characterized by the status\nupdate age, defined as the number of time units (symbols) the decoder output\nlags behind the encoder input. An upper bound on the average status age is\nderived from the exponential bound on the probability of error in streaming\nsource coding with delay. Apart from the influence of the error exponent that\ndescribes the convergence of the error, this upper bound also scales with the\nconstant multiplier term in the error probability. However, the error exponent\ndoes not lead to an accurate description of the status age for small delay and\nsmall blocklength.

As the linearized system around zero is not null-controllable, the\nusual strategy consists in using the return method, introduced by Jean-Michel\nCoron, or the method of power series expansions.

To model the randomness\nof language spreading, we propose the Batch Markov Monte Carlo Simulation with\nMigration(BMMCSM) algorithm, in which each agent is treated as a language\nstack. The agent learns languages and migrates based on the proposed Batch\nMarkov Property according to the transition matrix T and migration matrix M.\nSince population plays a crucial role in language spreading, we also introduce\nthe Mortality and Fertility Mechanism, which controls the birth and death of\nthe simulated agents, into the BMMCSM algorithm. The simulation results of\nBMMCSM show that the numerical and geographic distribution of languages varies\nacross the time. The change of distribution fits the world cultural and\neconomic development trend. Next, when we construct Matrix T, there are some\nentries of T can be directly calculated from historical statistics while some\nentries of T is unknown. Thus, the key to the success of the BMMCSM lies in the\naccurate estimation of transition matrix T by estimating the unknown entries of\nT under the supervision of the known entries. To achieve this, we first\nconstruct a 20 by 20 by 5 factor tensor X to characterize each entry of T. Then\nwe train a Random Forest Regressor on the known entries of T and use the\ntrained regressor to predict the unknown entries. The reason why we choose\nRandom Forest(RF) is that, compared to Single Decision Tree, it conquers the\nproblem of over fitting and the Shapiro test also suggests that the residual of\nRF subjects to the Normal distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 07:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Using Monte Carlo\n(MC) based GEANT4 simulation, numerous parameters influencing the light\ncollection and thereby the energy resolution of the antineutrino detector\nmodule are studied: e.g., degrees of scintillator surface roughness, reflector\ntype, and its ap- plying method onto scintillator and light guide surface, the\nreflectivity of the reflector, light guide geometries and diameter of the\nphotocathode. The impact of each parameter is inves- tigated by looking at the\ndetected spectrum, i.e. the number photoelectrons per depositing energy.

The\ndust temperature calculated by the radiative transfer simulation based on the\navailable luminosity reaches values up to 900 K.

Given a Hamiltonian action of K on a compact symplectic manifold X,\nthe normsquare of the moment map defines a Morse stratification of X by locally\nclosed symplectic submanifolds such that the stratum to which any x in X\nbelongs is determined by the limiting behaviour of its downwards trajectory\nunder the gradient flow with respect to a suitably compatible Riemannian metric\non X. The open stratum indexed by 0 retracts K-equivariantly via this gradient\nflow to the minimum which is the zero-locus of the moment map (if this is not\nempty). The usual 'symplectic quotient' for the action of K on any other\nstratum is empty.

Conventional\napproaches require at least some manual inputs from the user, such as loop\nbounds and infeasible path information, which are hard to obtain and can lead\nto unsafe results if they are incorrect. This is aggravated by the lack of a\ncomprehensive explanation of the WCET estimate, i.e., a specific trace showing\nhow WCET was reached. It is therefore hard to spot incorrect inputs and hard to\nimprove the worst-case timing of the application. Meanwhile, modern processors\nhave reached a complexity that refutes analysis and puts more and more burden\non the practitioner. In this article we show how all of these issues can be\nsignificantly mitigated or even solved, if we use processors that are amenable\nto WCET analysis. We define and identify such processors, and then we propose\nan automated tool set which estimates a precise WCET without unsafe manual\ninputs, and also reconstructs a maximum-detail view of the WCET path that can\nbe examined in a debugger environment. Our approach is based on Model Checking,\nwhich however is known to scale badly with growing application size. We address\nthis issue by shifting the analysis to source code level, where source code\ntransformations can be applied that retain the timing behavior, but reduce the\ncomplexity. Our experiments show that fast and precise estimates can be\nachieved with Model Checking, that its scalability can even exceed current\napproaches, and that new opportunities arise in the context of \"timing\ndebugging\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 10:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In this work, we consider a specific task from quantum physics, i.e.\nquantum state transfer in a one-dimensional spin chain. The mission for the\nmachine is to find transfer schemes with fastest speeds while maintaining high\ntransfer fidelities. The first scenario we consider is when the Hamiltonian is\ntime-independent. We update the coupling strength by minimizing a loss function\ndependent on both the fidelity and the speed.

In practice, the responsiveness to such measures depends on the\nwealth of each individual. This leads to a natural, but largely unexplored,\nquestion.

Therefore, understanding the formation and evolution of circumbinary\ndisks is crucial for a complete scenario of planet formation. The aim of this\npaper is to present the detection of a circumbinary disk around Oph-IRS67 and\nanalyse its structure. We present high-angular-resolution (0.4\", 60 AU)\nobservations of C17O, H13CO+ , C34S, SO2, C2H and c-C3H2 molecular transitions\nwith ALMA at 0.8 mm. The spectrally and spatially resolved maps reveal the\nkinematics of the circumbinary disk as well as its chemistry. Molecular\nabundances are estimated using RADEX. The continuum emission reveals the\npresence of a circumbinary disk around the two sources. This disk has a\ndiameter of ~620 AU and is well traced by C17O and H13CO+ emission. C2H and\nc-C3H2 trace a higher-density region which is spatially offset from the sources\n(~430 AU). Finally, SO2 shows compact emission around one of the sources,\nOph-IRS67 B. The molecular transitions which trace the circumbinary disk are\nconsistent with a Keplerian profile on disk scales (< 200 AU) and an infalling\nprofile for envelope scales (> 200 AU). The Keplerian fit leads to a mass of\n2.2 Msun. Inferred CO abundances w.r.t. H2 are comparable to the canonical ISM\nvalue of 2.7e-4. This study proves the first detection of the circumbinary disk\nassociated with Oph-IRS67. The disk is chemically differentiated from the\nnearby high-density region. The lack of methanol emission suggests the extended\ndisk dominates the mass budget in the inner- most regions of the protostellar\nenvelope, generating a flat density profile where less material is exposed to\nhigh temperatures. Thus, complex organic molecules would be associated with\nlower column densities. Finally, Oph-IRS67 is a promising candidate for the\ndetection of both circumstellar disks with higher-angular-resolution\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 13:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Specifically, we define a Max-Mahalanobis distribution\n(MMD) and theoretically show that if the input distributes as a MMD, the linear\ndiscriminant analysis (LDA) classifier will have the best robustness to\nadversarial examples. We further propose a novel Max-Mahalanobis linear\ndiscriminant analysis (MM-LDA) network, which explicitly maps a complicated\ndata distribution in the input space to a MMD in the latent feature space and\nthen applies LDA to make predictions. Our results demonstrate that the MM-LDA\nnetworks are significantly more robust to adversarial attacks, and have better\nperformance in class-biased classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

During the past decades, several techniques have been suggested\nto estimate the tissue elasticity by measuring the displacement of the Carotid\nvessel wall. Cross correlation-based methods are the most prevalent approaches\nto measure the strain exerted in the wall vessel by the blood pressure. In the\ncase of a low pressure, the displacement is too small to be apparent in\nultrasound imaging, especially in the regions far from the center of the\nvessel, causing a high error of displacement measurement. On the other hand,\nincreasing the compression leads to a relatively large displacement in the\nregions near the center, which reduces the performance of the cross\ncorrelation-based methods. In this study, a non-rigid image registration-based\ntechnique is proposed to measure the tissue displacement for a relatively large\ncompression. The results show that the error of the displacement measurement\nobtained by the proposed method is reduced by increasing the amount of\ncompression while the error of the cross correlationbased method rises for a\nrelatively large compression.

As a byproduct, we provide a new proof\nof the fact that noncocompact triangle groups of quadratic invariant trace\nfield have the projective line over that field as the set of cross-ratios of\ncusps.\n  Our proof is based on an analysis of the action of nonnegative matrices with\nquadratic integer entries on the Weil height of points. As a consequence of the\nanalysis, we show that long symbolic sequences in the alphabet of our maps can\nbe effectively split into blocks of predetermined shape having the property\nthat the height of points which obey the sequence and belong to the base field\ndecreases strictly at each block end. Since the height cannot decrease\ninfinitely, the termination property follows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:07:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

As a\nresult the DM is required to worry about the robustness of their model to tail\nmisspecifications if they want to conduct principled inference. In this paper\nwe alleviate these concerns for the DM. We advance recent methodological\ndevelopments in general Bayesian updating (Bissiri, Holmes and Walker, 2016) to\npropose a statistically well principled Bayesian updating of beliefs targeting\nthe minimisation of more general divergence criteria.

Threats arise from interactions among\npedestrians, bicycles and vehicles, more complicated vehicle trajectories in\nthe absence of lane markings, phases that prevent determining who has the right\nof way, invisible vehicle approaches, vehicle obstructions, and illegal\nmovements. These challenges are not fully addressed by the \"road diet\" and road\nredesign prescribed in Vision Zero plans, nor will they be completely overcome\nby autonomous vehicles with their many sensors and tireless attention to\nsurroundings. Accidents can also occur because drivers, cyclists and\npedestrians do not have the information they need to avoid wrong decisions. In\nthese cases, the missing information can be computed and broadcast by an\nintelligent intersection. The information gives the current full signal phase,\nan estimate of the time when the phase will change, and the occupancy of the\nblind spots of the driver or autonomous vehicle. The paper develops a design of\nthe intelligent intersection, motivated by the analysis of an accident at an\nintersection in Tempe, AZ, between an automated Uber Volvo and a manual Honda\nCRV and culminates in a proposal for an intelligent intersection\ninfrastructure.
