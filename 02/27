The non-baryonic dynamics is\ndescribed by quark and diquark terms that couple to the gauge field. When\nevaluating the quark and diquark contributions in the strong coupling limit the\npartition function completely factorizes into baryon bags and a complementary\ndomain. Baryon bags are regions in space-time where the dynamics is described\nby a single free fermion made out of three quarks propagating coherently as a\nbaryon.

Conflict-free\nreplicated data types (CRDTs) are widely used in eventually consistent systems\nto reduce concurrency control. However, due to the lack of consistent\nnon-monotonic operations, the usage of CRDTs can be difficult. In this paper,\nwe propose a new consistency protocol, the observable atomic consistency\nprotocol (OACP). OACP enables a principled relax- ation of strong consistency\nto improve performance in specific scenarios. OACP combines the advantages of\nmergeable data types, specifically, convergent replicated data types, and\nreliable total order broadcast to provide on-demand strong consistency. By\nproviding observable atomic consistency, OACP avoids the anomalies of related\nprotocols. We provide a distributed, cluster-enabled implementation of OACP\nbased on Akka, a widely-used actor-based middleware.

In the case of electrons and\nphonons, an electron-phonon fluid is expected to exhibit strong phonon-drag\ntransport signatures and an anomalously low thermal conductivity. The Dirac\nsemi-metal PtSn4 has a very low resistivity at low temperatures and shows a\npronounced phonon drag peak in the low temperature thermopower; it is therefore\nan excellent candidate for hosting a hydrodynamic electron-phonon fluid. Here\nwe report measurements of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the\nlongitudinal and Hall electrical resistivities, the thermopower and the thermal\nconductivity of PtSn4.

To enable this, Tornado employs a sophisticated runtime system\nthat can dynamically configure all aspects of the application - from selecting\nwhich parallelization scheme to apply to specifying which accelerators to use.\nBy using this ability, the end-user, and not the developer, can transparently\nmake use of any available multi-/many-core processor or hardware accelerator.\n  To showcase the impact of Tornado, we implement a real-world computer vision\napplication and deploy it across nine accelerators without having to modify the\nsource code or even explicitly re-compile the application.

The ongoing star formation in the\ntidal tails of post-merger galaxies can be directly studied from ultraviolet\n(UV) imaging observations. The post merger galaxy NGC7252 (\"Atoms-for-Peace\"\ngalaxy) is observed with the Astrosat UV imaging telescope (UVIT) in broadband\nNUV and FUV filters to isolate the star forming regions in the tidal tails and\nstudy the spatial variation in star formation rates.

The integrated star formation rate of NGC7252 (i.e.,\nthat in the galaxy and tidal tails combined) without correcting for extinction\nis found to be 0.81 $\\pm$ 0.01 M$_{\\odot}$/yr.

Specifically, for a\ndynamic graph on $n$-vertices, with arboricity bounded by $\\alpha$ at all\ntimes, the BF algorithm supports edge updates in $O(\\log n)$ amortized update\ntime, while keeping the maximum outdegree in the graph bounded by $O(\\alpha)$.\nSuch an orientation provides a basic data structure for uniformly sparse\ngraphs, which found applications to a plethora of dynamic graph algorithms.\n  A significant weakness of the BF algorithm is the possible \\emph{temporary}\nblowup of the maximum outdegree, following edge insertions. Although BF\neventually reduces all outdegrees to $O(\\alpha)$, local memory usage at the\nvertices, which is an important quality measure in distributed systems, cannot\nbe bounded. We show how to modify the BF algorithm to guarantee that the\noutdegrees of all vertices are bounded by $O(\\alpha)$ at all times, without\nhurting any of its other properties, and present an efficient distributed\nimplementation of the modified algorithm. This provides the \\emph{first}\nrepresentation of distributed networks in which the local memory usage at all\nvertices is bounded by the arboricity (which is essentially the average degree\nof the densest subgraph) rather than the maximum degree.\n  For settings where there are no local memory constraints, we take the\ntemporary outdegree blowup to the extreme and allow a permanent outdegree\nblowup. This allows us to address the second significant weakness of the BF\nalgorithm -- its inherently \\emph{global} nature: An insertion of an edge\n$(u,v)$ may trigger changes in the orientations of edges that are far away from\n$u$ and $v$. We suggest an alternative \\emph{local} scheme, which does not\nguarantee any outdegree bound on the vertices, yet is just as efficient as the\nBF scheme for various applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

In a\nrecent work [J. Tura et al.

Here, we address the question of assessing the number of particles\nsharing genuinely nonlocal correlations in a multipartite system. This\nendeavour is a priori challenging, as known Bell inequalities for genuine\nnonlocality suffer from the above shortcomings, plus a number of measurement\nsettings scaling exponentially with the system size. We first show that most of\nthese constraints drop once the witnesses corresponding to these inequalities\nare expressed: in systems where multipartite expectation values can be\nevaluated, these witnesses can reveal genuine nonlocality for an arbitrary\nnumber of particles with just two collective measurements. We then introduce a\ngeneral framework focused on two-body Bell-like inequalities. We show that they\nalso provide information about the number of particles that are genuinely\nnonlocal. Then, we characterize all such inequalities for a finite system size.\nWe provide witnesses of Bell correlation depth $k\\leq6$ for any number of\nparties, within experimental reach.

This approach\nallows to compensate losses and refill selectively the photonic population so\nto sustain a desired steady-state. It relies in particular on the use of a\nfrequency-dependent incoherent pump which can be implemented, e.g., via\nembedded two-level systems maintained at a strong inversion of population. As\nspecific applications of these methods, we discuss the generation of Mott\nInsulator (MI) and Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states of light. As a first\nstep, we present the case of a narrowband emission spectrum and show how this\nallows for the stabilization of MI and FQH states under the condition that the\nphotonic states are relatively flat in energy. As soon as the photonic\nbandbwidth becomes comparable to the emission linewidth, important\nnon-equilibrium signatures and entropy generation appear. As a second step, we\nreview a more advanced configuration based on reservoirs with a broadband\nfrequency distribution, and we highlight the potential of this configuration\nfor the quantum simulation of equilibrium quantum phases at zero temperature\nwith tunable chemical potential. As a proof of principle we establish the\napplicability of our scheme to the Bose-Hubbard model by confirming the\npresence of a perfect agreement with the ground-state predictions both in the\nMott Insulating and superfluid regions, and more generally in all parts of the\nparameter space. Future prospects towards the quantum simulation of more\ncomplex configurations are finally outlined, along with a discussion of our\nscheme as a concrete realization of quantum annealing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Using analytic arguments supported by controlled numerical\nsimulations of tidally-stripped flattened two-component dwarf galaxies, we\ninvestigate interpretations of Crater II within standard galaxy formation\ntheory. Heavy tidal disruption is necessary to explain the velocity-dispersion\nsuppression which is plausible if the proper motion of Crater II is\n$(\\mu_{\\alpha*},\\mu_\\delta)=(-0.21\\pm0.09,-0.24\\pm0.09)\\mathrm{mas\\,yr}^{-1}$.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the velocity dispersion of tidally-disrupted\nsystems is solely a function of the total mass loss even for weakly-embedded\nand flattened systems. The half-light radius evolution depends more sensitively\non orbital phase and the properties of the dark matter profile. The half-light\nradius of weakly-embedded cusped systems rapidly decreases producing some\ntension with the Crater II observations. This tension is alleviated by cored\ndark matter profiles, in which the half-light radius can grow after tidal\ndisruption. The evolution of flattened galaxies is characterised by two\ncompeting effects: tidal shocking makes the central regions rounder whilst\ntidal distortion produces a prolate tidally-locked outer envelope.

We study PT due to quantum\nevolution under a transverse field $B_\\perp$ of an n-qubit system that encodes\n${\\cal E}(z)$. We focus on a simple yet nontrivial model: $M$ randomly chosen\n\"marked\" bit-strings ($2^n \\gg M$) are assigned energies in the interval ${\\cal\nE}(z)\\in[-n -W/2, n + W/2]$ with $W << B_\\perp$, while the rest of the states\nare assigned energy $0$.

Unlike the Hamiltonians\nused in analog quantum search algorithms, the model we consider is\nnon-integrable, and the transverse field delocalizes the marked states.

GJ 9827 (K2-135) has recently been found to host a tightly packed\nsystem consisting of three transiting small planets whose orbital periods of\n1.2, 3.6, and 6.2 days are near the 1:3:5 ratio. GJ 9827 hosts the nearest\nplanetary system (d = $30.32\\pm1.62$ pc) detected by Kepler and K2 . Its\nbrightness (V = 10.35 mag) makes the star an ideal target for detailed studies\nof the properties of its planets.\n  Results. We find that GJ 9827 b has a mass of\n$M_\\mathrm{b}=3.74^{+0.50}_{-0.48}$ $M_\\oplus$ and a radius of\n$R_\\mathrm{b}=1.62^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$ $R_\\oplus$, yielding a mean density of\n$\\rho_\\mathrm{b} = 4.81^{+1.97}_{-1.33}$ g cm$^{-3}$. GJ 9827 c has a mass of\n$M_\\mathrm{c}=1.47^{+0.59}_{-0.58}$ $M_\\oplus$, radius of\n$R_\\mathrm{c}=1.27^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$ $R_\\oplus$, and a mean density of\n$\\rho_\\mathrm{c}= 3.87^{+2.38}_{-1.71}$ g cm$^{-3}$. For GJ 9827 d we derive\n$M_\\mathrm{d}=2.38^{+0.71}_{-0.69}$ $M_\\oplus$,\n$R_\\mathrm{d}=2.09^{+0.22}_{-0.21}$ $R_\\oplus$, and $\\rho_\\mathrm{d}=\n1.42^{+0.75}_{-0.52}$ g cm$^{-3}$.\n  Conclusions. GJ 9827 is one of the few known transiting planetary systems for\nwhich the masses of all planets have been determined with a precision better\nthan 30%. This system is particularly interesting because all three planets are\nclose to the limit between super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. We also find that\nthe planetary bulk compositions are compatible with a scenario where all three\nplanets formed with similar core/atmosphere compositions, and we speculate that\nwhile GJ 9827 b and GJ 9827 c lost their atmospheric envelopes, GJ 9827 d\nmaintained its atmosphere, owing to the much lower stellar irradiation. This\nmakes GJ 9827 one of the very few systems where the dynamical evolution and the\natmospheric escape can be studied in detail for all planets, helping us to\nunderstand how compact systems form and evolve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

A less well understood fact is that away from the\nRK point the quantum-classical connection persists: in this case the\nHamiltonian corresponds to a non-stochastic \"tilted\" operator that encodes the\nstatistics of time-integrated observables of the classical stochastic problem.\nThis implies a direct relation between the phase behaviour of quantum dimers\nand properties of ensembles of stochastic trajectories of classical dimers.

Few, if any, can scale to a large-sized graph with millions of nodes\ndue to both computational complexity and memory requirements. In this paper, we\nrelax this limitation by introducing the MultI-Level Embedding (MILE) framework\n-- a generic methodology allowing contemporary graph embedding methods to scale\nto large graphs. MILE repeatedly coarsens the graph into smaller ones using a\nhybrid matching technique to maintain the backbone structure of the graph.

The proposed MILE framework is agnostic to the underlying graph\nembedding techniques and can be applied to many existing graph embedding\nmethods without modifying them.

In this work, the energetics of octahedral tilting in the\ninorganic metal halide perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsSnI$_3$ are investigated\nusing first-principles density functional theory calculations. Several low\nenergy paths between symmetry equivalent variants of the stable orthorhombic\n(\\textit{Pnma}) perovskite variant are identified and investigated. The results\nare in favor of the presence of dynamic disorder in the octahedral tilting\nphase transitions of inorganic halide perovskites. In particular, one specific\ntype of path, corresponding to an out-of-phase \"tilt switch\", is found to have\nsignificantly lower energy barrier than the others, which indicates the\nexistence of a temperature range where the dynamic fluctuations of the\noctahedra follow only this type of path. This could produce a time averaged\nstructure corresponding to the intermediate tetragonal (\\textit{P4/mbm})\nstructure observed in experiments.

This\nprocess often involves solving similar optimization problems over and over\nagain with slightly modified input parameters, often under tight latency\nrequirements. We consider the problem of using the information available\nthrough this repeated solution process to directly learn a model of the optimal\nsolution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need to solve\ncomputationally expensive large-scale parametric programs in real time. Our\nproposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active constraints, from\nwhich the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as\nfeatures preserves information about the physics of the system, enables\ninterpretable models, accounts for relevant safety constraints, and is easy to\nrepresent and encode. However, the total number of active sets is also very\nlarge, as it grows exponentially with system size. The key contribution of this\npaper is a streaming algorithm that learns the relevant active sets from\ntraining samples consisting of the input parameters and the corresponding\noptimal solution, without any assumptions on the problem structure. The\nalgorithm comes with theoretical performance guarantees, and is known to\nconverge fast for problem instances with a small number of relevant active\nsets. It can thus be used to establish the practicability of the learning\nmethod. Through extensive experiments on the Optimal Power Flow problem, we\nobserve that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting\nthat the active sets is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning\nalgorithm to target.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 23:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:54:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 23:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 20:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

Link prediction\nheuristics use some score functions, such as common neighbors and Katz index,\nto measure the likelihood of links. They have obtained wide practical uses due\nto their simplicity, interpretability, and for some of them, scalability.\nHowever, every heuristic has a strong assumption on when two nodes are likely\nto link, which limits their effectiveness on networks where these assumptions\nfail. In this regard, a more reasonable way should be learning a suitable\nheuristic from a given network instead of using predefined ones. By extracting\na local subgraph around each target link, we aim to learn a function mapping\nthe subgraph patterns to link existence, thus automatically learning a\n`heuristic' that suits the current network. In this paper, we study this\nheuristic learning paradigm for link prediction. First, we develop a novel\n$\\gamma$-decaying heuristic theory. The theory unifies a wide range of\nheuristics in a single framework, and proves that all these heuristics can be\nwell approximated from local subgraphs.

Disregarding these temporal drifts in modelling user\npreferences can result in unhelpful recommendations. Moreover, different\ntemporal patterns can be associated with various preference domains, and\npreference components and their combinations. These components comprise\npreferences over features, preferences over feature values, conditional\ndependencies between features, socially-influenced preferences, and bias. For\nexample, in the movies domain, the user can change his rating behaviour (bias\nshift), her preference for genre over language (feature preference shift), or\nstart favouring drama over comedy (feature value preference shift). In this\npaper, we first propose a novel latent factor model to capture the\ndomain-dependent component-specific temporal patterns in preferences. The\ncomponent-based approach followed in modelling the aspects of preferences and\ntheir temporal effects enables us to arbitrarily switch components on and off.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on three popular recommendation datasets and\nshow that it significantly outperforms the most accurate state-of-the-art\nstatic models. The experiments also demonstrate the greater robustness and\nstability of the proposed dynamic model in comparison with the most successful\nmodels to date. We also analyse the temporal behaviour of different preference\ncomponents and their combinations and show that the dynamic behaviour of\npreference components is highly dependent on the preference dataset and domain.\nTherefore, the results also highlight the importance of modelling temporal\neffects but also underline the advantages of a component-based architecture\nthat is better suited to capture domain-specific balances in the contributions\nof the aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 06:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 02:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

To help\nthe developers debug, numerous information retrieval (IR)-based and\nspectrum-based bug localization techniques have been devised. IR-based\ntechniques process textual information in bug reports, while spectrum-based\ntechniques process program spectra (i.e., a record of which program elements\nare executed for each test case). While both techniques ultimately generate a\nranked list of program elements that likely contain a bug, they only consider\none source of information--either bug reports or program spectra--which is not\noptimal. In light of this deficiency, this paper presents a new approach dubbed\nNetwork-clustered Multi-modal Bug Localization (NetML), which utilizes\nmulti-modal information from both bug reports and program spectra to localize\nbugs. NetML facilitates an effective bug localization by carrying out a joint\noptimization of bug localization error and clustering of both bug reports and\nprogram elements (i.e., methods). The clustering is achieved through the\nincorporation of network Lasso regularization, which incentivizes the model\nparameters of similar bug reports and similar program elements to be close\ntogether. To estimate the model parameters of both bug reports and methods,\nNetML employs an adaptive learning procedure based on Newton method that\nupdates the parameters on a per-feature basis. Extensive experiments on 355\nreal bugs from seven software systems have been conducted to benchmark NetML\nagainst various state-of-the-art localization methods. The results show that\nNetML surpasses the best-performing baseline by 31.82%, 22.35%, 19.72%, and\n19.24%, in terms of the number of bugs successfully localized when a developer\ninspects the top 1, 5, and 10 methods and Mean Average Precision (MAP),\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 06:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

In CGP, the linear equations are solved on a coarsened mesh compared\nto the nonlinear equations, leading to a reduction in central processing unit\n(CPU) time. The accuracy of the CGP scheme has been assessed for the\nadvection-diffusion equation along with the pressure Poisson equation. Here we\nadd another decoupled equation to this set: the energy equation. In this\narticle, we examine the influence of CGP methodology for the first time on\nthermal fields. To this purpose, a semi-implicit-time-integration\nunstructured-triangular-finite-element CGP version is selected. The CGP\nplatform is validated with two different test cases: first, natural convection\ninduced by a hot circular cylinder located in the center of a cold square\ncylinder, and second, the flow over a circular cylinder with the condition of\nconstant cylinder temperature. Regarding the first test case, the CGP and\nnon-CGP simulations are carried out for different Rayleigh numbers. The\nvelocity and temperature fields as well as the local Nusselt number on the\nsurface of the inner hot cylinder calculated by CGP reveal good agreement with\nthe non-CGP data. Concerning the second test case, the temperature variable is\nused as the passive scalar. For different Prandtl numbers, we compare the CGP\nand non-CGP configurations according to the Nusselt number and the spatial\nstructure of the scalar field obtained. The phase lag between the standard and\nCGP approaches is transmitted from the velocity field into the temperature\nfiled, and thus into the local transient Nusselt number. For one and two levels\nof coarsening, the numerical predictions by CGP for the unsteady local heat\ntransfer coefficients agree well with available data in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 06:45:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 23:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

However, its performance is severely restricted by the current\ncontext-vector-based sub-solution evaluation method since this method needs to\naccess the original high dimensional simulation model when evaluating each\nsub-solution and thus requires many computation resources. To alleviate this\nissue, this study proposes a novel surrogate model assisted cooperative\ncoevolution (SACC) framework. SACC constructs a surrogate model for each\nsub-problem obtained via decomposition and employs it to evaluate corresponding\nsub-solutions. The original simulation model is only adopted to reevaluate some\ngood sub-solutions selected by surrogate models, and these real evaluated\nsub-solutions will be in turn employed to update surrogate models. By this\nmeans, the computation cost could be greatly reduced without significantly\nsacrificing evaluation quality. To show the efficiency of SACC, this study uses\nradial basis function (RBF) and success-history based adaptive differential\nevolution (SHADE) as surrogate model and optimizer, respectively. RBF and SHADE\nhave been proved to be effective on small and medium scale problems. This study\nfirst scales them up to LSOPs of 1000 dimensions under the SACC framework,\nwhere they are tailored to a certain extent for adapting to the characteristics\nof LSOP and SACC. Empirical studies on IEEE CEC 2010 benchmark functions\ndemonstrate that SACC significantly enhances the evaluation efficiency on\nsub-solutions, and even with much fewer computation resource, the resultant\nRBF-SHADE-SACC algorithm is able to find much better solutions than traditional\nCC algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 06:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

However, the\naccelerated versions of asynchronous algorithms are rarely studied. In this\npaper, we propose the \"momentum compensation\" technique to accelerate\nasynchronous algorithms for convex problems. Specifically, we first accelerate\nthe plain Asynchronous Gradient Descent, which achieves a faster\n$O(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ (v.s. $O(1/\\epsilon)$) convergence rate for non-strongly\nconvex functions, and $O(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ (v.s. $O(\\kappa\n\\log(1/\\epsilon))$) for strongly convex functions to reach an $\\epsilon$-\napproximate minimizer with the condition number $\\kappa$. We further apply the\ntechnique to accelerate modern stochastic asynchronous algorithms such as\nAsynchronous Stochastic Coordinate Descent and Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient\nDescent. Both of the resultant practical algorithms are faster than existing\nones by order. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider\naccelerated algorithms that allow updating by delayed gradients and are the\nfirst to propose truly accelerated asynchronous algorithms. Finally, the\nexperimental results on a shared memory system show that acceleration can lead\nto significant performance gains on ill-conditioned problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 07:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

It is quite useful to find a universal\nfreezeout condition for each and every nuclear collisions. In this article, we\nhave constructed a hybrid model to calculate the ratio of transverse energy to\ntotal mean multiplicity $E_{T} /N_{ch}$, since this ratio can possibly act as a\nfreezeout condition in heavy-ion collision experiments. Present hybrid model\nblends two approaches : Tsallis statistics and wounded quark approach.\nRecently, Tsallis statistics has been reliably used to obtain the transverse\nmomentum distribution of charged hadrons produced in relativistic ion\ncollisions. On the other side it has been shown that the pseudorapidity\ndistribution of charged hadrons can be calculated satisfactorily using the\nwounded quark model (WQM). We have used this hybrid model to calculate the\ntransverse energy density distributions, $dE_{T}/d\\eta$ at midrapidity using\ncharged particle pseudorapidity distributions, $dN_{ch}/d\\eta$ and mean\ntransverse momentum $\\langle p_{T} \\rangle$ in various type of nuclear\ncollisions. We found that present hybrid model satisfactorily explains the\nexperimental data whether other models fail to reproduce the data at central\nand at peripheral collisions simultaneously. Finally, ratio of transverse\nenergy to total mean multiplicity, $E_{T} /N_{ch}$ has been computed within\nhybrid model and compared with the available experimental data at RHIC and LHC\nenergies. We observed no explicit dependence of $E_{T} /N_{ch}$ on energy as\nwell as centrality and thus it can definitely act as a freezeout criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 08:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Second, the invariance of the IB functional under bijections prevents\nit from capturing properties of the learned representation that are desirable\nfor classification, such as robustness and simplicity. We argue that these\nissues are partly resolved for stochastic DNNs, DNNs that include a (hard or\nsoft) decision rule, or by replacing the IB functional with related, but more\nwell-behaved cost functions. We conclude that recent successes reported about\ntraining DNNs using the IB framework must be attributed to such solutions. As a\nside effect, our results indicate limitations of the IB framework for the\nanalysis of DNNs.

In the\nelement-wise worst-case approach, one constructs a scenario by taking the worst\ncase in each component over all scenarios. Both methods are known to be\n$N$-approximations, where $N$ is the number of scenarios.\n  In this paper, these results are refined by reconsidering their respective\nproofs as optimization problems. We present a linear program to construct a\nrepresentative scenario for the uncertainty set, which guarantees an\napproximation guarantee that is at least as good as for the previous methods.\nIncidentally, we show that the element-wise worst-case approach can have an\nadvantage over the midpoint approach if the number of scenarios is large. In\nnumerical experiments on the selection problem we demonstrate that our approach\ncan improve the approximation guarantee of the midpoint approach by around 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 09:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

A sub-adiabatic temperature gradient\nin the upper overshoot layer of the tachocline causes significant reduction of\nsurface gravity speed, which leads to trapping of the waves near the equator\nand to an increase of the Rossby wave period up to the timescale of solar\ncycles. Dispersion relations of all equatorial magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nshallow water waves are obtained in the upper tachocline conditions and solved\nanalytically and numerically. It is found that the toroidal magnetic field\nsplits equatorial Rossby and Rossby-gravity waves into fast and slow modes. For\na reasonable value of reduced gravity, global equatorial fast magneto-Rossby\nwaves (with the spatial scale of equatorial extent) have a periodicity of 11\nyears, matching the timescale of activity cycles. The solutions are confined\naround the equator between latitudes 20-40, coinciding with sunspot activity\nbelts.

Given that Twitter does not expose the retweet structure - it\nassociates all retweets with the original tweet - we model the latent diffusion\nstructure using only tweet time and user features, and we implement a scalable\nnovel approach to estimate influence over all possible unfoldings. Next, we use\npartisan hashtag analysis to quantify user political polarization and\nengagement. Finally, we use the BotOrNot API to measure user botness (the\nlikelihood of being a bot). We build a two-dimensional \"polarization map\" that\nallows for a nuanced analysis of the interplay between botness, partisanship\nand influence.

The\nr'- and K_s-band light curves show rectangular, flat-bottomed dips, similar to\nthe X-ray mode-switching (active-passive state transitions) behaviour observed\npreviously. The cross-correlation function (CCF) of the optical and near-IR\ndata reveals a strong, broad negative anti-correlation at negative lags, a\nbroad positive correlation at positive lags, with a strong, positive narrow\ncorrelation superimposed. The shape of the CCF resembles the CCF of black hole\nX-ray binaries but the time-scales are different. The features can be explained\nby reprocessing and a hot accretion flow close to the neutron star's\nmagnetospheric radius. The optical emission is dominated by the reprocessed\ncomponent, whereas the near-IR emission contains the emission from plasmoids in\nthe hot accretion flow and a reprocessed component. The rapid active-passive\nstate transition occurs when the hot accretion flow material is channelled onto\nthe neutron star and is expelled from its magnetosphere. During the transition\nthe optical reprocessing component decreases resulting in the removal of a blue\nspectral component. The accretion of clumpy material through the magnetic\nbarrier of the neutron star produces the observed near-IR/optical CCF and\nvariability. The dip at negative lags corresponds to the suppression of the\nnear-IR synchrotron component in the hot flow, whereas the broad positive\ncorrelation at positive lags is driven by the increased synchrotron emission of\nthe outflowing plasmoids. The narrow peak in the CCF is due to the delayed\nreprocessed component, enhanced by the increased X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 11:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

It is shown that the preservation of this metric allows\nfor interpretation of algebraic and spectral properties of the symmetrized\ngraph in the context of the directed graph, due to the relationship between\neffective resistance and the Laplacian spectrum. Additionally, Lyapunov theory\nis used to demonstrate that the Laplacian matrix of a directed graph can be\ndecomposed into the product of a projection matrix, a skew symmetric matrix,\nand the Laplacian matrix of the symmetrized graph.

Recently, deep feed-forward\nneural networks have led to state-of-the-art results in solving various inverse\nimaging problems. However, being task specific, these networks have to be\nlearned for each inverse problem. On the other hand, a more flexible approach\nwould be to learn a deep generative model once and then use it as a signal\nprior for solving various inverse problems. We show that among the various\nstate of the art deep generative models, autoregressive models are especially\nsuitable for our purpose for the following reasons. First, they explicitly\nmodel the pixel level dependencies and hence are capable of reconstructing\nlow-level details such as texture patterns and edges better. Second, they\nprovide an explicit expression for the image prior which can then be used for\nMAP based inference along with the forward model. Third, they can model long\nrange dependencies in images which make them ideal for handling global\nmultiplexing as encountered in various compressive imaging systems. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in solving three\ncomputational imaging problems: Single Pixel Camera (SPC), LiSens and FlatCam.\nFor both real and simulated cases, we obtain better reconstructions than the\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual and quantitative metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 12:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 00:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

The most prominent and slower of the two loss\nfeatures is identified as a configurational leap of the molecules which\ninvolves a simultaneous change in spatial orientation and structural\nconformation, namely between two isomeric forms (gauche$^+$ and gauche$^-$) of\nopposite chirality. In this peculiar dynamic process, the positions of the\nthree chlorine atoms in the crystal lattice remain unchanged, while those of\nthe carbon and hydrogen atoms are modified. This dynamic process is responsible\nfor the disorder observed in an earlier x-ray diffraction study and confirmed\nby our simulation, which is present only at temperatures relatively close to\nthe melting point, starting 40 K below. The onset of the disorder is visible as\nan anomaly in the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity of the sample\nat exactly the same temperature. While the slower relaxation dynamics (combined\nisomerization/reorientation) becomes increasingly more intense on approaching\nthe melting point, the faster dynamics exhibits significantly lower but\nconstant dielectric strength. Based on our molecular dynamics simulations, we\nassign the faster relaxation to large fluctuations of the molecular dipole\nmoments, partly due to large-angle librations of the chloroethane species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 12:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

To that aim, we first\npropose a numeric data type that can be used as drop-in replacement for other\nnumber formats and is---unlike standard floating-point formats---associative.\nWe use this data type to make state-of-the-art GroupBy operators reproducible,\nbut this approach incurs a slowdown between 4x and 12x compared to the same\noperator using conventional database number formats. We thus explore how to\nmodify existing GroupBy algorithms to make them bit-reproducible and efficient.\nBy using vectorized summation on batches and carefully balancing batch size,\ncache footprint, and preprocessing costs, we are able to reduce the slowdown\ndue to reproducibility to a factor between 1.9x and 2.4x of aggregation in\nisolation and to a mere 2.7% of end-to-end query performance even on\naggregation-intensive queries in MonetDB.

In particular, we find that a\nnew type of dynamical quantum phase transition emerges in a dissipation system.\nThe proposed GLOA provides a powerful tool in the investigation of a dynamical\nquantum phase transition in an arbitrary quantum system, which not only can\ncharacterize the robustness of the dynamical quantum phase transition but also\ncan be used to search for new transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 14:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 10:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 13:23:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 00:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Previously, we trained topic models on the full texts of each\nreading, and applied information-theoretic measures to detect that changes in\nhis reading patterns coincided with the boundaries of his three major\nintellectual projects in the period 1837-1860. In this new work we apply the\nreading model to five additional documents, four of them by Darwin: the first\nedition of $\\textit{The Origin of Species}$, two private essays stating\nintermediate forms of his theory in 1842 and 1844, a third essay of disputed\ndating, and Alfred Russel Wallace's essay, which Darwin received in 1858. We\naddress three historical inquiries, previously treated qualitatively: 1) the\nmythology of \"Darwin's Delay,\" that despite completing an extensive draft in\n1844, Darwin waited until 1859 to publish $\\textit{The Origin of Species}$ due\nto external pressures; 2) the relationship between Darwin and Wallace's\ncontemporaneous theories, especially in light of their joint presentation; and\n3) dating of the \"Outline and Draft\" which was rediscovered in 1975 and\npostulated first as an 1839 draft preceding the Sketch of 1842, then as an\ninterstitial draft between the 1842 and 1844 essays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 16:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

One major drawback using a monocular camera\nis that it only makes observations in the two dimensional image plane and can\nnot directly measure the distance to objects. In this paper, we aim at filling\nthis gap by developing a multi-object tracking algorithm that takes an image as\ninput and produces trajectories of detected objects in a world coordinate\nsystem. We solve this by using a deep neural network trained to detect and\nestimate the distance to objects from a single input image. The detections from\na sequence of images are fed in to a state-of-the art Poisson multi-Bernoulli\nmixture tracking filter. The combination of the learned detector and the PMBM\nfilter results in an algorithm that achieves 3D tracking using only mono-camera\nimages as input. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated both in 3D world\ncoordinates, and 2D image coordinates, using the publicly available KITTI\nobject tracking dataset. The algorithm shows the ability to accurately track\nobjects, correctly handle data associations, even when there is a big overlap\nof the objects in the image, and is one of the top performing algorithms on the\nKITTI object tracking benchmark. Furthermore, the algorithm is efficient,\nrunning on average close to 20 frames per second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Although many mechanisms such as the Laplace and\nGaussian mechanisms can be extended to a matrix-valued query function by adding\ni.i.d. noise to each element of the matrix, this method is often sub-optimal as\nit forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typically\nassociated with matrix analysis. In this work, we consider the design of\ndifferential privacy mechanism specifically for a matrix-valued query function.\nThe proposed solution is to utilize a matrix-variate noise, as opposed to the\ntraditional scalar-valued noise. Particularly, we propose a novel differential\nprivacy mechanism called the Matrix-Variate Gaussian (MVG) mechanism, which\nadds a matrix-valued noise drawn from a matrix-variate Gaussian distribution.\nWe prove that the MVG mechanism preserves $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential\nprivacy, and show that it allows the structural characteristics of the\nmatrix-valued query function to naturally be exploited. Furthermore, due to the\nmulti-dimensional nature of the MVG mechanism and the matrix-valued query, we\nintroduce the concept of directional noise, which can be utilized to mitigate\nthe impact the noise has on the utility of the query. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe performance of the MVG mechanism and the advantages of directional noise\nusing three matrix-valued queries on three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find\nthat the MVG mechanism notably outperforms four previous state-of-the-art\napproaches, and provides comparable utility to the non-private baseline. Our\nwork thus presents a promising prospect for both future research and\nimplementation of differential privacy for matrix-valued query functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 19:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

Such techniques can reduce the signal swing in the interconnect\nby using a capacitive divider network and does not require an additional\nvoltage supply. However, the large reduction in signal swing makes it necessary\nto use differential signaling and amplification for successful regeneration at\nthe receiver, which add area and static power. ME effect induced magnetization\nreversal has recently been proposed which shows the possibility of using a low\nvoltage to switch a nanomagnet adjacent to a multi-ferroic oxide.

Aeroplanes and gas\nballoons have been used for the purpose. Here we present a concept where a\nballoon is filled with pure water vapour on ground so that it rises to the\nlaunch altitude. The system resembles a gas balloon because no onboard energy\nsource is carried and no hard objects fall down. We simulate the ascent\nbehaviour of the balloon. In the baseline simulation, we consider a 10 tonne\nrocket lifted to an altitude of 18 km. We model the trajectory of the balloon\nby taking into account steam adiabatic cooling, surface cooling, water\ncondensation and balloon aerodynamic drag. The required steam mass proves to be\nonly 1.4 times the mass of the rocket stage and the ascent time is around 10\nminutes. For small payloads, surface cooling increases the relative amount of\nsteam needed, unless insulation is applied to the balloon skin. The\nground-filled steam balloon seems to be an attractive and sustainable method of\nlifting payloads such as rockets into high altitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 10:48:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 11:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

The photogeneration of ROS is considered as a\ndetrimental side effect in cellular imaging or is proactively utilized for\nablating cancerous tissue. As ancient textiles or biomaterials, silk produced\nby silkworms can directly be used as fabrics or be processed into materials and\nstructures to host other functional nanomaterials. We report that transgenic\nfusion of far-red fluorescent protein (mKate2) with silk provides a\nphotosensitizer hybridization platform for photoinducible control of ROS.\nTaking advantage of green (visible) light activation, native and regenerated\nmKate2 silk can produce and release superoxide and singlet oxygen, in a\ncomparable manner of visible light-driven plasmonic photocatalysis. Thus, the\ngenetic expression of mKate2 in silk offers immediately exploitable and\nscalable photocatalyst-like biomaterials. We further envision that mKate2 silk\ncould potentially rule out hazardous concerns associated with foreign\nsemiconductor photocatalytic nanomaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

The highest-resolution direct laser writing systems use a femtosecond\nlaser to effect two-photon polymerisation. The focal (polymerisation) point is\nsteered over the shape of the desired object with mechanised stages or\ngalvanometer-controlled mirrors. Here we report a new high-resolution direct\nlaser writing system that employs a resonant mirror scanner to achieve a\nsignificant increase in printing speed over galvanometer- or piezo-based\nmethods while maintaining resolution on the order of a micron. This printer is\nbased on a software modification to a commerically available resonant-scanning\ntwo-photon microscope.
