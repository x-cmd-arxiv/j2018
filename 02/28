Neutrinos are always produced\ntogether with gamma-rays, but the gamma-ray flux from extragalactic sources is\nsuppressed due to attenuation in the intergalactic medium. We report the\ndiscovery of a gamma-ray excess at high Galactic latitudes starting at energies\n300 GeV in the data of the Fermi telescope. We show that the multi-TeV\ngamma-ray diffuse emission has spectral characteristics at both low and high\nGalactic latitudes compatible with those of the IceCube high neutrino signal in\nthe same sky regions. This suggests that these gamma-rays are the counterpart\nof the IceCube neutrino signal, implying that a sizable part of the IceCube\nneutrino flux originates from the Milky Way. We argue that the diffuse neutrino\nand gamma-ray signal at high Galactic latitudes originates either from\npreviously unknown nearby cosmic ray \"PeVatron\" source(s), an extended Galactic\nCR halo or from decays of heavy dark matter particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 16:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 12:49:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 13:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

The effect of core excitations must be included in order to gain a\ndetailed understanding of both the ground state and spin-isospin properties of\nthese systems. To this end, we include the vibrational excitation of the core\nnucleus in our model. We solve the three-body core-nucleon-nucleon problem\nincluding core vibrational states to obtain the nuclear ground state as well as\nspin-isospin excitations. The spin-isospin excitations are examined from the\npoint of view of SU(4) multiplets.

These resources can be scavenged by\noffloading heavy computation tasks from small IoT devices in proximity, thereby\novercoming their limitations and lengthening their battery lives. However,\nunlike dedicated servers, the spare resources offered by edge helpers are\nrandom and intermittent. Thus, it is essential for a user to intelligently\ncontrol the amounts of data for offloading and local computing so as to ensure\na computation task can be finished in time consuming minimum energy. In this\npaper, we design energy-efficient control policies in a computation offloading\nsystem with a random channel and a helper with a dynamically loaded CPU.\nSpecifically, the policy adopted by the helper aims at determining the sizes of\noffloaded and locally-computed data for a given task in different slots such\nthat the total energy consumption for transmission and local CPU is minimized\nunder a task-deadline constraint. As the result, the polices endow an\noffloading user robustness against channel-and-helper randomness besides\nbalancing offloading and local computing. By modeling the channel and\nhelper-CPU as Markov chains, the problem of offloading control is converted\ninto a Markov-decision process. Though dynamic programming (DP) for numerically\nsolving the problem does not yield the optimal policies in closed form, we\nleverage the procedure to quantify the optimal policy structure and apply the\nresult to design optimal or sub-optimal policies. For different cases ranging\nfrom zero to large buffers, the low-complexity of the policies overcomes the\n\"curse-of-dimensionality\" in DP arising from joint consideration of channel,\nhelper CPU and buffer states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 16:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

Although they play a key role in modelling random processes with\njumps and discontinuities, the use of $\\alpha$-stable distributions in\ninference often leads to analytically intractable problems. The LePage series,\nwhich is a probabilistic representation employed in this work, is used to\ntransform an intractable, infinite-dimensional inference problem into a\nconditionally Gaussian parametric problem.

In addition to the\nasymptotic normality of the tail of this series, we establish explicit,\nnonasymptotic bounds on the approximation error. Their proofs follow classical\nFourier-analytic arguments, using Ess\\'{e}en's smoothing lemma. Specifically,\nwe consider the distance between the distributions of: $(i)$~the tail of the\nseries and an appropriate Gaussian; $(ii)$~the full series and the truncated\nseries; and $(iii)$~the full series and the truncated series with an added\nGaussian term. In all three cases, sharp bounds are established, and the\ntheoretical results are compared with the actual distances (computed\nnumerically) in specific examples of symmetric $\\alpha$-stable distributions.\nThis analysis facilitates the selection of appropriate truncations in practice\nand offers theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of resulting estimates.

Ultra-high vacuum of SRF guns provides for long lifetime of the\nhigh quantum efficiency (QE) photocathodes, while SRF technology provides for\nhigh accelerating gradients exceeding 10 MV/m. It is especially true for low\nfrequency SRF guns where electrons are generated at photocathodes at the crest\nof accelerating voltage. Two main physics challenges of SRF guns are their\ncompatibility with high QE photocathodes and multipacting. The first is related\nto a possibility of deposition of photocathode materials (such as Cs) on the\nwalls of the SRF cavity, which can result in increased dark current via\nreduction of the bulk Nb work function and in enhancing of a secondary electron\nemission yield (SEY). SEY plays critical role in multipacting, which could both\nspoil the gun vacuum and speed up the deposition of the cathode material on the\nwalls of the SRF cavity. In short, the multipactor behavior in superconducting\naccelerating units must be well understood for successful operation of an SRF\nphoto-injector. In this paper we present our studies of 1.2 MV 113 MHz\nquarter-wave SRF photo-injector serving as a source of electron beam for the\nCoherent electron Cooling experiment (CeC) at BNL.

Hence, proper methodologies and techniques to perform this\nassessment are very relevant. Heuristic evaluation is probably the most\ncommonly used method for usability assessment. Developed by Nielsen and Molich\nin the '90s, traditional heuristic evaluations rely on Nielsen's 10 usability\nheuristics. However, recent evidence suggests that such heuristics are not\nsufficiently complete for dealing with new domains such as interactive\ntelevision, virtual worlds, and many others. In addition to the lack of\nsuitability of traditional heuristics, in the past years the lack of a robust\nmethodology or process to effectively develop and validate these new\ndomain-specific heuristics has been documented. In this paper we summarize\ncurrent evidence on the lack of suitability of traditional heuristics, as well\nas the need to develop new domain-specific heuristics. After identifying and\nacknowledging existing gaps in heuristics for state-of-the-art technology, we\npresent PROMETHEUS, a PROcedural METhodology for developing HEuristics of\nUSability.

As an initial validation of PROMETHEUS, we apply\na questionnaire to several researchers that have used the methodology of Rusu\net. al., and we have also performed a small retrospective study, computing the\nquality indicators of several previous studies. Our results suggest that\nPROMETHEUS is a very promising methodology, and that the metrics and indicators\nare indeed pertinent with respect to the conclusions of previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 19:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

However, the molecular density available for\nexperiments in a downstream science chamber is limited by skimmer clogging,\nwhich constrains the separation between a valve and a skimmer to at least\nseveral hundred nozzle diameters. A recent experiment (Science Advances, 2017,\n3, e1602258) has introduced a new strategy to address this challenge: when a\nskimmer is cooled to a temperature below the freezing point of the carrier gas,\nskimmer clogging can be effectively suppressed. We go beyond this\nproof-of-principle work in several key ways. Firstly, we apply the skimmer\ncooling approach to discharge-produced radical and metastable beams entrained\nin a carrier gas. We also identify two different processes for skimmer clogging\nmitigation-shockwave suppression at temperatures around the carrier gas\nfreezing point and diffusive clogging at even lower temperatures. With the\ncarrier clogging removed, we now fully optimize the production of entrained\nspecies such as hydroxyl radicals, resulting in a gain of 30 in density over\nthe best commercial devices. The gain arises from both clogging mitigation and\nfavorable geometry with a much shorter valve-skimmer distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 21:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

While general relativity allows for only\ntwo tensor gravitational-wave polarizations, general metric theories can\nadditionally predict two vector and two scalar polarizations. The polarization\nof gravitational waves is encoded in the spectral shape of the stochastic\ngravitational-wave background, formed by the superposition of cosmological and\nindividually-unresolved astrophysical sources. Using data recorded by Advanced\nLIGO during its first observing run, we search for a stochastic background of\ngenerically-polarized gravitational waves. We find no evidence for a background\nof any polarization, and place the first direct bounds on the contributions of\nvector and scalar polarizations to the stochastic background.

In this work, we present the analysis of the binary-lens\nevent OGLE-2017-BLG-0329, for which $\\pie$ is measured with a dramatically\nimproved precision using additional data from space-based $Spitzer$\nobservations. We find that while the parallax model based on the ground-based\ndata cannot be distinguished from a zero-$\\pie$ model at 2$\\sigma$ level, the\naddition of the $Spitzer$ data enables us to identify 2 classes of solutions,\neach composed of a pair of solutions according to the well-known ecliptic\ndegeneracy. It is found that the space-based data reduce the measurement\nuncertainties of the north and east components of the microlens-parallax vector\n$\\pivec_{\\rm E}$ by factors $\\sim 18$ and $\\sim 4$, respectively.

Part\nI of this paper proposes a new quadratic transform for FP and treats its\napplication for continuous optimization problems. In this Part II of the paper,\nwe study discrete problems, such as those involving user scheduling, which are\nconsiderably more difficult to solve. Unlike the continuous problems, discrete\nor mixed discrete-continuous problems normally cannot be recast as convex\nproblems. In contrast to the common heuristic of relaxing the discrete\nvariables, this work reformulates the original problem in an FP form amenable\nto distributed combinatorial optimization. The paper illustrates this\nmethodology by tackling the important and challenging problem of uplink\ncoordinated multi-cell user scheduling in wireless cellular systems. Uplink\nscheduling is more challenging than downlink scheduling, because uplink user\nscheduling decisions significantly affect the interference pattern in nearby\ncells. Further, the discrete scheduling variable needs to be optimized jointly\nwith continuous variables such as transmit power levels and beamformers. The\nmain idea of the proposed FP approach is to decouple the interaction among the\ninterfering links, thereby permitting a distributed and joint optimization of\nthe discrete and continuous variables with provable convergence. The paper\nshows that the well-known weighted minimum mean-square-error (WMMSE) algorithm\ncan also be derived from a particular use of FP; but our proposed FP-based\nmethod significantly outperforms WMMSE when discrete user scheduling variables\nare involved, both in term of run-time efficiency and optimizing results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 22:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 20:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Throughout the execution of an algorithm we consider\na sliding window over the last $T$, e.g., polylogarithmic, rounds. Then, in\nsome round, the feasibility of an output only depends on the topology of the\ngraphs in the current sliding window and we call a feasible output a\n$T$-dynamic solution. The guarantees of a $T$-dynamic solution become stronger\nthe more stable the graph is during this sliding window and, in particular,\nthey coincide with the definition of the static graph problem if the graph is\nstatic throughout the window. We further present an abstract framework that\nallows to develop algorithms that output $T$-dynamic solutions in all rounds.\nThe resulting algorithms have another desirable property: If a constant\nneighborhood around some part of the graph is stable during an interval\n$[t_1,t_2]$, the algorithms compute a static solution for this part of the\ngraph throughout the interval $[t_1+T',t_2]$ for some (small) $T'>0$.\n  We demonstrate our generic framework with two sample problems that abstract\nbasic operations in dynamic networks, namely $\\textit{(degree+1)-vertex\ncoloring}$ and $\\textit{maximal independent set (MIS)}$.

The discovery have raised questions about routes of\nformation of these anions in space. Some of the proposed mechanisms assumed\nthat anionic excited electronic states, either metastable or weakly bound, play\na key role in the formation process. Verification of this hypothesis requires\ndetailed knowledge of the electronic states of the anions. Here we investigate\nbound and continuum states of four cyanopolyyne anions, CN$^-$, C$_3$N$^-$,\nC$_5$N$^-$, and C$_7$N$^-$, by means of ab initio calculations. We employ the\nequation-of-motion coupled-cluster method augmented with complex absorbing\npotential. We predict that already in CN$^-$, the smallest anion in the family,\nthere are several low-lying metastable states of both singlet and triplet spin\nsymmetry. These states, identified as shape resonances, are located between\n6.3-8.5 eV above the ground state of the anion (or 2.3-4.5 eV above the ground\nstate of the parent radical) and have widths of a few tenths of eV up to 1 eV.\nWe analyze the identified resonances in terms of leading molecular orbital\ncontributions and Dyson orbitals. As the carbon chain length increases in the\nC$_{2n+1}$N$^-$ series, these resonances gradually become stabilized and\neventually turn into stable valence bound states. The trends in energies of the\ntransitions leading to both resonance and bound excited states can be\nrationalized by means of the H\\\"{u}ckel model. Apart from valence excited\nstates, some of the cyanopolyynes can also support dipole bound states and\ndipole stabilized resonances, owing to a large dipole moment of the parent\nradicals in the lowest $^2\\Sigma^+$ state. We discuss the consequences of\nopen-shell character of the neutral radicals on the dipole-stabilized states of\nthe respective anions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 00:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

Here we present a new lunar origin model. High-energy,\nhigh-angular momentum giant impacts can create a post-impact structure that\nexceeds the corotation limit (CoRoL), which defines the hottest thermal state\nand angular momentum possible for a corotating body. In a typical super-CoRoL\nbody, traditional definitions of mantle, atmosphere and disk are not\nappropriate, and the body forms a new type of planetary structure, named a\nsynestia. Using simulations of cooling synestias combined with dynamic,\nthermodynamic and geochemical calculations, we show that satellite formation\nfrom a synestia can produce the main features of our Moon. We find that cooling\ndrives mixing of the structure, and condensation generates moonlets that orbit\nwithin the synestia, surrounded by tens of bars of bulk silicate Earth (BSE)\nvapor. The moonlets and growing moon are heated by the vapor until the first\nmajor element (Si) begins to vaporize and buffer the temperature. Moonlets\nequilibrate with BSE vapor at the temperature of silicate vaporization and the\npressure of the structure, establishing the lunar isotopic composition and\npattern of moderately volatile elements. Eventually, the cooling synestia\nrecedes within the lunar orbit, terminating the main stage of lunar accretion.\nOur model shifts the paradigm for lunar origin from specifying a certain impact\nscenario to achieving a Moon-forming synestia.

The cases with $p>1$ values, i.e. non-sparse coding studied in\nthis paper, remain a difficulty. We propose an interpretable deep structure\nnamely Frank-Wolfe Network (F-W Net), whose architecture is inspired by\nunrolling and truncating the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving an $L_p$-norm\nconstrained problem with $p\\geq 1$. We show that the Frank-Wolfe solver for the\n$L_p$-norm constraint leads to a novel closed-form nonlinear unit, which is\nparameterized by $p$ and termed $pool_p$. The $pool_p$ unit links the\nconventional pooling, activation, and normalization operations, making F-W Net\ndistinct from existing deep networks either heuristically designed or converted\nfrom projected gradient descent algorithms. We further show that the\nhyper-parameter $p$ can be made learnable instead of pre-chosen in F-W Net,\nwhich gracefully solves the non-sparse coding problem even with unknown $p$. We\nevaluate the performance of F-W Net on an extensive range of simulations as\nwell as the task of handwritten digit recognition, where F-W Net exhibits\nstrong learning capability.

By studying the analyticity properties of\nthermal two-point functions, we derive a \"thermal inversion formula\" whose\noutput is the set of thermal one-point functions for all operators appearing in\na given OPE. This involves identifying a kinematic regime which is the analog\nof the Regge regime for four-point functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the inversion formula by recovering the spectrum and thermal one-point\nfunctions in mean field theory, and computing thermal one-point functions for\nall higher-spin currents in the critical $O(N)$ model at leading order in\n$1/N$. Furthermore, we develop a systematic perturbation theory for thermal\ndata in the large spin, low-twist spectrum of any CFT. We explain how the\ninversion formula and KMS condition may be combined to algorithmically\nconstrain CFTs at finite temperature.

In general, semantic 3D mapping is mainly composed of 3D\nreconstruction and semantic segmentation. As these technologies evolve, there\nhas been great progress in semantic 3D mapping in recent years. Furthermore,\nthe number of robotic applications requiring semantic information in 3D mapping\nto perform high-level tasks has increased, and many studies on semantic 3D\nmapping have been published. Existing methods use a camera for both 3D\nreconstruction and semantic segmentation. However, this is not suitable for\nlarge-scale environments and has the disadvantage of high computational\ncomplexity. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal sensor-based\nsemantic 3D mapping system using a 3D Lidar combined with a camera. In this\nstudy, we build a 3D map by estimating odometry based on a global positioning\nsystem (GPS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and use the latest 2D\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation.

Differential equations are usually solved by putting a multilayer\nperceptron in place of unknown function and training its weights, so that\nequation holds within some margin of error. Commonly used cost is the\nequation's residual squared. Added terms are squared derivatives of said\nresidual with respect to the independent variables. To investigate overfitting,\nthe cost is minimized for points of regular grids with various spacing, and its\nroot mean is compared with its value on much denser test set. Fully connected\nperceptrons with six hidden layers and $2\\cdot10^{4}$, $1\\cdot10^{6}$ and\n$5\\cdot10^{6}$ weights in total are trained with Rprop until cost changes by\nless than 10% for last 1000 epochs, or when the $10000^{\\mathrm{th}}$ epoch is\nreached. Training the network with $5\\cdot10^{6}$ weights to represent simple\n2D function using 10 points with 8 extra derivatives in each produces cost test\nto train ratio of $1.5$, whereas for classical backpropagation in comparable\nconditions this ratio is $2\\cdot10^{4}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 08:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Nevertheless, one can remove \"dominated\" items and create a\n\"representative\" subset of the data set, comprising the \"best items\" in it. A\nPareto-optimal representative is guaranteed to contain the best item of each\npossible ranking, but it can be almost as big as the full data. Representative\ncan be found if we relax the requirement to include the best item for every\npossible user, and instead just limit the users' \"regret\". Existing work\ndefines regret as the loss in score by limiting consideration to the\nrepresentative instead of the full data set, for any chosen ranking function.\n  However, the score is often not a meaningful number and users may not\nunderstand its absolute value. Sometimes small ranges in score can include\nlarge fractions of the data set. In contrast, users do understand the notion of\nrank ordering. Therefore, alternatively, we consider the position of the items\nin the ranked list for defining the regret and propose the {\\em rank-regret\nrepresentative} as the minimal subset of the data containing at least one of\nthe top-$k$ of any possible ranking function.

This cost can be from the\nexpensive task of saving the memory's state and loading data into and out of\nmemory. It is desirable to schedule jobs non-preemptively to avoid the costs of\npreemption. There is a need for non-preemptive system schedulers on desktops,\nservers and data centers. Despite this need, there is a gap between theory and\npractice. Indeed, few non-preemptive \\emph{online} schedulers are known to have\nstrong foundational guarantees. This gap is likely due to strong lower bounds\non any online algorithm for popular objectives. Indeed, typical worst case\nanalysis approaches, and even resource augmented approaches such as speed\naugmentation, result in all algorithms having poor performance guarantees. This\npaper considers on-line non-preemptive scheduling problems in the worst-case\nrejection model where the algorithm is allowed to reject a small fraction of\njobs. By rejecting only a few jobs, this paper shows that the strong lower\nbounds can be circumvented. This approach can be used to discover algorithmic\nscheduling policies with desirable worst-case guarantees. Specifically, the\npaper presents algorithms for the following two objectives: minimizing the\ntotal flow-time and minimizing the total weighted flow-time plus energy under\nthe speed-scaling mechanism. The algorithms have a small constant competitive\nratio while rejecting only a constant fraction of jobs. Beyond specific\nresults, the paper asserts that alternative models beyond speed augmentation\nshould be explored to aid in the discovery of good schedulers in the face of\nthe requirement of being online and non-preemptive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 08:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

Practical phase\nshifters are with coarsely quantized phases, and their number should be reduced\nto a minimum due to cost and power consideration. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel hardware-efficient implementation for hybrid precoding, called the fixed\nphase shifter (FPS) implementation. It only requires a small number of phase\nshifters with quantized and fixed phases. To enhance the spectral efficiency, a\nswitch network is put forward to provide dynamic connections from phase\nshifters to antennas, which is adaptive to the channel states. An effective\nalternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm is developed with closed-form\nsolutions in each iteration to determine the hybrid precoder and the states of\nswitches. Moreover, to further reduce the hardware complexity, a\ngroup-connected mapping strategy is proposed to reduce the number of switches.\nSimulation results show that the FPS fully-connected hybrid precoder achieves\nhigher hardware efficiency with much fewer phase shifters than existing\nproposals. Furthermore, the group-connected mapping achieves a good balance\nbetween spectral efficiency and hardware complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 09:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

To\nincrease the numerical aperture of a lens, the working distance should be\ncompensated, and vice versa. Here we propose and demonstrate a new concept in\noptical microscopy that can achieve both high-resolution imaging and\nlong-working-distance conditions by utilising a scattering layer instead of\nrefractive optics. When light passes through a scattering layer, it creates a\nunique interference pattern. To retrieve the complex amplitude image from the\ninterference pattern without introducing a reference beam, we utilised a\nspeckle-correlation scattering matrix method. This property enables holographic\nmicroscopy without any lens or external reference beam. Importantly, the\nproposed method allows high-resolution imaging with a long working distance\nbeyond what a conventional objective lens can achieve. As an experimental\nverification, we imaged various microscopic samples and compared their\nperformance with off-axis digital holographic microscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 09:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

The two conductors of\neach system are electrically isolated and placed in the two circuits (the drive\nand the drag) of a four-electrode setup. The systems are biased, either by a\ntemperature $\\Delta T$ or a voltage $V$ difference, on the drive circuit, while\nno biases are present on the drag circuit. In the case of a pair of metallic\nislands we use a master equation approach to determine the general properties\nof the dragged heat current $I^{\\rm (h)}_{\\rm drag}$, accounting also for\nco-tunneling contributions and the presence of large biases. Analytic results\nare obtained in the sequential tunneling regime for small biases, finding, in\nparticular, that $I^{\\rm (h)}_{\\rm drag}$ is quadratic in $\\Delta T$ or $V$ and\nnon-monotonous as a function of the inter-island coupling. Finally, by\nreplacing one of the electrodes in the drag circuit with a superconductor, we\nfind that heat can be extracted from the other normal electrode. In the case of\nthe two interacting quantum wires, using the Luttinger liquid theory and the\nbosonization technique, we derive an analytic expression for the thermal\ntrans-resistivity $\\rho^{\\rm (h)}_{12}$, in the weak-coupling limit and at low\ntemperatures. $\\rho^{\\rm (h)}_{12}$ turns out to be proportional to the\nelectric trans-resistivity $\\rho^{\\rm (c)}_{12}$, in such a way that their\nratio (a kind of Wiedemann-Franz law) is proportional to $T^3$.

LoRa/LoRaWAN, like other frequency modulation\nbased radio interfaces, exhibits the \\textit{capture effect} in which only the\nstronger signal of colliding signals will be extracted. This leads to\nunfairness, where far nodes or nodes experiencing higher attenuation are less\nlikely to see their packets received correctly. Therefore, we secondly develop\na transmission power control algorithm to balance the received signal powers\nfrom all nodes regardless of their distances from the gateway for a fair data\nextraction. Simulations show that our approach achieves higher fairness in data\nrate than the state-of-art in almost all network configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 10:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

Each resource has a fixed cost that has to be shared by\nthe players, and each agent has a nonshareable player-specific delay for each\nresource. A prominent example is uncapacitated facility location (UFL), where\nfacilities need to be opened (at a shareable cost) and clients want to connect\nto opened facilities. Each client pays a cost share and his non-shareable\nphysical connection cost. Given any profile of subsets allocated by the agents,\na separable cost sharing protocol determines cost shares that satisfy budget\nbalance on every resource and separability over the resources. Moreover, a\nseparable protocol guarantees existence of pure Nash equilibria in the induced\nstrategic game for the agents. In this paper, we study separable cost sharing\nprotocols in several general combinatorial domains. We provide black-box\nreductions to reduce the design of a separable cost-sharing protocol to the\ndesign of an approximation algorithm for the underlying cost minimization\nproblem. In this way, we obtain new separable cost-sharing protocols in games\nbased on arbitrary player-specific matroids, single-source connection games\nwithout delays, and connection games on $n$-series-parallel graphs with delays.\nAll these reductions are efficiently computable - given an initial allocation\nprofile, we obtain a cheaper profile and separable cost shares turning the\nprofile into a pure Nash equilibrium. Hence, in these domains any approximation\nalgorithm can be used to obtain a separable cost sharing protocol with a price\nof stability bounded by the approximation factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 10:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

The ideal fluid\ntheory is derived directly from Hamilton's Principle for a three-dimensional\nfluid after making a specific approximation to the deformation gradient tensor.\nWe express the equations in Eulerian form after projection on to a reference\nplane. The disc is thought of as a set of fluid columns, each of which is\ncapable of a time-dependent affine transformation, consisting of a translation\ntogether with a linear transformation in three dimensions. Therefore, in\naddition to the usual two-dimensional hydrodynamics in the reference plane, the\ntheory allows for a deformation of the midplane (as occurs in warped discs) and\nfor the internal shearing motions that accompany such deformations. It also\nallows for the vertical expansions driven in non-circular discs by a variation\nof the vertical gravitational field around the horizontal streamlines, or by a\ndivergence of the horizontal velocity. The equations of the affine model embody\nconservation laws for energy and potential vorticity, even for non-planar\ndiscs.

Containers are also\nwidely used in production environments, where a different set of challenges\narise such as security, networking, service discovery and load balancing.\nContainer cluster management tools, such as Kubernetes, attempt to solve these\nproblems by introducing a new control layer with the container as the unit of\ndeployment. However, adding a new control layer is an extra configuration step\nand an additional potential source of runtime errors. The virtual machine\ntechnology offered by cloud providers is more mature and proven in terms of\nsecurity, networking, service discovery and load balancing. However, virtual\nmachines are heavier than containers for local development, are less flexible\nfor resource allocation, and suffer longer boot times. This paper presents an\nalternative to containers that enjoy the best features of both approaches: (1)\nthe use of mature, proven cloud vendor technology; (2) no need for a new\ncontrol layer; and (3) as lightweight as containers. Our solution is i2kit, a\ndeployment tool based on the immutable infrastructure pattern, where the\nvirtual machine is the unit of deployment. The i2kit tool accepts a simplified\nformat of Kubernetes Deployment Manifests in order to reuse Kubernetes' most\nsuccessful principles, but it creates a lightweight virtual machine for each\nPod using Linuxkit. Linuxkit alleviates the drawback in size that using virtual\nmachines would otherwise entail, because the footprint of Linuxkit is\napproximately 60MB. Finally, the attack surface of the system is reduced since\nLinuxkit only installs the minimum set of OS dependencies to run containers,\nand different Pods are isolated by hypervisor technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 11:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

This is a generalization of Strong Triadic Closure, whereas\nit is a relaxation of F-free Edge Deletion. In Strong F-closure, we want to\nselect a maximum number of edges of the input graph G, and mark them as strong\nedges, in the following way: whenever a subset of the strong edges forms a\nsubgraph isomorphic to F, then the corresponding induced subgraph of G is not\nisomorphic to F. Hence the subgraph of G defined by the strong edges is not\nnecessarily F-free, but whenever it contains a copy of F, there are additional\nedges in G to destroy that strong copy of F in G.\n  We study Strong F-closure from a parameterized perspective with various\nnatural parameterizations. Our main focus is on the number k of strong edges as\nthe parameter. We show that the problem is FPT with this parameterization for\nevery fixed graph F, whereas it does not admit a polynomial kernel even when F\n=P_3.

By\nanalogy with the Lorentz transformation in Minkowski space-time, CTMPC is a\ncorrect transformation in curved space-times in a sense that it shows the\ncorrect relation between the time measured by the two observers, moreover,\nLorentz transformation is just a special case of CTMPC applied in Minkowski\nspace-time. We demonstrate that the Coordinate Transformation which Maintains\nthe Local Metric (CTMLM) is one CTMPC, while the mathematical forms of physics\nformulas in QFT will be maintained. As applications of CTMLM, the time dilation\nand Doppler effect with an arbitrary time-dependent relative velocity in curved\nspace-time are analysed. For Minkowski space-time, the time dilation and\nDoppler effect agree with the clock hypothesis. For curved space-time, we show\nthat even if the emitted wave has a narrow frequency range, the Doppler effect\nmay, in general, broaden the frequency spectrum and, at the meantime, shift the\nfrequencies values. These new findings will deepen our understanding on the\nnature of space-time and the Doppler effect in curved space-time, they may also\nprovide theoretical guidance in future astronomical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 13:44:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 06:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

As suggested by Boltzmann, this irreversibility amounts to\nimprobability (rather than impossibility) of the second-law-violating events.\nLater studies suggest that this improbability arises from a fractal attractor\nwhich is dynamically generated in phase space in reversible dissipative\nsystems. However, the same mechanism seems inapplicable to reversible\nconservative systems, since a zero-volume fractal attractor is incompatible\nwith the nonzero phase-space volume, which is a constant of motion due to the\nLiouville theorem. Here we demonstrate that in a Hamiltonian system the fractal\nscaling emerges transiently over an intermediate length scale. Notably, this\ntransient fractality is unveiled by invoking the Loschmidt demon with an\nimperfect accuracy. Moreover, we show that irreversibility from the fractality\ncan be evaluated by means of information theory and the fluctuation theorem.\nThe fractality provides a unified understanding of emergent irreversibility\nover an intermediate time scale regardless of whether the underlying reversible\ndynamics is dissipative or conservative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 15:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

When the number of bins is\nsmall, existing methods often yield minimally informative bounds. We propose\nthree innovations that make meaningful inference possible in interval data\ncontexts. First, we prove novel nonparametric bounds for contexts where the\ndistribution of the censored variable is known. Second, we show that a class of\nmeasures that describe the conditional mean across a fixed interval of the\nconditioning space can often be bounded tightly even when the CEF itself\ncannot. Third, we show that a constraint on CEF curvature can either tighten\nbounds or can substitute for the monotonicity assumption often made in interval\ndata applications. We derive analytical bounds that use the first two\ninnovations, and develop a numerical method to calculate bounds under the\nthird.

The superior ability of\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate soft tissue has led to an\nincreasing use of this imaging technique in the intraoperative planning and\nimplementation of brachytherapy. A technical challenge associated with the use\nof MRI imaging for brachytherapy - in contrast to computed tomography (CT)\nimaging - is the dark-diffuse appearance and thus difficult identification of\nthe catheter paths in the resulting images. This problem is addressed by the\nprecise method described herein of tracing the catheters from the catheter tip.\nThe average identification time for a single catheter path was three seconds on\na standard PC.

This\naims to classify textual content into non-hate or hate speech, in which case\nthe method may also identify the targeting characteristics (i.e., types of\nhate, such as race, and religion) in the hate speech. However, we notice\nsignificant difference between the performance of the two (i.e., non-hate v.s.\nhate). In this work, we argue for a focus on the latter problem for practical\nreasons. We show that it is a much more challenging task, as our analysis of\nthe language in the typical datasets shows that hate speech lacks unique,\ndiscriminative features and therefore is found in the 'long tail' in a dataset\nthat is difficult to discover.
