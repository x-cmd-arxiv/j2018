Methods: TG4 conducted a literature survey of four types of\nresearch studies that are typically impacted by exposure measurement error: 1)\ndietary intake cohort studies, 2) dietary intake population surveys, 3)\nphysical activity cohort studies, and 4) air pollution cohort studies. The\nsurvey was conducted to understand current practice for acknowledging and\naddressing measurement error.

Uncertainty in predictive can result from\nuncertainty in model parameters, irreducible data uncertainty and uncertainty\ndue to distributional mismatch between the test and training data\ndistributions. Different actions might be taken depending on the source of the\nuncertainty so it is important to be able to distinguish between them.\nRecently, baseline tasks and metrics have been defined and several practical\nmethods to estimate uncertainty developed.

While\nbeing the standard of care procedure, fetoscopy suffers from a limited\nfield-of-view of the placenta resulting in missed anastomoses. To facilitate\nthe task of the clinician, building a global map of the placenta providing a\nlarger overview of the vascular network is highly desired. Methods: To overcome\nthe challenging visual conditions inherent to in vivo sequences (low contrast,\nobstructions or presence of artifacts, among others), we propose the following\ncontributions: (i) robust pairwise registration is achieved by aligning the\norientation of the image gradients, and (ii) difficulties regarding long-range\nconsistency (e.g. due to the presence of outliers) is tackled via a bag-of-word\nstrategy, which identifies overlapping frames of the sequence to be registered\nregardless of their respective location in time.

We present mosaics motivating qualitatively our methodological\nchoices and demonstrating their promising aspect.

Robustness to visual\nchallenges during registration and long-range temporal consistency are\nproposed, offering first positive results on in vivo data for which standard\nmosaicking techniques are not applicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 17:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

The Coulomb problem is to\nunderstand how these superconductors avoid the strong onsite Coulomb\ninteraction at the iron atoms, while maintaining a robust transition\ntemperature. Within the dominant space of $t_{2g}$ orbitals, on-site repulsion\nin the FeSCs enforces two linearly independent components of the condensate to\nvanish.

Although many methods\nexist, the No Free Lunch theorem for community detection implies that each\nmakes some kind of tradeoff, and no algorithm can be optimal on all inputs.\nThus, different algorithms will over or underfit on different inputs, finding\nmore, fewer, or just different communities than is optimal, and evaluation\nmethods that use a metadata partition as a ground truth will produce misleading\nconclusions about general accuracy. Here, we present a broad evaluation of over\nand underfitting in community detection, comparing the behavior of 16\nstate-of-the-art community detection algorithms on a novel and structurally\ndiverse corpus of 406 real-world networks. We find that (i) algorithms vary\nwidely both in the number of communities they find and in their corresponding\ncomposition, given the same input, (ii) algorithms can be clustered into\ndistinct high-level groups based on similarities of their outputs on real-world\nnetworks, and (iii) these differences induce wide variation in accuracy on link\nprediction and link description tasks. We introduce a new diagnostic for\nevaluating overfitting and underfitting in practice, and use it to roughly\ndivide community detection methods into general and specialized learning\nalgorithms. Across methods and inputs, Bayesian techniques based on the\nstochastic block model and a minimum description length approach to\nregularization represent the best general learning approach, but can be\noutperformed under specific circumstances.

In the untyped\nsetting, we instead exhibit the missing operand via ad-hoc instantiation of the\neta-expansion rule, which allows the traversal to proceed as if the operand\nexisted in the original term. This gives rise to a more generic concept of\ntraversals for lambda terms. A notable improvement, in addition to handling\nuntyped terms, is that no preliminary transformation is required: the original\nunaltered lambda term is traversed.\n  We show that by bounding the non-determinism of the traversal rule for free\nvariables, one can effectively compute a set of traversals characterizing the\npaths in the tree representation of the beta-normal form, when it exists. This\nyields an evaluation algorithm for untyped lambda-terms. We prove correctness\nby showing that traversals implement leftmost linear reduction, a\ngeneralization of the head linear reduction of Danos et. al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 18:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

The pressure-based\nmethodology introduced in Berm\\'udez et al. 2014 and Busto et al. 2018 for\nviscous incompressible flows is extended here to solve the compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations. Instead of considering the classical system including\nthe energy conservation equation, we replace it by the pressure evolution\nequation written in non-conservative form. To ease the discretization of\ncomplex spatial domains, face-type unstructured staggered meshes are\nconsidered. A projection method allows the decoupling of the computation of the\ndensity and linear momentum variables from the pressure. Then, an explicit\nfinite volume scheme is used for the resolution of the transport diffusion\nequations on the dual mesh, whereas the pressure system is solved implicitly by\nusing continuous finite elements defined on the primal simplex mesh.\nConsequently, the CFL stability condition depends only on the flow velocity,\navoiding the severe time restrictions that might be imposed by the sound\nvelocity in the weakly compressible regime. High order of accuracy in space and\ntime of the transport diffusion stage is attained using a local ADER (LADER)\nmethodology. Moreover, also the CVC Kolgan-type second order in space and first\norder in time scheme is considered.

For this reason,\nthese data are increasingly collected in large cohorts, driving a need for the\ndevelopment of novel methods for their integration. Of note,\nclinical/translational studies typically provide snapshot gene and metabolite\nprofiles and, oftentimes, most metabolites are not identified. Thus, in these\ntypes of studies, pathway/network approaches that take into account the\ncomplexity of gene-metabolite relationships may neither be applicable nor\nreadily uncover novel relationships. With this in mind, we propose a simple\nlinear modeling approach to capture phenotype-specific gene-metabolite\nassociations, with the assumption that co-regulation patterns reflect\nfunctionally related genes and metabolites. The proposed linear model,\nmetabolite ~ gene + phenotype + gene:phenotype, specifically evaluates whether\ngene-metabolite relationships differ by phenotype, by testing whether the\nrelationship in one phenotype is significantly different from the relationship\nin another phenotype (via an interaction gene:phenotype p-value).

First, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope\nimaging to extract broadband photometry of the resolved stellar populations\nsurrounding this event. Using this photometry, we fit stellar evolution models\nto the color-magnitude diagrams to measure the recent star formation history\n(SFH). Modeling the photometry requires an accurate distance; therefore, we\nmeasure the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and infer a distance modulus of\n$29.47 \\pm 0.079$ to NGC~6946, or a metric distance of $7.83 \\pm 0.29$ Mpc. To\nestimate the stellar population's age, we convert the SFH and uncertainties\ninto a probabilistic distribution for the progenitor's age. The region in the\nimmediate vicinity of N6946-BH1 exhibits the youngest and most vigorous star\nformation for several hundred pc. This suggests that the progenitor is not a\nrunaway star. From these measurements, we infer an age for the BH progenitor of\n$10.6^{+14.5}_{-5.9}$ Myr. Assuming that the progenitor evolved effectively as\na single star, this corresponds to an initial mass of $17.9^{+29.9}_{-7.6}$\n$M_{\\odot}$.

Formally, the SED-derived\nmass falls within our narrowest 68\\% confidence interval; however, $91\\%$ of\nthe probability distribtuion function we measure lies below that mass, putting\nsome tension between the age and the direct-imaging results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 19:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 18:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

Recent\nexperiments showed that the force decays exponentially but the characteristic\ndecay length in a concentrated electrolyte is significantly larger than what\nliquid-state theories predict based on analysing correlation functions in the\nbulk electrolyte. Inspired by the classical Casimir effect, we consider an\nalternative mechanism for force generation, namely the confinement of density\nfluctuations in the electrolyte by the walls. We show analytically within the\nrandom phase approximation, which assumes the ions to be point charges, that\nthis fluctuation-induced force is attractive and also decays exponentially,\nalbeit with a decay length that is half of the bulk correlation length. These\npredictions change dramatically when excluded volume effects are accounted for\nwithin the mean spherical approximation. At high ion concentrations the Casimir\nforce is found to be exponentially damped oscillatory as a function of the\ndistance between the confining surfaces.

Analysis of the 275\nF-K stars shows that excess emission from a debris disc was detected around 47\nstars, giving a detection rate of 17.1+2.6-2.3 per cent, with lower rates for\nlater spectral types. For each target a blackbody spectrum was fitted to the\ndust emission to determine its fractional luminosity and temperature. The\nderived under- lying distribution of fractional luminosity versus blackbody\nradius in the population showed that most detected discs are concentrated at f\n~ 10^-5 and at temperatures corresponding to blackbody radii 7-40 AU, which\nscales to ~40 AU for realistic dust properties (similar to the current Kuiper\nbelt). Two outlying populations are also evident; five stars have exceptionally\nbright emission ( f > 5x10^-5), and one has unusually hot dust < 4 AU. The\nexcess emission distributions at all wavelengths were fitted with a\nsteady-state evolution model, showing these are compatible with all stars being\nborn with a narrow belt that then undergoes collisional grinding. However, the\nmodel cannot explain the hot dust systems - likely originating in transient\nevents - and bright emission systems - arising potentially from atypically\nmassive discs or recent stirring.

A nested\ncoding approach such as partitioned codes can handle both permanent defects and\ntransient errors by using two parts of redundancy: 1) redundancy to deal with\npermanent defects and 2) redundancy for transient errors. We consider two\ndifferent channel models of the binary defect and erasure channel (BDEC) and\nthe binary defect and symmetric channel (BDSC). The transient errors of the\nBDEC are erasures and the BDSC's transient errors are modeled by the binary\nsymmetric channel, respectively. Asymptotically, the probability of recovery\nfailure can converge to zero if the capacity region conditions of nested codes\nare satisfied. However, the probability of recovery failure of finite-length\nnested codes can be significantly variable for different redundancy allocations\neven though they all satisfy the capacity region conditions. Hence, we\nformulate the redundancy allocation problem of finite-length nested codes to\nminimize the recovery failure probability.

The scales at which\nthe functional properties of these materials emerge are difficult to model,\nespecially in the reversible regime where such properties result from many\nbinding/unbinding events. This difficulty is related to large entropic barriers\nassociated with the formation of intra-molecular loops. In this work we present\na simulation scheme that sidesteps configurational costs by dedicated Monte\nCarlo moves capable of binding/unbinding reactive sites in a single step.\nCross-linking reactions are implemented by trial moves that reconstruct chain\nsections attempting, at the same time, a dimerization reaction between pairs of\nreactive sites. The model is parametrized by the reaction equilibrium constant\nof the reactive species free in solution. This quantity can be obtained by\nmeans of experiments or atomistic/quantum simulations. We use the proposed\nmethodology to study self-assembly of single--chain polymeric nanoparticles,\nstarting from flexible precursors carrying regularly or randomly distributed\nreactive sites.

We focus on understanding differences in the morphology\nof chain nanoparticles when linkages are reversible as compared to the well\nstudied case of irreversible reactions.

The local induction approximation is the lowest order\napproximation to the Biot-Savart velocity field induced by a vortex line and,\nbecause of its integrability, is thought to prohibit energy transfer by Kelvin\nwaves.

For\ngeneralized neighbor matching to estimate individual and average treatment\neffects, we analyze the use of autoencoders for dimensionality reduction while\nmaintaining the local neighborhood structure among the data points in the\nembedding space. This deep learning based technique is shown to perform better\nthan simple k nearest neighbor matching for estimating treatment effects,\nespecially when the data points have several features/covariates but reside in\na low dimensional manifold in high dimensional space.

However, unlike\nconventional CoMP, each base station in N-NOMA opportunistically serves an\nextra user, referred to as the NOMA user, while serving the CoMP user at the\nsame bandwidth. The CoMP user is typically located at the cell-edge, whereas\nusers close to the base stations are scheduled as NOMA users. Hence, the\nchannel conditions of the two kind of users are very distinctive, which\nfacilitates the implementation of NOMA. Compared to the conventional orthogonal\nmultiple access based CoMP scheme, where multiple base stations serve a single\nCoMP user only, the proposed N-NOMA scheme can support larger connectivity by\nserving the extra NOMA users, and improve the spectral efficiency by avoiding\nthe CoMP user solely occupying the spectrum. A stochastic geometry approach is\napplied to model the considered N-NOMA scenario as a Poisson cluster process,\nbased on which closed-form analytical expressions for outage probabilities and\nergodic rates are obtained.

Shape of the reconstructed spectra can then be\nused to probe the origin of tensor modes in a model-independent manner. We use\nthe Fisher matrix to calculate the covariance matrix of tensor power spectra\nreconstructed in bins.

The error bar between these two wavenumbers is\nlarger because of lack of the signal between the reionization and recombination\nbumps. The error bars increase sharply towards smaller (larger) wavenumbers\nbecause of the cosmic variance (CMB lensing and instrumental noise).

However, previous approaches\neither omit or fail to fully utilize the ordered, hierarchical, and flexible\nstructures of language objects, as well as the interactions between them. In\nthis paper, we propose Hierarchical Sentence Factorization---a technique to\nfactorize a sentence into a hierarchical representation, with the components at\neach different scale reordered into a \"predicate-argument\" form. The proposed\nsentence factorization technique leads to the invention of: 1) a new\nunsupervised distance metric which calculates the semantic distance between a\npair of text snippets by solving a penalized optimal transport problem while\npreserving the logical relationship of words in the reordered sentences, and 2)\nnew multi-scale deep learning models for supervised semantic training, based on\nfactorized sentence hierarchies. We apply our techniques to text-pair\nsimilarity estimation and text-pair relationship classification tasks, based on\nmultiple datasets such as STSbenchmark, the Microsoft Research paraphrase\nidentification (MSRP) dataset, the SICK dataset, etc. Extensive experiments\nshow that the proposed hierarchical sentence factorization can be used to\nsignificantly improve the performance of existing unsupervised distance-based\nmetrics as well as multiple supervised deep learning models based on the\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 02:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

The previous three eruptions of M31N 2008-12a\nhave displayed remarkably homogeneous multi-wavelength properties: (i) From a\nfaint peak, the optical light curve declined rapidly by two magnitudes in less\nthan two days; (ii) Early spectra showed initial high velocities that slowed\ndown significantly within days and displayed clear He/N lines throughout; (iii)\nThe supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase of the nova began extremely early, six\ndays after eruption, and only lasted for about two weeks.

Early theoretical models suggest that these three\ndifferent effects can be consistently understood as caused by a lower\nquiescence mass-accretion rate. The corresponding higher ignition mass caused a\nbrighter peak in the free-free emission model. The less-massive accretion disk\nexperienced greater disruption, consequently delaying re-establishment of\neffective accretion.

CF models do not perform well in scenarios in which\nfeedback data is not available, in cold start situations like new product\nlaunches, and situations with markedly different customer tiers (e.g., high\nfrequency customers vs. casual customers). Generative natural language models\nthat create useful theme-based representations of an underlying corpus of\ndocuments can be used to represent new product descriptions, like new movie\nplots. When combined with CF, they have shown to increase the performance in\ncold start situations.

In recent years, the popularity of scalar quantization\nfor value-sharing applications has been soaring as it has been found huge\nutilities in reducing the complexity of neural networks. Existing\nclustering-based quantization techniques, while being well-developed, have\nmultiple drawbacks including the dependency of the random seed, empty or\nout-of-the-range clusters, and high time complexity for a large number of\nclusters. To overcome these problems, in this paper, the problem of scalar\nquantization is examined from a new perspective, namely sparse least square\noptimization. Specifically, inspired by the property of sparse least square\nregression, several quantization algorithms based on $l_1$ least square are\nproposed. In addition, similar schemes with $l_1 + l_2$ and $l_0$\nregularization are proposed. Furthermore, to compute quantization results with\na given amount of values/clusters, this paper designed an iterative method and\na clustering-based method, and both of them are built on sparse least square.\nThe paper shows that the latter method is mathematically equivalent to an\nimproved version of k-means clustering-based quantization algorithm, although\nthe two algorithms originated from different intuitions. The algorithms\nproposed were tested with three types of data and their computational\nperformances, including information loss, time consumption, and the\ndistribution of the values of the sparse vectors, were compared and analyzed.\nThe paper offers a new perspective to probe the area of quantization, and the\nalgorithms proposed can outperform existing methods especially under some\nbit-width reduction scenarios, when the required post-quantization resolution\n(number of values) is not significantly lower than the original number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 04:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 16:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 04:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

A\ndrawback of this naive approach is that the uncertainty in the missing entries\nis not properly incorporated in the prediction. In order to evaluate prediction\nuncertainty, the multiple imputation (MI) approach has been studied, but the\nperformance of MI is sensitive to the choice of the probabilistic model of the\ntrue values in the missing entries, and the computational cost of MI is high\nbecause multiple models must be trained.

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, an eigen-inference (EI)\nprecoding scheme to improve the error performance of the coarsely quantized\nmassive MU-MIMO systems under imperfect CSI, which is mathematically modeled by\na sum of two rectangular random matrices (RRMs). Instead of performing analysis\nbased on the RRM, using Girko's Hermitization trick, the proposed method\nleverages the block random matrix theory by augmenting the RRM into a block\nsymmetric channel matrix (BSCA). Specially, we derive the empirical\ndistribution of the eigenvalues of the BSCA and establish the limiting spectra\ndistribution connection between the true BSCA and its noisy observation. Then,\nbased on these theoretical results, we propose an EI-based moments matching\nmethod for CSI-related noise level estimation and a rotation invariant\nestimation method for CSI reconstruction.

Sponsored search (SS) auction, due to the randomness of user query\nbehavior and platform nature, usually adopts keyword-level bidding strategies.\nIn contrast, the display advertising (DA), as a relatively simpler scenario for\nauction, has taken advantage of real-time bidding (RTB) to boost the\nperformance for advertisers. In this paper, we consider the RTB problem in\nsponsored search auction, named SS-RTB. SS-RTB has a much more complex dynamic\nenvironment, due to stochastic user query behavior and more complex bidding\npolicies based on multiple keywords of an ad. Most previous methods for DA\ncannot be applied. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) solution for\nhandling the complex dynamic environment. Although some RL methods have been\nproposed for online advertising, they all fail to address the \"environment\nchanging\" problem: the state transition probabilities vary between two days.\nMotivated by the observation that auction sequences of two days share similar\ntransition patterns at a proper aggregation level, we formulate a robust MDP\nmodel at hour-aggregation level of the auction data and propose a\ncontrol-by-model framework for SS-RTB. Rather than generating bid prices\ndirectly, we decide a bidding model for impressions of each hour and perform\nreal-time bidding accordingly.

Consequently, they\nneglect the transport of mass density by the medium atoms. We have recently\npresented foundations of a covariant theory of light propagation in a\nnondispersive medium by considering a light wave simultaneously with the\ndynamics of the medium atoms driven by optoelastic forces [Phys. Rev. A 95,\n063850 (2017)]. In particular, we have shown that the mass is transferred by an\natomic mass density wave (MDW), which gives rise to mass-polariton (MP)\nquasiparticles, i.e., covariant coupled states of the field and matter having a\nnonzero rest mass. Another key observation of the mass-polariton theory of\nlight is that, in common semiconductors, most of the momentum of light is\ntransferred by moving atoms, e.g., 92% in the case of silicon. In this work, we\ngeneralize the MP theory of light for dispersive media and consider\nexperimental measurement of the mass transferred by the MDW atoms when an\nintense light pulse propagates in a silicon fiber. In particular, we consider\noptimal intensity and time dependence of a Gaussian pulse and account for the\nbreakdown threshold irradiance of the material. The optical shock wave property\nof the MDW, which propagates with the velocity of light instead of the velocity\nof sound, prompts for engineering of novel device concepts like very high\nfrequency mechanical oscillators not limited by the acoustic cutoff frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 09:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

In dense machine-to-machine networks, MTDs are typically\nlocated within close proximity and will gather correlated data, and, thus,\nclustering MTDs based on data correlation will lead to a decrease in the number\nof redundant bits transmitted to the base station. To analyze this clustering\nproblem, a novel utility function that captures the average MTD transmission\npower per cluster is derived, as a function of the MTD location, cluster size,\nand inter-cluster interference. Then, the clustering problem is formulated as\nan evolutionary game, which models the interactions among the massive number of\nMTDs, in order to decrease MTD transmission power. To solve this game, a\ndistributed algorithm is proposed to allow the infinite number of MTDs to\nautonomously form clusters. It is shown that the proposed distributed algorithm\nconverges to an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), that is robust to a small\nportion of MTDs deviating from the stable cluster formation at convergence. The\nmaximum fraction of MTDs that can deviate from the ESS, while still maintaining\na stable cluster formation is derived. Simulation results show that the\nproposed approach can effectively cluster MTDs with highly correlated data,\nwhich, in turn, enables those MTDs to eliminate a large number of redundant\nbits. The results show that, on average, using the proposed approach yields\nreductions of up to 23.4% and 9.6% in terms of the transmit power per cluster,\ncompared to forming clusters with the maximum possible size and uniformly\nselecting a cluster size, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 10:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

We discuss here several MPs by comparing the experimental\nJ-V characteristics with simulated ones using the dynamic electrical model\n(DEM). Pre-poling conditions and bias scan rate can have a dramatic influence\nnot only on the apparent solar cell performance, but also on the hysteretic\nphenomena.

Furthermore, forward-reverse and\nreverse-forward bias scans show qualitatively different behaviors regarding the\ntype of the hysteresis, normal and inverted, depending on the bias pre-poling.\nWe emphasize here that correlated forward-reverse or reverse-forward bias scans\nare essential for a correct assessment of the dynamic hysteresis. In this\ncontext, we define a hysteresis index which consistently assigns the hysteresis\ntype and magnitude. Our DEM simulations, supported by experimental data,\nprovide further guidance for an efficient and accurate determination of the\nstationary J-V characteristics, showing that the type and magnitude of the\ndynamic hysteresis may be affected by unintentional pre-conditioning in typical\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 10:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 19:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

We present the analyses of a small-scale short-duration\nevent originating from a small region. The impulsive phase of the M1.9-class\nflare lasted only for four minutes. The kinematic evolution of the CME hot\nchannel reveals some exceptional characteristics including a very short\nduration of the main acceleration phase ($<$ 2 minutes), a rather high maximal\nacceleration rate ($\\sim$50 km s$^{-2}$) and peak velocity ($\\sim$1800 km\ns$^{-1}$). The fast and impulsive kinematics subsequently results in a\npiston-driven shock related to a metric type II radio burst with a high\nstarting frequency of $\\sim$320 MHz of the fundamental band. The type II source\nis formed at a low height of below $1.1~\\mathrm{R_{\\odot}}$ less than $\\sim2$\nminutes after the onset of the main acceleration phase.

We demonstrate that\nour proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match\naccurately the first- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of\nneurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied\nSpike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it\nperforms as well as state-of-the-art approaches based on the maximum entropy\nand the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not\nrequire to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so\nconstitutes a more flexible method than these alternative approaches. Finally,\nwe show how to exploit a trained Spike-GAN to construct 'importance maps' to\ndetect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train.\nSpike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic\nspiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the\nlarge-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems\nneuroscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 12:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 08:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

One standard application of MUBs is the task\nknown as quantum random access code (QRAC), in which classical information is\nencoded in a quantum system, and later part of it is recovered by performing a\nquantum measurement. We analyse a specific class of QRACs, known as the $2^{d}\n\\to 1$ QRAC, in which two classical dits are encoded in a $d$-dimensional\nquantum system. It is known that among rank-1 projective measurements MUBs give\nthe best performance. We show (for every $d$) that this cannot be improved by\nemploying non-projective measurements. Moreover, we show that the optimal\nperformance can only be achieved by measurements which are rank-1 projective\nand mutually unbiased.

The new approach allows to construct more robust entanglement\nindicators against photon-loss noise, which can detect entangled optical states\nin situations in which witnesses using standard Stokes operators fail. Here we\nshow an extension of this approach beyond phenomena linked with polarization.\nWe discuss EPR-like experiments involving correlations produced by optical\nbeams in a multi-mode bright squeezed vacuum state. EPR-inspired entanglement\nconditions for all prime numbers of modes are presented. The conditions are\nmuch more resistant to noise due to photon loss than similar ones which employ\nstandard Glauber-like intensity, correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 14:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

The DSL compilers have to build their own complex middle-ends before\nthey can target a common back-end such as LLVM, which only handles single\ninstruction streams with SIMD instructions. We introduce Tiramisu, a common\nmiddle-end that can generate efficient code for modern processors and\naccelerators such as multicores, GPUs, FPGAs and distributed clusters. Tiramisu\nintroduces a novel three-level IR that separates the algorithm, how that\nalgorithm is executed, and where intermediate data are stored. This separation\nsimplifies optimization and makes targeting multiple hardware architectures\nfrom the same algorithm easier. As a result, DSL compilers can be made\nconsiderably less complex with no loss of performance while immediately\ntargeting multiple hardware or hardware combinations such as distributed nodes\nwith both CPUs and GPUs. We evaluated Tiramisu by creating a new middle-end for\nthe Halide and Julia compilers. We show that Tiramisu extends Halide and Julia\nwith many new capabilities including the ability to: express new algorithms\n(such as recurrent filters and non-rectangular iteration spaces), perform new\ncomplex loop nest transformations (such as wavefront parallelization, loop\nshifting and loop fusion) and generate efficient code for more architectures\n(such as combinations of distributed clusters, multicores, GPUs and FPGAs).\nFinally, we demonstrate that Tiramisu can generate very efficient code that\nmatches the highly optimized Intel MKL gemm (generalized matrix multiplication)\nimplementation, we also show speedups reaching 4X in Halide and 16X in Julia\ndue to optimizations enabled by Tiramisu.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 17:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 13:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 19:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

Thus, only\nsimple aggregated summary statistics are typically transferred with just a\nsingle call. This does not allow for more complex tasks such as variable\nselection. As an alternative, we propose a multivariable regression approach\nfor identifying important markers by automatic variable selection based on\naggregated data from different locations in iterative calls. To minimize the\namount of transferred data and the number of calls, we also provide a heuristic\nvariant of the approach. When performing a global data standardization, the\nproposed methods yields the same results as when pooling individual-level data.\nIn a simulation study, the information loss introduced by a local\nstandardization is seen to be minimal.

We find that our model is consistent with various\nenergy conditions and also satisfies Herrera's cracking condition, TOV\nequation, static stability criteria of Harrison-Zel$'$dovich-Novikov etc. The\nvalue of the adiabatic indices as well as the EOS parameters re-establish the\nacceptability of our model. Here in detail we have studied specifically three\ndifferent strange star candidates, viz. $PSRJ~1614~2230, Vela~X-1$ and\n$Cen~X-3$. As a whole, present model fulfils all the criteria for stability.\nAnother fascinating point we have discussed is the value of the bag constant\nwhich lies in the range $(40-45)$~MeV/fm$^{3}$. This is quite smaller than the\npredicted range, i.e., $(55-75)$~MeV/fm$^{3}$ ~\\cite{Farhi1984,Alcock1986}. The\npresence of the constant ($\\chi$), arises due to the coupling between matter\nand geometry, is responsible behind this reduction in $B_g$ value. For\n$\\chi=0$, we get the higher value for $B_g$ as the above mentioned predicted\nrange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 18:37:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 15:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

Here we\ninvestigated how a single spiking neuron can optimally respond to one given\npattern (localist coding), or to either one of several patterns (distributed\ncoding, i.e. the neuron's response is ambiguous but the identity of the pattern\ncould be inferred from the response of multiple neurons), but not to random\ninputs. To do so, we extended a theory developed in a previous paper\n[Masquelier, 2017], which was limited to localist coding. More specifically, we\ncomputed analytically the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a\nmulti-pattern-detector neuron, using a threshold-free leaky integrate-and-fire\n(LIF) neuron model with non-plastic unitary synapses and homogeneous Poisson\ninputs. Surprisingly, when increasing the number of patterns, the SNR decreases\nslowly, and remains acceptable for several tens of independent patterns.\n  In addition, we investigated whether spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)\ncould enable a neuron to reach the theoretical optimal SNR. To this aim, we\nsimulated a LIF equipped with STDP, and repeatedly exposed it to multiple input\nspike patterns, embedded in equally dense Poisson spike trains. The LIF\nprogressively became selective to every repeating pattern with no supervision,\nand stopped discharging during the Poisson spike trains. Furthermore, using\ncertain STDP parameters, the resulting pattern detectors were optimal. Tens of\nindependent patterns could be learned by a single neuron using a low adaptive\nthreshold, in contrast with previous studies, in which higher thresholds led to\nlocalist coding only.\n  Taken together these results suggest that coincidence detection and STDP are\npowerful mechanisms, fully compatible with distributed coding. Yet we\nacknowledge that our theory is limited to single neurons, and thus also applies\nto feed-forward networks, but not to recurrent ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 15:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 08:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 12:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 08:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

In particular, we propose two different variations, one based on\na cascade of multiple CRFs, the other on a unified graphical model. By\ndesigning a novel CNN implementation of mean-field updates for continuous CRFs,\nwe show that both proposed models can be regarded as sequential deep networks\nand that training can be performed end-to-end. Through an extensive\nexperimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach and establish new state of the art results for the monocular depth\nestimation task on three publicly available datasets, i.e. NYUD-V2, Make3D and\nKITTI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 07:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

However, its performance is severely restricted by the current\ncontext-vector-based sub-solution evaluation method since this method needs to\naccess the original high dimensional simulation model when evaluating each\nsub-solution and thus requires many computation resources. To alleviate this\nissue, this study proposes an adaptive surrogate model assisted CC framework.\nThis framework adaptively constructs surrogate models for different\nsub-problems by fully considering their characteristics. For the single\ndimensional sub-problems obtained through decomposition, accurate enough\nsurrogate models can be obtained and used to find out the optimal solutions of\nthe corresponding sub-problems directly. As for the nonseparable sub-problems,\nthe surrogate models are employed to evaluate the corresponding sub-solutions,\nand the original simulation model is only adopted to reevaluate some good\nsub-solutions selected by surrogate models. By these means, the computation\ncost could be greatly reduced without significantly sacrificing evaluation\nquality. Empirical studies on IEEE CEC 2010 benchmark functions show that the\nconcrete algorithm based on this framework is able to find much better\nsolutions than the conventional CC algorithms and a non-CC algorithm even with\nmuch fewer computation resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 01:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic\nauthentication of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning\nframework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT\ndevices (IoTDs) to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated\nsignal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method\nenables the cloud, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively\nauthenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT\nscenarios, since the cloud cannot authenticate all the IoTDs simultaneously due\nto computational limitations, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to improve\nthe cloud's decision making process by predicting vulnerable IoTDs. The\nmixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived and the\nuniqueness of the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive\nIoT system, due to a large set of available actions for the cloud, it is shown\nthat analytically deriving the MSNE is challenging and, thus, a learning\nalgorithm proposed that converges to the MSNE. Moreover, in order to cope with\nthe incomplete information case in which the cloud cannot access the state of\nthe unauthenticated IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed\nto dynamically predict the state of unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the cloud\nto decide on which IoTDs to authenticate.

Thereinafter, the evolution of the flat FRW universe, filled by a\npressureless source and the obtained dark energy candidate, is studied. In our\nmodel, there is no mutual interaction between the cosmos sectors. We find out\nthat the obtained model is theoretically powerful to explain the current\naccelerated phase of the universe.

It plays a fundamental role in mathematics and computer\nscience. The Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem provides a formula for the earth\nmover's distance on the space of regular probability Borel measures on a\ncompact metric space. In this paper, we investigate the quantum earth mover's\ndistance. We show a no-go Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem in the quantum\nsetting. More precisely, we show that the trace distance between two quantum\nstates can not be determined by their earth mover's distance. The technique\nhere is to track the bipartite quantum marginal problem. Then we provide\ninequality to describe the structure of quantum coupling, which can be regarded\nas quantum generalization of Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem. After that, we\ngeneralize it to obtain into the tripartite version, and build a new class of\nnecessary criteria for the tripartite marginal problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 00:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 09:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

It has been proved that the consideration of\nmulti-scale local neighborhood improves the performance of the descriptor,\nthough at the cost of increased dimension. This paper proposes a novel method\nto construct a local descriptor using multi-scale neighborhood by finding the\nlocal directional order among the intensity values at different scales in a\nparticular direction. Local directional order is the multi-radius relationship\nfactor in a particular direction. The proposed local directional order pattern\n(LDOP) for a particular pixel is computed by finding the relationship between\nthe center pixel and local directional order indexes. It is required to\ntransform the center value into the range of neighboring orders. Finally, the\nhistogram of LDOP is computed over whole image to construct the descriptor. In\ncontrast to the state-of-the-art descriptors, the dimension of the proposed\ndescriptor does not depend upon the number of neighbors involved to compute the\norder; it only depends upon the number of directions. The introduced descriptor\nis evaluated over the image retrieval framework and compared with the\nstate-of-the-art descriptors over challenging face databases such as PaSC, LFW,\nPubFig, FERET, AR, AT&T, and ExtendedYale. The experimental results confirm the\nsuperiority and robustness of the LDOP descriptor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 16:04:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 05:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}
