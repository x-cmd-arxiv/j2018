The QTFs help to determine\na real-time range that excludes outliers. This range is fed into the CMTF which\nis responsible for mitigating impulsive noise. The CMTF is a nonlinear analog\nfilter and its nonlinearity is controlled by the aforementioned range. Proper\nselection of this range ensures the improvement of the desired signal quality\nin impulsive environment. It is important to note that the proposed ACDL\nbehaves like a linear filter in case of no impulsive noise. In this context,\nthe traditional matched filter construction is modified to ensure\ndistortionless processing of the desired signal. The performance improvement of\nthe proposed ACDL is due to the fact that unlike other nonlinear methods, the\nACDL is implemented in the analog domain where the outliers are still broadband\nand distinguishable. Simulation results in PRIME (OFDM-based narrowband PLC\nsystem) demonstrate the superior BER performance of ACDL relative to other\nnonlinear approaches such as blanking and clipping in impulsive noise\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 16:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

Traditionally, the design of repeated auctions requires\nstrong modeling assumptions about the bidder behavior, such as it being myopic,\ninfinite lookahead, or some specific form of learning behavior. Is it possible\nto design mechanisms which are simultaneously optimal against a multitude of\npossible buyer behaviors? We answer this question by designing a simple\nstate-based mechanism that is simultaneously approximately optimal against a\n$k$-lookahead buyer for all $k$, a buyer who is a no-regret learner, and a\nbuyer who is a policy-regret learner. Against each type of buyer our mechanism\nattains a constant fraction of the optimal revenue attainable against that type\nof buyer. We complement our positive results with almost tight impossibility\nresults, showing that the revenue approximation tradeoffs achieved by our\nmechanism for different lookahead attitudes are near-optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 16:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2019 05:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

This paper offers an optimized\ndecomposition strategy for the external schema, which concentrates on the\nprivacy policy and required associations of attributes for the intended user\nroles. The method proposed in this article performs a proactive decomposition\nof the external schema, in order to satisfy both the forbidden and required\nassociations of attributes.Functional dependency constraints of a database\nschema can be represented as a graph, in which vertices are attribute sets and\nedges are functional dependencies. In this representation, inference problem\ncan be defined as a process of searching a subtree in the dependency graph\ncontaining the attributes that need to be related. The optimized decomposition\nprocess aims to generate an external schema, which guarantees the prevention of\nthe inference of the forbidden attribute sets while guaranteeing the\nassociation of the required attribute sets with a minimal loss of possible\nassociation among other attributes, if the inhibited and required attribute\nsets are consistent with each other. Our technique is purely proactive, and can\nbe viewed as a normalization process. Due to the usage independency of external\nschema construction tools, it can be easily applied to any existing systems\nwithout rewriting data access layer of applications.

This result is consistent\nwith the recent infall of a low mass metal-poor dwarf or HI cloud into the\nregion now exhibiting the lowest metallicity, which also displays localized\nperturbed neutral and ionized gas kinematics. Mrk 600 in contrast, appears to\nbe chemically homogeneous on both large and small scales. The intrinsic\ndifferences in the spatially resolved properties of the ISM in our analysed\ngalaxies are consistent with these systems being at different evolutionary\nstages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 18:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an atomic ion\ndriven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy\nmeasurement. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are\nreputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. Can there be, despite the\nindeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump is\nabout to occur or not? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by\nexperimentally demonstrating that the jump from the ground to an excited state\nof a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a\npredictable \"flight,\" by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level\ncoupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the jump\nevolution when completed is continuous, coherent, and deterministic.\nFurthermore, exploiting these features and using real-time monitoring and\nfeedback, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus\ndeterministically preventing its completion.

Within the Hilbert space of matter fields defined on a spatial\nmanifold, we consider a sub-Hilbert space spanned by states which are\nparameterized by spatial metric. In those states, metric is introduced as a\ncollective variable that controls local structures of entanglement. The\nunderlying matter fields endow the states labeled by metric with an unambiguous\ninner product. Then we construct a Hamiltonian for the matter fields that is an\nendomorphism of the sub-Hilbert space, thereby inducing a quantum Hamiltonian\nof the metric. It is shown that there exists a matter Hamiltonian that induces\nthe general relativity in the semi-classical field theory limit. Although the\nHamiltonian is not local in the absolute sense, it has a weaker notion of\nlocality, called relative locality : the range of interactions is set by the\nentanglement present in target states on which the Hamiltonian acts. In\ngeneral, normalizable states are not invariant under the transformations\ngenerated by the Hamiltonian. As a result, a physical state spontaneously\nbreaks the Hamiltonian constraint, and picks a moment of time. The subsequent\nflow of time can be understood as a Goldstone mode associated with the broken\nsymmetry. The construction allows one to study dynamics of gravity from the\nperspective of matter fields. The Hawking radiation corresponds to a unitary\nevolution where entanglement across horizon is gradually transferred from color\ndegrees of freedom to singlet degrees of freedom. The underlying quantum states\nremain pure as evaporating black holes keep entanglement with early Hawking\nradiations in the singlet sector which is not captured by the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2018 18:55:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 04:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 14:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 03:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

In this case, aLIGO will be sensitive to the lower-mass rungs\nof the merger ladder, ranging from the seed BH mass to masses >~50-300 Msun,\nwhere the background from standard mergers is expected to be very low. Assuming\nthis generic IMBH formation scenario, we calculate the mass functions that\ncorrespond to the limiting cases of possible merger trees.

However, due to the complex internal structure of\nthe scaffolds, whole scaffold calculations of the local shear forces are\ncomputationally-intensive. Instead, representative volume elements (RVEs),\nwhich are obtained by extracting smaller portions of the scaffold, are commonly\nused in literature without a numerical accuracy standard. Hence, the goal of\nthis study is to examine how closely the whole scaffold simulations are\napproximated by the two types of boundary conditions used to enable the RVEs:\n\"wall boundary condition\" (WBC) and \"periodic boundary condition\" (PBC). To\nthat end, Lattice-Boltzmann Method fluid dynamics simulations were used to\nmodel the surface shear stresses in 3D scaffold reconstructions, obtained from\nhigh resolution microcomputed tomography images. It was found that despite the\nRVEs being sufficiently larger than 6 times the scaffold pore size (which is\nthe only accuracy guideline found in literature), the stresses were still\nsignificantly under-predicted by both types of boundary conditions: between 20\nand 80% average error, depending on the scaffold's porosity. Moreover, it was\nfound that the error grew with higher porosity. This is likely due to the small\npores dominating the flow field, and thereby negating the effects of the\nunrealistic boundary conditions, when the scaffold porosity is small. Finally,\nit was found that the PBC was always more accurate and computationally\nefficient than the WBC. Therefore, it is the recommended type of RVE.

Recent progress in\nfew-shot classification has featured meta-learning, in which a parameterized\nmodel for a learning algorithm is defined and trained on episodes representing\ndifferent classification problems, each with a small labeled training set and\nits corresponding test set. In this work, we advance this few-shot\nclassification paradigm towards a scenario where unlabeled examples are also\navailable within each episode. We consider two situations: one where all\nunlabeled examples are assumed to belong to the same set of classes as the\nlabeled examples of the episode, as well as the more challenging situation\nwhere examples from other distractor classes are also provided. To address this\nparadigm, we propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al.,\n2017) that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when\nproducing prototypes. These models are trained in an end-to-end way on\nepisodes, to learn to leverage the unlabeled examples successfully. We evaluate\nthese methods on versions of the Omniglot and miniImageNet benchmarks, adapted\nto this new framework augmented with unlabeled examples.

The crux of the problem lies in the combinatorial\nnature of multi-user offloading decisions, the complexity of the optimization\nobjective, and the existence of inter-cell interference. Then, we decompose the\nunderlying problem into two subproblems: i) the offloading decision, which\nincludes two phases of user association and subchannel assignment, and ii)\njoint resource allocation, which can be further decomposed into the problems of\ntransmit power and computation resource allocation. To enable distributed\ncomputation offloading, we sequentially apply a many-to-one matching game for\nuser association and a one-to-one matching game for subchannel assignment.\nMoreover, the transmit power of offloading users is found using a bisection\nmethod with approximate inter-cell interference, and the computation resources\nallocated to offloading users is achieved via the duality approach.

To\ngain insight into the exfoliation possibility of MAX phases and to identify\nwhich MAX phases are promising candidates for successful exfoliation into 2D\nMXenes, we perform extensive electronic structure and phonon calculations, and\ndetermine the force constants, bond strengths, and static exfoliation energies\nof MAX phases to MXenes for 82 different experimentally synthesized crystalline\nMAX phases. Our results show a clear correlation between the force constants\nand the bond strengths. As the total force constant of an \"A\" atom contributed\nfrom the neighboring atoms is smaller, the exfoliation energy becomes smaller,\nthus making exfoliation easier.

In addition, we\nexplore the effect of charge injection on MAX phases. We find that the injected\ncharges, both electrons and holes, are mainly received by the transition\nmetals. This is due to the electronic property of MAX phases that the states\nnear the Fermi energy are mainly dominated by $d$ orbitals of the transition\nmetals. For negatively charged MAX phases, the electrons injected cause\nswelling of the structure and elongation of the bond distances along the $c$\naxis, which hence weakens the binding.

However, an important usability issue - verification - limits the\neffective use of such PBE data transformation systems, since the verification\nprocess is often effort-consuming and unreliable. We propose a data\ntransformation paradigm design CLX (pronounced \"clicks\") with a focus on\nfacilitating verification for end users in a PBE-like data transformation. CLX\nperforms pattern clustering in both input and output data, which allows the\nuser to verify at the pattern level, rather than the data instance level,\nwithout having to write any regular expressions, thereby significantly reducing\nuser verification effort. Thereafter, CLX automatically generates\ntransformation programs as regular-expression replace operations that are easy\nfor average users to verify.

Secondly, we analyze the property of\nSSMDP and theoretically prove the necessity of maximizing accumulative rewards.\nLastly, we propose a novel policy gradient algorithm for learning an optimal\nranking policy, which is able to deal with the problem of high reward variance\nand unbalanced reward distribution of an SSMDP. Experiments are conducted in\nsimulation and TaoBao search engine. The results demonstrate that our algorithm\nperforms much better than online LTR methods, with more than 40% and 30% growth\nof total transaction amount in the simulation and the real application,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 03:57:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 02:31:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 11:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

The resolution of this\nimportant issue must resort to high precision cosmological simulations.\nHowever, this is hampered by another long-standing `sampling artifact' problem\nin volume weighted velocity measurement. We circumvent this problem with a\nhybrid approach. We first measure statistics free of sampling artifact, then\nlink them to volume weighted statistics in theory, finally solve for the\nvelocity bias. $b_v$ determined by our method is not only free of sampling\nartifact, but also free of cosmic variance. We apply this method to a\n$\\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation of $3072^3$ particles and $1200 Mpc/{\\rm h}$ box\nsize. For the first time, we determine the halo velocity bias to $0.1\\%$-$1\\%$\naccuracy. Our major findings are as follows: (1) $b_v\\neq 1$ at $k>0.1 h/{\\rm\nMpc}$. The deviation from unity ($|b_v-1|$) increases with $k$. Depending on\nhalo mass and redshift, it may reach $\\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ at $k=0.2 h/{\\rm Mpc}$\nand $\\mathcal{O}(0.05)$ at $k\\sim 0.3 h/{\\rm Mpc}$. The discovered $b_v\\neq 1$\nhas statistically significant impact on structure growth rate measurement by\nspectroscopic redshift surveys, including DESI, Euclid and SKA. (2) Both the\nsign and the amplitude of $b_v-1$ depend on mass and redshift. These results\ndisagree with the peak model prediction in that $b_v$ has much weaker deviation\nfrom unity, varies with redshift, and can be bigger than unity. (3) Most of the\nmass and redshift dependences can be compressed into a single dependence on the\nhalo density bias. Based on this finding, we provide an approximate\ntwo-parameter fitting formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 06:14:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 15:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

However, chronic diseases that progress\nslowly over time are often heterogeneous in their clinical presentation.\nPatients may progress through disease stages at varying rates. This leads to\npathophysiological misalignment over time, making it difficult to consistently\ncompare patients in a clinically meaningful way. Furthermore, patients present\nclinically for the first time at different stages of disease. This eliminates\nthe possibility of simply aligning patients based on their initial\npresentation. Finally, patient data may be sampled at different rates due to\ndifferences in schedules or missed visits. To address these challenges, we\npropose a robust measure of patient similarity based on subsequence alignment.\nCompared to global alignment techniques that do not account for\npathophysiological misalignment, focusing on the most relevant subsequences\nallows for an accurate measure of similarity between patients. We demonstrate\nthe utility of our approach in settings where longitudinal data, while useful,\nare limited and lack a clear temporal alignment for comparison. Applied to the\ntask of stratifying patients for risk of progression to probable Alzheimer's\nDisease, our approach outperforms models that use only snapshot data (AUROC of\n0.839 vs. 0.812) and models that use global alignment techniques (AUROC of\n0.822).

In this paper, two connected topics are\npresented. One is to investigate the Chinese National Standard and\nInternational Standard, in order to summarize all the noise limitation on low\nfrequency noise. The second topic is the application of online psychoacoustic\ntest to evaluate the influence of low frequency noise on human performance,\nwhich can enlarge the subjective testing sample size in order to facilitate the\nestablishment of related National Standard. The online Hass effect experiment\nis repeated to verify the accuracy of online psychoacoustic test.

The accuracy and finishing\ntime are taken into consideration to evaluate their performance under different\nkinds of noise.

In the first part, we show that the complexity of the problem is\nsignificantly reduced by modeling the jumps measure of the population,\ndescribed by a multivariate counting process. This process is defined as a\nsolution of a stochastic differential system with random coefficients, driven\nby a multivariate Poisson random measure. The solution is obtained under weak\nassumptions, by the thinning of a strongly dominating point process generated\nby the same Poisson measure. This key construction relies on a general strong\ncomparison result, of independent interest. The second part is dedicated to\naveraging results when swap events are significantly more frequent than\ndemographic events. An important ingredient is the stable convergence, which is\nwell-adapted to the general random environment. The pathwise construction by\ndomination yields tightness results straightforwardly.

Second, we\nobserve a time-dependent frequency shift of the ensemble-averaged oscillation.\nWe show that these effects follow from the inhomogeneity of the two-level\nsplitting across the ensemble, allowing for a distribution of local\noscillations in which those with high frequencies interfere destructively and\ndecay faster than those with a low frequency, which are the only to survive in\nthe output signal. Hence, coherence emerges from long-lived oscillations in an\ninhomogeneous ensemble. We analyze the Fourier spectrum of the time-dependent\noscillation signal and find a non-trivial spectral structure that is double\npeaked for certain parameters. We show that the effects observed in alkali\nvapor are universal and expected in any system with a moderate inhomogeneity\ndriven by an external field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 10:32:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 10:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

In the tree-adjoining grammar recognition problem, given a grammar\n$\\Gamma$ and a string $s$ of length $n$, the task is to decide whether $s$ can\nbe obtained from $\\Gamma$. Rajasekaran and Yooseph's parser (JCSS'98) solves\nthis problem in time $O(n^{2\\omega})$, where $\\omega < 2.373$ is the matrix\nmultiplication exponent. The best algorithms avoiding fast matrix\nmultiplication take time $O(n^6)$.\n  The first evidence for hardness was given by Satta (J. Comp.

We free ourselves from this limitation by\ntraining on unannotated images.\n  Our method leverages the observation that two images of the same scene but\nwith different lighting provide useful information on their intrinsic\nproperties: by definition, albedo is invariant to lighting conditions, and\ncross-combining the estimated albedo of a first image with the estimated\nshading of a second one should lead back to the second one's input image. We\ntranscribe this relationship into a siamese training scheme for a deep\nconvolutional neural network that decomposes a single image into albedo and\nshading. The siamese setting allows us to introduce a new loss function\nincluding such cross-combinations, and to train solely on (time-lapse) images,\ndiscarding the need for any ground truth annotations.\n  As a result, our method has the good properties of i) taking advantage of the\ntime-varying information of image sequences in the (pre-computed) training\nstep, ii) not requiring ground truth data to train on, and iii) being able to\ndecompose single images of unseen scenes at runtime.

Here\nwe provide an application to the case of two-body scattering with one body\nweakly interacting with its environment --- e.g. a neutron being scattered from\na H2 molecule physisorbed in a carbon nanotube.\n  In particular, we make contact with the field of incoherent inelastic neutron\nscattering from condensed systems. We provide a physically compelling\nprediction of a new quantum effect --- a momentum transfer deficit; or\nequivalently, an enhanced energy transfer; or an apparent reduction of the mass\nof the struck particle. E.g., when a neutron collides with a H2 molecule in a\nC-nanotube and excites its translational motion along the nanotube, it\napparently exchanges energy and momentum with a fictitious particle with mass\nof 0.64 atomic mass units. Experimental results are shown and discussed in the\nnew theoretical frame. The effect under consideration has no conventional\ninterpretation, thus also supporting the novelty of the quantum theoretical\nframework of WV and TVSF.

However, many contemporary face recognition models still perform\nrelatively poor in processing profile faces compared to frontal faces. A key\nreason is that the number of frontal and profile training faces are highly\nimbalanced - there are extensively more frontal training samples compared to\nprofile ones. In addition, it is intrinsically hard to learn a deep\nrepresentation that is geometrically invariant to large pose variations. In\nthis study, we hypothesize that there is an inherent mapping between frontal\nand profile faces, and consequently, their discrepancy in the deep\nrepresentation space can be bridged by an equivariant mapping. To exploit this\nmapping, we formulate a novel Deep Residual EquivAriant Mapping (DREAM) block,\nwhich is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the input deep\nrepresentation to transform a profile face representation to a canonical pose\nthat simplifies recognition. The DREAM block consistently enhances the\nperformance of profile face recognition for many strong deep networks,\nincluding ResNet models, without deliberately augmenting training data of\nprofile faces. The block is easy to use, light-weight, and can be implemented\nwith a negligible computational overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 13:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

Explaining the formation of jets in stratified turbulence is a\nfundamental problem in geophysical fluid dynamics. Statistical state dynamics\n(SSD) provides powerful methods for analyzing turbulent systems exhibiting\nemergent organization, such as banded jets. In SSD, dynamical equations are\nwritten directly for the evolution of the turbulence statistics, enabling\ndirect analysis of the statistical interactions between the incoherent\ncomponent of the turbulence and the coherent large-scale structure component\nthat underlie jet formation. A second-order closure of SSD, known as S3T, has\npreviously been applied to show that meridionally banded jets emerge in\nbarotropic beta-plane turbulence via a statistical instability referred to as\nthe zonostrophic instability. Two-dimensional Boussinesq turbulence provides a\nsimple model of non-rotating stratified turbulence analogous to the beta-plane\nmodel of planetary turbulence.

It is seen that while optical image shows the gradual degradation\nof yellowish-colored CsPbBr3 structure under daylight, UV illumination reveals\nthat the degradation of crystals takes place in two steps; transition from\nblue-emitting to green-emitting structure and and then transition from\ngreen-emitting phase to complete degradation. We found that as-synthesized\nCsPbBr3 NWs emit blue light under 254 nm UV source and before the degradation,\nfirst CsPbBr3 NWs undergoes a water-driven structural transition to form large\nbundles. It is also seen that formation of such bundles provide longer-term\nenvironmental stability. In addition theoretical calculations revealed how\nstrong is the interaction of water molecules with ligands and surfaces of\nCsPbBr3 and provide atomistic-level explanation to transition from\nligand-covered nanowires to bundle formation. Further interaction of\ngreen-light-emitting bundles with water causes complete degradation of CsPbBr3\nand photoluminescence signal is entirely quenched. Moreover, Raman and XRD\nmeasurements revealed that completely degraded regions are decomposed to PbBr2\nand CsBr precursors. We believe that findings of this study may provide further\ninsight into the degradation mechanism of CsPbBr3 perovskite by water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 13:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

We prove that the mean field quantum\nmaster equation has a unique regular stationary solution. In case a relevant\nparameter $C_\\mathfrak{b} $, i.e., the cavity cooperative parameter, is less\nthan $1$, we prove that any regular solution converges exponentially fast to\nthe equilibrium, and so the regular stationary state is a globally\nasymptotically stable equilibrium solution.

Then, the mean-field\nlaser equation has a Poincar\\'e-Andronov-Hopf bifurcation at $C_\\mathfrak{b} =1\n$ of supercritical-like type.

Moreover, we establish the\nlocal exponential stability of the limit cycle in case a relevant parameter is\nbetween the first and second laser thresholds appearing in the semiclassical\nlaser theory. Thus, we get that the coherent laser light persists over time\nunder this condition.

Current CDNs suffer from inefficient request mapping\nbased on DNS redirection, and inefficient content distribution from origin to\nedge servers, through content reflection. We proposes a novel, flexible CDN\narchitecture that removes the need for DNS-based mapping and content\nreflection. Instead, requests to/from the CDN are treated as service\ntransactions in the network, which utilises a routing function embraced from\nemerging research in Information-Centric Networks (ICN) to route edge-to-edge\ntransactions to the true nearest service point. The same function is utilized\nto establish path-based flows over a fast forwarding substrate; thereby,\neliminating the need for IP routing between service points within a single\ndomain, and potentially at peering points with other domains. We model our\narchitecture and formulate the resource placement problem as a variance of the\nK-center problem. To address the problem, we propose a greedy algorithm, Swing,\nthat balances the placement of service points between highly and poorly\nconnected nodes. We evaluate the efficiency of our architecture in utilising\nthe CDN and network resources through Monte Carlo simulations that explore a\nrange of K values.

Well established cryptographic technology is already in place\nand is expected to continue to be so.

In order to prove such potential,\nperformance analysis methods are needed that consider realistic legitimate and\neavesdropper system assumptions and non-asymptotic coding lengths. In this\npaper we propose the design of secure radio frequency (RF) satellite links with\nrealistic system assumptions. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose\na wiretap channel model for the finite-length regime. The model includes an\nstochastic wiretap encoding method using existing practical linear error\ncorrecting codes and hash codes. Secrecy is provided with privacy\namplification, for which the finite-length secrecy metric is given that upper\nbounds semantic secrecy. Second, we derive a novel RF (broadcast) satellite\nwiretap channel model that parameterizes the stochastic degraded channel around\nthe legitimate channel, a necessary condition to enable secure communication.\nFinally, we show the design of a secure satellite physical layer and\nfinite-length performance evaluation. In doing so, we define as sacrifice rate\nthe fixed fraction of the overall coding rate budget for reliability that needs\nto be allocated to secrecy. Our methodology does not make use of channel side\ninformation of the eavesdropper, only assumes worst case system assumptions.

We\ndemonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system\nchange detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems. Our examples show\nthat sparse updates to a previously identified model perform better with less\ndata, have lower runtime complexity, and are less sensitive to noise than\nidentifying an entirely new model.

Despite the importance of trust as a\nsocial and psychological concept, the concept has not gained much attention\nfrom evolutionary game theorists. In this paper, an N-player trust-based social\ndilemma game is introduced. While the theory shows that a society with no\nuntrustworthy individuals would yield maximum wealth to both the society as a\nwhole and the individuals in the long run, evolutionary dynamics show this\nideal situation is reached only in a special case when the initial population\ncontains no untrustworthy individuals. When the initial population consists of\neven the slightest number of untrustworthy individuals, the society converges\nto zero trusters, with many untrustworthy individuals. The promotion of trust\nis an uneasy task, despite the fact that a combination of trusters and\ntrustworthy trustees is the most rational and optimal social state. This paper\npresents the game and results of replicator dynamics in a hope that researchers\nin evolutionary games see opportunities in filling this critical gap in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 11:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

The system is described by an extended Hubbard model within a fully\nmicroscopic approach. Explicitly, the microscopic parameters describing the\nintra- and inter-site Coulomb interactions are determined together with the\nhopping integrals by optimizing the system ground state energy and the\nsingle-particle wave functions in the correlated state. The many-body wave\nfunction is taken in the Jastrow form and the Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC)\nmethod is used in combination with an ab initio approach to determine the\nenergy. Both the effective Bohr radii of the renormalized single-particle wave\nfunctions and the many-body wave function parameters are determined for each\n$f$. Hence, the evolution of the system can be analyzed in detail as a function\nof the equilibrium intermolecular distance, which in turn is determined for\neach $f$ value.
