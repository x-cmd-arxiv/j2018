Recent work\nindeed shows that such an algorithm would refute the Strong Exponential Time\nHypothesis (SETH) [Abboud, Backurs, Vassilevska Williams + Bringmann,\nK\\\"unnemann FOCS'15].\n  Despite the quadratic-time barrier, for over 40 years an enduring scientific\ninterest continued to produce fast algorithms for LCS and its variations.\nParticular attention was put into identifying and exploiting input parameters\nthat yield strongly subquadratic time algorithms for special cases of interest,\ne.g., differential file comparison.

In\nthis paper, using the lens of fine-grained complexity, our goal is to (1)\njustify the lack of further improvements and (2) determine whether some special\ncases of LCS admit faster algorithms than currently known.\n  To this end, we provide a systematic study of the multivariate complexity of\nLCS, taking into account all parameters previously discussed in the literature:\nthe input size $n:=\\max\\{|x|,|y|\\}$, the length of the shorter string\n$m:=\\min\\{|x|,|y|\\}$, the length $L$ of an LCS of $x$ and $y$, the numbers of\ndeletions $\\delta := m-L$ and $\\Delta := n-L$, the alphabet size, as well as\nthe numbers of matching pairs $M$ and dominant pairs $d$. For any class of\ninstances defined by fixing each parameter individually to a polynomial in\nterms of the input size, we prove a SETH-based lower bound matching one of\nthree known algorithms.

Our contribution is twofold: first, we\nderive a tractable upper bound to the per-sample gradient norm, and second we\nderive an estimator of the variance reduction achieved with importance\nsampling, which enables us to switch it on when it will result in an actual\nspeedup. The resulting scheme can be used by changing a few lines of code in a\nstandard SGD procedure, and we demonstrate experimentally, on image\nclassification, CNN fine-tuning, and RNN training, that for a fixed wall-clock\ntime budget, it provides a reduction of the train losses of up to an order of\nmagnitude and a relative improvement of test errors between 5% and 17%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 16:40:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 20:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 10:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

HCN is a major constituent of the circumstellar envelopes of\ncarbon-rich evolved stars, and rotational lines from within its vibrationally\nexcited states probe parts of these regions closest to the stellar surface. A\nnumber of such lines are known to show maser action. Historically, in one of\nthem, the 177 GHz $J=2\\rightarrow1$ line in the $l$-doubled bending mode has\nbeen found to show relatively strong maser action, with results only published\nfor a single object, the archetypical high-mass loss asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) star IRC+10216. Aims. To examine how common 177 GHz HCN maser emission\nis, we conducted an exploratory survey for this line toward a select sample of\ncarbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars that are observable from the southern\nhemisphere. Methods. We used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment 12 meter\nsubmillimeter Telescope (APEX) equipped with a new receiver to simultaneously\nobserve three $J=2\\rightarrow1$ HCN rotational transitions, the $(0,1^{{1}_{\\rm\nc}},0)$ and $(0,1^{{1}_{\\rm d}},0)$ $l$-doublet components, and the line from\nthe (0,0,0) ground state. Results. The $(0,1^{{1}_{\\rm c}},0)$ maser line is\ndetected toward 11 of 13 observed sources, which all show emission in the\n(0,0,0) transition. In most of the sources, the peak intensity of the\n$(0,1^{{1}_{\\rm c}},0)$ line rivals that of the (0,0,0) line; in two sources,\nit is even stronger. Except for the object with the highest mass-loss rate,\nIRC+10216, the $(0,1^{{1}_{\\rm c}},0)$ line covers a smaller velocity range\nthan the (0,0,0) line. Conclusions.

In regions\nexhibiting perpendicular anisotropy, the power spectrum of the magnetization\nnoise, $S(\\nu)$, exhibits a remarkably robust $\\nu^{-3/2}$ power law over\nfrequencies $\\nu$ from 1~kHz to 1~MHz.

However, a major challenge in such deployment scenarios is the\ninterference caused by D2D links when sharing the same resources with cellular\nusers. In this work, we propose a channel allocation (CA) scheme together with\na set of three power control (PC) schemes to mitigate interference in a D2D\nunderlaid cellular system modeled as a random network using the mathematical\ntool of stochastic geometry. The novel aspect of the proposed CA scheme is that\nit enables D2D links to share resources with multiple cellular users as opposed\nto one as previously considered in the literature. Moreover, the accompanying\ndistributed PC schemes further manage interference during link establishment\nand maintenance. The first two PC schemes compensate for large-scale path-loss\neffects and maximize the D2D sum rate by employing distance-dependent pathloss\nparameters of the D2D link and the base station, including an error estimation\nmargin. The third scheme is an adaptive PC scheme based on a variable target\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, which limits the interference caused\nby D2D users and provides sufficient coverage probability for cellular users.\nClosed-form expressions for the coverage probability of cellular links, D2D\nlinks, and sum rate of D2D links are derived in terms of the allocated power,\ndensity of D2D links, and path-loss exponent. The impact of these key system\nparameters on network performance is analyzed and compared with previous work.\nSimulation results demonstrate an enhancement in cellular and D2D coverage\nprobabilities, and an increase in spectral and power efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 18:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

Given the absence of\nlocal excitatory connections within the thalamus, the notion of thalamic\n`relay' seemed like a reasonable description over the last several decades.\nRecent advances in experimental approaches and theory provide a broader\nperspective on the role of the thalamus in cognitively-relevant cortical\ncomputations, and suggest that only a subset of thalamic circuit motifs fit the\nrelay description.

A fundamental problem in\na DSDPS is the scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing average\nend-to-end tuple processing time. A widely-used solution is to distribute\nworkload evenly over machines in the cluster in a round-robin manner, which is\nobviously not efficient due to lack of consideration for communication delay.\nModel-based approaches do not work well either due to the high complexity of\nthe system environment. We aim to develop a novel model-free approach that can\nlearn to well control a DSDPS from its experience rather than accurate and\nmathematically solvable system models, just as a human learns a skill (such as\ncooking, driving, swimming, etc). Specifically, we, for the first time, propose\nto leverage emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enabling model-free\ncontrol in DSDPSs; and present design, implementation and evaluation of a novel\nand highly effective DRL-based control framework, which minimizes average\nend-to-end tuple processing time by jointly learning the system environment via\ncollecting very limited runtime statistics data and making decisions under the\nguidance of powerful Deep Neural Networks. To validate and evaluate the\nproposed framework, we implemented it based on a widely-used DSDPS, Apache\nStorm, and tested it with three representative applications. Extensive\nexperimental results show 1) Compared to Storm's default scheduler and the\nstate-of-the-art model-based method, the proposed framework reduces average\ntuple processing by 33.5% and 14.0% respectively on average. 2) The proposed\nframework can quickly reach a good scheduling solution during online learning,\nwhich justifies its practicability for online control in DSDPSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 19:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

Such probability densities have an astronomical\nnumber of local modes corresponding to typical pattern appearances. Related\ngroups of modes can join to form macroscopic image basins that represent\npattern concepts. Recent works use neural networks that capture high-order\nimage statistics to learn Gibbs models capable of synthesizing realistic images\nof many patterns. However, characterizing a learned probability density to\nuncover the Hopfield memories of the model, encoded by the structure of the\nlocal modes, remains an open challenge. In this work, we present novel\ncomputational experiments that map and visualize the local mode structure of\nGibbs densities. Efficient mapping requires identifying the global basins\nwithout enumerating the countless modes. Inspired by Grenander's jump-diffusion\nmethod, we propose a new MCMC tool called Attraction-Diffusion (AD) that can\ncapture the macroscopic structure of highly non-convex densities by measuring\nmetastability of local modes. AD involves altering the target density with a\nmagnetization potential penalizing distance from a known mode and running an\nMCMC sample of the altered density to measure the stability of the initial\nchain state. Using a low-dimensional generator network to facilitate\nexploration, we map image spaces with up to 12,288 dimensions (64 $\\times$ 64\npixels in RGB). Our work shows: (1) AD can efficiently map highly non-convex\nprobability densities, (2) metastable regions of pattern probability densities\ncontain coherent groups of images, and (3) the perceptibility of differences\nbetween training images influences the metastability of image basins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 21:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

A simple graph $G=(V,E)$ is word-representable if there\nexists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that letters $x$ and $y$ alternate\nin $w$ if and only if $xy$ is an edge in $E$. Thus, edges of $G$ are defined by\navoiding the consecutive pattern 11 in a word representing $G$, that is, by\navoiding $xx$ and $yy$.\n  In 2017, Jeff Remmel has introduced the notion of a $k$-$11$-representable\ngraph for a non-negative integer $k$, which generalizes the notion of a\nword-representable graph.

In this paper, a novel modular training framework of E2E ASR is\nproposed to separately train neural acoustic and language models during\ntraining stage, while still performing end-to-end inference in decoding stage.\nHere, an acoustics-to-phoneme model (A2P) and a phoneme-to-word model (P2W) are\ntrained using acoustic data and text data respectively. A phone synchronous\ndecoding (PSD) module is inserted between A2P and P2W to reduce sequence\nlengths without precision loss.

Here, the\ncapacitor was modeled, using a fractional differential equation in which the\norder of the fractional derivative is also a measure of the memory in the\ndielectric. The governing fractional differential equation was derived using\ntwo methods, namely a differential and integral approach. The former method\nutilized a hierarchical resistor-capacitor (RC) ladder model while the latter\nutilized the theory of the universal dielectric-response. The dynamical\nbehavior of the potential across the capacitor was found to be affected by this\nparameter, and, therefore, the memory of the system. Additionally, findings\nindicate that an increase in the memory parameter was associated with an\nincrease in the energy stored in the dielectric. It was found that oscillation\ndeath resulted in a higher amount of stored energy in the dielectric over time,\nas compared to behavior, which displayed relaxation oscillations or chaotic\nfluctuations. The relatively-lower stored energy resulting from the latter\ntypes of dynamical behavior appeared to be a consequence of the memory effect,\nwhere present accumulations of energy in the capacitor are affected by previous\ndecreases in the potential. Hence, in this type of scenario, the dielectric\nmaterial can be thought of as remembering the past behavior of the voltage,\nwhich leads to either a decrease, or an enhancement in the stored energy. The\nnon-ideal capacitor was also found to have a transitory nature, where it\nbehaves more like a resistor as {\\alpha} approaches 0, and conversely, more\nlike a capacitor as {\\alpha} goes to 1.

A\nfundamental underlying assumption in the reconstruction procedure is the\nprecise alignment of the data values, i.e. the relationship between the data\nvalues and the paths of the lines of integration is accurately known. In many\napplications, e.g. electron and X-ray tomography, it is necessary to establish\nthis relationship using software alignment techniques or image registration due\nto misalignment when rotating the physical specimen. Unfortunately, highly\naccurate software alignment is still a challenge to achieve in many cases, and\nimproper alignment results in severe loss in the imaging resolution. In this\narticle, we develop a new approach that considers the alignment problem through\na completely different lens, as a problem of recovering phase shifts in Fourier\ndomain {within} the reconstruction algorithm. The recovery of these phase\nshifts serves as the data alignment, which is done by calculating discrepancies\nbetween the misaligned data and the current reconstruction.
