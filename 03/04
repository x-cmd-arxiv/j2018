Despite a remarkable defect tolerance\ncompared to conventional semiconductors, perovskite thin films still show\nsubstantial microscale heterogeneity in key properties such as luminescence\nefficiency and device performance. This behavior has been attributed to spatial\nfluctuations in the population of sub-bandgap electronic states that act as\ntrap-mediated non-radiative recombination sites. However, the origin of the\nvariations, trap states and extent of the defect tolerance remains a topic of\ndebate, and a precise understanding is critical to the rational design of\ndefect management strategies. By combining scanning X-ray diffraction beamlines\nat two different synchrotrons with high-resolution transmission electron\nmicroscopy, we reveal levels of heterogeneity on the ten-micrometer scale\n(super-grains) and even ten-nanometer scale (sub-grain domains). We find that\nlocal strain is associated with enhanced defect concentrations, and\ncorrelations between the local structure and time-resolved photoluminescence\nreveal that these strain-related defects are the cause of non-radiative\nrecombination. We reveal a direct connection between defect concentrations and\nnon-radiative losses, as well as complex heterogeneity across multiple length\nscales, shedding new light on the presence and influence of structural defects\nin halide perovskites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Mar 2018 16:05:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 07:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

The distribution of escape times however not only shows a\nclear sign of stochastic resonance, but changing the direction of the forcing\nfrom alternating to synchronised saddles an additional resonance at double the\nforcing frequency starts to appear. The conditional KS test reliably detects\nthe stochastic resonance even for forcing quick enough and for data so sparse\nthat the stochastic resonance is not obvious directly from the histogram of\nescape times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Mar 2018 17:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

From\nextensive numerical simulations, we show that for $L_0 \\gg 1$ there exists a\ntransient regime in which the statistics is consistent with that of flat KPZ\nsystems (the $\\omega=0$ case), for both $\\omega<0$ and $\\omega>0$.

Our haloscope consists of an array\nof small microwave cavities connected by rectangular irises, in an arrangement\ncommonly used in radio-frequency filters. The size of the unit cavity\ndetermines the main resonant frequency, while the possibility to connect a\n{large} number of cavities allows to reach large detection volumes. We develop\nthe theoretical framework of the detection concept, and present design\nprescriptions to optimize detection capabilities.

With the ease of\navailability of check-in data, the location-based social networks (LBSN) (e.g.,\nFacebook1, etc.) have been heavily explored in the past decade for\nPoint-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. Though many POI recommenders have been\ndefined, most of them have focused on recommending a single location or an\narbitrary list that is not contextually coherent. It has been cumbersome to\nrely on such systems when one needs a contextually coherent list of locations,\nthat can be used for various day-to-day activities, for e.g., itinerary\nplanning. This paper proposes a model termed as CAPS (Context-Aware\nPersonalized POI Sequence Recommender System) that generates contextually\ncoherent POI sequences relevant to user preferences. To the best of our\nknowledge, CAPS is the first attempt to formulate the contextual POI sequence\nmodeling by extending Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variants. CAPS\nextends RNN by incorporating multiple contexts to the hidden layer and by\nincorporating global context (sequence features) to the hidden layers and the\noutput layer. It extends the variants of RNN (e.g., Long-short term memory\n(LSTM)) by incorporating multiple contexts and global features in the gate\nupdate relations. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) it models the\ncontextual POI sequence problem by incorporating personalized user preferences\nthrough multiple constraints (e.g., categorical, social, temporal, etc.), (ii)\nit extends RNN to incorporate the contexts of individual item and that of the\nwhole sequence. It also extends the gated functionality of variants of RNN to\nincorporate the multiple contexts, and (iii) it evaluates the proposed models\nagainst two real-world data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Mar 2018 21:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi\ncompanies in pre-allocating taxis. The key challenge of traffic prediction lies\nin how to model the complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics.\nAlthough both factors have been considered in modeling, existing works make\nstrong assumptions about spatial dependence and temporal dynamics, i.e.,\nspatial dependence is stationary in time, and temporal dynamics is strictly\nperiodical. However, in practice, the spatial dependence could be dynamic\n(i.e., changing from time to time), and the temporal dynamics could have some\nperturbation from one period to another period. In this paper, we make two\nimportant observations: (1) the spatial dependencies between locations are\ndynamic; and (2) the temporal dependency follows daily and weekly pattern but\nit is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. To address these\ntwo issues, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network (STDN), in\nwhich a flow gating mechanism is introduced to learn the dynamic similarity\nbetween locations, and a periodically shifted attention mechanism is designed\nto handle long-term periodic temporal shifting.

We demonstrate the real-time\nperformance of our prototype as well as the classification performance using a\ndataset that we collect and analyze from scratch (including new findings in\nterms of leaks and patterns).

In 2012, Press and Dyson developed a method\nfor analyzing the mapping of the 8-dimensional strategy profile onto the\n2-dimensional payoff space in an infinitely iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game,\nbased on Markov chain analysis and memory-one strategies. We generalize this\napproach and introduce the concept of strategy parameter to show that linear\nrelations among player payoffs are a ubiquitous feature of the infinitely\niterated Prisoner's Dilemma game.

Strategy profiles are identified that map onto the\nvertices, edges, and interior of the Prisoner's Dilemma quadrilateral in the\n2-dimensional payoff (score) space. A DaMD strategy is defined based solely on\n\"Defection after Mutual Defection\" and leads to linear relations between player\nscores using strategy parameter analysis.

We use a modified Kane-Mele model to\nillustrate the magnetic spin Hall effect, and to discuss its bulk-boundary\nrelationship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 04:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 21:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

Bacterial motility\ndetermines the spatio-temporal structure of microbial communities, controls\ninfection spreading and the microbiota organization in guts or in soils. Most\ntheoretical approaches for modeling bacterial transport rely on their\nrun-and-tumble motion. For Escherichia coli, the run time distribution was\nreported to follow a Poisson process with a single characteristic time related\nto the rotational switching of the flagellar motors. However, direct\nmeasurements on flagellar motors show heavy-tailed distributions of rotation\ntimes stemming from the intrinsic noise in the chemotactic mechanism.\nCurrently, there is no direct experimental evidence that the stochasticity in\nthe chemotactic machinery affect the macroscopic motility of bacteria. In stark\ncontrast with the accepted vision of run-and-tumble, here we report a large\nbehavioral variability of wild-type \\emph{E. coli}, revealed in their\nthree-dimensional trajectories. At short observation times, a large\ndistribution of run times is measured on a population and attributed to the\nslow fluctuations of a signaling protein triggering the flagellar motor\nreversal. Over long times, individual bacteria undergo significant changes in\nmotility. We demonstrate that such a large distribution of run times introduces\nmeasurement biases in most practical situations. Our results reconcile the\nnotorious conundrum between run time observations and motor switching\nstatistics. We finally propose that statistical modeling of transport\nproperties currently undertaken in the emerging framework of active matter\nstudies, should be reconsidered under the scope of this large variability of\nmotility features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 04:07:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 22:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

At its core, SCOUT extracts search\nhints (inference of resource requirements) from low-level performance metrics.\nSuch hints enable SCOUT to navigate through the search space more\nefficiently---only spotlight region will be searched.\n  We evaluate SCOUT with 107 workloads on Apache Hadoop and Spark.

Most analyses of\niteration complexity focus on the special case of proximal gradient method, or\naccelerated variants thereof. There have been only a few studies of methods\nthat use a second-order approximation to the smooth part, due in part to the\ndifficulty of obtaining closed-form solutions to the subproblems at each\niteration. In fact, iterative algorithms may need to be used to find inexact\nsolutions to these subproblems. In this work, we present global analysis of the\niteration complexity of inexact successive quadratic approximation methods,\nshowing that an inexact solution of the subproblem that is within a fixed\nmultiplicative precision of optimality suffices to guarantee the same order of\nconvergence rate as the exact version, with complexity related in an intuitive\nway to the measure of inexactness.

The two-dimensional (2D) potential of\nmean force (PMF) is presented using combinations of intermolecular distance and\nangle between two water molecules. The saddle point of the 2D PMF suggests the\npresence of the transition state that distinguishes between H-bond and non\nH-bond states.

We use comparison arguments with other, less natural but simpler to\nanalyze, Markov chains, to show that the switch chain mixes rapidly in two\ndifferent settings. We first study the classic problem of uniformly sampling\nsimple undirected, as well as bipartite, graphs with a given degree sequence.\nWe apply an embedding argument, involving a Markov chain defined by Jerrum and\nSinclair (TCS, 1990) for sampling graphs that almost have a given degree\nsequence, to show rapid mixing for degree sequences satisfying strong\nstability, a notion closely related to $P$-stability. This results in a much\nshorter proof that unifies the currently known rapid mixing results of the\nswitch chain and extends them up to sharp characterizations of $P$-stability.\nIn particular, our work resolves an open problem posed by Greenhill (SODA,\n2015).\n  Secondly, in order to illustrate the power of our approach, we study the\nproblem of uniformly sampling graphs for which, in addition to the degree\nsequence, a joint degree distribution is given. Although the problem was\nformalized over a decade ago, and despite its practical significance in\ngenerating synthetic network topologies, small progress has been made on the\nrandom sampling of such graphs. The case of a single degree class reduces to\nsampling of regular graphs, but beyond this almost nothing is known. We fully\nresolve the case of two degree classes, by showing that the switch Markov chain\nis always rapidly mixing.

Currently, state-of-the-art DNN regularization techniques consist in\nrandomly dropping units and/or connections on each iteration of the training\nalgorithm. Dropout and DropConnect are characteristic examples of such\nregularizers, that are widely popular among practitioners. However, a drawback\nof such approaches consists in the fact that their postulated probability of\nrandom unit/connection omission is a constant that must be heuristically\nselected based on the obtained performance in some validation set. To alleviate\nthis burden, in this paper we regard the DNN regularization problem from a\nBayesian inference perspective: We impose a sparsity-inducing prior over the\nnetwork synaptic weights, where the sparsity is induced by a set of\nBernoulli-distributed binary variables with Beta (hyper-)priors over their\nprior parameters. This way, we eventually allow for marginalizing over the DNN\nsynaptic connectivity for output generation, thus giving rise to an effective,\nheuristics-free, network regularization scheme. We perform Bayesian inference\nfor the resulting hierarchical model by means of an efficient Black-Box\nVariational inference scheme. We exhibit the advantages of our method over\nexisting approaches by conducting an extensive experimental evaluation using\nbenchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 12:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

These oscillations emerge once the\ncolony reaches a large enough number of cells. However, it remains unclear\nwhether the amplitude of the oscillations, and thus their effectiveness, builds\nup over time gradually, or if they can emerge instantly with a non-zero\namplitude. Here we address this question by combining microfluidics-based\ntime-lapse microscopy experiments with a minimal theoretical description of the\nsystem in the form of a delay-differential equation model. Analytical and\nnumerical methods reveal that oscillations arise through a subcritical Hopf\nbifurcation, which enables instant high amplitude oscillations. Consequently,\nthe model predicts a bistable regime where an oscillating and a non-oscillating\nattractor coexist in phase space. We experimentally validate this prediction by\nshowing that oscillations can be triggered by perturbing the media conditions,\nprovided the biofilm size lies within an appropriate range. The model also\npredicts that the minimum size at which oscillations start decreases with\nstress, a fact that we also verify experimentally. Taken together, our results\nshow that collective oscillations in cell populations can emerge suddenly with\nnon-zero amplitude via a discontinuous transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 12:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

Both these approaches are untenable for\npolyatomic ions. Here rotational and translational dynamics are so strongly\ncoupled that one obtains a more coherent description by treating them together.\nWe carry out theoretical and computational studies of a series of well-known\npolyatomic ions, namely sulfate, nitrate and acetate ions.
