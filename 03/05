The propagation of the wave field is governed by the 3D\nHelmholtz equation. Our method consists of two stages. On the first stage, we\nuse asymptotic analysis to obtain an upper estimate for the modulus of the\nscattered wave field. This estimate allows us to approximately reconstruct the\nwave field at the measurement board using an inversion formula. This reduces\nthe phaseless inverse scattering problem to the phased one. At the second\nstage, we apply a recently developed globally convergent numerical method to\nreconstruct the desired refractive index from the total wave obtained at the\nfirst stage.

A\nsignificant outcome of this study is that the nano-sized fraction represents\n26% by mass of the initial BWP. Human bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3) are\nused as relevant target cells to investigate their cytotoxicity. We observe a\nclear short-term loss of viability associated to reactive oxygen species\ngeneration, but with limited pro-inflammatory effects. On an actual\ncell-deposited mass-dose basis, the cytotoxicity of the nanosized fraction is\nsimilar to that of BWP, suggesting that the cytotoxicity is particle size\nindependent. To conclude, brake wear dust contains substantial amount of\nmetallic nanoparticles exhibiting toxicity for lung cells, and should warrant\nfurther consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 21:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we study the three feedback effects (the stellar wind heating, SNe\nfeedback, and AGN feedback) in suppressing star formation activities on the\nevolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses. AGN feedback\nmodels are updated based on \\citet{Yuan2018}. The gas sources comes exclusively\nfrom the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models. We find\nthat SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low\nmass elliptical galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass\ngalaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently offset the radiative cooling and thus\nregulate the star formation activities. Such a suppression of star formation is\nextremely efficient in the inner region of the galaxies. AGB heating cannot\naccount for this suppression for low and high mass galaxies. The X-ray\ntemperature $T_{\\rm X}$ and luminosity $L_{\\rm X}$ of hot plasma can be in\nagreement with the observed data with the inclusion of effective feedback\nprocesses.

Recent\nwork has shown that modern mixed integer optimization (MIO) solvers can be used\nto address small to moderate instances of this problem. In spite of the\nusefulness of $L_0$-based estimators and generic MIO solvers, there is a steep\ncomputational price to pay when compared to popular sparse learning algorithms\n(e.g., based on $L_1$ regularization). In this paper, we aim to push the\nfrontiers of computation for a family of $L_0$-regularized problems with\nadditional convex penalties. We propose a new hierarchy of necessary optimality\nconditions for these problems. We develop fast algorithms, based on coordinate\ndescent and local combinatorial optimization, that are guaranteed to converge\nto solutions satisfying these optimality conditions. From a statistical\nviewpoint, an interesting story emerges. When the signal strength is high, our\ncombinatorial optimization algorithms have an edge in challenging statistical\nsettings. When the signal is lower, pure $L_0$ benefits from additional convex\nregularization.

We focus on the scenario where the the channel between the\nsource and the destination is noisy, and each transmitted update may fail\nindependently with a constant probability. We assume there is no channel state\ninformation or transmission feedback available to the sensor. We prove that\nwithin a broadly defined class of online policies, the best-effort uniform\nupdating policy, which was shown to be optimal when the channel is perfect, is\nstill optimal in the presence of update failures. Our proof relies on tools\nfrom Martingale processes, and the construction of a sequence of virtual\npolicies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 02:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 15:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-12"}

In this case, the\ncardinality of a stable matching can be as small as half the size of a maximum\nmatching. Popular matchings allow for assignments of larger size while still\nguaranteeing a certain fairness condition. In fact, stable matchings are\npopular matchings of minimum size, and a maximum size popular matching can be\nas large as twice the size of a(ny) stable matching in a given instance. The\nstructure of popular matchings seems to be more complex, and currently less\nunderstood, than that of stable matchings.

First, we give a granular\nanalysis of the complexity of popular matching with forbidden and forced\nelements problems, thus complementing results from [Cseh and Kavitha, 2016]. In\nparticular, we show that deciding whether there exists a popular matching with\n(or without) two given edges is NP-Hard. This implies that finding a popular\nmatching of maximum (resp. minimum) weight is NP-Hard and, even if all weights\nare nonnegative, inapproximable up to a factor 1/2 (resp. up to any factor).

Predictive state\npolicy networks consist of a recursive filter, which keeps track of a belief\nabout the state of the environment, and a reactive policy that directly maps\nbeliefs to actions, to maximize the cumulative reward. The recursive filter\nleverages predictive state representations (PSRs) (Rosencrantz and Gordon,\n2004; Sun et al., 2016) by modeling predictive state-- a prediction of the\ndistribution of future observations conditioned on history and future actions.\nThis representation gives rise to a rich class of statistically consistent\nalgorithms (Hefny et al., 2018) to initialize the recursive filter. Predictive\nstate serves as an equivalent representation of a belief state. Therefore, the\npolicy component of the RPSP-network can be purely reactive, simplifying\ntraining while still allowing optimal behaviour. Moreover, we use the PSR\ninterpretation during training as well, by incorporating prediction error in\nthe loss function. The entire network (recursive filter and reactive policy) is\nstill differentiable and can be trained using gradient based methods. We\noptimize our policy using a combination of policy gradient based on rewards\n(Williams, 1992) and gradient descent based on prediction error. We show the\nefficacy of RPSP-networks under partial observability on a set of robotic\ncontrol tasks from OpenAI Gym.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of tracking top-$k$ influential\nvertices in dynamic networks, where the dynamic changes are modeled as a stream\nof edge weight updates. Under the popularly adopted linear threshold (LT) model\nand the independent cascade (IC) model, we address two essential versions of\nthe problem: tracking the top-$k$ influential individuals and finding the best\n$k$-seed set to maximize the influence spread (Influence Maximization). We\nadopt the polling-based method and maintain a sample of random RR sets so that\nwe can approximate the influence of vertices with provable quality guarantees.\nIt is known that updating RR sets over dynamic changes of a network can be\neasily done by a reservoir sampling method, so the key challenge is to\nefficiently decide how many RR sets are needed to achieve good quality\nguarantees.

For both tasks the error incurred in our method is only a\nmultiplicative factor to the ground truth. For influence maximization, we also\npropose an efficient query algorithm for finding the $k$ seeds, which is one\norder of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art query algorithm in\npractice. In addition to the thorough theoretical results, our experimental\nresults on large real networks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 05:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

First, since GANs use only a continuous latent\ndistribution to embed multiple classes or clusters of data, they often do not\ncorrectly handle the structural discontinuity between disparate classes in a\nlatent space. Second, discriminators of GANs easily forget about past generated\nsamples by generators, incurring instability during adversarial training. We\nargue that these two infamous problems of unsupervised GAN training can be\nlargely alleviated by a learnable memory network to which both generators and\ndiscriminators can access. Generators can effectively learn representation of\ntraining samples to understand underlying cluster distributions of data, which\nease the structure discontinuity problem. At the same time, discriminators can\nbetter memorize clusters of previously generated samples, which mitigate the\nforgetting problem. We propose a novel end-to-end GAN model named memoryGAN,\nwhich involves a memory network that is unsupervisedly trainable and integrable\nto many existing GAN models. With evaluations on multiple datasets such as\nFashion-MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR10, and Chairs, we show that our model is\nprobabilistically interpretable, and generates realistic image samples of high\nvisual fidelity.

Many problems in vision are treated as assigning each pixel a label.\nDisparities are labels for stereo. Such pixel-labeling problems are naturally\nrepresented in terms of energy minimization, where the energy function has two\nterms: one term penalizes solutions that inconsistent with the observed data,\nthe other term enforces spatial smoothness. Graph cuts are one of the effi-\ncient methods for solving energy minimization. However, exact minimization of\nmulti labeling problems can be performed by graph cuts only for the case with\nconvex smoothness terms. In pixel-disparity formulation, convex smoothness\nterms do not generate well reconstructed 3D results. Thus, truncated linear or\nquadratic smoothness terms, etc. are used, where approximate energy\nminimization is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a new site-labeling\nformulation, where the sites are not pixels but lines in 3D space, labels are\nnot disparities but depth numbers. For this formulation, visibility reasoning\nis naturally included in the energy function. In addition, this formulation\nallows us to use a small smoothness term, which does not affect the 3D results\nmuch. This makes the optimization step very simple, so we could develop an\napproximation method for graph cut itself (not for energy minimization) and a\nhigh performance GPU graph cut program. For Tsukuba stereo pair in Middlebury\ndata set, we got the result in 5ms using GTX1080GPU, 19ms using GTX660GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 06:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

The\nseminal work of Ben-Or et al. (STOC 1988) shows that zero knowledge can be\nachieved unconditionally for any language in NEXP, as long as one is willing to\nmake a suitable physical assumption: if the provers are spatially isolated,\nthen they can be assumed to be playing independent strategies. Quantum\nmechanics, however, tells us that this assumption is unrealistic, because\nspatially-isolated provers could share a quantum entangled state and realize a\nnon-local correlated strategy. The MIP* model captures this setting. In this\nwork we study the following question: does spatial isolation still suffice to\nunconditionally achieve zero knowledge even in the presence of quantum\nentanglement? We answer this question in the affirmative: we prove that every\nlanguage in NEXP has a 2-prover zero knowledge interactive proof that is sound\nagainst entangled provers; that is, NEXP \\subseteq ZK-MIP*. Our proof consists\nof constructing a zero knowledge interactive PCP with a strong algebraic\nstructure, and then lifting it to the MIP* model. This lifting relies on a new\nframework that builds on recent advances in low-degree testing against\nentangled strategies, and clearly separates classical and quantum tools. Our\nmain technical contribution consists of developing new algebraic techniques for\nobtaining unconditional zero knowledge; this includes a zero knowledge variant\nof the celebrated sumcheck protocol, a key building block in many probabilistic\nproof systems. A core component of our sumcheck protocol is a new algebraic\ncommitment scheme, whose analysis relies on algebraic complexity theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 07:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-12"}

Many algorithms are known to achieve the minimax optimal order\nof $O(\\sqrt{T \\log n})$ in expectation for both regret and number of switches,\nwhere $T$ is the number of iterations and $n$ the number of actions. However,\nno high probability (h.p.) guarantees are known. Our main technical\ncontribution is the first algorithms which with h.p. achieve this optimal order\nfor both regret and switches. This settles an open problem of [Devroye et al.,\n2015], and directly implies the first h.p. guarantees for several problems of\ninterest.\n  Next, to investigate the value of switching actions at a more granular level,\nwe introduce the setting of switching budgets, in which algorithms are limited\nto $S \\leq T$ switches between actions. This entails a limited number of free\nswitches, in contrast to the unlimited number of expensive switches in the\nswitching cost setting.

The\naxiomatization of the greatest fixed-point is simple. The axiomatization of the\nleast fixed- point is more complex, in particular every monotone formula\nconverges to its least fixed-point by Kleene's iteration in a finite number of\nsteps, but there is no uniform upper bound on the number of iterations. We\nextract, out of the algorithm, upper bounds for such n, depending on the size\nof the formula. For some formulas, we show that these upper bounds are\npolynomial and optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 08:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

This view\nmotivates a robust optimization framework and equivalence to a corresponding\nregularized objective.\n  Under the proposed robustness framework, we demonstrate efficacy of Hamming\nloss for tail-label detection in extreme classification. The equivalent\nregularized objective, in combination with proximal gradient based\noptimization, performs better than state-of-the-art methods on propensity\nscored versions of precision@k and nDCG@k(upto 20% relative improvement over\nPFastreXML - a leading tree-based approach and 60% relative improvement over\nSLEEC - a leading label-embedding approach).

The optical data\ncollected with the SOAR telescope allowed us to identify the donor star in this\nsystem as a late M giant at a distance of 2.7$^{+3.4}_{-1.2}$ kpc. The data\ncollected quasi-simultaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR showed the presence\nof a modulation with a period of 6680$\\pm$3 s in the X-ray light curves of the\nsource. This unveils that the compact object hosted in this system is a slowly\nrotating neutron star. The broadband X-ray spectrum showed the presence of a\nstrong absorption ($\\gg$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) and prominent emission lines at\n6.4 keV, and 7.1 keV. These features are usually found in wind-fed systems, in\nwhich the emission lines result from the fluorescence of the X-rays from the\naccreting compact object on the surrounding stellar wind. The presence of a\nstrong absorption line around $\\sim$21 keV in the NuSTAR spectrum suggests a\ncyclotron origin, thus allowing us to estimate the neutron star magnetic field\nas $\\sim$2.4$\\times$10$^{12}$ G.

Traditional CF models mainly focus on predicting a user's preference\nto the items in a single domain such as the movie domain or the music domain. A\nmajor challenge for such models is the data sparsity problem, and especially,\nCF cannot make accurate predictions for the cold-start users who have no\nratings at all. Although Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (CDCF) is\nproposed for effectively transferring users' rating preference across different\ndomains, it is still difficult for existing CDCF models to tackle the\ncold-start users in the target domain due to the extreme data sparsity. In this\npaper, we propose a Cross-Domain Latent Feature Mapping (CDLFM) model for\ncold-start users in the target domain. Firstly, in order to better characterize\nusers in sparse domains, we take the users' similarity relationship on rating\nbehaviors into consideration and propose the Matrix Factorization by\nincorporating User Similarities (MFUS) in which three similarity measures are\nproposed. Next, to perform knowledge transfer across domains, we propose a\nneighborhood based gradient boosting trees method to learn the cross-domain\nuser latent feature mapping function. For each cold-start user, we learn\nhis/her feature mapping function based on the latent feature pairs of those\nlinked users who have similar rating behaviors with the cold-start user in the\nauxiliary domain. And the preference of the cold-start user in the target\ndomain can be predicted based on the mapping function and his/her latent\nfeatures in the auxiliary domain. Experimental results on two real data sets\nextracted from Amazon transaction data demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed model against other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 11:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

We establish the parameters that must be considered to determine\nthe optimal search: the impedance match to dark matter; receiver\nfrequency-response and tuning; irreducible noise sources; and prior information\non the dark-matter signal. Using complex-power flow equations, we identify two\ncategories of coupling to the dark-matter signal: radiative and reactive.

But as\nexperimental data never reach that limit, numerous methods for making the\nextraction have been proposed, though often the functions are determined after\nseeing the data which can lead to confirmation bias. To find functional forms\nthat will allow for a robust extraction of the input radius for a wide variety\nof functional forms in order to have confidence in the extraction from upcoming\nlow $Q^2$ experimental data such as the Jefferson Lab PRad experiment, we\ncreate a general framework for inputting form-factor functions as well as\nvarious fitting functions. The input form factors are used to generate\npseudo-data with fluctuations intended to mimic the binning and random\nuncertainty of a given set of real data. All combinations of input functions\nand fit functions can then be tested repeatedly against regenerated\npseudo-data. Since the input radius is known, this allows us to find fit\nfunctions that are robust for radius extractions in an objective fashion. For\nthe range and uncertainty of the PRad data, we find that a two-parameter\nrational function, a two-parameter continued fraction and the second order\npolynomial expansion of $z$ can extract the input radius regardless of the\ninput charge form factor function that is used. We have created an easily\nexpandable framework to search for functional forms that allow for a robust\nextraction of the radius from a given binning and uncertainty of pseudo-data\ngenerated from a wide variety of trial functions.

Many of these simulations use moment-based methods\nto track radiative transfer processes using explicit solvers and are therefore\nsubject to strict stability conditions regarding the speed of light, which\nimplies a great computational cost. It can be reduced by assuming a reduced\nspeed of light, and this approximation is now widely used to produce\nlarge-scale simulations of reionization. We introduce a new method for\nestimating and comparing the ionization front speeds based on maps of the\nreionization redshifts. We applied it to a set of cosmological simulations of\nthe reionization using a set of reduced speeds of light, and measured the\nevolution of the ionization front speeds during the reionization process. We\nfind that ionization fronts progress via a two-stage process, the first stage\nat low velocity as the fronts emerge from high density regions and a second\nlater stage just before the overlap, during which front speeds increase close\nto the speed of light. Using a set of small 8Mpc/h^3 simulations, we find that\na minimal velocity of 0.3c is able to model these two stages in this specific\ncontext without significant impact. Values as low as 0.05c can model the first\nlow velocity stage, but limit the acceleration at later times. Lower values\nmodify the distribution of front speeds at all times. Using larger 64Mpc/h^3\nvolumes that better account for distant sources, we find that reduced speed of\nlight has a greater impact on reionization times and front speeds in underdense\nregions that are reionized at late times.

At population sizes typically found in currently available\ndatasets for species-rich plant communities we find only a very low power to\ndetect interactions.

A number of different modalities, such as speech or\nfacial expression, individually and with eye gaze, have been investigated by\nthe affective computing research community to either classify the emotion (e.g.\nsad, happy, angry) or predict the continuous values of affective dimensions\n(e.g. valence, arousal, dominance) at each moment in time. Surprisingly after\nan extensive literature review, eye gaze as a unimodal input to a continuous\naffect prediction system has not been considered. In this context, this paper\nevaluates the use of eye gaze as a unimodal input to a continuous affect\nprediction system.

In recent\ntimes, more attention has been given to continuous affect prediction across\ndimensions in the emotional space, e.g. arousal and valence. Continuous affect\nprediction is the task of predicting a numerical value for different emotion\ndimensions. The application of continuous affect prediction is powerful in\ndomains involving real-time audio-visual communications which could include\nremote or assistive technologies for psychological assessment of subjects.\nModalities used for continuous affect prediction may include speech, facial\nexpressions and physiological responses. As opposed to single modality\nanalysis, the research community have combined multiple modalities to improve\nthe accuracy of continuous affect prediction. In this context, this paper\ninvestigates a continuous affect prediction system using the novel combination\nof speech and eye gaze. A new eye gaze feature set is proposed. This novel\napproach uses open source software for real-time affect prediction in\naudio-visual communication environments. A unique advantage of the\nhuman-computer interface used here is that it does not require the subject to\nwear specialized and expensive eye-tracking headsets or intrusive devices.

Rigidity is therefore valid only\nin the {\\em metastable} state that emerges because these particle\nrearrangements in response to a deformation, or strain, are associated with\nslow collective processes. Here, we show that a thermodynamic collective\nvariable may be used to quantify particle rearrangements that occur as a solid\nis deformed at zero strain rate. Advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques are\nthen employed to obtain the equilibrium free energy as a function of this\nvariable. Our results lead to a new view on rigidity: While at zero strain a\nrigid crystal coexists with one that responds to infinitesimal strain by\nrearranging particles and expelling stress, at finite strain the rigid crystal\nis metastable, associated with a free energy barrier that decreases with\nincreasing strain. The rigid phase becomes thermodynamically stable by\nswitching on an external field, which penalises particle rearrangements. This\nproduces a line of first-order phase transitions in the field - strain plane\nthat intersects the origin. Failure of a solid once strained beyond its elastic\nlimit is associated with kinetic decay processes of the metastable rigid\ncrystal deformed with a finite strain rate.

We study the resulting\nlow-temperature low-symmetry crystal structure by synchrotron x-ray\ndiffraction. The consistent features of x-ray low-temperature patterns are\nexplained by the tetragonal model of Ehrenberg et. al (Pow. Diff. 17, 230(\n2002)), while other features depend on sample or cooling protocol. Complex\npartially ordered magnetic state is studied by neutron diffraction and\nspherical neutron polarimetry. Multiple magnetic domains of configuration arms\nof the propagation vectors k1=(1/2 1/2 0), k2=(1 0 1/2) appear. The ordered\nmoment reaches 1.94(3) muB/Cr3+ for k1 and 2.08(3) muB/Cr3+ for k2, if equal\namount of the k1 and k2 phases is assumed. The magnetic arrangements have the\ndominant components along the [110] and [1-10] diagonals and a smaller\nc-component. By inelastic neutron scattering we investigate the spin\nexcitations, which comprise a mixture of dispersive spin waves propagating from\nthe magnetic Bragg peaks and resonance modes centered at equal energy steps of\n4.5 meV. We interpret these as acoustic and optical spin wave branches, but\nshow that the neutron scattering cross sections of transitions within a unit of\ntwo corner-sharing tetrahedra match the observed intensity distribution of the\nresonances. The distinctive fingerprint of cluster-like excitations in the\noptical spin wave branches suggests that propagating excitations are localized\nby the complex crystal structure and magnetic orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 15:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Recent studies have focussed on also explaining the observed\npolarization profiles, that show even more dramatic variations during the\npassage of these shock fronts. While most of these variations can be explained\nwith an almost constant magnetic field as a function of time, several studies\nhave reported changes in the inferred magnetic field strength during UF phases.\nIn this study we investigate the origin of these periodic variations of the\nmagnetic field strength by analyzing a time-series of high temporal cadence\nobservations acquired in the Ca II line with the CRISP instrument at the\nSwedish 1-m Solar Telescope. In particular, we analyze how the inferred\ngeometrical height scale changes between quiescent and UF phases, and whether\nthose changes are enough to explain the observed changes in $B$. We have\nperformed non-LTE data inversions with the NICOLE code of a time-series of very\nhigh spatio-temporal resolution observations in the Ca II and Fe I\n630.15\\630.25 nm lines. Our results indicate that the Ca II line in sunspots is\ngreatly sensitive to magnetic fields at $\\log\\tau_{500}=-5$ during UFs and\nquiescence. However, this optical depth value does not correspond to the same\ngeometrical height during the two phases. Our results indicate that during UFs\nand RPWs the $\\log\\tau=-5$ is located at a higher geometrical height than\nduring quiescence. Additionally, the inferred magnetic field values are higher\nin UFs (~270 G) and in RPWs (~100 G). Our results suggest that opacity changes\ncaused by UFs and RPWs cannot explain the observed temporal variations in the\nmagnetic field, as the line seems to form at higher geometrical heights where\nthe field is expected to be lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 15:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 13:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Most existing variations of NMF only\nconsider how each row/column vector of factorised matrices should be shaped,\nand ignore the relationship among pairwise rows or columns. In many cases, such\npairwise relationship enables better factorisation, for example, image\nclustering and recommender systems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm\nnamed, Relative Pairwise Relationship constrained Non-negative Matrix\nFactorisation (RPR-NMF), which places constraints over relative pairwise\ndistances amongst features by imposing penalties in a triplet form. Two\ndistance measures, squared Euclidean distance and Symmetric divergence, are\nused, and exponential and hinge loss penalties are adopted for the two measures\nrespectively. It is well known that the so-called \"multiplicative update rules\"\nresult in a much faster convergence than gradient descend for matrix\nfactorisation. However, applying such update rules to RPR-NMF and also proving\nits convergence is not straightforward. Thus, we use reasonable approximations\nto relax the complexity brought by the penalties, which are practically\nverified. Experiments on both synthetic datasets and real datasets demonstrate\nthat our algorithms have advantages on gaining close approximation, satisfying\na high proportion of expected constraints, and achieving superior performance\ncompared with other algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 07:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Four switching time measurements were\nexperimentally obtained, and the transistors also had their Early parameters\n$V_a$ (the Early voltage) and $s$ (a proportionality constant such that $R_o =\n1/tan(s I_B)$ accurately estimated by using an experimental-numeric procedure\nthat involves Hough transform accumulation in order to identify the crossing of\nthe base current ($I_B$) indexed characteristic isolines, yielding the\nrespective $V_a$.

It has been shown, that in the\nproposed algorithm, there is no problem in comparing with a widely used method\n- the impulse method, as the proposed algorithm always gives a result\nregardless of whether impulse process, which corresponds to the weighted\ndirected graph, is a stable or not. Also the result of calculation according to\nthe proposed algorithm does not depend on the initial impulse, and vice versa\nthe initial values of the weights of the vertices influence on the result of\ncalculation. Unlike the impulse method, the proposed algorithm for calculating\na mutual influence of the vertices does not violate the scale invariance after\nincreasing the elements of the adjacent matrix, which corresponds to the\ncognitive map, in the same value. Also in this article the advantages of the\nproposed algorithm on numerous examples of analysis of cognitive maps are\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 15:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}
