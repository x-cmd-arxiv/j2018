Using humid air as the working\nfluid in the thermoacoustic refrigerator is one of the research focus to\nimprove the thermoacoustic performance, but the corresponding effect is the\ncondensation of humid air in the thermal stack. Due to the small sized spacing\nof thermal stack and the need to explore the detailed condensation process in\noscillating flow, a mesoscale numerical approach need to be developed. Over the\ndecades, several types of Lattice Boltzmann (LB) models for multiphase flows\nhave been developed under different physical pictures, for example the\ncolor-gradient model, the Shan-Chen model, the nonideal pressure tensor model\nand the HSD model. In the current study, a pseudopotential\nMultiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) LBM simulation was utilized to simulate the\nincompressible oscillating flow and condensation in parallel plates. In the\ninitial stage of condensation, the oscillating flow benefits to accumulate the\nsaturated vapor at the exit regions, and the velocity vector of saturated vapor\nclearly showed the flow over the droplets. It was also concluded that if the\ncondensate can be removed out from the parallel plates, the oscillating flow\nand condensation will continuously feed the cold surface to form more water\ndroplets. The effect of wettability to the condensation was discussed, and it\nturned out that by increasing the wettability, the saturated water vapor was\neasier to condense on the cold walls, and the distance between each pair of\ndroplets was also strongly affected by the wettability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 16:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

In particular, the variation of fission product yields\nwith neutron energy has been considered as a possible source of the\ndiscrepancies between antineutrino observations and models. In simulations of\nlow-enriched and highly-enriched reactor core designs, we find a substantial\nfraction of fissions (from 5% to more than 40%) are caused by non-thermal\nneutrons. Using tabulated evaluations of nuclear fission and decay, we estimate\nthe variation in antineutrino emission by the prominent fission parents U-235,\nPu-239, and Pu-241 versus neutron energy. The differences in fission neutron\nenergy are found to produce less than 1% variation in detected antineutrino\nrate per fission of U-235, Pu-239, and Pu-241. Corresponding variations in the\nantineutrino spectrum are found to be less than 10% below 7 MeV antineutrino\nenergy, smaller than current model uncertainties. We conclude that insufficient\nmodeling of fission neutron energy is unlikely to be the cause of the various\nreactor anomalies.

The CF\nis constrained by centrality selection based on particle multiplicity in a\nreference subevent, and contributes to observables measured in another\nsubevent. Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the\ninfluence of CF on several distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities\n$\\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\\epsilon_n)$, $p(\\epsilon_n,\\epsilon_m)$ and\n$p(N,\\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using multi-particle\ncumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation\nis established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the\nreference subevent. In ultra-central collisions, where distribution of particle\nproduction sources is strongly distorted, we find these cumulants exhibit rich\nsign-change patterns, due to observable-dependent non-Gaussianity in the\nunderlying distributions. The details of sign-change pattern change with the\nsize of the collision systems. Simultaneous comparison of these different types\ncumulants between model prediction and experimental data can be used to\nconstrain the CF and particle production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.\nSince the concept of centrality and CF are expected to fluctuate in the\nlongitudinal direction within a single event, we propose to use\npseudorapidity-separated subevent cumulant method to explore the nature of\nintra-event fluctuations of centrality and collective dynamics.

While fault-tolerance requires relatively mild assumptions\nabout the nature of qubit errors, the overhead associated with coherent and\nnon-Markovian errors can be orders of magnitude larger than the overhead\nassociated with purely stochastic Markovian errors. One proposal to address\nthis challenge is to randomize the circuits of interest, shaping the errors to\nbe stochastic Pauli errors but leaving the aggregate computation unaffected.\nThe randomization technique can also suppress couplings to slow degrees of\nfreedom associated with non-Markovian evolution. Here we demonstrate the\nimplementation of Pauli-frame randomization in a superconducting circuit\nsystem, exploiting a flexible programming and control infrastructure to achieve\nthis with low effort. We use high-accuracy gate-set tomography to characterize\nin detail the properties of the circuit error, with and without the\nrandomization procedure, which allows us to make rigorous statements about\nMarkovianity as well as the nature of the observed errors. We demonstrate that\nrandomization suppresses signatures of non-Markovian evolution to statistically\ninsignificant levels, from a Markovian model violation ranging from $43\\sigma$\nto $1987\\sigma$, down to violations between $0.3\\sigma$ and $2.7\\sigma$ under\nrandomization. Moreover, we demonstrate that, under randomization, the\nexperimental errors are well described by a Pauli error model, with model\nviolations that are similarly insignificant (between $0.8\\sigma$ and\n$2.7\\sigma$).

Sub-Nyquist radars exploit the fact that the\ntarget scene is sparse facilitating the use of compressed sensing (CS) methods\nin signal recovery. In this chapter, we review several pulse-Doppler radar\nsystems based on these principles. Contrary to other CS-based designs, our\nformulations directly address the reduced-rate analog sampling in space and\ntime, avoid a prohibitive dictionary size, and are robust to noise and clutter.\nWe begin by introducing temporal sub-Nyquist processing for estimating the\ntarget locations using less bandwidth than conventional systems. This paves the\nway to cognitive radars which share their transmit spectrum with other\ncommunication services, thereby providing a robust solution for coexistence in\nspectrally crowded environments. Next, without impairing Doppler resolution, we\nreduce the dwell time by transmitting interleaved radar pulses in a scarce\nmanner within a coherent processing interval or \"slow time\".

Almost\nthree decades ago, an elegant polynomial-time algorithm was found for Maximum\nClique on unit disk graphs [Clark, Colbourn, Johnson; Discrete Mathematics\n'90]. Since then, it has been an intriguing open question whether or not\ntractability can be extended to general disk graphs.

More precisely, we obtain a\nrandomized EPTAS for computing the independence number on graphs having no\ndisjoint union of two odd cycles as an induced subgraph, bounded VC-dimension,\nand large independence number. We then address the question of computing Max\nClique for disks in higher dimensions. We show that intersection graphs of unit\nballs, like disk graphs, do not admit the complement of two odd cycles as an\ninduced subgraph. This, in combination with the first result, straightforwardly\nyields a randomized EPTAS for Max Clique on unit ball graphs. In stark\ncontrast, we show that on ball and unit 4-dimensional disk graphs, Max Clique\nis NP-hard and does not admit an approximation scheme even in\nsubexponential-time, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 18:32:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 16:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

We compare\nour results with the previously reported QPO observations and we conclude that\nthe QPOs seem to be associated with the radio outburst, independent of the\namplitude of the outburst. Finally, the different QPO time-scales are discussed\nin the context of magnetic reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

For this, we first\nconsider an offline non-convex optimization problem, which is solved exactly\nusing semidefinite programming. Based on the offline solution, we design an\nonline power allocation policy that requires minimal online computation and\nsatisfies the dynamics of energy flow at each sensor. We prove that the\nproposed online policy is asymptotically equivalent to the optimal offline\nsolution and show its convergence rate and robustness. We empirically show that\nthe estimation performance of the proposed online scheme is better than that of\nthe online scheme when channel state information about the dynamical system is\navailable in the low SNR regime. Numerical results are conducted to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 19:12:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 21:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

For small perturbations away from\nequilibrium, linear response (LR) theory provides the natural framework to\nstudy generic nonequilibrium processes. Here we use LR to derive TURs in a\nstraightforward and unified way. Our approach allows us to generalize TURs to\nsystems without local time reversal symmetry, including, for example, ballistic\ntransport, and periodically driven classical and quantum systems. We find that\nfor broken time reversal, the bounds on the relative uncertainty are controlled\nboth by dissipation and by a parameter encoding the asymmetry of the Onsager\nmatrix. We illustrate our results with an example from mesoscopic physics. We\nalso extend our approach beyond linear response: for Markovian dynamics it\nreveals a connection between the TUR and current fluctuation theorems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 20:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 23:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 23:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

We look at two basic questions: (a) what are the\nconditions on the tail of the loss function under which gradient descent\nconverges in the direction of the $L_2$ maximum-margin separator? (b) how does\nthe rate of margin convergence depend on the tail of the loss function and the\nchoice of the step size? We show that for a large family of super-polynomial\ntailed losses, gradient descent iterates on linear networks of any depth\nconverge in the direction of $L_2$ maximum-margin solution, while this does not\nhold for losses with heavier tails. Within this family, for simple linear\nmodels we show that the optimal rates with fixed step size is indeed obtained\nfor the commonly used exponentially tailed losses such as logistic loss.\nHowever, with a fixed step size the optimal convergence rate is extremely slow\nas $1/\\log(t)$, as also proved in Soudry et al.

For linear models with\nexponential loss, we further prove that the convergence rate could be improved\nto $\\log (t) /\\sqrt{t}$ by using aggressive step sizes that compensates for the\nrapidly vanishing gradients.

The origin and dynamical evolution of star clusters is an important\ntopic in stellar astrophysics. Several models have been proposed to understand\nthe formation of bound and unbound clusters and their evolution, and these can\nbe tested by examining the kinematical and dynamical properties of clusters\nover a wide range of ages and masses. Aims. We use the Gaia-ESO Survey products\nto study four open clusters (IC 2602, IC 2391, IC 4665, and NGC 2547) that lie\nin the age range between 20 and 50 Myr. Methods. We employ the gravity index\n$\\gamma$ and the equivalent width of the lithium line at 6708 $\\AA$, together\nwith effective temperature $\\rm{T_{eff}}$, and the metallicity of the stars in\norder to discard observed contaminant stars. Then, we derive the cluster radial\nvelocity dispersions $\\sigma_c$, the total cluster mass $\\rm{M}_{tot}$, and the\nhalf mass radius $r_{hm}$. Using the $Gaia$-DR1 TGAS catalogue, we\nindependently derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the clusters from the\nastrometric parameters of cluster members. Results. The intrinsic radial\nvelocity dispersions derived by the spectroscopic data are larger than those\nderived from the TGAS data, possibly due to the different masses of the\nconsidered stars. Using $\\rm{M}_{tot}$ and $r_{hm}$ we derive the virial\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma_{vir}$ and we find that three out of four clusters\nare supervirial. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis that these\nclusters are dispersing, as predicted by the \"residual gas expulsion\" scenario.\nHowever, recent simulations show that the virial ratio of young star clusters\nmay be overestimated if it is determined using the global velocity dispersion,\nsince the clusters are not fully relaxed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 20:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

In this work, we demonstrate a method for using AC\nstrain in elastoresistivity measurements. A sample experiencing AC strain has a\ntime-dependent resistivity, which modulates the voltage produced by an AC\ncurrent; this effect produces time-dependent variations in resisitivity that\nare directly proportional to the elastoresistivity, and which can be measured\nmore quickly, with less strain on the sample, and with less stringent\nrequirements for temperature stability than the previous DC technique.

At low redshifts halo major mergers or a\nsequence of successive smaller mergers are seen in the simulations to strongly\nheat the halo gas and suppress cooling, while mergers at high redshifts do not\nsuppress cooling, because the gas filaments are difficult to heat up.

Our approach determines regrasp\nactions by virtually searching for local transformations of tactile\nmeasurements that improve the quality of the grasp. First, we construct a\ntactile-based grasp quality metric using a deep convolutional neural network\ntrained on over 2800 grasps. The quality of each grasp, a continuous value\nbetween 0 and 1, is determined experimentally by measuring its resistance to\nexternal perturbations. Second, we simulate the tactile imprints associated\nwith robot motions relative to the initial grasp by performing rigid-body\ntransformations of the given tactile measurements. The newly generated tactile\nimprints are evaluated with the learned grasp quality network and the regrasp\naction is chosen to maximize the grasp quality.\n  Results show that the grasp quality network can predict the outcome of grasps\nwith an average accuracy of 85% on known objects and 75% on a cross validation\nset of 12 objects.

Furthermore, it has\nbeen argued that a large moon may be important for stabilizing conditions on a\nplanet for life. If these two features are combined, then an exoplanet can feel\na similar tidal influence from both its moon and parent star, leading to\npotentially interesting dynamics. The moon's orbital evolution depends on the\nexoplanet's initial spin period $P_0$. When $P_0$ is small, transfer of the\nexoplanet's angular momentum to the moon's orbit can cause the moon to migrate\noutward sufficiently to be stripped by the star. When $P_0$ is large, the moon\nmigrates less and the star's tidal torques spin down the exoplanet. Tidal\ninteractions then cause the moon to migrate inward until it is likely tidally\ndisrupted by the exoplanet and potentially produces rings. While one may think\nthat these findings preclude the presence of moons for the exoplanets of low\nmass stars, in fact a wide range of timescales are found for the loss or\ndestruction of the moon; it can take $\\sim10^6-10^{10}\\,{\\rm yrs}$ depending on\nthe system parameters. When the moon is still present, the combined tidal\ntorques force the exoplanet to spin asynchronously with respect to both its\nmoon and parent star, which tidally heats the exoplanet.

All IoDs have no embedded energy supply and\nthus need to perform EH before transmitting their data to the HAP. Thanks to\nits FD capability, the HAP can simultaneously receive data uplink and broadcast\nenergy-bearing signals downlink to charge IoDs. The instantaneous channel\ninformation is assumed unavailable throughout this paper. To maximize the\nsystem average throughput, we design a new throughput-oriented scheduling\nscheme, in which a single IoD with the maximum weighted residual energy is\nselected to transmit information to the HAP, while the other IoDs harvest and\naccumulate energy from the signals broadcast by the HAP. However, similar to\nmost of the existing throughput-oriented schemes, the proposed\nthroughout-oriented scheme also leads to unfair inter-user throughput because\nIoDs with better channel performance will be granted more transmission\nopportunities. To strike a balance between the system throughput and user\nfairness, we then propose a fairness-oriented scheduling scheme based on the\nnormalized accumulated energy. To evaluate the system performance, we model the\ndynamic charging/discharging processes of each IoD as a finite-state Markov\nChain.

The\nOGD-RBM is trained in two phases: (1) an online generative phase for\nunsupervised feature representation at the hidden layer and (2) a\ndiscriminative phase for classification. The online generative training begins\nwith zero neurons in the hidden layer, adds and updates the neurons to adapt to\nstatistics of streaming data in a single pass unsupervised manner, resulting in\na feature representation best suited to the data. The discriminative phase is\nbased on stochastic gradient descent and associates the represented features to\nthe class labels. We demonstrate the OGD-RBM on a set of multi-category and\nbinary classification problems for data sets having varying degrees of\nclass-imbalance. We first apply the OGD-RBM algorithm on the multi-class MNIST\ndataset to characterize the network evolution. We demonstrate that the online\ngenerative phase converges to a stable, concise network architecture, wherein\nindividual neurons are inherently discriminative to the class labels despite\nunsupervised training. We then benchmark OGD-RBM performance to other machine\nlearning, neural network and ClassRBM techniques for credit scoring\napplications using 3 public non-stationary two-class credit datasets with\nvarying degrees of class-imbalance. We report that OGD-RBM improves accuracy by\n2.5-3% over batch learning techniques while requiring at least 24%-70% fewer\nneurons and fewer training samples. This online generative training approach\ncan be extended greedily to multiple layers for training Deep Belief Networks\nin non-stationary data mining applications without the need for a priori fixed\narchitectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 07:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

One aspect of this problem is the conspicuous\nabsence of time in the Wheeler-Dewitt equation, which is the analogue of the\nSchrodinger equation for the Universal wavefunction. Page and Wootters famously\naddressed this problem by providing a mechanism for effectively introducing\ntime evolution into this timeless cosmological picture. Their method, which is\nsometimes called the conditional probability interpretation (CPI), requires the\nidentification of an internal clock system that is meant to keep time for the\nremainder of the Universe. Most investigations into this idea employ the\nidealized limit of a non-interacting clock system, the so-called ideal clock.\nHowever, by allowing for interactions, we have found the counter-intuitive\nresult that a non-interacting clock is not necessarily the optimal choice, even\nif it is `ideal'. In particular, the uncertainty that is associated with the\nphysical measurement of an atomic clock is found to decrease monotonically as\nthe interactions grow stronger. This observation, which is reinforced by a\nprevious study using a semi-classical clock, paves the way to an independent\nargument that is based on the energy conservation of any isolated system. Our\nconclusion is that ideal clocks must be prohibited from the CPI when recovering\ncosmological time evolution. Interactions are necessary for describing time\nevolution as a strict matter of principle. Lastly, we also consider the\nimplications of this result for the experience of time in the evolution of the\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 07:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-24"}

Key to this phenomenon is the appearance and interaction of\nvortices and antivortices in an angular degree of freedom---typified by the\nclassical XY model---due to thermal fluctuations. In the 2D Ising model this\nangular degree of freedom is absent in the classical case, but with the\naddition of a transverse field it can emerge from the interplay between\nfrustration and quantum fluctuations. Consequently a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)\nphase transition has been predicted in the quantum system by theory and\nsimulation. Here we demonstrate a large-scale quantum simulation of this\nphenomenon in a network of 1,800 in situ programmable superconducting flux\nqubits arranged in a fully-frustrated square-octagonal lattice. Essential to\nthe critical behavior, we observe the emergence of a complex order parameter\nwith continuous rotational symmetry, and the onset of quasi-long-range order as\nthe system approaches a critical temperature. We use a simple but previously\nundemonstrated approach to statistical estimation with an annealing-based\nquantum processor, performing Monte Carlo sampling in a chain of reverse\nquantum annealing protocols. Observations are consistent with classical\nsimulations across a range of Hamiltonian parameters. We anticipate that our\napproach of using a quantum processor as a programmable magnetic lattice will\nfind widespread use in the simulation and development of exotic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 07:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-24"}

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

To solve this, we in this paper develop an independence-checking\ncoding based (ICCB) uplink training architecture for one-ring scattering\nscenarios allowing for uniform linear arrays (ULA) deployment. Here, we not\nonly insert randomized pilots on subcarriers for channel impulse response (CIR)\nestimation, but also diversify and encode subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs)\nto convey those pilots simultaneously. The coded SAPs, though interfered by\narbitrary unknown SAPs in wireless environment, are qualified to be reliably\nidentified and decoded into the original pilots by checking the hidden channel\nindependence existing in subcarri- ers. Specifically, an independence-checking\ncoding (ICC) theory is formulated to support the encoding/decoding process in\nthis architecture. The optimal ICC code is further developed for guaranteeing a\nwell-imposed estimation of CIR while maximizing the code rate. Based on this\ncode, the identification error probability (IEP) is characterized to evaluate\nthe reliability of this architecture. Interestingly, we discover the principle\nof IEP reduction by exploiting the array spatial correlation, and prove that\nzero-IEP, i.e., perfect reliability, can be guaranteed under\ncontinuously-distributed mean angle of arrival (AoA). Besides this, a novel\nclosed form of IEP expression is derived in discretely- distributed case.\nSimulation results finally verify the effectiveness of the proposed\narchitecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 10:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

This strategy is an alternative to the traditional\nperiodic (time-based) metering where the power demand is averaged in fixed time\nperiods (e.g. every 15 minutes). The event-based approach considers two\nthresholds that trigger an event, one related to the (instantaneous) power\ndemanded, other to the accumulated energy consumed. The original work assumed\nthese thresholds fixed for the measurements. Our present contribution relaxes\nthis assumption by proposing a method to set the thresholds from the percentage\nof the peak power consumption over the period under analysis. This approach, in\ncontrast to the time-based and the fixed thresholds, better captures the actual\npower demanded when different households with diverse power demand profiles are\nstudied. In this sense, our method provides a more efficient way to store\nelectricity demand data while maintaining the estimation error (in relation to\nthe real-time power demand) under acceptable values.

Recently, it was shown that CNNs can exploit other\ninvariances, such as rotation invariance, by using group convolutions instead\nof planar convolutions. However, for reasons of performance and ease of\nimplementation, it has been necessary to limit the group convolution to\ntransformations that can be applied to the filters without interpolation. Thus,\nfor images with square pixels, only integer translations, rotations by\nmultiples of 90 degrees, and reflections are admissible.\n  Whereas the square tiling provides a 4-fold rotational symmetry, a hexagonal\ntiling of the plane has a 6-fold rotational symmetry.

Moreover, the\ndecay rate of the most subradiant modes obeys a universal scaling with a cubic\nsuppression in the number of emitters. Multi-excitation subradiant eigenstates\ncan be built from fermionic combinations of single excitation eigenstates; such\n\"fermionization\" results in multiple excitations that spatially repel one\nanother. We put forward a method to efficiently create and measure such\nsubradiant states, which can be realized with superconducting qubits. These\nmeasurement protocols probe both real-space correlations (using on-site\ndispersive readout) and temporal correlations in the emitted field (using\nphoton correlation techniques).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 11:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 18:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

States\nrepresented in this way, called Neural Network States (NNSs), were shown to\ndisplay interesting properties like the ability to efficiently capture\nlong-range quantum correlations. However, identifying an optimal neural network\nrepresentation of a given state might be challenging, and so far this problem\nhas been addressed with stochastic optimization techniques. In this work we\nexplore a different direction. We study how the action of elementary quantum\noperations modifies NNSs. We parametrize a family of many body quantum\noperations that can be directly applied to states represented by Unrestricted\nBoltzmann Machines, by just adding hidden nodes and updating the network\nparameters. We show that this parametrization contains a set of universal\nquantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum\ncircuit can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden\nnodes that grows linearly with the number of elementary operations in the\ncircuit. This is a powerful representation theorem (which was recently obtained\nwith different methods) but that is not directly useful, since there is no\ngeneral and efficient way to extract information from this unrestricted\ndescription of quantum states. To circumvent this problem, we propose a\nstep-wise procedure based on the projection of Unrestricted quantum states to\nRestricted quantum states. In turn, two approximate methods to perform this\nprojection are discussed. In this way, we show that it is in principle possible\nto approximately optimize or evolve Neural Network States without relying on\nstochastic methods such as Variational Monte Carlo, which are computationally\nexpensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 11:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

In this paper, we propose a new\ndecomposition formalism for computing the anisotropic bispectrum in redshift\nspace and for measuring it from galaxy samples. Our formalism uses tri-polar\nspherical harmonic decomposition with zero total angular momentum to compress\nthe 3D modes distribution in the redshift-space bispectrum. This approach\npreserves three fundamental properties of the Universe: statistical\nhomogeneity, isotropy, and parity-symmetry, allowing us to efficiently separate\nthe anisotropic signal induced by redshift-space distortions (RSDs) and the\nAlcock-Paczy\\'{n}ski (AP) effect from the isotropic bispectrum.

We monitored this re-brightening with\nthe INTEGRAL and Swift satellites, and in this paper we report the results of\nthe time-resolved spectral analysis of these data. The December outburst shared\nsimilar characteristics with the June one. The well sampled INTEGRAL light\ncurve shows up to 10 Crab flares, which are separated by relatively weak\nnon-flaring emission phases when compared to the June outburst. The spectra are\nwell described by absorbed Comptonization models, with hard photon indices,\n$\\Gamma \\lesssim 2$, and significant detections of a high-energy cut-off only\nduring the bright flares. This is in contrast to the June outburst, where the\nComptonization models gave electron temperatures mostly in the 30--50 keV\nrange, while some spectra were soft ($\\Gamma \\sim 2.5$) without signs of any\nspectral cut-off. Similarly to the June outburst, we see clear sings of a\nvariable local absorber in the soft energy band covered by Swift/XRT and\nINTEGRAL/JEM-X, which causes rapid spectral variations observed during the\nflares. During one flare, both Swift and INTEGRAL captured V404 Cyg in a state\nwhere the absorber was nearly Compton thick, $N_\\textrm{H} \\approx\n10^{24}\\,\\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, and the broad band spectrum was similar to obscured\nAGN spectra, as seen during the \"plateaus\" in the June outburst.

Of\nparticular interest is the tightly related question of understanding whether\ngroundstates of CLHs can be generated by efficient quantum circuits. The two\nproblems touch upon conceptual, physical and computational questions, including\nthe centrality of non-commutation in quantum mechanics, quantum PCP and the\narea law. It is natural to try to address first the more physical case of CLHs\nembedded on a 2D lattice but this problem too remained open, apart from some\nvery specific cases. Here we consider a wide class of two dimensional CLH\ninstances; these are $k$-local CLHs, for any constant $k$; they are defined on\nqubits set on the edges of any surface complex, where we require that this\nsurface complex is not too far from being \"Euclidean\". Each vertex and each\nface can be associated with an arbitrary term (as long as the terms commute).\nWe show that this class is in NP, and moreover that the groundstates have an\nefficient quantum circuit that prepares them. This result subsumes that of\nSchuch [2011] which regarded the special case of $4$-local Hamiltonians on a\ngrid with qubits, and by that it removes the mysterious feature of Schuch's\nproof which showed containment in NP without providing a quantum circuit for\nthe groundstate and considerably generalizes it. We believe this work and the\ntools we develop make a significant step towards showing that 2D CLHs are in\nNP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 14:24:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 18:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-02"}

One way to alleviate this problem is active learning, which aims to\nwhich discover the most valuable instances for labeling to construct a powerful\nclassifier. Considering both informativeness and representativeness provides a\npromising way to design a practical active learning. However, most existing\nactive learning methods select instances favoring either informativeness or\nrepresentativeness. Meanwhile, many are designed based on the binary class, so\nthat they may present suboptimal solutions on the datasets with multiple\nclasses. In this paper, a hybrid informative and representative criterion based\nmulti-class active learning approach is proposed. We combine the informative\ninformativeness and representativeness into one formula, which can be solved\nunder a unified framework. The informativeness is measured by the margin\nminimum while the representative information is measured by the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy. By minimizing the upper bound for the true risk, we generalize the\nempirical risk minimization principle to the active learning setting.\nSimultaneously, our proposed method makes full use of the label information,\nand the proposed active learning is designed based on multiple classes. So the\nproposed method is not suitable to the binary class but also the multiple\nclasses.

The\nessential idea is that measured systems always have some pre-existing\nentanglement relations with (usually larger) systems, and that apparent changes\nin conserved quantities in the measured system are correlated with compensating\nchanges in these larger systems. Since wave function collapse is mediated by\nentanglement relations a full accounting of the relevant quantities requires a\ncomputation over all interacting, entangled systems.

This new distance formula is different than the\nPythagorean theorem but converges to it for distances large relative to the\nPlanck length. First, four candidate formulas developed by different people\nover the last 70 years will be discussed. Three of the formulas are shown to be\nidentical for conditions that best describe discrete space. It is shown that\nthis new distance formula is valid for all size-scales -- from the Planck\nlength upwards -- and solves two major problems historically associated with\nthe discrete space-time (DST) model. One problem it solves is the widely\nbelieved anisotropic nature of most discrete space models. Just as commonly\nbelieved is the second problem -- the incompatibility of DST's concept of an\nimmutable atom of space and the length contraction of this atom required by\nspecial relativity. The new formula for distance in DST solves this problem. It\nis shown that length contraction of the atom of space does not occur for any\nrelative velocity of two reference frames. It is also shown that time dilation\nof the atom of time does not occur. Also discussed is the possibility of any\nobject being able to travel at the speed of light for specific temporal\ndurations given by an equation derived in this work. Also discussed is a method\nto empirical verify the discreteness of space by studying any observed\nanomalies in the motion of astronomical bodies, such as differences in the\nbodies' inertial masses and gravitational masses.

We\nderive this model from microfoundations, provide its empirical verification,\ndemonstrate that it contains the efficient market as a particular regime and\nestablish a link through which macroeconomic models can be attached for the\nstudy of real economy and stock market interaction. To examine key effects, we\nlink it with a simple macroeconomic model (Blanchard, 1981). The coupled system\ngenerates nontrivial endogenous dynamics, which exhibit deterministic and\nstochastic features, producing quasiperiodic fluctuations (business cycles). We\nalso inspect this system's behavior in the phase space. The real economy and\nthe stock market coevolve dynamically along the path governed by a\nstochastically-forced dynamical system with two stable equilibria, one where\nthe economy expands and the other where it contracts, resulting in business\ncycles identified as the coherence resonance phenomenon. Thus, the\nincorporation of stock market dynamics into the macroeconomic framework, as\npresented here, allows the derivation of realistic behaviors in a tractable\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 09:24:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 11:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 15:41:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 10:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

For this reason the reconstruction is still computed using a\nmeasured forward operator which is obtained in a time-consuming calibration\nprocess. The state of the art model used for the imaging methodology and first\nmodel-based reconstructions relies on strong model simplifications which turned\nout to cause too large modeling errors.

Stimuli can have different\nforms, for example, they can be represented by bit vectors applied to the input\nports of the processor or by programs that are loaded directly into the program\nmemory. In this paper, we propose a new technique dynamically altering\nconstraints for PRG via recurrent neural network, which receives a coverage\nfeedback from the simulation of design under verification. For the\ndemonstration purposes we used processors provided by Codasip as their coverage\nstate space is reasonably big and differs for various kinds of processors.\nNevertheless, techniques presented in this paper are widely applicable. The\nresults of experiments show that not only the coverage closure is achieved much\nsooner, but we are able to isolate a small set of stimuli with high coverage\nthat can be used for running regression tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 10:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art networks are extremely\ncompute and memory intensive which makes them unsuitable for mW-devices such as\nIoT end-nodes. Aggressive quantization of these networks dramatically reduces\nthe computation and memory footprint. Binary-weight neural networks (BWNs)\nfollow this trend, pushing weight quantization to the limit. Hardware\naccelerators for BWNs presented up to now have focused on core efficiency,\ndisregarding I/O bandwidth and system-level efficiency that are crucial for\ndeployment of accelerators in ultra-low power devices. We present Hyperdrive: a\nBWN accelerator dramatically reducing the I/O bandwidth exploiting a novel\nbinary-weight streaming approach, which can be used for arbitrarily sized\nconvolutional neural network architecture and input resolution by exploiting\nthe natural scalability of the compute units both at chip-level and\nsystem-level by arranging Hyperdrive chips systolically in a 2D mesh while\nprocessing the entire feature map together in parallel. Hyperdrive achieves 4.3\nTOp/s/W system-level efficiency (i.e., including I/Os)---3.1x higher than\nstate-of-the-art BWN accelerators, even if its core uses resource-intensive\nFP16 arithmetic for increased robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 17:35:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:25:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 11:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

The accuracy and effectiveness of this RII method is validated\nfor two fuels: n-heptane and isopentanol. The RII method determines appropriate\nDRGEP target species solely from the local thermo-chemical state of the\nsimulation, ensuring that accuracy will be maintained. Further, the RII method\nreduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP target species sets\nappropriate to the combustion phenomena under consideration. Constant volume\nautoignition simulations run over a wide range of initial condi- tions using\ndetailed reaction mechanisms for n-heptane and isopentanol show that the RII\nmethod is able to maintain accuracy even when traditional static target species\nsets fail, and are even more accurate than expert-selected target species sets.\nAdditionally, the accuracy and efficiency of the RII method are compared to\nthose of static target species sets in single-cell engine simulations under\nhomogeneous charge compression ignition conditions. For simulations using more\nstringent DRGEP thresholds, the RII method performs similarly to that of the\nstatic target species sets. With a larger DRGEP threshold, the RII method is\nsignificantly more accurate than the static target species sets without\nimposing significant computational overhead. Furthermore, the applicability of\nthe RII method to a DRG-based DAC scheme is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 23:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}
