We model the exposure prediction function as a fully convolutional\nneural network that can be trained through Gaussian policy gradient in an\nend-to-end fashion. As a result, our system can associate scene semantics with\nexposure values; it can also be extended to personalize the exposure\nadjustments for a user and device. We improve the learning performance by\nincorporating an adaptive metering module that links semantics with exposure.\nThis adaptive metering module generalizes the conventional spot or matrix\nmetering techniques.

We focus in particular on the\nrole of decorrelation of incompressible (solenoidal) homogeneous isotropic\nturbulence, which is dominated by the sweeping effect. The sweeping effect\ndescribes that turbulent decorrelation is primarily due to the small scale\neddies being swept with by large scale eddies in a stochastic manner. This\neffect reduces the gravitational wave signal produced by incompressible MHD\nturbulence by around an order of magnitude compared to previous studies.\nAdditionally, we find a more complicated dependence for the spectral shape of\nthe gravitational wave spectrum on the energy density sourced by solenoidal\nmodes (magnetic and kinetic). The high frequency tail follows either a\n$k^{-5/3}$ or a $k^{-8/3}$ power law for large and small solenoidal turbulence\ndensity parameter, respectively. Further, magnetic helicity tends to increase\nthe gravitational wave energy at low frequencies. Moreover, we show how\nsolenoidal modes might impact the gravitational wave spectrum from dilatational\nmodes e.g. sound waves. We find that solenoidal modes greatly affect the shape\nof the gravitational wave spectrum due to the sweeping effect on the\ndilatational modes. For a high velocity flow, one expects a $k^{-2}$ high\nfrequency tail, due to sweeping. In contrast, for a low velocity flow and a\nsound wave dominated flow, we expect a $k^{-3}$ high frequency tail.

In this\npaper, extensions of Bowers et al. which allow for failure time outcomes\nsubject to right censoring are proposed. Permitting right censored outcomes is\nchallenging because standard randomization-based tests of the null hypothesis\nof no treatment effect assume that whether an individual is censored does not\ndepend on treatment. The proposed extension of Bowers et al. to allow for\ncensoring entails adapting the method of Wang, Lagakos, and Gray (2010) for two\nsample survival comparisons in the presence of unequal censoring. The methods\nare examined via simulation studies and utilized to assess the effects of\ncholera vaccination in an individually-randomized trial of 73,000 children and\nwomen in Matlab, Bangladesh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 17:08:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 18:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 08:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

Due to the complicated interplay of hadronization and parton\nshower dynamics in Monte Carlo event generators relevant for kinematic\nreconstruction, relating $m_t^{\\rm MC}$ to field theory masses is a non-trivial\ntask. In this talk we report on a calibration procedure to determine this\nrelation using hadron level QCD predictions for 2-Jettiness in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation, an observable which has kinematic top mass sensitivity and a\nclose relation to the invariant mass of the particles coming from the top\ndecay. The theoretical ingredients of the QCD prediction are reviewed. Fitting\n$e^+e^-$ 2-Jettiness calculations at NLL/NNLL order to PYTHIA 8.205, we find\nthat $m_t^{\\rm MC}$ agrees with the MSR mass $m_{t,1\\,{\\rm GeV}}^{\\rm MSR}$\nwithin uncertainties.

At NNLL we find $m_t^{\\rm MC} =\nm_t^{\\rm pole} + (0.57 \\pm 0.28)\\,{\\rm GeV}$ as the fit result. In contrast,\nconverting $m_{t,1\\,{\\rm GeV}}^{\\rm MSR}$ obtained at NNLL to the pole mass\ngives a result for $m_t^{\\rm pole}$ that is substantially larger and\nincompatible with the fit result. We also explain some theoretical aspects\nrelevant for employing the C-parameter as an alternative calibration\nobservable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 18:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

Deep learning is a powerful\nmachine learning method that extracts lower level features and feeds them\nforward for the next layer to identify higher level features that improve\nperformance. However, deep neural networks have drawbacks, which include many\nhyper-parameters and infinite architectures, opaqueness into results, and\nrelatively slower convergence on smaller datasets. While traditional machine\nlearning algorithms can address these drawbacks, they are not typically capable\nof the performance levels achieved by deep neural networks. To improve\nperformance, ensemble methods are used to combine multiple base learners. Super\nlearning is an ensemble that finds the optimal combination of diverse learning\nalgorithms. This paper proposes deep super learning as an approach which\nachieves log loss and accuracy results competitive to deep neural networks\nwhile employing traditional machine learning algorithms in a hierarchical\nstructure. The deep super learner is flexible, adaptable, and easy to train\nwith good performance across different tasks using identical hyper-parameter\nvalues. Using traditional machine learning requires fewer hyper-parameters,\nallows transparency into results, and has relatively fast convergence on\nsmaller datasets. Experimental results show that the deep super learner has\nsuperior performance compared to the individual base learners, single-layer\nensembles, and in some cases deep neural networks. Performance of the deep\nsuper learner may further be improved with task-specific tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 18:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

Here we present a generalization of network symmetry\ncalled \\emph{latent symmetry}, which is an extension of the standard notion of\nsymmetry. They are defined in terms of standard symmetries in a reduced version\nof the network. One unique aspect of latent symmetries is that each one is\nassociated with a \\emph{size}, which provides a way of discussing symmetries at\nmultiple scales in a network. We are able to demonstrate a number of examples\nof networks (graphs) which contain latent symmetry, including a number of real\nnetworks. In numerical experiments, we show that latent symmetries are found\nmore frequently in graphs built using preferential attachment, a standard model\nof network growth, when compared to non-network like (Erd{\\H o}s-R\\'enyi)\ngraphs. Finally we prove that if vertices in a network are latently symmetric,\nthen they must have the same eigenvector centrality, similar to vertices which\nare symmetric in the standard sense. This suggests that the latent symmetries\npresent in real-networks may serve the same structural and functional purpose\nstandard symmetries do in these networks.

We investigate the observed relations\nbetween RVs, stellar activity, and stellar parameters of M dwarfs by analyzing\nCARMENES high-resolution visual-channel spectra ($0.5$$-$$1$$\\mu$m), which were\ntaken within the CARMENES RV planet survey during its first $20$ months of\noperation. During this time, $287$ of the CARMENES-sample stars were observed\nat least five times. From each spectrum we derived a relative RV and a measure\nof chromospheric H$\\alpha$ emission. In addition, we estimated the chromatic\nindex (CRX) of each spectrum, which is a measure of the RV wavelength\ndependence. Despite having a median number of only $11$ measurements per star,\nwe show that the RV variations of the stars with RV scatter of $>10$ m/s and a\nprojected rotation velocity $v \\sin{i}>2$ km/s are caused mainly by activity.\nWe name these stars `active RV-loud stars' and find their occurrence to\nincrease with spectral type: from $\\sim3\\%$ for early-type M dwarfs\n(M$0.0$$-$$2.5$V) through $\\sim30\\%$ for mid-type M dwarfs (M$3.0$$-$$5.5$V) to\n$>50\\%$ for late-type M dwarfs (M$6.0$$-$$9.0$V). Their RV-scatter amplitude is\nfound to be correlated mainly with $v \\sin{i}$. For about half of the stars, we\nalso find a linear RV$-$CRX anticorrelation, which indicates that their\nactivity-induced RV scatter is lower at longer wavelengths. For most of them we\ncan exclude a linear correlation between RV and H$\\alpha$ emission. Our results\nare in agreement with simulated activity-induced RV variations in M dwarfs. The\nRV variations of most active RV-loud M dwarfs are likely to be caused by dark\nspots on their surfaces, which move in and out of view as the stars rotate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 18:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

We present a formulation of the evolution equation that governs this\ncascade, the Banfi-Marchesini-Smye equation, from both an effective field\ntheory point of view and a direct diagrammatic argument. The equation uses\nexact momentum conservation, and is applicable to both scattering with initial\nand final state hard partons.

We define and compare four\ndifferent galaxy samples according to: (a) S\\'ersic indices: early-type\n('ETG'), (b) visual inspection: 'ellipticals', (c) colours: 'red', (d) spectral\nproperties: 'passive'. The classification is performed for a complete sample of\ngalaxies with m$_{\\textit{F814W}} \\le$ 22.5 ABmag (M$_{*}$ $\\gtrsim 10^{10.0}$\nM$_{\\odot}$). To derive robust galaxy structural parameters, we use two\nmethods: (1) an iterative estimate of structural parameters using images of\nincreasing size, in order to deal with closely separated galaxies and (2)\ndifferent background estimations, to deal with the Intracluster light\ncontamination. The comparison between the KRs obtained from the different\nsamples suggests that the sample selection could affect the estimate of the\nbest-fitting KR parameters. The KR built with ETGs is fully consistent with the\none obtained for ellipticals and passive. On the other hand, the KR slope built\non the red sample is only marginally consistent with those obtained with the\nother samples. We also release the photometric catalogue with structural\nparameters for the galaxies included in the present analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 19:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

The recent detection of coherent pulsations coming from three\nbright ULXs demonstrates that some of these sources are powered by accretion\nonto a neutron star, implying accretion rates significantly in excess of the\nEddington limit, a high degree of geometric beaming, or both. The physical\nchallenges associated with the high implied accretion rates can be mitigated if\nthe neutron star surface field is high - in the magnetar regime ($10^{14}$ G),\nsince this suppresses the electron scattering cross section, reducing the\nradiation pressure that chokes off accretion for high luminosities.

They bear astrophysical significance as sources of\nUV and ionizing radiation in older stellar populations and, if sufficiently\nmassive, as stripped supernova progenitors. Binary evolutionary models predict\nthem to be common, but only a handful of subdwarfs (i.e., SESs) with B-type\ncompanions are known. This could be the result of observational biases\nhindering detection, or an incorrect understanding of binary evolution. We\nreanalyze the well-studied post-interaction binary phi Persei. Recently, new\ndata improved the orbital solution of the system, which contains a ~1.2 Msun\nSES and a rapidly rotating ~9.6 Msun Be star. We compare with an extensive grid\nof evolutionary models using a Bayesian approach and find initial masses of the\nprogenitor of 7.2+/-0.4 Msun for the SES and 3.8+/-0.4 Msun for the Be star.\nThe system must have evolved through near-conservative mass transfer. These\nfindings are consistent with earlier studies. The age we obtain, 57+/-9 Myr, is\nin excellent agreement with the age of the alpha Persei cluster. We note that\nneither star was initially massive enough to produce a core-collapse supernova,\nbut mass exchange pushed the Be star above the mass threshold. We find that the\nsubdwarf is overluminous for its mass by almost an order of magnitude, compared\nto the expectations for a helium core burning star. We can only reconcile this\nif the subdwarf is in a late phase of helium shell burning, which lasts only\n2-3% of the total lifetime as a subdwarf. This could imply that up to ~50 less\nevolved, dimmer subdwarfs exist for each system similar to phi Persei. Our\nfindings can be interpreted as a strong indication that a substantial\npopulation of SESs indeed exists, but has so far evaded detection because of\nobservational biases and lack of large-scale systematic searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 19:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

While several\nproperties of multi-band superconductors can be understood as straightforward\ngeneralizations of their single-band counterparts, recent works have unveiled\nrather unusual behaviors unique to the former case. In this regard, a regime\nthat has received significant attention is that near a Lifshitz transition, in\nwhich one of the bands crosses the Fermi level. In this work, we investigate\nhow impurity scattering $\\tau^{-1}$ affects the superconducting transition\ntemperature $T_{c}$ across a Lifshitz transition, in the regime where\nintra-band pairing is dominant and inter-band pairing is subleading. This is\naccomplished by deriving analytic asymptotic expressions for $T_{c}$ and\n$\\partial T_{c}/\\partial\\tau^{-1}$ in a two-dimensional two-band system. When\nthe inter-band pairing interaction is repulsive, we find that, despite the\nincipient nature of the band crossing the Fermi level, inter-band impurity\nscattering is extremely effective in breaking Cooper pairs, making $\\partial\nT_{c}/\\partial\\tau^{-1}$ quickly approach the limiting Abrikosov-Gor'kov value\nof the high-density regime. In contrast, when the inter-band pairing\ninteraction is attractive, pair-breaking is much less efficient, affecting\n$T_{c}$ only mildly at the vicinity of the Lifshitz transition. The consequence\nof this general result is that the behavior of $T_{c}$ across a Lifshitz\ntransition can be qualitatively changed in the presence of strong enough\ndisorder: instead of displaying a sharp increase across the Lifshitz\ntransition, as in the clean case, $T_{c}$ can actually display a maximum and be\nsuppressed at the Lifshitz transition. These results shed new light on the\nnon-trivial role of impurity scattering in multi-band superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 19:27:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 18:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 20:49:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 14:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Here we show\nthat the introduction of quantum dynamics can provide a speed-up over local\nclassical algorithms in a large class of hard optimization problems. The\nessential intuition is that tunneling allows the system to explore the\noptimization landscape while approximately conserving the classical energy,\neven in the presence of large barriers. In particular, we study energy matching\nin the random p-spin model of spin glass theory. Using perturbation theory and\nnumerical exact diagonalization, we show that introducing a transverse field\nleads to three sharp dynamical phases, only one of which solves the matching\nproblem: (1) a small-field trapped phase, in which tunneling is too weak for\nthe system to escape the vicinity of the initial state; (2) a large-field\nexcited phase, in which the field excites the system into high energy states,\neffectively forgetting the initial low energy; and (3) the intermediate\ntunneling phase, in which the system succeeds at energy matching.

The inner products are\nparameterized by a space-dependent weight function $\\lambda$. At each iteration\nof the method, where an approximation to the minimizer is given by an element\n$u\\in H$, an optimal weight $\\hlambda$ is found as a solution of a nonlinear\nminimization problem in the space of weights $\\Lambda$.

To this end,\nthe concept of \"driving volatility\" is defined and explored as deviation from\nthe norm. Several measures of dispersion and variation can be computed in\ndifferent ways using vehicles' instantaneous speed, acceleration, and jerk\nobserved at intersections. This study explores different measures of\nvolatility, representing newly available surrogate measures of safety, by\ncombining data from the Michigan Safety Pilot Deployment of connected vehicles\nwith crash and inventory data at several intersections. The intersection data\nwas error-checked and verified for accuracy. Then, for each intersection, 37\ndifferent measures of volatility were calculated. These volatilities were then\nused to explain crash frequencies at intersection by estimating fixed and\nrandom parameter Poisson regression models. Results show that an increase in\nthree measures of driving volatility are positively associated with higher\nintersection crash frequency, controlling for exposure variables and geometric\nfeatures. More intersection crashes were associated with higher percentages of\nvehicle data points (speed & acceleration) lying beyond threshold-bands. These\nbands were created using mean plus two standard deviations. Furthermore, a\nhigher magnitude of time-varying stochastic volatility of vehicle speeds when\nthey pass through the intersection is associated with higher crash frequencies.\nThese measures can be used to locate intersections with high driving\nvolatilities, i.e., hot-spots where crashes are waiting to happen. Therefore, a\ndeeper analysis of these intersections can be undertaken and proactive safety\ncountermeasures considered at high volatility locations to enhance safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 21:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 17:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Its popularity stems from\nits ability to drastically reduce the computing cost of a simulation, by\nallowing the use of larger, and therefore fewer timesteps to reach a solution.\nIt is physically motivated by the fact that ionization fronts rarely propagate\nfaster than some fraction of the speed of light. However, no global proof of\nthe physical validity of this approach is available, and possible artefacts\nresulting from this approximation therefore need to be identifited and\ncharacterized to allow its proper use. In this paper we investigate the impact\nof the reduced speed of light approximation on the predicted properties of the\nintergalactic medium. To this end we use fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics\nRAMSES-CUDATON simulations of the epoch of reionization. We find that reducing\nthe speed of light by a factor 5 (20, 100) leads to overestimating the\npost-reionization volume-weighted $x_{HI}$ by a similar factor ~5 (20, 100)\nwith respect to full speed of light simulations. We show that the error is\ndriven by the hydrogen - photon chemistry. In photo-ionization equilibrium,\nreducing the speed of light has the same effect as artificially reducing the\nphoton density or the reaction cross-section and leads to an underestimated\nionizing flux. We confirm this interpretation by running additional simulations\nusing a reduced speed of light in the photon propagation module, but keeping\nthis time the full speed of light in the chemistry module. With this setup, the\npost-reionization neutral hydrogen fractions converge to the full speed of\nlight value, which validates our explanation.

The algorithmic optimality of multilevel\napproaches for common discretizations makes them a good candidate for an\nefficient parallel solver. Yet, modern architectures for high-performance\ncomputing systems continue to challenge the parallel scalability of multilevel\nsolvers. While algebraic multigrid methods are robust for solving a variety of\nproblems, the increasing importance of data locality and cost of data movement\nin modern architectures motivates the need to carefully exploit structure in\nthe problem.\n  Robust logically structured variational multigrid methods, such as Black Box\nMultigrid (BoxMG), maintain structure throughout the multigrid hierarchy. This\navoids indirection and increased coarse-grid communication costs typical in\nparallel algebraic multigrid. Nevertheless, the parallel scalability of\nstructured multigrid is challenged by coarse-grid problems where the overhead\nin communication dominates computation. In this paper, an algorithm is\nintroduced for redistributing coarse-grid problems through incremental\nagglomeration. Guided by a predictive performance model, this algorithm\nprovides robust redistribution decisions for structured multilevel solvers.\n  A two-dimensional diffusion problem is used to demonstrate the significant\ngain in performance of this algorithm over the previous approach that used\nagglomeration to one processor.

We show that for a special choice of the\npolarization tensor written in terms of the principal tensor, both the Lorenz\ngauge condition and the Maxwell equations reduce to a composition of mutually\ncommuting operators acting on the potential function. A solution to both these\nequations can be written in terms of an eigenfunction of these commuting\noperators. When incorporating a multiplicative separability ansatz, it turns\nout that the eigenvalue equations reduce to a set of separated ordinary\ndifferential equations with the eigenvalues playing a role of separability\nconstants.

For each of three sub-regions within two\nflaring active regions, we extracted time series from multiple distinct\npositions, including the flare core and quieter surrounding areas. The time\nseries were analyzed with a moving power map analysis to examine power as a\nfunction of frequency and time.

This depletion is both frequency and\ntime dependent, which probably reflects the changing depths visible during the\nflare in the bandpass of the filter. These variations are not observed outside\nthe flare cores. The depletion may indicate that acoustic energy is being\nconverted into thermal energy at flare maximum, while the low-frequency\nenhancement may arise from an instability in the chromosphere and provide an\nearly warning of the flare onset. Dark lanes of reduced wave power are also\nvisible in the power maps, which may arise from the interaction of the acoustic\nwaves and the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 02:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

We analyze the phase\ndiagram as a function of the strength of both the dipolar interaction and a\ntransverse electric field. The study reveals the existence of a class of\norientational phases of quantum dipolar rotors whose properties are determined\nby the ratios between the strength anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction, the\nstrength of the applied transverse field, and the rotational constant. For the\ntriangular lattice, the generic orientationally disordered phase found at zero\nand weak values of both dipolar interaction strength and applied field, is\nfound to show a transition to a phase characterized by net polarization in the\nlattice plane as the strength of the dipole-dipole interaction is increased,\nindependent of the strength of the applied transverse field, in addition to the\nexpected transition to a transverse polarized phase as the electric field\nstrength increases. The square lattice is also found to exhibit a transition\nfrom a disordered phase to an ordered phase as the dipole-dipole interaction\nstrength is increased, as well as the expected transition to a transverse\npolarized phase as the electric field strength increases. In contrast to the\nsituation with a triangular lattice, on square lattices the ordered phase at\nhigh dipole-dipole interaction strength possesses a striped ordering.

We highlight how the coupling between quantized\nlight and matter changes the usual response functions and introduces new types\nof cross-correlated light-matter response functions. These cross-correlation\nresponses lead to measurable changes in Maxwell's equations due to the\nquantum-matter-mediated photon-photon interactions. Key features of treating\nthe combined matter-photon response are that natural lifetimes of excitations\nbecome directly accessible from first principles, changes in the electronic\nstructure due to strong light-matter coupling are treated fully\nnon-perturbatively, and for the first time self-consistent solutions of the\nback-reaction of matter onto the photon vacuum and vice versa are accounted\nfor. By introducing a straightforward extension of the random-phase\napproximation for the coupled matter-photon problem, we calculate the first\nab-initio spectra for a real molecular system that is coupled to the quantized\nelectromagnetic field. Our approach can be solved numerically very efficiently.\nThe presented framework leads to a shift in paradigm by highlighting how\nelectronically excited states arise as a modification of the photon field and\nthat experimentally observed effects are always due to a complex interplay\nbetween light and matter.

Thus, the estimated composition depends strongly on the\nparticular model used for its interpretation. To reduce this model dependency\nin the interpretation of the mass composition, we have developed a novel\napproach which allows the adjustment of the normalisation levels of the proton\n$<X_\\text{max}>$ and $\\sigma (X_\\text{max})$ guided by real observations of\n$X_\\text{max}$ distributions. In this paper we describe the details of this\napproach and present a study of its performance and its limitations.

We have obtained a\nconsistent mass composition interpretation for Epos-LHC, QGSJetII-04 and\nSibyll2.3. Our fits suggest a composition consisting of predominantly iron.\nBelow $10^{18.8}$ eV, the small proportions of proton, helium and nitrogen\nvary. Above $10^{18.8}$ eV, there is little proton or helium, and with\nincreasing energy the nitrogen component gradually gives way to the growing\niron component, which dominates at the highest energies. The fits suggest that\nthe normalisation level for proton $<X_\\mathrm{max}>$ is much deeper than the\ninitial predictions of the hadronic interaction models. The fitted\nnormalisation level for proton $\\sigma (X_\\text{max})$ is also greater than the\nmodel predictions. When fixing the expected normalisation of\n$\\sigma(X_\\mathrm{max})$ to that suggested by the QGSJetII-04 model, a slightly\nlarger fraction of protons is obtained. These results remain sensitive to the\nother model parameters that we keep fixed, such as the elongation rate and the\n$<X_\\text{max}>$ separation between p and Fe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 04:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

As a result, conventional network embedding\ntechniques cannot work on such HINs. Recently, metapath-based approaches have\nbeen proposed to characterize relationships in HINs, but they are ineffective\nin capturing rich contexts and semantics between nodes for embedding learning,\nmainly because (1) metapath is a rather strict single path node-node\nrelationship descriptor, which is unable to accommodate variance in\nrelationships, and (2) only a small portion of paths can match the metapath,\nresulting in sparse context information for embedding learning. In this paper,\nwe advocate a new metagraph concept to capture richer structural contexts and\nsemantics between distant nodes.

A system of agents each with limited memory\nand communication, as well as the ability to replicate and self-destruct, is\nsubjected to attacks by a worst-case adversary that can at a bounded rate (1)\ndelete agents chosen arbitrarily and (2) insert additional agents with\narbitrary initial state into the system. The goal is perpetually to maintain a\npopulation whose size is within a constant factor of the target size $N$. The\nproblem is inspired by the ability of complex biological systems composed of a\nmultitude of memory-limited individual cells to maintain a stable population\nsize in an adverse environment. Such biological mechanisms allow organisms to\nheal after trauma or to recover from excessive cell proliferation caused by\ninflammation, disease, or normal development.\n  We present a population stability protocol in a communication model that is a\nsynchronous variant of the population model of Angluin et al. In each round,\npairs of agents selected at random meet and exchange messages, where at least a\nconstant fraction of agents is matched in each round. Our protocol uses\nthree-bit messages and $\\omega(\\log^2 N)$ states per agent. We emphasize that\nour protocol can handle an adversary that can both insert and delete agents, a\nsetting in which existing approximate counting techniques do not seem to apply.\nThe protocol relies on a novel coloring strategy in which the population size\nis encoded in the variance of the distribution of colors. Individual agents can\nlocally obtain a weak estimate of the population size by sampling from the\ndistribution, and make individual decisions that robustly maintain a stable\nglobal population size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 06:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

Its computational bottleneck is the\ninversion of a covariance matrix, which takes $O(n^3)$ time in general and\nbecomes prohibitive for large n, where n is the number of design points.\nMoreover, the covariance matrix is often ill-conditioned for large n, and thus\nthe inversion is prone to numerical instability, resulting in erroneous\nparameter estimation and prediction. These two numerical issues preclude the\nuse of stochastic kriging at a large scale. This paper presents a novel\napproach to address them. We construct a class of covariance functions, called\nMarkovian covariance functions (MCFs), which have two properties: (i) the\nassociated covariance matrices can be inverted analytically, and (ii) the\ninverse matrices are sparse. With the use of MCFs, the inversion-related\ncomputational time is reduced to $O(n^2)$ in general, and can be further\nreduced by orders of magnitude with additional assumptions on the simulation\nerrors and design points. The analytical invertibility also enhance the\nnumerical stability dramatically. The key in our approach is that we identify a\ngeneral functional form of covariance functions that can induce sparsity in the\ncorresponding inverse matrices. We also establish a connection between MCFs and\nlinear ordinary differential equations. Such a connection provides a flexible,\nprincipled approach to constructing a wide class of MCFs. Extensive numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that stochastic kriging with MCFs can handle\nlarge-scale problems in an both computationally efficient and numerically\nstable manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 09:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

In order to understand this KaiABC\nclockwork, we need to analyze both the macroscopic synchronization of a large\nnumber of KaiC hexamers and the microscopic reactions and structural changes in\nindividual KaiC molecules. In the present paper, we explain two coarse-grained\ntheoretical models, the many-molecule (MM) model and the single-molecule (SM)\nmodel, to bridge the gap between macroscopic and microscopic understandings. In\nthe simulation results with these models, ATP hydrolysis drives oscillation of\nindividual KaiC hexamers and ATP hydrolysis is necessary for synchronizing\noscillations of a large number of KaiC hexamers. Sensitive temperature\ndependence of the lifetime of the ADP bound state in the CI domain of KaiC\nhexamers makes the oscillation period temperature insensitive. ATPase activity\nis correlated to the frequency of phosphorylation oscillation in the single\nmolecule of KaiC hexamer, which should be the origin of the observed\nensemble-level correlation between the ATPase activity and the frequency of\nphosphorylation oscillation.

They\ncan be generated by a flow of charge along a non-magnetic metal having a large\nspin-orbit coupling. It produces a spin accumulation at its surfaces,\ncontrollable by the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnetic layer.\nParamagnetic metals typically used are close to a ferromagnetic instability and\nthus magnetic proximity effects can contribute to the observed\nangular-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR). As interface phenomena govern the\nspin conductance across the metal/ferromagnetic-insulator heterostructures,\nunraveling these distinct contributions is pivotal to full understanding of\nspin current conductance. We report here x-ray absorption and magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) at Pt-M and (Co,Fe)-L absorption edges and atomically-resolved\nenergy loss electron spectroscopy (EELS) data of Pt/CoFe2O4 bilayers where\nCoFe2O4 layers have been capped by Pt grown at different temperatures. It turns\nout that the ADMR differs dramatically, being either dominated by spin Hall\nmagnetoresistance (SMR) associated to spin Hall effect or anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance (AMR). The XMCD and EELS data indicate that the Pt layer\ngrown at room temperature does not display any magnetic moment, whereas when\ngrown at higher temperature it is magnetic due to interfacial Pt-(Co,Fe)\nalloying. These results allow disentangling spin accumulation from interfacial\nchemical reconstructions and for tailoring the angular dependent\nmagnetoresistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 12:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

The equivalent problem of generating random 0,1 matrices with\nfixed row and column sums is frequently used as a quantitative tool in ecology.\nIt has however proven very challenging to design sampling algorithms that are\nboth fast and unbiased.\n  This article focusses on Markov chain approaches for sampling, where a\nclose-to-random graph is produced by applying a large number N of small changes\nto a given graph. Examples are the switch chain and Curveball chain, which are\nboth commonly used by practitioners as they are easy to implement and known to\nsample unbiased when N is large enough. Within theoretical research, much\neffort has gone into proving bounds on N.

Clonal expansion\nrate increases non-linearly by radon concentration showing a plateau above a\ngiven exposure rate. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Earlier we\nproposed that progenitor cell hyperplasia may be induced upon chronic radon\nexposure. The objective of the present study is to test whether the induction\nof hyperplasia may provide a quantitative explanation for the plateau in clonal\nexpansion rate. For this purpose, numerical epithelium models were prepared\nwith different number of basal cells. Cell nucleus hits were computed by an\nown-developed Monte-Carlo code. Surviving fractions were estimated based on the\nnumber of cell nucleus hits. Cell division rate was computed supposing\nequilibrium between cell death and cell division. It was also supposed that\nclonal expansion rate is proportional to cell division rate, and therefore the\nrelative increase in cell division rate and clonal expansion rate are the same\nfunctions of exposure rate. While the simulation results highly depend on model\nparameters with high uncertainty, a parameter set has been found resulting in a\ncell division rate exposure rate relationship corresponding to the plateau in\nclonal expansion rate. Due to the high uncertainty of the applied parameters,\nhowever, further studies are required to decide whether the induction of\nhyperplasia is responsible for the non-linear increase in clonal expansion rate\nor not.

In contrast to conventional spin transfer torque magnetic\nrandom access memory (STT-MRAM) wherein the demagnetizing energy opposes the\ninterfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (iPMA), in these novel memory\ncells, both PSA and iPMA contributions favor out-of-plane orientation of the\nstorage layer magnetization. Using thicker storage layers in these PSA-STT-MRAM\nhas several advantages. Thanks to the PSA, very high and easily tunable thermal\nstability factors can be achieved, even down to sub-10 nm diameters. Moreover,\nlow damping material can be used for the thick FM material thus leading to a\nreduction of the write current. The paper describes this new PSA-STT-MRAM\nconcept, practical realization of such memory arrays, magnetic characterization\ndemonstrating thermal stability factor above 200 for MTJs as small as 8nm in\ndiameter and possibility to maintain thermal stability factor above 60 down to\n4nm diameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 14:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

We\nexamine this issue using 1D stellar models constructed using Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). First, we consider standard models\nthat do not explicitly include rotational/magnetic effects, with convective\ninhibition modeled by decreasing a depth-independent mixing length theory (MLT)\nparameter $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$ (following Cox et al. 1981; Chabrier et al.\n2007). We provide formulae linking changes in $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$ to changes\nin the interior specific entropy, and hence to the stellar radius. Next, we\nmodify the MLT formulation in MESA to mimic explicitly the influence of\nrotation and magnetism, using formulations suggested by Stevenson (1979) and\nMacDonald & Mullan (2014) respectively. We find rapid rotation in these models\nhas a negligible impact on stellar structure, primarily because a star's\nadiabat, and hence its radius, is predominantly affected by layers near the\nsurface; convection is rapid and largely uninfluenced by rotation there.\nMagnetic fields, if they influenced convective transport in the manner\ndescribed by MacDonald & Mullan (2014), could lead to more noticeable radius\ninflation. Finally, we show that these non-standard effects on stellar\nstructure can be fabricated using a depth-dependent $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$: a\nnon-magnetic, non-rotating model can be produced that is virtually\nindistinguishable from one that explicitly parameterizes rotation and/or\nmagnetism using the two formulations above.

Those\nsatellites allow study of the mass, and hence density and internal structure.\nWe study here the properties of the triple asteroid (107) Camilla from\nlightcurves, stellar occultations, optical spectroscopy, and high-contrast and\nhigh-angular-resolution images and spectro-images. Using 80 positions over 15\nyears, we determine the orbit of its larger satellite to be circular,\nequatorial, and prograde, with RMS residuals of 7.8 mas. From 11 positions in\nthree epochs only, in 2015 and 2016, we determine a preliminary orbit for the\nsecond satellite. We find the orbit to be somewhat eccentric and slightly\ninclined to the primary's equatorial plane, reminiscent of the inner satellites\nof other asteroid triple systems. Comparison of the near-infrared spectrum of\nthe larger satellite reveals no significant difference with Camilla. Hence,\nthese properties argue for a formation of the satellites by excavation from\nimpact and re-accumulation of ejecta. We determine the spin and 3-D shape of\nCamilla.

However, the huge demand for more regular inspections as\ninfrastructure ages, coupled with the limited time window available for\ninspection, has rendered manual inspection increasingly insufficient. With\nshortened inspection time and reduced labor cost, automated inspection using a\ncombination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground vehicles (cars) has\nemerged as an attractive alternative to manual inspection. In this paper, we\npropose a path planning framework that generates optimal plans for UAVs and\ncars to inspect water canals in a large agricultural area (tens of square\nkilometers). In addition to optimality, the paths need to satisfy several\nconstraints, in order to guarantee UAV navigation safety and to abide by local\ntraffic regulations. In the proposed framework, the canal and road networks are\nfirst modeled as two graphs, which are then partitioned into smaller subgraphs\nthat can be covered by a given fleet of UAVs within one battery charge. The\nproblem of finding optimal paths for both UAVs and cars on the graphs, subject\nto the constraints, is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP).\nThe proposed framework can also quickly generate new plans when a current plan\nis interrupted. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by\nsimulation results showing the successful generation of plans covering all\ngiven canal segments, and the ability to quickly revise the plan when\nconditions change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 15:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

Typically, only the adjacency matrix is used to perform\nSBM parameter inference. In this paper, we consider circumstances in which\nnodes have an associated vector of continuous attributes that are also used to\nlearn the node-to-community assignments and corresponding SBM parameters. While\nthis assumption is not realistic for every application, our model assumes that\nthe attributes associated with the nodes in a network's community can be\ndescribed by a common multivariate Gaussian model. In this augmented,\nattributed SBM, the objective is to simultaneously learn the SBM connectivity\nprobabilities with the multivariate Gaussian parameters describing each\ncommunity. While there are recent examples in the literature that combine\nconnectivity and attribute information to inform community detection, our model\nis the first augmented stochastic block model to handle multiple continuous\nattributes. This provides the flexibility in biological data to, for example,\naugment connectivity information with continuous measurements from multiple\nexperimental modalities. Because the lack of labeled network data often makes\ncommunity detection results difficult to validate, we highlight the usefulness\nof our model for two network prediction tasks: link prediction and\ncollaborative filtering. As a result of fitting this attributed stochastic\nblock model, one can predict the attribute vector or connectivity patterns for\na new node in the event of the complementary source of information\n(connectivity or attributes, respectively).

One way to address the problem of how\nthis uncertainty impacts the solution is to expand the solution using\npolynomial chaos expansions and obtain a system of differential equations for\nthe evolution of the expansion coefficients. We present an application of the\nMori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism to the problem of constructing reduced models of\nsuch systems of differential equations. In particular, we construct reduced\nmodels for a subset of the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients that are\nneeded for a full description of the uncertainty caused by uncertain parameters\nor initial conditions.\n  Even though the MZ formalism is exact, its straightforward application to the\nproblem of constructing reduced models for estimating uncertainty involves the\ncomputation of memory terms whose cost can become prohibitively expensive. For\nthose cases, we present a Markovian reformulation of the MZ formalism which can\nlead to approximations that can alleviate some of the computational expense\nwhile retaining an accuracy advantage over reduced models that discard the\nmemory altogether. Our results support the conclusion that successful reduced\nmodels need to include memory effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 23:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

They can thus be\nregarded as amalgamations of three different types of mappings, one that\nconnects particle spinors directly forming representations to internal gauge\nsymmetries to their spacetime counterparts that are embodied by null flags,\nanother that translates the spacetime spinors into their corresponding tensors\nexpressed in an orthonormal tetrad, and finally a purely tensorial\ntransformation into the coordinate tetrad. The splitting of spinors into\nparticle and spacetime varieties is not usually practised, but we advocate its\nadoption for better physical clarity, in terms of distinguishing internal and\nspacetime transformations, and also for understanding the scattering of\nneutrinos by spacetime curvature. We construct the basic infrastructure\nrequired for this task, and provide a worked example for the Schwarzschild\nspacetime. Our investigation also uncovers a possible under-determinacy in the\nflavoured Dirac-Weyl equation, which could serve as a new incision point for\nintroducing flavour oscillation mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 03:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}
