Therefore, it is crucial to develop lower bounds, which can\nprovide useful information about the behaviour of localizable entanglement, and\nwhich can be determined by measuring a limited number of operators, or by\nperforming least number of measurements on the state, preferably without\nperforming a full state tomography. In this paper, we adopt two different yet\nrelated approaches to obtain a witness-based, and a measurement-based lower\nbounds for localizable entanglement. The former is determined by the minimal\namount of entanglement that can be present in a subsystem of the multipartite\nquantum state, which is consistent with the expectation value of an\nentanglement witness. Determining this bound does not require any information\nabout the state beyond the expectation value of the witness operator, which\nrenders this approach highly practical in experiments. The latter bound of\nlocalizable entanglement is computed by restricting the local projection\nmeasurements over the qubits outside the subsystem of interest to a suitably\nchosen basis.

The 1.2 mm\ncontinuum map reveals, for the first time, a total of 9 compact (r < 0.01pc)\ndust condensations located within a distance of ~0.03 pc from the dissociation\nfront of the PDR. Part of the dust condensations are seen in spectral line\nemissions of CS (5-4) and H$_2$CS ($7_{1,7}$-$6_{1,6}$), though the CS map also\nreveals dense gas further away from the dissociation front. We detect compact\nemissions in H$_2$CS ($6_{0,6}$-$5_{0,5}$), ($6_{2,4}$-$5_{2,3}$) and\nC$^{34}$S, C$^{33}$S (4-3) toward bright dust condensations. The line ratio of\nH$_2$CS ($6_{0,6}$-$5_{0,5}$)/($6_{2,4}$-$5_{2,3}$) suggests a temperature of\n$73\\pm58$ K. A non-thermal velocity dispersion of ~0.25 - 0.50 km s$^{-1}$ is\nderived from the high spectral resolution C$^{34}$S data, and indicates a\nsubsonic to transonic turbulence in the condensations. The masses of the\ncondensations are estimated from the dust emission, and range from 0.03 to 0.3\n$M_{\\odot}$, all significantly lower than any critical mass that is required\nfor self-gravity to play a crucial role. Thus the condensations are not\ngravitationally bound, and could not collapse to form stars. In cooperating\nwith recent high resolution observations of the surface layers of the molecular\ncloud in the Bar, we speculate that the condensations are produced as a\nhigh-pressure wave induced by the expansion of the HII region compresses and\nenters the cloud. A velocity gradient along a direction perpendicular to the\nmajor axis of the Bar is seen in H$_2$CS ($7_{1,7}$-$6_{1,6}$), and is\nconsistent with the scenario that the molecular gas behind the dissociation\nfront is being compressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 17:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

In the absence of additional cost the best response\ntrait practically dominates the whole snow-drift game parameter space which is\nin agreement with the average payoff difference of basic models.

Such\nwinds would interact with and shock the gas around the quasar and in the host\ngalaxy, resulting in acceleration of relativistic particles and the consequent\nsynchrotron emission observed in the radio.

By comparing our CO (2-1) observations\nwith previously published CO (1-0) data, we find that the CO (2-1)/(1-0) line\nratio increases from low (~5 km s$^{-1}$) to moderate (~8 - 12 km s$^{-1}$)\nvelocities, and then decreases at higher velocities. This is qualitatively\nconsistent with the scenario that the molecular outflow is driven by multiple\nbow-shocks. We also revisit the position-velocity diagram of the CO (1-0) data,\nand find two spur structures along the outflow axis, which are further evidence\nfor the presence of multiple jet bow-shocks. Finally, power-law fittings to the\nmass spectrum of the outflow gives power law indexes more consistent with the\njet bow-shock model than the wide-angle wind model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2018 17:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

Interestingly, we need the notion of\nhigh dimensional expansion (and not only one dimensional expansion) for\nobtaining large distance lattices which are dense.\n  Our construction is obtained by proving the existence of bounded degree high\ndimensional cosystolic expanders over any ring, and in particular over\n$\\mathbb{Z}$. Previous bounded degree cosystolic expanders were known only over\n$\\mathbb{F}_2$. The proof of the cosystolic expansion over any ring is composed\nof two main steps, each of an independent interest: We show that coboundary\nexpansion over any ring of the links of a bounded degree complex implies that\nthe complex is a cosystolic expander over any ring. We then prove that all the\nlinks of Ramanujan complexes (which are called spherical buildings) are\ncoboundary expanders over any ring.\n  We follow the strategy of [LMM16] for proving that the spherical building is\na coboundary expander over any ring.

If certain\nparameters of the loss function such as smoothness or strong convexity\nconstants are known, theoretical learning rate schedules can be applied.\nHowever, in practice, such parameters are not known, and the loss function of\ninterest is not convex in any case. The recently proposed batch normalization\nreparametrization is widely adopted in most neural network architectures today\nbecause, among other advantages, it is robust to the choice of Lipschitz\nconstant of the gradient in loss function, allowing one to set a large learning\nrate without worry. Inspired by batch normalization, we propose a general\nnonlinear update rule for the learning rate in batch and stochastic gradient\ndescent so that the learning rate can be initialized at a high value, and is\nsubsequently decreased according to gradient observations along the way. The\nproposed method is shown to achieve robustness to the relationship between the\nlearning rate and the Lipschitz constant, and near-optimal convergence rates in\nboth the batch and stochastic settings ($O(1/T)$ for smooth loss in the batch\nsetting, and $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ for convex loss in the stochastic setting).

Much of this work is empirical. Interesting\nphenomena have been observed that require theoretical explanations; however the\nnon-convexity of the loss functions complicates the analysis. Recently it has\nbeen proposed that the success of these techniques rests partly in the\neffectiveness of the simple stochastic gradient descent algorithm in the so\ncalled interpolation limit in which all labels are fit perfectly. This analysis\nis made possible since the SGD algorithm reduces to a stochastic linear system\nnear the interpolating minimum of the loss function. Here we exploit this\ninsight by presenting and analyzing a new distributed algorithm for gradient\ndescent, also in the interpolating limit. The distributed SGD algorithm\npresented in the paper corresponds to gradient descent applied to a simple\npenalized distributed loss function, $L({\\bf w}_1,...,{\\bf w}_n) = \\Sigma_i\nl_i({\\bf w}_i) + \\mu \\sum_{<i,j>}|{\\bf w}_i-{\\bf w}_j|^2$. Here each node holds\nonly one sample, and its own parameter vector. The notation $<i,j>$ denotes\nedges of a connected graph defining the links between nodes.

In contrast with\nprevious usage of similar penalty functions to enforce consensus between nodes,\nin the interpolating limit it is not required to take the penalty parameter to\ninfinity for consensus to occur.

Second, we collect a\ndata set of recently signed malware and we use it to study the relationships\namong malware developers, malware families and the certificates.

We\nalso find that the need to bypass platform protections such as Microsoft\nDefender SmartScreen plays a growing role in driving the demand for\nAuthenticode certificates.

The first metric, termed\nBalanced Index (BI), is fast to compute and assigns top values to two kinds of\nnodes: those with high resistance to adoption, and those with large out-degree.\nThis is done by linearly combining three properties of a node: its degree,\nsusceptibility to new opinions, and the impact its activation will have on its\nneighborhood. Controlling the weights between those three terms has a huge\nimpact on performance. The second metric, termed Group Performance Index (GPI),\nmeasures performance of each node as an initiator when it is a part of randomly\nselected initiator set. In each such selection, the score assigned to each\nteammate is inversely proportional to the number of initiators causing the\ndesired spread.

This property has been\npredicted to support an extraordinarily long spin lifetime of carriers\npromising for spintronics applications. The PST is known to emerge when the\nstrengths of two dominant spin-orbit couplings, the Rashba and linear\nDresselhaus, are equal. This condition, however, is not trivial to achieve and\nrequires tuning the Rashba and Dresselhaus parameters, as has been demonstrated\nwith semiconductor quantum-well structures.

Recently, many deep hashing methods have been\nproposed and shown largely improved performance over traditional\nfeature-learning-based methods. Most of these methods examine the pairwise\nsimilarity on the semantic-level labels, where the pairwise similarity is\ngenerally defined in a hard-assignment way. That is, the pairwise similarity is\n'1' if they share no less than one class label and '0' if they do not share\nany. However, such similarity definition cannot reflect the similarity ranking\nfor pairwise images that hold multiple labels. In this paper, a new deep\nhashing method is proposed for multi-label image retrieval by re-defining the\npairwise similarity into an instance similarity, where the instance similarity\nis quantified into a percentage based on the normalized semantic labels. Based\non the instance similarity, a weighted cross-entropy loss and a minimum mean\nsquare error loss are tailored for loss-function construction, and are\nefficiently used for simultaneous feature learning and hash coding.

A single Majorana box represents a Coulomb-blockaded\nmesoscopic superconductor proximitizing two or more long topological nanowires.\nThe box thus harbors at least four Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Setups with\nseveral Majorana boxes, where MZMs on different boxes are tunnel-coupled via\nshort nanowire segments, are key ingredients to recent Majorana qubit and code\nnetwork proposals. We construct and study the low-energy theory for\nmulti-terminal junctions with normal leads connected to the coupled box device\nby lead-MZM tunnel contacts. Transport experiments in such setups can test the\nnonlocality of Majorana-based systems and the integrity of the underlying\nMajorana qubits. For a single box, we recover the previously described\ntopological Kondo effect which can be captured by a purely bosonic theory. For\nseveral coupled boxes, however, non-conserved local fermion parities require\nthe inclusion of additional local sets of Pauli operators. We present a\nrenormalization group analysis and develop a nonperturbative strong-coupling\napproach to quantum transport in such systems. Our findings are illustrated for\nseveral examples, including a loop qubit device and different two-box setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 08:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 06:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

The discretization in space and\ntime is based on continuous finite element methods. The post-processing lifts\nthe fully discrete approximations in time from continuous to continuously\ndifferentiable ones. Further, it increases the order of convergence of the\ndiscretization in time which can be be exploited nicely, for instance, for\na-posteriori error control. The convergence behavior is shown by proving error\nestimates of optimal order in various norms. A bound of superconvergence at the\ndiscrete times nodes is included. To show the error estimates, a special\napproach is developed. Firstly, error estimates for the time derivative of the\npost-processed solution are proved. Then, in a second step these results are\nused to establish the desired error estimates for the post-processed solution\nitself. The need for this approach comes through the structure of the wave\nequation providing only stability estimates that preclude us from using\nabsorption arguments for the control of certain error quantities. A further key\ningredient of this work is the construction of a new time-interpolate of the\nexact solution that is needed in an essential way for deriving the error\nestimates. Finally, a conservation of energy property is shown for the\npost-processed solution which is a key feature for approximation schemes to\nwave equations.

These\nalgorithms are useful for large networks of small devices such as the Internet\nof Things, for wireless or ad-hoc networks, and, in general, as memory\nefficient algorithms. We introduce the Compact Message Passing(CMP) model;an\nextension of the standard message passing model considered at a finer\ngranularity where a node can interleave reads and writes with internal\ncomputations, using a port only once in a round. The interleaving is required\nfor meaningful computations due to the low memory requirement and is akin to a\ndistributed network with nodes executing streaming algorithms. Note that the\ninternal memory size upper bounds the message sizes and hence e.g. for\nlog-memory, the model is weaker than the Congest model; for such models our\nalgorithms will work directly too.

The PSB galaxy\npopulation represents about 4.5% of the full sample. Dwarf galaxies (Mr >\n-18.0) account for about 70 - 80% of PSBs, which indicates that most of the\ngalaxies undergoing recent quenching are low-mass objects. Independently of the\nenvironment, PSB galaxies are disk-like objects with g - r colour between the\nblue ELs and the red PAS ones. The PSB and EL galaxies in low-density\nenvironments show similar luminosities and local galaxy densities. The dynamics\nand local galaxy density of the PSB population in high density environments are\nshared with PAS galaxies. However, PSB galaxies inside A85 are at shorter\nclustercentric radius than PAS and EL ones. The value of the EW(Hdelta) is\nlarger for those PSBs closer to the cluster centre. We propose two different\nphysical mechanisms producing PSB galaxies depending on the environment. In low\ndensity environments, gas-rich minor mergers or accretions could produce the\nPSB galaxies.

To address this problem, we propose a\nHierarchically Heuristic Learning Strategy (HHLS) under the hierarchical social\nlearning framework, in which subordinate agents report their information to\ntheir supervisors, while supervisors can generate instructions (rules and\nsuggestions) based on the information collected from their subordinates.\nSubordinate agents heuristically update their strategies based on both their\nown experience and the instructions from their supervisors.

By stringing the cells\ntogether and imposing structural constraints that regulate their interaction,\nMAC effectively learns to perform iterative reasoning processes that are\ndirectly inferred from the data in an end-to-end approach. We demonstrate the\nmodel's strength, robustness and interpretability on the challenging CLEVR\ndataset for visual reasoning, achieving a new state-of-the-art 98.9% accuracy,\nhalving the error rate of the previous best model.

However, tiny modulations of the dominant radial-mode\npulsation were recently found to be very frequent, possibly ubiquitous in\nCepheids, which makes secondary modes difficult to detect and analyse, since\nthese modulations can easily mask the potentially weak secondary modes. The aim\nof this study is to re-investigate the secondary mode content in the sample of\nOGLE-III and -IV single-mode classical Cepheids using kernel regression with\nadaptive kernel width for pre-whitening, instead of using a constant-parameter\nmodel. This leads to a more precise removal of the modulated dominant\npulsation, and enables a more complete survey of secondary modes with\nfrequencies outside a narrow range around the primary. Our analysis reveals\nthat significant secondary modes occur more frequently among first overtone\nCepheids than previously thought.

We have reinvestigated the Kondo singlet by means of the newly\ndeveloped natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) method. We find that,\nin the framework of natural orbitals formalism, the Kondo screening mechanism\nbecomes transparent and simple, while the intrinsic structure of Kondo singlet\nis clearly resolved. For a single impurity Kondo system, there exits a single\nactive natural orbital which screens the magnetic impurity dominantly. In the\nperspective of entanglement, the magnetic impurity is entangled dominantly with\nthe active natural orbital, i.e., the subsystem formed by the active natural\norbital and the magnetic impurity basically disentangles from the remaining\nsystem. We have also studied the structures of the active natural orbital\nrespectively projected into real space and momentum space. Moreover, the\ndynamical properties, represented by one-particle Green's functions defined at\nimpurity site with active natural orbital, were obtained by using correction\nvector method. In order to clarify the spatial extension of the Kondo screening\ncloud, the concept of Kondo correlation energy was introduced. With this\nconcept we obtain a characteristic length scale beyond which the Kondo\nscreening cloud is hardly detected in experiment.

For many real applications, their actual effect and\nconvenience depend on the properties (e.g. stationary distribution and hitting\ntime) of random walks, with biased random walks often outperforming traditional\nunbiased random walks (TURW). In this paper, we present a new class of biased\nrandom walks, non-backtracking centrality based random walks (NBCRW) on a\nnetwork, where the walker prefers to jump to neighbors with high\nnon-backtracking centrality that has some advantages over eigenvector\ncentrality. We study some properties of the non-backtracking matrix of a\nnetwork, on the basis of which we propose a theoretical framework for fast\ncomputation of the transition probabilities, stationary distribution, and\nhitting times for NBCRW on the network. Within the paradigm, we study NBCRW on\nsome model and real networks and compare the results with those corresponding\nto TURW and maximal entropy random walks (MERW), with the latter being biased\nrandom walks based on eigenvector centrality. We show that the behaviors of\nstationary distribution and hitting times for NBCRW widely differ from those\nassociated with TURW and MERW, especially for heterogeneous networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 13:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

A\nstandard AdS-superconductor model can then be used to analyze the fermionic gap\nformation. We investigate the role of four-fermion interactions, which might be\nused to include the gapped QCD interactions, on the vacuum and metastable vacua\nof the model.

The result is a holographic description of the QCD colour\nsuperconducting phase diagram. We take a first look at how quark mass enters\nand causes a transition between the colour flavour locked phase and the 2SC\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 14:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 15:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

In\nsome respects, the PNCMO theory is a generalization of the well-known simple\nPMO theory: First, the usual diagonalization problem (and/or the eigenvalue\nequation) for a certain model Hamiltonian matrix ($\\mathbf{H}$) is now replaced\nby two interrelated non-canonical one-electron problems, namely by the\nblock-diagonalization problem for the matrix $\\mathbf{H}$\\ following from the\nBrillouin theorem and determining non-canonical (localized) MOs (NCMOs) and by\nthe commutation equation for the respective one-electron density matrix\n(charge-bond order (CBO)) matrix. Second, perturbative solutions of the\nabove-specified alternative problems are sought in terms of entire submatrices\n(blocks) of the matrix $\\mathbf{H}$\\ instead of usual matrix elements (e.g. of\nCoulomb and resonance parameters). Third, a generalized version of the\nperturbation theory (PT) is used in place of the standard\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"{o}dinger PT (RSPT), wherein non-commutative quantities stand\nfor the usual (commutative) ones (cf. the so-called non-commutative RSPT\n(NCRSPT)). As a result, algebraic expressions are derived for the principal\nquantum-chemical characteristics (including the CBO matrix, the NCMO\nrepresentation matrix and the total energy) that embrace definite classes of\nHamiltonian matrices and thereby of molecules. To illustrate the point,\nsaturated and conjugated hydrocarbons are taken as examples. Arguments are\ngiven that the PNCMO theory possibly forms the basis of a novel way of\nqualitative chemical thinking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 15:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

Over the last years, the MiniBooNE, T2K and MINERvA\ncollaborations have reported a substantial amount of data on\n(anti)neutrino-induced pion production on the nucleus. However, a comprehensive\nand consistent description of the whole data set is still missing. We aim at\nimproving the current understanding of neutrino-induced pion production on the\nnucleus. To this end, the comparison of experimental data with theoretical\npredictions, preferably based on microscopic models, is essential to\ndisentangle the different reaction mechanisms involved in the process. To\ndescribe single-pion production (SPP) we use a hybrid model that combines a\nlow- and a high-energy approach. The low-energy model (LEM) contains resonances\nand background terms. At high invariant masses, a high-energy model based on a\nRegge approach is employed. The model is implemented in the nucleus using the\nrelativistic plane wave impulse approximation (RPWIA). We present a comparison\nof the hybrid-RPWIA and LEM with the recent neutrino-induced charged current\n$1\\pi^+$ production cross section on water reported by T2K. In order to judge\nthe impact of final-state interactions (FSI) we confront our results with those\nof the NuWro Monte Carlo generator.

In many\naggregation methods, the prediction for a new observation x is computed by\nbuilding a linear or convex combination over a collection of basic estimators\nr1(x),. .. , rm(x) previously calibrated using a training data set.\nMojirsheibani proposes to compute the prediction associated to a new\nobservation by combining selected outputs of the training examples.
