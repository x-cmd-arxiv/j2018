The shape gradient gives the local\ndifferential contribution to some scalar figure of merit (shape functional)\ncaused by normal displacement of the shape. In contrast to derivatives with\nrespect to quantities parameterizing a shape (e.g. Fourier amplitudes), which\nhave been used previously for optimizing plasma and coil shapes, the shape\ngradient gives spatially local information and so is more easily related to\nengineering constraints. We present a method to determine the shape gradient\nfor any figure of merit using the parameter derivatives that are already\nroutinely computed for stellarator optimization. Examples of shape gradients\nfor plasma and electromagnetic coil shapes are given. We also derive and\npresent examples of an analogous representation of the local sensitivity to\nmagnetic field errors; this magnetic sensitivity can be rapidly computed from\nthe shape gradient. The shape gradient and magnetic sensitivity can both be\nconverted into local tolerances, which inform how accurately the coils should\nbe built and positioned, where trim coils and structural supports for coils\nshould be placed, and where magnetic material and current leads can best be\nlocated. Both sensitivity measures provide insight into shape optimization,\nenable systematic calculation of tolerances, and connect physics optimization\nto engineering criteria that are more easily specified in real space than in\nFourier space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 16:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

A basic ingredient of the model is a coupling between\nfluctuations of density and velocity gradient via a Herschel-Bulkley-type\nconstitutive model. Focusing on the limit of low shear rates and high\ndensities, the model approximates well---but is not limited to---gently sheared\nhard sphere colloidal glasses, where solvent effects are negligible. A detailed\nanalysis of the linearized hydrodynamic equations for fluctuations and the\nresulting cubic dispersion relation reveals the existence of a range of\ndensities and shear rates with growing flow heterogeneity. In this regime,\nafter an initial transient, the velocity and density fields monotonically reach\na spatially inhomogeneous stationary profile, where regions of high shear rate\nand low density coexist with regions of low shear rate and high density. The\nsteady state is thus maintained by a competition between shear-induced\nenhancement of density inhomogeneities and relaxation via overdamped sound\nwaves. An analysis of the mechanical equilibrium condition provides a criterion\nfor the existence of steady state solutions. The dynamical evolution of the\nsystem is discussed in detail for various boundary conditions, imposing either\na constant velocity, shear rate, or stress at the walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 17:25:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 12:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

Despite years of improvements\nin automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of\nexperienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts\nmay pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake\nlocations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method\ncalled \"PhaseNet\" that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep\nneural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with\nsufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many\napplications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and\ngenerates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals, and noise as\noutput. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in probability provide accurate\narrival times for both P and S waves, and have the potential to increase the\nnumber of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available.\nThis will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity\nmodels. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by\nanalyst-labeled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake\nData Center. The dataset we use contains more than seven million waveform\nsamples extracted from over thirty years of earthquake recordings. We\ndemonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate\nthan existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 17:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

This effect produces bright low-order\nspeckles in the stellar PSF, which severely limit the contrast performance of\nSPHERE under otherwise optimal observing conditions. In this paper we propose\nthe Fast & Furious (F&F) phase diversity algorithm as a viable software-only\nsolution for real-time LWE compensation, which would utilise image sequences\nfrom the SPHERE differential tip-tilt sensor (DTTS). We evaluated the\nclosed-loop performance of F&F on the MITHIC high-contrast test-bench under a\nvariety of conditions emulating LWE-affected DTTS images, in order to assess\nthe expected performance of an on-sky implementation of F&F in SPHERE. The\nalgorithm was found to be capable of returning such LWE-affected images to\nStrehl ratios of greater than 90% within five iterations, for all appropriate\nlaboratory test cases. These results are highly representative of predictive\nsimulations, and demonstrate the stability of the algorithm against a wide\nrange of factors including low image signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), small image\nfield of view, and amplitude errors. It was also found in simulation that\nclosed-loop stability can be preserved down to image S/N as low as five while\nstill improving overall wavefront quality, allowing for reliable operation even\non faint targets. The Fast & Furious algorithm is an extremely promising\nsolution for real-time compensation of the LWE, which can operate\nsimultaneously with science observations and may be implemented in SPHERE\nwithout requiring additional hardware. The robustness and relatively large\neffective dynamic range of F&F also make it suitable for general wavefront\noptimisation applications, including the co-phasing of segmented ELT-class\ntelescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 18:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

In this paper, we thus consider the use of GFDM to allow an\nunlicensed secondary user (SU) to access a spectrum hole. However, in an\nextremely congested spectrum scenario, both active incumbent primary users\n(PUs) on the left and right channels of the spectrum hole will experience OOB\ninterference. While constraining this interference, we thus investigate the\nproblem of power allocation to the SU transmit subcarriers in order to maximize\nthe overall data rate where the SU receiver is employing Matched filter (MF)\nand zero-forcing (ZF) structures. The power allocation problem is thus solved\nas a classic convex optimization problem. Finally, total transmission rate of\nGFDM is compared with that of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM). For instance, when right and left interference temperature should be\nbelow 10 dBm, the capacity gain of GFDM over OFDM is 400 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 20:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-12"}

To\nguarantee the grid reliability and minimize the impacts caused by system status\nfluctuations, a fast, even SCADA-rate, state estimator is urgently needed. In\nthis paper, a graph based power system modeling is firstly explored and a graph\ncomputing based state estimation is proposed to speed up its performance. The\npower system is represented by a graph, which is a collection of vertices and\nedges, and the measurements are attributes of vertices and edges. Each vertex\ncan independently implement local computation, like formulations of the\nnode-based H matrix, gain matrix and righthand-side (RHS) vector, only with the\ninformation on its connected edges and neighboring vertices. Then, by taking\nadvantages of graph database, these node-based data are conveniently collected\nand stored in the compressed sparse row (CSR) format avoiding the complexity\nand heaviness introduced by the sparse matrices. With communications and\nsynchronization, centralized computation of solving the weighted least square\n(WLS) state estimation is completed with hierarchical parallel computing. The\nproposed strategy is implemented on a graph database platform.

In this work, we propose a novel algorithmic kirigami method that\nprovides super compaction of an arbitrary 3D shape with non-negligible surface\nthickness called \"algorithmic stacking\". Our approach computationally finds a\nway of cutting the thick surface of the shape into a strip.

Depending on the surface thickness, the stacked structure takes merely\n0.001% to 6% of the original volume. This super compacted structure not only\ncan be manufactured in a workspace that is significantly smaller than the\nprovided 3D shape, but also makes packing and transportation easier for a\ndeployable application. We further demonstrate that, the proposed stackable\nstructure also provides high pluripotency and can transform into multiple 3D\ntarget shapes if these 3D shapes can be dissected in specific ways and form a\ncommon stacked structure. In contrast to many designs of origami structure that\nusually target at a particular shape, our results provide a universal platform\nfor pluripotent 3D transformable structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 20:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-12"}

An\nedge-colouring is locally $k$-bounded if each vertex is contained in at most\n$k$ edges of the same colour.

One\npopular formulation of such problems is as Bayesian inverse problems, where a\nprior distribution is used to regularize inference on a high-dimensional latent\nstate, typically a function or a field. It is common that such priors are\nnon-Gaussian, for example piecewise-constant or heavy-tailed, and/or\nhierarchical, in the sense of involving a further set of low-dimensional\nparameters, which, for example, control the scale or smoothness of the latent\nstate.

For such systems, order-reduction methods\nthrough projection of the governing equations have limited applicability due to\nthe large intrinsic dimensionality of the underlying attractor but also the\ncomplexity of the transient events. An alternative approach is data-driven\ntechniques that aim to quantify the dynamics of specific modes utilizing\ndata-streams. Several of these approaches have improved performance by\nexpanding the state representation using delayed coordinates. However, such\nstrategies are limited in regions of the phase space where there is a small\namount of data available, as is the case for extreme events.

In particular, we employ the long-short-term memory (LSTM), to\nmodel portions of the dynamics which cannot be accounted by the equations. The\nRNN is trained by analyzing the mismatch between the imperfect model and the\ndata-streams, projected in the reduced-order space. In this way, the\ndata-driven model improves the imperfect model in regions where data is\navailable, while for locations where data is sparse the imperfect model still\nprovides a baseline for the prediction of the system dynamics. We assess the\ndeveloped framework on two challenging prototype systems exhibiting extreme\nevents and show that the blended approach has improved performance compared\nwith methods that use either data streams or the imperfect model alone.

In this paper, we provide the analytic expressions\nfor the coordinates of the orbit for each spacecraft in the\nheliocentric-ecliptic coordinate system to the leading orders. This enables a\nsufficiently accurate study of science objectives and data analysis, and serves\nas a first step to further orbit design and optimization. We calculate the\nresponse of a single Michelson detector to plane gravitational waves in\narbitrary waveform which is valid in the full range of the sensitive\nfrequencies. It is then used to generate the more realistic sensitivity curve\nof TianQin. We apply this model on a reference white-dwarf binary as a proof of\nprinciple.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 03:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Regarding the textual content analysis,\nwe propose a new method for query expansion via locally-trained embedding\nlearning with concept hierarchy as guidance, which is particularly tailored for\nspecific queries with narrow semantic meanings. Compared with global embedding\nlearning, locally-trained embedding learning projects the terms into a latent\nsemantic space constrained on relevant topics, therefore it preserves more\nprecise and subtle information for specific queries. Considering the candidate\nranking, the heterogeneous information network structure, while being largely\nignored in the previous studies of expert finding, provides additional\ninformation.

Because the short-term timing of operation of\nsuch systems is inconsequential as long as their long-run average power\nconsumption is maintained, they are increasingly used in demand response (DR)\nprograms to balance supply and demand on the power grid. Here, we present an\n\\textit{ab initio} phase model for general TCLs, and use the concept to develop\na continuous oscillator model of a TCL and compute its phase response to\nchanges in temperature and applied power. This yields a simple control system\nmodel that can be used to evaluate control policies for modulating the power\nconsumption of aggregated loads with parameter heterogeneity and stochastic\ndrift. We demonstrate this concept by comparing simulations of ensembles of\nheterogeneous loads using the continuous state model and an established hybrid\nstate model. The developed phase model approach is a novel means of evaluating\nDR provision using TCLs, and is instrumental in estimating the capacity of\nancillary services or DR on different time scales. We further propose a novel\nphase response based open-loop control policy that effectively modulates the\naggregate power of a heterogeneous TCL population while maintaining load\ndiversity and minimizing power overshoots. This is demonstrated by low-error\ntracking of a regulation signal by filtering it into frequency bands and using\nTCL sub-ensembles with duty cycles in corresponding ranges. Control policies\nthat can maintain a uniform distribution of power consumption by aggregated\nheterogeneous loads will enable distribution system management (DSM) approaches\nthat maintain stability as well as power quality, and further allow more\nintegration of renewable energy sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 04:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-12"}

Despite its\nprevalence and physical importance in biology, the mechanical properties of\nmolecular collagen are far from established. The flexibility of its triple\nhelix is unresolved, with descriptions from different experimental techniques\nranging from flexible to semirigid. Furthermore, it is unknown how collagen\ntype (homo- vs. heterotrimeric) and source (tissue-derived vs. recombinant)\ninfluence flexibility. Using SmarTrace, a chain tracing algorithm we devised,\nwe performed statistical analysis of collagen conformations collected with\natomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the protein's mechanical properties.\nOur results show that types I, II and III collagens - the key fibrillar\nvarieties - exhibit molecular flexibilities that are very similar. However,\ncollagen conformations are strongly modulated by salt, transitioning from\ncompact to extended as KCl concentration increases, in both neutral and acidic\npH. While analysis with a standard worm-like chain model suggests that the\npersistence length of collagen can attain almost any value within the\nliterature range, closer inspection reveals that this modulation of collagen's\nconformational behavior is not due to changes in flexibility, but rather arises\nfrom the induction of curvature (either intrinsic or induced by interactions\nwith the mica surface). By modifying standard polymer theory to include innate\ncurvature, we show that collagen behaves as an equilibrated curved worm-like\nchain (cWLC) in two dimensions. Analysis within the cWLC model shows that\ncollagen's curvature depends strongly on pH and salt, while its persistence\nlength does not. Thus, we find that triple-helical collagen is well described\nas semiflexible, irrespective of source, type, pH and salt environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 06:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 23:05:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 05:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

It is even more painstaking when the generation is conditioned\non images with drastically different views. This is mainly because\nunderstanding, corresponding, and transforming appearance and semantic\ninformation across the views is not trivial. In this paper, we attempt to solve\nthe novel problem of cross-view image synthesis, aerial to street-view and vice\nversa, using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). Two new\narchitectures called Crossview Fork (X-Fork) and Crossview Sequential (X-Seq)\nare proposed to generate scenes with resolutions of 64x64 and 256x256 pixels.\nX-Fork architecture has a single discriminator and a single generator. The\ngenerator hallucinates both the image and its semantic segmentation in the\ntarget view. X-Seq architecture utilizes two cGANs. The first one generates the\ntarget image which is subsequently fed to the second cGAN for generating its\ncorresponding semantic segmentation map. The feedback from the second cGAN\nhelps the first cGAN generate sharper images. Both of our proposed\narchitectures learn to generate natural images as well as their semantic\nsegmentation maps. The proposed methods show that they are able to capture and\nmaintain the true semantics of objects in source and target views better than\nthe traditional image-to-image translation method which considers only the\nvisual appearance of the scene.

The VAULT2.0 data provide new constraints on\nupper-chromospheric conditions for numerical models. The observing campaign was\nclosely coordinated with the IRIS mission. Taking advantage of this\nsimultaneous multi-wavelength coverage of target AR 12172 and by using\nstate-of-the-art radiative-MHD simulations of spicules, we investigate in\ndetail a type-II spicule associated with a fast (300 km s$^{-1}$) network jet\nrecorded in the campaign observations. Our analysis suggests that spicular\nmaterial exists suspended high in the atmosphere but in lower temperatures\n(seen in Ly$\\alpha$) until it is heated and becomes visible in TR temperatures\nas a network jet. The heating begins lower in the spicule and propagates\nupwards as a rapidly propagating thermal front. The front is then observed as\nfast, plane-of-the-sky motion typical of a network jet, but contained inside\nthe pre-existing spicule. This work supports that the high speeds reported in\nnetwork jets should not be taken as real mass upflows but only as apparent\nspeeds of a rapidly propagating heating front along the pre-existing spicule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 07:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

First, the previously used\npolar-orbiting satellite observations, which can be usually acquired only once\nper day, are hard to monitor PM2.5 in real time. Second, many data gaps exist\nin satellite-derived PM2.5 due to the cloud contamination. In this paper, the\nhourly geostationary satellite (i.e., Himawari-8) observations were adopted for\nthe real-time monitoring of PM2.5 in a deep learning architecture.

Our goal is\nto compare observed and predicted properties of single Galactic O stars to\nidentify and constrain uncertain physical parameters and processes in stellar\nevolution and atmosphere models. We used a sample of 53 objects with spectral\ntypes from O3 to O9.7. For 30 of these, we determined the main photospheric and\nwind parameters, using optical spectroscopy and applying the FASTWIND code. For\nthe remaining objects, literature data, obtained by means of the CMFGEN code,\nwere used instead. The properties of our sample were compared to published\npredictions based on two grids evolution models that include rotationally\ninduced mixing. Within each luminosity class, we find a close correlation of N\nsurface abundance and luminosity, and a stronger N enrichment in more massive\nand evolved O stars. Additionally, a correlation of the surface nitrogen and\nhelium abundances is observed. The large number of nitrogen-enriched stars\nabove ~30 solar masses argues for rotationally induced mixing as the most\nlikely explanation. However, none of the considered models can match the\nobserved trends correctly, especially in the high mass regime. We confirm mass\ndiscrepancy for objects in the low mass O-star regime. We conclude that the\nrotationally induced mixing of helium to the stellar surface is too strong in\nsome of the models. We also suggest that present inadequacies of the models to\nrepresent the N enrichment in more massive stars with relatively slow rotation\nmight be related to problematic efficiencies of rotational mixing.

Due to the high ratio\nbetween its length and width, fractures can be modeled as lower dimensional\ninterfaces embedded in the porous rock. We apply a recently developed embedded\nfinite element method (EFEM) for the Darcy problem. This method allows for\ngeneral fracture geometry, and the fractures may cut the finite element mesh\narbitrarily. We present here a velocity model for EFEM and couple the Darcy\nproblem to a transport problem for a passive solute. The main novelties of this\nwork is a locally conservative velocity approximation derived from the EFEM\nsolution, and the development of a lowest order upwind finite volume method for\nthe transport problem. This numerical model is compatible with EFEM in the\nsense that the same computational mesh may be applied, so that we retain the\nsame flexibility with respect to fracture geometry and meshing. Hence, our\ncoupled solution strategy represents a simple approach in terms of formulation,\nimplementation and meshing. We demonstrate our model by some numerical examples\non both synthetic and realistic problems, including a benchmark study for\nsingle-phase flow.

However,\nbecause evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in\nwhich it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many\nresearchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving\nalgorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized\nbugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes\nuncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal\ncreativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the\nstandard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles\nto be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The\nstories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but\nthat mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and\noutright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only\namong practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how\ninteresting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution\ncan be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published\nbefore.

It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of\nscientifically important and even entertaining stories.

Although the structure of\nGRNs has been the subject of many studies, their large scale structure in the\nlight of feedbacks from the metabolic network (MN) has received relatively\nlittle attention. Here we study the causal structure of the GRNs, namely the\nchain of influence of one component on the other, taking into account feedback\nfrom the MN. First we consider the GRNs of E. coli and B. subtilis without\nfeedback from MN and illustrate their causal structure. Next we augment the\nGRNs with feedback from their respective MNs by including (a) links from genes\ncoding for enzymes to metabolites produced or consumed in reactions catalyzed\nby those enzymes and (b) links from metabolites to genes coding for\ntranscription factors whose transcriptional activity the metabolites alter by\nbinding to them. We find that the inclusion of feedback from MN into GRN\nsignificantly affects its causal structure, in particular the number of levels\nand relative positions of nodes in the hierarchy, and the number and size of\nthe strongly connected components (SCCs). We then study the functional\nsignificance of the SCCs. For this we identify condition specific feedbacks\nfrom the MN into the GRN by retaining only those enzymes that are essential for\ngrowth in specific environmental conditions simulated via the technique of flux\nbalance analysis (FBA). We find that the SCCs of the GRN augmented by these\nfeedbacks can be ascribed specific functional roles in the organism.

In this work, we present a conceptually simple yet\nefficient framework that simultaneously processes the two tasks in one shot.\nOur main contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose a novel text-alignment\nlayer that allows it to precisely compute convolutional features of a text\ninstance in ar- bitrary orientation, which is the key to boost the per-\nformance; 2) a character attention mechanism is introduced by using character\nspatial information as explicit supervision, leading to large improvements in\nrecognition; 3) two technologies, together with a new RNN branch for word\nrecognition, are integrated seamlessly into a single model which is end-to-end\ntrainable. This allows the two tasks to work collaboratively by shar- ing\nconvolutional features, which is critical to identify challenging text\ninstances.

Consider a typical case of a bank hedging a client trade via a\nCCP. On client default the hedge (effects) will be removed (rebalanced). On the\nother hand, if the hedge counterparty defaults the hedge will be replaced. Thus\nif the hedge required initial margin then the default probability driving MVA\nis from the client not from the hedge counterparty. This is the opposite of\nusual assumptions where counterparty XVAs are computed independent of each\nother. Replacement of the hedge counterparty means multiple CVA costs on the\nhedge side need inclusion. Since hedge trades are generally at riskless mid (or\nworse) these costs are paid on the client side, and must be calculated before\nthe replacement hedge counterparties are known. We call these counterparties\nanonymous counterparties. The effects on CVA and MVA will generally be\nexclusive because MVA largely removes CVA, and CVA is hardly relevant for CCPs.\nEffects on KVA and FVA will resemble those on MVA.

This added complexity improves the\npredictive component of MPC resulting in improved margin of inter-vehicle\ndistance during maneuvers like overtaking, lane-change, etc. Although, past\nworks have also incorporated actuator dynamics within MPC, there has been very\nfew attempts towards coupling actuator dynamics to collision avoidance\nconstraints through the non-holonomic motion model of the vehicle and analyzing\nthe resulting behavior.

Established literature values are used\nfor the remaining parameters in the mechanism.

The resulting distribution identifies\nstrong positive and negative correlations and several non-Gaussian\ncharacteristics. Using samples drawn from the posterior, we investigate the\nimpact of parameter uncertainty on the prediction of two more complex flames: a\n2D premixed flame kernel and the ignition of a hydrogen jet issuing into a\nheated chamber.

The so-called fluctuation theorems extended the study of\nfluctuations far beyond equilibrium. All these results rely on the crucial\nassumption that the observer has complete information about the system. Such a\nprecise control is difficult to attain, hence the following questions are\ncompelling: Will an observer who has marginal information be able to perform an\neffective thermodynamic analysis? Given that such observer will only establish\nlocal equilibrium amidst the whirling of hidden degrees of freedom, by\nperturbing the stalling currents will he/she observe equilibrium-like\nfluctuations? We model the dynamics of open systems as Markov jump processes on\nfinite networks. We establish that: 1) While marginal currents do not obey a\nfull-fledged fluctuation relation, there exist effective affinities for which\nan integral fluctuation relation holds; 2) Under reasonable assumptions on the\nparametrization of the rates, effective and \"real\" affinities only differ by a\nconstant; 3) At stalling, i.e. where the marginal currents vanish, a\nsymmetrized fluctuation-dissipation relation holds while reciprocity does not;\n4) There exists a notion of marginal time-reversal that plays a role akin to\nthat played by time-reversal for complete systems, which restores the\nfluctuation relation and reciprocity. The above results hold for\nconfiguration-space currents, and for phenomenological currents provided that\ncertain symmetries of the effective affinities are respected - a condition\nwhose range of validity we deem the most interesting question left open to\nfuture inquiry.

The new approach employs the Bayesian posterior predictive\ndistribution which is the distribution of the future realization of the asset\nreturns given the observable sample. The parameters of the posterior predictive\ndistributions are functions of the observed data values and, consequently, the\nsolution of the optimization problem is expressed in terms of data only and\ndoes not depend on unknown quantities.

The advantages of in silico methodologies are\nbasically the low cost in terms of infrastructures and facilities, the reduced\ninvasiveness and, in general, the intrinsic predictive capabilities based on\nthe use of mathematical models. The disadvantages are generally identified in\nthe distance between the real cases and their virtual counterpart required by\nthe conceptual modeling that can be detrimental for the reliability of\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 02:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

This paper presents an optical module based on SiPMs designed for the\napplication in scintillators as well as lab measurements. The module hosts the\nSiPM bias voltage supply and three pre-amplifiers with different gain levels to\nexploit the full dynamic range of the SiPMs. Two SiPMs, read-out in parallel,\nare equipped with light guides to increase the sensitive area. The light guides\nare optimized for the read-out of wavelength shifting fibers as used in many\nplastic scintillator detectors. The optical and electrical performance of the\nmodule is characterized in detail in laboratory measurements.

This framework contains two\nmain innovations: 1) the technique of image registration is exploited to align\nthe source and target video faces for eliminating the flicker or jitter of the\nsegmented video face sequence; 2) a fast subpixel image registration method is\nproposed for farther accuracy and efficiency. Unlike the priori works, it\nminimizes the overlapping region and takes spatiotemporal coherence into\naccount. Flicker in resulted videos is usually caused by the frequently changed\nbound of the blending target face and unregistered faces between and along\nvideo sequences. The subpixel image registration method is proposed to solve\nthe flicker problem. During the alignment process, integer pixel registration\nis formulated by maximizing the similarity of images with down sampling\nstrategy speeding up the process and sub-pixel image registration is a\nsingle-step image match via analytic method. Experimental results show the\nproposed algorithm reduces the computation time and gets a high accuracy when\nconducting experiments on different data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 06:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}

From these considerations\nseveral issues arise: (i) In general for bundles that are semi-positive but not\nstrictly positive; what further natural conditions lead to the existence of\nsections of its symmetric powers? (ii) In Hodge theory the Hodge metrics\ngenerally have singularities; what can be said about these and their\ncurvatures, Chern forms etc.? (iii) What are some algebro-geometric\napplications of positivity of Hodge bundles? The purpose of these partly\nexpository notes is fourfold. One is to summarize some of the general measures\nand types of positivity that have arisen in the literature. A second is to\nintroduce and give some applications of norm positivity.

Besides the Riemannian line element, also Riemann's residual\nhypotheses of homogeneity and symmetry are dropped. Surprisingly, the\ninfinitesimal Pythagorean distance formula reemerges, without the need of being\npostulated, as a first approximation to $almost$ $every$ geometry that is\ninvariant with respect to direction reversal. More in general, the first\napproximation to $almost$ $every$ geometry is a one-parameter family of\nhomogeneous Riemann-Randers line elements, naturally providing the geometrical\nframework for a unified theory of the classical electromagnetic and\ngravitational fileds. Geometry naturally accounts for the hierarchy between\nelectromagnetic and gravitational interactions, their different\nattractive/repulsive nature, electric charge, CPT symmetry, Maxwell and\nEinstein equations.
