Because interlayer edges can describe relationships\nbetween different modalities, scales, or time points, it is essential to\nunderstand how communities change and evolve across layers.

The essence of the Sixth Problem is discussed and\nthe content of this issue is introduced.\n  In 1900, David Hilbert presented 23 problems for the advancement of\nmathematical science. Hilbert's Sixth Problem proposed the expansion of the\naxiomatic method outside of mathematics, in physics and beyond. Its title was\nshocking: \"Mathematical Treatment of the Axioms of Physics.\" Axioms of physics\ndid not exist and were not expected. During further explanation, Hilbert\nspecified this problem with special focus on probability and \"the limiting\nprocesses, ... which lead from the atomistic view to the laws of motion of\ncontinua\". The programmatic call was formulated \"to treat, by means of axioms,\nthose physical sciences in which already today mathematics plays an important\npart.\" This issue presents a modern slice of the work on the Sixth Problem,\nfrom quantum probability to fluid dynamics and machine learning, and from\nreview of solid mathematical and physical results to opinion pieces with new\nambitious ideas. Some expectations were broken: The continuum limit of\natomistic kinetics may differ from the classical fluid dynamics. The \"curse of\ndimensionality\" in machine learning turns into the \"blessing of dimensionality\"\nthat is closely related to statistical physics. Quantum probability facilitates\nthe modelling of geological uncertainty and hydrocarbon reservoirs. And many\nother findings are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 17:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

Originating from information hiding and\nmultimedia forensics, adversarial classification recently received a lot of\nattention in a broader security context. In the domain of machine\nlearning-based image classification, adversarial classification can be\ninterpreted as detecting so-called adversarial examples, which are slightly\naltered versions of benign images. They are specifically crafted to be\nmisclassified with a very high probability by the classifier under attack.\nNeural networks, which dominate among modern image classifiers, have been shown\nto be especially vulnerable to these adversarial examples.\n  However, detecting subtle changes in digital images has always been the goal\nof multimedia forensics and steganalysis. In this paper, we highlight the\nparallels between these two fields and secure machine learning.\n  Furthermore, we adapt a linear filter, similar to early steganalysis methods,\nto detect adversarial examples that are generated with the projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) method, the state-of-the-art algorithm for this task.

An embedding of a Virtual Network on the shared\nphysical infrastructure is the joint mapping of (virtual) nodes to physical\nservers together with the mapping of (virtual) edges onto paths in the physical\nnetwork connecting the respective servers.\n  This work initiates the study of approximation algorithms for the VNEP.\nConcretely, we study the offline setting with admission control: given multiple\nrequest graphs the task is to embed the most profitable subset while not\nexceeding resource capacities. Our approximation is based on the randomized\nrounding of Linear Programming (LP) solutions.

Large trucks can be used\nto deliver goods to intermediate facilities in accessible locations, whereas\nsmaller vehicles allow to reach the final customers.

Route planning in multi-tier\nlogistics leads to notoriously difficult problems. This difficulty is accrued\nin the presence of an electric fleet, since each vehicle operates on a smaller\nrange, and may require visits to charging stations. To study these challenges,\nwe introduce the Electric Two-echelon Vehicle Routing Problem as a prototypical\nproblem. We propose a large neighbourhood search metaheuristic as well as an\nexact mathematical programming algorithm, which uses decomposition techniques\nto enumerate promising first-level solutions, in conjunction with bounding\nfunctions and route enumeration for the second-level routes.

Nonlinear particle clumping from the SI can trigger\ngravitational collapse into planetesimals. To better understand the numerical\nrobustness of the SI, we perform a suite of vertically-stratified 3D\nsimulations with fixed physical parameters known to produce strong clumping. We\nvary the numerical implementation, namely the computational domain size and the\nvertical boundary conditions (vBCs), comparing newly-implemented outflow vBCs\nto the previously-used periodic and reflecting vBCs. We find strong particle\nclumping by the SI is mostly independent of the vBCs. However, peak particle\ndensities are higher in larger simulation domains due to a larger particle mass\nreservoir. We report SI-triggered zonal flows, i.e., azimuthally-banded radial\nvariations of gas pressure. These structures have low amplitudes, insufficient\nto halt particle radial drift, confirming that particle trapping in gas\npressure maxima is not the mechanism of the SI. We find that outflow vBCs\nproduce artificially large gas outflow rates at vertical boundaries. However,\nthe outflow vBCs reduce artificial reflections at vertical boundaries, allowing\nmore particle sedimentation, and showing less temporal variation and better\nconvergence with box size.

Despite having similar biological developmental\nsteps, pollen grain surface features are remarkably geometrically varied.\nPrevious work suggests that a physical process may drive this pattern formation\nand that the observed diversity of patterns can be explained by viewing pollen\npattern development as a phase transition to a spatially modulated phase.\nSeveral studies have shown that the polysaccharide material of plant cell walls\nundergoes phase separation in the absence of cross-linking stabilizers of the\nmixed phase. Here we show experimental evidence of a change in density of the\nextracellular polysaccharide material (primexine) during pollen cell\ndevelopment leads to a spatially modulated phase. The spatial pattern of this\nphase-separated primexine is also mechanically coupled to the undulation of the\npollen cell membrane. The resulting patterned pools of denser primexine form\nthe negative template of the ultimate sites of sporopollenin deposition,\nleading to the final micropattern observed in the mature pollen. We then\npresent a general physical model of pattern formation via modulated phases.\nUsing analytical and numerical techniques, we find that most of the pollen\nmicropatterns observed in biological evolution could result from a physical\nprocess of modulated phases. However, an analysis of the relative rates of\ntransitions from states that are equilibrated to or from states that are not\nequilibrated suggests that while equilibrium states of this process have\noccurred throughout evolutionary history, there has been no particular\nevolutionary selection for distinctly patterned equilibrated states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 18:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

It is known that\nDisconnected Cut is NP-hard on general graphs, while polynomial-time algorithms\nare known for several graph classes.

While some galaxies do display radial\ngradients in their ellipticity (${\\epsilon}$) and/or their Fourier\ncoefficients, differences in mean values between adjacent regions are not\nstatistically significant. Regarding Fourier coefficients, dwarf galaxies\nusually display gradients between all adjacent regions, while non-dwarfs tend\nto show this behaviour just between the two outermost regions. Globally, there\nis no obvious correlation between Fourier coefficients and luminosity for the\nwhole magnitude range ($-12 {\\gtrsim} M_{V} {\\gtrsim} -22$); however, dwarfs\ndisplay much higher dispersions at all radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 20:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

These\ncommunities can interact with one another, often leading to conflicts and toxic\ninteractions. However, little is known about the mechanisms of interactions\nbetween communities and how they impact users.\n  Here we study intercommunity interactions across 36,000 communities on\nReddit, examining cases where users of one community are mobilized by negative\nsentiment to comment in another community. We show that such conflicts tend to\nbe initiated by a handful of communities---less than 1% of communities start\n74% of conflicts. While conflicts tend to be initiated by highly active\ncommunity members, they are carried out by significantly less active members.\nWe find that conflicts are marked by formation of echo chambers, where users\nprimarily talk to other users from their own community. In the long-term,\nconflicts have adverse effects and reduce the overall activity of users in the\ntargeted communities.\n  Our analysis of user interactions also suggests strategies for mitigating the\nnegative impact of conflicts---such as increasing direct engagement between\nattackers and defenders. Further, we accurately predict whether a conflict will\noccur by creating a novel LSTM model that combines graph embeddings, user,\ncommunity, and text features. This model can be used toreate early-warning\nsystems for community moderators to prevent conflicts. Altogether, this work\npresents a data-driven view of community interactions and conflict, and paves\nthe way towards healthier online communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 21:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

High mechanical quality factors\n($Q$) exhibited by the mm-sized quartz resonators make them ideal for studying\nweak couplings or long timescales in the quantum regime. However, energy losses\nthrough mechanical supports pose a serious limiting factor for obtaining high\nquality factors. Here we investigate how the $Q$ of quartz resonators at deep\ncryogenic temperatures can be limited by several types of losses related to\nanchoring. We first introduce means to reduce the mechanical losses by more\nthan an order of magnitude in a no-clamping scheme, obtaining $Q$-factors of\n$10^8$ of the lowest shear mode. We can exclude a wide coverage of aluminum\nmetallization on the disk or bond wires as sources of dissipation.

We propose a circuit model that accounts for the reduced mechanical\n$Q$-factor in terms of electrical losses.

In these systems, the\nfractal dimension is considered a non-thermal order parameter, commonly and\nequivalently computed from the scaling of the two-point radial- or\nangular-density correlations. However, these two quantities lead to\ndiscrepancies during the analysis of basic systems, such as in the\ndiffusion-limited aggregation fractal. Hence, the corresponding clarification\nregarding the limits of the radial/angular scaling equivalence is needed. In\nthis work, considering three fundamental fractal/non-fractal transitions in two\ndimensions, we show that the unavoidable emergence of growth anisotropies is\nresponsible for the breaking-down of the radial/angular equivalence.\nSpecifically, we show that the angular scaling behaves as a critical power-law,\nwhereas the radial scaling as an exponential that, under the fractal dimension\ninterpretation, resemble first- and second-order transitions, respectively.\nRemarkably, these and previous results can be unified under a single fractal\ndimensionality equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2018 22:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 04:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

In this\ninvestigation of high-$Ra$ porous media convection in a minimal flow unit, two\nreduced modeling strategies are proposed that exploit these specific flow\ncharacteristics. Both approaches utilize the idea of decomposition since the\nflow exhibits different dynamics in different regions of the domain:\nsmall-scale cellular motions generally are localized within the thermal and\nvorticity boundary layers near the upper and lower walls, while in the\ninterior, the flow exhibits persistent large-scale structures and only a few\nlow (horizontal) wavenumber Fourier modes are active. Accordingly, in the first\nstrategy, the domain is decomposed into two near-wall regions and one interior\nregion. Our results confirm that suppressing the interior high-wavenumber modes\nhas negligible impact on the essential structural features and transport\nproperties of the flow. In the second strategy, a hybrid reduced model is\nconstructed by using Galerkin projection onto a fully \\emph{a priori}\neigenbasis drawn from energy stability and upper bound theory, thereby\nextending the model reduction strategy developed by Chini \\emph{et al.}\n(\\emph{Physica~D}, vol. 240, 2011, pp. 241--248) to large $Ra$.

It is\nthus critical to reveal and understand the charge transfer effects in VDWHs,\nfor which electronic structure measurements have proven to be effective. Using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we studied the electronic structures\nof (PbSe)1.16(TiSe2)m(m=1, 2), which are naturally occurring VDWHs, and\ndiscovered several striking charge transfer effects. When the thickness of the\nTiSe2 layers is halved from m=2 to m=1, the amount of charge transferred\nincreases unexpectedly by more than 250%. This is accompanied by a dramatic\ndrop in the electron-phonon interaction strength far beyond the prediction by\nfirst-principles calculations and, consequently, superconductivity only exists\nin the m=2 compound with strong electron-phonon interaction, albeit with lower\ncarrier density. Furthermore, we found that the amount of charge transferred in\nboth compounds is nearly halved when warmed from below 10 K to room\ntemperature, due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of the\nconstituent layers of these misfit compounds. These unprecedentedly large\ncharge transfer effects might widely exist in VDWHs composed of\nmetal-semiconductor contacts; thus, our results provide important insights for\nfurther understanding and applications of VDWHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 03:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

To date, we have a superficial notion of\nhabitability, a necessary first step, but so far lacking an understanding of\nthe detailed interaction between stars and planets over geological timescales,\ndynamical evolution of planetary systems, and atmospheric evolution on planets\nin other systems. A planet mass, net insolation, and atmospheric composition\nalone are insufficient to determine the probability that life on a planet could\narise or be detected. The latter set of planetary considerations, among others,\nunderpin the concept of the habitable zone (HZ), defined as the circumstellar\nregion where standing bodies of liquid water could be supported on the surface\nof a rocky planet. However, stars within the same spectral class are often\ntreated in the same way in HZ studies, without any regard for variations in\nactivity among individual stars. Such formulations ignore differences in how\nnonthermal emission and magnetic energy of transient events in different stars\naffect the ability of an exoplanet to retain its atmosphere.In the last few\nyears there has been a growing appreciation that the atmospheric chemistry, and\neven retention of an atmosphere in many cases, depends critically on the\nhigh-energy radiation and particle environments around these stars. Indeed,\nrecent studies have shown stellar activity and the extreme space weather, such\nas that created by the frequent flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from\nthe active stars and young Sun, may have profoundly affected the chemistry and\nclimate and thus habitability of the early Earth and terrestrial type\nexoplanets.

In the past few decades, the fascinating surface patterns have been\nstudied extensively by using the linear bifurcation analysis under plane\nstrain. The bifurcation concerns the non-uniqueness solutions, however, it\ndelivers little information about the surface instability before and after the\nthreshold. In this paper, we study surface wrinkling of a finite elastic block\nof general elastic materials subject to biaxial loading by an energy method.\nThe first and second variations of the strain energy functional are\nsystematically studied, and an eigenvalue problem is proposed whether the\nsecond variation is positive definite. We illustrate our analysis by using\nneo-Hookean materials as an example. Accordingly, we show that the initially\nflat state has the lowest energy and is stable before the stretches reach the\nthreshold at which the surface wrinkling occurs. We also find that the\nthreshold is independent of the size of the block and coincides with that of\nthe surface instability of an elastic half-space studied by Biot (1963) with\nthe linear bifurcation analysis. However, the stability region cannot be\nobtained by using the linear stability analysis. In contrast to the\nsize-independent threshold, the wavelength of surface wrinkling depends on the\nsize of the block. We first show that a two-dimensional rather than a\nthree-dimensional perturbation has lower energy and is more likely to trigger\nthe surface wrinkling in the instability region. The same stretch threshold of\na finite block and a half-space could shed light on the relation of surface\ninstabilities between finite and infinite bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 05:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

A particular\ndifficulty is how to fairly capture the notion of \"predicting an unqueried\nvalue\" when the adversary can query in quantum superposition.\n  We propose a natural definition of unforgeability against quantum adversaries\ncalled blind unforgeability. This notion defines a function to be predictable\nif there exists an adversary who can use \"partially blinded\" oracle access to\npredict values in the blinded region. We support the proposal with a number of\ntechnical results. We begin by establishing that the notion coincides with\nEUF-CMA in the classical setting and go on to demonstrate that the notion is\nsatisfied by a number of simple guiding examples, such as random functions and\nquantum-query-secure pseudorandom functions. We then show the suitability of\nblind unforgeability for supporting canonical constructions and reductions. We\nprove that the \"hash-and-MAC\" paradigm and the Lamport one-time digital\nsignature scheme are indeed unforgeable according to the definition. To support\nour analysis, we additionally define and study a new variety of quantum-secure\nhash functions called Bernoulli-preserving.\n  Finally, we demonstrate that blind unforgeability is stronger than a previous\ndefinition of Boneh and Zhandry [EUROCRYPT '13, CRYPTO '13] in the sense that\nwe can construct an explicit function family which is forgeable by an attack\nthat is recognized by blind-unforgeability, yet satisfies the definition by\nBoneh and Zhandry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 05:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 21:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 07:03:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 09:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

The generalization aims at\nderiving fast learning rate for deep nets. It usually requires small capacity\nto reduce the variance. Different from previous studies on deep learning,\npursuing either expressivity or generalization, we take both factors into\naccount to explore the theoretical advantages of deep nets.

However, we identified a critical width $N_c = 10$ for\nwhich this symmetry breaks spontaneously. It defines a dimensional transition\nfrom one-dimension (1D) including quasi-1D to 2D. The finite-size effect\ndiffers from that of the $N$-by-$N$ lattice.

To model\nthe tradeoff relationship between energy consumption and end-to-end file\ndelivery delay, a utility function linearly combining these two metrics is used\nas an objective function of the optimization problem.

It is possible to view task constrained motion planning as an\noptimization problem with non-linear equality constraints which can be solved\nby general non-linear optimization techniques. In this paper, we present a\nnovel custom optimizer which exploits the underlying structure present in many\ntask constraints.\n  At the core of our approach are some simple reformulations, which when\ncoupled with the \\emph{method of alternating projection}, leads to an efficient\nconvex optimization based routine for computing a feasible solution to the task\nconstraints. We subsequently build on this result and use the concept of\nAugmented Lagrangian to guide the feasible solutions towards those which also\nminimize the user defined cost function. We show that the proposed optimizer is\nfully distributive and thus, can be easily parallelized. We validate our\nformulation on some common robotic benchmark problems. In particular, we show\nthat the proposed optimizer achieves cyclic motion in the joint space\ncorresponding to a similar nature trajectory in the task space. Furthermore, as\na baseline, we compare the proposed optimizer with an off-the-shelf non-linear\nsolver provide in open source package SciPy.

Mechanisms underlying nerve damage and sensory loss following\nmetabolic dysfunction remain large unclear. Recently, hyperglycemia-induced\nmitochondrial dysfunction and the generation of ROS have gained attention as\npossible mechanisms of organ damage in diabetes. Hypoxia-inducible factor\n1(HIF1a) is a key transcription factor activated by hypoxia, hyperglycemia,\nnitric oxide as well as ROS, suggesting a fundamental role in DPN\nsusceptibility. Genetically-modified mutant mice, which conditionally lack\nHIF1a in peripheral sensory neurons (SNS-HIF1a-/-), were analyzed\nlongitudinally up to 6 months in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type1\ndiabetes. Behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical\nstimuli, quantitative morphological analyses of intraepidermal nerve fiber\ndensity and measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sensory neurons in\nvivo were undertaken over several months post-STZ injections to delineate the\nrole of HIF1a in DPN. Longitudinal behavioral and morphological analyses at 5,\n13 and 24 wks post-STZ treatment revealed that SNS-HIF1a-/- developed stronger\nhyperglycemia-evoked losses of peripheral nociceptive sensory axons associated\nwith stronger losses of mechano- and heat sensation with a faster onset than\nHIF1afl/fl mice. Mechanistically, these histomorphologic and behavioral\ndifferences were associated with significantly higher level of STZ-induced\nproduction of ROS in sensory neurons of SNS-HIF1a-/- mice as compared with\nHIF1afl/fl. Our results indicate that HIF1a is as an upstream modulator of ROS\nin peripheral sensory neurons and exerts a protective function in suppressing\nhyperglycemia-induced nerve damage by limiting ROS levels. HIF1a stabilization\nmay be thus a new strategy target for limiting sensory loss, a debilitating\nlate complication of diabetes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 11:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

There are three reasons for that. (i) Previous studies\ndid not focus on the appropriate density interval. (ii) For the density to be a\nmeaningful variable the population must be distributed as uniformly as\npossible. If an area has towns and cities where a majority of the population is\nconcentrated its average density is meaningless. (iii) In the propagation of an\nepidemic the initial proportion of susceptibles (that is to say persons who\nhave not developed an immunity) is an essential, yet usually unknown, factor.\nThe assumption that most of the population is susceptible holds only for new\nstrain of diseases.\n  It will be shown that when these requirements are taken care of, the size of\nepidemics is indeed closely connected with the population density. This\nempirical observation comes as a welcome confirmation of the classical KMK\n(Kermack-McKendrick 1927) model. Indeed, one of its key predictions is that the\nsize of the epidemic increases strongly (and in a non linear way) with the\ninitial density of susceptibles.\n  An interesting consequence is that, contrary to common beliefs, in sparsely\npopulated territories, like Alaska, Australia or the west coast of the United\nstates the size of epidemics among native populations must have been limited by\nthe low density even for diseases for which the natives had no immunity (i.e.,\nwere susceptibles).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 14:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Two types of\nheterojunctions in the forms of WS$_2$/MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ (type-A) and\nMoS$_2$/WS$_2$/MoS$_2$ (type-B) with incident electrons in MoS$_2$ region are\nconsidered in which the lateral shift of electrons is induced by band\nalignments of the two constituent semiconductors. It is shown that the type-A\nheterojunction can act as an electron waveguide due to electron confinement\nbetween the two WS$_2$/MoS$_2$ interfaces which cause the incident electrons\nwith an appropriate incidence angle to propagate along the interfaces. In this\ncase the spin- and valley-dependent GH shifts of totally reflected electrons\nfrom the interface lead to separated electrons with distinct spin-valley\nindexes after traveling a sufficiently long distance. In type-B heterojunction,\nhowever, transmission resonances occur for incident electron beams passing\nthrough the structure, and large spin- and valley-dependent lateral shift\nvalues in propagating states can be achieved. Consequently, the transmitted\nelectrons are spatially well-separated into electrons with distinct spin-valley\nindexes.

However, even simple automata components can lead to collective\ndynamics that are computationally intractable when aggregated into networks.

The precise charting\nand measurement of such canalization simplifies these models, making even very\nlarge networks amenable to analysis.

The presented analysis considers the impact of the\nenergy constraint on users' preferences and the BS's revenue. In order to model\nthe competitive nature of the problem, game theory is used. The next two\nchapters focus on wireless powered networks (WPNs) and simultaneous wireless\ninformation and power transfer (SWIPT) using radio frequency (RF) technology.\nOne of the main contributions of these chapters is the introduction of both\nuplink and downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for WPNs. Moreover,\nthe individual data rates and fairness are improved, while the formulated\nproblems are optimally and efficiently solved. It is shown that, compared to\northogonal multiple access, NOMA offers a considerable improvement in\nthroughput, fairness, and energy efficiency. Rather than this, proportional\nfairness is maximized and uplink/downlink of WPNs are jointly optimized, in\nwhich cases, except for NOMA, time division multiple access (TDMA) is also\ninvestigated. Furthermore, the role of interference is considered, which has\nbeen recognized as one of the main reasons of the asymmetric overall\ndegradation of the users' performance, due to different path-loss values,\ncalled from now on as cascaded near-far problem.

Conventional coloring schemes\nare based on assignment of one color to each region or equivalently each link\nis member of just one partial topology. These algorithms based on coloring are\nnot optimal when links are not activated with the same rate. Soft coloring,\nintroduced in this paper, solves this problem and provide optimal solution for\nany requested link usage rate. To define the game model for optimum scheduling,\nfirst all possible components of the graph are identified. Components are\ndefined as sets of the wireless links can be activated simultaneously without\nsuffering from mutual interference. Then by switching between components with\nappropriate frequencies (usage rate) optimum scheduling is achieved. We call\nthis kind of scheduling as soft coloring because any links can be member of\nmore than one partial topology, in different time segments. To simplify this\nproblem, we model relationship between link rates and components selection\nfrequencies by a matrix game which provides a simple and helpful tool to\nsimplify and solve the problem.

Recent works take advantage of highly parallel\nanalog in-situ computation in memristor crossbars to accelerate the many\nvector-matrix multiplication operations in CNNs. However, these in-situ\naccelerators have two significant short-comings that we address in this work.\nFirst, the ADCs account for a large fraction of chip power and area. Second,\nthese accelerators adopt a homogeneous design where every resource is\nprovisioned for the worst case. By addressing both problems, the new\narchitecture, Newton, moves closer to achieving optimal energy-per-neuron for\ncrossbar accelerators.\n  We introduce multiple new techniques that apply at different levels of the\ntile hierarchy.

Finally, we place constraints on how a\nworkload is mapped to tiles, thus helping reduce resource provisioning in\ntiles.
