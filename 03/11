For microscopic scenarios, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is\nincreasingly used as an imaging modality. OCT is suitable for accurate pose\nestimation due to its micrometer range resolution and volumetric field of view.\nHowever, OCT image processing is challenging due to speckle noise and\nreflection artifacts in addition to the images' 3D nature. We address pose\nestimation from OCT volume data with a new deep learning-based tracking\nframework. For this purpose, we design a new 3D convolutional neural network\n(CNN) architecture to directly predict the 6D pose of a small marker geometry\nfrom OCT volumes. We use a hexapod robot to automatically acquire labeled data\npoints which we use to train 3D CNN architectures for multi-output regression.\nWe use this setup to provide an in-depth analysis on deep learning-based pose\nestimation from volumes. Specifically, we demonstrate that exploiting volume\ninformation for pose estimation yields higher accuracy than relying on 2D\nrepresentations with depth information. Supporting this observation, we provide\nquantitative and qualitative results that 3D CNNs effectively exploit the depth\nstructure of marker objects. Regarding the deep learning aspect, we present\nefficient design principles for 3D CNNs, making use of insights from the 2D\ndeep learning community.

The ion temperature and field-aligned bulk\nflow velocity are derived from 2-D ion velocity distribution functions measured\nby the suprathermal electron imager (SEI) instrument.

The amount of ion heating cannot be explained by\nfrictional heating, and the correlation of ion heating with BBELF waves suggest\nthat significant wave-ion heating is occurring and even dominating at altitudes\nas low as 350 km, a boundary that is lower than previously reported.\nSurprisingly, the majority of these heating events (17 out 24) are associated\nwith core ion downflows rather than upflows.

The proposed algorithm\nprovides a good identification performance with low sensitivity to impairments\nin the received signal, such as phase noise, timing offset, and channel\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2018 01:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

In weakly supervised scenario, mapping between\nimage regions (i.e., proposals) and language is not available in the training\nset. Previous methods address this deficiency by training a grounding system\nvia learning to reconstruct language information contained in input queries\nfrom predicted proposals. However, the optimization is solely guided by the\nreconstruction loss from the language modality, and ignores rich visual\ninformation contained in proposals and useful cues from external knowledge. In\nthis paper, we explore the consistency contained in both visual and language\nmodalities, and leverage complementary external knowledge to facilitate weakly\nsupervised grounding. We propose a novel Knowledge Aided Consistency Network\n(KAC Net) which is optimized by reconstructing input query and proposal's\ninformation. To leverage complementary knowledge contained in the visual\nfeatures, we introduce a Knowledge Based Pooling (KBP) gate to focus on\nquery-related proposals.

As the characteristic widths of the kernel smoother increase, the\nbias from temporal and frequency averaging increases while the variance\ndecreases. The demodulation parameters, such as the order, length, and\nbandwidth of spectral taper and the kernel smoother, are determined by\nminimizing the expected error. For well-resolved evolutionary spectra, the\noptimal taper length is a small fraction of the optimal kernel half-width.

First, we provide a\nBayesian approach to the filament estimation in regression context and study\nthe posterior contraction rates using a finite random series of B-splines\nbasis.

Within this increasing complexity, developers,\nmaintainers, and users cannot keep track of the interactions between all the\nvarious configuration options. Finding the optimally performing configuration\nof a software system for a given setting is challenging. Recent approaches\naddress this challenge by learning performance models based on a sample set of\nconfigurations. However, collecting enough data on enough sample configurations\ncan be very expensive since each such sample requires configuring, compiling\nand executing the entire system against a complex test suite. The central\ninsight of this paper is that choosing a suitable source (a.k.a. \"bellwether\")\nto learn from, plus a simple transfer learning scheme will often outperform\nmuch more complex transfer learning methods. Using this insight, this paper\nproposes BEETLE, a novel bellwether based transfer learning scheme, which can\nidentify a suitable source and use it to find near-optimal configurations of a\nsoftware system. BEETLE significantly reduces the cost (in terms of the number\nof measurements of sample configuration) to build performance models. We\nevaluate our approach with 61 scenarios based on 5 software systems and\ndemonstrate that BEETLE is beneficial in all cases. This approach offers a new\nhighwater mark in configuring software systems.

The ability to\nquantify noise is crucial for these applications, e.g., when the sensor is used\nfor map generation or to develop a sensor scheduling policy in a multi-sensor\nsetup. Range error models provide uncertainty estimates and help weigh the data\ncorrectly in instances where range measurements are taken from different\nvantage points or with different sensors. The weighing is important to fuse\nrange data into a map in a meaningful way, i.e., the high confidence data is\nrelied on most heavily. Such a model is derived in this work. We show that the\nrange error for stereo systems with integrated illuminators is cubic and\nvalidate the proposed model experimentally with an off-the-shelf structured\nlight stereo system. The experiments confirm the validity of the model and\nsimplify the application of this type of sensor in robotics. The proposed error\nmodel is relevant to any stereo system with low ambient light where the main\nlight source is located at the camera system. Among others, this is the case\nfor structured light stereo systems and night stereo systems with headlights.\nIn this work, we propose that the range error is cubic in range for stereo\nsystems with integrated illuminators.

The calibration of the local volatility function is usually\ntime-consuming because of the multi-dimensional nature of the problem. In this\npaper, we develop a calibration technique based on a partial differential\nequation (PDE) approach which allows an efficient implementation. The essential\nidea is based on solving the derived forward equation satisfied by P(t; S;\nr)Z(t; S; r), where P(t; S; r) represents the risk neutral probability density\nof (S(t); r(t)) and Z(t; S; r) the projection of the stochastic discounting\nfactor in the state variables (S(t); r(t)).

Vessel\nsegmentation in fundus images is a challenging task due to complex vessel\nstructure, the presence of similar structures such as microaneurysms and\nhemorrhages, micro-vessel with only one to several pixels wide, and\nrequirements for finer results. Methods:In this paper, we present a multi-scale\ndeeply supervised network with short connections (BTS-DSN) for vessel\nsegmentation. We used short connections to transfer semantic information\nbetween side-output layers. Bottom-top short connections pass low level\nsemantic information to high level for refining results in high-level\nside-outputs, and top-bottom short connection passes much structural\ninformation to low level for reducing noises in low-level side-outputs. In\naddition, we employ cross-training to show that our model is suitable for real\nworld fundus images. Results: The proposed BTS-DSN has been verified on DRIVE,\nSTARE and CHASE_DB1 datasets, and showed competitive performance over other\nstate-of-the-art methods.

However, practical IDSs generally update\ntheir decision module by feeding new data then retraining learning models in a\nperiodical way. Hence, some attacks that comprise the data for training or\ntesting classifiers significantly challenge the detecting capability of machine\nlearning-based IDSs. Poisoning attack, which is one of the most recognized\nsecurity threats towards machine learning-based IDSs, injects some adversarial\nsamples into the training phase, inducing data drifting of training data and a\nsignificant performance decrease of target IDSs over testing data. In this\npaper, we adopt the Edge Pattern Detection (EPD) algorithm to design a novel\npoisoning method that attack against several machine learning algorithms used\nin IDSs. Specifically, we propose a boundary pattern detection algorithm to\nefficiently generate the points that are near to abnormal data but considered\nto be normal ones by current classifiers. Then, we introduce a Batch-EPD\nBoundary Pattern (BEBP) detection algorithm to overcome the limitation of the\nnumber of edge pattern points generated by EPD and to obtain more useful\nadversarial samples. Based on BEBP, we further present a moderate but effective\npoisoning method called chronic poisoning attack.

Loose, less evolved groups of galaxies likely\nnot virialized yet may lack a well defined RS. This is actually explained in\nthe framework of galaxy evolution. We are focussing on understanding galaxy\nmigration towards the RS, checking for signatures of such a transition in their\nphotometric and morphological properties. We report on the UV properties of a\nsample of ETGs galaxies inhabiting the RS. The analysis of their structures, as\nderived by fitting a Sersic law to their UV luminosity profiles, suggests the\npresence of an underlying disk. This is the hallmark of dissipation processes\nthat still must have a role in the evolution of this class of galaxies. SPH\nsimulations with chemo-photometric implementations able to match the global\nproperties of our targets are used to derive their evolutionary paths through\nUV-optical CDM, providing some fundamental information such as the crossing\ntime through the GV, which depends on their luminosity. The transition from the\nBC to the RS takes several Gyrs, being about 3-5 Gyr for the the brightest\ngalaxies and more long for fainter ones, if it occurs. The photometric study of\nnearby galaxy structures in UV is seriously hampered by either the limited FoV\nof the cameras (e.g in HST) or by the low spatial resolution of the images (e.g\nin the GALEX). Current missions equipped with telescopes and cameras sensitive\nto UV wavelengths, such as Swift-UVOT and Astrosat-UVIT, provide a relatively\nlarge FoV and better resolution than the GALEX. More powerful UV instruments\n(size, resolution and FoV) are obviously bound to yield fundamental advances in\nthe accuracy and depth of the surface photometry and in the characterisation of\nthe galaxy environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2018 14:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

In this framework, we establish a lower bound on the one-shot EA\nprivate capacity. When there exists a quantum channel mapping the state of the\ndecoding set to the state of the malicious set, such a broadcast channel is\nsaid to be degraded. We establish an upper bound on the one-shot EA private\ncapacity in terms of smoothed min- and max-entropies for such channels.

This study reports the changes in the\ngeometry and dynamics of FG nanobeams because of changes in their surface\ntextures and/or surface mechanical properties. A new model for FG nanobeams\nwith engineering surfaces is developed. This engineering surface is considered\nas a different material phase with a surface texture (waviness and roughness).\nThe initial curvatures of cantilever, simple supported, and clamped-clamped FG\nnanobeams due to surface residual stresses are determined. Moreover, their\nnatural frequencies and mode shapes are derived depending on surface integrity.\nThe initial curvatures of FG beams are obtained increasing with an increase in\nthe slope of the surface texture and/or a decrease in the heights of the\nsurface roughness. Moreover, it is observed that the natural frequencies of FG\nbeams may decrease or increase due surface integrity depending on the boundary\nconditions. Thus, as a first prospect, the surface roughness allows the\nvibration energy to propagation over the beam length and hence its natural\nfrequency decreases resulting in a zero-frequency mode. As for the other\nprospect, surface roughness inhibits the propagation of the vibration energy\nthrough the beam length leading to a mode localization. It is revealed that a\nmode localization is accompanied with an increase in the natural frequency of\nthe nanobeam. The proposed surface integrity model for FG nanobeams is compared\nwith Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity model. The results demonstrate that the\nsurface integrity model is preferred over the former model where it accounts\nfor, both, surface texture and surface mechanical properties effects. However,\nGurtin-Murdoch model assumes smooth surfaces of nanobeams which leads to\nunder/overestimations of their mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2018 02:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

This has\npractical consequences which have not yet been explored in full generality, nor\nsystematically exploited by network practitioners. Here we study the effect of\nnetwork symmetry on arbitrary network measures, and show how this can be\nexploited in practice in a number of ways, from redundancy compression, to\ncomputational reduction. We also uncover the spectral signatures of symmetry\nfor an arbitrary network measure such as the graph Laplacian. Computing network\nsymmetries is very efficient in practice, and we test real-world examples up to\nseveral million nodes. Since network models are ubiquitous in the Applied\nSciences, and typically contain a large degree of structural redundancy, our\nresults are not only significant, but widely applicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 23:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 15:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 13:20:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 09:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}
