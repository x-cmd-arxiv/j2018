Modes of Google's Rappor randomizer as\nwell as applications of two well-known classical randomized response methods,\nWarner's original method and Simmons' unrelated question method, belong to this\nfamily. We show that randomizers in this family transform multinomial\ndistribution parameters by an iterated Kronecker product of an invertible and\nbisymmetric $2 \\times 2$ matrix. This allows us to present a simple and\nefficient algorithm for obtaining unbiased maximum likelihood parameter\nestimates for $k$-way marginals from randomized responses and provide\ntheoretical bounds on the statistical efficiency achieved.

As a\nconsequence, a comprehensive study of the effects of irradiation-induced\nhardening mechanisms on void growth and coalescence in irradiated materials is\nrequired. The effects of irradiation on ductile fracture mechanisms - void\ngrowth to coalescence - are assessed in this study based on model experiments.\nPure copper thin tensile samples have been irradiated with protons up to 0.01\ndpa. Micron-scale holes drilled through the thickness of these samples\nsubjected to uniaxial loading conditions allow a detailed description of void\ngrowth and coalescence.

This problem extends the classical contextual bandit\nproblem with similarity information by introducing multiple and possibly\nconflicting objectives. Since the best arm in each objective can be different\ngiven the context, learning the best arm based on a single objective can\njeopardize the rewards obtained from the other objectives. In order to evaluate\nthe performance of the learner in this setup, we use a performance metric\ncalled the contextual Pareto regret. Essentially, the contextual Pareto regret\nis the sum of the distances of the arms chosen by the learner to the context\ndependent Pareto front. For this problem, we develop a new online learning\nalgorithm called Pareto Contextual Zooming (PCZ), which exploits the idea of\ncontextual zooming to learn the arms that are close to the Pareto front for\neach observed context by adaptively partitioning the joint context-arm set\naccording to the observed rewards and locations of the context-arm pairs\nselected in the past.

Despite the\nimportance of the problem, there has been no formal assessment of how errors in\nentity resolution impact learning.\n  In this paper, we provide a thorough answer to this question, answering how\noptimal classifiers, empirical losses, margins and generalisation abilities are\naffected. While our answer spans a wide set of losses --- going beyond proper,\nconvex, or classification calibrated ---, it brings simple practical arguments\nto upgrade entity resolution as a preprocessing step to learning. One of these\nsuggests that entity resolution should be aimed at controlling or minimizing\nthe number of matching errors between examples of distinct classes. In our\nexperiments, we modify a simple token-based entity resolution algorithm so that\nit indeed aims at avoiding matching rows belonging to different classes, and\nperform experiments in the setting where entity resolution relies on noisy\ndata, which is very relevant to real world domains. Notably, our approach\ncovers the case where one peer \\textit{does not} have classes, or a noisy\nrecord of classes. Experiments display that using the class information during\nentity resolution can buy significant uplift for learning at little expense\nfrom the complexity standpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2018 20:53:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 21:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

These stars are located on\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram relative to the isochrones with a high\naccuracy. This has allowed me to conclude that the reddening and extinction\nwere significantly underestimated in some kinematic studies of other authors.\nThe median accuracy of the velocity components U, V, W in this study is 1.7\nkm/s, although outside the range $-0.1<(B_T-V_T)_0<0.5$ the kinematic\ncharacteristics are noticeably biased due to the incompleteness of the sample.\nWe have confirmed the variations in the mean velocity of stars relative to the\nSun and the stellar velocity dispersion as a function of their dereddened color\nknown from the Hipparcos data. Given the age estimates for the stars under\nconsideration from the TRILEGAL model and the Geneva-Copenhagen survey, these\nvariations may be considered as variations as a function of the age. A\ncomparison of our results with the results of other studies of the stellar\nkinematics near the Sun has shown that selection and reddening underestimation\nexplain almost completely the discrepancies between the results.

Such a localized electronic\nstate carries an effective total angular momentum of $J_{eff}=1/2$.

However, this relativistic electron picture is challenged by an\nalternate description, in which itinerant electrons are confined to a\nbenzene-like hexagon, keeping the system insulating despite the delocalized\nnature of the electrons. In this quasi-molecular orbital (QMO) picture, the\nhoneycomb iridates are an unlikely choice for a Kitaev spin liquid.

The ocean environment is dynamic and oftentimes the ocean\nwaves result in strong disturbances that can disturb the vehicle's motion.\nModeling such dynamic environment is non-trivial, and integrating such model in\nthe robotic motion control is particularly difficult. Fortunately, the ocean\ncurrents usually form some local patterns (e.g. vortex) and thus the\nenvironment is partially structured. The historically observed data can be used\nto train the robot to learn to interact with the ocean tidal disturbances. In\nthis paper we propose a method that applies the deep reinforcement learning\nframework to learn such partially structured complex disturbances.

When the distance between Alice and Bob becomes\nlarge compared to the distance between Alice and Willie(s), the performance of\ncovert communication will be degraded. In this case, multi-hop message\ntransmission via intermediate relays can help to improve performance. Hence, in\nthis work multi-hop covert communication over a moderate size network and in\nthe presence of multiple collaborating Willies is considered. The relays can\ntransmit covertly using either a single key for all relays, or different\nindependent keys at the relays. For each case, we develop efficient algorithms\nto find optimal paths with maximum throughput and minimum end-to-end delay\nbetween Alice and Bob. As expected, employing multiple hops significantly\nimproves the ability to communicate covertly versus the case of a single-hop\ntransmission.

Besides\nthe variance of faces themselves, the intrinsic variance of image styles, e.g.,\ngrayscale vs. color images, light vs. dark, intense vs. dull, and so on, has\nconstantly been overlooked. This issue becomes inevitable as increasing web\nimages are collected from various sources for training neural networks. In this\nwork, we propose a style-aggregated approach to deal with the large intrinsic\nvariance of image styles for facial landmark detection. Our method transforms\noriginal face images to style-aggregated images by a generative adversarial\nmodule. The proposed scheme uses the style-aggregated image to maintain face\nimages that are more robust to environmental changes. Then the original face\nimages accompanying with style-aggregated ones play a duet to train a landmark\ndetector which is complementary to each other. In this way, for each face, our\nmethod takes two images as input, i.e., one in its original style and the other\nin the aggregated style. In experiments, we observe that the large variance of\nimage styles would degenerate the performance of facial landmark detectors.\nMoreover, we show the robustness of our method to the large variance of image\nstyles by comparing to a variant of our approach, in which the generative\nadversarial module is removed, and no style-aggregated images are used. Our\napproach is demonstrated to perform well when compared with state-of-the-art\nalgorithms on benchmark datasets AFLW and 300-W.

The photomeson process, which is usually suggested to operate in such a\nhadronic explanation, requires a rather high proton energy (> 10^17eV) for an\nefficient interaction. However, whether GRBs can accelerate protons to such a\nhigh energy is far from guaranteed, although they have been suggested as the\ncandidate source for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.

Typical examples of an almost distance function are the\ndistance function from a point and the Busemann function on a complete\nRiemannian manifold.

In the light of recent\nprogress, convolutional neural network based hashing methods typically seek\npair-wise or triplet labels to conduct the similarity preserving learning.\nHowever, complex semantic concepts of visual contents are hard to capture by\nsimilar/dissimilar labels, which limits the retrieval performance. Generally,\npair-wise or triplet losses not only suffer from expensive training costs but\nalso lack in extracting sufficient semantic information. In this regard, we\npropose a novel deep supervised hashing model to learn more compact class-level\nsimilarity preserving binary codes. Our deep learning based model is motivated\nby deep metric learning that directly takes semantic labels as supervised\ninformation in training and generates corresponding discriminant hashing code.\nSpecifically, a novel cubic constraint loss function based on Gaussian\ndistribution is proposed, which preserves semantic variations while penalizes\nthe overlap part of different classes in the embedding space. To address the\ndiscrete optimization problem introduced by binary codes, a two-step\noptimization strategy is proposed to provide efficient training and avoid the\nproblem of gradient vanishing. Extensive experiments on four large-scale\nbenchmark databases show that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art\nretrieval performance. Moreover, when training samples are limited, our method\nsurpasses other supervised deep hashing methods with non-negligible margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 07:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

We show, through simulation results, that rollout fused\nwith OCBA performs competitively with respect to rollout with total equal\nallocation (TEA) at a meagre simulation budget of 5-10% of rollout with TEA,\nwhich is a crucial step towards addressing large-scale community recovery\nproblems following natural disasters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 07:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 02:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Non-vanishing areas and nontrivial orientations of these Majorana\nunitarity triangles indicate non-zero $CP$ violation as a generic feature of\nthis class of mass models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 09:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

At these frequencies, beamforming\nappears as a straightforward solution to overcome higher path loss thereby\naltering the Doppler characteristics of the received waves. Higher frequencies\ncan suffer from strong Doppler impairments because of the linear dependency of\nDoppler shift with carrier frequency, which makes them challenging to use in\nhigh-mobility scenarios, particularly Vehicular-to-Infrastructure (V2I)\ncommunications. Therefore, the impact of beamforming on the Doppler\ncharacteristics of the received signals is of utter importance for future V2I\nsystems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the Doppler power\nspectrum in the presence of beamforming at the transmit and/or the receive\nsides. Further approximations are made for the resulting Doppler spread and\nDoppler shift when the receive beam width is sufficiently small, and a possible\ndesign solution is presented to control the Doppler spread in V2I systems.

A well-established interaction\ninvolves the exchange of a public good in Pseudomonas populations, where the\niron-scavenging compound pyoverdine, synthesized by some cells, is shared with\nthe rest. Pyoverdine thus mediates interactions between producers and\nnon-producers and can constitute a public good. This interaction is often used\nto test game theoretical predictions on the \"social dilemma\" of producers. Such\nan approach, however, underestimates the impact of specific properties of the\npublic good, for example consequences of its accumulation in the environment.\nHere, we experimentally quantify costs and benefits of pyoverdine production in\na specific environment, and build a model of population dynamics that\nexplicitly accounts for the changing significance of accumulating pyoverdine as\nchemical mediator of social interactions. The model predicts that, in an\nensemble of growing populations (metapopulation) with different initial\nproducer fractions (and consequently pyoverdine contents), the global producer\nfraction initially increases. Because the benefit of pyoverdine declines at\nsaturating concentrations, the increase need only be transient. Confirmed by\nexperiments on metapopulations, our results show how a changing benefit of a\npublic good can shape social interactions in a bacterial population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 10:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

Yet, such a delay,\nwhether present or not, is but a single quantity characterizing the tunnelling\nwavepacket; the underlying dynamics are richer.

This\nreshaping includes not only an effective time-delay but also time-reversal\nasymmetry of the ionization process, which we describe theoretically and\nobserve experimentally. We show how both delay and reshaping are mapped on the\npolarization properties of the Brunel radiation, with different harmonics\nbehaving as different hands of a clock moving at different speeds.

When used as a\nstatistical model for risk assessment in fields such as finance, insurance or\nmeteorology, it is crucial to understand which of the two asymptotic regimes\noccurs. Motivated by their ubiquity and flexibility, we consider the extremal\ndependence properties of vectors with a random scale construction\n$(X_1,X_2)=R(W_1,W_2)$, with non-degenerate $R>0$ independent of $(W_1,W_2)$.\nFocusing on the presence and strength of asymptotic tail dependence, as\nexpressed through commonly-used summary parameters, broad factors that affect\nthe results are: the heaviness of the tails of $R$ and $(W_1,W_2)$, the shape\nof the support of $(W_1,W_2)$, and dependence between $(W_1,W_2)$. When $R$ is\ndistinctly lighter tailed than $(W_1,W_2)$, the extremal dependence of\n$(X_1,X_2)$ is typically the same as that of $(W_1,W_2)$, whereas similar or\nheavier tails for $R$ compared to $(W_1,W_2)$ typically result in increased\nextremal dependence. Similar tail heavinesses represent the most interesting\nand technical cases, and we find both asymptotic independence and dependence of\n$(X_1,X_2)$ possible in such cases when $(W_1,W_2)$ exhibit asymptotic\nindependence. The bivariate case often directly extends to higher-dimensional\nvectors and spatial processes, where the dependence is mainly analyzed in terms\nof summaries of bivariate sub-vectors.

Differential rotation has a strong influence on stellar internal\ndynamics and evolution, notably by triggering hydrodynamical instabilities, by\ninteracting with the magnetic field, and more generally by inducing transport\nof angular momentum and chemical elements. Moreover, it modifies the way waves\npropagate in stellar interiors and thus the frequency spectrum of these waves,\nthe regions they probe, and the transport they generate.\n  Aims. We investigate the impact of a general differential rotation (both in\nradius and latitude) on the propagation of axisymmetric gravito-inertial waves.\n  Methods. We use a small-wavelength approximation to obtain a local dispersion\nrelation for these waves. We then describe the propagation of waves thanks to a\nray model that follows a Hamiltonian formalism. Finally, we numerically probe\nthe properties of these gravito-inertial rays for different regimes of radial\nand latitudinal differential rotation.\n  Results. We derive a local dispersion relation that includes the effect of a\ngeneral differential rotation.

Recent work has shown that causal consistency allows\n\"latency-optimal\" read-only transactions, that are nonblocking, single-version\nand single-round in terms of communication. On the surface, this latency\noptimality is very appealing, as the vast majority of applications are assumed\nto have read-dominated workloads.\n  In this paper, we show that such \"latency-optimal\" read-only transactions\ninduce an extra overhead on writes, the extra overhead is so high that\nperformance is actually jeopardized, even in read-dominated workloads.

The corresponding region in the mass-period distribution was\nassigned as the \"short-period Neptunian desert\".

Since odd multipoles of the halo\ncross-correlation function vanish when considering standard Doppler RSD, the\ndipole is a sensitive probe of relativistic and wide-angle effects. We build a\ncatalogue of ten million haloes (Milky-Way size to galaxy-cluster size) from\nthe full-sky light-cone of a new \"RayGalGroupSims\" N-body simulation which\ncovers a volume of ($2.625~h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$ with $4096^3$ particles.

We then self-consistently derive all the relativistic\ncontributions (in the weak-field approximation) to RSD: Doppler, transverse\nDoppler, gravitational, lensing and integrated Sachs-Wolfe. It allows us, for\nthe first time, to disentangle all contributions to the dipole from linear to\nnon-linear scales. At large scale, we recover the linear predictions dominated\nby a contribution from the divergence of neighbouring line-of-sights.

We\nstart by calculating the correlation between the input and quantization error\nand its effect on the quantized variance, first in the case of a real-valued\nquantizer with a zero mean Gaussian input and then in the case of a\ncomplex-valued quantizer with a circularly symmetric Gaussian input. We\ndemonstrate that this input-error correlation is always negative for a\nquantizer with an odd number of levels, while for an even number of levels this\ncorrelation is positive in the low signal level regime. In both cases there is\nan optimal interval for the input signal level for which this input-error\ncorrelation is very weak and the model of additive uncorrelated quantization\nnoise provides a very accurate approximation.

In this paper, we address this problem by present\na general method, named generalized multiple importance sampling (GMIS), to\nenhance the robustness of light transport simulation based on MIS. GMIS\ncombines different sampling techniques and weighting functions, extending MIS\nto a more generalized framework. Meanwhile, we implement the GMIS in common\nrenderers and illustrate how it increase the robustness of light transport\nsimulation. Experiments show that, by applying GMIS, we obtain better\nconvergence performance and lower variance, and increase the rendering of\nambient light and specular shadow effects apparently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 08:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

Matrices of similarity between individuals may be constructed from\nthese states, allowing for further structural insights to be gained using\nconcepts from random matrix theory, approach first exploited in this study. For\ngenerating random matrices that are appropriate as a structureless reference,\nwe propose a null model that enforces, on average, the empirical occurrence\nfrequency of each possible trait. With respect to this null model, the\nempirical matrices show deviating eigenvalues, which may be signatures of\nsubtle cultural groups. However, they can conceivably also be artifacts of\narbitrary redundancies between cultural variables. We first study this\npossibility in a highly simplified setting, using a toy model that enforces a\ncertain level of redundancy in a minimally-biased way, in parallel with another\ntoy model that enforces group structure. By analyzing and comparing cultural\nstates generated with these toy models, we show that a deviating eigenvalue can\nindeed be a redundancy signature, which can be distinguished from a grouping\nsignature by evaluating the uniformity of the entries of the respective\neigenvector, as well as the uniformity-based compatibility with the null model.\nFor empirical data, the eigenvector uniformities of all deviating eigenvalues\nare shown to be compatible with the null model, apparently suggesting that we\nare not dealing with genuine group structure. However, we demonstrate that some\ndeviating eigenvalues might actually be due to authentic groups that are\ninternally non-uniform.

It may be looked as a problem when it causes a loss in the\nground ray response to the shaded area, and may be, from other view, considered\nas an indication to the height of the bodies or buildings, when it hidden due\nto top view of the satellite image usually. The location of the object on the\nearth affects its shadow length, direction and darkness. The ostensible sun\npath in the sky also affects the shadow length and direction, it is depending\non the change of the rotation axis of planet about its center during the year.\nAnd it is clear that the shadow is changing with the sun transmission in the\nday times. The sun location needs complex equations, because there are several\nangles describing its location with taking into consideration the location of\nthe shaded body on the earth spatially the latitude, and the shadow direction\nand length depend on the sun location so it need more equations. Some\nengineering purposes, and some engineers and designer can not process these\ncomplex astronomy equations every time they need to calculate the shadow effect\non the urban region or garden for examples, or other architectural purposes, it\nis unpractical process to estimate the shadow direction and length for civil\nfrom these equation. So, we derived in this study a high accurate empirical\nGaussian equation to find shadow length percent in the limits of the study area\ndepends on single parameter which is the number of day during the year, and\ncalculating the percent of shadow, so we can calculate the shadow length\npercent accurately in any day number by the suggested equation after knowing\nthe real building height.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2018 21:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

Highly selective first level triggers are essential for the\nphysics programme of the ATLAS experiment at the HL-LHC where the instantaneous\nluminosity will exceed the LHC Run 1 instantaneous luminosity by almost an\norder of magnitude. The ATLAS first level muon trigger rate is dominated by low\nmomentum muons, selected due to the moderate momentum resolution of the\nresistive plate and thin gap trigger chambers. This limitation can be overcome\nby including the data of the precision muon drift tube (MDT) chambers in the\nfirst level trigger decision. This requires the fast continuous transfer of the\nMDT hits to the off-detector trigger logic and a fast track reconstruction\nalgorithm performed in the trigger logic.\n  In order to demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing tracks in MDT\nchambers within the short available first-level trigger latency of about\n3~$\\mu$s we implemented a seeded Hough transform on the ARM Cortex A9\nmicroprocessor of a Xilinx Zynq FPGA and studied its performance with test-beam\ndata recorded in CERN's Gamma Irradiation Facility.
