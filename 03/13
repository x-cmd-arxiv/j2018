A fundamental\nquestion is whether this transition is due to the localization of Cooper pairs\nor due to the destruction of them. Here we address this question by studying\nthe SIT in amorphous WSi. Transport measurements reveal the localization of\nCooper pairs at a quantum critical field B_c^1 (Bose-insulator), with a product\nof the correlation length and dynamical exponents zv~4/3 near the quantum\ncritical point (QCP). Beyond B_c^1, superconducting fluctuations still persist\nat finite temperatures. Above a second critical field B_c^2>B_c^1, the Cooper\npairs are destroyed and the film becomes a Fermi-insulator. The different\nphases all merge at a tricritical point at finite temperatures with zv=2/3.

(2006), where the\nincrease and decrease in the disk accretion rate is accompanied by a\nmodification of the disk magnetization $\\mu \\propto B_z^2/\\dot{m}_{in}$, which\nin turn determines the dominant torque allowing accretion. For $\\mu>0.1$, the\naccretion flow produces jets that vertically, carry away the disk angular\nmomentum (jet-emitting disk or JED). The goal of this paper is to investigate\nthe spectral signatures of the JED configurations. We have developed a\ntwo-temperature plasma code that computes the disk local thermal equilibria,\ntaking into account the advection of energy in an iterative way. Our code\naddresses optically thin-to-thick transitions, both radiation and gas supported\nregimes and computes in a consistent way the emitted spectrum from a\nsteady-state disk. The optically thin emission is obtained using the BELM code,\nwhich provides accurate spectra for bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission\nprocesses as well as for their local Comptonization. For a range in radius and\naccretion rates, JEDs exhibit three thermal equilibria, one thermally unstable\nand two stables. Due to the existence of two thermally stable solutions, a\nhysteresis cycle is naturally obtained. However, standard outbursting X-ray\nbinary cycles cannot be reproduced. Another striking feature of JEDs is their\nability to reproduce luminous hard states. Showing that when the loss of\nangular momentum and power in jets is consistently taken into account,\naccretion disks have spectral signatures that are consistent with hard states,\neven up to high luminosities. The reproduction of soft states being well\nperformed by standard accretion disks (SAD), this study argues for the\nexistence of hybrid disk configuration: JED and SAD. A study of such hybrid\nconfiguration will be presented in a forthcoming paper III.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 16:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Here we\npropose a hybrid paradigm for quantum annealers with the goal of mitigating a\ndifferent limitation of such devices: the need to embed problem instances\nwithin the (often highly restricted) connectivity graph of the annealer. This\nembedding process can be costly to perform and may destroy any computational\nspeedup. In order to solve many practical problems, it is moreover necessary to\nperform many, often related, such embeddings. We will show how, for such\nproblems, a raw speedup that is negated by the embedding time can nonetheless\nbe exploited to give a real speedup. As a proof-of-concept example we present\nan in-depth case study of a simple problem based on the maximum weight\nindependent set problem.

Large-scale simulations of the SAN tissue, represented by a\nheterogeneous tissue structure of pacemaker cells, exhibit a rich repertoire of\nbehaviors, including complete synchrony, traveling waves of activity\noriginating from periphery to center, and transient traveling waves originating\nfrom the center. We use phase reduction methods that do not require fully\nsimulating the large-scale model to capture these observations.

With the reduced phase\nmodels, we analyze the relationship between cell distributions and coupling\nstrengths and the resulting transient dynamics.

Here we study the\npopulation dynamics of spreading cells, investigating the characteristic\nprocesses involved in cell response to the substrate. We show that unlike the\nindividual cell morphology, this population dynamics does not depend on the\nsubstrate stiffness. Instead, a strong activation temperature dependence is\nobserved. Different cell lines on different substrates all have long-time\nstatistics controlled by the thermal activation over a single energy barrier\ndG=19 kcal/mol, while the early-time kinetics follows a power law $t^5$. This\nimplies that the rate of spreading depends on an internal process of\nadhesion-mechanosensing complex assembly and activation: the operational\ncomplex must have 5 component proteins, and the last process in the sequence\n(which we believe is the activation of focal adhesion kinase) is controlled by\nthe binding energy dG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 17:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 02:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 16:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

However, each of\nthe two main theories (core accretion, gravitational instability) is unable to\nexplain some key aspects. In many planet formation calculations, it is usual to\ntreat the initial properties of the planet forming disc (mass, radius, etc.) as\nfree parameters. In this paper, we stress the importance of setting the\nformation of planet forming discs within the context of the formation of the\ncentral stars. By exploring the early stages of disc formation, we introduce\nthe concept of the Maximum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN), as opposed to the oft-used\nMinimum Mass Solar Nebula (here mmsn). It is evident that almost all\nprotoplanetary discs start their evolution in a strongly self-gravitating\nstate. In agreement with almost all previous work in this area, we conclude\nthat on the scales relevant to planet formation these discs are not\ngravitationally unstable to gas fragmentation, but instead form strong,\ntransient spiral arms. These spiral arms can act as efficient dust traps\nallowing the accumulation and subsequent fragmentation of the dust (but not the\ngas). This phase is likely to populate the disc with relatively large\nplanetesimals on short timescales while the disc is still veiled by a dusty-gas\nenvelope. Crucially, the early formation of large planetesimals overcomes the\nmain barriers remaining within the core accretion model. A prediction of this\npicture is that essentially all observable protoplanetary discs are already\nplanet hosting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

CR\nacceleration in clusters is mostly attributed to the dynamical activity that\nproduces shocks. Shocks in clusters emerge out of merger or accretion, but\nwhich one is more effective in producing CRs? at which dynamical phase? and\nwhy? To this aim, we study the production or injection of CRs through shocks\nand its evolution in the galaxy clusters using cosmological simulations with\nthe {\\sc enzo} code. Particle acceleration model considered here is primarily\nthe Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) of thermal particles, but we also report\na tentative study with pre-existing CRs. Defining appropriate dynamical states\nusing the concept of virialization, we studied a sample of merging and\nnon-merging clusters. We report that the merger shocks (with Mach number\n$\\mathcal{M}\\sim2-5$) are the most effective CR producers, while high-Mach\nperipheral shocks (i.e. $\\mathcal{M}>5$) are mainly responsible for the\nbrightest phase of CR injection in clusters. Clusters once merged, permanently\ndeviate from CR and X-ray mass scaling of non-merging systems, enabling us to\nuse it as a tool to determine the state of merger. Through a temporal and\nspatial evolution study, we found a strong correlation between cluster merger\ndynamics and CR injection. We observed that the brightest phase of X-ray and CR\ninjection from clusters occur respectively at about 1.0 and 1.5 Gyr after every\nmergers, and CR injection peaks near to the cluster virial radius (i.e\n$r_{200}$).

In the offline setting, the two natural objectives are profit\nmaximization, i.e., embedding a maximal number of request graphs subject to the\nresource constraints, and cost minimization, i.e., embedding all requests at\nminimal overall cost. The VNEP can be seen as a generalization of classic\nrouting and call admission problems, in which requests are arbitrary graphs\nwhose communication endpoints are not fixed. Due to its applications, the\nproblem has been studied intensively in the networking community. However, the\nunderlying algorithmic problem is hardly understood.\n  This paper presents the first fixed-parameter tractable approximation\nalgorithms for the VNEP. Our algorithms are based on randomized rounding. Due\nto the flexible mapping options and the arbitrary request graph topologies, we\nshow that a novel linear program formulation is required. Only using this novel\nformulation the computation of convex combinations of valid mappings is\nenabled, as the formulation needs to account for the structure of the request\ngraphs. Accordingly, to capture the structure of request graphs, we introduce\nthe graph-theoretic notion of extraction orders and extraction width and show\nthat our algorithms have exponential runtime in the request graphs' maximal\nwidth. Hence, for request graphs of fixed extraction width, we obtain the first\npolynomial-time approximations.\n  Studying the new notion of extraction orders we show that (i) computing\nextraction orders of minimal width is NP-hard and (ii) that computing\ndecomposable LP solutions is in general NP-hard, even when restricting request\ngraphs to planar ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 18:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The eight stars consist of four pairs,\nwith each pair occupying a distinct phase of stellar evolution: two G-dwarfs,\ntwo turnoff stars, two G-subgiants, and two red clump K-giants. The abundance\nanalysis uses near-IR high-resolution spectra ($\\lambda$1.5 -- 1.7$\\mu$m) from\nthe APOGEE survey and derives abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca,\nTi, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe. Our derived stellar parameters and metallicity for\n2M08510076+113115 suggest that this star is a solar-twin, exhibiting abundance\ndifferences relative to the Sun of $\\leq$ 0.04 dex for all elements. Chemical\nhomogeneity is found within each class of stars ($\\sim$0.02 dex), while\nsignificant abundance variations ($\\sim$0.05 -- 0.20 dex) are found across the\ndifferent evolutionary phases; the turnoff stars typically have the lowest\nabundances, while the red clump tend to have the largest. Non-LTE corrections\nto the LTE-derived abundances are unlikely to explain the differences. A\ndetailed comparison of the derived Fe, Mg, Si, and Ca abundances with recently\npublished surface abundances from stellar models that include chemical\ndiffusion, provides a good match between the observed and predicted abundances\nas a function of stellar mass. Such agreement would indicate the detection of\nchemical diffusion processes in the stellar members of M67.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 18:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

We first demonstrate that given a corrupted version\nof an image that truly lies on the GAN manifold, we can approximately recover\nthe latent vector and denoise the image, obtaining significantly higher\nquality, comparing with BM3D. Next, we demonstrate that latent vectors\nrecovered from noisy images exhibit a consistent bias. By subtracting this bias\nbefore projecting back to image space, we improve denoising results even\nfurther. Finally, even for unseen images, our method performs better at\ndenoising better than BM3D. Notably, the basic version of our method (without\nbias correction) requires no prior knowledge on the noise variance. To achieve\nthe highest possible denoising quality, the best performing signal processing\nbased methods, such as BM3D, require an estimate of the blur kernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 19:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The main contribution of this\npaper is to show that the subjective choice of data and analysis methodology\nsubstantially impacts the identification of factors and outcomes of\nobservational studies. This subjective variability of inference is at the heart\nof recent discussions around irreproducibility in scientific research. To\ndemonstrate this subjective variability, data is taken from an existing study,\nwhere interest centres on understanding the factors associated with a young\nadult's propensity to fall into the category of `not in employment, education\nor training' (NEET). A fully probabilistic analysis is performed, set in a\nBayesian framework and implemented using Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (RJMCMC). The results show that different techniques lead to different\ninference but that models consisting of different factors often have the same\npredictive performance, whether the analysis is frequentist or Bayesian, making\ninference problematic. We demonstrate how the use of prior distributions in\nBayesian techniques can be used to as a tool for assessing a factor's\nimportance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 19:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

It is also natural to\nconsider quiver representations in a richer category, namely that of vector\nbundles on some complex variety equipped with a fixed sheaf that twists the\nmorphisms. Representations of A-type quivers in this twisted category --- known\nin the literature as \"holomorphic chains\" --- have practical use in questions\nconcerning the topology of the moduli space of Higgs bundles. In that problem,\nthe variety is a Riemann surface of genus at least 2, and the twist is its\ncanonical line bundle. We extend the treatment of twisted A-type quiver\nrepresentations to any genus using the Hitchin stability condition induced by\nHiggs bundles and computing their deformation theory.

Digital computers can indeed surprise us. Just like a piece of art,\nalgorithms can be designed in such a way as to lead us to question our\nunderstanding of the world, or our place within it. Some humans do lose the\ncapacity to be surprised in that way. It might be fear, or it might be the\ncomfort of ideological certainties. As lazy normative animals, we do need to be\nable to rely on authorities to simplify our reasoning: that is ok. Yet the\ngrowing sophistication of systems designed to free us from the constraints of\nnormative engagement may take us past a point of no-return. What if, through\nlack of normative exercise, our moral muscles became so atrophied as to leave\nus unable to question our social practices? This paper makes two distinct\nnormative claims:\n  1. Decision-support systems should be designed with a view to regularly\njolting us out of our moral torpor.\n  2. Without the depth of habit to somatically anchor model certainty, a\ncomputer s experience of something new is very different from that which in\nhumans gives rise to non-trivial surprises. This asymmetry has key\nrepercussions when it comes to the shape of ethical agency in artificial moral\nagents. The worry is not just that they would be likely to leap morally ahead\nof us, unencumbered by habits. The main reason to doubt that the moral\ntrajectories of humans v. autonomous systems might remain compatible stems from\nthe asymmetry in the mechanisms underlying moral change. Whereas in humans\nsurprises will continue to play an important role in waking us to the need for\nmoral change, cognitive processes will rule when it comes to machines. This\nasymmetry will translate into increasingly different moral outlooks, to the\npoint of likely unintelligibility. The latter prospect is enough to doubt the\ndesirability of autonomous moral agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

However, if some of the sensors\nare providing lower quality outputs, the fused results can be degraded. In this\nwork, a multi-sensor conflict measure is proposed which estimates multi-sensor\nconflict by representing each sensor output as interval-valued information and\nexamines the sensor output overlaps on all possible n-tuple sensor\ncombinations. The conflict is based on the sizes of the intervals and how many\nsensors output values lie in these intervals. In this work, conflict is defined\nin terms of how little the output from multiple sensors overlap. That is, high\ndegrees of overlap mean low sensor conflict, while low degrees of overlap mean\nhigh conflict. This work is a preliminary step towards a robust conflict and\nsensor fusion framework. In addition, a sensor fusion algorithm is proposed\nbased on a weighted sum of sensor outputs, where the weights for each sensor\ndiminish as the conflict measure increases. The proposed methods can be\nutilized to (1) assess a measure of multi-sensor conflict, and (2) improve\nsensor output fusion by lessening weighting for sensors with high conflict.\nUsing this measure, a simulated example is given to explain the mechanics of\ncalculating the conflict measure, and stereo camera 3D outputs are analyzed and\nfused. In the stereo camera case, the sensor output is corrupted by additive\nimpulse noise, DC offset, and Gaussian noise. Impulse noise is common in\nsensors due to intermittent interference, a DC offset a sensor bias or\nregistration error, and Gaussian noise represents a sensor output with low SNR.\nThe results show that sensor output fusion based on the conflict measure shows\nimproved accuracy over a simple averaging fusion strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 22:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs).

The motivation comes from wireless networking, where\nwe seek to model the irregularities seen in actual wireless environments. Not\nall node pairs may be able to communicate, even if geographically close ---\nthus, the available pairs are modeled with a link graph $\\mathcal{L}=(V,E)$.\nAlso, signal attenuation need not follow a nice geometric formulas --- hence,\ninterference is modeled by a conflict (hyper)graph $\\mathcal{C}=(E,F)$ on the\nlinks. The objective is to maximize the efficiency of the communication, or\nequivalently minimizing the length of a schedule of the tree edges in the form\nof a coloring.\n  We find that in spite of all this generality, the problem can be approximated\nlinearly in terms of a versatile parameter, the inductive independence of the\ninterference graph. Specifically, we give a simple algorithm that attains a\n$O(\\rho \\log n)$-approximation, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\\rho$ is\nthe inductive independence, and show that near-linear dependence on $\\rho$ is\nalso necessary.

In this\nrespect two intertwined aspects are important: stability and reversibility. It\nis crucial to understand on the one hand how a glass may become unstable due to\nincreased plasticity under shear deformations; on the other hand, to what\nextent the response is reversible, meaning how much a system is able to recover\nthe original configuration once the perturbation is released. Here we focus on\nassemblies of hard spheres as the simplest model of amorphous solids such as\ncolloidal glasses and granular matter. We prepare glass states quenched from\nequilibrium supercooled liquid states, which are obtained by using the swap\nMonte Carlo algorithm and correspond to a wide range of structural relaxation\ntime scales. We exhaustively map out their stability and reversibility under\nvolume and shear strains, using extensive numerical simulations. The region on\nthe volume-shear strain phase diagram where the original glass state remains\nsolid is bounded by the shear-yielding and the shear-jamming lines which meet\nat a yielding-jamming crossover point. This solid phase can be further divided\ninto two sub-phases: the stable glass phase where the system deforms purely\nelastically and is totally reversible, and the marginal glass phase where it\nexperiences stochastic plastic deformations at mesoscopic scales and is\npartially irreversible. The details of the stability-reversibility map depend\nstrongly on the quality of annealing of the glass. This study provides a\nunified framework for understanding elasticity, plasticity, yielding and\njamming in amorphous solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 02:15:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 09:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

Predictions in quantum mechanics are\nmade from probabilities for sets of alternative histories. Probabilities can be\nassigned only to sets of histories that approximately decohere. Decoherence is\ndefined and the mechanism of decoherence is reviewed. Decoherence requires a\nsufficiently coarse-grained description of alternative histories of the\nuniverse. A quasiclassical domain consists of a branching set of alternative\ndecohering histories, described by a coarse graining that is maximally refined\nconsistent with decoherence, with individual branches that exhibit a high level\nof classical correlation in time. A quasiclassical domain is emergent in the\nuniverse as a consequence of the initial condition and the action function of\nthe elementary particles. It is an important question whether all the\nquasiclassical domains are roughly equivalent or whether there are various\nessentially inequivalent ones. A measurement is a correlation with variables in\na quasiclassical domain.

As a result almost all video encoders have five to ten times\nmore complexity than their decoders. In a video compression process, one of the\nmain tasks at the encoder side is motion estimation which is to extract the\ntemporal correlation between frames. Distributed video coding (DVC) proposed\nthe idea that can lead to low complexity encoders and higher complexity\ndecoders. DVC is a new paradigm in video compression based on the information\ntheoretic ideas of Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv theorems. Wyner-Ziv coding is\nnaturally robust against transmission errors and can be used for joint source\nand channel coding. Side Information is one of the key components of the\nWyner-Ziv decoder. Better side information generation will result in better\nfunctionality of Wyner-Ziv coder. In this paper we proposed a new method that\ncan generate side information with a better quality and thus better\ncompression. We have used HVS (human visual system) based image quality metrics\nas our quality criterion. The motion estimation we used in the decoder is\nmodified due to these metrics such that we could obtain finer side information.\nThe motion compensation is optimized for perceptual quality metrics and leads\nto better side information generation compared to con- ventional MSE (mean\nsquared error) or SAD (sum of absolute difference) based motion compensation\ncurrently used in the literature. Better motion compensation means better\ncompression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 04:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Media can be images, audio clips,\nvideos and etc. Digital watermarking is today extensively used for many\napplications such as authentication of ownership or identification of illegal\ncopies. Digital watermark is an invisible or maybe visible structure added to\nthe original media (known as asset). Images are considered as communication\nchannel when they are subject to a watermark embedding procedure so in the case\nof embedding a digital watermark in an image, the capacity of the channel\nshould be considered. There is a trade-off between imperceptibility, robustness\nand capacity for embedding a watermark in an asset. In the case of image\nwatermarks, it is reasonable that the watermarking algorithm should depend on\nthe content and structure of the image. Conventionally, mean squared error\n(MSE) has been used as a common distortion measure to assess the quality of the\nimages. Newly developed quality metrics proposed some distortion measures that\nare based on human visual system (HVS). These metrics show that MSE is not\nbased on HVS and it has a lack of accuracy when dealing with perceptually\nimportant signals such as images and videos. SSIM or structural similarity is a\nstate of the art HVS based image quality criterion that has recently been of\nmuch interest. In this paper we propose a robust least significant bit (LSB)\nwatermarking scheme which is optimized for structural similarity. The watermark\nis embedded into a host image through an adaptive algorithm. Various attacks\nexamined on the embedding approach and simulation results revealed the fact\nthat the watermarked sequence can be extracted with an acceptable accuracy\nafter all attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 04:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

To cope\nwith this problem, Davenport et al. (2014) proposed a binary matrix completion\n(BMC) problem, where observations are quantized into binary values. Hsieh et\nal.

An application and related empirical investigation\nresults allow us to verify probabilistic calibration and predictive skills of\nour polyhedra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 08:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-20"}

Here, based on first-principles calculations, we\ninvestigate the electronic properties of carbon nanothreads under the influence\nof two important factors: the Stone-Wales (SW) type defect and the lattice\nstrain. The SW defect is intrinsic to the polymer-I structure of the\nnanothreads and is a building block for the general hybrid structures. We find\nthat the bandgap of the nanothreads can be tuned by the concentration of SW\ndefects in a wide range of $3.92 \\sim 4.82$ eV, interpolating between the\nbandgaps of $sp^{3}$-(3,0) structure and the polymer-I structure. Under strain,\nthe bandgaps of all the structures, including the hybrid ones, show a\nnonmonotonic variation: the bandgap first increases with strain, then drops at\nlarge strain above 10%. The gap size can be effectively tuned by strain in a\nwide range ($>0.5$ eV). Interestingly, for $sp^{3}$-(3,0) structure, a switch\nof band ordering occurs under strain at the valence band maximum, and for the\npolymer-I structure, an indirect-to-direct-bandgap transition occurs at about\n8% strain.

We first produce a 3D model of rotating\nconvection and then introduce idealized magnetic structures close to the bottom\nof the computational domain. These structures possess a certain degree of field\nline twist and they are made buoyant on a particular extension in longitude.\nThe resulting twisted $\\Omega$-loops will thus evolve inside a spherical\nconvective shell possessing large-scale mean flows. We present results on the\ninteraction between two such loops with various initial parameters (mainly\nbuoyancy and twist) and on the complexity of the emerging magnetic field. In\nagreement with analytical predictions, we find that if the loops are introduced\nwith opposite handedness and same axial field direction or same handedness but\nopposite axial field, they bounce against each other. The emerging region is\nthen constituted of two separated bipolar structures. On the contrary, if the\nloops are introduced with the same direction of axial and peripheral magnetic\nfields and if sufficiently close, they merge while rising.

This\nphenomenon has been observed in many symmetric and nearly-symmetric systems.\nDifferent physical origins of the hindrance have been proposed. This work aims\nto study the probable effects of direct reactions on deep sub-barrier fusion\ncross sections. Fusion (evaporation residue) cross sections have been measured\nfor the system $^{19}$F+$^{181}$Ta, from above the barrier down to the energies\nwhere fusion hindrance is expected to come into play. Coupled-channels\ncalculation with standard Woods-Saxon potential gives a fair description of the\nfusion excitation function down to energies $\\simeq 14\\%$ below the barrier for\nthe present system. This is in contrast with the observation of increasing\nfusion hindrance in asymmetric reactions induced by increasingly heavier\nprojectiles, \\textit{viz.} $^{6,7}$Li, $^{11}$B, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O. The\nasymmetric reactions, which have not shown any signature of fusion hindrance\nwithin the measured energy range, are found to be induced by projectiles with\nlower $\\alpha$ break-up threshold, compared to the reactions which have shown\nsignatures of fusion hindrance.

In order to probe measurement-induced effects in the\nstate dynamics using a quantum simulator, the challenge is to implement\ncontrolled measurements on a small subspace of the system and continue the\nevolution from the complementary subspace. A powerful platform for versatile\nquantum evolution is represented by photonic quantum walks due to their high\ncontrol over all relevant parameters. However, measurement-induced dynamics in\nsuch a platform have not yet been realized. Here we implement controlled\nmeasurements in a discrete-time quantum walk based on time multiplexing. This\nis achieved by adding a deterministic out-coupling of the optical signal to\ninclude measurements constrained to specific positions resulting in the\nprojection of the walker's state on the remaining ones. With this platform and\ncoherent input light we experimentally simulate measurement-induced single\nparticle quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the difference between dynamics with\nonly a single measurement at the final step and those including measurements\nduring the evolution. To this aim we study recurrence as a figure of merit,\ni.e. the return probability to the walker's starting position, which is\nmeasured in the two cases. We track the development of the return probability\nover 36 time steps and observe the onset of both recurrent and transient\nevolution as an effect of the different measurement schemes, a signature which\nonly emerges for quantum systems. Our simulation of the observed one particle\nconditional quantum dynamics does not require a genuine quantum particle but is\ndemonstrated with coherent light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 10:27:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 11:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Both cases display\nsaturation towards a steady state but do not fully thermalize. Depending on the\nlocation and size of the interval, the entanglement entropy displays a variety\nof interesting phenomena such as plateau phases, bumps, and discontinuities in\nits first derivative with respect to time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 10:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 19:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

In particular, we study the thrust distribution at the $Z$ pole\nand show that the region where non-perturbative corrections due to the\nhadronisation process are small is considerably extended if soft drop is\napplied. Therefore, we argue that the use of soft drop to reduce hadronisation\neffects is potentially of great benefit in the context of strong coupling\ndetermination using event shapes, which would be otherwise characterised by a\nstrong correlation between $\\alpha_s$ and non-perturbative parameters. However,\nreduced sensitivity to hadronisation corrections is only one of the aspects\nthat need to be considered.

Here, we propose a systematic procedure for\npre- and post-processing generic point process data in an objective manner, to\nhandle data in the framework of a binary simple statistical model, the Ising or\ngeneralized McCulloch--Pitts model. The procedure involves two steps: (1)\ndetermining time-bin size for transforming the point-process data into\ndiscrete-time binary data and (2) screening relevant couplings from the\nestimated couplings. For the first step, we decide the optimal time-bin size by\nintroducing the null hypothesis that all neurons would fire independently, then\nchoosing a time-bin size so that the null hypothesis is rejected with the most\nstrict criterion. The likelihood associated with the null hypothesis is\nanalytically evaluated and used for the rejection process. For the second\npost-processing step, after a certain estimator of coupling is obtained based\non the pre-processed dataset, the estimate is compared with many other\nestimates derived from datasets obtained by randomizing the original dataset in\nthe time direction. We accept the original estimate as relevant only if its\nabsolute value is sufficiently larger than them of randomized datasets. These\nmanipulations suppress false positive couplings induced by statistical noise.\nWe apply this inference procedure to spiking data from synthetic and in vitro\nneuronal networks. The results show that the proposed procedure identifies the\npresence/absence of synaptic couplings fairly well including their signs, for\nthe synthetic and experimental data. In particular, the results support that we\ncan infer the physical connections of underlying systems in favorable\nsituations, even when using the simple statistical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 11:44:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 10:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

We present sensible choices of parametric link\nfunctions which possess desirable properties. It is important to estimate the\nparameters of the link function, rather than assume a known value.

Inspired by previous work on scaling laws in\nother systems, here we extend the notion of size of firms from a scalar to a\nvector in order to characterize in more detail the mechanisms of growth and\ndecay of firms. Based on a large scale dataset of Japanese firms covering over\ntwo million firms for two decades (1994-2015), we compile the dataset of\nvectors of three components, namely, annual sales, number of employee and\nnumber of trading partners. We find that the number of employees is more\ninfluential in determining firm sales compared to the number of trading\npartners. This asymmetry is validated by regressions of sales against these\nparameters and the analysis of growth rate correlations. We then explore\nmulti-variate dynamics of firms by elaborating an evolutionary flow diagram of\nthe averaged motion in the three-dimensional vector space. The flow diagram\nindicates that firms which deviate from the balanced scaling relation tend to\nreturn to this relation. We also find that firms with a chance of large sales\ngrowth suffer the risk of high disappearance rate. These results could serve\nfor prediction and modeling of firms, and are relevant for theoretical\nunderstanding of the general principles governing complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 12:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Instead, strong interband\ntransitions to the valence band maximum are concentrated in the infrared with\nenergies below 1.3 eV. This is contrast to the valence bands of many wide band\ngap materials. Turning to the mobility we find that the states at the valence\nband maximum are relatively dispersive.

Such a device,\nbesides exhibiting spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP), needs to be highly\nscalable, have a large endurance and require low energy for transitioning\nbetween states. In this work, we first introduce and empirically determine two\nnew specifications for an synapse in SNNs: number of conductance levels per\nsynapse and maximum learning-rate. To the best of our knowledge, there are no\nRRAMs that meet the latter specification. As a solution, we propose the use of\nmultiple PCMO-RRAMs in parallel within a synapse. While synaptic reading, all\nPCMO-RRAMs are simultaneously read and for each synaptic conductance-change\nevent, the mechanism for conductance STDP is initiated for only one RRAM,\nrandomly picked from the set. Second, to validate our solution, we\nexperimentally demonstrate STDP of conductance of a PCMO-RRAM and then show\nthat due to a large learning-rate, a single PCMO-RRAM fails to model a synapse\nin the training of an SNN. As anticipated, network training improves as more\nPCMO-RRAMs are added to the synapse. Fourth, we discuss the\ncircuit-requirements for implementing such a scheme, to conclude that the\nrequirements are within bounds. Thus, our work presents specifications for\nsynaptic devices in trainable SNNs, indicates the shortcomings of state-of-art\nsynaptic contenders, and provides a solution to extrinsically meet the\nspecifications and discusses the peripheral circuitry that implements the\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 13:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

We therefore complement\nit with a supervised loss aiming to predict the correct pose in a small set of\nlabeled images, and with a regularization term that penalizes drift from\ninitial predictions.

However, such potential is limited by hardware cost and power\nconsumption associated with a large number of RF chains. Recently, one-bit\nquantization is proposed to address this issue by replacing high-resolution\ndigital-to-analog converters (DACs) with one-bit DACs, thereby simplifying the\nRF chains. Despite low system cost, advanced signal processing techniques are\nneeded to compensate for quantization distortions caused by low resolution\nDACs. In this paper, a symbol-error-rate (SER)-based one-bit precoding scheme\nis proposed to minimize the detection error probability of all users under\none-bit constraints. The problem is recast as a continuous optimization problem\nwith a biconvex objective. By applying the block coordinate descent (BCD)\nmethod and the FISTA method, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to\nobtain a one-bit precoding solution.

A high indistinguishability (~90%) of our time-multiplexed\nphotons has also been confirmed. We also experimentally investigate trade-off\nrelations of single-photon probability and unwanted multi-photon contribution\nby using different pump powers for a HSPS. Our results demonstrate that\nlow-loss, large-scale multiplexing can realize highly efficient single-photon\ngeneration as well as highly scalable multi-photon generation from inefficient\nHSPSs. We predict that our large-scale time multiplexing will pave the way\ntoward generation of > 30 coincident photons with unprecedented efficiencies,\nenabling a new frontier in optical quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 13:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

In this paper, we propose WISERNet (the wider\nseparate-then-reunion network) for steganalysis of color images. We provide\ntheoretical rationale to claim that the summation in normal convolution is one\nsort of \"linear collusion attack\" which reserves strong correlated patterns\nwhile impairs uncorrelated noises. Therefore in the bottom convolutional layer\nwhich aims at suppressing correlated image contents, we adopt separate\nchannel-wise convolution without summation instead. Conversely, in the upper\nconvolutional layers we believe that the summation in normal convolution is\nbeneficial. Therefore we adopt united normal convolution in those layers and\nmake them remarkably wider to reinforce the effect of \"linear collusion\nattack\". As a result, our proposed wide-and-shallow, separate-then-reunion\nnetwork structure is specifically suitable for color image steganalysis. We\nhave conducted extensive experiments on color image datasets generated from\nBOSSBase raw images and another large-scale dataset which contains 100,000 raw\nimages, with different demosaicking algorithms and down-sampling algorithms.\nThe experimental results show that our proposed network outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art color image steganalytic models either hand-crafted or learned\nusing deep networks in the literature by a clear margin.

However, RNNs are commonly difficult to train due to the\nwell-known gradient vanishing and exploding problems and hard to learn\nlong-term patterns. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit\n(GRU) were developed to address these problems, but the use of hyperbolic\ntangent and the sigmoid action functions results in gradient decay over layers.\nConsequently, construction of an efficiently trainable deep network is\nchallenging. In addition, all the neurons in an RNN layer are entangled\ntogether and their behaviour is hard to interpret. To address these problems, a\nnew type of RNN, referred to as independently recurrent neural network\n(IndRNN), is proposed in this paper, where neurons in the same layer are\nindependent of each other and they are connected across layers. We have shown\nthat an IndRNN can be easily regulated to prevent the gradient exploding and\nvanishing problems while allowing the network to learn long-term dependencies.\nMoreover, an IndRNN can work with non-saturated activation functions such as\nrelu (rectified linear unit) and be still trained robustly. Multiple IndRNNs\ncan be stacked to construct a network that is deeper than the existing RNNs.\nExperimental results have shown that the proposed IndRNN is able to process\nvery long sequences (over 5000 time steps), can be used to construct very deep\nnetworks (21 layers used in the experiment) and still be trained robustly.\nBetter performances have been achieved on various tasks by using IndRNNs\ncompared with the traditional RNN and LSTM.

Here, we present a reaction rate\ntheory for supramolecular kinetics based on Kramers rate theory for diffusive\nreactions over multiple kinetic barriers, and apply the results to protein\naggregation. Using this framework and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that\nreaction rates for protein aggregation are of the Arrhenius-Eyring type and\nthat the associated activation energies probe only one relevant barrier along\nthe respective free energy landscapes. We apply this advancement to interpret,\nboth in experiments and in coarse-grained computer simulations, reaction rate\nmeasurements of amyloid aggregation kinetics in terms of the underlying\nmolecular mechanisms and associated thermodynamic signatures. Our results\nestablish a general platform for probing the mechanisms and energetics of\nsupramolecular phenomena in soft- and biological matter using the framework of\nchemical kinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 14:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Using melting probe technology is one of the\npromising technological approaches to reach those scientifically interesting\nwater reservoirs. Melting probes basically consist of a heated melting head on\ntop of an elongated body that contains the scientific payload. The traditional\nengineering approach to design such melting probes starts from a global energy\nbalance around the melting head and quantifies the power necessary to sustain a\nspecific melting velocity while preventing the probe from refreezing and stall\nin the channel. Though this approach is sufficient to design simple melting\nprobes for terrestrial applications, it is too simplistic to study the probe's\nperformance for environmental conditions found on some of the Ocean's Worlds,\ne.g. a lower value of the gravitational acceleration. This will be important,\nhowever, when designing exploration technologies for extraterrestrial purposes.\nWe tackle the problem by explicitly modeling the physical processes in the thin\nmelt film between the probe and the underlying ice. Our model allows to study\nmelting regimes on bodies of different gravitational acceleration, and we\nexplicitly compare melting regimes on Europa, Enceladus and Mars. In addition\nto that, our model allows to quantify the heat losses due to convective\ntransport around the melting probe.

Under the single-fluid formalism the main\nnon-ideal effects are described by a series of extra terms in the generalised\ninduction equation and in the energy conservation equation. These effects are:\nOhmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, the Hall effect, and the Biermann battery\neffect. From the point of view of the numerical solution of the single-fluid\nequations, when ambipolar diffusion or Hall effects dominate can introduce\nsevere restrictions on the integration time step and can compromise the\nstability of the numerical scheme. In this paper we introduce two numerical\nschemes to overcome those limitations. The first of them is known as Super\nTime-Stepping (STS) and it is designed to overcome the limitations imposed when\nthe ambipolar diffusion term is dominant. The second scheme is called the Hall\nDiffusion Scheme (HDS) and it is used when the Hall term becomes dominant.\nThese two numerical techniques can be used together by applying Strang operator\nsplitting. This paper describes the implementation of the STS and HDS schemes\nin the single-fluid code Mancha3D. The validation for each of these schemes is\nprovided by comparing the analytical solution with the numerical one for a\nsuite of numerical tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 15:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Such processes are fitted to computer model output\nusing a set of training runs to learn the parameters of the process covariance\nkernel. The stationarity assumption is often adequate, yet can lead to poor\npredictive performance when the model response exhibits nonstationarity, for\nexample, if its smoothness varies across the input space. In this paper, we\nintroduce a diagnostic-led approach to fitting nonstationary GP emulators by\nspecifying finite mixtures of region-specific covariance kernels. Our method\nfirst fits a stationary GP and, if traditional diagnostics exhibit\nnonstationarity, those diagnostics are used to fit appropriate mixing functions\nfor a covariance kernel mixture designed to capture the nonstationarity,\nensuring an emulator that is continuous in parameter space and readily\ninterpretable. We compare our approach to the principal nonstationary GP models\nin the literature and illustrate its performance on a number of idealised test\ncases and in an application to modelling the cloud parameterization of the\nFrench climate model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 15:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 16:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

Until\nrecently, it was believed that proportional electroluminescence was fully due\nto VUV emission of noble gas excimers produced in atomic collisions with\nexcited atoms, the latter being in turn produced by drifting electrons. In this\nwork we consider an additional mechanism of proportional electroluminescence,\nnamely that of bremsstrahlung of drifting electrons scattered on neutral atoms\n(so-called neutral bremsstrahlung); it is systemically studied here both\ntheoretically and experimentally. In particular, the absolute EL yield has for\nthe first time been measured in pure gaseous argon in the two-phase mode, using\na dedicated two-phase detector with EL gap optically read out by cryogenic PMTs\nand SiPMs. We show that the neutral bremsstrahlung effect can explain two\nintriguing observations in EL radiation: that of the substantial contribution\nof the non-VUV spectral component, extending from the UV to NIR, and that of\nthe photon emission at lower electric fields, below the Ar excitation\nthreshold. Possible applications of neutral bremsstrahlung effect in two-phase\ndark matter detectors are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 11:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 05:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 07:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

The potential energy surface employed is a many-body representation\nup to three-body terms, in which monomers and two-body interactions are\ndescribed by the high level Wang-Huang-Braams-Bowman (WHBB) water potential,\nwhile, for three-body interactions, calculations adopt a fast permutationally\ninvariant ab initio surface at the same level of theory of the WHBB 3-body\npotential. Applications range from the water dimer up to the water decamer, a\nsystem made of 84 vibrational degrees of freedom. Results are generally in\nagreement with previous variational estimates in the literature. This is\nparticularly true for the bending and the high-frequency stretching motions,\nwhile estimates of modes strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding are red\nshifted, in a few instances even substantially, as a consequence of the\ndynamical and global picture provided by the semiclassical approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 14:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}
