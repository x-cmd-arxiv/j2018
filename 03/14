Since manual anno- tation su ers limited\nreproducibility, arduous e orts, and excessive time, automatic segmentation is\ndesired to process increasingly larger scale histopathological data. Recently,\ndeep neural networks (DNNs), par- ticularly fully convolutional networks\n(FCNs), have been widely applied to biomedical image segmenta- tion, attaining\nmuch improved performance. At the same time, quantization of DNNs has become an\nac- tive research topic, which aims to represent weights with less memory\n(precision) to considerably reduce memory and computation requirements of DNNs\nwhile maintaining acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we apply quantization\ntechniques to FCNs for accurate biomedical image segmentation. Unlike existing\nlitera- ture on quantization which primarily targets memory and computation\ncomplexity reduction, we apply quan- tization as a method to reduce over tting\nin FCNs for better accuracy. Speci cally, we focus on a state-of- the-art\nsegmentation framework, suggestive annotation [22], which judiciously extracts\nrepresentative annota- tion samples from the original training dataset, obtain-\ning an e ective small-sized balanced training dataset. We develop two new\nquantization processes for this framework: (1) suggestive annotation with\nquantiza- tion for highly representative training samples, and (2) network\ntraining with quantization for high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the\nMICCAI Gland dataset show that both quantization processes can improve the\nsegmentation performance, and our proposed method exceeds the current\nstate-of-the-art performance by up to 1%. In addition, our method has a\nreduction of up to 6.4x on memory usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 16:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Therefore, within supervised machine learning, heavy\nuse is made of ridge regression (i.e., L2 regularization), which requires the\nthe estimation of hyperparameters and can be rendered ineffective by certain\nmodel parameterizations.

In this paper we propose a simple and inexpensive novel strategy\nto prevent the HLLC scheme from developing such spurious solutions without\ncompromising on its linear wave resolution ability. The cure is primarily based\non a reinterpretation of the HLLC scheme as a combination of its well-known\ndiffusive counterpart, the HLL scheme, and an antidiffusive term responsible\nfor its accuracy on linear wavefields. In our study, a linear analysis of this\nalternate form indicates that shock instability in the HLLC scheme could be\ntriggered due to the unwanted activation of the antidiffusive terms of its mass\nand interface-normal flux components on interfaces that are not aligned with\nthe shock front. This inadvertent activation results in weakening of the\nfavourable dissipation provided by its inherent HLL scheme and causes\nunphysical mass flux variations along the shock front. To mitigate this, we\npropose a modified HLLC scheme that employs a simple differentiable pressure\nbased multidimensional shock sensor to achieve smooth control of these critical\nantidiffusive terms near shocks. Using a linear perturbation analysis and a\nmatrix based stability analysis, we establish that the resulting scheme, called\nHLLC-ADC (Anti-Diffusion Control), is shock stable over a wide range of\nfreestream Mach numbers. Results from standard numerical test cases demonstrate\nthat the HLLC-ADC scheme is indeed free from the most common manifestations of\nshock instability including the Carbuncle phenomenon without significant loss\nof accuracy on shear dominated viscous flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 17:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

For each system in this sample, we measure dM/dt using archival\nChandra X-ray data and acquire the SFR and systematic uncertainty in the SFR by\ncombining over 330 estimates from dozens of literature sources. With these\ndata, we estimate the efficiency with which the ICM cools and forms stars,\nfinding e_cool = SFR/(dM/dt) = 1.4 +/- 0.4% for systems with dM/dt > 30\nMsun/yr. For these systems, we measure a slope in the SFR-dM/dt relation\ngreater than unity, suggesting that the systems with the strongest cool cores\nare also cooling more efficiently. We propose that this may be related to, on\naverage, higher black hole accretion rates in the strongest cool cores, which\ncould influence the total amount (saturating near the Eddington rate) and\ndominant mode (mechanical vs radiative) of feedback. For systems with dM/dt <\n30 Msun/yr, we find that the SFR and dM/dt are uncorrelated, and show that this\nis consistent with star formation being fueled at a low (but dominant) level by\nrecycled ISM gas in these systems. We find an intrinsic log-normal scatter in\nSFR at fixed dM/dt of 0.52 +/- 0.06 dex, suggesting that cooling is tightly\nself-regulated over very long timescales, but can vary dramatically on short\ntimescales. There is weak evidence that this scatter may be related to the\nfeedback mechanism, with the scatter being minimized (~0.4 dex) in systems for\nwhich the mechanical feedback power is within a factor of two of the cooling\nluminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

The absence of oscillatory supercurrent originates from the fact that\nstrain-induced gauge fields have opposite directions at the two valleys due to\nthe time-reversal symmetry.

Matched filters can leverage knowledge of\nthe source structure and kinematics to increase sensitivity of spectral line\nobservations. Application of the filter in the native Fourier domain improves\nSNR while simultaneously avoiding the computational cost and ambiguities\nassociated with imaging, making matched filtering a fast and robust method for\nweak spectral line detection.

Typically, the computational cost of evaluating whether an edge\nof the roadmap graph is collision-free dominates the running time of search\nalgorithms. Algorithms such as Lazy Weighted A* (LWA*) and LazySP have been\nproposed to reduce the number of edge evaluations by employing a lazy lookahead\n(one-step lookahead and infinite-step lookahead, respectively). However, this\ncomes at the expense of additional graph operations: the larger the lookahead,\nthe more the graph operations that are typically required. We propose Lazy\nReceding-Horizon A* (LRA*) to minimize the total planning time by balancing\nedge evaluations and graph operations. Endowed with a lazy lookahead, LRA*\nrepresents a family of lazy shortest-path graph-search algorithms that\ngeneralizes LWA* and LazySP. We analyze the theoretic properties of LRA* and\ndemonstrate empirically that, in many cases, to minimize the total planning\ntime, the algorithm requires an intermediate lazy lookahead.

Progressive diseases often\nstart with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis, and each patient\nfollows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability,\nwhich can be associated with many factors such as genotype, age, or sex. An\nadditional layer of complexity is that, in real life, the amount and type of\ndata available for each patient can differ significantly. For example, for one\npatient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might\nhave detailed clinical assessments obtained at multiple prior time-points. This\npaper presents a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities\n(including images and clinical assessments) and variable patient histories with\nirregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical scores at future\ntime-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression,\nwhich gives rise to clinical observations in our generative model.

Such\nfailures can propagate and destabilize the entire power system, potentially\nleading to widespread outages. One approach to mitigate impending cascading\nfailures is through controlled islanding, in which a set of transmission lines\nis deliberately tripped to partition the unstable system into several disjoint,\ninternally stable islands. Selecting such a set of transmission lines is\ninherently a combinatorial optimization problem. Current approaches address\nthis problem in two steps: first classify coherent generators into groups and\nthen separate generator groups into different islands with minimal\nload-generation imbalance. These methods, however, are based on computationally\nexpensive heuristics that do not provide optimality guarantees.

An\noutstanding question is whether the inferred paleofields represent the\nbackground magnetic field of the solar nebula or were unique to the\nchondrule-forming environment. We investigate the amplification of the magnetic\nfield above background values for two proposed chondrule formation mechanisms,\nlarge-scale nebular shocks and planetary bow shocks. Behind large-scale shocks,\nthe magnetic field parallel to the shock front is amplified by factors $\\sim\n10-30$, regardless of the magnetic diffusivity. Therefore, chondrules melted in\nthese shocks probably recorded an amplified magnetic field. Behind planetary\nbow shocks, the field amplification is sensitive to the magnetic diffusivity.\nWe compute the gas properties behind a bow shock around a 3000 km-radius\nplanetary embryo, with and without atmospheres, using hydrodynamics models. We\ncalculate the ionization state of the hot, shocked gas, including thermionic\nemission from dust, and thermal ionization of gas-phase potassium atoms, and\nthe magnetic diffusivity due to Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion. We\nfind that the diffusivity is sufficiently large that magnetic fields have\nalready relaxed to background values in the shock downstream where chondrules\nacquire magnetizations, and that these locations are sufficiently far from the\nplanetary embryos that chondrules should not have recorded a significant\nputative dynamo field generated on these bodies.

PageRank,\ntogether with many of its random walk based variants, has become one of the\nmost well-known and widely used algorithms, due to its mathematical elegance\nand the superior performance across a variety of application domains.

In this paper, we argue that work to date has\naddressed a problem that is relatively ill-posed. Specifically, there is not\nuniversal agreement about what constitutes a salient object when multiple\nobservers are queried. This implies that some objects are more likely to be\njudged salient than others, and implies a relative rank exists on salient\nobjects. The solution presented in this paper solves this more general problem\nthat considers relative rank, and we propose data and metrics suitable to\nmeasuring success in a relative object saliency landscape. A novel deep\nlearning solution is proposed based on a hierarchical representation of\nrelative saliency and stage-wise refinement. We also show that the problem of\nsalient object subitizing can be addressed with the same network, and our\napproach exceeds performance of any prior work across all metrics considered\n(both traditional and newly proposed).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 00:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 14:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-26"}

Our algorithms are interactive in nature, i.e., instead of\noutputting a model based on the training data, they provide predictions for a\nset of $m$ feature vectors that arrive online. We show that, for the feature\nvectors on which an ensemble of models (trained on random disjoint subsets of a\ndataset) makes consistent predictions, there is almost no-cost of privacy in\ngenerating accurate predictions for those feature vectors. To that end, we\nprovide a novel coupling of the distance to instability framework with the\nsparse vector technique. We provide algorithms with formal privacy and utility\nguarantees for both binary/multi-class classification, and soft-label\nclassification. For binary classification in the standard (agnostic) PAC model,\nwe show how to bootstrap from our privately generated predictions to construct\na computationally efficient private learner that outputs a final accurate\nhypothesis. Our construction - to the best of our knowledge - is the first\ncomputationally efficient construction for a label-private learner. We prove\nsample complexity upper bounds for this setting. As in non-private sample\ncomplexity bounds, the only relevant property of the given concept class is its\nVC dimension. For soft-label classification, our techniques are based on\nexploiting the stability properties of traditional learning algorithms, like\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD). We provide a new technique to boost the\naverage-case stability properties of learning algorithms to strong (worst-case)\nstability properties, and then exploit them to obtain private classification\nalgorithms.

In this article,\nto determine the tail state generation in various solar cell materials, we have\ndeveloped a quite general theoretical scheme in which the experimental Urbach\nenergy is compared with the absorption edge energy derived from density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculation. For this purpose, the absorption spectra\nof solar cell materials, including CdTe, CuInSe2 (CISe), CuGaSe2 (CGSe),\nCu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and hybrid perovskites, have been\ncalculated by DFT particularly using very-high-density k meshes. As a result,\nwe find that the tail state formation is negligible in CdTe, CISe, CGSe and\nhybrid perovskite polycrystals. However, coevaporated CZTSe and CZTS layers\nexhibit very large Urbach energies, which are far larger than the theoretical\ncounterparts. Based on DFT analysis results, we conclude that the quite large\ntail state formation observed in the CZTSe and CZTS originates from extensive\ncation disordering.

A series of defending\nmethods, either proactive defence or reactive defence, have been proposed in\nthe recent years. However, most of the methods can only handle specific\nattacks. For example, proactive defending methods are invalid against grey-box\nor white-box attacks, while reactive defending methods are challenged by\nlow-distortion adversarial examples or transferring adversarial examples. This\nbecomes a critical problem since a defender usually does not have the type of\nthe attack as a priori knowledge. Moreover, existing two-pronged defences\n(e.g., MagNet), which take advantages of both proactive and reactive methods,\nhave been reported as broken under transferring attacks. To address this\nproblem, this paper proposed a novel defensive framework based on collaborative\nmulti-task training, aiming at providing defence for different types of\nattacks. The proposed defence first encodes training labels into label pairs\nand counters black-box attacks leveraging adversarial training supervised by\nthe encoded label pairs. The defence further constructs a detector to identify\nand reject high-confidence adversarial examples that bypass the black-box\ndefence. In addition, the proposed collaborative architecture can prevent\nadversaries from finding valid adversarial examples when the defence strategy\nis exposed. In the experiments, we evaluated our defence against four\nstate-of-the-art attacks on $MNIST$ and $CIFAR10$ datasets. The results showed\nthat our defending method achieved up to $96.3\\%$ classification accuracy on\nblack-box adversarial examples, and detected up to $98.7\\%$ of the high\nconfidence adversarial examples.

Manually crafting these features usually comes with high cost due to\nthe variety, volume and velocity of raw data in web-scale systems.\nFactorization based models, which measure interactions in terms of vector\nproduct, can learn patterns of combinatorial features automatically and\ngeneralize to unseen features as well. With the great success of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) in various fields, recently researchers have proposed several\nDNN-based factorization model to learn both low- and high-order feature\ninteractions. Despite the powerful ability of learning an arbitrary function\nfrom data, plain DNNs generate feature interactions implicitly and at the\nbit-wise level. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressed Interaction\nNetwork (CIN), which aims to generate feature interactions in an explicit\nfashion and at the vector-wise level. We show that the CIN share some\nfunctionalities with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs).

It can represent, for example, a system with particles that have a\nself-propulsion mechanism. Each node of the network specifies a possible\nlocation of a particle, and its orientation. The orientation (which is formally\nlike a spin degree of freedom) determines the self-propulsion direction. The\nbonds represent the possibility to make transitions: to hop between locations;\nor to switch the orientation. In systems of experimental interest (Janus\nparticles), the self-propulsion is induced by illumination. An emergent aspect\nis the topological stochastic disorder (TSD). It is implied by the\nnon-uniformity of the illumination. In technical terms the TSD reflects the\nlocal non-zero circulations (affinities) of the stochastic transitions. This\ntype of disorder, unlike non-homogeneous magnetic field, is non-hermitian, and\ncan lead to the emergence of a complex relaxation spectrum. It is therefore\ndramatically distinct from the conservative Anderson-type or Sinai-type\ndisorder. We discuss the consequences of having TSD.

The physics of this transition is not\nconventional and involves a multiband Peierls instability with strong interband\ncoupling. This CDW ground state is readily destroyed with femtosecond laser\npulses resulting in a light-induced insulator-to-metal phase transition.

Residual convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown\npotential for removing artifacts caused by data undersampling. In this study we\ninvestigated the effect of different radial sampling patterns on the accuracy\nof a CNN. We also acquired actual real-time undersampled radial data in\npatients with congenital heart disease (CHD), and compare CNN reconstruction to\nCompressed Sensing (CS).\n  METHODS: A 3D (2D plus time) CNN architecture was developed, and trained\nusing 2276 gold-standard paired 3D data sets, with 14x radial undersampling.\nFour sampling schemes were tested, using 169 previously unseen 3D 'synthetic'\ntest data sets. Actual real-time tiny Golden Angle (tGA) radial SSFP data was\nacquired in 10 new patients (122 3D data sets), and reconstructed using the 3D\nCNN as well as a CS algorithm; GRASP.\n  RESULTS: Sampling pattern was shown to be important for image quality, and\naccurate visualisation of cardiac structures. For actual real-time data,\noverall reconstruction time with CNN (including creation of aliased images) was\nshown to be more than 5x faster than GRASP. Additionally, CNN image quality and\naccuracy of biventricular volumes was observed to be superior to GRASP for the\nsame raw data.\n  CONCLUSION: This paper has demonstrated the potential for the use of a 3D CNN\nfor deep de-aliasing of real-time radial data, within the clinical setting.\nClinical measures of ventricular volumes using real-time data with CNN\nreconstruction are not statistically significantly different from the\ngold-standard, cardiac gated, BH techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 10:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 21:27:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 13:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

We consider a weakly nonlinear\ncase governed by a quadratic nonlinearity, and also analyse the fully nonlinear\nequations of motion. We treat the prominence as a massive line current located\nabove the photosphere and interacting with the magnetised dipped environment\nvia the Lorentz force. In this concept the magnetic dip is produced by two\nexternal current sources located at the photosphere. Finite amplitude\nhorizontal and vertical oscillations are found to be strongly coupled between\neach other. The coupling is more efficient for larger amplitudes and smaller\nattack angles between the direction of the driver and the horizontal axis.\nSpatial structure of oscillations is represented by Lissajous-like curves with\nthe limit cycle of a hourglass shape, appearing in the resonant case, when the\nfrequency of the vertical mode is twice the horizontal mode frequency. A\nmetastable equilibrium of the prominence is revealed, which is stable for small\namplitude displacements, and becomes horizontally unstable, when the amplitude\nexceeds a threshold value. The maximum oscillation amplitudes are also\nanalytically derived and analysed.

The main new effects\nof the finite amplitude are the coupling of the horizontally and vertically\npolarised transverse oscillations (i.e. the lack of a simple, elliptically\npolarised regime) and the presence of metastable equilibria of prominences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 10:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

This\nimprovement in reconstruction quality is attributed to the principled way we\ndesign our network architecture, which also requires fewer trainable parameters\nthan the current state-of-the-art deep network solution. Finally, we show that\nour network has the ability to generalize well even when it is trained on small\ndatasets, while keeping the overall number of trainable parameters low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 11:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 10:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 13:55:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 07:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

Here we apply metric space analysis to explore the\ntransitions between the several phases in spin imbalanced systems. In\nparticular we investigate the so-called FFLO (Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov)\nphase, which is an intriguing phenomenon in which superconductivity and\nmagnetism coexist in the same material. This is expected to appear for example\nin attractive fermionic systems with spin-imbalanced populations, due to the\ninternal polarization produced by the imbalance. The transition between FFLO\nphase (superconducting phase) and the normal phase (non-superconducting) and\ntheir boundaries have been subject of discussion in recent years. We consider\nthe Hubbard model in the attractive regime for which Density Matrix\nRenormalization Group calculations allow us to obtain the exact density\nfunction of the system. We then analyze the exact density distances as a\nfunction of the polarization. We find that our distances display signatures of\nthe distinct quantum phases in spin-imbalanced fermionic systems: with respect\nto a central reference polarization, systems without FFLO present a very\nsymmetric behavior, while systems with phase transitions are asymmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 11:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

We formulate and study a mean-field\ngame model whose behavior mimics an empirically derived non-local homogeneous\nflocking model for agents with gradient self-propulsion dynamics. The\nmean-field game framework provides a non-cooperative optimal control\ndescription of the behavior of a population of agents in a distributed setting.\nIn this description, each agent's state is driven by optimally controlled\ndynamics that result in a Nash equilibrium between itself and the population.\nThe optimal control is computed by minimizing a cost that depends only on its\nown state, and a mean-field term. The agent distribution in phase space evolves\nunder the optimal feedback control policy. We exploit the low-rank perturbative\nnature of the non-local term in the forward-backward system of equations\ngoverning the state and control distributions, and provide a linear stability\nanalysis demonstrating that our model exhibits bifurcations similar to those\nfound in the empirical model. The present work is a step towards developing a\nset of tools for systematic analysis, and eventually design, of collective\nbehavior of non-cooperative dynamic agents via an inverse modeling approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 13:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 17:11:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 16:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

The characterization of\nsuch free energetics is typically performed using enhanced sampling techniques\nsuch as umbrella sampling. In umbrella sampling, order parameter distributions\nobtained from adjacent biased simulations must overlap in order to estimate\nfree energy differences between biased ensembles. Many biased simulations are\ntypically required to ensure such overlap, which exacts a steep computational\ncost. We recently introduced a sparse sampling method, which circumvents the\noverlap requirement by using thermodynamic integration to estimate free energy\ndifferences between biased ensembles. Here we build upon and generalize sparse\nsampling for characterizing the free energetics of water density fluctuations\nin systems near liquid-vapor coexistence. We also introduce sensible heuristics\nfor choosing the biasing potential parameters and strategies for adaptively\nrefining them, which facilitate the estimation of such free energetics\naccurately and efficiently. We illustrate the method by characterizing the free\nenergetics of cavitation in a large volume in bulk water. We also use sparse\nsampling to characterize the free energetics of capillary evaporation for water\nconfined between two hydrophobic plates. In both cases, sparse sampling is\nnearly two orders of magnitude faster than umbrella sampling. Given its\nefficiency, the sparse sampling method is particularly well suited for\ncharacterizing free energy landscapes for systems wherein umbrella sampling is\nprohibitively expensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 13:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

Meanwhile, in\nmany classification problems, the label function may vary abruptly in certain\ngraph regions, resulting in high-frequency components. Although the\nsemi-supervised estimation of class labels is an ill-posed problem in general,\nin several applications it is possible to find a source graph on which the\nlabel function has similar frequency content to that on the target graph where\nthe actual classification problem is defined. In this paper, we propose a\nmethod for domain adaptation on graphs motivated by these observations. Our\nalgorithm is based on learning the spectrum of the label function in a source\ngraph with many labeled nodes, and transferring the information of the spectrum\nto the target graph with fewer labeled nodes. While the frequency content of\nthe class label function can be identified through the graph Fourier transform,\nit is not easy to transfer the Fourier coefficients directly between the two\ngraphs, since no one-to-one match exists between the Fourier basis vectors of\nindependently constructed graphs in the domain adaptation setting. We solve\nthis problem by learning a transformation between the Fourier bases of the two\ngraphs that flexibly ``aligns'' them. The unknown class label function on the\ntarget graph is then reconstructed such that its spectrum matches that on the\nsource graph while also ensuring the consistency with the available labels.

The dust continuum emission\nhas been resolved into two cores namely Main and NE. The Main core, which has\nthe stronger emission and is the more chemically rich, has a diameter of ~5300\nau, and is associated with two free-free continuum sources. The Main core looks\nfeatureless and homogeneous in dust continuum emission and does not present any\nhint of fragmentation. Each transition of CH3CN and CH3OCHO, both ground and\nvibrationally excited, as well as those of CH3CN isotopologues, shows a clear\nvelocity gradient along the NE-SW direction, with velocity linearly increasing\nwith distance from the center, consistent with solid-body rotation. However,\nwhen comparing the velocity field of transitions with different upper level\nenergies, the rotation velocity increases with increasing energy of the\ntransition, which suggests that the rotation speeds up towards the center.\nSpectral lines towards the dust continuum peak show an inverse P-Cygni profile\nthat supports the existence of infall in the core. The infall velocity\nincreases with the energy of the transition suggesting that the infall is\naccelerating towards the center of the core, consistent with gravitational\ncollapse. Despite the monolithic appearance of the Main core, the presence of\nred-shifted absorption, the existence of two embedded free-free sources at the\ncenter, and the rotational spin-up are consistent with an unstable core\nundergoing fragmentation with infall and differential rotation due to\nconservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the most likely explanation for\nthe monolithic morphology is that the large opacity of the dust emission\nprevents the detection of any inhomogeneity in the core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 14:21:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 11:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

These maps have unveiled a rich resonant\nstructure involving two or three planets, as well as indicating possible\nmigration routes from secular to double resonances or pure 3-planet\ncommensurabilities. These structures are then compared to the present-day\norbital architecture of observed resonant chains. In a second part of the paper\nwe describe N-body simulations of type-I migration. Depending on the orbital\ndecay timescale, we show that 3-planet systems may be trapped in different\ncombinations of independent commensurabilities: (i) double resonances, (ii)\nintersection between a 2-planet and a first-order 3-planet resonance, and (iii)\nsimultaneous libration in two first-order 3-planet resonances. These latter\noutcomes are found for slow migrations, while double resonances are almost\nalways the final outcome in high-density disks. Finally, we discuss an\napplication to the TRAPPIST-1 system. We find that, for low migration rates and\nplanetary masses of the order of the estimated values, most 3-planet\nsub-systems are able to reach the observed double resonances after following\nevolutionary routes defined by pure 3-planet resonances. The final orbital\nconfiguration shows resonance offsets comparable with present-day values\nwithout the need of tidal dissipation. For the 8/5 resonance proposed to\ndominate the dynamics of the two inner planets, we find little evidence of its\ndynamical significance; instead, we propose that this relation between mean\nmotions could be a consequence of the interaction between a pure 3-planet\nresonance and a 2-planet commensurability between planets c and d.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 14:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

The low-energy dynamics of NG\nbosons is governed by the underlying spontaneously broken symmetry, which\nlikewise allows one to bypass the Lagrangian and connect the scaling of the\nscattering amplitudes directly to the Lie algebra of the symmetry generators.\nWe focus on theories with enhanced soft limits, where the scattering amplitudes\nscale with a higher power of momentum than expected based on the mere existence\nof Adler's zero.

Namely, for compact internal\nsymmetry groups, all NG bosons featuring enhanced soft limits necessarily\nbelong to the center of the group. For noncompact symmetry groups such as the\nISO($n$) group featured by some multi-Galileon theories, these NG bosons then\nnecessarily belong to an Abelian normal subgroup.

For\nexample, a request may be to establish a virtual circuit, thus contributing to\nthe load on each edge in the circuit.

UML as a visual language can tremendously help\ncustomers, project managers, and developers to specify the requirements of a\ntarget system. However, UML lacks the ability to specify the requirements\nprecisely such as the contracts of the system operation, and verify the\nconsistency and refinement of the requirements. These disadvantages result in\nthat the potential faults of software are hard to be discovered in the early\nstage of software development process, and then requiring more efforts in\nsoftware testing to find the bugs. Service refinement is a formal method, which\ncould be a supplement to enhance the UML. In this paper, we show how to\nintegrate UML with service refinement to specify requirements, and verify the\nconsistency and refinements of the requirements through a case study of online\nshopping system. Particularly, requirements are modeled through UML diagrams,\nwhich includes a) use case diagram, b) system sequence diagrams and c)\nconceptual class diagram. Service refinement enhances the requirements model by\nintroducing the contracts. Furthermore, the consistency and refinements of\nrequirement model can be verified through service refinement. Our approach\ndemonstrates integrating UML with service refinement can require fewer efforts\nto achieve the consistency requirements than only using UML for requirement\nmodeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 15:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

For a mesoscopic system, by definition, the size\nand the contacts with other systems influence its thermodynamic properties and\ntherefore, if we define an entropy, this cannot be a homogeneous of order one\nfunction in the extensive variables.

The timetable will be released to the public if determined and it would\nnot be influenced by OD demands. Typically, the total capacity of scheduled\ntrains can usually satisfy the predicted demands of express cargos in average.\nHowever, the demands are changing in practice. Therefore, how to distribute the\nshipments between different stations to unscheduled and scheduled train\nservices has become an important research field in railway transportation. This\npaper focuses on the coordinated optimization of the rail express cargos\ndistribution in two service networks. On the premise of fully utilizing the\ncapacity of scheduled service network first, we established a Car-to-Train\n(CTT) assignment model to assign rail express cargos to scheduled and\nunscheduled trains scientifically. The objective function is to maximize the\nnet income of transporting the rail express cargos. The constraints include the\ncapacity restriction on the service arcs, flow balance constraints, logical\nrelationship constraint between two groups of decision variables and the due\ndate constraint. The last constraint is to ensure that the total transportation\ntime of a shipment would not be longer than its predefined due date. Finally,\nwe discuss the linearization techniques to simplify the model proposed in this\npaper, which make it possible for obtaining global optimal solution by using\nthe commercial software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 07:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

However, prior works mainly\nrely on directly tuning parameters like compression rate, to blindly reduce\nimage features, thereby lacking guarantee on both defense efficiency (i.e.\naccuracy of polluted images) and classification accuracy of benign images,\nafter applying defense methods. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nJPEG-based defensive compression framework, namely \"feature distillation\", to\neffectively rectify adversarial examples without impacting classification\naccuracy on benign data. Our framework significantly escalates the defense\nefficiency with marginal accuracy reduction using a two-step method: First, we\nmaximize malicious features filtering of adversarial input perturbations by\ndeveloping defensive quantization in frequency domain of JPEG compression or\ndecompression, guided by a semi-analytical method; Second, we suppress the\ndistortions of benign features to restore classification accuracy through a\nDNN-oriented quantization refine process.

In\nmomentum space the reaction amplitude factorizes into a product of projectile\nand target transition form factors, folded with the nucleon-nucleon isovector\ninteraction and a distortion coefficient which accounts for initial and final\nstate ion-ion elastic interactions. The multipole structure of the transition\nform factors is studied in detail for Fermi-type non-spin flip and\nGamow-Teller-type spin flip transitions, also serving to establish the\nconnection to nuclear beta decay. The reaction kernel is evaluated for central\nand rank-2 tensor interactions.

In that limit the\ndistortion coefficient is evaluated in closed form, revealing the relation to\nthe total reaction cross section and the geometry of the transition form\nfactors.

Unfortunately, the ever-increasing size of LSTM model leads to\ninefficient designs on FPGAs due to the limited on-chip resources. The previous\nwork proposes to use a pruning based compression technique to reduce the model\nsize and thus speedups the inference on FPGAs. However, the random nature of\nthe pruning technique transforms the dense matrices of the model to highly\nunstructured sparse ones, which leads to unbalanced computation and irregular\nmemory accesses and thus hurts the overall performance and energy efficiency.\n  In contrast, we propose to use a structured compression technique which could\nnot only reduce the LSTM model size but also eliminate the irregularities of\ncomputation and memory accesses. This approach employs block-circulant instead\nof sparse matrices to compress weight matrices and reduces the storage\nrequirement from $\\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(k)$. Fast Fourier Transform\nalgorithm is utilized to further accelerate the inference by reducing the\ncomputational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(k\\text{log}k)$. The datapath and activation functions are\nquantized as 16-bit to improve the resource utilization. More importantly, we\npropose a comprehensive framework called C-LSTM to automatically optimize and\nimplement a wide range of LSTM variants on FPGAs. According to the experimental\nresults, C-LSTM achieves up to 18.8X and 33.5X gains for performance and energy\nefficiency compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM implementation under the\nsame experimental setup, and the accuracy degradation is very small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 04:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

We investigate in an intermediate-complexity climate\nmodel the applicability of linear response theory (LRT) to the assessment of a\ngeoengineering method. This application of LRT is twofold. First, our objective\n(O1) is to assess only the best possible geoengineering scenario by looking for\na suitable modulation of solar forcing that can cancel out or otherwise\nmodulate a climate change signal resulting from a rise in CO2 alone. Here we\nconsider only the cancellation of the expected global mean surface air\ntemperature. It is a straightforward inverse problem for this solar forcing,\nand, considering an infinite time period, we use LRT to provide the solution in\nthe frequency domain in closed form. We provide procedures suitable for\nnumerical implementation that apply to finite time periods too. Second, to be\nable to use LRT to quantify side-effects, the response with respect to\nuncontrolled observables, such as regional must be approximately linear. Our\nobjective (O2) here is to assess the linearity of the response. We find that\nunder geoengineering in the sense of (O1) the asymptotic response of the\nglobally averaged temperature is actually not zero. This is due to an\ninaccurate determination of the linear susceptibilities. The error is due to a\nsignificant quadratic nonlinearity of the response. This nonlinear contribution\ncan be easily removed, which results in much better estimates of the linear\nsusceptibility, and, in turn, in a fivefold reduction in the global average\nsurface temperature under geoengineering. This correction dramatically improves\nalso the agreement of the spatial patterns of the predicted and of the true\nresponse.
