While it is\nrecognized that thymic cells are 'audited' to optimize an organism's immune\nrepertoire, whether gametogenesis could be orchestrated similarly to favour\nhigh quality gametes is uncertain. Ideally, such quality would be affirmed at\nearly stages before the commitment of extensive parental resources. A case is\nhere made that, along the lines of a previously proposed lymphocyte quality\ncontrol mechanism, gamete quality can be registered indirectly through\ndetection of incompatibilities between proteins encoded by the grandparental\nDNA sequences within the parent from which haploid gametes are meiotically\nderived. This 'stress test' is achieved in the same way that thymic screening\nfor potential immunological incompatibilities is achieved - by 'promiscuous'\nexpression, under the influence of the AIRE protein, of the products of genes\nthat are not normally specific for that organ. Consistent with this, the Aire\ngene is expressed in both thymus and gonads, and AIRE deficiency impedes\nfunction in both organs. While not excluding the subsequent emergence of hybrid\nincompatibilities due to the intermixing of genomic sequences from parents\n(rather than grandparents), many observations, such as the number of proteins\nthat are aberrantly expressed during gametogenesis, can be explained on this\nbasis. Indeed, promiscuous expression could have first evolved in\ngamete-forming cells where incompatible proteins would be manifest as aberrant\nprotein aggregates that cause apoptosis. This mechanism would later have been\nco-opted by thymic epithelial cells which display peptides from aggregates to\nremove potentially autoreactive T cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 16:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 17:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

The originality of this work resides in that this new notion\nof hypercontractivity is given in terms of the so-called amalgamated\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$ norms introduced recently by Junge and Parcet in the context of\noperator spaces theory. We make three main contributions. The first one is a\nversion of Gross' integration lemma: we prove that (weak) HC implies (weak)\nLSI. Surprisingly, the converse implication differs from the primitive case as\nwe show that LSI implies HC but with a weak constant equal to the cardinal of\nthe center of the decoherence-free algebra. Building on the first implication,\nour second contribution is the fact that strong LSI and therefore strong HC do\nnot hold for non-trivially primitive QMS. This implies that the amalgamated\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$ norms are not uniformly convex for $1\\leq p \\leq 2$. As a third\ncontribution, we derive universal bounds on the (weak) logarithmic Sobolev\nconstants for a QMS on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, using a similar\nmethod as Diaconis and Saloff-Coste in the case of classical primitive Markov\nchains, and Temme, Pastawski and Kastoryano in the case of primitive QMS. This\nleads to new bounds on the decoherence rates of decohering QMS. Additionally,\nwe apply our results to the study of the tensorization of HC in non-commutative\nspaces in terms of the completely bounded norms (CB norms) recently introduced\nby Beigi and King for unital and trace preserving QMS.

We further expanded our framework to extract parameters of diffusion\nfor the sulfur vacancies and analyzed transition probabilities associated with\nswitching between different configurations of defect complexes consisting of Mo\ndopant and sulfur vacancy, providing insight into point defect dynamics and\nreactions.

A major concern over the use of response-adaptive designs in\npractice, particularly from a regulatory viewpoint, is controlling the type I\nerror rate. In particular, we show that the naive z-test can have an inflated\ntype I error rate even after applying a Bonferroni correction. Simulation\nstudies have often been used to demonstrate error control, but do not provide a\nguarantee. In this paper, we present adaptive testing procedures for normally\ndistributed outcomes that ensure strong familywise error control, by\niteratively applying the conditional invariance principle.

In order to resolve this problem, a minimum of two\nsensor acquisitions, separated by a baseline and extended in the\ncross-slant-range, are needed. However, given its multi-temporal nature, these\ntechniques are vulnerable to atmosphere and Earth environment parameters\nvariation in addition to physical platform instabilities.

Specific forms of binary neural\nnetworks (BNNs) and stochastic computing based neural networks (SCNNs) are\nparticularly appealing to hardware implementations since they can be\nimplemented almost entirely with binary operations.

In order to address these\nconcerns, in this paper we prove that the \"ideal\" SCNNs and BNNs satisfy the\nuniversal approximation property with probability 1 (due to the stochastic\nbehavior). The proof is conducted by first proving the property for SCNNs from\nthe strong law of large numbers, and then using SCNNs as a \"bridge\" to prove\nfor BNNs. Based on the universal approximation property, we further prove that\nSCNNs and BNNs exhibit the same energy complexity. In other words, they have\nthe same asymptotic energy consumption with the growing of network size.

The amount of memory required to represent these games is the main\nbottleneck of algorithms for computing optimal strategies and the size of these\nstrategies is often impractical for real-world applications. A common approach\nto tackle the memory bottleneck is to use information abstraction that removes\nparts of information available to players thus reducing the number of decision\npoints in the game. However, existing information-abstraction techniques are\neither specific for a particular domain, they do not provide any quality\nguarantees, or they are applicable to very small subclasses of EFGs. We present\ndomain-independent abstraction methods for creating imperfect recall\nabstractions in extensive-form games that allow computing strategies that are\n(near) optimal in the original game. To this end, we introduce two novel\nalgorithms, FPIRA and CFR+IRA, based on fictitious play and counterfactual\nregret minimization. These algorithms can start with an arbitrary domain\nspecific, or the coarsest possible, abstraction of the original game. The\nalgorithms iteratively detect the missing information they require for\ncomputing a strategy for the abstract game that is (near) optimal in the\noriginal game. This information is then included back into the abstract game.\nMoreover, our algorithms are able to exploit imperfect-recall abstractions that\nallow players to forget even history of their own actions. However, the\nalgorithms require traversing the complete unabstracted game tree. We\nexperimentally show that our algorithms can closely approximate Nash\nequilibrium of large games using abstraction with as little as 0.9% of\ninformation sets of the original game. Moreover, the results suggest that\nmemory savings increase with the increasing size of the original games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 16:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 17:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

Accretion disc boundary layer\nis locally represented by incompressible homogeneous and boundless flow of the\ncyclonic type, which is linearly stable. Its non-linear instability at the\nshear rates of order of the rotational frequency remains an issue. We argue\nthat hydrodynamical subcritical turbulence in such a flow is sustained by the\nnon-linear feedback from essentially three-dimensional vortices, which are\ngenerated by quasi-two-dimensional trailing shearing spirals grown to high\namplitude via the swing amplification. We refer to those three-dimensional\nvortices as cross-rolls, since they are aligned in the shearwise direction in\ncontrast to streamwise rolls generated by the anti-lift-up mechanism in\nrotating shear flow on the Rayleigh line. Transient growth of cross-rolls is\nstudied analytically and further confronted with direct numerical simulations\n(DNS) of dynamics of non-linear erturbations. DNS performed in a tall box show\nthat transition Reynolds number $R_T$ as function of shear rate accords with\nthe line of constant maximum transient growth of cross-rolls. The transition in\nthe tall box has been observed until the shear rate three times higher than the\nrotational frequency, when $R_T\\sim 50000$. Assuming that the cross-rolls are\nalso responsible for turbulence in the Keplerian flow, we estimate $R_T\\lesssim\n10^8$ in this case.

The conventional approach is to treat integer data as real, and then\napply real-valued factorizations. However, doing so fails to preserve important\ncharacteristics of the original data, thereby making it hard to interpret the\nresults. Instead, our approach extracts factor values from integer datasets as\nscores that are constrained to take values from a small integer set. These\nscores are easy to interpret: a score of zero indicates no feature contribution\nand higher scores indicate distinct levels of feature importance.\n  At its core, SUSTain relies on: a) a problem partitioning into\ninteger-constrained subproblems, so that they can be optimally solved in an\nefficient manner; and b) organizing the order of the subproblems' solution, to\npromote reuse of shared intermediate results. We propose two variants,\nSUSTain_M and SUSTain_T, to handle both matrix and tensor inputs, respectively.\nWe evaluate SUSTain against several state-of-the-art baselines on both\nsynthetic and real Electronic Health Record (EHR) datasets.

We\napply the strong disorder renormalization group to describe the maximally\nentangled state of the system in a strong inhomogeneity regime. Moreover, in a\nweak inhomogeneity regime, we use a continuum approximation to describe the\nstate as a thermo-field double in a conformal field theory with an effective\ntemperature which is proportional to the inhomogeneity parameter of the system.\nThe latter description also shows that the universal scaling features of this\nmodel are captured by a massless Dirac fermion in a curved space-time with\nconstant negative curvature $R=-h^2$, providing another example of the relation\nbetween quantum entanglement and space-time geometry.

This phenomenology has\nbeen called self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC).

However, the word-based CTC model suffers from\nthe out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue as it can only model limited number of words\nin the output layer and maps all the remaining words into an OOV output node.\nHence, such a word-based CTC model can only recognize the frequent words\nmodeled by the network output nodes. Our first attempt to improve the\nacoustic-to-word model is a hybrid CTC model which consults a letter-based CTC\nwhen the word-based CTC model emits OOV tokens during testing time. Then, we\npropose a much better solution by training a mixed-unit CTC model which\ndecomposes all the OOV words into sequences of frequent words and multi-letter\nunits. Evaluated on a 3400 hours Microsoft Cortana voice assistant task, the\nfinal acoustic-to-word solution improves the baseline word-based CTC by\nrelative 12.09% word error rate (WER) reduction when combined with our proposed\nattention CTC.

This parallel\nalgorithm solves the unconstrained convex minimization problem, using p\ncomputing nodes which compute updates to shared solution vectors, in an\nasynchronous fashion with no central coordination. Nodes in asynchronous\nalgorithms do not wait for updates from other nodes before starting a new\niteration, but simply compute updates using the most recent solution\ninformation available. This allows them to complete iterations much faster than\ntraditional ones, especially at scale, by eliminating the costly\nsynchronization penalty of traditional algorithms.\n  We first prove that A2BCD converges linearly to a solution with a fast\naccelerated rate that matches the recently proposed NU_ACDM, so long as the\nmaximum delay is not too large. Somewhat surprisingly, A2BCD pays no complexity\npenalty for using outdated information. We then prove lower complexity bounds\nfor randomized coordinate descent methods, which show that A2BCD (and hence\nNU_ACDM) has optimal complexity to within a constant factor. We confirm with\nnumerical experiments that A2BCD outperforms NU_ACDM, which is the current\nfastest coordinate descent algorithm, even at small scale. We also derive and\nanalyze a second-order ordinary differential equation, which is the\ncontinuous-time limit of our algorithm, and prove it converges linearly to a\nsolution with a similar accelerated rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 03:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 16:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

However, to achieve a\ncurrent-driven high-speed skyrmion motion, the required driving current density\nis usually very large, which could be energy inefficient and even destroy the\ndevice due to Joule heating. Here, we propose a voltage-driven skyrmion motion\napproach in a skyrmion shift device made of magnetic nanowires. The high-speed\nskyrmion motion is realized by utilizing the voltage shift, and the average\nskyrmion velocity reaches up to 259 m/s under 0.45 V applied voltage. In\ncomparison with the widely studied vertical current-driven model, the energy\ndissipation is three orders of magnitude lower in our voltage-driven model, for\nthe same speed motion of skyrmions. Our approach uncovers valuable\nopportunities for building skyrmion racetrack memories and logic devices with\nboth ultra-low power consumption and ultra-high processing speed, which are\nappealing features for future spintronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 07:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

An important goal is to obtain the best possible\ntradeoffs between the number of queries the algorithm makes to its oracle (the\nlocality of the task), and the amount of redundancy in the encoding (the\ninformation rate).\n  In Hamming's classical adversarial channel model, the current tradeoffs are\ndramatic, allowing either small locality, but superpolynomial blocklength, or\nsmall blocklength, but high locality. However, in the computationally bounded,\nadversarial channel model, proposed by Lipton (STACS 1994), constructions of\nlocally decodable codes suddenly exhibit small locality and small blocklength,\nbut these constructions require strong trusted setup assumptions e.g.,\nOstrovsky, Pandey and Sahai (ICALP 2007) construct private locally decodable\ncodes in the setting where the sender and receiver already share a symmetric\nkey.\n  We study variants of locally decodable and locally correctable codes in\ncomputationally bounded, adversarial channels, in a setting with no public-key\nor private-key cryptographic setup. The only setup assumption we require is the\nselection of the public parameters (seed) for a collision-resistant hash\nfunction.

Spectral clustering, as one of the main\napproaches to subspace clustering, often takes on a sparse representation or a\nlow-rank representation to learn a block diagonal self-representation matrix\nfor subspace generation. However, existing methods require solving a large\nscale convex optimization problem with a large set of data, with computational\ncomplexity reaches O(N^3) for N data points. Therefore, the efficiency and\nscalability of traditional spectral clustering methods can not be guaranteed\nfor large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a subspace clustering model\nbased on the Kronecker product. Due to the property that the Kronecker product\nof a block diagonal matrix with any other matrix is still a block diagonal\nmatrix, we can efficiently learn the representation matrix which is formed by\nthe Kronecker product of k smaller matrices. By doing so, our model\nsignificantly reduces the computational complexity to O(kN^{3/k}). Furthermore,\nour model is general in nature, and can be adapted to different regularization\nbased subspace clustering methods. Experimental results on two public datasets\nshow that our model significantly improves the efficiency compared with several\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we have conducted experiments on synthetic\ndata to verify the scalability of our model for large scale datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 09:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}

In 1962, EU policy-makers\ndeveloped the so-called Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to ensure\ncompetitiveness and a common market organisation for agricultural products,\nwhile 2003 reform decouple the CAP from the production to focus only on income\nstabilization and the sustainability of agricultural sector. Notwithstanding\nfarmers are highly dependent to public support, literature on the role played\nby the CAP in fostering agricultural performances is still scarce and\nfragmented. Actual CAP policies increases performance differentials between\nNorthern Central EU countries and peripheral regions. This paper aims to\nevaluate the effectiveness of CAP in stimulate performances by focusing on\nItalian lagged Regions. Moreover, agricultural sector is deeply rooted in\nplace-based production processes. In this sense, economic analysis which omit\nthe presence of spatial dependence produce biased estimates of the\nperformances. Therefore, this paper, using data on subsidies and economic\nresults of farms from the RICA dataset which is part of the Farm Accountancy\nData Network (FADN), proposes a spatial Augmented Cobb-Douglas Production\nFunction to evaluate the effects of subsidies on farm's performances. The major\ninnovation in this paper is the implementation of a micro-founded quantile\nversion of a spatial lag model to examine how the impact of the subsidies may\nvary across the conditional distribution of agricultural performances. Results\nshow an increasing shape which switch from negative to positive at the median\nand becomes statistical significant for higher quantiles. Additionally, spatial\nautocorrelation parameter is positive and significant across all the\nconditional distribution, suggesting the presence of significant spatial\nspillovers in agricultural performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 09:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}

The latter is because the link quality achievable at a\nWhite-Fi receiver is determined by not only its link gain to its transmitter\nbut also by its link gains to TV transmitters and its transmitter's link gains\nto TV receivers.\n  In this work, we model the medium access control (MAC) throughput of a\nWhite-Fi network. We propose heuristic algorithms to optimize the throughput,\ngiven the described heterogeneity. The algorithms assign power, access\nprobability, and channels to nodes in the network, under the constraint that\nreception at TV receivers is not compromised. We evaluate the efficacy of our\napproach over example city-wide White-Fi networks deployed over Denver and\nColumbus (respectively, low and high channel availability) in the USA, and\ncompare with assignments cognizant of heterogeneity to a lesser degree, for\nexample, akin to FCC regulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 10:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 20:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

For sufficiently lean and rich mixtures, the flame behaves as dictated\nby the Lewis number of the deficient reactant, i.e., the flame destabilizes\ntoward non-symmetric solutions for large mass flow rates when the mentioned\nLewis number is less than one. In near-stoichiometric mixtures the stability of\nthe symmetric flame depends on a weighted average value of LeF and LeO. In\nparticular, the symmetric solution is stable for large mass flow rates because\nof the difficulties found by the less diffusive reactant to reach the reactive\nzone of the flame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 10:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}

Code review is commonly used for identifying\nprogramming defects. However, manual code review has some shortcomings: a) it\nis time consuming, b) outcomes are subjective and depend on the skills of\nreviewers. An automated approach for assisting in code reviews is thus highly\ndesirable. We present a tool for assisting in code review and results from our\nexperiments evaluating the tool in different scenarios. The tool leveraged\ncontent available from professional programmer support forums (e.g.\nStackOverflow.com) to determine potential defectiveness of a given piece of\nsource code. The defectiveness is expressed on the scale of {Likely defective,\nNeutral, Unlikely to be defective}. Basic idea employed in the tool is to: a)\nIdentify a set P of discussion posts on StackOverflow such that each p in P\ncontains source code fragment(s) which sufficiently resemble the input code C\nbeing reviewed. b) Determine the likelihood of C being defective by considering\nall p in P . A novel aspect of our approach is to use document fingerprinting\nfor comparing two pieces of source code. Our choice of document fingerprinting\ntechnique is inspired by source code plagiarism detection tools where it has\nproven to be very successful. In the experiments that we performed to verify\neffectiveness of our approach source code samples from more than 300 GitHub\nopen source repositories were taken as input. A precision of more than 90% in\nidentifying correct/relevant results has been achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 10:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

In order to apply this paradigm\nto a wireless network, it is important to make sure that the common multicast\nrate does not vanish as the number of users increases. This paper focuses on a\nvariant of coded caching successively proposed for the so-called combination\nnetwork, where the multicast message is further encoded by a Maximum Distance\nSeparable (MDS) code and the MDS-coded blocks are simultaneously transmitted\nfrom different Edge Nodes (ENs) (e.g., base stations or access points). Each\nuser is equipped with multiple antennas and can select to decode a desired\nnumber of EN transmissions, while either nulling of treating as noise the\nothers, depending on their strength. The system is reminiscent of the so-called\nevolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS), in the sense that the\nfundamental underlying transmission mechanism is multipoint multicasting, where\neach user can independently and individually (in a user-centric manner) decide\nwhich EN to decode, without any explicit association of users to ENs.

Crossing minimization in\ncircular layouts is \\NP-hard. One way to allow for fewer crossings in practice\nare two-sided layouts that draw some edges as curves in the exterior of the\ncircle. In fact, one- and two-sided circular layouts are equivalent to one-page\nand two-page book drawings, i.e., graph layouts with all vertices placed on a\nline (the spine) and edges drawn in one or two distinct half-planes (the pages)\nbounded by the spine. In this paper we study the problem of minimizing the\ncrossings for a fixed cyclic vertex order by computing an optimal $k$-plane set\nof exteriorly drawn edges for $k \\ge 1$, extending the previously studied case\n$k=0$. We show that this relates to finding bounded-degree maximum-weight\ninduced subgraphs of circle graphs, which is a graph-theoretic problem of\nindependent interest.

Although magnetars represent\nonly a small percentage of the known isolated neutron stars, there are almost\ncertainly many more of them, since most magnetars were discovered in transitory\nphases called outbursts, during which they are particularly noticeable. In\noutburst, in fact, a magnetar can be brighter in X-rays by orders of magnitude\nand usually emit powerful bursts of hard-X/soft-gamma-ray photons that can be\ndetected almost everywhere in the Galaxy with all-sky monitors such as those on\nboard the Fermi satellite or the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Magnetars\ncommand great attention because the large progress that has been made in their\nunderstanding is proving fundamental to fathom the whole population of isolated\nneutron stars, and because, due to their extreme properties, they are relevant\nfor a vast range of different astrophysical topics, from the study of gamma-ray\nbursts and superluminous supernovae, to ultraluminous X-ray sources, fast radio\nbursts, and even to sources of gravitational waves.

Due to the large frequency\nseparation between Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL), in FDD systems channel\nreciprocity does not hold. Hence, in order to provide DL channel state\ninformation to the Base Station (BS), closed-loop DL channel probing and\nChannel State Information (CSI) feedback is needed. In massive MIMO this incurs\ntypically a large training overhead. For example, in a typical configuration\nwith M = 200 BS antennas and fading coherence block of T = 200 symbols, the\nresulting rate penalty factor due to the DL training overhead, given by max{0,\n1 - M/T}, is close to 0. To reduce this overhead, we build upon the well-known\nfact that the Angular Scattering Function (ASF) of the user channels is\ninvariant over frequency intervals whose size is small with respect to the\ncarrier frequency (as in current FDD cellular standards). This allows to\nestimate the users' DL channel covariance matrix from UL pilots without\nadditional overhead. Based on this covariance information, we propose a novel\nsparsifying precoder in order to maximize the rank of the effective sparsified\nchannel matrix subject to the condition that each effective user channel has\nsparsity not larger than some desired DL pilot dimension T_{dl}, resulting in\nthe DL training overhead factor max{0, 1 - T_{dl} / T} and CSI feedback cost of\nT_{dl} pilot measurements. The optimization of the sparsifying precoder is\nformulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program, that can be efficiently solved.\nExtensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\napproach with respect to concurrent state-of-the-art schemes based on\ncompressed sensing or UL/DL dictionary learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:08:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 21:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

Following this classification, we confirm 53 clusters, which means\nthat 46% of this PSZ1 subsample has been validated and characterized with this\ntechnique. Sixty-two SZ sources (54% of this PSZ1 subset) remain unconfirmed.\nIn addition, we find that the fraction of unconfirmed clusters close to the\ngalactic plane (at |b|<25deg) is greater than that at higher galactic latitudes\n(|b|>25deg), which indicates contamination produced by radio emission of\ngalactic dust and gas clouds on these SZ detections. In fact, in the majority\nof the cases, we detect important galactic cirrus in the optical images, mainly\nin the SZ target located at low galactic latitudes, which supports this\nhypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

We argue\nthat hyperbolic geometry constitutes a natural framework to address the study\nof positive geometries in moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and thus to try to\nextend this achievement beyond tree level. In this paper we begin an\nexploration of these ideas starting from the simplest example of hyperbolic\ngeometry, the hyperbolic plane. The hyperboloid model naturally guides us to\nre-discover the moduli space Associahedron, and a new version of its\nkinematical avatar. As a by-product we obtain a solution to the scattering\nequations which can be interpreted as a special case of the two well known\nsolutions in terms of spinor-helicity formalism. The construction is done in\n$1+2$ dimensions and this makes harder to understand how to extract the\namplitude from the dlog of the space time Associahedron. Nevertheless, we\ncontinue the investigation accommodating a loop momentum in the picture. By\ndoing this we are led to another polytope called Halohedron, which was already\nknown to mathematicians. We argue that the Halohedron fulfils many criteria\nthat make it plausible to be understood as a 1-loop Amplituhedron for the cubic\ntheory. Furthermore, the hyperboloid model again allows to understand that a\nkinematical version of the Halohedron exists and is related to the one living\nin moduli space by a simple generalisation of the tree level map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

It is\ndemonstrated that chaos synchronization quality is robust to 10-15 % parameter\nmismatches. It is also elucidated that for the intermediary noise intensity\ncorrelation between the synchronized junctions can be even enhanced; however\nfor larger intensities of noise synchronization quality deteriorates. It is\nalso established that synchronization quality between some junctions remains\nunchanged, despite the fact that all the driven junctions and the driver\njunction were subject to the same amount of noise. These results are of certain\nimportance for obtaining the high power system of Josephson junctions in\nreal-life situations and are promising for practical applications in the\nTerahertz region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 11:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}

The algorithm may be used to predict any clusters previously\nobserved in a driver's trip history. It assumes that the driver's historical\ntrips are grouped into clusters sharing similar patterns. Given a new trip, the\nalgorithm attempts to predict the cluster in which the trip belongs. The\nproposed algorithm has low temporal complexity. In addition, it does not\nrequire the transition and emission matrices of the Markov chain to be\ncomputed. Rather it relies on the frequencies of co-occurrences of road links\nand trip clusters. We validate the proposed algorithm against an experimental\ndataset. We discuss the success and convergence of the algorithm and show that\nour algorithm has a high prediction success rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 08:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}
