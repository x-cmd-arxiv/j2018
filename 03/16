In this\nmethod interaction between nuclei and electrons is considered explicitly up to\nthe second order in atomic displacements defined with respect to the mean\natomic trajectory. This method enables one to consider movement of atoms beyond\ntheir simple vibrations. Both electrons and nuclei are treated fully\nquantum-mechanically using a combination of path integrals applied to nuclei\nand non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) to elections. Our method is\npartition-less: initially, the entire system is coupled and assumed to be at\nthermal equilibrium. Then, the exact application of the Hubbard-Stratanovich\ntransformation in mixed real and imaginary times enables us to obtain, without\ndoing any additional approximations, an exact expression for the reduced\ndensity matrix for nuclei and hence an effective quantum Liouville equation for\nthem, both containing Gaussian noises. It is shown that the time evolution of\nthe expectation values for atomic positions is described by an infinite\nhierarchy of stochastic differential equations for atomic positions and momenta\nand their various fluctuations. The actual dynamics is obtained by sampling all\nstochastic trajectories. It is expected that applications of the method may\ninclude photo-induced chemical reactions (e.g. dissociation), electromigration,\natomic manipulation in scanning tunneling microscopy, to name just a few.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:05:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

CALET directly\nmeasures the cosmic-ray electron spectrum in the energy range of 1 GeV to 20\nTeV with a 2% energy resolution above 30 GeV.

Calibration data\nacquisition by, for example, recording pedestal and penetrating particle\nevents, a low-energy electron trigger mode operating at high geomagnetic\nlatitude, a low-energy gamma-ray trigger mode operating at low geomagnetic\nlatitude, and an ultra heavy trigger mode, are scheduled around the ISS orbit\nwhile maintaining maximum exposure to high-energy electrons and other\nhigh-energy shower events by always having the high-energy trigger mode active.\nThe WCOC also prepares and distributes CALET flight data to collaborators in\nItaly and the United States.\n  As of August 31, 2017, the total observation time is 689 days with a live\ntime fraction of the total time of approximately 84%. Nearly 450 million events\nare collected with a high-energy (E>10 GeV) trigger.

Since it is more difficult to generate the critical stress in small\nnanomagnets than in large nanomagnets (having the same energy barrier for\nthermal stability), it would be a challenge to downscale magneto-elastically\nswitched nanomagnets in memory and other applications where reliable switching\nis required. This is likely to be further exacerbated by the presence of\ndefects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 03:19:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 03:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

If one focuses on the onset of the collective oscillations,\non the other hand, the equations can be linearized and the technique of linear\nanalysis can be employed.

This\nsuggests that either the inflow variations and jet IR emission are coupled by a\nnon-linear or time-variable transform, or that the IR rms-flux relation is not\ntransferred from the inflow to the jet, but is an intrinsic property of\nemission processes in the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

We re-investigate here one of\nthese scaling relations in active galactic nuclei (AGN); the so-called X-ray\nvariability plane (or mass-luminosity-timescale relation, McHardy et al. 2006).\nThis relation links the power-spectral density (PSD) break frequency with the\nsuper-massive black hole (SMBH) mass and the bolometric luminosity. We used\navailable XMM -Newton observations of a sample of 22 AGN to study the PSD and\nspectra in short segments within each observation. This allows us to report for\nthe first time that the PSD break frequency varies for each object, showing\nvariations in 19 out of the 22 AGN analyzed. Our analysis of the variability\nplane confirms the relation between the break frequency and the SMBH mass and\nfinds that the obscuration along the line of sight NH (or the variations on the\nobscuration using its standard deviation, $\\rm{\\Delta}$(NH)) is also a required\nparameter, at least for the range of frequencies analyzed here\n(3x10E-5-5x10E-2Hz).

This is because not only does it\ncontribute towards an additional force, but it also accounts for the deviation\nof local surface tension from its static equilibrium value. It is shown that\nthis gradient in surface tension can be attributed to the convective\nacceleration in the vicinity of the contact line, which in turn is a direct\nresult of varying degree of slip in that region.

A natural question in this\ncontext is to understand if other natural classes of multivariate polynomials,\nfor instance, arithmetic formulas, algebraic branching programs, bounded depth\narithmetic circuits or the class VNP, are closed under taking factors.\n  In this paper, we show that all factors of degree at most $\\log^a n$ of\npolynomials with poly(n) size depth $k$ circuits have poly(n) size circuits of\ndepth at most $O(k + a)$. This partially answers a question of\nShpilka-Yehudayoff and has applications to hardness-randomness tradeoffs for\nbounded depth arithmetic circuits. More precisely, this shows that a\nsuperpolynomial lower bound for bounded depth arithmetic circuits, for a family\nof explicit polynomials of degree poly$(\\log n)$ implies deterministic\nsub-exponential time algorithms for polynomial identity testing (PIT) for\nbounded depth arithmetic circuits. This is incomparable to a beautiful result\nof Dvir et al., where they showed that super-polynomial lower bounds for\nconstant depth arithmetic circuits for any explicit family of polynomials (of\npotentially high degree) implies sub-exponential time deterministic PIT for\nbounded depth circuits of bounded individual degree. Thus, we remove the\n\"bounded individual degree\" condition in [DSY09] at the cost of strengthening\nthe hardness assumption to hold for polynomials of low degree.\n  As direct applications of our techniques, we also show that the complexity\nclass VNP is closed under taking factors, thereby confirming a conjecture of\nB\\\"urgisser and get an alternate proof of the fact (first shown by Dutta et\nal.) that if a polynomial $Q$ of degree at most $d$ divides a polynomial $P$\ncomputable by a formula of size $s$, then $Q$ has a formula of size at most\npoly$(s, d^{\\log d}, deg(P))$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 18:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

A beacon is a fixed point with\nan attraction pull that can move points within a given polygon. Points move\ngreedily towards a beacon: if unobstructed, they move along a straight line to\nthe beacon, and otherwise they slide on the edges of the polygon. The Euclidean\ndistance from a moving point to a beacon is monotonically decreasing. A given\nbeacon attracts a point if the point eventually reaches the beacon.\n  The problem of attracting all points within a polygon with a set of beacons\ncan be viewed as a variation of the art gallery problem. Unlike most\nvariations, the beacon attraction has the intriguing property of being\nasymmetric, leading to separate definitions of attraction region and inverse\nattraction region. The attraction region of a beacon is the set of points that\nit attracts. It is connected and can be computed in linear time for simple\npolygons. By contrast, it is known that the inverse attraction region of a\npoint---the set of beacon positions that attract it---could have $\\Omega(n)$\ndisjoint connected components.\n  In this paper, we prove that, in spite of this, the total complexity of the\ninverse attraction region of a point in a simple polygon is linear, and present\na $O(n \\log n)$ time algorithm to construct it.

For example, molecular oxygen is\nabundant in the atmosphere today but was absent on the early Earth. Meanwhile,\nthe physical and chemical evolution of Earth's atmosphere has also resulted in\nmajor swings in surface temperature, at times resulting in extreme glaciation\nor warm greenhouse climates. Despite this dynamic and occasionally dramatic\nhistory, the Earth has been persistently habitable--and, in fact,\ninhabited--for roughly 4 billion years. Understanding Earth's momentous changes\nand its enduring habitability is essential as a guide to the diversity of\nhabitable planetary environments that may exist beyond our solar system and for\nultimately recognizing spectroscopic fingerprints of life elsewhere in the\nUniverse. Here, we review long-term trends in the composition of Earth's\natmosphere as it relates to both planetary habitability and inhabitation.

Some common applications are not only filtering and sorting\nalternatives, but also changing certain attributes in real-time (e.g., changing\nthe price). In this paper, we concentrate with the problem of modeling air\npassenger choices of flight itineraries. This problem has historically been\ntackled using classical Discrete Choice Modelling techniques. Traditional\nstatistical approaches, in particular the Multinomial Logit model (MNL), is\nwidely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity and general good\nperformance. However, MNL models present several shortcomings and assumptions\nthat might not hold in real applications. To overcome these difficulties, we\npresent a new choice model based on Pointer Networks. Given an input sequence,\nthis type of deep neural architecture combines Recurrent Neural Networks with\nthe Attention Mechanism to learn the conditional probability of an output whose\nvalues correspond to positions in an input sequence. Therefore, given a\nsequence of different alternatives presented to a customer, the model can learn\nto point to the one most likely to be chosen by the customer. The proposed\nmethod was evaluated on a real dataset that combines on-line user search logs\nand airline flight bookings. Experimental results show that the proposed model\noutperforms the traditional MNL model on several metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 19:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

Using a\nrecently introduced manybody perturbation formalism for fermions, we propose a\nmechanism for the emergence of collective behavior, specifically superfluidity,\ndriven by quantum statistics and the enforcement of the Pauli principle through\nthe selection of normal modes. The method, which is called symmetry invariant\nperturbation theory (SPT), uses group theory and graphical techniques to solve\nthe manybody Schrodinger equation through first order exactly. The solution at\nfirst order defines collective coordinates in terms of five N-body normal\nmodes, identified as breathing, center of mass, single particle angular\nexcitation, single particle radial excitation and phonon. A correspondence is\nestablished \"on paper\" that enforces the Pauli principle through the assignment\nof specific normal mode quantum numbers. Applied in the unitary regime, this\nnormal mode assignment yields occupation only in an extremely low frequency\nN-body phonon mode at ultralow temperatures. A single particle radial\nexcitation mode at a much higher frequency creates a gap that stabilizes the\nsuperfluidity at low temperatures. Coupled with the corresponding values for\nthe frequencies at unitarity obtained by this manybody calculation, we obtain\ngood agreement with experimental thermodynamic results including the lambda\ntransition in the specific heat. Our results suggest that the emergence of\ncollective behavior in macroscopic systems is driven by the Pauli principle and\nits selection of the correct collective coordinates in the form of N-body\nnormal modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 19:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

The triple-energy data acquisition is\nimplemented at the scales of micro-CT and clinical CT imaging with commercial\n\"TwinBeam\" dual-source DECT configuration and a fast kV switching DECT\nconfiguration. Material decomposition and quantitative comparison with a photon\ncounting detector and with the presence of a bow-tie filter are also performed.\nThe proposed method provides quantitative material- and energy-selective images\nexamining realistic configurations for both dual- and triple-energy CT\nmeasurements. Compared to the polychromatic kV CT images, virtual monochromatic\nimages show superior image quality. For the mouse phantom, quantitative\nmeasurements show that the differences between gadodiamide and iodine\nconcentrations obtained using TECT and idealized photon counting CT (PCCT) are\nsmaller than 8 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively. TECT outperforms DECT for\nmulti-contrast CT imaging and is robust with respect to spectrum estimation.\nFor the thorax phantom, the differences between the concentrations of the\ncontrast map and the corresponding true reference values are smaller than 7\nmg/mL for all of the realistic configurations. A unified framework for both\ndual- and triple-energy CT imaging has been established for the accurate\nextraction of material compositions; considering currently available commercial\nDECT configurations.

They can\nbe used to store and share information without a trusted central party. There\nhas been much effort to develop blockchain systems for a myriad of uses,\nranging from cryptocurrencies to identity control, supply chain management,\netc. None of this work has directly studied the fundamental database issues\nthat arise when using blockchains as the underlying infrastructure to manage\ndata.\n  The key difference between using blockchains to store data and centrally\ncontrolled databases is that transactions are accepted to a blockchain via a\nconsensus mechanism. Hence, once a user has issued a transaction, she cannot be\ncertain if it will be accepted. Moreover, a yet unaccepted transaction cannot\nbe retracted by the user, and may be appended to the blockchain in the future.\nThis causes difficulties as the user may wish to reissue a transaction, if it\nwas not accepted. Yet this data may then become appended twice to the\nblockchain.\n  In this paper we present a database perspective on blockchains by introducing\nformal foundations for blockchains as a storage layer that underlies a\ndatabase. The main issue that we tackle is uncertainty in transaction appending\nthat is a result of the consensus mechanism. We study two flavors of\ntransaction appending problems: (1) the complexity of determining whether it is\npossible for a denial constraint to be contradicted, given the state of the\nblockchain, pending transactions, and integrity constraints and (2) the\ncomplexity of generating transactions that are mutually (in)consistent with\ngiven subsets of pending transactions. Solving these problems is critical to\nensure that users can issue transactions consistent with their intentions.\nFinally, we chart important directions for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 21:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

We then analyze the behavior of the\nsame quantity for the free scalar and Dirac theories on real projective spaces\nin arbitrary dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 22:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

Theoretical models have accounted for\nthis finding by hypothesizing that cold clouds start to condense out of the\nambient medium when t_cool/t_ff < 10 and fuel a strong black-hole feedback\nresponse that reheats the ambient gas, but those models have not yet been able\nto provide a simple explanation for the origin of the critical t_cool/t_ff\nratio. This paper explores a heuristic model for condensation that links the\ncritical ratio to turbulent driving of gravity-wave oscillations. In the linear\nregime, internal gravity waves are thermally unstable in a thermally balanced\nmedium. Buoyancy oscillations in a balanced medium with t_cool/t_ff therefore\ngrow until they saturate without condensing at an amplitude that depends on\nt_cool/t_ff. However, in a medium with 10 < t_cool/t_ff < 20, turbulence with a\nvelocity dispersion roughly half the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion can\ndrive those oscillations into condensation. Intriguingly, this is indeed the\ngas-phase velocity dispersion observed among galaxy-cluster cores that contain\nmultiphase gas. It is therefore possible that both the critical t_cool/t_ff\nratio for condensation of ambient gas and the level of turbulence in that gas\nare determined by coupling between condensation, feedback, and turbulence. Such\na system can converge to a well-regulated equilibrium state, as long as the\nfraction of feedback energy that goes into turbulence is significantly less\nthan the fraction that goes more directly into heat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 23:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 17:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 18:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

This lack of modeling semantic\ncorrelations also makes prior works must tune highly-specified models for each\ntask due to the label discrepancy across datasets. It severely limits the\ngeneralization capability of segmentation models for open set concept\nvocabulary and annotation utilization. In this paper, we propose a\nDynamic-Structured Semantic Propagation Network (DSSPN) that builds a semantic\nneuron graph by explicitly incorporating the semantic concept hierarchy into\nnetwork construction. Each neuron represents the instantiated module for\nrecognizing a specific type of entity such as a super-class (e.g. food) or a\nspecific concept (e.g. pizza). During training, DSSPN performs the\ndynamic-structured neuron computation graph by only activating a sub-graph of\nneurons for each image in a principled way. A dense semantic-enhanced neural\nblock is proposed to propagate the learned knowledge of all ancestor neurons\ninto each fine-grained child neuron for feature evolving. Another merit of such\nsemantic explainable structure is the ability of learning a unified model\nconcurrently on diverse datasets by selectively activating different neuron\nsub-graphs for each annotation at each step. Extensive experiments on four\npublic semantic segmentation datasets (i.e. ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, Cityscape and\nMapillary) demonstrate the superiority of our DSSPN over state-of-the-art\nsegmentation models.

These trends have introduced the\nconcept of scalability as reaching a desirable performance per unit cost by\nusing as few number of units as possible. Many proposals have moved compute\ncloser to the memory. However, these efforts ignored maintaining a balance\nbetween bandwidth and compute rate of an architecture, with those of\napplications, which is a key principle in designing scalable large systems.\nThis paper proposes the use of memory slices, a modular building block for\nscalable memory systems integrated with compute, in which performance scales\nwith memory size (and volume of data). The slice architecture utilizes a\nprogrammable memory interface feeding a systolic compute engine with high reuse\nrate. The modularity feature of slice-based systems is exploited with a\npartitioning and data mapping strategy across allocated memory slices where\ntraining performance scales with the data size. These features enable shifting\nthe most pressure to cheap compute units rather than expensive memory accesses\nor transfers via interconnection network. An application of the memory slices\nto a scale-out memory system is accelerating the training of recurrent,\nconvolutional, and hybrid neural networks (RNNs and RNNs+CNN) that are forming\ncloud workloads. The results of our cycle-level simulations show that memory\nslices exhibits a superlinear speedup when the number of slices increases.\nFurthermore, memory slices improve power efficiency to 747 GFLOPs/J for\ntraining LSTMs. While our current evaluation uses memory slices with 3D\npackaging, a major value is that slices can also be constructed with a variety\nof packaging options, for example with DDR-based memory units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 03:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

The models consist of multiple flux ropes with mixed signs of helicity,\ni.e., positive (negative) in the northern (southern) region, which is\nconsistent with the GST observations of multiple filament bundles. The\nfootprints of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) derived from the extrapolated\nNLFFF compare favorably with the observed flare ribbons.

Approximately after half of the\nlight curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nlag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior is\naccompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to\nunderstand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby\nincreasing the covering fraction of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations. The ultraviolet\ncontinua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet\nvariations. Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling\ncorona would dilute the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional observational\nfacts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and\nionization energy. We also show that the time lag and correlation between the\nX-ray and the ultraviolet variations change as NGC 5548 displays the anomalous\nbehavior. The time lag is dramatically longer than the expectation from disk\nreprocessing if the anomalous behavior is properly excluded. During the\nanomalous state, the time lag approaches the light-travel timescale of disk\nreprocessing albeit with a much weaker correlation. We speculate that the time\nlag in the normal state is caused by reprocessing of the broad line region gas.\nAs NGC 5548 enters the abnormal state, the contribution of the broad line\nregion gas is smaller; the time lag reflects disk reprocessing.

The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the\noverwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady\naccreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The\nthird is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading\ndirectly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that\nis simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect.\nFor concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in\naccretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical\nwork directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic\n(\"viscous\") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective\nradiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission\nproblem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar\nto breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar,\npermitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow\nthan otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent,\ntangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an\nangular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve.\nMoreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate\nbut to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then\nvertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then\nthat jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar\njets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

These\nmotions may play a key role in the transport of energy and momentum from the\nlower atmosphere into the upper solar atmosphere, contributing to coronal\nheating. The lower solar atmosphere also consists of complex networks of flux\ntubes that expand and merge throughout the chromosphere and upper atmosphere.\nWe perform numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of vortex driven\nwaves propagating in a pair of such flux tubes in a non-force-free equilibrium\nwith a realistically modelled solar atmosphere. The two flux tubes are\nindependently perturbed at their footpoints by counter-rotating vortex motions.\nWhen the flux tubes merge, the vortex motions interact both linearly and\nnonlinearly. The linear interactions generate many small-scale transient\nmagnetic substructures due to the magnetic stress imposed by the vortex\nmotions. Thus, an initially monolithic tube is separated into a complex\nmulti-threaded tube due to the photospheric vortex motions. The wave\ninteractions also drive a superposition that increases in amplitude until it\nexceeds the local Mach number and produces shocks that propagate upwards with\nspeeds of approximately $ 50$ km s$^{-1}$. The shocks act as conduits\ntransporting momentum and energy upwards, and heating the local plasma by more\nthan an order of magnitude, with peak temperature approximately $60,000$ K.\nTherefore, we present a new mechanism for the generation of magnetic waveguides\nfrom the lower solar atmosphere to the solar corona. This wave guide appears as\nthe result of interacting perturbations in neighbouring flux tubes. Thus, the\ninteractions of photospheric vortex motions is a potentially significant\nmechanism for energy transfer from the lower to upper solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 08:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

This observation leads this chapter to argue that the field of\ne-democracy has generally failed to live up to its own reformist rhetoric. It\nargues that instead of reforming government processes through technology,\ne-democracy projects have tended to focus either on lowering the costs and\nincreasing the efficiency of existing political processes or on analysing the\ncivic participation that occurs outside of purpose-built e-democracy platforms.\nThe chapter suggests that this lack of attention to the Internet's potential\nfor systemic change in formal political institutions has little normative\nimpact on the democratization of society and may even re-enforce, rather than\nchallenge, the sociopolitical status quo. Further, it suggests that the current\napproach of e-democracy risks normalizing the Internet to the norms and\nexpectations of the offline world. To elucidate this argument, this chapter\noverviews both the general trend of e-democracy projects and criticisms of\nthose projects. Finally, the chapter proposes a more radical vision of\ne-democracy that, it suggests, would usher a larger potential for\ndemocratization. This more radical vision of e-democracy consists of\nrecognizing the attributes of the Internet that transcend the limits of the\nanalogue world and applying these to democracy. Such an approach would open the\npath for envisaging new political processes and systems, allowing the field of\ne-democracy to live up to its own rhetoric, and affording society the means to\naddress multiple of the centuries-old problems faced by democracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 09:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

It\nwas originally proposed by Google for ranking pages in the World-Wide Web. One\nof the intriguing empirical properties of PageRank is the so-called `power-law\nhypothesis': in a scale-free network the PageRank scores follow a power law\nwith the same exponent as the (in-)degrees. Up to date, this hypothesis has\nbeen confirmed empirically and in several specific random graphs models. In\ncontrast, this paper does not focus on one random graph model but investigates\nthe existence of an asymptotic PageRank distribution, when the graph size goes\nto infinity, using local weak convergence. This may help to identify general\nnetwork structures in which the power-law hypothesis holds. We start from the\ndefinition of local weak convergence for sequences of (random) undirected\ngraphs, and extend this notion to directed graphs. To this end, we define an\nexploration process in the directed setting that keeps track of in- and\nout-degrees of vertices. Then we use this to prove the existence of an\nasymptotic PageRank distribution. As a result, the limiting distribution of\nPageRank can be computed directly as a function of the limiting object. We\napply our results to the directed configuration model and continuous-time\nbranching processes trees, as well as preferential attachment models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 10:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

In the present paper we analyze oscillations and waves in seven\nexamples of drifting pulsation structures, observed by the 800-2000 MHz\nOndrejov radiospectrograph. For their analysis we use a new type of oscillation\nmaps which give us a much more information about processes in DPSs than that in\nprevious analyzes. Based on these oscillation maps, made from radio spectra by\nthe wavelet technique, we recognized quasi-periodic oscillations with periods\nranging from about 1 to 108 s in all studied DPSs. This strongly supports the\nidea that DPSs are generated during a fragmented magnetic reconnection. Phases\nof most the oscillations in DPSs, especially for the period around 1 s, are\nsynchronized (\"infinite\" frequency drift) in the whole frequency range of DPSs.\nFor longer periods in some DPSs we found that the phases of the oscillations\ndrift with the frequency drift in the interval from -17 to +287 MHz\\s.

When they\ncross the orbit of a planet, a fraction of these drifting pebbles will be\naccreted. In the pebble accretion mechanism, the combined effects of the\nplanet's gravitational attraction and gas drag greatly increase the accretion\nrate. We calculate the pebble accretion efficiency $\\varepsilon_{2D}$ -- the\nprobability a pebble is accreted by the planet -- in the 2D limit (pebbles\nreside in the midplane). In particular, we investigate the dependence of\n$\\varepsilon_{2D}$ on the planet eccentricity and its implications for planet\nformation models. We conduct N-body simulations to calculate the pebble\naccretion efficiency in both the local frame and the global frame. With the\nglobal method we investigate the pebble accretion efficiency when the planet is\non an eccentric orbit. We find that the local and the global methods generally\ngive consistent results. The efficiency increases with the planet's\neccentricity once the relative velocity between the pebble and the planet is\ndetermined by the planet's eccentric velocity. At large eccentricities,\nhowever, the relative velocity becomes too large for pebble accretion. The\nefficiency then drops significantly and the accretion enters the ballistic\nregime. We present general expressions for $\\varepsilon_{2D}$. Applying the\nobtained formula to the formation of a secondary planet, in resonance with an\nalready-formed giant planet, we find that the embryo grows quickly due to its\nlarger eccentricity. The maximum $\\varepsilon_{2D}$ for a planet on an\neccentric orbit is several times higher than for a planet on a circular orbit,\nbut this increase gives the planet an important headstart and boosts its\nfollowing mass growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 10:31:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 11:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The polarization characteristics of the\ninner disk suggest that dust settling has not occurred yet with a maximum dust\ngrain size between 50 and 500 mum. The outer part of the disk has a clear\nazimuthal pattern but with a significantly higher polarization fraction\ncompared to the inner disk.

Forbush decreases are sudden suppressions of the GCR intensities\nwhich are associated with the passage of interplanetary transients such as\nshocks and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Most of the past\nmeasurements of this phenomenon were carried out with ground-based detectors\nsuch as neutron monitors or muon telescopes. These techniques allow only the\nindirect detection of the overall GCR intensity over an integrated energy\nrange. For the first time, thanks to the unique features of the PAMELA magnetic\nspectrometer, the Forbush decrease commencing on 2006 December 14, following a\nCME at the Sun on 2006 December 13 was studied in a wide rigidity range (0.4 -\n20 GV) and for different species of GCRs detected directly in space. The daily\naveraged GCR proton intensity was used to investigate the rigidity dependence\nof the amplitude and the recovery time of the Forbush decrease. Additionally,\nfor the first time, the temporal variations in the helium and electron\nintensities during a Forbush decrease were studied. Interestingly, the temporal\nevolutions of the helium and proton intensities during the Forbush decrease\nwere found in good agreement, while the low rigidity electrons (< 2 GV)\ndisplayed a faster recovery. This difference in the electron recovery is\ninterpreted as a charge-sign dependence introduced by drift motions experienced\nby the GCRs during their propagation through the heliosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 11:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

To explain these findings, we developed a model scenario for the inner\n~30 pc of an AGN. We assume a rotating thick gas disk between about one and ten\nparsec. External gas accretion adds mass and injects energy via gas compression\ninto this gas disk and drives turbulence. Our disks are assumed to be strongly\nmagnetized via equipartition between the turbulent gas pressure and the energy\ndensity of the magnetic field. In a second step, we built three dimensional\ndensity cubes based on the analytical model, illuminated them with a central\nsource, and made radiative transfer calculations. In a third step, we\ncalculated MIR visibility amplitudes and compared them to available\ninterferometric observations. We show that magnetocentrifugal winds starting\nfrom a thin and thick gas disk are viable in active galaxy centers. Once the\nwind is launched, it is responsible for the transport of angular momentum and\nthe gas disk can become thin. The outflow scenario can account for the\nelongated dust structures, outer edges of the thin maser disks, and molecular\noutflows observed in local AGN. The models reproduce the observed terminal wind\nvelocities, the scatter of the MIR/intrinsic X-ray correlation, and point\nsource fractions. An application of the model to the Circinus Galaxy and NGC\n1068 shows that the IR SED, available MIR interferometric observations, and\noptical polarization can be reproduced in a satisfactory way, provided that (i)\na puff-up at the inner edge of the thin disk is present and (ii) a local screen\nwith an optical depth of tau_V 20 in form of a local gas filament and/or a warp\nof the thick disk hide a significant fraction of both nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 12:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Yet, common analysis practices in such\nfields that might be transposed from other statistical techniques such as model\nacceptance or rejection based on p-value screening might be poorly fitted for\nSEMs especially when these models are used to confirm or reject hypotheses.\n  In this simulation study, SEMs were fitted via two commonly used R packages:\nlavaan and piecewiseSEM. Five different data-generation scenarios were\nexplored: (i) random, (ii) exact, (iii) shuffled, (iv) underspecified and (v)\noverspecified. In addition, sample size and model complexity were also varied\nto explore their impact on various global and local model fitness indices.\n  The results showed that not one single model index should be used to decide\non model fitness but rather a combination of different model fitness indices is\nneeded. The global chi-square test for lavaan or the Fisher's C statistic for\npiecewiseSEM were, in isolation, poor indicators of model fitness. In addition,\nthe simulations showed that to achieve sufficient power to detect individual\neffects, adequate sample sizes are required. Finally, BIC showed good capacity\nto select models closer to the truth especially for more complex models.\n  I provide, based on these results, a flowchart indicating how information\nfrom different metrics may be combined to reveal model strength and weaknesses.\nResearchers in scientific fields with little experience in SEMs, such as in\necology, should consider and accept these limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 12:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 09:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 13:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

In this paper we relax the standard assumption that SNIa intrinsic\nluminosity is independent of the redshift, and we examine whether it may have\nan impact on the accelerated nature of the expansion of the Universe. In order\nto be as general as possible, we reconstruct the expansion rate of the Universe\nthrough a cubic spline interpolation fitting observations of different probes:\nSNIa, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the high-redshift information\nfrom the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We show that when SNIa intrinsic\nluminosity is not allowed to vary as a function of the redshift, cosmic\nacceleration is definitely proven in a model-independent approach. However,\nallowing for a redshift dependence, a non-accelerated reconstruction of the\nexpansion rate is able to fit, as well as $\\Lambda$CDM, the combination of SNIa\nand BAO data, both treating the BAO standard ruler $r_d$ as a free parameter,\nor adding the recently published prior from CMB observations. We further extend\nthe analysis by including the CMB data, and we show that a non-accelerated\nreconstruction is able to nicely fit this combination of low and high-redshift\ndata. In this work we present a model-independent reconstruction of a\nnon-accelerated expansion rate of the Universe that is able to nicely fit all\nthe main background cosmological probes. However, the predicted value of $H_0$\nis in tension with recent direct measurements. Our analysis points out that a\nfinal, reliable, and consensual value for $H_0$ would be critical to\ndefinitively prove the cosmic acceleration in a model-independent way.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 12:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Correspondingly, the local event\nrate of FRBs is constrained to $(3-6)\\times10^4f_{\\rm b}^{-1}(\\mathcal T/270\\rm\ns)^{-1}(\\mathcal A/2\\pi)^{-1}\\rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for an adopted minimum FRB\nenergy of $E_{\\min}=3\\times10^{39}$ erg, where $f_{\\rm b}$ is the beaming\nfactor of the radiation, $\\mathcal T$ is the duration of each pointing\nobservation, and $\\mathcal A $ is the sky area of the survey. This event rate,\nabout an order of magnitude higher than the rates of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers,\nindicates that the most promising origin of FRBs in the CBM scenario could be\nmergers of WD-WD binaries. Here a massive WD could be produced since no FRB was\nfound to be associated with a type Ia supernova. Alternatively, if actually all\nFRBs can repeat on a timescale much longer than the period of current\nobservations, then they could also originate from a young active NS that forms\nfrom relatively rare NS-NS mergers and accretion-induced collapses of WD-WD\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

In this work,\nsuitable data acquisition schemes, subspace sizes, and efficiencies for banding\nremoval are investigated.\n  Theory and Methods: By combining a fmSSFP MRI sequence with a 3D\nstack-of-stars trajectory, scan efficiency is maximized as spectral information\nis obtained without intermediate preparation phases. A memory-efficient\nreconstruction routine is implemented by introducing the low-frequency Fourier\ntransform as a subspace which allows for the formulation of a convex\nreconstruction problem. The removal of banding artifacts is investigated by\ncomparing the proposed acquisition and reconstruction technique to phase-cycled\nbSSFP MRI. Aliasing properties of different undersampling schemes are analyzed\nand water/fat separation is demonstrated by reweighting the reconstructed\nsubspace coefficients to generate virtual spectral responses in a\npost-processing step.\n  Results: A simple root-of-sum-of-squares combination of the reconstructed\nsubspace coefficients yields high-SNR images with the characteristic bSSFP\ncontrast but without banding artifacts.

The\npremise of VQA's significance as a benchmark in AI, is that both the image and\ntextual question need to be well understood and mutually grounded in order to\ninfer the correct answer. However, current VQA models perhaps `understand' less\nthan initially hoped, and instead master the easier task of exploiting cues\ngiven away in the question and biases in the answer distribution. In this paper\nwe propose the inverse problem of VQA (iVQA). The iVQA task is to generate a\nquestion that corresponds to a given image and answer pair. We propose a\nvariational iVQA model that can generate diverse, grammatically correct and\ncontent correlated questions that match the given answer. Based on this model,\nwe show that iVQA is an interesting benchmark for visuo-linguistic\nunderstanding, and a more challenging alternative to VQA because an iVQA model\nneeds to understand the image better to be successful. As a second\ncontribution, we show how to use iVQA in a novel reinforcement learning\nframework to diagnose any existing VQA model by way of exposing its belief set:\nthe set of question-answer pairs that the VQA model would predict true for a\ngiven image. This provides a completely new window into what VQA models\n`believe' about images. We show that existing VQA models have more erroneous\nbeliefs than previously thought, revealing their intrinsic weaknesses.\nSuggestions are then made on how to address these weaknesses going forward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

Underlying this great advance is a change in\nhow we age, yet our understanding of this change remains limited. Here we\npresent a unique database rich with possibilities to study the human ageing\nprocess: the AgeGuess.org database on people's perceived and chronological\nages. Perceived age (i.e. how old one looks to others) correlates with\nbiological age, a measure of a person's health condition in comparison to the\naverage of same-aged peers. Determining biological age usually involves\nelaborate molecular and cellular biomarkers. Using instead perceived age as a\nbiomarker of biological age enables us to collect large amounts of data on\nbiological age through a citizen science project, where people upload pictures\nof themselves and guess the ages of other people at http://www.ageguess.org. It\nfurthermore allows to collect data retrospectively, because people can upload\nphotographs of themselves when they were younger or of their parents and\ngrandparents. We can thus study the temporal variation in the gap between\nperceived age and chronological age to address questions such as whether we now\nage slower or delay ageing until older ages. The here presented perceived age\ndata span birth cohorts from the years 1877 to 2014. Since 2012 the database\nhas grown to now contain around 200,000 perceived age guesses.

According to\nthis model, the electron is not point-like, but rather an \"entity\" formed by a\nfast periodic motion of a quantum whose energy is equal to the rest energy of\nthe electron. Only after a time span equal to the period of that periodic\nmotion the \"entity\" becomes the electron, with its properties, mass, spin,\ncharge, etc.. When in motion with respect to the observer, the \"dynamic\nsubstructure\" of the electron described in this way, leads to a certain time\nstructure of its detection probability, if the space-time point of detection is\ntaken as the space-time point of the quantum. In the typical \"two slit\"\nexperimental situation, this leads to a periodic detection probability with a\nfrequency of twice the De Broglie frequency. This result is identical to the\nresult obtained by the quantum mechanical description of the moving electron by\nthe free particle wave function. The different interpretations of the\nestablished interference pattern, inherent in the two alternative theoretical\ndescriptions is outlined, and the relation between the two descriptions\ndiscussed. It is concluded that quantum interference is well explained with\nclassical probabilities, without quantum mechanics and without paradoxes.
