Most of the empirical neuroscience\nresearch on working memory has focused on measuring sustained activity in\nprefrontal cortex (PFC) and/or parietal cortex during simple delayed-response\ntasks, and most of the models of working memory have been based on neural\nintegrators. But working memory means much more than just holding a piece of\ninformation online. We describe a new theory of working memory, based on a\nrecurrent neural circuit that we call ORGaNICs (Oscillatory Recurrent GAted\nNeural Integrator Circuits). ORGaNICs are a variety of Long Short Term Memory\nunits (LSTMs), imported from machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nORGaNICs can be used to explain the complex dynamics of delay-period activity\nin prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a working memory task. The theory is\nanalytically tractable so that we can characterize the dynamics, and the theory\nprovides a means for reading out information from the dynamically varying\nresponses at any point in time, in spite of the complex dynamics. ORGaNICs can\nbe implemented with a biophysical (electrical circuit) model of pyramidal\ncells, combined with shunting inhibition via a thalamocortical loop. Although\nintroduced as a computational theory of working memory, ORGaNICs are also\napplicable to models of sensory processing, motor preparation and motor\ncontrol. ORGaNICs offer computational advantages compared to other varieties of\nLSTMs that are commonly used in AI applications. Consequently, ORGaNICs are a\nframework for canonical computation in brains and machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 16:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 20:04:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 15:55:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 18:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

Moreover, the `nonlinear' mapping from parameters to\nobservables generally gives rise to non-Gaussian posteriors even with Gaussian\npriors, thus hampering the use of efficient inversion algorithms designed for\nmodels with Gaussian assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian\nstochastic inversion methodology, characterized by a tight coupling between a\ngradient-based Langevin Markov Chain Monte Carlo (LMCMC) method and a kernel\nprincipal component analysis (KPCA). This approach addresses the\n`curse-of-dimensionality' via KPCA to identify a low-dimensional feature space\nwithin the high-dimensional and nonlinearly correlated spatial random field.\nMoreover, non-Gaussian full posterior probability distribution functions are\nestimated via an efficient LMCMC method on both the projected low-dimensional\nfeature space and the recovered high-dimensional parameter space.

We first hypothesise and confirm that plant part\nimage features such as color and texture become more similar to the empirical\ndomain after translation of the synthetic images.Results confirm this with an\nimproved mean color distribution correlation with the empirical data prior of\n0.62 and post translation of 0.90. Furthermore, the mean image features of\ncontrast, homogeneity, energy and entropy moved closer to the empirical mean,\npost translation. In Part II, 7 experiments were performed using convolutional\nneural networks with different combinations of synthetic, synthetic translated\nto empirical and empirical images. We hypothesised that the translated images\ncan be used for (i) improved learning of empirical images, and (ii) that\nlearning without any fine-tuning with empirical images is improved by\nbootstrapping with translated images over bootstrapping with synthetic images.\nResults confirm our second and third hypotheses.

This process transforms\nthe problem into an equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem. However, there\nare some situations in which is more convenient to replace linearizations by\nother low degree matrix polynomials. This has motivated the idea of a strong\n$\\ell$-ification of a matrix polynomial, which is a matrix polynomial of degree\n$\\ell$ having the same finite and infinite elementary divisors, and the same\nnumbers of left and right minimal indices as the original matrix polynomial. We\npresent in this work a novel method for constructing strong $\\ell$-ifications\nof matrix polynomials of size $m\\times n$ and grade $d$ when $\\ell< d$, and\n$\\ell$ divides $nd$ or $md$.

The study of Gromov hyperbolicity for geodesic metric spaces can be\nreduced to the study of graph hyperbolicity. The main contribution of this\npaper is a new characterization of the hyperbolicity of graphs. This\ncharacterization has algorithmic implications in the field of large-scale\nnetwork analysis. A sharp estimate of graph hyperbolicity is useful, e.g., in\nembedding an undirected graph into hyperbolic space with minimum distortion\n[Verbeek and Suri, SoCG'14]. The hyperbolicity of a graph can be computed in\npolynomial-time, however it is unlikely that it can be done in subcubic time.\nThis makes this parameter difficult to compute or to approximate on large\ngraphs. Using our new characterization of graph hyperbolicity, we provide a\nsimple factor 8 approximation algorithm for computing the hyperbolicity of an\n$n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$ in optimal time $O(n^2)$ (assuming that the input is\nthe distance matrix of the graph). This algorithm leads to constant factor\napproximations of other graph-parameters related to hyperbolicity (thinness,\nslimness, and insize). We also present the first efficient algorithms for exact\ncomputation of these parameters. All of our algorithms can be used to\napproximate the hyperbolicity of a geodesic metric space.\n  We also show that a similar characterization of hyperbolicity holds for all\ngeodesic metric spaces endowed with a geodesic spanning tree.

While state-of-the art\nsimulations excel at reproducing galactic disk properties, many struggle to\ndrive strong galactic winds or to match the observed ionization structure of\nthe CGM using only thermal supernova feedback. To remedy this, recent studies\nhave invoked non-thermal cosmic ray (CR) stellar feedback prescriptions.\nHowever, numerical schemes of CR transport are still poorly constrained. We\nexplore how the choice of CR transport affects the multiphase structure of the\nsimulated CGM. We implement anisotropic CR physics in the astrophysical\nsimulation code, {\\sc Enzo} and simulate a suite of isolated disk galaxies with\nvarying prescriptions for CR transport: isotropic diffusion, anisotropic\ndiffusion, and streaming. We find that all three transport mechanisms result in\nstrong, metal-rich outflows but differ in the temperature and ionization\nstructure of their CGM. Isotropic diffusion results in a spatially uniform,\nwarm CGM that underpredicts the column densities of low-ions. Anisotropic\ndiffusion develops a reservoir of cool gas that extends further from the\ngalactic center, but disperses rapidly with distance. CR streaming projects\ncool gas out to radii of 200 kpc, supporting a truly multiphase medium. In\naddition, we find that streaming is less sensitive to changes in constant\nparameter values like the CR injection fraction, transport velocity, and\nresolution than diffusion. We conclude that CR streaming is a more robust\nimplementation of CR transport and motivate the need for detailed parameter\nstudies of CR transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 18:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

These \"nitrogen-rich\" (N-rich) quasars are a\nlong-standing puzzle because their interstellar medium implies stellar\npopulations with abnormally high metallicities. It has recently been proposed\nthat N-rich quasars may result from tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars by\nsupermassive black holes. The rapid enhancement of nitrogen and the depletion\nof carbon due to the carbon--nitrogen--oxygen cycle in supersolar mass stars\ncould naturally produce high N/C. However, the TDE hypothesis predicts that the\nN/C should change with time, which has never hitherto been observed. Here we\nreport the discovery of the first N-rich quasar with rapid N/C variability that\ncould be caused by a TDE. Two spectra separated by 1.7 years (rest-frame) show\nthat the N III]\\lambda 1750/C III]\\lambda 1909 intensity ratio decayed by\n~86%+/-14% (1 \\sigma). Optical (rest-frame UV) light-curve and X-ray\nobservations are qualitatively consistent with the TDE hypothesis; though, the\ntime baseline falls short of a definitive proof. Putting the single-object\ndiscovery into context, statistical analyses of the ~80 known N-rich quasars\nwith high-quality archival spectra show evidence (at a 5\\sigma\\ significance\nlevel) of a decrease in N/C on timescales of >1 year (rest-frame) and a\nconstant level of ionization (indicated by the C III]\\lambda 1909/C IV\\lambda\n1549 intensity ratio).

While our results\nfocus on AOs, the formalism we present generalizes e-ph calculations to\narbitrary localized basis sets, with WFs recovered as a special case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 19:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The fundamental\nassumption of activity-based models is that travel demand is originated from\npeople performing their daily activities. This is why they include a consistent\nrepresentation of time, of the persons and households, time-dependent routing,\nand microsimulation of travel demand and traffic. In spite of their potential\nto simulate traffic demand management policies, their practical application is\nstill limited. One of the main reasons is that these models require a huge\namount of very detailed input data hard to get with surveys. However, the\npervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source of data. The\nwork presented here has a twofold objective: first, to demonstrate the\ncapability of mobile phone records to feed activity-based transport models,\nand, second, to assert the advantages of using activity-based models to\nestimate the effects of traffic demand management policies. Activity diaries\nfor the metropolitan area of Barcelona are reconstructed from mobile phone\nrecords. This information is then employed as input for building a transport\nMATSim model of the city. The model calibration and validation process proves\nthe quality of the activity diaries obtained. The possible impacts of a cordon\ntoll policy applied to two different areas of the city and at different times\nof the day is then studied. Our results show the way in which the modal share\nis modified in each of the considered scenario. The possibility of evaluating\nthe effects of the policy at both aggregated and traveller level, together with\nthe ability of the model to capture policy impacts beyond the cordon toll area\nconfirm the advantages of activity-based models for the evaluation of traffic\ndemand management policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 19:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

This naturally predicts that a nuclear disk accreting\nat rates exceeding $1000 M_{\\odot}$/yr, as seen in the simulations, is stable\nagainst fragmentation irrespective of its metallicity. This is at variance with\nconventional direct collapse scenarios, which require the suppression of gas\ncooling in metal-free protogalaxies for gas collapse to take place. Such high\naccretion rates reflect the high free-fall velocities in massive halos\nappearing at $z < 10$, and occur naturally as a result of the efficient angular\nmomentum loss provided by mergers. We discuss the implications of our scenario\non the observed population of high-z quasars and on its evolution to lower\nredshifts using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. Finally, we consider\nthe intriguing possibility that the secondary gas inflows in the unstable disks\nmight drive gas to collapse into a supermassive black hole directly via the\nGeneral Relativistic radial instability. Such {\\it dark collapse} route could\ngenerate gravitational wave emission detectable via the future Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

Over the past\ndecade, machine learning has established itself as a powerful tool in many\nprediction applications, but this approach is still not widely adopted in\nempirical economic studies. To evaluate the benefits of this approach, I use\nthe most common machine learning algorithms, CART, C4.5, LASSO, random forest,\nand adaboost, to construct prediction models for a cash transfer experiment\nconducted by the Progresa program in Mexico, and I compare the prediction\nresults with those of a previous structural econometric study.

For the out-of-sample forecast, both the mean\nabsolute error and the root mean square error of the school attendance rates\nfound by all machine learning models are smaller than those found by the\nstructural model.

Spatially-coupled (SC)\ncodes are a family of graph-based codes with capacity approaching performance\nand low latency decoding. An SC code is constructed by partitioning an\nunderlying block code to several component matrices, and coupling copies of the\ncomponent matrices together.

Assuming a present value of w equals -.98,\nwe predict a current variation of G dot/G = -.06 H0. H0 is Hubbles parameter, G\nis Newtons constant and G dot is the derivative of G with respect to time.\nThus, G has a cosmic origin, is decreasing with respect to cosmological time,\nand is proportional to H0, as originally proposed by the Dirac-Jordan\nhypothesis. Within our model, we can explain the cosmological constant\nfine-tuning problem, the discrepancy between the present very weak value of the\ncosmological constant, and the much greater vacuum energy found in earlier\nepochs. To formalize and solidify our model, we give two distinct functions of\nG(a), the cosmic scale parameter. We treat inverse G as an order parameter,\nwhich vanishes at high energies; at low temperatures, it reaches a saturation\nvalue, a value we are close to today. Our first function for inverse G is\nmotivated by a charging capacitor; the second treats inverse G by analogy to a\nmagnetic response. Both functions, even though very distinct, give a remarkably\nsimilar tracking behavior for w(a). Interestingly, both functions indicate the\nonset of G formation at a temperature of approximately 7 *1021 degrees Kelvin,\nin contrast to the concordance model. At the temperature of formation, we find\nthat G has increased to roughly 4*1020 times its present value. For most of\ncosmic evolution, however, our variable G model gives results similar to the\npredictions of the concordance model, except in the very early universe, as we\nshall demonstrate. Within our framework, the weakening of G to its current\nvalue G0 is speculated as the true cause for the observed unanticipated\nacceleration of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2018 00:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

The microwave scattering diagnostic observes poloidal $k_{\\theta}$\nvalues of 3.3 cm$^{-1}$, averaged over a 20 cm region at the plasma edge.A\nshort autoregressive filter enhances the nonstationary component of the plasma\nfluctuations by removing much of the background level of stationary\nfluctuations. Between ELMs, the spectrum predominantly consists of broad-banded\n300-700 kHz fluctuations propagating in the electron diamagnetic drift\ndirection, indicating the presence of a negative electric field near the plasma\nedge. The time-frequency spectrogram is computed with the multiple taper\ntechnique. By using the singular value decomposition of the spectrogram, it is\nshown that the spectrum during the ELM is broader and more symmetric than that\nof the stationary spectrum. The ELM period and the evolution of the spectrum\nbetween ELMs varies from discharge to discharge. For the discharge under\nconsideration which has distinct ELMs with a 1 msec period, the spectrum has a\nmaximum in the electron drift direction which relaxes to a near constant value\n%its characteristic shape in the first half millisecond after the end of the\nELM and then grows slowly.

However, these techniques\nare time consuming and their convergence to the posterior could be difficult to\ndetermine. In this work, we advocate Variational inference as an alternative to\nsolve the above problems, and demonstrate its usefulness for parameter\nestimation and model selection in Astrophysics. Variational inference converts\nthe inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating the\nposterior from a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence to characterize the difference. It takes advantage of fast\noptimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal with large datasets and\nmakes it trivial to parallelize on a multicore platform. We also derive a new\napproximate evidence estimation based on variational posterior, and importance\nsampling technique called posterior weighted importance sampling for the\ncalculation of evidence (PWISE), which is useful to perform Bayesian model\nselection. As a proof of principle, we apply variational inference to five\ndifferent problems in astrophysics, where Monte Carlo techniques were\npreviously used. These include assessment of significance of annual modulation\nin the COSINE-100 dark matter experiment, measuring exoplanet orbital\nparameters from radial velocity data, tests of periodicities in measurements of\nNewton's constant $G$, assessing the significance of a turnover in the spectral\nlag data of GRB 160625B and estimating the mass of a galaxy cluster using weak\ngravitational lensing.

Our main results establish a hidden\nintegrality property of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for this\nproblem: while the optimal solution to the SDP is not integer-valued in\ngeneral, its estimation error can be upper bounded by that of an idealized\ninteger program. The error of the integer program, and hence that of the SDP,\nare further shown to decay exponentially in the signal-to-noise ratio. In\naddition, we show that the SDP relaxation is robust under the semi-random\nsetting in which an adversary can modify the data generated from the mixture\nmodel. In particular, we generalize the hidden integrality property to the\nsemi-random model and thereby show that SDP achieves the optimal error bound in\nthis setting. These results together highlight the \"global-to-local\" mechanism\nthat drives the performance of the SDP relaxation.\n  To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first exponentially decaying\nerror bound for convex relaxations of mixture models.

Optical based\nones, use light source and an optical detector. Droplet crossing the light\ncreates shadow on the detector. This change in the intensity and duration of\nchange provides the size and speed of the droplet. Whereas the impact based\nmethod utilizes peizo elements to sense the droplet by physical momentum\ntransfer at the time of droplets impact with the sensor. Apart from the\ntechnical differences in them, both of these disdrometers fall in the similar\ncost range. Wind turbulence sensors works on detection of gradients in wind\nspeeds by employing various working principles like thermal anemometer, laser\nDoppler anemometer, etc. In thermo anemometers, a heating element is maintained\nat a constant temperature. As the wind flows, it carries some heat energy away\nfrom the element. This causes a change in the resistance in the heating element\nproviding further change in voltages across it. Laser Doppler anemometers work\non change in wavelength of light scattered by a moving particle which is caught\nin the wind flow. These techniques are highly accurate in measuring the\nturbulence in the air but at elevated costs. Aimed at cost efficacy and\nacceptable performance of the device, a novel concept was implemented in a\nsingle device to study its feasibility to work as a disdrometer and a\nturbulence sensor. It employs the principles of electromagnetic induction and\nresponse of a cantilever to impulses. Based on these principles, a device was\ndesigned and fabricated to detect rain droplet size and wind turbulence. It was\nfabricated from readily available materials. The testing of the device in\nlaboratory conditions yielded satisfactory results as compare to the standard\ncommercial instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2018 13:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}
