However, very few experimental techniques can be used to measure\nin-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity. A beam-offset method based on\ntime-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) was previously proposed to measure\nin-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity. However, a detailed analysis of the\nbeam-offset method is still lacking. Our analysis shows that uncertainties can\nbe large if the laser spot size or the modulation frequency is not properly\nchosen. Here we propose an alternative approach based on TDTR to measure\nin-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity using a highly elliptical pump\n(heating) beam. The highly elliptical pump beam induces a quasi-one-dimensional\ntemperature profile on the sample surface that has a fast decay along the short\naxis of the pump beam. The detected TDTR signal is exclusively sensitive to the\nin-plane thermal conductivity along the short axis of the elliptical beam. By\nconducting TDTR measurements as a function of delay time with the rotation of\nthe elliptical pump beam to different orientations, the in-plane thermal\nconductivity tensor of the sample can be determined. In this work, we first\nconduct detailed signal sensitivity analyses for both techniques and provide\nguidelines in determining the optimal experimental conditions. We then compare\nthe two techniques under their optimal experimental conditions by measuring the\nin-plane thermal conductivity tensor of a ZnO [11-20] sample.

At first, the stability of several\nperiodic domain patterns with in-plane polarizations is tested under\nstress-free and electric field-free conditions. It is found that simple domain\npatterns with stripe-like features are stable, while patterns with more complex\ndomain configurations are typically unstable at the nanoscale. Upon identifying\na stable domain pattern with suitable properties, a conceptual design of a thin\nfilm energy harvester device is explored. The harvester is modelled as a thin\nferroelectric film bound to a substrate. In the initial state a periodic stripe\ndomain pattern with zero net charge on the top electrode is modelled. On\nbending the substrate, a mechanical strain is induced in the film, causing\npolarized domains to undergo ferroelectric switching and thus generate\nelectrical energy. The results demonstrate the working cycle of a conceptual\nenergy harvester which, on operating at kHz frequencies, such as from\nvibrations in the environment, could produce an area power density of about\n40W/m2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2018 20:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

However, when these\nlaminates (formed in a macroscopic crystal) comprise domains that are a few\nnanometers in size, the domain-wall energy becomes significant, and the\nbehaviour of laminate patterns at this scale is not known. Here, a phase-field\nmodel, which accounts for gradient energy and strain energy contributions, is\nemployed to explore the stability and evolution of the nanoscale multi-rank\nlaminates. The stress, electric field, and domain wall energies in the\nlaminates are computed. The effect of scaling is also discussed.

While low-order SCEs have\nbeen remarkably successful in describing the dynamics of non-equilibrium\nmany-body systems (e.g., the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation), its convergence\nproperties have not been elucidated before.

ABC uses a simulation-based\nnon-parametric estimate of the likelihood of a summary statistic and assumes\nthat the generation of data from the model is computationally cheap. This\nchapter reviews two alternative approaches for estimating the intractable\nlikelihood, with the goal of reducing the necessary model simulations to\nproduce an approximate posterior. The first of these is a Bayesian version of\nthe synthetic likelihood (SL), initially developed by Wood (2010), which uses a\nmultivariate normal approximation to the summary statistic likelihood. Using\nthe parametric approximation as opposed to the non-parametric approximation of\nABC, it is possible to reduce the number of model simulations required. The\nsecond likelihood approximation method we consider in this chapter is based on\nthe empirical likelihood (EL), which is a non-parametric technique and involves\nmaximising a likelihood constructed empirically under a set of moment\nconstraints. Mengersen et al (2013) adapt the EL framework so that it can be\nused to form an approximate posterior for problems where ABC can be applied,\nthat is, for models with intractable likelihoods. However, unlike ABC and the\nBayesian SL (BSL), the Bayesian EL (BCel) approach can be used to completely\navoid model simulations in some cases.

The main reason\nis that we are lacking of control over the view update strategy to deal with\ninherited ambiguity of view update for a given view.\n  This vision paper aims to provide a new language-based approach to\ncontrolling and integrating decentralized data based on the view, and establish\na software foundation for systematic construction of such data management\nsystems. Our key observation is that a view should be defined through a view\nupdate strategy rather than a query. In other words, the view definition should\nbe extracted from the view update strategy, which is in sharp contrast to the\ntraditional approaches where the view update strategy is derived from the view\ndefinition.\n  In this paper, we present the first programmable architecture with a\ndeclarative language for specifying update strategies over views, whose unique\nview definition can be automatically derived, and show how it can be\neffectively used to control data access, integrate data generally allowing\ncoexistence of GAV (global as view) and LAV (local as view), and perform both\nanalysis and updates on the integrated data. We demonstrate its usefulness\nthrough development of a privacy-preserving ride-sharing alliance system,\ndiscuss its application scope, and highlight future challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 15:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

As each point is received, the algorithm assigns this new point to a\nchain in an irrevocable manner and this assignment is made without knowledge of\nfuture points. Kierstead presented an algorithm using $(5^w-1)/4$ chains to\ncover each poset of width $w$. Felsner proved that width $2$ posets can be\npartitioned on-line into $5$ chains. We present an algorithm using $16$ chains\non posets of width $3$. This result significantly narrows down the previous\nbound of $31$. Moreover, we address the on-line chain partitioning problem for\ninterval orders. Kierstead and Trotter presented an algorithm using $3w-2$\nchains.

We study a class of harvest-first-transmit-later type of WPT\npolicy, where an access point (AP) first employs RF power transfer to recharge\na wireless powered device (WPD) for a certain period subjected to optimization,\nand then, the harvested energy is subsequently used by the WPD to transmit its\ndata bits back to the AP over a finite horizon. A significant challenge\nregarding the studied WPT scenario is the time-varying nature of the wireless\nchannel linking the WPD to the AP. We first investigate as a benchmark the\noffline case where the channel realizations are known non-causally prior to the\nstarting of the horizon. For the offline case, by finding the optimal WPT\nduration and power allocations in the data transmission period, we derive an\nupper bound on the throughput of the WPD. We then focus on the online\ncounterpart of the problem where the channel realizations are known causally.\nWe prove that the optimal WPT duration obeys a time-dependent threshold form\ndepending on the energy state of the WPD. In the subsequent data transmission\nstage, the optimal transmit power allocation for the WPD is shown to be of a\nfractional structure where at each time slot a fraction of energy depending on\nthe current channel and a measure of future channel state expectations is\nallocated for data transmission. We numerically show that the online policy\nperforms almost identical to the upper bound. We then consider a data sensing\napplication, where the WPD adjusts the sensing resolution to balance between\nthe quality of the sensed data and the probability of successfully delivering\nit. We use Bayesian inference as a reinforcement learning method to provide a\nmean for the WPD in learning to balance the sensing resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2018 19:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 21:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

However, there are substantial statistical challenges in sizing\nSMART designs due to the complex correlation structure between the DTRs\nembedded in the design. Since the primary goal of SMARTs is the construction of\nan optimal DTR, investigators are interested in sizing SMARTs based on the\nability to screen out DTRs inferior to the optimal DTR by a given amount which\ncannot be done using existing methods.
