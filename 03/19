In this setup one needs a limited set of magnetic configurations to\ndistinguish ferromag- netic, skyrmion and spin spiral phases, as well as their\ndifferent combinations in transitional areas of the phase diagram. The network\ntrained on the configurations for square-lattice Heisenberg model with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can classify the magnetic structures obtained\nfrom Monte Carlo calculations for triangular lattice and vice versa.

There is actually circumstantial evidence that most\nplanetary systems become unstable after the disappearance of gas from the\nprotoplanetary disk. These instabilities can be due to the original system\nbeing too crowded and too closely packed or to external perturbations such as\ntides, planetesimal scattering, or torques from distant stellar companions. The\nSolar System was not exceptional in this sense. In its inner part, a crowded\nsystem of planetary embryos became unstable, leading to a series of mutual\nimpacts that built the terrestrial planets on a timescale of ~100 My. In its\nouter part, the giant planets became temporarily unstable and their orbital\nconfiguration expanded under the effect of mutual encounters. A planet might\nhave been ejected in this phase. Thus, the orbital distributions of planetary\nsystems that we observe today, both solar and extrasolar ones, can be different\nfrom the those emerging from the formation process and it is important to\nconsider possible long-term evolutionary effects to connect the two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 17:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The economics of long\ndistance transmission lines prevent many remote communities from connecting to\nbulk transmission systems and these communities rely on off-grid microgrid\ntechnology. Furthermore, communities that are connected to the bulk\ntransmission system are investigating microgrid technologies that will support\ntheir ability to disconnect and operate independently during extreme events. In\neach of these cases, it is important to develop methodologies that support the\ncapability to design and operate microgrids in the absence of transmission over\nlong periods of time. Unfortunately, such planning problems tend to be\ncomputationally difficult to solve and those that are straightforward to solve\noften lack the modeling fidelity that inspires confidence in the results. To\naddress these issues, we first develop a high fidelity model for design and\noperations of a microgrid that include component efficiencies, component\noperating limits, battery modeling, unit commitment, capacity expansion, and\npower flow physics; the resulting model is a mixed-integer\nquadratically-constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP).

The initial\nconditions are a disc of gas and microscopic solid particles, with a total mass\nof about 1% of the gas mass. Accretion has to be effective and fast. Effective,\nbecause the original total mass in solids in the solar protoplanetary disk was\nprobably of the order of ~ 300 Earth masses, and the mass incorporated into the\nplanets is ~100 Earth masses. Fast, because the cores of the giant planets had\nto grow to tens of Earth masses in order to capture massive doses of hydrogen\nand helium from the disc before the dispersal of the latter, i.e. in a few\nmillions of years. There is probably not one accretion process but several,\ndepending on the scale at which accretion operates. A first process is the\nsticking of microscopic dust into larger grains and pebbles. A second process\nis the formation of an intermediate class of objects called planetesimals. A\nthird accretion process has to lead from planetesimals to planets. Actually,\nseveral processes can be involved in this step, from collisional coagulation\namong planetesimals to the accretion of small particles under the effect of gas\ndrag, to giant impacts between protoplanets. This chapter will detail all these\nprocesses, adopting a historical perspective: i.e. from the classic processes\ninvestigated in the past decades to those unveiled in the last years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 18:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

However, in a dynamic environment that unfolds over\ntime, the agents' intertemporal payoffs depend on the expected future controls\nand payments, and a direct extension of the VCG mechanism is not sufficient to\nguarantee incentive compatibility. In fact, it does not appear to be feasible\nto construct mechanisms that ensure the dominance of dynamic truth-telling for\nagents comprised of general stochastic dynamic systems. The contribution of\nthis paper is to show that such a dynamic stochastic extension does exist for\nthe special case of Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) agents with a careful\nconstruction of a sequence of layered payments over time. For a set of LQG\nagents, we propose a modified layered version of the VCG mechanism for payments\nthat decouples the intertemporal effect of current bids on future payoffs, and\nprove that truth-telling of dynamic states forms a dominant strategy if system\nparameters are known and agents are rational.\n  An important example of a problem needing such optimal dynamic coordination\nof stochastic agents arises in power systems where an Independent System\nOperator (ISO) has to ensure balance of generation and consumption at all time\ninstants, while ensuring social optimality.

First the\nmethodology for modeling and calibrating both bulk-type and stack-type SMB is\nsummarized.

Due to the need of quality assurance and the\nbenefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of\nreproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software\nrepositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the\nunreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge,\nbecause of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of\nthe causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries.\n  In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the\nproblematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query\naugmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build\nlogs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search\nscope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module,\nRepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful\nin locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have\nimplemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world\nunreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the\ntopmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we\nexpand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by\nRepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds\nof source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly\nreduces the scope of localizing problematic files.

We find that the bulk\ngas can become depleted in heavy nitrogen (15N) due to the formation of\n15N-enriched ices. Around the chemical transition from atomic nitrogen to N2,\nN15N is selectively photodissociated, which results in the enrichment of 15N in\natomic nitrogen. As 15N-enriched atomic nitrogen is converted to ammonia ice\nvia grain surface reactions, the bulk gas is depleted in 15N. The level of 15N\ndepletion in the bulk gas can be up to a factor of two compared to the\nelemental nitrogen isotope ratio, depending on the photodesorption yield of\nammonia ice. Once the nitrogen isotopes are differentially partitioned between\ngas and solids in a molecular cloud, it should remain in the later stages of\nstar formation (e.g., prestellar core) as long as the sublimation of ammonia\nice is inefficient. Our model suggests that all the N-bearing molecules in the\ncold gas of star-forming regions can be depleted in 15N, which is at least\nqualitatively consistent with the observations toward prestellar core L1544.

The $B-L$ gauge symmetry breaking generates the\nMajorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos. We introduce a Z$_2$ symmetry\nto the model and assign an odd parity only for one right-handed neutrino, and\nhence the Z$_2$-odd right-handed neutrino is stable and the unique dark matter\ncandidate in the model. The so-called minimal seesaw works with the other two\nright-handed neutrinos and reproduces the current neutrino oscillation data. We\nconsider the case that the dark matter particle communicates with the SM\nparticles through the $B-L$ gauge boson ($Z^{\\prime}_{B-L}$ boson), and obtain\na lower bound on the $B-L$ gauge coupling ($\\alpha_{B-L}$) as a function of the\n$Z^{\\prime}_{B-L}$ boson mass ($m_{Z^{\\prime}}$) from the observed dark matter\nrelic density.

In this paper\nwe advocate for the thesis that there is a much deeper relationship between\ncomputational topology and the Unique Games Conjecture. Our starting point is\nLinial's 2005 observation that the only known problems whose inapproximability\nis equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture - Unique Games and Max-2Lin - are\ninstances of Maximum Section of a Covering Space on graphs. We then observe\nthat the reduction between these two problems (Khot-Kindler-Mossel-O'Donnell,\nFOCS 2004; SICOMP, 2007) gives a well-defined map of covering spaces. We\nfurther prove that inapproximability for Maximum Section of a Covering Space on\n(cell decompositions of) closed 2-manifolds is also equivalent to the Unique\nGames Conjecture. This gives the first new \"Unique Games-complete\" problem in\nover a decade.\n  Our results partially settle an open question of Chen and Freedman (SODA\n2010; Disc. Comput. Geom., 2011) from computational topology, by showing that\ntheir question is almost equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture. (The main\ndifference is that they ask for inapproximability over\n$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and we show Unique Games-completeness over\n$\\mathbb{Z}/k\\mathbb{Z}$ for large $k$.) This equivalence comes from the fact\nthat when the structure group $G$ of the covering space is Abelian - or more\ngenerally for principal $G$-bundles - Maximum Section of a $G$-Covering Space\nis the same as the well-studied problem of 1-Homology Localization.\n  Although our most technically demanding result is an application of Unique\nGames to computational topology, we hope that our observations on the\ntopological nature of the Unique Games Conjecture will lead to applications of\nalgebraic topology to the Unique Games Conjecture in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 04:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

This modeling abstracts away from states of an automaton;\nit can thus be thought of as the \"behaviors\" of systems with the Buechi or\nparity conditions, in a way that follows the tradition of coalgebraic modeling\nof system behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 06:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

With their simple\nstructure they can explain a variety of effects, ranging from insulating and\nmetallic behaviours to superconductivity and the integer quantum Hall effect.\nInteractions, e.g. in the form of Coulomb repulsion, can dramatically alter\nthis picture by giving rise to emerging physics that may not resemble free\nfermions. Examples of such phenomena include high-temperature\nsuperconductivity, fractional quantum Hall effect, Kondo effect and quantum\nspin liquids.

Therefore they loose their meaning for macroscopic systems, a\npoint stressed in particular by W. Kohn. The EWP has to be resolved in order to\nbe able to perform electronic structure calculations, e.g., for solids. The\norigin of the EWP is the multiplicative property of wavefunctions when\nindependent subsystems are considered. Therefore it can only be avoided when\nwavefunctions are formulated so that they are additive instead, in particular\nwhen matrix elements involving them are calculated. We describe how this is\ndone for the ground state of a macroscopic electron system. Going over from a\nmultiplicative to an additive quantity requires taking a logarithm. Here it\nimplies going over from Hilbert space to the operator- or Liouville space with\na metric based on cumulants. The operators which define the ground-state\nwavefunction generate fluctuations from a mean-field state. The latter does not\nsuffer from an EWP and therefore may serve as a vacuum state. The fluctuations\nhave to be {\\it connected} like the ones caused by pair interactions in a\nclassical gas when the free energy is calculated (Meyer's cluster expansion).\nThis fixes the metric in Liouville space. The scheme presented here provides a\nsolid basis for electronic structure calculations for the ground state of\nsolids. In fact, its applicability has already been proven. We discuss also\nmatrix product states, which have been applied to one-dimensional systems with\nresults of high precision. Although these states are formulated in Hilbert\nspace they are processed by using operators in Liouville space. We show that\nthey fit into the general formalism described above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 09:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

It is proposed that the distribution of magnetic strength\nalong the loop rather than density stratification is responsible for this\ndeviation. The variation in period and distribution of amplitude provide, in\nterms of SMS, a new and unprecedented insight into coronal loop diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 09:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

The creation of public policies, however,\nis complex given the perspective of large and diverse stakeholders involvement,\nconsiderable human participation, lengthy processes, complex task specification\nand the non-deterministic nature of the process. The inherent complexities of\nthe policy process impart challenges for designing a computing system that\nassists in supporting and automating the business process pertaining to policy\nsetup, which also raises concerns for setting up a tracking service in the\npolicy-making environment. A tracking service informs how decisions have been\ntaken during policy creation and can provide useful and intrinsic information\nregarding the policy process. At present, there exists no computing system that\nassists in tracking the complete process that has been employed for policy\ncreation. To design such a system, it is important to consider the policy\nenvironment challenges; for this a novel network and goal based approach has\nbeen framed and is covered in detail in this paper. Furthermore, smart\ngovernance objectives that include stakeholders participation and citizens\ninvolvement have been considered. Thus, the proposed approach has been devised\nby considering smart governance principles and the knowledge environment of\npolicy making where tasks are largely dependent on policy makers decisions and\non individual policy objectives. Our approach reckons the human dimension for\ndeciding and defining autonomous process activities at run time. Furthermore,\nwith the network-based approach, so-called provenance data tracking is employed\nwhich enables the capture of policy process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 09:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

Previously, a catalog of 69 such systems was used in a\none-on-one comparison between the standard model, LCDM, and the R_h=ct\nuniverse, which has thus far been favored by the application of model selection\ntools to many other kinds of data. But in that work, the use of model\nparametric fits to the observations could not easily distinguish between these\ntwo cosmologies, in part due to the limited measurement precision. Here, we\ninstead use recently developed methods based on Gaussian Processes (GP), in\nwhich D_obs may be reconstructed directly from the data without assuming any\nparametric form. This approach not only smooths out the reconstructed function\nrepresenting the data, but also reduces the size of the 1-sigma confidence\nregions, thereby providing greater power to discern between different models.\nWith the current sample size, we show that analyzing strong lenses with a GP\napproach can definitely improve the model comparisons, producing probability\ndifferences in the range ~10-30%. These results are still marginal, however,\ngiven the relatively small sample. Nonetheless, we conclude that the\nprobability of R_h=ct being the correct cosmology is somewhat higher than that\nof LCDM, with a degree of significance that grows with the number of sources in\nthe subsamples we consider. Future surveys will significantly grow the catalog\nof strong lenses and will therefore benefit considerably from the GP method we\ndescribe here. In addition, we point out that if the R_h=ct universe is\neventually shown to be the correct cosmology, the lack of free parameters in\nthe study of strong lenses should provide a remarkably powerful tool for\nuncovering the mass structure in lensing galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 10:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

As such, it is of interest\nto assess how this amplification, defined as the steady-state variance\nmaintained under Gaussian white noise forcing, scales with the main\nnondimensional parameters: the Reynolds ($Re$) and Weissenberg ($Wi$) numbers.\nThis scaling is derived analytically in the two limits of strong and weak\nelasticity for when the forcing is streamwise-constant. The latter is the\nrelevant forcing for capturing the overall behaviour because it was previously\nshown to have the dominant contribution to amplification. The final expressions\nshow that for weak elasticity the scaling retains a form similar to the\nwell-known O($Re^3$) relationship with an added elastic correction. For strong\nelasticity, however, the scaling is O($Wi^3$) with a viscous correction. The\nkey factor leading to such a mirroring in the scaling is the introduction of\nforcing in the polymer stress. The results demonstrate that energy\namplification in a viscoelastic flow can be very sensitive to the model\nparameters even at low $Re$. They also suggest that energy amplification can be\nsignificantly increased by forcing the polymer stress, thereby opening up\npossibilities such as flow control using systematically designed polymer stress\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 11:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

The said\nlattice eventually coincides with the lattice of all orthogonal projectors on a\nseparable Hilbert space over R, C, or over the algebra of quaternions H.\nQuantum states are $\\sigma$-additive probability measures on that non-Boolean\nlattice. Gleason's theorem proves that, if the Hilbert space is separable with\ndimension >2 and the Hilbert space is either real or complex, then states are\none-to-one with standard density matrices (self-adjoint, positive, unit-trace,\ntrace-class operators). The extension of this result to quaternionic Hilbert\nspaces was obtained by Varadarajan in 1968. Unfortunately, even if the hard\npart of the proof is correct, the formulation of this extension is\nmathematically incorrect. This is due to some peculiarities of the notion of\ntrace in quaternionic Hilbert spaces, e.g., basis dependence, making the theory\nof trace-class operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces different from the\nstandard theory in real and complex Hilbert spaces. A minor issue also affects\nVaradarajan's statement for real Hilbert space formulation.

Our\ntheory is inspired by the groundbreaking work of Wu and Verdu (2010) on almost\nlossless analog compression, but applies to the nonasymptotic, i.e., fixed-m\ncase, and considers zero error probability. Specifically, our achievability\nresult states that, for almost all A, the random vector x can be recovered with\nzero error probability provided that n > K(x), where K(x) is given by the\ninfimum of the lower modified Minkowski dimension over all support sets U of x.\nWe then particularize this achievability result to the class of s-rectifiable\nrandom vectors as introduced in Koliander et al. (2016); these are random\nvectors of absolutely continuous distribution---with respect to the\ns-dimensional Hausdorff measure---supported on countable unions of\ns-dimensional differentiable submanifolds of the m-dimensional real coordinate\nspace. Countable unions of differentiable submanifolds include essentially all\nsignal models used in the compressed sensing literature. Specifically, we prove\nthat, for almost all A, s-rectifiable random vectors x can be recovered with\nzero error probability from n>s linear measurements. This threshold is,\nhowever, found not to be tight as exemplified by the construction of an\ns-rectifiable random vector that can be recovered with zero error probability\nfrom n<s linear measurements. This leads us to the introduction of the new\nclass of s-analytic random vectors, which admit a strong converse in the sense\nof n greater than or equal to s being necessary for recovery with probability\nof error smaller than one.

Studies at UV wavelengths showed spectral lines of freshly\nproduced Be-7. This could be measurable also in gamma-rays at 478 keV from the\ndecay to Li-7. Novae are also expected to synthesise Na-22 which decays to\nNe-22, emitting a 1275 keV photon. About one week before the optical maximum, a\nstrong gamma-ray flash on time-scales of hours is expected from short-lived\nradioactive nuclei, such as N-13 and F-18. These beta-plus-unstable nuclei\nshould yield emission up to 511 keV, but which has never been observed. The\nspectrometer SPI aboard INTEGRAL pointed towards V5668 by chance. We use these\nobservations to search for possible gamma-ray emission of decaying Be-7, and to\ndirectly measure the synthesised mass during explosive burning. We also aim to\nconstrain possible burst-like emission days to weeks before the optical maximum\nusing the SPI anticoincidence shield (ACS). We extract spectral and temporal\ninformation to determine the fluxes of gamma-ray lines at 478 keV, 511 keV, and\n1275 keV. A measured flux value directly converts into abundances produced by\nthe nova. The SPI-ACS rates are analysed for burst-like emission using a nova\nmodel light-curve. For the obtained nova flash candidate events, we discuss\npossible origins. No significant excess for the expected gamma-ray lines is\nfound. Our upper limits on the synthesised Be-7 and Na-22 mass depend on the\nuncertainties of the distance to the nova: The Be-7 mass is constrained to less\nthan $4.8\\times10^{-9}\\,(d/kpc)^2$, and Na-22 to less than\n$2.4\\times10^{-8}\\,(d/kpc)^2$ solar masses. For the Be-7 mass estimate from UV\nstudies, the distance to V5668 Sgr must be larger than 1.2 kpc.

However, the differences between the\nlearned solutions of networks which generalize and those which do not remain\nunclear. Additionally, the tuning properties of single directions (defined as\nthe activation of a single unit or some linear combination of units in response\nto some input) have been highlighted, but their importance has not been\nevaluated. Here, we connect these lines of inquiry to demonstrate that a\nnetwork's reliance on single directions is a good predictor of its\ngeneralization performance, across networks trained on datasets with different\nfractions of corrupted labels, across ensembles of networks trained on datasets\nwith unmodified labels, across different hyperparameters, and over the course\nof training. While dropout only regularizes this quantity up to a point, batch\nnormalization implicitly discourages single direction reliance, in part by\ndecreasing the class selectivity of individual units. Finally, we find that\nclass selectivity is a poor predictor of task importance, suggesting not only\nthat networks which generalize well minimize their dependence on individual\nunits by reducing their selectivity, but also that individually selective units\nmay not be necessary for strong network performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:42:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 10:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 10:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 09:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Although\nthese formulas come from large sample asymptotics, we are often told that we\nare on reasonably safe grounds when $n$ is large in such a way that $n \\ge 5p$\nor $n \\ge 10p$. This paper shows that this is far from the case, and\nconsequently, inferences routinely produced by common software packages are\noften unreliable.\n  Consider a logistic model with independent features in which $n$ and $p$\nbecome increasingly large in a fixed ratio.

The bias of the MLE is extremely problematic as it\nyields completely wrong predictions for the probability of a case based on\nobserved values of the covariates. We develop a new theory, which\nasymptotically predicts (1) the bias of the MLE, (2) the variability of the\nMLE, and (3) the distribution of the LRT.

To this end, we propose to improve the\ntransferability of adversarial examples by creating diverse input patterns.\nInstead of only using the original images to generate adversarial examples, our\nmethod applies random transformations to the input images at each iteration.\nExtensive experiments on ImageNet show that the proposed attack method can\ngenerate adversarial examples that transfer much better to different networks\nthan existing baselines. By evaluating our method against top defense solutions\nand official baselines from NIPS 2017 adversarial competition, the enhanced\nattack reaches an average success rate of 73.0%, which outperforms the top-1\nattack submission in the NIPS competition by a large margin of 6.6%.

This requires that logical operators acting on protected\nqubits be translated to physical operators (circuits) acting on physical\nquantum states. We propose a mathematical framework for synthesizing physical\ncircuits that implement logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes.\nCircuit synthesis is enabled by representing the desired physical Clifford\noperator in $\\mathbb{C}^{N \\times N}$ as a partial $2m \\times 2m$ binary\nsymplectic matrix, where $N = 2^m$. We state and prove two theorems that use\nsymplectic transvections to efficiently enumerate all symplectic matrices that\nsatisfy a system of linear equations. As an important corollary of these\nresults, we prove that for an $[\\![ m,m-k ]\\!]$ stabilizer code every logical\nClifford operator has $2^{k(k+1)/2}$ symplectic solutions. The desired physical\ncircuits are then obtained by decomposing each solution as a product of\nelementary symplectic matrices. Our assembly of the possible physical\nrealizations enables optimization over them with respect to a suitable metric.\nFurthermore, we show that any circuit that normalizes the stabilizer of the\ncode can be transformed into a circuit that centralizes the stabilizer, while\nrealizing the same logical operation. Our method of circuit synthesis can be\napplied to any stabilizer code, and this paper provides a proof of concept\nsynthesis of universal Clifford gates for the $[\\![ 6,4,2 ]\\!]$ CSS code.

The bar's rotation speed is\nconstrained to $\\Omega_{\\rm bar}<50$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ taking into account\nthe allowed mass range.\n  We conclude that our basic model is compatible with observations and with the\ndynamical constraints. The model explains simultaneously the bulk of the main\nmoving groups, associated here with the spiral corotation resonance, and the\nHercules stream, associated with several inner high-order spiral resonances; in\nparticular, with the 8/1 resonance. From the dynamical constraints on the bar's\nangular speed, it is unlikely that the bar's OLR lies near the solar circle;\nmoreover, its proximity would compromise the stability of the Local Arm\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 15:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 20:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Here the interplay of\ncharge order with superconductivity in cuprate superconductors is studied based\non the kinetic-energy-driven superconducting (SC) mechanism by taking into\naccount the intertwining between the pseudogap and SC gap. It is shown that the\nappearance of the Fermi pockets is closely associated with the emergence of the\npseudogap. However, the distribution of the spectral weight of the SC-state\nquasiparticle spectrum on the Fermi arc, or equivalently the front side of the\nFermi pocket, and back side of Fermi pocket is extremely anisotropic, where the\nmost part of the spectral weight is located around the tips of the Fermi arcs,\nwhich in this case coincide with the hot spots on the electron Fermi surface\n(EFS). In particular, as charge order in the normal-state, this EFS instability\ndrives charge order in the SC-state, with the charge-order wave vector that is\nwell consistent with the wave vector connecting the hot spots on the straight\nFermi arcs. Furthermore, this charge-order state is doping dependent, with the\ncharge-order wave vector that decreases in magnitude with the increase of\ndoping. Although there is a coexistence of charge order and superconductivity,\nthis charge order antagonizes superconductivity. The results from the SC-state\ndynamical charge structure factor indicate the existence of a quantitative\nconnection between the low-energy electronic structure and collective response\nof the electron density.

One of the\nmost interesting properties of these sensors is the presumed linear\nrelationship between the strain and the peak wavelength shift of the FBG\nreflected spectra. However, subjecting sensors to a non-uniform stress field\nwill in general result in a strain estimation error when using this linear\nrelationship. In this paper we propose a new strain estimation algorithm that\naccurately estimates the mean strain value in the case of smooth non-uniform\nstrain distributions. To do so, we first introduce an approximation of the\nclassical transfer matrix model, which we will refer to as the approximated\ntransfer matrix model (ATMM). This model facilitates the analysis of FBG\nreflected spectra under arbitrary strain distributions, particularly by\nproviding a closed-form approximation of the side-lobes of the reflected\nspectra. Based on this new formulation, we derive a maximum likelihood\nestimator of the mean strain value. The algorithm is validated using both\ncomputer simulations and experimental FBG measurements. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods, which typically introduce errors of tens of\nmicrostrains, the proposed method is able to compensate for this error. In the\ntypical examples that were analysed in this study, mean strain errors of around\n60 microstrains were compensated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 11:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-17"}

There are numerous sensors among the\nelectrical and electronics devices on an aircraft, most of which are essential\nfor the proper functioning of the same. With the sensors being operational\nthroughout the time of movement of the aircraft, a large amount of data is\ncollected during each flight. Normally, most of the gathered data are stored on\na storage device on the aircraft, and are analyzed and studied later off-site\nfor research purposes focusing on improving airline operation and efficiently\nmaintaining the same.

Association rule learning is the most popular\ntechnique to discover rules utilizing large datasets. However, it is well-known\nthat a large proportion of association rules generated are redundant. This\nredundant production makes not only the rule-set unnecessarily large but also\nmakes the decision making process more complex and ineffective. In this paper,\nwe propose an approach that effectively identifies the redundancy in\nassociations and extracts a concise set of behavioral association rules that\nare non-redundant. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is examined by\nconsidering the real mobile phone datasets of individual users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 04:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

So far,\nmost of the work in this field has been focused on achieving static colors,\nlimiting many potential applications. This inevitably calls for the development\nof dynamic color displays with advanced and innovative functionalities. In this\nLetter, we demonstrate a novel dynamic color printing scheme using\nmagnesium-based pixelated Fabry-Perot cavities by grey-scale nanolithography.\nWith controlled hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, magnesium undergoes unique\nmetal and dielectric transitions, enabling distinct blank and color states from\nthe pixelated Fabry-Perot resonators. Following such a scheme, we first\ndemonstrate dynamic Ishihara plates, in which the encrypted images can only be\nread out using hydrogen as information decoding key. We also demonstrate a new\ntype of dynamic color generation, which enables fascinating transformations\nbetween black/white printing and color printing with fine tonal tuning. Our\nwork will find wide-ranging applications in full-color printing and displays,\ncolorimetric sensing, information encryption and anti-counterfeiting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 22:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}

The quadratic\nproblem is considered with quadratic inequality constraints with bounded\ncontinuous and discrete mixed variables. The $\\rho$-convex problem is\nconsidered with $\\rho$-convex inequality constraints in mixed variables. The\nquadratic fractional problem is studied with quadratic fractional constraints\nin mixed variables. For all three problems we reformulate the problem as a\nmathematical programming problem and apply standard Karush Kuhn Tucker\nnecessary conditions. Then, for each problem, we provide local necessary\noptimality condition. Further, for each problem a Lagrangian multiplier\nsufficient optimality condition is provided to identify global minimizer among\nthe local minimizers. For the quadratic problem underestimation of a Lagrangian\nwas employed to obtain the desired sufficient conditions. For the $\\rho$-convex\nproblem we obtain two sufficient optimality conditions to distinguish a global\nminimizer among the local minimizers, one with an underestimation of a\nLagrangian and the other with a different technique. A global sufficient\noptimality condition for the quadratic fractional problem is obtained by\nreformulating the problem as a quadratic problem and then utilizing the results\nof the quadratic problem. Examples are provided to illustrate the significance\nof the results obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 07:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-09"}

The logistic sigmoid however does not\nrepresent the true input-output relation in neuronal cells under physiological\nconditions. Here, bionodal root unit (BRU) activation functions are introduced,\nexhibiting input-output non-linearities that are substantially more\nbiologically plausible since their functional form is based on known\nbiophysical properties of neuronal cells.\n  In order to evaluate the learning performance of BRU activations, deep\nnetworks are constructed with identical architectures except differing in their\ntransfer functions (ReLU, ELU, and BRU). Multilayer perceptrons, stacked\nauto-encoders, and convolutional networks are used to test supervised and\nunsupervised learning based on the MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 datasets. Comparisons\nof learning performance, quantified using loss and error measurements,\ndemonstrate that bionodal networks both train faster than their ReLU and ELU\ncounterparts and result in the best generalised models even in the absence of\nformal regularisation. These results therefore suggest that revisiting the\ndetailed properties of biological neurones and their circuitry might prove\ninvaluable in the field of deep learning for the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 10:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 08:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}
