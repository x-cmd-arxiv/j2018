Existing specification approaches are\neither ambiguous or miss important aspects regarding the behavior of virtual\nnetwork functions (VNFs) forming a service. We propose to formally and\nunambiguously specify the behavior of these functions and services using\nQueuing Petri Nets (QPNs). QPNs are an established method that allows to\nexpress queuing, synchronization, stochastically distributed processing delays,\nand changing traffic volume and characteristics at each VNF. With QPNs,\nmultiple VNFs can be connected to complete network services in any structure,\neven specifying bidirectional network services containing loops.\n  We propose a tool-based workflow that supports the specification of network\nservices and the automatic generation of corresponding simulation code to\nenable an in-depth analysis of their behavior and performance. In a case study,\nwe show how developers can benefit from analysis insights, e.g., to anticipate\nthe impact of different service configurations. We also discuss how management\nand orchestration systems can benefit from our clear and comprehensive\nspecification approach and its extensive analysis possibilities, leading to\nbetter placement of VNFs and improved Quality of Service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 16:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 14:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Lasers provide longer\nlifetime and wider color gamut of light output. But the high degree of\ncoherence of these sources also lead to the formation of granular structures,\nusually known as speckle. When an imaging system is involved, as in the cinema\nprojection case because of the capacity of the human eye to form an image of\nthe screen, we speak about subjective speckle. In order to remove this spatial\nrandom pattern, different methods have been studied as temporal and/or spatial\ncoherence reduction. But most of them can't be used in the context of cinema\nprojection because they don't respect the cinematography projection standard.\nIn our work, we have studied the possibility to reduce the subjective speckle\neither by changing the coherence of the light source or by studying the\ninfluence of the different elements constituting the projection display in the\nconditions imposed by cinematography industry. Thanks to a lasers array formed\nby N independant semiconductor lasers, we have measured the evolution of the\nsubjective speckle contrast in function of the number of sources. The resulting\ncontrast discreases as a square root function and reach a saturation level when\na light pipe is used. This behavior is directly due to the light pipe which\nlimit at its output the spatial coherence of the source. Futhermore, in a\ndifferent configuration, we have studied the influence of diffusers and the\nmagnification of the projector zoom. It has been demonstrated that\nmagnification plays an important role on the speckle formation because it\nincreases the coherence length determined by the light pipe. On the contrary,\nthe diffusers placed before the light pipe doesn't change the subjective\nspeckle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 16:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

Koch (2017) introduced a notion of\nspatial risk measure and a corresponding set of axioms which are well suited to\nanalyze the risk due to events having a spatial extent, precisely such as\nenvironmental phenomena. The axiom of asymptotic spatial homogeneity is of\nparticular interest since it allows one to quantify the rate of spatial\ndiversification when the region under consideration becomes large. In this\npaper, we first investigate the general concepts of spatial risk measures and\ncorresponding axioms further and thoroughly explain the usefulness of this\ntheory for both actuarial science and practice. Second, in the case of a\ngeneral cost field, we give sufficient conditions such that spatial risk\nmeasures associated with expectation, variance, Value-at-Risk as well as\nexpected shortfall and induced by this cost field satisfy the axioms of\nasymptotic spatial homogeneity of order $0$, $-2$, $-1$ and $-1$, respectively.\nLast but not least, in the case where the cost field is a function of a\nmax-stable random field, we provide conditions on both the function and the\nmax-stable field ensuring the latter properties. Max-stable random fields are\nrelevant when assessing the risk of extreme events since they appear as a\nnatural extension of multivariate extreme-value theory to the level of random\nfields. Overall, this paper improves our understanding of spatial risk measures\nas well as of their properties with respect to the space variable and\ngeneralizes many results obtained in Koch (2017).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 17:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 09:20:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 17:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 08:24:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 13:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 13:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

While aggregate\nperformance has continued to improve, understanding individual causes of\nfailure has been difficult, as it is not always clear why a particular face\nfails to be recognized, or why an impostor is recognized by an algorithm.\nImportantly, other fields studying vision have addressed this via the use of\nvisual psychophysics: the controlled manipulation of stimuli and careful study\nof the responses they evoke in a model system. In this paper, we suggest that\nvisual psychophysics is a viable methodology for making face recognition\nalgorithms more explainable. A comprehensive set of procedures is developed for\nassessing face recognition algorithm behavior, which is then deployed over\nstate-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and more basic, yet still widely\nused, shallow and handcrafted feature-based approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 19:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

We denote\nthe resulting method p-DMRG (perturbative DMRG) to distinguish it from the\nstandard variational DMRG. p-DMRG is expected to be useful for systems with\nvery large active spaces, for which variational DMRG becomes too expensive.\nSimilar to SCI+PT, in p-DMRG a zeroth-order wavefunction is first obtained by a\nstandard DMRG calculation, but with a small bond dimension. Then, the residual\ncorrelation is recovered by a second-order perturbative treatment. We discuss\nthe choice of partitioning for the perturbation theory, which is crucial for\nits accuracy and robustness. To circumvent the problem of a large bond\ndimension in the first-order wavefunction, we use a sum of matrix product\nstates (MPS) to expand the first-order wavefunction, yielding substantial\nsavings in computational cost and memory.

Using the model enthalpy-based thermal evolution of\nloops (EBTEL), in this paper we numerically probe the production of EUV\nlate-phase solar flares. Starting from two main mechanisms of producing the EUV\nlate phase, i.e., long-lasting cooling and secondary heating, we carry out two\ngroups of numerical experiments to study the effects of these two processes on\nthe emission characteristics in late-phase loops. In either of the two\nprocesses an EUV late-phase solar flare that conforms to the observational\ncriteria can be numerically synthesized. However, the underlying hydrodynamic\nand thermodynamic evolutions in late-phase loops are different between the two\nsynthetic flare cases. The late-phase peak due to a long-lasting cooling\nprocess always occurs during the radiative cooling phase, while that powered by\na secondary heating is more likely to take place in the conductive cooling\nphase. We then propose a new method for diagnosing the two mechanisms based on\nthe shape of EUV late-phase light curves.

When equipping a statistical manifold with the KL\ndivergence, the induced manifold structure is dually flat, and the KL\ndivergence between distributions amounts to an equivalent Bregman divergence on\ntheir corresponding parameters. In practice, the corresponding Bregman\ngenerators of mixture/exponential families require to perform definite integral\ncalculus that can either be too time-consuming (for exponentially large\ndiscrete support case) or even do not admit closed-form formula (for continuous\nsupport case).

Using the continuous-time random walk in the presence of a bias, we\nprovide a novel mechanism for the enhancement of diffusion in a random energy\nlandscape. When the variance of the waiting time diverges, in contrast to the\nbias-free case the dynamics with bias becomes superdiffusive. In the\nsuperdiffusive regime, we find a distinct initial ensemble dependence of the\ndiffusivity. We show that the time-averaged variance converges to the\ncorresponding ensemble-averaged variance, i.e., ergodicity is preserved.\nHowever, trajectory-to-trajectory fluctuations of the time-averaged variance\ndecay slowly. Our finding suggests that in the superdiffusive regime the\ndiffusivity for a non-equilibrium initial ensemble gradually increases to that\nfor an equilibrium ensemble when the start of the measurement is delayed,\ncorresponding to a rejuvenation of diffusivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 03:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

If the system detects severe damage in\nthe slides, it could notify the experts that manual microscope reading may be\nrequired.

Specifically, the first step of our framework is to perform dense\nfine-grained region classification on the whole slide and calculate the region\ndistribution histogram. Next, our framework will generate assessments of the\nslide quality from various perspectives: staining quality, information density,\ndamage level and which regions are more valuable for subsequent\nhigh-magnification analysis. To make the information more accessible, we\npresent our results in the form of a heat map and text summaries.

However, there is a noticeable\ndearth of literature focusing on objective comparisons between these methods,\nespecially when they are coupled to the momentum equation and applied in\nphysically relevant regimes. In this article, we compare two techniques for\nsimulating two-phase flows that possess attractive qualities, but belong to the\ntwo distinct classes of diffuse interface (DI) and volume of fluid (VOF)\nmethods. Both of these methods allow for mass-conserving schemes that can\nnaturally capture large interfacial topology changes omnipresent in realistic\ntwo phase flows. The DI solver used in this work is based on a conservative and\nbounded phase field method, developed recently. Similar to level set methods,\nthis diffuse interface method takes advantage of the smoothness of the phase\nfield in computing curvature and surface tension forces. Geometric VOF methods\ntrack the fractional tagged volume in a cell. The specific geometric VOF scheme\nused here is a discretely conservative and bounded implementation that uses\ngeometric algorithms for unsplit advection and interface reconstruction, while\nemploying height functions for normal and curvature calculation. We present a\nquantitative comparison of these methods on Cartesian meshes in terms of their\naccuracy, convergence rate, and computational cost using canonical\ntwo-dimensional (2D) two-phase test cases: a very dense drop moving through a\nquiescent gas, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, an equilibrium static drop, an\noscillating drop and the damped surface wave.

Among these, one of the most commonly used\nis the Gas Electron Multiplier. Commonly deployed as fast timing detectors and\ntriggers, due to their fast response, high rate capability and high radiation\nhardness, they can also be used as trackers. The center of gravity readout\ntechnique allows to overcome the limit of the digital pads, whose spatial\nresolution is constrained by the pitch size. The presence of a high external\nmagnetic field can distort the electronic cloud and affect the spatial\nresolution. The micro-TPC reconstruction method allows to reconstruct the three\ndimensional particle position as in a traditional Time Projection Chamber, but\nwithin a drift gap of a few millimeters.

This is one of the first implementations of this\ntechnique for GEM detectors in magnetic field and allows to reach unprecedented\nperformance for gas detectors, up to a limit of 120 micron at 1T, one of the\nworld's best results for MPGDs in strong magnetic field.

In this paper, we\npropose a dynamic memory network to adapt the template to the target's\nappearance variations during tracking. An LSTM is used as a memory controller,\nwhere the input is the search feature map and the outputs are the control\nsignals for the reading and writing process of the memory block. As the\nlocation of the target is at first unknown in the search feature map, an\nattention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential\ntarget. To prevent aggressive model adaptivity, we apply gated residual\ntemplate learning to control the amount of retrieved memory that is used to\ncombine with the initial template. Unlike tracking-by-detection methods where\nthe object's information is maintained by the weight parameters of neural\nnetworks, which requires expensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our\ntracker runs completely feed-forward and adapts to the target's appearance\nchanges by updating the external memory. Moreover, unlike other tracking\nmethods where the model capacity is fixed after offline training --- the\ncapacity of our tracker can be easily enlarged as the memory requirements of a\ntask increase, which is favorable for memorizing long-term object information.\nExtensive experiments on OTB and VOT demonstrates that our tracker MemTrack\nperforms favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods while retaining\nreal-time speed of 50 fps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 06:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 05:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Here, for the\nfirst time, we observe the formation of REPs in a single crystal CsPbBr3\nperovskite cavity without any external fields. These polaritons exhibit strong\nnonlinear behavior that leads to a coherent polariton condensate with a\nprominent blue shift. Furthermore, the REPs in CsPbBr3 are highly anisotropic\nand have a large extinction ratio, arising from the perovskite's orthorhombic\ncrystal structure. Our observation not only sheds light on the importance of\nmany-body physics in coherent polariton systems involving higher-order excited\nstates, but also paves the way for exploring these coherent interactions for\nsolid state quantum optical information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 07:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 22:12:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 05:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

The simulations attempt to assess the variation of\nflow dynamics caused by a change in the characteristic size of the V-groove\nriblets. Such characterization of size effects provides a means to identify the\nlocal flow features arising from fluid-riblet interaction, and to investigate\ntheir relevance to the change in viscous drag and turbulence statistics. The\npresent simulations confirmed an improved variation trend when the flow\ndynamics is examined in the light of the groove size. At the lower end of the\nrange of groove size considered, the profiles of turbulence statistics more or\nless resemble the plane channel flow, except for a systematic shift with the\ngroove size. When the groove size becomes increasingly large, the lodging of\nnear-wall flow structures and the generation of mean secondary flows tend to be\nmore apparent. The collective impact of the lodging of flow structures and the\nmean secondary flow correlates with the increase in viscous drag, and leads to\nsignificant alterations of the turbulence statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 08:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

Historically, time, frequency and\nmore recently, spatial dimensions have been used to improve capacity and\nrobustness. Paradoxically, radiocommunications that leverage the polarization\ndimension have not evolved at the same pace. In particular, these\ncommunications are widely used by satellites, where several streams are\nmultiplexed in each orthogonal polarization. Current communication trends\nadvocate for simplifying and unifying different frameworks in order to increase\nflexibility and address future needs. Due to this, systems that do not require\nchannel information are progressively gaining traction. This dissertation aims\nat challenging this perspective and promoting the use of polarization in new\nradiocommunication systems. Consequently, the goal of this thesis is twofold:\nfirst, we aim at increasing the current capacity of point-to-point and\npoint-to-multipoint links. Secondly, we introduce new mechanisms to increase\nthe robustness of communications in particularly hostile environments. In this\ncontext, this thesis advocates for the use of polarization as a dimension to be\nexploited in radiocommunications. In addition to the use of polarization, index\nmodulations help increase transmission rates whilst improving robustness\nagainst errors and imperfections with a low computational complexity. Thus, the\nstudy of polarization in these systems is essential. This dissertation explores\nprimordial aspects in this area, such as channel capacity, transmitter and\nreceiver design and performance benchmarking with current systems. Finally, we\nidentify and discuss various characteristic aspects of polarization. In this\nthesis, the reader will navigate the mathematical foundations of the proposed\nconcepts as well as their implementation in real-life scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 08:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

However,\nchallenges are posed by high variability and complexity of structural features\nin such images, in addition to imaging artifacts. Further, the conventional\napproach of manual thresholding is labor-intensive, and highly sensitive to\ninter- and intra-image intensity variations. An accurate and robust automated\nsegmentation method is of high interest. We propose and evaluate an elegant\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) designed for segmentation of histological\nimages, particularly those with Masson's trichrome stain. The network comprises\nof 11 successive convolutional - rectified linear unit - batch normalization\nlayers, and outperformed state-of-the-art CNNs on a dataset of cardiac\nhistological images (labeling fibrosis, myocytes, and background) with a Dice\nsimilarity coefficient of 0.947. With 100 times fewer (only 300 thousand)\ntrainable parameters, our CNN is less susceptible to overfitting, and is\nefficient. Additionally, it retains image resolution from input to output,\ncaptures fine-grained details, and can be trained end-to-end smoothly. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first deep CNN tailored for the problem of\nconcern, and may be extended to solve similar segmentation tasks to facilitate\ninvestigations into pathology and clinical treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 08:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

The beamformer that maximizes the minimum\nharvested energy among all ERs in the selected cluster is found by solving a\nconvex optimization problem.

Understanding this phenomenon may\nprovide important explanations for similar highly curved microtubules which can\nbe found in nerve cells undergoing neurodegeneration.

However, the importance of each of\nthese factors and how they interact remains a matter of debate. Here, we\ndisentangle these factors by analysing their influence over time. For this\npurpose we develop a saliency model which is based on the internal\nrepresentation of a recent early spatial vision model to measure the low-level\nbottom-up factor. To measure the influence of high-level bottom-up features, we\nuse a recent DNN-based saliency model. To account for top-down influences, we\nevaluate the models on two large datasets with different tasks: first, a\nmemorisation task and, second, a search task. Our results lend support to a\nseparation of visual scene exploration into three phases: The first saccade, an\ninitial guided exploration characterised by a gradual broadening of the\nfixation density, and an steady state which is reached after roughly 10\nfixations. Saccade target selection during the initial exploration and in the\nsteady state are related to similar areas of interest, which are better\npredicted when including high-level features. In the search dataset, fixation\nlocations are determined predominantly by top-down processes. In contrast, the\nfirst fixation follows a different fixation density and contains a strong\ncentral fixation bias. Nonetheless, first fixations are guided strongly by\nimage properties and as early as 200 ms after image onset, fixations are better\npredicted by high-level information. We conclude that any low-level bottom-up\nfactors are mainly limited to the generation of the first saccade.

For this reason, identification in dynamic\nnetworks often focuses in obtaining consistent estimates of particular network\nmodules of interest.

In addition to its methodological advantages, this approach allows us\nto study several issues of broad current interest like the build up in time of\nKondo correlations and the presence or absence of bistability associated with\nelectron-phonon interactions. We find that, in general, correlation effects\ntend to remove the possible appearance of charge bistability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 11:20:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 16:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

By adopting a strategy of\nultra-long exposure times, from 20 to 80 hours per source, VANDELS is designed\nto be the deepest ever spectroscopic survey of the high-redshift Universe.\nExploiting the red sensitivity of the VIMOS spectrograph, the survey has\nobtained ultra-deep spectra covering the wavelength 4800-10000 A with\nsufficient signal-to-noise to investigate the astrophysics of high-redshift\ngalaxy evolution via detailed absorption line studies. The VANDELS-DR1 is the\nrelease of all spectra obtained during the first season of observations and\nincludes data for galaxies for which the total (or half of the total) scheduled\nintegration time was completed. The release contains 879 individual objects\nwith a measured redshift and includes fully wavelength and flux-calibrated 1D\nspectra, the associated error spectra, sky spectra and wavelength-calibrated 2D\nspectra. We also provide a catalog with the essential galaxy parameters,\nincluding spectroscopic redshifts and redshift quality flags. In this paper we\npresent the survey layout and observations, the data reduction and redshift\nmeasurement procedure and the general properties of the VANDELS-DR1 sample. We\nalso discuss the spectroscopic redshift distribution, the accuracy of the\nphotometric redshifts and we provide some examples of data products.

For all molecules we observe at least two distinct groups of\nconductance plateaus. By a careful analysis of the length behavior of these\nplateaus, comparing the behavior across the different cores and with methyl\nsulfide anchor groups, we demonstrate that the lower conductance groups\ncorrespond to the incorporation of Au(RS)2 oligomeric units at the contacts.\nThese structural motifs are found on the surface of gold nanoparticles but they\nhave not before been shown to exist in molecular-break junctions. The results,\nwhile exemplifying the complex nature of thiol chemistry on gold, moreover\nclarify the conductance of 1,4-benzenedithiol on gold.

In this respect, the BRITE constellation is\nparticularly interesting as it provides space-based multi-colour photometry.\nThe present contribution describes the latest developments in obtaining\ntheoretical predictions for amplitude ratios and phase differences for\npulsation modes in rapidly rotating stars. These developments are based on full\n2D non-adiabatic pulsation calculations, using models from the ESTER code, the\nonly code to treat in a self-consistent way the thermal equilibrium of rapidly\nrotating stars. These predictions are then specifically applied to the BRITE\nphotometric bands to explore the prospects of identifying modes based on BRITE\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 14:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

We theoretically investigate motility control at the cellular\nscale, using cilia and flagella as ideal model system. Cilia and flagella are\nhighly conserved slender cell appendages that exhibit spontaneous bending\nwaves. This flagellar beat represents a prime example of a chemo-mechanical\noscillator, which is driven by the collective dynamics of molecular motors\ninside the flagellar axoneme. We study the nonlinear dynamics of flagellar\nswimming, steering, and synchronization, which encompasses shape control of the\nflagellar beat by chemical signals and mechanical forces. Mechanical forces can\nsynchronize collections of flagella to beat at a common frequency, despite\nactive motor noise that tends to randomize flagellar synchrony. In Chapter 2,\nwe present a new physical mechanism for flagellar synchronization by mechanical\nself-stabilization that applies to free-swimming flagellated cells. This new\nmechanism is independent of direct hydrodynamic interactions between flagella.\nComparison with experimental data provided by experimental collaboration\npartners in the laboratory of J.

The long-term stability of this configuration is confirmed, but\nthe motion of planets is found to be chaotic. The eccentricity values are found\nto vary within finite ranges. The rates of tidal dissipation and tidal\nevolution of orbits are estimated, assuming an Earth-like rheology for the\nplanets. We find that under this assumption the planets b, d, e were captured\nin the 3:2 or higher spin-orbit resonances during the initial spin-down but\nslipped further down into the 1:1 resonance. Dependent on its rheology, the\ninnermost planet b may be captured in a stable pseudosynchronous rotation.\nNon-synchronous rotation ensures higher levels of tidal dissipation and\ninternal heating. The positive feedback between the viscosity and the\ndissipation rate -- and the ensuing runaway heating -- are terminated by a few\nself-regulation processes. When the temperature is high and the viscosity is\nlow enough, the planet spontaneously leaves the 3:2 resonance. Further heating\nis stopped either by passing the peak dissipation or by the emergence of\npartial melt in the mantle. In the post-solidus state, the tidal dissipation is\nlimited to the levels supported by the heat transfer efficiency. The tides on\nthe host star are unlikely to have had a significant dynamical impact. The\ntides on the synchronized inner planets tend to reduce these planets' orbital\neccentricity, possibly contributing thereby to the system's stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 14:32:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 12:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

To make advances in the direction, first of all, one should consider\nfractals as states of dynamics. In other words, instead of single points and\nfinite/infinite dimensional vectors, fractals should be points of trajectories\nas well as trajectories themselves.

This diffusive process is driven by the difference\nbetween the gas concentration near the bubble, whose value is governed by the\ninternal pressure through Henry's law, and the concentration in the far field.\nThe presence of neighbouring bubbles can significantly slow down this process\nby increasing the effective background concentration and reducing the diffusing\nflux of dissolved gas experienced by each bubble. We develop theoretical\nmodelling of such diffusive shielding process in the case of small microbubbles\nwhose internal pressure is dominated by Laplace pressure. We first use an exact\nsemi-analytical solution to capture the case of two bubbles, analyse in detail\nthe shielding effect and show that hydrodynamic effects are mostly negligible\nexcept in the case of almost-touching bubbles.

In this paper, we propose a novel video\nrain streak removal approach FastDeRain, which fully considers the\ndiscriminative characteristics of rain streaks and the clean video in the\ngradient domain. Specifically, on the one hand, rain streaks are sparse and\nsmooth along the direction of the raindrops, whereas on the other hand, clean\nvideos exhibit piecewise smoothness along the rain-perpendicular direction and\ncontinuity along the temporal direction. Theses smoothness and continuity\nresults in the sparse distribution in the different directional gradient\ndomain, respectively. Thus, we minimize 1) the $\\ell_1$ norm to enhance the\nsparsity of the underlying rain streaks, 2) two $\\ell_1$ norm of unidirectional\nTotal Variation (TV) regularizers to guarantee the anisotropic spatial\nsmoothness, and 3) an $\\ell_1$ norm of the time-directional difference operator\nto characterize the temporal continuity. A split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage\nalgorithm (SALSA) based algorithm is designed to solve the proposed\nminimization model. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real data\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

This paper aims to quantify the benefits of selling devices and\ncomplementary services under the following three strategies: separate pricing,\nbundled pricing, and hybrid pricing (both the separate and bundled options are\noffered). A comprehensive comparison of the above three strategies is carried\nout for two popular service models, namely physical connectivity sharing and\nvirtual content sharing, respectively. We first study the physical service\nmodel where the provider (e.g., FON) offers users customized WiFi devices for\nindoor Internet access, and allows service subscribers to physically access all\ndevice owners' WiFi when traveling. Observing that all device-owners contribute\nto the connectivity sharing, we show, via a Stackelberg game theoretic\napproach, that bundled pricing outperforms separate pricing as long as the\ntotal cost of device and service is reasonably low to stimulate network\nexternality. Further, hybrid pricing strictly dominates bundled pricing thanks\nto the pricing flexibility to keep high marginal profit of device-selling.\nNext, we investigate the virtual sharing service model where the provider\n(e.g., Apple) sells devices and device-supported applications. Different from\nthe connectivity service model, in this model service subscribers directly\ncontribute to the virtual content sharing, and the network externality can be\nfairly strong. We prove that hybrid pricing degenerates to bundled pricing if\nthe network externality degree is larger than the average device valuation,\nwhich is in stark contrast with the connectivity service model in which hybrid\npricing always outperforms bundled pricing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 15:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

Non-linear extraction strategies such as Synchronous Electrical\nCharge Extraction (SECE) [1-2], energy investing [3] or Synchronized Switch\nHarvesting on Inductor (SSHI) [4] have been developed to maximize the extracted\nenergy from harmonic excitations. However, in most of today's applications,\nvibrations are not periodic and mechanical shocks occur at unpredictable rates\n[4]. SSHI interfaces naturally seemed to be the most appropriate candidate for\nharvesting shocks as they exhibit outstanding performance in periodic\nexcitations [4]. However, the SSHI strategy presents inherent weaknesses while\nharvesting shocks, since the invested energy stored in the piezoelectric\ncapacitance cannot be recovered. In this work, we propose a self-starting,\nbattery-less, 0.55mm 2 integrated energy harvesting interface based on SECE\nstrategy which has been optimized to work under shock stimulus. Due to the\nsporadic nature of mechanical shocks which imply long periods of inactivity and\nbrief energy peaks, the interface's average consumption is optimized by\nminimizing the quiescent power. A dedicated energy saving sequencing has thus\nbeen designed, reducing the static current to 30nA and enabling energy to be\nextracted with only one single 8$\\mu$J shock occurring every 100s. Our\nSECE-based circuit features a shock FoM 1.6x greater than previous SSHI-based\ninterfaces [4].

The sequencing is divided in 4 phases and\nthe associated time diagrams are illustrated in Fig.2. During the sleeping mode\nT1, all blocks except the shock detection (SD) are turned off. During the\nstarting phase, the energy is stored in CASIC through a cold-start path,\nincreasing VASIC. This will progressively turn on the SD.

The systems way of thinking has already\nenabled scientists to gain considerable headway in framing global environmental\nchallenges. On the other hand, technical solutions to environmental problems\nhave begun to show significant promise, driven by the advent of technology and\nits increased proliferation in coupled human and natural systems. Such settings\nlie on the interface of engineering, social and environmental sciences, and as\nsuch, require a common language in order for natural resources to be studied,\nmanaged and ultimately sustained. In this dissertation, we argue that the\nsystems theoretic tradition of cybernetics may provide the necessary common\nground for examining such systems.\n  After discussing the relevance of the cybernetic approach to natural resource\ngovernance, we present a mathematical model of resource consumption, grounded\nin social psychological research on consumer behavior. We also provide\ninterpretations of the model at various levels of abstraction in the social\nnetwork of the consuming population. We demonstrate the potential of the model\nby examining it in various theoretic frameworks which include dynamical\nsystems, optimal control theory, game theory and the theory of learning in\ngames. Each framework yields different policy guidelines to avoid Tragedy of\nthe Commons like scenarios in the natural resource system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 07:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

This paper is one of a series that\naims to test and develop the new Action Principle. We study a model of rotating\nplanets, a compressible fluid in a stationary state of motion, under the\ninfluence of a fixed or mutual gravitational field. The main problem is to\naccount for the shape and the velocity fields, given the size of the equatorial\nbulges, the angular velocity at equator and the density profiles. The theory is\napplied to the principal objects in the solar system, from Earth and Mars to\nSaturn with fine details of its hexagonal flow and to Haumea with its odd\nshape. With only 2 parameters the model gives a fair fit to the shapes and the\nangular velocity field near the surface. Planetary rings are an unforeseen, but\na natural and inevitable feature of the dynamics; no cataclysmic event need be\ninvoked to justify them. The simple solutions that have been studied so far are\nmost suitable for the hard planets, and for them the predicted density profiles\nare reasonable. The effect of precession was not taken into account, nor were\nentropic forces, so far. There has not yet been a systematic search for truly\nrealistic solutions. The intention is to test the versatility of the action\nprinciple; the indications are are very encouraging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 04:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

The analysis is repeated in many\ntextbooks and reviews up to 2017, and its failure to agree with observation was\nduly noted. More successful approaches have been found, but little was done to\ndiscover the weak point of Rayleigh's argument, what is the reason that it\nfails. This paper identifies the mistake as one that is endemic in the\nliterature. Since the physics of the problem remains poorly understood, a\ndiscussion of this paradox should prove useful. Briefly, the argument depends\non the Navier-Stokes equation and on the assumption that a certain expression\ncalled \"energy density\" or \"kinetic potential\" can be interpreted and used as\nsuch. It is shown here that %no energy density is compatible with the\nNavier-Stokes equation, in the context of Couette flow or in general, and that\nthe use of any expression as a kinetic potential is in conflict with the\nNavier-Stokes equation, in all but a very limited context.\n  An alternative analysis of basic Couette flow, based on an action principle\nfor compressible fluids, provides a Hamiltonian density as well as a kinetic\npotential. The two are not the same, even in the simplest cases. The action\nprinciple provides a kinetic potential; a new criterion for stability\nrecognizes the profound effect of the surface adhesion and the tensile strength\nof water.
