In this case,\ndetailed knowledge of the polymorphic energy landscape for an active\npharmaceutical ingredient yields profound insight regarding the existence and\nlikelihood of late-appearing polymorphs. However, the computational prediction\nof the structures and stabilities of molecular crystal polymorphs is\nparticularly challenging due to the high dimensionality of conformational and\ncrystallographic space accompanied by the need for relative (free) energies to\nwithin $\\approx$ 1 kJ/mol per molecule. In this work, we combine the most\nsuccessful crystal structure sampling strategy with the most accurate energy\nranking strategy of the latest blind test of organic crystal structure\nprediction (CSP), organized by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre\n(CCDC). Our final energy ranking is based on first-principles density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations that include three key physical\ncontributions: (i) a sophisticated treatment of Pauli exchange-repulsion and\nelectron correlation effects with hybrid functionals, (ii) inclusion of\nmany-body van der Waals dispersion interactions, and (iii) account of\nvibrational free energies. In doing so, this combined approach has an optimal\nsuccess rate in producing the crystal structures corresponding to the five\nblind-test molecules. With this practical approach, we demonstrate the\nfeasibility of obtaining reliable structures and stabilities for molecular\ncrystals of pharmaceutical importance, paving the way towards an enhanced\nfundamental understanding of polymorphic energy landscapes and routine\nindustrial application of molecular CSP methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Its migration, especially for developing economies such as\nChina, plays a strong role in the reallocation of productive resources and\noffers a promising proxy for understanding socio-economic issues. Nevertheless,\ndue to long cycle, expensive cost and coarse granularity, conventional surveys\nface challenges in comprehensively profiling it. With the permeation of smart\nand mobile devices in recent decades, booming social media has essentially\nbroken spatio-temporal constraints and enabled the continuous sensing of the\nreal-time mobility of massive numbers of individuals. In this study, we\ndemonstrate that similar to a natural shock, the Spring Festival culturally\ndrives workforce travel between workplaces and hometowns, and the trajectory\nfootprints from social media therefore open a window with unparalleled richness\nand fine granularity to explore laws in national-level workforce migration. To\nunderstand the core driving forces of workforce migration flux between cities\nin China, various indicators reflecting the benefits and costs of migration are\nintroduced into our prediction model. We find that urban GDP (gross domestic\nproduct) and travel time are two excellent indicators to help make predictions.\nDiverse migration patterns are then revealed by clustering the trajectories,\nwhich give important clues to help understand the different roles of Chinese\ncities in their own development and in regional economic development. These\npatterns are further explained as a joint effect of the subjective will to seek\npersonal benefits and the capacity requirements of local labour markets. Our\nstudy implies that the non-negligible entanglement between social media and\nmacroeconomic behaviours can be insightful for policymaking in social-economic\nissues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:21:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 02:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

This signal has been interpreted as\nthe absorption of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons at redshifts $15\n\\lesssim z \\lesssim 20$ by the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen,\nwhose temperature is expected to be coupled to the gas temperature by the\nWouthuysen-Field effect during this epoch. Because the gas is colder than the\nCMB, the 21cm signal is seen in absorption. However, the absorption depth\nreported by EDGES is more than twice the maximal value expected in the standard\ncosmological model, at $\\approx 3.8\\sigma$ significance. Here, we propose an\nexplanation for this depth based on \"early dark energy\" (EDE), a scenario in\nwhich an additional component with equation of state $w=-1$ contributes to the\ncosmological energy density at early times, before decaying rapidly at a\ncritical redshift, $z_c$. For $20 \\lesssim z_c \\lesssim 1000$, the accelerated\nexpansion due to the EDE can produce an earlier decoupling of the gas\ntemperature from the radiation temperature than that in the standard model,\ngiving the gas additional time to cool adiabatically before the first luminous\nsources form. We show that the EDE scenario can successfully explain the large\namplitude of the EDGES signal. However, such models are strongly ruled out by\nobservations of the CMB temperature power spectrum. Moreover, the EDE models\nneeded to explain the EDGES signal exacerbate the current tension in low- and\nhigh-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant.

The existence of this error is independent\nof the numerical radiation transfer (RT) method (even in exact\nray-tracing/Monte-Carlo methods), because it depends on how the RT solution is\ninterpolated back onto fluid elements.

With 548 AGN in the redshift range 0.01<z<0.1 over the full sky from\nthe DR1 catalog, BASS provides the largest, least biased sample of local AGN to\ndate due to its hard X-ray selection (14-195 keV) and rich\nmultiwavelength/ancillary data. By measuring the projected cross-correlation\nfunction between the AGN and 2MASS galaxies, and interpreting it via halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) and subhalo-based models, we constrain the\noccupation statistics of the full sample, as well as in bins of absorbing\ncolumn density and black hole mass. We find that AGN tend to reside in galaxy\ngroup environments, in agreement with previous studies of AGN throughout a\nlarge range of luminosity and redshift, and that on average they occupy their\ndark matter halos similar to inactive galaxies of comparable stellar mass. We\nalso find evidence that obscured AGN tend to reside in denser environments than\nunobscured AGN, even when samples were matched in luminosity, redshift, stellar\nmass, and Eddington ratio. We show that this can be explained either by\nsignificantly different halo occupation distributions or statistically\ndifferent host halo assembly histories. Lastly, we see that massive black holes\nare slightly more likely to reside in central galaxies than black holes of\nsmaller mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 18:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 21:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 17:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

For\nexperimental analysis, sunflower oil is used as the carrier phase and DI water\nas the dispersed phase which is intermixed with Triton X-100 that acts as the\nsurfactant. A T-junction is used in the microchannel for the purpose of droplet\ngeneration. Presence of an imposed pressure driven flow induces droplet\ndeformation and disturbs the equilibrium that results in subsequent\nsurfactant-redistribution along the interface. This further induces a gradient\nin the surface tension, thus generating a Marangoni stress that significantly\nalters the droplet dynamics. On subsequent experimental investigation, it is\nfound that presence of surfactants reduces the cross-stream migration velocity\nof the droplet. Further, it is shown that the effect of surfactants in reducing\nthe cross-stream migration is significantly enhanced for a larger droplet as\ncompared to a smaller one within the same time span, provided the channel\nheight is kept constant. In addition, a larger surfactant concentration is\nfound to induce a greater retardation in cross-stream migration of the droplet,\nthe effect of which is reduced when the initial transverse position of the\ndroplet is shifted closer to the channel centerline. The present analysis can\nbe applied to various droplet based microfluidic as well as medical diagnostic\ndevices where manipulation of droplet trajectory is a major issue. For the\ntheoretical counterpart, an asymptotic approach is adopted in the presence of\nbulk-insoluble surfactants and under the assumption of negligible fluid\ninertia.

The\nproduction of PBHs requires a large amplification in the power spectrum of\ncurvature perturbations between scales associated with CMB and PBH formation.\nIn principle, this can be achieved by temporarily breaking the slow-roll\nconditions during inflation. In this work, we identify two string setups that\ncan realise this process. In string axion models of inflation, subleading\nnon-perturbative effects can superimpose steep cliffs and gentle plateaus onto\nthe leading axion potential. The cliffs can momentarily violate the slow-roll\nconditions, and the plateaus can lead to phases of ultra slow-roll inflation.\nWe thus achieve a string motivated model which both matches the Planck\nobservations at CMB scales and produces a population of light PBHs, which can\naccount for an order one fraction of dark matter. In DBI models of inflation, a\nsharp increase in the speed of sound sourced by a steep downward step in the\nwarp factor can drive the amplification. In this scenario, discovery of PBHs\ncould indicate non-trivial dynamics in the bulk, such as flux-antibrane\nannihilation at the tip of a warped throat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 19:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 22:35:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Uncertainties include the instrument\ndetector band, which could systematically change across the focal plane, as\nwell as the calibration of the instrument used to measure the bands. A\npotentially major effect is time-dependent gain and band uncertainties caused\nby atmospheric fluctuations. More specifically, changes in atmospheric\nconditions lead to frequency-dependent changes in the atmospheric transmission\nwhich, in turn, leads to variations in the effective gain and central frequency\nof the instrument's bandpass. Using atmospheric modeling software and ACTPol\nbandpasses, we simulate the expected variations in band gain and central\nfrequency for 20, 40, 90, 150, and 240 GHz bands as a function of precipitable\nwater vapor, observing angle, and ground temperature.

To exploit the merits of distributed computation algorithms, the\nstabilizing terminal controller, value function and invariant terminal set of\nthe DMPC optimization problem need to respect the loosely coupled structure of\nthe system. Although existing methods in the literature address this task, they\ntypically decouple the synthesis of terminal controllers and value functions\nfrom the one of terminal sets.

We\nreport here on a new simplification that arises in the effective tidal\ndeformability of the binary, when the chirp mass is specified. We find that, in\nthis case, the effective tidal deformability of the binary is surprisingly\nindependent of the component masses of the individual neutron stars, and\ninstead depends primarily on the ratio of the chirp mass to the neutron star\nradius. Thus, a measurement of the effective tidal deformability can be used to\ndirectly measure the neutron star radius.

They provide critical information regarding the state of volcanic\nunrest, and their occurrence rates are key data for eruption forecasting. LPs\nare commonly quasi-periodic or 'anti-clustered', unlike volcano-tectonic (VT)\nearthquakes, so the existing Poisson point process methods used to model\noccurrence rates of VT earthquakes are unlikely to be optimal for LP data. We\nevaluate the performance of candidate formulations for LP data, based on\ninhomogeneous point process models with four different inter-event time\ndistributions: exponential (IP), Gamma (IG), inverse Gaussian (IIG), and\nWeibull (IW). We examine how well these models explain the observed data, and\nthe quality of retrospective forecasts of eruption time. We use a Bayesian MCMC\napproach to fit the models. Goodness-of-fit is assessed using Quantile-Quantile\nand Kolmogorov-Smirnov methods, and benchmarking against results obtained from\nsynthetic datasets.

Retrospective\nforecasting analysis shows that the IG model performs best, with the initial\npreference for the IIG model controlled by catalogue incompleteness late in the\nsequence. The IG model fits the data significantly better than the IP model,\nand simulations show it produces better forecasts for highly periodic data.\nSimulations also show that forecast precision increases with the degree of\nperiodicity of the earthquake process using the IG model, and so should be\nbetter for LP earthquakes than VTs.

In this work, an R package, SurvBoost, is developed\nto implement the gradient boosting algorithm for fitting the SPH model with\nhigh-dimensional covariate variables and other confounders. Extensive\nsimulation studies demonstrate that in many scenarios SurvBoost can achieve a\nbetter selection accuracy and reduce computational time substantially compared\nto the existing R package that implements boosting algorithms without\nstratification. The proposed R package is also illustrated by an analysis of\nthe gene expression data with survival outcome in The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA) study. In addition, a detailed hands-on tutorial for SurvBoost is\nprovided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 01:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

Such theories have been used to cast doubt on the\nhabitability of ocean worlds. However, Levi et al (2017) have recently proposed\na mechanism by which CO2 is mobilized between the atmosphere and the interior\nof an ocean world. At high enough CO2 pressures, sea ice can become enriched in\nCO2 clathrates and sink after a threshold density is achieved. The presence of\nsubpolar sea ice is of great importance for habitability in ocean worlds. It\nmay moderate the climate and is fundamental in current theories of life\nformation in diluted environments.

This paper proposes a novel context-assisted single\nshot face detector, named \\emph{PyramidBox} to handle the hard face detection\nproblem. Observing the importance of the context, we improve the utilization of\ncontextual information in the following three aspects. First, we design a novel\ncontext anchor to supervise high-level contextual feature learning by a\nsemi-supervised method, which we call it PyramidAnchors. Second, we propose the\nLow-level Feature Pyramid Network to combine adequate high-level context\nsemantic feature and Low-level facial feature together, which also allows the\nPyramidBox to predict faces of all scales in a single shot. Third, we introduce\na context-sensitive structure to increase the capacity of prediction network to\nimprove the final accuracy of output. In addition, we use the method of\nData-anchor-sampling to augment the training samples across different scales,\nwhich increases the diversity of training data for smaller faces.

We characterize the properties of this estimator\nunder high-dimensional scaling, where the growth rate of the system dimension\nis comparable to or even faster than that of the number of available sample\ntrajectories. In particular, using contemporary results on high-dimensional\nstatistics, we show that the proposed estimator results in a small element-wise\nerror, provided that the number of sample trajectories is above a threshold.\nThis threshold depends polynomially on the size of each block and the number of\nnonzero elements at different rows of input and state matrices, but only\nlogarithmically on the system dimension.

The period of\nthese torsional oscillations and their latitudinal propagation roughly\ncoincides with the period and equatorward propagation of sunspots which\noriginate from a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism operating in the Suns\ninterior. While the solar differential rotation plays an important role in this\ndynamo mechanism by inducting the toroidal component of magnetic field, the\nimpact of torsional oscillations on the dynamo mechanism and hence the solar\ncycle is not well understood. Here, we include the observed torsional\noscillations into a flux transport dynamo model of the solar cycle to\ninvestigate their effect. We find that the overall amplitude of the solar cycle\ndoes not change significantly on inclusion of torsional oscillations. However,\nall the characteristics of the Waldmeier effect in the sunspot cycle are\nqualitatively reproduced by varying only the amplitude of torsional\noscillations. The Waldmeier effect, first noted in 1935, includes the important\ncharacteristic that the amplitude of sunspot cycles is anti-correlated to their\nrise time; cycles with high initial rise rate tend to be stronger. This has\nimplications for solar cycle predictions. Our results suggest that the\nWaldmeier effect could be a plausible outcome of cycle to cycle modulation of\ntorsional oscillations and provides a physical basis for sunspot cycle\nforecasts based on torsional oscillation observations. We also provide a\ntheoretical explanation based on the magnetic induction equation thereby\nconnecting two apparently disparate phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 06:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

To authenticate, the user follows the paths of three\nshapes as they move, one on each frame, over three consecutive frames.\n  The system uses either the template matching or decision tree algorithms to\nmatch the scan-path of the user's gaze with the path traversed by the shape.\nThe system was evaluated with seven users to test the accuracy of both the\nalgorithms. We found that with the template matching algorithm the system\nachieves an accuracy of 95%, and with the decision tree algorithm an accuracy\nof 90.2%. We also present the advantages and disadvantages of using both the\nalgorithms. Our study suggests that gaze-based authentication is a highly\nsecure method against shoulder-surfing attacks as the unique pattern of eye\nmovements for each individual makes the system hard to break into.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 07:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

The\ncontribution to the grand thermodynamic potential associated with mesoscopic\nfluctuations is explicitly taken into account. The expression for this\ncontribution is obtained by the methods known from the Brazovskii field theory.\nApart from developing the approximate expression for the grand thermodynamic\npotential that contains the fluctuation contribution and is ready for numerical\nminimization, we develop a simplified version of the theory valid for weakly\nordered phases, i.e. for the high -T part of the phase diagram. The simplified\ntheory is verified by a comparison with the results of simulations for a\nparticular version of the short-range attraction long-range repulsion (SALR)\ninteraction potential. Except from the fact that in our theory the ordered\nphases are stable at lower T than in simulations, a good agreement for the\nhigh-T part of the phase diagram is obtained for the range of density that was\nconsidered in simulations. In addition, the equation of state and\ncompressibility isotherms are presented. Finally, the physical interpretation\nof the fluctuation-contribution to the grand potential is discussed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 08:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2018 17:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) structure applies\nthe Fire module of SqueezeNet, and the fewer parameters used require only 2.0\nMB of memory. The network that has completed training is applied to the\ntraining data in a fully convolutional way, and the optimal threshold to\ndistinguish fake fingerprints is determined, which is used in the final test.\nAs a result of this study experiment, the proposed method showed an average\nclassification error of 1.35%, demonstrating a fake fingerprint detection\nmethod using a high-performance CNN with a small number of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 09:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

The Seebeck coefficient generated based on hybrid functionals were\nfound to agree better than GGA with experimental data for GaAs, InP, and PbTe.\nFor PbTe, even the choice of hybrid functional has bearing on the\ninterpretation of experimental data, which we attribute to the description of\nvalley convergence of the valence band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 11:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

This paper considers cosmic ray propagation in the presence of a\nturbulent spiral magnetic field, analogous to that produced by the Solar wind.\nThe interaction of this wind with the interstellar medium defines a transition\nradius, analogous to the Heliopause, which provides the outer boundary to this\nproblem.

In the first case, mainly the energetics of the events is consistent\nwith the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability, as\nwell as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties\nof the collapsing massive stars. In the latter case, the recent discovery of\nthe binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger in the gravitational wave observation\nmade by LIGO (GW170817), and the detection of associated electromagnetic\ncounterparts, for the first time gave a direct proof of the NS-NS merger being\na progenitor of a short GRB.\n  In general, all GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a\nrotationally supported torus, or by fast rotation of a compact object. For long\nones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support\naccretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the\nrotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of\nthe relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH\nrotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields. The\njets must break through the stellar envelope though, which poses a question on\nthe efficiency of this process. Similar mechanisms of powering the jet ejection\nmay act in short GRBs, which in this case may freely propagate through the\ninterstellar medium. The power of the jets launched from the rotating black\nhole is at first associated mostly with the magnetic Poynting flux, and then at\nlarge distances it is transferred to the kinetic and finally radiative energy\nof the expanding shells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 12:04:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 14:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

The\nequatorial middle atmospheres of the Earth, Jupiter and Saturn all exhibit a\nremarkably similar phenomenon - a vertical, cyclic pattern of alternating\ntemperatures and zonal (east-west) wind regimes that propagate slowly downwards\nwith a well-defined multi-Earth-year period.

Here we reveal that Saturn's equatorial\nQuasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO, with a ~15-year period) can also be\ndramatically perturbed. An intense springtime storm erupted at Saturn's\nnorthern mid-latitudes in December 2010, spawning a gigantic hot vortex in the\nstratosphere at $40^\\circ$N that persisted for 3 years. Far from the storm, the\nCassini temperature measurements showed a dramatic $\\sim10$-K cooling in the\n0.5-5 mbar range across the entire equatorial region, disrupting the regular\nQPO pattern and significantly altering the middle-atmospheric wind structure,\nsuggesting an injection of westward momentum into the equatorial wind system\nfrom waves generated by the northern storm. Hence, as on Earth, meteorological\nactivity at mid-latitudes can have a profound effect on the regular atmospheric\ncycles in the tropics, demonstrating that waves can provide horizontal\nteleconnections between the phenomena shaping the middle atmospheres of giant\nplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 12:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

Statistically\ncomparing the RM distributions of two quasar samples, with and without\nabsorption line systems, allows one to infer magnetic field properties of the\nintervening galaxy population. Here, we have derived the analytical form of the\nprobability distribution function (PDF) of RM produced by a single galaxy with\nan axisymmetric large-scale magnetic field. We then further determine the PDF\nof RM for one random sight line traversing each galaxy in a population with a\nlarge-scale magnetic field prescription. We find that the resulting PDF of RM\nis dominated by a Lorentzian with a width that is directly related to the mean\naxisymmetric large-scale field strength $\\langle B_0 \\rangle$ of the galaxy\npopulation if the dispersion of $B_0$ within the population is smaller than\n$\\langle B_0 \\rangle$.

In the original scheme, the work output depends on the\ninsertion and removal position of an impenetrable barrier that acts like a\npiston, separating the chambers of the engine. Here, we show that the barrier\nremoval process can be made fully reversible, resulting in a full\ninformation-to-work conversion if we also allow for the interaction strength to\nchange during the cycle. Hence, it becomes possible to reach the maximum work\noutput per cycle dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. These findings\ncan, for instance, be experimentally verified with ultra-cold atoms as a\nworking medium, where a change of interaction strength can be controlled by\nFeshbach resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 13:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The presence of triple and\nquartic gauge couplings in the process gives access to the gauge sector of the\nStandard Model (SM) and possible new-physics contributions there. To test any\nnew-physics hypothesis, sound knowledge of the SM contributions is necessary,\nwith a precision which at least matches the experimental uncertainties of\nexisting and forthcoming measurements. In this article we present a detailed\nstudy of the vector-boson scattering process with two positively-charged\nleptons and missing transverse momentum in the final state. In particular, we\nfirst carry out a systematic comparison of the various approximations that are\nusually performed for this kind of process against the complete calculation, at\nLO and NLO QCD accuracy. Such a study is performed both in the usual fiducial\nregion used by experimental collaborations and in a more inclusive phase space,\nwhere the differences among the various approximations lead to more sizeable\neffects. Afterwards, we turn to predictions matched to parton showers, at LO\nand NLO: we show that on the one hand, the inclusion of NLO QCD corrections\nleads to more stable predictions, but on the other hand the details of the\nmatching and of the parton-shower programs cause differences which are\nconsiderably larger than those observed at fixed order, even in the\nexperimental fiducial region. We conclude with recommendations for experimental\nstudies of vector-boson scattering processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 14:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2018 09:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Thence, traditional sequential design\nparadigms become insufficient and, in contrast, resilient sequential designs\nthat adapt against system-wide attacks, deletions, or failures become\nimportant.

In this paper, we propose a\nmodularity based community detection framework for heterogeneous networks.\nUnlike existing methods, the proposed approach has the flexibility to treat the\nnumber of communities as an unknown quantity. We describe a Louvain type\nmaximization method for finding the community structure that maximizes the\nmodularity function. Our simulation results show the advantages of the proposed\nmethod over existing methods. Moreover, the proposed modularity function is\nshown to be consistent under a heterogeneous stochastic blockmodel framework.\nAnalyses of the DBLP four-area dataset and a MovieLens dataset demonstrate the\nusefulness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 15:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-23"}

However, there are several\ninfectious diseases that can transmit when a susceptible individual visits a\nlocation after an infected individual has left.

The resulting spacetime is topologically trivial, free\nof curvature singularities and is both time and space orientable; besides, the\ninner region enclosed by the smaller torus is flat and displays geodesic CTCs.\nOur model shares some similarities with the time machine of Ori and Soen but it\nhas the advantage of a higher symmetry in the metric, allowing for the explicit\ncomputation of a class of geodesics. The most remarkable feature emerging from\nthis computation is the presence of future-oriented timelike geodesics starting\nfrom a point in the outer Minkowskian region, moving to the inner spacetime\nregion with CTCs, and then returning to the initial spatial position at an\nearlier time; this means that time travel to the past can be performed by free\nfall across our time machine. The amount of time travelled into the past is\ndetermined quantitatively; this amount can be made arbitrarily large keeping\nnon-large the proper duration of the travel. An important drawback of the model\nis the violation of the classical energy conditions, a common feature of many\ntime machines. Other problems emerge from our computations of the required\n(negative) energy densities and of the tidal accelerations; these are small\nonly if the time machine is gigantic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 17:04:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 17:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 13:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

We also explore the effect of wetting liquid on the conformation\ndeveloped. When released from an altitude, the thread conformation changes when\nfree falling and reaches the stable conformation (identified by a constant\nend-to-end distance) after fall over a period of time. We identified that the\nconformation of the threads replicated the conformation of long polymer chains.\nTherefore, we applied a two-dimensional random walk model to explain the stable\nconformation where the thread length is treated as the random walk time (number\nof polymer segment). A two-dimensional random walk model was used since during\nfree fall, the conformation is assumed to develop on the horizontal plane.\nSurprisingly, we get the scaling power that is exactly similar to the scale\npower of two dimensional random (walk). By fitting how end-to-end distance\nchanges with time, we obtain an equation that is exactly similar to modified\nAvrami equation for process of phase transformation in one-dimension space (D =\n1), where the exponential power is n = D+1 = 2. Therefore, we can state that\nthe time evolution of thread conformation process is identical to\ncrystallization process in one dimensional space. This is very interesting\nfinding, showing that the microscopic process (crystallization) can be\nreplicated in macroscopic scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 00:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

The fluctuating bore liquid flow\nrate translates into axial membrane properties varying with respect to inner\nbore diameter and wall thickness.
