The flavour symmetries obtained\nin this way are shown to be free of ABJ anomalies, and their 't Hooft anomaly\npolynomial in the decoupling limit is obtained explicitly.

We show with simulated and real data that the\none-step boosted forest has a reduced bias compared to the original random\nforest. The paper also provides a variance estimate of the one-step boosted\nforest by an extension of the infinitesimal Jackknife estimator. Using this\nvariance estimate we can construct prediction intervals for the boosted forest\nand we show that they have good coverage probabilities. Combining the bias\nreduction and the variance estimate we show that the one-step boosted forest\nhas a significant reduction in predictive mean squared error and thus an\nimprovement in predictive performance. When applied on datasets from the UCI\ndatabase, one-step boosted forest performs better than random forest and\ngradient boosting machine algorithms.

State-of-the-art methods for Monocular\nDepth Estimation are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A promising\nline of work consists of introducing additional semantic information about the\ntraffic scene when training CNNs for depth estimation.

Even if stellar winds would not directly halt & reverse\nmass accretion during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar\nmergers stellar wind mass loss may dominate over the rate at which stellar\ngrowth takes place.

Planet habitability models traditionally focus on abiotic\nprocesses and neglect a biotic response to changing conditions on an inhabited\nplanet. The Gaia hypothesis postulates that life influences the Earth's\nfeedback mechanisms to form a self-regulating system, and hence that life can\nmaintain habitable conditions on its host planet. If life has a strong\ninfluence, it will have a role in determining a planet's habitability over\ntime. We present the ExoGaia model - a model of simple 'planets' host to\nevolving microbial biospheres. Microbes interact with their host planet via\nconsumption and excretion of atmospheric chemicals. Model planets orbit a\n'star' which provides incoming radiation, and atmospheric chemicals have either\nan albedo, or a heat-trapping property. Planetary temperatures can therefore be\naltered by microbes via their metabolisms. We seed multiple model planets with\nlife while their atmospheres are still forming and find that the microbial\nbiospheres are, under suitable conditions, generally able to prevent the host\nplanets from reaching inhospitable temperatures, as would happen on a lifeless\nplanet. We find that the underlying geochemistry plays a strong role in\ndetermining long-term habitability prospects of a planet. We find five distinct\nclasses of model planets, including clear examples of 'Gaian bottlenecks' - a\nphenomenon whereby life either rapidly goes extinct leaving an inhospitable\nplanet, or survives indefinitely maintaining planetary habitability.

A\nvideo can be thought of as being governed by two factors: (i) temporally\ninvariant (e.g., person identity), or slowly varying (e.g., activity),\nattribute-induced appearance, encoding the persistent content of each frame,\nand (ii) an inter-frame motion or scene dynamics (e.g., encoding evolution of\nthe person ex-ecuting the action). Based on this intuition, we propose a\ngenerative framework for video generation and future prediction. The proposed\nframework generates a video (short clip) by decoding samples sequentially drawn\nfrom a latent space distribution into full video frames. Variational\nAutoencoders (VAEs) are used as a means of encoding/decoding frames into/from\nthe latent space and RNN as a wayto model the dynamics in the latent space. We\nimprove the video generation consistency through temporally-conditional\nsampling and quality by structuring the latent space with attribute controls;\nensuring that attributes can be both inferred and conditioned on during\nlearning/generation. As a result, given attributes and/orthe first frame, our\nmodel is able to generate diverse but highly consistent sets ofvideo sequences,\naccounting for the inherent uncertainty in the prediction task.

In existing studies, mixing is\ngenerated by maps that repeat the same cut-and-shuffle process at every\niteration, in a \"fixed\" manner. However, mixing can be greatly improved by\nvarying the cut-and-shuffle parameters at each step, using a \"variable\"\napproach. To demonstrate this approach, we show how to optimize mixing by\ncutting-and-shuffling on the one-dimensional line interval, known as an\ninterval exchange transformation (IET). Mixing can be significantly improved by\noptimizing variable protocols, especially for initial conditions more complex\nthan just a simple two-color line interval. While we show that optimal variable\nIETs can be found analytically for arbitrary numbers of iterations, for more\ncomplex cutting-and-shuffling systems, computationally expensive numerical\noptimization methods would be required. Furthermore, the number of control\nparameters grows linearly with the number of iterations in variable systems.\nTherefore, optimizing over large numbers of iterations is generally\ncomputationally prohibitive. We demonstrate an ad hoc approach to\ncutting-and-shuffling that is computationally inexpensive and guarantees the\nmixing metric is within a constant factor of the optimum.

To learn discriminative pose\nfeatures, we integrate three new capabilities into a deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN): an inference scheme that combines both classification and pose\nregression based on a uniform tessellation of the Special Euclidean group in\nthree dimensions (SE(3)), the fusion of class priors into the training process\nvia a tiled class map, and an additional regularization using deep supervision\nwith an object mask. Further, an efficient multi-view framework is formulated\nto address single-view ambiguity. We show that this framework consistently\nimproves the performance of the single-view network. We evaluate our method on\nthree large-scale benchmarks: YCB-Video, JHUScene-50 and ObjectNet-3D. Our\napproach achieves competitive or superior performance over the current\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 16:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

These nodes/devices are likely to be powered by a\nHybrid Access Point (HAP) wirelessly, and may be programmed by the HAP with a\n{\\em sampling time} to collect sensory data, carry out computation, and\ntransmit sensed data to the HAP. A key challenge, however, is random channel\ngains, which cause sensor nodes to receive varying amounts of Radio Frequency\n(RF) energy. To this end, we formulate a stochastic program to determine the\ncharging time of the HAP and sampling time of sensor nodes. Our objective is to\nminimize the {\\em expected} penalty incurred when sensor nodes experience an\nenergy shortfall. We consider two cases: {\\em single} and {\\em multi} time\nslots. In the former, we determine a suitable HAP charging time and nodes\nsampling time on a slot-by-slot basis whilst the latter considers the best\ncharging and sampling time for use in the next $T$ slots. We conduct\nexperiments over channel gains drawn from the Gaussian, Rayleigh or Rician\ndistribution. Numerical results confirm our stochastic program can be used to\ncompute good charging and sampling times that incur the minimum penalty over\nthe said distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 19:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-23"}

However,\nthis has significantly hindered the ability to solve large scale, fully\nthree-dimensional problems involving complex deformations and electromechanical\ninstabilities of DEs. In this work, we provide theoretical basis for the\neffectiveness and accuracy of staggered explicit-implicit finite element\nformulations for this class of electromechanically coupled materials, and\nelicit the simplicity of the resulting staggered formulation. We demonstrate\nthe stability and accuracy of the staggered approach by solving complex\nelectromechanically coupled problems involving electroactive polymers, where we\nfocus on problems involving electromechanical instabilities such as creasing,\nwrinkling, and bursting drops. In all examples, essentially identical results\nto the fully monolithic solution are obtained, showing the accuracy of the\nstaggered approach at a significantly reduced computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 23:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

From the perspective of systemic\nrisk it is important to understand the influence of this network structure on\ndefault contagion. Using sparse random graphs to model the financial network,\nasymptotic methods turned out powerful to analytically describe the contagion\nprocess and to make statements about resilience. So far, however, they have\nbeen limited to so-called {\\em rank one} models in which informally the only\nnetwork parameter is the degree sequence (see (Amini et. al. 2016) and\n(Detering et. al. 2019) for example) and the contagion process can be described\nby a one dimensional fix-point equation. These networks fail to account for a\npronounced block structure such as core/periphery or a network composed of\ndifferent connected blocks for different countries. We present a much more\ngeneral model here, where we distinguish vertices (institutions) of different\ntypes and let edge probabilities and exposures depend on the types of both, the\nreceiving and the sending vertex plus additional parameters. Our main result\nallows to compute explicitly the systemic damage caused by some initial local\nshock event, and we derive a complete characterisation of resilient\nrespectively non-resilient financial systems. This is the first instance that\ndefault contagion is rigorously studied in a model outside the class of rank\none models and several technical challenges arise. Moreover, in contrast to\nprevious work, in which networks could be classified as resilient or non\nresilient, independent of the distribution of the shock, information about the\nshock becomes important in our model and a more refined resilience condition\narises. Among other applications of our theory we derive resilience conditions\nfor the global network based on subnetwork conditions only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 23:19:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 08:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 16:15:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 19:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

It remains an open challenge for how to devise and train a\nhigh-quality detector that can achieve more precise localization (i.e.,\nIoU$>$0.5) without sacrificing the detection performance. In this paper, we\npropose a novel single-shot detection framework of Bidirectional Pyramid\nNetworks (BPN) towards high-quality object detection, which consists of two\nnovel components: (i) a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid structure for more\neffective and robust feature representations; and (ii) a Cascade Anchor\nRefinement to gradually refine the quality of predesigned anchors for more\neffective training.

These characterisations are based on a\nstandard approach for measuring the \"size\" of a knot within a knotted polymer\nchain. The method involves associating knot-types to subarcs of the chain, and\nthen identifying a knotted subarc with minimal arclength; this arclength is\nthen the knot-size. If the resulting knot-size is small relative to the whole\nlength of the chain, then the knot is considered to be localised or \"local\". If\non the other hand the knot-size is comparable to the length of the chain, then\nthe knot is considered to be \"non-local\".\n  Using this definition, we establish that all but exponentially few\nsufficiently long self-avoiding polygons (closed chains) in a tubular\nsublattice of the simple cubic lattice are \"non-locally\" knotted. This is shown\nto also hold for the case when the same polygons are subject to an external\ntensile force, as well as in the extreme case when they are as compact as\npossible (no empty lattice sites).

Both spatial and\nangular GH shifts are present. For both GH shifts in general, we find that\nincreasing the Fermi level shifts the incident angle at which the maximum GH\nshifts arise. Moreover, we see that at higher frequencies, the amount of beam\nshift decreases with the Fermi level when the incident frequency is changed. At\nlower frequencies, however, the shift becomes proportional with the Fermi\nlevel. Upon obtaining the measurable shifts, the angular GH shift dominates the\nspatial GH shift given appropriate experimental parameters.

In particular, the pseudogap\nvanishes in a finite region around the anti-nodal point, in which a single\nbroadened peak emerges at the un-renormalized quasiparticle energy. Such an\nobservation is argued to be inconsistent with the antiferromagnetic(AFM)\nband-folding picture, which predicts a constant pseudogap along the AFBZ\nboundary. On the other hand, it is claimed that the experimental results are\nconsistent with the prediction of the cluster dynamical mean field\ntheory(CDMFT) simulation on the Hubbard model, in which the pseudogap is\ninterpreted as a s-wave splitting between the Hubbard bands and the in-gap\nstates. Here we show that the observed momentum dependence of the pseudogap is\nindeed consistent with AFM band-folding picture, provided that we assume the\nexistence of a strongly momentum dependent quasiparticle scattering rate. More\nspecifically, we show that the quasiparticle scattering rate acts to reduce the\nspectral gap induced by AFM band-folding effect. The new quasiparticle poles\ncorresponding to the AF-split bands can even be totally eliminated when the\nscattering rate exceeds the bare band folding gap, leaving the system with a\nsingle pole at the un-renormalized quasiparticle energy.

To aid in processing the information, new methods need to be found\nto present multi-modal patient data, ideally combining textual, imagery,\ntemporal and 3D data in a holistic and context-aware system. Methods: We\npresent an open-source framework which allows handling of patient data in a\nvirtual reality (VR) environment. By using VR technology, the workspace\navailable to the surgeon is maximized and 3D patient data is rendered in\nstereo, which increases depth perception. The framework organizes the data into\nworkspaces and contains tools which allow users to control, manipulate and\nenhance the data. Due to the framework's modular design, it can easily be\nadapted and extended for various clinical applications. Results: The framework\nwas evaluated by clinical personnel (77 participants). The majority of the\ngroup stated that a complex surgical situation is easier to comprehend by using\nthe framework, and that it is very well suited for education. Furthermore, the\napplication to various clinical scenarios - including the simulation of\nexcitation-propagation in the human atrium - demonstrated the framework's\nadaptability. As a feasibility study, the framework was used during the\nplanning phase of the surgical removal of a large central carcinoma from a\npatient's liver.

The various\napplications confirmed that the framework is easily extended and can be used in\nreal-time simulation as well as for the manipulation of complex anatomical\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 08:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-23"}

We show that this Taylor series\ncan be used to obtain a hierarchy of increasingly accurate approximate tests\nwith low computational complexity. These approximate tests are then used to\nestimate the threshold of synchronization as well as the position of the\nsynchronization manifold of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:23:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 09:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

We define the node set lattice through the well known binary\noperations of ternary set partitions and show the resultant lattice is\nisomorphic to C3^J where C3 is the 3 element chain CRDSA. We derive that every\nCRDSA is a subdirect product of C3 similarly as for Boolean algebras and C2. We\nuse these results to show that every Boolean algebra is the center of some\nCRDSA. Next we show that C3 is primal implying that the variety generated by it\nis dually equivalent to the category of Boolean algebras. In some sense this is\na last step towards our goal of establishing CRDSA as nearly Boolean, but\nleaves us a bit dissatisfied. Hence we continue by establishing a duality\nbetween the category of CRDSA and specifically crafted bi-topological spaces.\nTowards this end we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions on a\npairwise zero-dimensional space such that it will have a CRDSA base B1. We note\nthat these conditions are indicative of how nearly Boolean CRDSA are. For\nexample, if u in B1 is not clopen/complemented then Cl(u) is in B1 and is\nclopen/complemented. Then we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for\na bi-continuous map to have an inverse that is a CRDSA homomorphism again\nindicating how nearly Boolean CRDSA are, these inverses must respect the\nappropriate conditions on the boundary of non-clopen elements of B1.

For embedded devices,\nthese security-critical branches are a preferred target of fault attacks as a\nsingle bit flip or skipping a single instruction can lead to complete access to\na system. In the past, numerous redundancy schemes have been proposed in order\nto provide control-flow-integrity (CFI) and to enable error detection on\nprocessed data. However, current countermeasures for general purpose software\ndo not provide protection mechanisms for conditional branches. Hence, critical\nbranches are in practice often simply duplicated.\n  We present a generic approach to protect conditional branches, which links an\nencoding-based comparison result with the redundancy of CFI protection\nmechanisms. The presented approach can be used for all types of data encodings\nand CFI mechanisms and maintains their error-detection capabilities throughout\nall steps of a conditional branch. We demonstrate our approach by realizing an\nencoded comparison based on AN-codes, which is a frequently used encoding\nscheme to detect errors on data during arithmetic operations.

The magnitude of magnetic field and the magnetic flux\nin the vicinity of a central black hole is predicted by theoretical models. On\nthe other hand, the magnetic field in a jet can be estimated through\nmeasurements of either the core shift effect or the brightness temperature. In\nboth cases the obtained magnetic field is in the radiating domain, so its\ndirect application to the calculation of the magnetic flux needs some\ntheoretical assumptions. In this paper we address the issue of estimating the\nmagnetic flux contained in a jet using the measurements of a core shift effect\nand of a brightness temperature for the jets, directed almost at the observer.\nThe accurate account for the jet transversal structure allow us to express the\nmagnetic flux through the observed values and an unknown rotation rate of\nmagnetic surfaces. If we assume the sources are in a magnetically arrested disk\nstate, the lower limit for the rotation rate can be obtained. On the other\nhand, the flux estimate may be tested against the total jet power predicted by\nthe electromagnetic energy extraction model. The resultant expression for power\ndepends logarithmically weakly on an unknown rotation rate. We show that the\ntotal jet power estimated through the magnetic flux is in good agreement with\nthe observed power.

The end-to-end\nlearning is achieved by directly embedding the atmospheric scattering model\ninto the network, thereby ensuring that the proposed method strictly follows\nthe physics-driven scattering model for dehazing. Inspired by the dense network\nthat can maximize the information flow along features from different levels, we\npropose a new edge-preserving densely connected encoder-decoder structure with\nmulti-level pyramid pooling module for estimating the transmission map. This\nnetwork is optimized using a newly introduced edge-preserving loss function.

An ablation\nstudy is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module evaluated at\nboth estimated transmission map and dehazed result.

It is the\nfundamental mechanism by which biological materials grow, starting from the\nlevel of a single cell, and is increasingly applied in engineering processes\nfor fabrication and self-assembly. A significant complexity in describing the\nkinetics of such processes arises due to their inherent coupled interaction\nwith the diffusing constituents that are needed to sustain the growth, and the\ninfluence of local stresses on the growth rates. Moreover, changes in\nconcentration of solvent within the bulk of the body, generated by diffusion,\ncan affect volumetric changes, thus leading to an additional interacting growth\nmechanism. In this paper we present a general theoretical framework that\ncaptures these complexities to describe the kinetics of surface growth while\naccounting for coupled diffusion. Then, by combination of analytical and\nnumerical tools, applied to a simple growth geometry, we show that the\nevolution of such growth processes rapidly tends towards a universal path that\nis independent of initial conditions. This path, on which surface growth\nmechanisms and diffusion act harmoniously, can be extended to analytically\nportray the evolution of a body from inception up to a treadmilling state, in\nwhich addition and removal of material are balanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

We obtain the\ntime evolution of synthetic spectra for a dozen of selected species as well as\nratios of their integrated intensities. We find that some molecules such as C,\nN2H+, CN, and HCO do not trace the inner core and so are not good tracers to\ndistinguish the HII/PDR regions to the HMCs phase. On the contrary, C+ and O\ntrace the internal PDRs, in the two models starting with different initial\nabundances, but are unfortunately currently unobservable with the current\nachievable spatial resolution because of the very thin internal PDR (r < 100\nAU). In addition, we find that the abundance profiles are highly affected by\nthe choice of the initial abundances, hence the importance to properly define\nthem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

By the third kind of Bayes'\ntheorem, we can directly convert a Shannon's channel into an optimized semantic\nchannel. When a sample is not big enough, we can use a truth function with\nparameters to produce the likelihood function, then train the truth function by\nthe conditional sampling distribution. The third kind of Bayes' theorem is\nproved. A semantic information theory is simply introduced. The semantic\ninformation measure reflects Popper's hypothesis-testing thought. The Semantic\nInformation Method (SIM) adheres to maximum semantic information criterion\nwhich is compatible with maximum likelihood criterion and Regularized Least\nSquares criterion. It supports Wittgenstein's view: the meaning of a word lies\nin its use. Letting the two channels mutually match, we obtain the Channels'\nMatching (CM) algorithm for machine learning.

The semantic channel for medical tests and the confirmation measures of\ntest-positive and test-negative are discussed. The applications of the CM\nalgorithm to semi-supervised learning and non-supervised learning are simply\nintroduced. As a predictive model, the semantic channel fits variable sources\nand hence can overcome class-imbalance problem.

I present a\nconstruction to systematically generate anyon models. The construction uses a\nset of elementary pieces or fundamental anyon models, which constitute the\nbuilding blocks to construct other, more complex, anyon models. A principle of\nassembly is established that dictates how to articulate the building blocks,\nsetting out the global blueprint for the whole structure. Remarkably, the\nconstruction generates essentially all tabulated anyon models. Moreover, novel\nanyon models (non-tabulated, to my knowledge) arise. To embody the construction\nI develop a very physical, visual and intuitive lexicon. An anyon model\ncorresponds to a system of bosons in a lattice. By varying the number of bosons\nand the number of lattice sites, towers of more and more complex anyon models\nare built up. It is a Boson-Lattice construction. A self-similar anatomy is\nrevealed: an anyon model is a graph that is filled with bosons to engender a\nnew graph that is again filled with bosons. And further, bosons curve the graph\nthat the anyon model is: I disclose a geography in the space of anyon models,\nwhere one is born from another by deforming the geometry of space.

Considering acoustic waves in a homogeneous\nmedium, we compare travel-time and amplitude measurements extracted from the\ndeep-focusing cross-covariance functions. Using a single-scattering\napproximation, we find that the spatial sensitivity of deep-focusing travel\ntimes to sound-speed perturbations is zero at the target location and maximum\nin a surrounding shell. This is unlike the deep-focusing amplitude\nmeasurements, which have maximum sensitivity at the target point. We compare\nthe signal-to-noise ratio for travel-time and amplitude measurements for\ndifferent types of sound-speed perturbations, under the assumption that noise\nis solely due to the random excitation of the waves. We find that, for highly\nlocalized perturbations in sound speed, the signal-to-noise ratio is higher for\namplitude measurements than for travel-time measurements.

However, it is challenging to satisfy the essential features\nwithout sacrifice in conventional technical values including resolution, frame\nrate, and eye-box. Here, we present a new type of 3D displays: tomographic\ndisplays. We claim that tomographic displays may support extremely wide depth\nof field, quasi-continuous accommodation, omni-directional motion parallax,\npreserved resolution, full frame, and moderate field of view within enough\neye-box. Tomographic displays consist of focus-tunable optics, 2D display\npanel, and fast spatially adjustable backlight.

An analysis of raw\nobservations of 2,333 type Ia supernovae light-curves shows that their widths,\nrelative to a standard template, have a power-law exponent as a function of\n${(1+z)}$, of (0.083 +/- 0.024) which is consistent with no time dilation and\ninconsistent with standard time dilation.
