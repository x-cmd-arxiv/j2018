A fast statistical test is implemented to detect deviations\naway from, and recovery back to, this distribution when trains pass over the\nbridge, yielding a recovery time.

Herein we use density\nfunctional theory calculations to investigate whether there is an intrinsic\nRaman shift in the h-BN monolayer in comparison with the bulk. There is\nuniversal agreement among all tested functionals in predicting the magnitude of\nthe frequency shift upon a variation in the in-plane cell parameter. It is\nclear that a small in-plane contraction can explain the Raman peak upshift from\nbulk to monolayer. However, we show that the larger in-plane parameter in the\nbulk (compared to the monolayer) results from non-local correlation effects,\nwhich cannot be accounted for by local functionals or those with empirical\ndispersion corrections. Using a non-local-correlation functional, we then\ninvestigate the effect of finite temperatures on the Raman signature. We\ndemonstrate that bulk h-BN thermally expands in the direction perpendicular to\nthe layers, while the intralayer distances slightly contract, in agreement with\nobserved experimental behavior. Interestingly, the difference in in-plane cell\nparameter between bulk and monolayer decreases with temperature, and becomes\nvery small at room temperature.

The constraints\ncome from imposing the absence of any non-SUSY AdS stable vacua obtained from\nany consistent compactification of the SM to 3 or 2 dimensions. This condition\ncomes as a corollary of a recent extension of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC)\nby Ooguri and Vafa. In this paper we study $T^2/Z_N$ compactifications of the\nSM to two dimensions in which SM Wilson lines are projected out, leading to a\nconsiderable simplification. We analyze in detail a $T^ 2/Z_4$ compactification\nof the SM in which both complex structure and Wilson line scalars are fixed and\nthe potential is only a function of the area of the torus $a^2$. We find that\nthe SM is not robust against the appearance of AdS vacua in 2D and hence would\nbe by itself inconsistent with quantum gravity. On the contrary, if the SM is\nembedded at some scale $M_{SS}$ into a SUSY version like the MSSM, the AdS\nvacua present in the non-SUSY case disappear or become unstable. This means\nthat WGC arguments favor a SUSY version of the SM, independently of the usual\nhierarchy problem arguments. In a $T^2/Z_4$ compactification in which the\norbifold action is embedded into the $B-L$ symmetry the bounds on neutrino\nmasses and the cosmological constant are recovered. This suggests that the MSSM\nshould be extended with a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge group. In other families of vacua\nthe spectrum of SUSY particles is further constrained in order to avoid the\nappearance of new AdS vacua or instabilities.

We argue that\nthis late-time behavior is a generic feature of unitary dynamics with energy\nconservation. Finally, by comparing the OTOC with a commutator-anticommutator\ncorrelation function, we examine whether there is a time window over which a\ntypical Hamiltonian behaves as a \"coherent scrambler\" in the language of Ref.\n\\cite{Kitaev_IAS, Kitaev_Suh}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-23"}

In some cases, the patterns form self-similar,\nfractal geometric clusters. In this paper, we advance the theory of criticality\nas it pertains to those geometric clusters (defined as connected sets of\nnearest-neighbor aligned spins) in the context of Ising models. We show how\ndata from surface probes can be used to distinguish whether electronic patterns\nobserved at the surface of a material are confined to the surface, or whether\nthe patterns originate in the bulk. Whereas thermodynamic critical exponents\nare derived from the behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters, critical\nexponents can be similarly defined for geometric clusters. We find that these\ngeometric critical exponents are not only distinct numerically from the\nthermodynamic and uncorrelated percolation exponents, but that they separately\nsatisfy scaling relations at the critical fixed points discussed in the text.\nWe furthermore find that the two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections of geometric\nclusters in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model display critical scaling\nbehavior at the bulk phase transition temperature. In particular, we show that\nwhen considered on a 2D slice of a 3D system, the pair connectivity function\nfamiliar from percolation theory displays more robust critical behavior than\nthe spin-spin correlation function, and we calculate the corresponding critical\nexponent. We discuss the implications of these two distinct length scales in\nIsing models. We also calculate the pair connectivity exponent in the clean 2D\ncase. These results extend the theory of geometric criticality in the clean\nIsing universality classes, and facilitate the broad application of geometric\ncluster analysis techniques to maximize the information that can be extracted\nfrom scanning image probe data in condensed matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Contemporaneous data from Chandra, HST, and Swift\nare used to model the optical-UV-X-ray continuum and determine the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) at two epochs, 13 years apart. For our investigation\nwe use new observations taken in December 2015-January 2016, and historical\nones taken in December 2002. We study the impact of a change in the SED shape,\nseen between the two epochs, on the photoionisation of the wind. The HETGS\nspectroscopy shows that the AGN wind in NGC 7469 consists of four ionisation\ncomponents, with their outflow velocities ranging from -400 to -1800 km/s. From\nour modelling we find that the change in the ionising continuum shape between\nthe two epochs results in some variation in the ionisation state of the wind\ncomponents. However, for the main ions detected in X-rays, the sum of their\ncolumn densities over all four components, remains in practice unchanged. For\ntwo of the four components, which are found to be thermally unstable in both\nepochs, we obtain 2 < r < 31 pc and 12 < r < 29 pc using the cooling and\nrecombination timescales. For the other two thermally stable components, we\nobtain r < 31 pc and r < 80 pc from the recombination timescale. The results of\nour photoionisation modelling and thermal stability analysis suggest that the\nabsorber components in NGC 7469 are consistent with being a thermally-driven\nwind from the AGN torus. Finally, from analysis of the zeroth-order ACIS/HETG\ndata, we discover that the X-ray emission between 0.2-1 keV is spatially\nextended over 1.5-12\". This diffuse soft X-ray emission is explained by coronal\nemission from the nuclear starburst ring in NGC 7469.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Routing of messages along shortest paths\nrequires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion,\nwhich operates according to local topological features, is informationally\n\"cheap\" but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network\ncommunication that combines varying amounts of local and global information\nabout the network topology. The model generates a continuous spectrum of\ndynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion)\ncommunication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two\ncohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying\namounts of local and global information on the network's communication cost. We\nidentify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path\ncommunication process with a relatively small amount of global information.\nMoreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes\nvaries as a function of the amount of global information driving the system's\ndynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject\ndifferences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework\ndeparts from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, suggesting\ninstead that brain networks may exhibit different types of communication\ndynamics depending on varying functional demands and the availability of\nresources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

In this work, we use the emerging\nconcept of the tree partition of transmission networks to provide an analytical\ncharacterization of line failure localizability in transmission systems. Our\nresults rigorously establish the well perceived intuition in power community\nthat failures cannot cross bridges, and reveal a finer-grained concept that\nencodes more precise information on failure propagations within tree-partition\nregions. Specifically, when a non-bridge line is tripped, the impact of this\nfailure only propagates within well-defined components, which we refer to as\ncells, of the tree partition defined by the bridges. In contrast, when a bridge\nline is tripped, the impact of this failure propagates globally across the\nnetwork, affecting the power flow on all remaining transmission lines. This\ncharacterization suggests that it is possible to improve the system robustness\nby temporarily switching off certain transmission lines, so as to create more,\nsmaller components in the tree partition; thus spatially localizing line\nfailures and making the grid less vulnerable to large-scale outages.

The scheme verifies safety of a proposed learning-based input and\nmodifies it as little as necessary in order to keep the system within a given\nset of constraints. Safety is thereby related to the existence of a model\npredictive controller (MPC) providing a feasible trajectory towards a safe\ntarget set. A robust MPC formulation accounts for the fact that the model is\ngenerally uncertain in the context of learning, which allows proving constraint\nsatisfaction at all times under the proposed MPSC strategy.

In\nmost applications, the time-series data obtained from simulation or experiment\nis corrupted with either measurement or process noise or both. The existing\nresults show the applicability of algorithms developed for the finite\ndimensional approximation of deterministic system to a random uncertain case.\nHowever, these results hold true only in asymptotic and under the assumption of\ninfinite data set. In practice the data set is finite, and hence it is\nimportant to develop algorithms that explicitly account for the presence of\nuncertainty in data-set. We propose a robust optimization-based framework for\nthe robust approximation of the transfer operators, where the uncertainty in\ndata-set is treated as deterministic norm bounded uncertainty. The robust\noptimization leads to a min-max type optimization problem for the approximation\nof transfer operators. This robust optimization problem is shown to be\nequivalent to regularized least square problem. This equivalence between robust\noptimization problem and regularized least square problem allows us to comment\non various interesting properties of the obtained solution using robust\noptimization. In particular, the robust optimization formulation captures\ninherent tradeoffs between the quality of approximation and complexity of\napproximation. These tradeoffs are necessary to balance for the proposed\napplication of transfer operators, for the design of optimal predictor.\nSimulation results demonstrate that our proposed robust approximation algorithm\nperforms better than the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and DMD\nalgorithms for a system with process and measurement noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 19:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Consistent with our AP-MS and\nhistone array data suggesting a role in regulation of gene expression, ChIP-Seq\nanalysis of Ibd1 indicated that it primarily binds near promoters and within\ngene bodies of highly expressed genes during growth.\n  Conclusions: Our results suggest that through recognizing specific histones\nmarks, Ibd1 targets active chromatin regions of highly expressed genes in\nTetrahymena where it subsequently might coordinate the recruitment of several\nchromatin remodeling complexes to regulate the transcriptional landscape of\nvegetatively growing Tetrahymena cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 20:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-26"}

However, while at weak Hubbard repulsion both the spin and charge\nspectra can be understood in terms of weakly-interacting electron-hole\nexcitations across the Fermi surface, at intermediate coupling DMRG shows\ngapped spin excitations at large momentum transfer that remain gapless within\nthe RPA+FLEX approximation. For the charge response, RPA+FLEX can only\nreproduce the main features of the DMRG spectra at weak coupling and high\ndoping levels, while it shows an incoherent character away from this limit.\nOverall, our analysis shows that RPA+FLEX works surprisingly well for spin\nexcitations at weak and intermediate Hubbard $U$ values even in the difficult\nlow-dimensional geometry such as a two-leg ladder.

The main result is a multiversion transactional system\nthat supports constant delay (extra instructions beyond running in isolation)\nfor all read-only transactions, delay equal to the number of processes for\nwriting transactions that are not concurrent with other writers, and\nlock-freedom for concurrent writers. The system supports precise garbage\ncollection in that versions are identified for collection as soon as the last\ntransaction releases them. As far as we know these are first results that bound\ndelays for multiple readers and even a single writer. The approach is\nparticularly useful in situations where read-transactions dominate write\ntransactions, or where write transactions come in as streams or batches and can\nbe processed by a single writer (possibly in parallel).\n  The approach is based on using functional data structures to support multiple\nversions, and an efficient solution to the Version Maintenance (VM) problem for\nacquiring, updating and releasing versions. Our solution to the VM problem is\nprecise, safe and wait-free (PSWF).\n  We experimentally validate our approach by applying it to balanced tree data\nstructures for maintaining ordered maps. We test the transactional system using\nmultiple algorithms for the VM problem, including our PSWF VM algorithm, and\nimplementations with weaker guarantees based on epochs, hazard pointers, and\nread-copy-update.

In disordered systems, however, it remains challenging\nto compute the gap of large-size systems with specific realization of disorder.\nHitherto, only quantum Monte Carlo techniques are practical for such studies.\nRecently, Knysh [Nature Comm. \\textbf{7}, 12370 (2016)] proposed a method where\nthe exponentially large dimensionality of such systems is condensed onto a\nrandom potential of much lower dimension, enabling efficient study of such\nsystems.

For the former, unfair airtime allocation among the users will\nundermine their willingness to participate in MSNs. For the latter, a group\nhead is required to connect other users. These two problems have to be properly\naddressed to enable real implementation and adoption of MSNs. To this aim, we\npropose a Nash bargaining-based joint head selection and airtime allocation\nscheme for data dissemination within the group. Specifically, the bargaining\ngame of joint head selection and airtime allocation is first formulated. Then,\nNash bargaining solution (NBS) based optimization problems are proposed for a\nhomogeneous case and a more general heterogeneous case. For both cases, the\nexistence of solution to the optimization problem is proved, which guarantees\nPareto optimality and proportional fairness. Next, an algorithm, allowing\ndistributed implementation, for join head selection and airtime allocation is\nintroduced. Finally, numerical results are presented to evaluate the\nperformance, validate intuitions and derive insights of the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 01:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 21:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

A geometrical-optics (GO) reduction of\nCE2, derived under an assumption of separation of scales between the\nfluctuations and the zonal flow, is studied here numerically. The reduced\nmodel, CE2-GO, has a similar phase-space mathematical structure to the\ntraditional wave-kinetic equation, but that wave-kinetic equation has been\nshown to fail to preserve enstrophy conservation and to exhibit an ultraviolet\ncatastrophe.

The UK-EGO framework with automatic trend function\nselection derived from the BK and PCK models works by building a UK surrogate\nmodel and then performing optimizations via expected improvement criteria on\nthe Kriging model with the lowest leave-one-out cross-validation error. Next,\nwe studied and compared the UK-EGO variants and standard EGO using five\nsynthetic test functions and one aerodynamic problem. Our results show that the\nproper choice for the trend function through automatic feature selection can\nimprove the optimization performance of UK-EGO relative to EGO. From our\nresults, we found that PCK-EGO was the best variant, as it had more robust\nperformance as compared to the rest of the UK-EGO schemes; however, total-order\nexpansion should be used to generate the candidate trend function set for\nhigh-dimensional problems. Note that, for some test functions, the UK with\npredetermined polynomial trend functions performed better than that of BK and\nPCK, indicating that the use of automatic trend function selection does not\nalways lead to the best quality solutions.

While the elements until iron\nare either created during the big bang or during fusion reactions in stars,\nmost of the elements heavier than iron are produced via neutron-induced\nreactions. Therefore, neutron capture cross sections of stable and unstable\nisotopes are important. So far, time-of-flight or activation methods have been\napplied very successfully, but these methods reach their limits once the\nisotopes with half-lives shorter than a few months are of interest.

Spatially Regularized DCF (SRDCF) has\nbeen suggested to resolve this issue by enforcing spatial penalty on DCF\ncoefficients, which, inevitably, improves the tracking performance at the price\nof increasing complexity. To tackle online updating, SRDCF formulates its model\non multiple training images, further adding difficulties in improving\nefficiency. In this work, by introducing temporal regularization to SRDCF with\nsingle sample, we present our spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters\n(STRCF). Motivated by online Passive-Agressive (PA) algorithm, we introduce the\ntemporal regularization to SRDCF with single sample, thus resulting in our\nspatial-temporal regularized correlation filters (STRCF). The STRCF formulation\ncan not only serve as a reasonable approximation to SRDCF with multiple\ntraining samples, but also provide a more robust appearance model than SRDCF in\nthe case of large appearance variations. Besides, it can be efficiently solved\nvia the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

This resonance-like effect has its rationale in the tendency of the\ncurrent-driven Tayler instability to undergo intrinsic helicity oscillations\nwhich, in turn, can be synchronized by periodic tidal perturbations.\nSpecifically, we focus on the 11.07 years alignment periodicity of the tidally\ndominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, whose persistent synchronization\nwith the solar dynamo is briefly touched upon. The typically emerging dynamo\nmodes are dipolar fields, oscillating with a 22.14 years period or pulsating\nwith a 11.07 years period, but also quadrupolar fields with corresponding\nperiodicities. In the absence of any constant part of alpha, we prove the\nsubcritical nature of this Tayler-Spruit type dynamo. The resulting amplitude\nof the alpha oscillation that is required for dynamo action turns out to lie in\nthe order of 1 m/s, which seems not implausible for the sun. When starting with\na more classical, non-periodic part of alpha, even less of the oscillatory\nalpha part is needed to synchronize the entire dynamo. Typically, the dipole\nsolutions show butterfly diagrams, although their shapes are not convincing\nyet. Phase coherent transitions between dipoles and quadrupoles, which are\nreminiscent of the observed behaviour during the Maunder minimum, can be easily\ntriggered by long-term variations of dynamo parameters, but may also occur\nspontaneously even for fixed parameters.

The framework incorporates a parameterized cost model to\nassess the cost-benefit tradeoffs of applying prescriptive process monitoring\nin a given setting.

On the other hand, we have single-stage detectors, such as YOLO (You\nOnly Look Once) and SSD (Singe Shot MultiBox Detector), that treat object\ndetection as a simple regression problem by taking an input image and learning\nthe class probabilities and bounding box coordinates. Such models reach lower\naccuracy rates, but are much faster than two-stage object detectors. In this\npaper, we propose to use an image difficulty predictor to achieve an optimal\ntrade-off between accuracy and speed in object detection. The image difficulty\npredictor is applied on the test images to split them into easy versus hard\nimages. Once separated, the easy images are sent to the faster single-stage\ndetector, while the hard images are sent to the more accurate two-stage\ndetector.

The interaction of localized single spins with a\nconventional superconductor generally leads to intrinsically extremely narrow\nYu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonances protected inside the superconducting gap.\nHowever, this may not apply to superconductors with nontrivial, energy\ndependent order parameters. Exploiting the Fe-doped two-band superconductor\nNbSe$_2$, we show that due to the nontrivial relation between its complex\nvalued and energy dependent order parameters, YSR states are no longer\nrestricted to be inside the gap. They can appear outside the gap (i. e. inside\nthe coherence peaks), where they can also acquire a substantial intrinsic\nlifetime broadening. T-matrix scattering calculations show excellent agreement\nwith the experimental data and relate the intrinsic YSR state broadening to the\nimaginary part of the host's order parameters. Our results suggest that\nnon-thermal relaxation mechanisms contribute to the finite lifetime of the YSR\nstates, even within the superconducting gap, making them less protected against\nresidual interactions than previously assumed.

It is still an open question on how efficient this process\nworks in realistic turbulent discs. Here, we investigate the accretion of\npebbles in turbulent discs that are driven by the purely hydrodynamical\nvertical shear instability (VSI). For this purpose, we perform global\nthree-dimensional simulations of locally isothermal, VSI turbulent discs with\nembedded protoplanetary cores from 5 to 100 $M_\\oplus$ that are placed at 5.2\nau distance from the star. In addition, we follow the evolution of a swarm of\nembedded pebbles of different size under the action of drag forces between gas\nand particles in this turbulent flow. Simultaneously, we perform a set of\ncomparison simulations for laminar viscous discs where the particles experience\nstochastic kicks. For both cases, we measure the accretion rate onto the cores\nas a function of core mass and Stokes number ($\\tau_s$) of the particles and\ncompare it to recent MRI turbulence simulations. Overall the dynamic is very\nsimilar for the particles in the VSI turbulent disc and the laminar case with\nstochastic kicks. For the small mass planets (i.e. 5 and 10 $M_\\oplus$),\nwell-coupled particles with $\\tau_s = 1$, which have a size of about one meter\nat this location, we find an accretion efficiency (rate of particles accreted\nover drifting inward) of about 1.6-3%. For smaller and larger particles this\nefficiency is higher. However, the fast inward drift for $\\tau_s = 1$ particles\nmakes them the most effective for rapid growth, leading to mass doubling times\nof about 20,000 yr. For masses between 10 and 30 $M_\\oplus$ the core reaches\nthe pebble isolation mass and the particles are trapped at the pressure maximum\njust outside of the planet, shutting off further particle accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 10:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Among these energy bands, the type-II Dirac point is a\nnodal degeneracy with tilted conical dispersion, leading to a peculiar crossing\ndispersion in the constant energy plane. Such nodal points have recently been\nfound in electronic materials. The analogous topological feature in photonic\nsystems remains a theoretical curiosity, with experimental realization expected\nto be challenging. Here, we experimentally realize the type-II Dirac point\nusing a planar metasurface architecture, where the band degeneracy point is\nprotected by the underlying mirror symmetry of the metasurface. Gapless edge\nmodes are found and measured at the boundary between the different domains of\nthe symmetry-broken metasurface. Our work shows that metasurfaces are simple\nand practical platforms for realizing electromagnetic type-II Dirac points, and\ntheir planar structure is a distinct advantage that facilitates applications in\ntwo-dimensional topological photonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 11:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Turbulent heating is\nfar from uniform and is usually concentrated in small regions of intense\ndissipation, characterised by abrupt magnetic reconnection and higher\ntemperatures. These regions are of interest because they might generate\nnon-thermal emission, in the form of flares and energetic particles, or\nthermally process solids in protoplanetary disks. Moreover, the nature of the\ndissipation bears on the fundamental dynamics of the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) itself: local simulations indicate that the large-scale\nproperties of the turbulence (e.g. saturation levels, the stress-pressure\nrelationship) depend on the short dissipative scales. In this paper we\nundertake a numerical study of how the MRI dissipates and the small-scale\ndissipative structures it employs to do so. We use the Godunov code RAMSES and\nunstratified compressible shearing boxes. Our simulations reveal that\ndissipation is concentrated in ribbons of strong magnetic reconnection that are\nsignificantly elongated in azimuth, up to a scale height. Dissipative\nstructures are hence meso-scale objects, and potentially provide a route by\nwhich large scales and small scales interact. We go on to show how these\nribbons evolve over time --- forming, merging, breaking apart, and\ndisappearing. Finally, we reveal important couplings between the large-scale\ndensity waves generated by the MRI and the small-scale structures, which may\nilluminate the stress-pressure relationship in MRI turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 11:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

Unfortunately, many important streaming problems require a\n$\\Theta(\\log(n))$ multiplicative factor more space for turnstile streams than\nfor insertion-only streams. This complexity gap often arises because the\nunderlying frequency vector $f$ is very close to $0$, after accounting for all\ninsertions and deletions to items. Signal detection in such streams is\ndifficult, given the large number of deletions.\n  In this work, we propose an intermediate model which, given a parameter\n$\\alpha \\geq 1$, lower bounds the norm $\\|f\\|_p$ by a $1/\\alpha$-fraction of\nthe $L_p$ mass of the stream had all updates been positive. Here, for a vector\n$f$, $\\|f\\|_p = \\left (\\sum_{i=1}^n |f_i|^p \\right )^{1/p}$, and the value of\n$p$ we choose depends on the application. This gives a fluid medium between\ninsertion only streams (with $\\alpha = 1$), and turnstile streams (with $\\alpha\n= \\text{poly}(n)$), and allows for analysis in terms of $\\alpha$.\n  We show that for streams with this $\\alpha$-property, for many fundamental\nstreaming problems we can replace a $O(\\log(n))$ factor in the space usage for\nalgorithms in the turnstile model with a $O(\\log(\\alpha))$ factor.

Often, they can be given a causal\ninterpretation in the sense that they not only model the evolution of the\nstates of the system's components over time, but also describe how their\nevolution is affected by external interventions on the system that perturb the\ndynamics. We introduce the formal framework of structural dynamical causal\nmodels (SDCMs) that explicates the causal semantics of the system's components\nas part of the model. SDCMs represent a dynamical system as a collection of\nstochastic processes and specify the basic causal mechanisms that govern the\ndynamics of each component as a structured system of random differential\nequations of arbitrary order. SDCMs extend the versatile causal modeling\nframework of structural causal models (SCMs), also known as structural equation\nmodels (SEMs), by explicitly allowing for time-dependence. An SDCM can be\nthought of as the stochastic-process version of an SCM, where the static random\nvariables of the SCM are replaced by dynamic stochastic processes and their\nderivatives. We provide the foundations for a theory of SDCMs, by (i) formally\ndefining SDCMs, their solutions, stochastic interventions, and a graphical\nrepresentation; (ii) studying existence and uniqueness of the solutions for\ngiven initial conditions; (iii) providing Markov properties for SDCMs with\ninitial conditions; (iv) discussing under which conditions SDCMs equilibrate to\nSCMs as time tends to infinity; (v) relating the properties of the SDCM to\nthose of the equilibrium SCM. This correspondence enables one to leverage the\nwealth of statistical tools and discovery methods available for SCMs when\nstudying the causal semantics of a large class of stochastic dynamical systems.\nThe theory is illustrated with examples from different scientific domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 13:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 09:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 14:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2022 20:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

However, in spite of having a\npositive impact on performance, the use of context in these kernel design\nmethods has not been fully explored; indeed, context has been handcrafted\ninstead of being learned.

A prominent example is functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a noisy measurement of a delayed\nsignal that depends non-linearly on the neuronal activity through the\nneurovascular coupling. These characteristics make the inference of neuronal\nactivity from fMRI a difficult but important step in fMRI studies that require\ninformation at the neuronal level. In this article, we address this inference\nproblem using a Bayesian approach where we model the latent neural activity as\na stochastic process and assume that the observed BOLD signal results from a\nrealistic physiological (Balloon) model. We apply a recently developed\nsmoothing method called APIS to efficiently sample the posterior given single\nevent fMRI time series. To infer neuronal signals with high likelihood for\nmultiple time series efficiently, a modification of the original algorithm is\nintroduced. We demonstrate that our adaptive procedure is able to compensate\nthe lacking of inputs in the model to infer the neuronal activity and that it\noutperforms dramatically the standard bootstrap particle filter-smoother in\nthis setting. This makes the proposed procedure especially attractive to\ndeconvolve resting state fMRI data. To validate the method, we evaluate the\nquality of the signals inferred using the timing information contained in them.\nAPIS obtains reliable event timing estimates based on fMRI data gathered during\na reaction time experiment with short stimuli. Hence, we show for the first\ntime that one can obtain accurate absolute timing of neuronal activity by\nreconstructing the latent neural signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 14:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

The design of pCLE\nhardware, and its reliance on an optical fibre bundle, fundamentally limits the\nimage quality with a few tens of thousands fibres, each acting as the\nequivalent of a single-pixel detector, assembled into a single fibre bundle.\nVideo-registration techniques can be used to estimate high-resolution (HR)\nimages by exploiting the temporal information contained in a sequence of\nlow-resolution (LR) images. However, the alignment of LR frames, required for\nthe fusion, is computationally demanding and prone to artefacts. Methods: In\nthis work, we propose a novel synthetic data generation approach to train\nexemplar-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). HR pCLE images with enhanced\nquality are recovered by the models trained on pairs of estimated HR images\n(generated by the video-registration algorithm) and realistic synthetic LR\nimages. Performance of three different state-of-the-art DNNs techniques were\nanalysed on a Smart Atlas database of 8806 images from 238 pCLE video\nsequences. The results were validated through an extensive Image Quality\nAssessment (IQA) that takes into account different quality scores, including a\nMean Opinion Score (MOS). Results: Results indicate that the proposed solution\nproduces an effective improvement in the quality of the obtained reconstructed\nimage. Conclusion: The proposed training strategy and associated DNNs allows us\nto perform convincing super-resolution of pCLE images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

We quantify for the first time the amount of SZ cluster\ncontamination in the released Planck 2015 CMB maps through (i) the stacking of\nCMB maps in the direction of the clusters, and (ii) the computation of\ncross-correlation power spectra between CMB maps and the SDSS-IV large-scale\nstructure data.

For a given dynamical system in a certain region of phase\nspace with transient chaos, trajectories eventually abandon the chaotic region\nescaping to an external attractor, if no external intervention is done on the\nsystem. In some situations, this attractor may involve an undesirable behavior,\nso the application of a control in the system is necessary to avoid it. Both,\nthe nonattractive nature of transient chaos and eventually the presence of\nnoise may hinder this task. Recently, a new method to control chaos called\n\\emph{partial control} has been developed. The method is based on the existence\nof a set, called the safe set, that allows to sustain transient chaos by only\nusing a small amount of control. The surprising result is that the trajectories\ncan be controlled by using an amount of control smaller than the amount of\nnoise affecting it. We present here a broad survey of results of this control\nmethod applied to a wide variety of dynamical systems. We also review here all\nthe variations of the partial control method that have been developed so far.\nIn all the cases various systems of different dimensionality are treated in\norder to see the potential of this method.

We use\nhydrodynamic-like economic equations and derive from them the system of\nordinary differential equations that describe business cycle fluctuations of\nmacro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics. The\nnature of business cycle fluctuations is explained as oscillations of \"mean\nrisk\" of economic variables on bounded economic domain of economic space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 12:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

However, studies on soft actuators based on\nbilayer doming remain largely unexplored despite the often-observed dome-like\nshapes in undersea animals such as jellyfish and octopus suction cup. Here,\nbased on the simplified model of bending-induced doming of circular bilayer\nplates with mismatched deformation, we explore the design of soft doming\nactuator upon pneumatic actuation and its implications in design of\nmultifunctional soft machines. The bilayer actuator is composed of patterned\nembedded pneumatic channel on top for radial expansion and a solid elastomeric\nlayer on bottom for strain-limiting. We show that both the cavity volume and\nbending angle at the rim of the actuated dome can be controlled by tuning the\nheight gradient of the pneumatic channel along the radial direction. We\ndemonstrate its potential multifunctional applications in swimming, adhesion,\nand gripping, including high efficient jellyfish-inspired underwater soft\nrobots with locomotion speed of 84 cm/min and rotation-based soft grippers with\nlow energy cost by harnessing the large rim bending angle, as well as\noctopus-inspired soft adhesion actuators with strong and switchable adhesion\nforce of over 10 N by utilizing the large cavity volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 01:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Here, we propose a\nnew design of pneumatic-actuated bioinspired soft adhesion actuator working\nboth on ground and under water. It is composed of extremely soft bilayer\nstructures with an embedded spiral pneumatic channel resting on top of a base\nlayer with a cavity. Rather than the traditional way of directly pumping air\nout of the cavity for suction in hard polymer-based adhesion actuator, we\ninflate air into the top spiral channel to deform into a stable 3D domed shape\nfor achieving negative pressure in the cavity. The characterization of the\nmaximum shear adhesion force of the proposed soft adhesion actuator shows\nstrong and rapid reversible adhesion on multiple types of smooth and\nsemi-smooth surfaces. Based on the switchable adhesion actuator, we design and\nfabricate a novel load-carrying amphibious climbing soft robot (ACSR) by\ncombining with a soft bending actuator. We demonstrate that it can operate on a\nwide range of foreign horizontal and vertical surfaces including dry, wet,\nslippery, smooth, and semi-smooth ones on ground and also under water with\ncertain load-carrying capability. We show that the vertical climbing speed can\nreach about 286 mm/min (1.6 body length/min) while carrying over 200g object\n(over 5 times the weight of ACSR itself) during climbing on ground and under\nwater. This research could largely push the boundaries of soft robot\ncapabilities and multifunctionality in window cleaning and underwater\ninspection under harsh environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 01:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 22:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}
