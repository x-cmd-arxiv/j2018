Such a scenario\ndescribes photonic many-body systems such as exciton-polariton gases. Our\nanalysis is based on a set of kinetic equations for a gas of noninteracting\nbosons. By identifying a dimensionless scaling parameter controlling the boson\ndensity, we derive a sharp criterion for which system states become selected to\nhost a macroscopic occupation. We show that with increasing pump power, the\nsystem generically undergoes a sequence of nonequilibrum phase transitions. At\neach transition a state either becomes or ceases to be Bose selected (i.e. to\nhost a condensate): The state which first acquires a condensate when the\npumping exceeds a threshold is the one with the largest ratio of pumping to\nloss. This intuitive behavior resembles simple lasing. In the limit of strong\npumping, the coupling to the heat bath becomes dominant so that eventually the\nground state is selected, corresponding to equilibrium(-like) Bose\ncondensation. For intermediate pumping strengths, several states become\nselected giving rise to fragmented nonequilibrium Bose condensation. We compare\nthese predictions to experimental results obtained for excitons polaritons in a\ndouble-pillar structure [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 126403 (2012)] and find good\nagreement.

Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been applied to\ngeneralize social dilemma problems to temporally and spatially extended Markov\ngames. However, this has not yet generated an agent that learns to cooperate in\nsocial dilemmas as humans do. A key insight is that many, but not all, human\nindividuals have inequity averse social preferences. This promotes a particular\nresolution of the matrix game social dilemma wherein inequity-averse\nindividuals are personally pro-social and punish defectors. Here we extend this\nidea to Markov games and show that it promotes cooperation in several types of\nsequential social dilemma, via a profitable interaction with policy\nlearnability.

Current state-of-the-art\nsystems attempted to solve the task using deep neural architectures and\nachieved promising performance. However, the resulting systems are generally\nopaque and they struggle in understanding questions for which extra knowledge\nis required. In this paper, we present an explicit reasoning layer on top of a\nset of penultimate neural network based systems. The reasoning layer enables\nreasoning and answering questions where additional knowledge is required, and\nat the same time provides an interpretable interface to the end users.\nSpecifically, the reasoning layer adopts a Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) based\nengine to reason over a basket of inputs: visual relations, the semantic parse\nof the question, and background ontological knowledge from word2vec and\nConceptNet. Experimental analysis of the answers and the key evidential\npredicates generated on the VQA dataset validate our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 17:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-26"}

Under the constraint that\ncirculations around cloud edge compete for buoyant energy and air, we show that\nthe product of cloud number and cloud perimeter $n\\lambda$ is invariant with\n$\\lambda$ and that cloud number follows a negative exponential with respect to\ncloud-edge deviations of $h^\\star$ from the mean. Overall, the summed perimeter\nof all clouds scales as the square root of the atmospheric static stability,\nwhich suggests that the complexity of cloud field structures can be viewed\nstatistically as an emergent property of atmospheric bulk thermodynamics.\nAnalytically derived conclusions are compared with a detailed tropical cloud\nfield simulation and found generally to agree to within $<$13%. For the sake of\ndeveloping hypotheses about cloud temporal evolution that are testable in high\nresolution simulations, the shapes of tropical cloud perimeter distributions\nare predicted to be invariant as climate warms, although with a modest increase\nin total cloud amount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 17:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 23:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Under\nnormal conditions, heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms critically prohibit the\nsimultaneous long-term (> 1 week), large volume (> 1 ml) and low temperatures\n(< -10 oC) supercooling of aqueous solutions. Here, in order to overcome this\nbottleneck and enable novel and practical supercooling applications, we report\non the use of surface sealing of water by an oil phase to drastically diminish\nthe primary heterogeneous nucleation at the water/air interface. Using this\napproach, we have achieved deep supercooling (as low as -20 oC) of\nlarge-volumes of water (up to 100 ml) for long periods (as long as 100 days)\nsimultaneously. Since oils are mixtures of various hydrocarbons we also report\non the use of pure alkanes and primary alcohols of various lengths to achieve\nthe same. All alcohols and some of the longer alkane chains we studied show\nhigh capacity to inhibit freezing. The relationship of this capacity with the\nchain length, however, shows opposite trends for alcohols and alkanes due to\ntheir drastically different interfacial structures with the water molecules. We\nfind that the deeply supercooled water (at -20 oC) can withstand vibrational\nand thermal disturbances with all sealing liquids used, and even an extreme\ndisturbance, ultrasonication, when alcohols are used as the sealing phase. The\ndeep supercooling approach we developed here, for large samples and long\nperiods, is expected to enable novel applications of supercooling in a variety\nof areas including biopreservation and food storage among others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 17:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

It\nis crucial that the model considers a parabolic trapping potential to resemble\nthe experimental conditions. Thus, we detail here how the formal derivation\nchanges due to the gas trap, in comparison to the homogeneous gas. We first\nfind that the presence of a gas trap leads to a new form of the bath-impurity\ncoupling constant and a larger degree in the super-ohmicity of the spectral\ndensity. This is manifested as a different dependence of the system dynamics on\nthe past history. To quantify this, we introduce several techniques to compare\nthe different amount of memory effects arising in the homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous gas. We find that it is higher in the second case. Moreover, we\ncalculate the position variance of the impurity, represenitng a measurable\nquantity. We show that the impurity experiences super-diffusion and genuine\nposition squeezing. Wdetail how both effects can be enhanced or inhibited by\ntuning the Bose-Einstein condensate trap frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 19:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 14:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

The objective is to observe physical sensor data from CCTV cameras,\nand social media data from Twitter and Instagram to detect anomalous behaviors\nor events. Data from each modality is transformed to discrete time count data\nby using an artificial neural network to obtain counts of objects in CCTV\nimages and by counting the number of tweets or Instagram posts in a\ngeographical area. The anomaly detection problem is then formulated as a\nproblem of quickest detection of changes in count statistics. The quickest\ndetection problem is then solved using the framework of partially observable\nMarkov decision processes (POMDP), and structural results on the optimal policy\nare obtained. The resulting optimal policy is then applied to real multimodal\ndata collected from New York City around a 5K race to detect the race. The\ncount data both before and after the change is found to be nonstationary in\nnature. The proposed mathematical approach to this problem provides a framework\nfor event detection in such nonstationary environments and across multiple data\nmodalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 19:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

These waves are most likely a combination of resonantly coupled fast\nmagnetoacoustic waves and Alfv\\'en waves. The coupling results in resonant\nabsorption of the fast waves, converting fast wave energy into Alfv\\'en waves.\nThe fast eigenmodes of the arcade have proven difficult to compute or derive\nanalytically, largely because of the mathematical complexity that the coupling\nintroduces. When a traditional spectral decomposition is employed, the discrete\nspectrum associated with the fast eigenmodes is often subsumed into the\ncontinuous Alfv\\'en spectrum. Thus fast eigenmodes, become collective modes or\nquasi-modes. Here we present a spectral decomposition that treats the\neigenmodes as having real frequencies but complex wavenumbers. Using this\nprocedure we derive dispersion relations, spatial damping rates, and\neigenfunctions for the resonant, fast eigenmodes of the arcade. We demonstrate\nthat resonant absorption introduces a fast mode that would not exist otherwise.\nThis new mode is heavily damped by resonant absorption, only travelling a few\nwavelengths before losing most of its energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 19:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

(c) At large\n$d$, we find a Bilayer Graphene (BG) crystal in which the A and B sites of the\ngraphene lattice lie in different layers. All crystals that we predict are\nstrongly correlated crystals of composite fermions; a theory incorporating only\nelectron Hartree-Fock crystals does not find any crystals besides the `trivial'\nones occurring at large interlayer separations for total filling factor\n$\\nu\\leq1/3$ (when layers are uncorrelated and each layer is in the long\nfamiliar single-layer crystal phase). The TIAF, CS and BG crystals come in\nseveral varieties, with different flavors of composite fermions and different\ninterlayer correlations. The appearance of these exotic crystal phases adds to\nthe richness of the physics of electron bilayers in a strong magnetic field,\nand also provides insight into experimentally observed bilayer insulator as\nwell as transitions within the insulating part of the phase diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 20:14:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 00:26:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 03:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Systems-level engineering tools for\npolarimetric instrumentation require accurate predictions of fringe amplitudes,\nperiods for transmission, diattenuation and retardance. The relevant\ninstabilities caused by environmental, thermal and optical properties can be\nmodeled and mitigation tools developed.

Prior work has leveraged the sparse nature of mmWave\nchannels via compressed sensing based algorithms for channel estimation. Most\nof these algorithms, though, assume perfect synchronization and are vulnerable\nto phase errors that arise due to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase\nnoise. Recently sparsity-aware, non-coherent beamforming algorithms that are\nrobust to phase errors were proposed for narrowband phased array systems with\nfull resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Such energy based\nalgorithms, however, are not robust to heavy quantization at the receiver. In\nthis paper, we develop a joint CFO and wideband channel estimation algorithm\nthat is scalable across different mmWave architectures. Our method exploits the\nsparsity of mmWave MIMO channel in the angle-delay domain, in addition to\ncompressibility of the phase error vector. We formulate the joint estimation as\na sparse bilinear optimization problem and then use message passing for\nrecovery. We also give an efficient implementation of a generalized bilinear\nmessage passing algorithm for the joint estimation in mmWave systems with\none-bit ADCs.

A Gaussian prior of the variance is assumed across all\nsubjects and the variance from regular ones are transferred to the\nunder-represented ones.

Yet we\nbelieve it is possible to leverage the specific aspects of unmanned aviation to\nmeet acceptable safety requirements. We start this paper with by discussing the\nnew operational context of civilian UAVs and investigate the meaning of safety\nin light of this new context. Next, we explore the different approaches to\nensuring system safety from an avionics point of view. Subsets of operational\nrequirements such as geofencing or mechanical systems for termination or impact\nlimitation can easily be implemented. These are presented with the goal of\nlimiting the collateral damages of a system failure. We then present some\nexperimental results regarding two of the major problems with UAVs. With actual\nimpacts, we demonstrate how dangerous uncontrolled crashes can be. Furthermore,\nwith the large number of runaway drone experiences during civilian operations,\nthe risk is even higher as they can travel a long way before crashing. We\nprovide data on such a case where the software controller is working, keeping\nthe UAV in the air, but the operator is unable to actually control the system.\nIt should be terminated! Finally, after having analyzed the context and some\nactual solutions, based on a minimal set of requirement and our own experience,\nwe are proposing a simple mechanical based safety system.

Well tuned cavities assure the good field stability\nand require a minimum level of RF power to reach the operating gradient level.\nThe TESLA cavities at XFEL accelerator are tuned using slow (step motors) and\nfast (piezo) tuners driven by the control system. The goal of this control\nsystem is to keep the detuning of the cavity as close to zero as possible even\nin the presence of disturbing effects (LFD - Lorentz Force Detuning and\nmicrophonics). The step motor tuners are used to coarse cavity tuning while\npiezo actuators are used to fine-tuning and disturbance compensation. The\ncrucial part of the piezo control system is the piezo driver. To compensate LFD\nthe piezo driving with relatively high voltage (up to 100V) and high current\n(up to 1A) is needed. Since the piezo components are susceptible to destruction\nwith overvoltage, overcurrent, and also overtemperature, one has to pay special\nattention to keep the piezos healthy. What makes things worse and more\ncritical, is that the piezo exchange is not possible after the module is\nassembled. Therefore the special hardware must be assisting the power\namplifier, detecting the dangerous conditions and disabling piezo operation\nwhen needed. It must be fail-safe, so even in a case of failure the piezos\nshall survive. It must be also robust and it must not disturb or disable normal\noperation.

Since most of the state-of-the-art\nsteganalytic methods employ a machine learning (ML) based classifier, it is\nreasonable to consider countering steganalysis by trying to fool the ML\nclassifiers. However, simply applying perturbations on stego images as\nadversarial examples may lead to the failure of data extraction and introduce\nunexpected artefacts detectable by other classifiers. In this paper, we present\na steganographic scheme with a novel operation called adversarial embedding,\nwhich achieves the goal of hiding a stego message while at the same time\nfooling a convolutional neural network (CNN) based steganalyzer. The proposed\nmethod works under the conventional framework of distortion minimization.\nAdversarial embedding is achieved by adjusting the costs of image element\nmodifications according to the gradients backpropagated from the CNN classifier\ntargeted by the attack. Therefore, modification direction has a higher\nprobability to be the same as the sign of the gradient. In this way, the so\ncalled adversarial stego images are generated. Experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed steganographic scheme is secure against the targeted adversary-unaware\nsteganalyzer. In addition, it deteriorates the performance of other\nadversary-aware steganalyzers opening the way to a new class of modern\nsteganographic schemes capable to overcome powerful CNN-based steganalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2018 02:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

The\nstandard \"twist-and-shift\" formulation of the boundary conditions [Beer,\nCowley, Hammett \\textit{Phys.

Within the constructed frame, the asymptotic joint law of any finite\nnumber of other statistics is automatically given as well as the joint\ndistribution of its spatial variation or temporal variation, in absolute or\nrelative values. We also deal with the general problem of decomposability of\nstatistics by comparing statistical decomposability, a new view we introduce,\nversus functional decomposability. A general result only based on the GRI is\nprovided. \\noindent This monograph is also the portal of a handbook of GRI that\nwill cover the largest number possible of statistics. In prevision of that, we\ntreat three important examples as show cases. It is expected that this portal\nand the handbook will attract the attention of researchers working in the\nasymptotic area and will furnish useful tools to scientists who are interested\nin application of asymptotic tests, completed by computer packages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2018 05:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Coil 1 is driven by active source, where\ncoil 2 is driven by the magnetic field coupled from coil 1.

We also provide new evidence about the effectiveness of\nneural network approaches by decoupling the model architecture from the feature\ndesign of a state-of-the-art neural network system. Surprisingly, a much\nsimpler classifier trained on similar features performs on par with the highly\ncomplex neural network system (at 75x reduction to the training time),\nsuggesting that the features are a bigger contributor to the final performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2018 10:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Current approaches\nbased on supervised learning require large amounts of annotated data, whose\nscarce availability is one of the main limiting factors to the development of\ngeneral solutions. Unsupervised learning can instead leverage the vast amount\nof videos available on the web and it is a promising solution for overcoming\nthe existing limitations. In this paper, we propose an adversarial GAN-based\nframework that learns video representations and dynamics through a\nself-supervision mechanism in order to perform dense and global prediction in\nvideos. Our approach synthesizes videos by 1) factorizing the process into the\ngeneration of static visual content and motion, 2) learning a suitable\nrepresentation of a motion latent space in order to enforce spatio-temporal\ncoherency of object trajectories, and 3) incorporating motion estimation and\npixel-wise dense prediction into the training procedure. Self-supervision is\nenforced by using motion masks produced by the generator, as a co-product of\nits generation process, to supervise the discriminator network in performing\ndense prediction. Performance evaluation, carried out on standard benchmarks,\nshows that our approach is able to learn, in an unsupervised way, both local\nand global video dynamics. The learned representations, then, support the\ntraining of video object segmentation methods with sensibly less (about 50%)\nannotations, giving performance comparable to the state of the art.\nFurthermore, the proposed method achieves promising performance in generating\nrealistic videos, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches especially on\nmotion-related metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2018 11:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 20:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

As\na result, the number of devices accessing the Internet through WLANs such as\nlaptops, smartphones, or wearables, is increasing drastically at the same time\nthat applications' throughput requirements do. To cope with these challenges,\nchannel bonding (CB) techniques are used for enabling higher data rates by\ntransmitting in wider channels, thus increasing spectrum efficiency. However,\nimportant issues like higher potential co-channel and adjacent channel\ninterference arise when bonding channels. This may harm the performance of the\ncarrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol because of recurrent backoff\nfreezing while making nodes more sensitive to hidden node effects. In this\npaper, we address the following point at issue: is it convenient for\nhigh-density (HD) WLANs to use wider channels and potentially overlap in the\nspectrum? First, we highlight key aspects of DCB in toy scenarios through a\ncontinuous time Markov network (CTMN) model. Then, by means of extensive\nsimulations covering a wide range of traffic loads and access point (AP)\ndensities, we show that dynamic channel bonding (DCB) - which adapts the\nchannel bandwidth on a per-packet transmission - significantly outperforms\ntraditional single-channel on average. Nevertheless, results also corroborate\nthat DCB is more prone to generate unfair situations where WLANs may starve.\nContrary to most of the current thoughts pushing towards non-overlapping\nchannels in HD deployments, we highlight the benefits of allocating channels as\nwider as possible to WLANs altogether with implementing adaptive access\npolicies to cope with the unfairness situations that may appear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2018 13:49:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 14:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 09:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 00:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

When datasets for Bayesian inference are small, a principle\nchallenge is that, as additional data are collected, the probability measure\ninferred from Bayesian inference may change significantly. That is, the\noriginal probability density inferred from Bayesian inference may differ\nconsiderably from the updated probability density both in its model form and\nparameters. In such cases, expensive Monte Carlo simulations may have already\nbeen performed using the original distribution and it is infeasible to start\nagain and perform a new Monte Carlo analysis using the updated density due to\nthe large added computational cost. In this work, we discuss four strategies\nfor updating Mote Carlo simulations for such a change in probability measure:\n1. Importance sampling reweighting; 2. A sample augmenting strategy; 3. A\nsample filtering strategy; and 4. A mixed augmenting-filtering strategy. The\nefficiency of each strategy is compared and the ultimate aim is to achieve the\nchange in distribution with a minimal number of added computational\nsimulations. The comparison results show that when the change in measure is\nsmall importance sampling reweighting can be very effective. Otherwise, a\nproposed novel mixed augmenting-filtering algorithm can robustly and\nefficiently accommodate a measure change in Monte Carlo simulation that\nminimizes the impact on the sample set and saves a large amount of additional\ncomputational cost.

Expansion\nof the PWN is apparent across the four epochs, 2000, 2006, 2009, and 2016. We\nfind an expansion rate between 2000 and 2016 of the NW edge of the PWN of\n0.249% +/- 0.023% yr^{-1}, for an expansion age R/(dR/dt) of 400 +/- 40 years\nand an expansion velocity of about 1000 km s^{-1}. We suggest that the PWN is\nexpanding into an asymmetric nickel bubble in a conventional Type IIP\nsupernova. Some acceleration of the PWN expansion is likely, giving a true age\nof 480 +/- 50 years. The pulsar's birth luminosity was larger than the current\nvalue by a factor of 3 -- 8, while the initial period was within a factor of 2\nof its current value. We confirm directly that Kes 75 contains the youngest\nknown PWN, and hence youngest known pulsar. The pulsar PSR J1846-0258 has a\nspindown-inferred magnetic field of 5 x 10^{13} G; in 2006 it emitted five\nmagnetar-like short X-ray bursts, but its spindown luminosity has not changed\nsignificantly. However, the flux of the PWN has decreased by about 10% between\n2009 and 2016, almost entirely in the northern half. A bright knot has declined\nby 30% since 2006. During this time, the photon indices of the power-law models\ndid not change. This flux change is too rapid to be due to normal PWN evolution\nin one-zone models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2018 15:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Of interest is the need to allow someone to monitor\ntravel momentum and associated congestion in any location in space in real\ntime. However, despite an abundant literature in taxi data visualization and\nits applicability to travel analysis, no easy method exists. To measure taxi\ntravel momentum at a location, current methods require filtering taxi\ntrajectories that stop at a location at a particular time range, which is\ncomputationally expensive. We propose an alternative, computationally cheaper\nway based on pre-processing vector fields from the trajectories. Algorithms are\nformalized for generating vector kernel density to estimate a travel-model-free\nvector field-based representation of travel momentum in an urban space. The\nalgorithms are shared online as an open source GIS 3D extension called\nVectorKD. Using 17 million daily taxi GPS points within Beijing over a four-day\nperiod, we demonstrate how to generate in real time a series of projections\nfrom a continuously updated vector field of taxi travel momentum to query a\npoint of interest anywhere in a city, such as the CBD or the airport. This\nmethod allows a policy-maker to automatically identify temporal net influxes of\ntravel demand to a location. The proposed methodology is shown to be over\ntwenty times faster than a conventional selection query of trajectories. We\nalso demonstrate, using taxi data entering the Beijing Capital International\nAirport and the CBD, how we can quantify in nearly real time the occurrence and\nmagnitude of inbound or outbound queueing and congestion periods due to taxis\ncruising or waiting for passengers, all without having to fit any mathematical\nqueueing model to the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2018 14:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 15:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Part of the challenge in\nstudying chatter is that machining equations that describe its occurrence are\noften nonlinear delay differential equations. The majority of the available\ntools for chatter identification rely on defining a metric that captures the\ncharacteristics of chatter, and a threshold that signals its occurrence. The\ndifficulty in choosing these parameters can be somewhat alleviated by utilizing\nmachine learning techniques. However, even with a successful classification\nalgorithm, the transferability of typical machine learning methods from one\ndata set to another remains very limited. In this paper we combine supervised\nmachine learning with Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to obtain a descriptor of\nthe process which can detect chatter. The features we use are derived from the\npersistence diagram of an attractor reconstructed from the time series via\nTakens embedding. We test the approach using deterministic and stochastic\nturning models, where the stochasticity is introduced via the cutting\ncoefficient term. Our results show a 97% successful classification rate on the\ndeterministic model labeled by the stability diagram obtained using the\nspectral element method. The features gleaned from the deterministic model are\nthen utilized for characterization of chatter in a stochastic turning model\nwhere there are very limited analysis methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 18:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}
