MLFN is composed of multiple stacked blocks. Each block\ncontains multiple factor modules to model latent factors at a specific level,\nand factor selection modules that dynamically select the factor modules to\ninterpret the content of each input image. The outputs of the factor selection\nmodules also provide a compact latent factor descriptor that is complementary\nto the conventional deeply learned features.

The physical underpinning of the key parameter in this\nframework, eddy diffusivity $K_{zz}$, is usually obscure. Here we analytically\nand numerically investigate vertical tracer transport in a 3D stratified\natmosphere and predict $K_{zz}$ as a function of the large-scale circulation\nstrength, horizontal mixing due to eddies and waves and local tracer sources\nand sinks. We find that $K_{zz}$ increases with tracer chemical lifetime and\ncirculation strength but decreases with horizontal eddy mixing efficiency. We\ndemarcated three $K_{zz}$ regimes in planetary atmospheres. In the first regime\nwhere the tracer lifetime is short compared with the transport timescale and\nhorizontal tracer distribution under chemical equilibrium ($\\chi_0$) is\nuniformly distributed across the globe, global-mean vertical tracer mixing\nbehaves diffusively. But the traditional assumption in current 1D models that\nall chemical species are transported via the same eddy diffusivity generally\nbreaks down. We show that different chemical species in a single atmosphere\nshould in principle have different eddy diffusion profiles. In the second\nregime where tracer is short-lived but $\\chi_0$ is non-uniformly distributed, a\nsignificant non-diffusive component might lead to a negative $K_{zz}$ under the\ndiffusive assumption. In the third regime where the tracer is long-lived,\nglobal-mean vertical tracer transport is also largely influenced by\nnon-diffusive effects.

However, most concept drift handling techniques,\napproach it as a domain independent task, to make them applicable to a wide\ngamut of reactive systems. These techniques were developed from an adversarial\nagnostic perspective, where they are naive and assume that drift is a benign\nchange, which can be fixed by updating the model. However, this is not the case\nwhen an active adversary is trying to evade the deployed classification system.\nIn such an environment, the properties of concept drift are unique, as the\ndrift is intended to degrade the system and at the same time designed to avoid\ndetection by traditional concept drift detection techniques. This special\ncategory of drift is termed as adversarial drift, and this paper analyzes its\ncharacteristics and impact, in a streaming environment. A novel framework for\ndealing with adversarial concept drift is proposed, called the Predict-Detect\nstreaming framework. Experimental evaluation of the framework, on generated\nadversarial drifting data streams, demonstrates that this framework is able to\nprovide reliable unsupervised indication of drift, and is able to recover from\ndrifts swiftly. While traditional partially labeled concept drift detection\nmethodologies fail to detect adversarial drifts, the proposed framework is able\nto detect such drifts and operates with <6% labeled data, on average.

While most\nworks in the security of machine learning has concentrated on the evasion\nresistance (a) problem, there is little work in the areas of reacting to\nattacks (b and c).

Magnetic resonance (MR) images provide sufficient\nimaging contrast to visualize and detect lesions, particularly those in the\nwhite matter. Quantitative measures based on various features of lesions have\nbeen shown to be useful in clinical trials for evaluating therapies. Therefore\nrobust and accurate segmentation of white matter lesions from MR images can\nprovide important information about the disease status and progression. In this\npaper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to\nsegment white matter lesions from multi-contrast MR images. The proposed CNN\nbased method contains two convolutional pathways. The first pathway consists of\nmultiple parallel convolutional filter banks catering to multiple MR\nmodalities. In the second pathway, the outputs of the first one are\nconcatenated and another set of convolutional filters are applied. The output\nof this last pathway produces a membership function for lesions that may be\nthresholded to obtain a binary segmentation. The proposed method is evaluated\non a dataset of 100 MS patients, as well as the ISBI 2015 challenge data\nconsisting of 14 patients. The comparison is performed against four publicly\navailable MS lesion segmentation methods. Significant improvement in\nsegmentation quality over the competing methods is demonstrated on various\nmetrics, such as Dice and false positive ratio.

We show that the core decomposition is independent of the\nembedding of K into the plane. Given a rational function f with degree at least\n2 that is independent of K. A well known result by Beardon says that the\npre-image for any element d of the core decomposition has finitely many\ncomponents, each of which is mapped by f onto d.

Extending the automated mode to ramp merging zones presents substantial\nchallenges. One is that the automated vehicle needs to incorporate a future\nobjective (e.g. a successful and smooth merge) and optimize a long-term reward\nthat is impacted by subsequent actions when executing the current action.\nFurthermore, the merging process involves interaction between the merging\nvehicle and its surrounding vehicles whose behavior may be cooperative or\nadversarial, leading to distinct merging countermeasures that are crucial to\nsuccessfully complete the merge. In place of the conventional rule-based\napproaches, we propose to apply reinforcement learning algorithm on the\nautomated vehicle agent to find an optimal driving policy by maximizing the\nlong-term reward in an interactive driving environment. Most importantly, in\ncontrast to most reinforcement learning applications in which the action space\nis resolved as discrete, our approach treats the action space as well as the\nstate space as continuous without incurring additional computational costs. Our\nunique contribution is the design of the Q-function approximation whose format\nis structured as a quadratic function, by which simple but effective neural\nnetworks are used to estimate its coefficients. The results obtained through\nthe implementation of our training platform demonstrate that the vehicle agent\nis able to learn a safe, smooth and timely merging policy, indicating the\neffectiveness and practicality of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 05:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Thus, it is of practical interest to employ\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to improve the throughput of all network\nusers, while fulfilling the energy harvesting requirements of the near-by\nusers. To realize both energy harvesting and information decoding, we consider\na transmit time-switching (transmit-TS) protocol.

A simple analyze shows that this\ninteraction between the hydrogen momentum and the electron is of order of\n$\\alpha^3\\frac{v}{c}m$, where $\\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $v$ is\nthe atom velocity, $c$ is the speed of light, and $m$ is the electron mass.\nUsing the Bethe-Salpeter equation, the two velocity-dependent operators of this\norder are derived for the hydrogen velocity $\\frac{v}{c}<<\\alpha$. As well\nknown, the degeneracy of the energy levels with the same principal quantum\nnumber, $n$, and the same quantum number of the total angular momentum, $j$,\nbut the different orbital angular momenta $l=j\\pm 1/2$ is removed by the\nradiative corrections (the Lamb shift) that are proportional to $\\alpha^{5}m$.\nIt is shown that the velocity-dependent perturbation interactions remove this\ndegeneracy as well. There is, however, an important difference between the Lamb\nshifts and the energy-levels shifts induced by the atom motion. The Lamb shift\nis the diagonal correction to the energy separately for each of the degenerate\nstates. The the velocity-dependent perturbation interactions result in the\noff-diagonal energy corrections between the mutually degenerate states. The\njoint effect of these two perturbations which are essentially different in\ntheir origin, is analyzed. Given their order of magnitude, the crossover from\nthe Lamb shifts to the motion-induced shifts should occur at the atom velocity\n$v=k\\alpha^2 c$, where $k>>1$ is a numerical factor depended on $n$ and $j$.

To achieve this, we propose a novel method,\nFeature Refine Net (FRN), and a cascaded multi-scale architecture. FRN exploits\nthe multi-scale hierarchical features created by deep convolutional neural\nnetworks. The proposed channel weighting method enables FRN to make use of\nfeatures alternatively and effectively. To improve the performance of small\nhead detection, we propose a cascaded multi-scale architecture which has two\ndetectors. One called global detector is responsible for detecting large\nobjects and acquiring the global distribution information. The other called\nlocal detector is designed for small objects detection and makes use of the\ninformation provided by global detector. Due to the lack of head detection\ndatasets, we have collected and labeled a new large dataset named SCUT-HEAD\nwhich includes 4405 images with 111251 heads annotated.

Before such a container may enter a trade bloc, the customs agency of the\ngoods' destination country must ensure that it does not contain illegal or\nmislabeled goods. Due to the high volume of containers, customs agencies make a\nselection of containers to audit through a risk analysis procedure. Customs\nagencies perform risk analysis using data sourced from a centralized system\nthat is potentially vulnerable to manipulation and malpractice. Therefore we\npropose an alternative: DEFenD, a decentralized system that stores data about\ngoods and containers in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. In our system,\neconomic operators make claims to the network about goods they insert into or\nremove from containers, and encrypt these claims so that they can only be read\nby the destination country's customs agency. Economic operators also make\nunencrypted claims about containers with which they interact. Unencrypted\nclaims can be validated by the entire network of customs agencies. Our key\ncontribution is a data partitioning scheme and several protocols that enable\nsuch a system to utilize blockchain and its powerful validation principle,\nwhile also preserving the privacy of the involved economic operators. Using our\nprotocol, customs agencies can improve their risk analysis and economic\noperators can get through customs with less delay.

The main\ncomputational cost of the AIRGA algorithm is solving a sequence of linear\nsystems. Usually, direct methods (e.g., LU) are used for solving these systems.\nAs model sizes grow, direct methods become prohibitively expensive. Iterative\nmethods (e.g., Krylov) scale well with size, and hence, are a good choice with\nan appropriate preconditioner.\n  Preconditioned iterative methods introduce errors in linear solves because\nthey are not exact. They solve linear systems up to a certain tolerance. We\nprove that, under mild conditions, the AIRGA algorithm is backward stable with\nrespect to the errors introduced by these inexact linear solves. Our first\nassumption is use of a Ritz-Galerkin based solver that satisfies few extra\northogonality conditions. Since Conjugate Gradient (CG) is the most popular\nmethod based upon the Ritz-Galerkin theory, we use it. We show how to modify CG\nto achieve these extra orthogonalities.\n  Modifying CG with the suggested changes is non-trivial. Hence, we demonstrate\nthat using Recycling CG (RCG) helps us achieve these orthogonalities with no\ncode changes. The extra cost of orthogonalizations is often offset by savings\nbecause of recycling. Our second and third assumptions involve existence,\ninvertibility and boundedness of two matrices, which are easy to satisfy.\n  While satisfying the backward stability assumptions, by numerical experiments\nwe show that as we iteratively solve the linear systems arising in the AIRGA\nalgorithm more accurately, we obtain a more accurate reduced system. We also\nshow that recycling Krylov subspaces helps satisfy the backward stability\nassumptions (extra-orthogonalities) at almost no extra cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 15:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}
