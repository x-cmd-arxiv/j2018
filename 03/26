This information is represented in the form of a\nlabeled transition system, which we call skeleton. Each state of the skeleton\nis labeled with a three-valued assignment to the output variables: each output\ncan be true, false, or open, where true or false means that the value must be\ntrue or false, respectively, and open means that either value is still\npossible. We present algorithms for the verification of skeletons and for the\nlearning-based synthesis of skeletons from specifications in linear-time\ntemporal logic (LTL). The algorithm returns a skeleton that satisfies the given\nLTL specification in time polynomial in the size of the minimal skeleton. Our\nnew analysis technique can be used to recognize and repair specifications that\nunderspecify critical situations. The technique thus complements existing\nmethods for the recognition and repair of overspecifications via the\nidentification of unrealizable cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 16:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

We\nhere report direct numerical simulations of pulsatile pipe flow at low\npulsation amplitude A<0.4.

We model the\npropagation of different components of Galactic cosmic rays versus the column\ndensity of the gas. Our study is focussed on the propagation at high densities,\nabove a few g cm$^{-2}$, especially relevant for the inner regions of\ncollapsing clouds and circumstellar discs. The propagation of primary and\nsecondary CR particles (protons and heavier nuclei, electrons, positrons, and\nphotons) is computed in the continuous slowing down approximation, diffusion\napproximation, or catastrophic approximation, by adopting a matching procedure\nfor the different transport regimes. A choice of the proper regime depends on\nthe nature of the dominant loss process, modelled as continuous or\ncatastrophic. The CR ionisation rate is determined by CR protons and their\nsecondary electrons below $\\approx 130$ g cm$^{-2}$ and by electron/positron\npairs created by photon decay above $\\approx600$ g cm$^{-2}$. We show that a\nproper description of the particle transport is essential to compute the\nionisation rate in the latter case, since the electron/positron differential\nfluxes depend sensitively on the fluxes of both protons and photons.

Starting\nwith the simple observation that the logistic loss is $1$-mixable, we design a\nnew efficient improper learning algorithm for online logistic regression that\ncircumvents the aforementioned lower bound with a regret bound exhibiting a\ndoubly-exponential improvement in dependence on the predictor norm. This\nprovides a positive resolution to a variant of the COLT 2012 open problem of\nMcMahan and Streeter (2012) when improper learning is allowed.

When two interacting agents have the same\norientation become extremists with persuasion probability $p$, while if they\nhave opposite orientations become moderate with compromise probability $q$.\nThese updating rules lead to the formation of same-opinion domains with a\ncoarsening dynamics that depends on the ratio $r=p/q$. The population initially\nevolves to a centralized state for small $r$, where domains are composed by\nmoderate agents and coarsening is without surface tension, and to a\nbi-polarized state for large $r$, where domains are formed by extremist agents\nand coarsening is driven by curvature.

To\nrectify these differences, we propose a data driven approach using a deep\nlearning architecture known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs\nlearn to estimate two distributions, and can then be used to transform examples\nfrom one distribution into the other distribution. Here we transform\nT1-weighted brain images collected from two different sites into MR images from\nthe same site. We evaluate whether our model can reduce site-specific\ndifferences without loss of information related to gender (male, female) or\nclinical diagnosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, healthy). When trained\nappropriately, our model is able to normalise imaging sets to a common scanner\nset with less information loss compared to current approaches. An important\nadvantage is our method can be treated as a black box that does not require any\nknowledge of the sources of bias but only needs at least two distinct imaging\nsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 00:49:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 06:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-13"}

Based on the intrinsic nature of the LBM, we propose a simple and\nsecond-order accurate IB-LBM in this paper, where the no-slip boundary\ncondition on the fluid-solid interface is directly imposed by iteratively\ncorrecting the distribution function near the boundary, markedly similar to the\ntreatment of boundary condition in the original LBM. Therefore, there are no\nadditional efforts needed to construct an interfacial force model (such as the\nspring, feedback and direct force models) and absorb this force into the\nframework of LBM. It is worth mentioning that we retain the discrete delta\nfunction for the connection between the Lagrangian and Eulerian meshes, thus\npreserving the flexibility of the conventional IB-LBM. Second-order accuracy of\nthe present IB-LBM is reasonably confirmed in the simulation of cylindrical\nCouette flow, while the conventional approach is generally a first-order\nscheme. The present method is first validated in the flow past a fixed\ncylinder. No streamline penetration is found, indicating the exactly\nenforcement of the no-slip boundary condition. Furthermore, in the simulations\nof one and two particles settling under gravity, good agreements can be\nobserved comparing with the data available in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 01:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

To investigate\nthe potential underlying causes we perform a comparative study of the chemistry\nof T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be disks, using a model that pays special attention to\nphotochemistry. The warmer disk temperatures and higher ultraviolet flux of\nHerbig stars compared to T Tauri stars induce some differences in the disk\nchemistry.

We propose a\nnovel spatio-temporal Markov Random Field (MRF) model defined over pixels to\nhandle this problem. Unlike conventional MRF models, the spatial dependencies\namong pixels in our model are encoded by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\nSpecifically, for a given object, the probability of a labeling to a set of\nspatially neighboring pixels can be predicted by a CNN trained for this\nspecific object. As a result, higher-order, richer dependencies among pixels in\nthe set can be implicitly modeled by the CNN. With temporal dependencies\nestablished by optical flow, the resulting MRF model combines both spatial and\ntemporal cues for tackling video object segmentation. However, performing\ninference in the MRF model is very difficult due to the very high-order\ndependencies. To this end, we propose a novel CNN-embedded algorithm to perform\napproximate inference in the MRF.

It has long been established that the\neffect of such interactions on galaxy morphology depends strongly on the\norbital configuration, in particular the orientation of the intrinsic spin of\nthe galactic disk with respect to its orbital angular momentum. Prograde\nencounters modify the morphology strongly, including the formation of tidally\ninduced bars, while retrograde flybys should have little effect on morphology.\nRecent works on the subject reached conflicting conclusions, one using the\nimpulse approximation and claiming no dependence on this angle in the\nproperties of tidal bars. To resolve the controversy, we performed\nself-consistent N-body simulations of hyperbolic encounters between two\nidentical Milky Way-like galaxies assuming different velocities and impact\nparameters, with one of the galaxies on a prograde and the other on a\nretrograde orbit. The galaxies were initially composed of an exponential\nstellar disk and an NFW dark halo, and were stable against bar formation in\nisolation for 3 Gyr. We find that strong tidally induced bars form only in\ngalaxies on prograde orbits. For smaller impact parameters and lower relative\nvelocities the bars are stronger and have lower pattern speeds. Stronger bars\nundergo extended periods of buckling instability that thicken their vertical\nstructure. The encounters also lead to the formation of two-armed spirals with\nstrength inversely proportional to the strength of the bars. We conclude that\nproper modeling of prograde and retrograde encounters cannot rely on the\nsimplest impulse approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 08:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

It aims to learn a compact bitwise\nrepresentation for images via deep networks, so that similar images are mapped\nto nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of\nparameters, it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have,\nleading to model over-fitting. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose\na simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models, by regularizing the\ndeep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake\nimages from the original training set without extra data, via a generative\nadversarial network (GAN). In the second stage, we propose a deep architec-\nture to learn hash functions, in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to\nincorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss\nacts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture, by penalizing\nlow-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model\nensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight\nsharing but over different training sets. Empirical evaluation results on\nseveral benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has superior\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art hashing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 08:30:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 16:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Some of them formed the majority of their stars very\nlate compared to the others. Extreme examples are Leo A and Aquarius which\nreached the peak of star formation at $z<1$ ( > 6 Gyr after BB). This fact\nseemingly challenges the LCDM cosmology because the dark matter halos of these\ngalaxies on average should assemble the majority of their masses before z~2 (<3\nGyr after BB). In this work we investigate whether the delayed star formation\nhistories of some irregular dwarf galaxies could be explained purely by the\nstochasticity of their mass assembly histories coupled with the effect of\ncosmic reionization. We develop a semi-analytic model to follow the accretion\nof baryonic matter, star formation and stellar feedback in dark matter halos\nwith present day virial masses 10^9 M_Sun < M < 10^11 M_Sun and with different\nstochastic growth histories obtained using the PINOCCHIO code based on\nLagrangian perturbation theory. We obtain the distributions of observable\nparameters and the evolution histories for these galaxies. Accretion of\nbaryonic matter is strongly suppressed after the epoch of reionization in some\nmodels but they continue to accrete dark matter and eventually reach enough\nmass for accretion of baryonic matter to begin again. These \"reborn\" model\ngalaxies show very similar delayed star formation histories to those of Leo A\nand Aquarius. We find that the stochasticity caused by mass assembly histories\nis enhanced in systems with virial masses ~10^10 M_Sun because of their\nsensitivity to the photoionizing intergalactic radiation field after the epoch\nof reionization. This results in qualitatively different star formation\nhistories in late- and early-forming galaxies and it might explain the peculiar\nstar formation histories of irregular dwarf galaxies such as Leo A and\nAquarius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 09:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Since computing $b$ is NP-complete, a popular gold standard is\n$z$, the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse of the text, which is the\noptimal one when phrases can be copied only from the left. While $z$ can be\ncomputed in linear time with a greedy algorithm, almost nothing has been known\nfor decades about its approximation ratio with respect to $b$.

As a new example of ordered greedy\nparses, we introduce {\\em lexicographical} parses, where phrases can only be\ncopied from lexicographically smaller text locations. We prove that the size\n$v$ of the optimal lexicographical parse is also obtained greedily in $O(n)$\ntime, that $v=O(b\\log(n/b))$, and that there exists a text family where $v =\n\\Omega(b\\log n)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 11:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 19:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

However,\nassessing the performance of such generative models is notoriously difficult.\nMetrics that are typically used to assess the performance of such generative\nmodels are the percentage of chemically valid molecules or the similarity to\nreal molecules in terms of particular descriptors, such as the partition\ncoefficient (logP) or druglikeness. However, method comparison is difficult\nbecause of the inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, the necessity for\nmultiple metrics, and the fact that some of these measures can easily be\ntricked by simple rule-based systems. We propose a novel distance measure\nbetween two sets of molecules, called Fr\\'echet ChemNet distance (FCD), that\ncan be used as an evaluation metric for generative models. The FCD is similar\nto a recently established performance metric for comparing image generation\nmethods, the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID). Whereas the FID uses one of\nthe hidden layers of InceptionNet, the FCD utilizes the penultimate layer of a\ndeep neural network called ChemNet, which was trained to predict drug\nactivities. Thus, the FCD metric takes into account chemically and biologically\nrelevant information about molecules, and also measures the diversity of the\nset via the distribution of generated molecules. The FCD's advantage over\nprevious metrics is that it can detect if generated molecules are a) diverse\nand have similar b) chemical and c) biological properties as real molecules. We\nfurther provide an easy-to-use implementation that only requires the SMILES\nrepresentation of the generated molecules as input to calculate the FCD.\nImplementations are available at: https://www.github.com/bioinf-jku/FCD\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 11:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 06:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 14:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

For each\nsuch compression scheme, several different indexing solutions have been\nproposed in the last two decades. To date, the fastest indexes for repetitive\ntexts are based on the run-length compressed Burrows-Wheeler transform and on\nthe Compact Directed Acyclic Word Graph. The most space-efficient indexes, on\nthe other hand, are based on the Lempel-Ziv parsing and on grammar compression.\nIndexes for more universal schemes such as collage systems and macro schemes\nhave not yet been proposed. Very recently, Kempa and Prezza [STOC 2018] showed\nthat all dictionary compressors can be interpreted as approximation algorithms\nfor the smallest string attractor, that is, a set of text positions capturing\nall distinct substrings. Starting from this observation, in this paper we\ndevelop the first universal compressed self-index, that is, the first indexing\ndata structure based on string attractors, which can therefore be built on top\nof any dictionary-compressed text representation. Let $\\gamma$ be the size of a\nstring attractor for a text of length $n$.

This is, in particular, the first index\nfor general macro schemes and collage systems.

There has been recently much work devoted\nto the development of variants of the MH update which can handle scenarios\nwhere such an evaluation is impossible, and yet are guaranteed to sample from\n$\\pi$ asymptotically. The most popular approach to have emerged is arguably the\npseudo-marginal MH algorithm which substitutes an unbiased estimate of an\nunnormalised version of $\\pi$ for $\\pi$. Alternative pseudo-marginal algorithms\nrelying instead on unbiased estimates of the MH acceptance ratio have also been\nproposed. These algorithms can have better properties than standard PM\nalgorithms. Convergence properties of both classes of algorithms are known to\ndepend on the variability of the estimators involved and reduced variability is\nguaranteed to decrease the asymptotic variance of ergodic averages and will\nshorten the burn-in period, or convergence to equilibrium, in most scenarios of\ninterest. A simple approach to reduce variability, amenable to parallel\ncomputations, consists of averaging independent estimators. However, while\naveraging estimators of $\\pi$ in a pseudo-marginal algorithm retains the\nguarantee of sampling from $\\pi$ asymptotically, naive averaging of acceptance\nratio estimates breaks detailed balance, leading to incorrect results.

Measuring or\nconstraining the neutron star TLNs allows us in principle to exclude or\nconstraint many equations of state. This approach, however, has the drawback\nthat many modified theories of gravity could produce deviations from General\nRelativity similar to the deviations coming from the uncertainties in the\nequation of state.

We present\ndemonstrations of how scrutability from these neural networks can be gained and\nhow the combination of these techniques can be seen as an evolution of content\ntagging and a means for a recommender to balance user preferences inferred from\ndata with those explicitly specified. From validation of the models to the\ndevelopment of a UI, we discuss additional requisite functionality informed by\nthe results of a usability study leading to the ultimate deployment of the\nsystem at a university.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 12:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 03:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 20:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

Building tools and techniques that can help\nachieve such a goal is the chief aim for Automated Software Engineering (ASE)\nresearchers. However, in order to be effective an ASE researcher or\nprofessional must understand the characteristics of both successful and\nnot-so-successful ASE tools, and the constituent techniques employed by such\nASE tools. In this paper we present such a characterization of ASE tools and\nmajor constituent techniques from different areas of computer science and\nengineering that have been employed by such ASE tools. To develop the\ncharacterization we carried out an extensive systematic literature review over\nabout 1175 ASE research articles. One of our key goal was to identify useful\nrelationships among ASE tools, their constituent techniques and the software\ndevelopment life cycle activities that these tools targeted. In terms of\nchanges in popularity of constituent techniques with time we did not observe\nany clear trend. We organized the results of our characterization as a taxonomy\ncalled SEAT (Software Engineering Automation Taxonomy). A salient feature of\nSEAT is that it focuses on automation of activities from all phases of SDLC.\nSuch a taxonomy, among other applications, shall enable synthesizing new\nautomation tools for different SDLC activities. Recomposing existing systems to\nachieve better features will also be possible. Further, the taxonomy has been\nrealized as a graph database using neo4j(an open source graph database), which\ncan be queried using an SQL like language. The graph database allowed us to\nuncover hidden relationships by way of exhaustive search for connections and\npaths between different nodes (i.e. concepts). We demonstrate the efficacy of\nSEAT by discussing few practical use cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 12:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

But computing and learning\ncapabilities of RSNN models have remained poor, at least in comparison with\nartificial neural networks (ANNs). We address two possible reasons for that.\nOne is that RSNNs in the brain are not randomly connected or designed according\nto simple rules, and they do not start learning as a tabula rasa network.\nRather, RSNNs in the brain were optimized for their tasks through evolution,\ndevelopment, and prior experience. Details of these optimization processes are\nlargely unknown. But their functional contribution can be approximated through\npowerful optimization methods, such as backpropagation through time (BPTT).\n  A second major mismatch between RSNNs in the brain and models is that the\nlatter only show a small fraction of the dynamics of neurons and synapses in\nthe brain. We include neurons in our RSNN model that reproduce one prominent\ndynamical process of biological neurons that takes place at the behaviourally\nrelevant time scale of seconds: neuronal adaptation. We denote these networks\nas LSNNs because of their Long short-term memory. The inclusion of adapting\nneurons drastically increases the computing and learning capability of RSNNs if\nthey are trained and configured by deep learning (BPTT combined with a rewiring\nalgorithm that optimizes the network architecture). In fact, the computational\nperformance of these RSNNs approaches for the first time that of LSTM networks.\nIn addition RSNNs with adapting neurons can acquire abstract knowledge from\nprior learning in a Learning-to-Learn (L2L) scheme, and transfer that knowledge\nin order to learn new but related tasks from very few examples.

Typically, small gap and overlapping regions\ncan appear at the patch interfaces of such multipatch representations. In the\ncurrent work we consider multipatch representations having only small\noverlapping regions between the patches.\n  We develop a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)- IGA method which can be immediately\napplied to these representations. Our method appropriately connects the fluxes\nof the one face of the overlapping region with the flux of the opposite face.\nWe provide a theoretical justification of our approach by splitting the whole\nerror into two components: the first is related to the incorrect representation\nof the patches (consistency error) and the second to the approximation\nproperties of the IGA space. We show bounds for both components of the error.\nWe verify the theoretical error estimates in a series of numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 14:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Two different origins have been invoked for\nmetal-poor stars: they might be classical bulge stars or stars formed via\ninternal evolution of a massive thick disc. We use N-body simulations to\ncalculate the kinematic signature given by the difference in the mean\nGalactocentric radial velocity ($\\Delta\\rm V_{\\rm GC}$) between metal-rich\nstars ([Fe/H] $\\ge$ 0) and moderately metal-poor stars (-1.0 $\\le$ [Fe/H] $<$\n0) in two models, one containing a thin disc and a small classical bulge\n(B/D=0.1), and the other containing a thin disc and a massive centrally\nconcentrated thick disc. We reasonably assume that thin-disk stars in each\nmodel may be considered as a proxy of metal-rich stars. Similarly, bulge stars\nand thick-disc stars may be considered as a proxy of metal-poor stars. We\ncalculate $\\Delta\\rm V_{\\rm GC}$ at different latitudes ($b=0^\\circ$,\n$-2^\\circ$, $-4^\\circ$,$-6^\\circ$, $-8^\\circ$ and $-10^\\circ$) and longitudes\n($l=0^\\circ$, $\\pm5^\\circ$, $\\pm10^\\circ$ and $\\pm15^\\circ$) and show that the\n$\\Delta\\rm V_{\\rm GC}$ trends predicted by the two models are different.

If the channels\nare coupled, blockage of one causes an increase in the flux entering the\nremaining open channels leading to a cascade of failures. Once all channels are\nblocked no additional particle can enter the system. If the blockages are of\nfinite duration, however, the system reaches a steady state with an exiting\nflux that is reduced compared to the incoming one. We propose a stochastic\nmodel consisting of $N_c$ channels each with a blocking threshold of $N$\nparticles.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 15:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

We\naim at investigating the thermal, kinematic and magnetic properties of the\natmosphere responsible for these measured complex signals.\n  The SIR inversion code is employed to retrieve the physical parameters of the\nlower solar photosphere from the observed polarization signals. We follow two\ndifferent approaches. On the one hand, we consider that the multi-lobe circular\npolarization signals are only produced by the line-of-sight variation of the\nphysical parameters. We therefore invert the data assuming a single atmospheric\ncomponent that occupies the entire resolution element in the horizontal plane\nand where the physical parameters vary with optical depth (i.e.,\nline-of-sight). On the other hand, we consider that the multi-lobe circular\npolarization signals are produced not by the optical depth variations of the\nphysical parameters but instead by their horizontal variations. Here we invert\nthe data assuming that the resolution element is occupied by two different\natmospheric components where the kinematic and magnetic properties are constant\nalong the line-of-sight.\n  Both approaches reveal some common features about the topology responsible\nfor the observed three-lobed Stokes V signals: both a strong (>1000 Gauss) and\na very weak (< 10 Gauss) magnetic field with opposite polarities and harboring\nflows directed in opposite directions must co-exist (either vertically or\nhorizontally interlaced) within the resolution element.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 15:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Method: We performed workshops\nat four companies in order to determine relevant metrics as well as product and\nprocess factors. We also elicited how these metrics and factors are used and\ninterpreted by practitioners when making decisions in RSD. We specified the\nQ-Rapids quality model by comparing and integrating the results of the four\nworkshops.

The\ncropping patterns of rice and CGPRT crops highly depend on the availability of\nrainfall throughout the year. The changing and shifting of the rainy season\nresult in the changing cropping seasons. It is important to find out the\ncropping patterns of paddy and CGPRT crops based on monthly rainfall pattern in\nevery area. The Oldeman's method which is usually used in the classification of\nof cropping patterns of paddy and CGPRT crops is considered less able to\ndetermine the cropping patterns because it requires to see the rainfall data\nthroughout the year. This research proposes an alternative solution to\ndetermine the cropping pattern of paddy and CGPRT crops based on the pattern of\nrainfall in the area using decision tree approach. There were three algorithms,\nnamely, J48, RandomTree and REPTree, tested to determine the best algorithm\nused in the process of the classification of the cropping pattern in the area.\nThe results showed that J48 algorithm has a higher classification accuracy than\nRandomTree and REPTree for 48%, 42.67% and 38.67%, respectively.
