However, data labeling is often challenging and subject to high\nlevels of label noise. This can arise even when classification targets are well\ndefined, if instances to be labeled are more difficult than the prototypes used\nto define the class, leading to disagreements among the expert community. Here,\nwe enable efficient training of deep neural networks. From low-confidence\nlabels, we iteratively improve their quality by simultaneous learning of\nmachines and experts. We call it Human And Machine co-LEarning Technique\n(HAMLET). Throughout the process, experts become more consistent, while the\nalgorithm provides them with explainable feedback for confirmation. HAMLET uses\na neural embedding function and a memory module filled with diverse reference\nembeddings from different classes. Its output includes classification labels\nand highly relevant reference embeddings as explanation. We took the study of\nbrain monitoring at intensive care unit (ICU) as an application of HAMLET on\ncontinuous electroencephalography (cEEG) data. Although cEEG monitoring yields\nlarge volumes of data, labeling costs and difficulty make it hard to build a\nclassifier. Additionally, while experts agree on the labels of clear-cut\nexamples of cEEG patterns, labeling many real-world cEEG data can be extremely\nchallenging. Thus, a large minority of sequences might be mislabeled. HAMLET\nhas shown significant performance gain against deep learning and other\nbaselines, increasing accuracy from 7.03% to 68.75% on challenging inputs.\nBesides improved performance, clinical experts confirmed the interpretability\nof those reference embeddings in helping explaining the classification results\nby HAMLET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 16:29:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 13:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 05:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

However, the costs associated with\nbiometric processing and template protection are nontrivial for smart cards,\nkey fobs, and so forth. In this paper, we discuss the security, cost, and\nutility of biometric systems and develop two major frameworks for improving\nthem. First, we introduce a new framework for implementing biometric systems\nbased on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and hardware obfuscation that,\nunlike traditional software approaches, does not require nonvolatile storage of\na biometric template/key. Aside from reducing the risk of compromising the\nbiometric, the nature of obfuscation also provides protection against access\ncontrol circumvention via malware and fault injection. The PUF provides\nnon-invertibility and non-linkability. Second, a major requirement of the\nproposed PUF/obfuscation approach is that a reliable (robust) key be generated\nfrom the users input biometric. We propose a noiseaware biometric quantization\nframework capable of generating unique, reliable keys with reduced enrollment\ntime and denoising costs. Finally, we conduct several case studies. In the\nfirst, the proposed noise-aware approach is compared to our previous approach\nfor multiple biometric modalities, including popular ones (fingerprint and\niris) and emerging cardiovascular ones (ECG and PPG). The results show that ECG\nprovides the best tradeoff between reliability, key length, entropy, and cost.\nIn the second and third case studies, we demonstrate how reliability, denoising\ncosts, and enrollment times can be simultaneously improved by modeling subject\nintra-variations for ECG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 16:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

This transition manifests in peaks in the MC density fluctuation, a\nchange in the dependency of flow-rate on stickiness, and odd structure in the\neigenspectrum of the transition rate matrix. We derive and solve a fully\nnon-linear, analytic, mean-field solution, which has a crossover from a\npositive to a negative diffusion constant where the MC shows the transition.\nThe negative diffusion constant in fact indicates a breakdown of the mean-field\napproximation, with close to zero flow and breaking into a two-phase mixture,\nand thus the mean field theory successfully predicts its own demise.

These large datasets allow the identification\nof cancer-related sets of genetic alterations by identifying relevant\ncombinatorial patterns. Among such patterns, mutual exclusivity has been\nemployed by several recent methods that have shown its effectivenes in\ncharacterizing gene sets associated to cancer. Mutual exclusivity arises\nbecause of the complementarity, at the functional level, of alterations in\ngenes which are part of a group (e.g., a pathway) performing a given function.\nThe availability of quantitative target profiles, from genetic perturbations or\nfrom clinical phenotypes, provides additional information that can be leveraged\nto improve the identification of cancer related gene sets by discovering groups\nwith complementary functional associations with such targets.\n  In this work we study the problem of finding groups of mutually exclusive\nalterations associated with a quantitative (functional) target.

Therefore, 3D human pose estimation in the\nwild is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning\nframework, which distills the 3D human pose structures learned from the fully\nannotated dataset to in-the-wild images with only 2D pose annotations. Instead\nof defining hard-coded rules to constrain the pose estimation results, we\ndesign a novel multi-source discriminator to distinguish the predicted 3D poses\nfrom the ground-truth, which helps to enforce the pose estimator to generate\nanthropometrically valid poses even with images in the wild.

Hadron colliders are likely to determine the pace of\nparticle-physics progress also during the next hundred years. Discoveries at\npast hadron colliders were essential for establishing the so-called Standard\nModel of particle physics. The world's present flagship collider, the LHC,\nincluding its high-luminosity upgrade HL-LHC, is set to operate through the\nsecond half of the 2030's. Further increases of the energy reach during the\n21st century require another, still more powerful hadron collider. Three\noptions for a next hadron collider are presently under investigation. The\nFuture Circular Collider (FCC) study, hosted by CERN, is designing a 100 TeV\ncollider, to be installed inside a new 100 km tunnel in the Lake Geneva basin.\nA similar 100 km collider, called SppC, is being pursued by CAS-IHEP in China.\nIn either machine, for the first time in hadron storage rings, synchrotron\nradiation damping will be significant. In parallel, the synchrotron-radiation\npower emitted inside the cold magnets becomes an important design constraint.\nOne important difference between FCC and SppC is the magnet technology. FCC\nuses 16 Tesla magnets based on Nb3Sn superconductor, while SppC magnets shall\nbe realized with cables made from iron-based high-temperature superconductor.\nInitially the SppC magnets are assumed to provide a more moderate dipole field\nof 12 T, but they can later be pushed to a final ultimate field of 24 T. A\nthird collider presently under study is the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC), which is\na higher energy collider in the existing LHC tunnel, exploiting the FCC magnet\ntechnology in order to double the LHC energy at significantly higher\nluminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 17:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

As a result, traditional design paradigms become insufficient and,\nin contrast, resilient designs against system-wide failures and attacks become\nimportant. In general, resilient design problems are hard, and even though they\noften involve objective functions that are monotone or submodular, scalable\napproximation algorithms for their solution have been hitherto unknown. In this\npaper, we provide the first algorithm, enabling the following capabilities:\nminimal communication, i.e., the algorithm is executed by the robots based only\non minimal communication between them; system-wide resiliency, i.e., the\nalgorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks and failures;\nand provable approximation performance, i.e., the algorithm ensures for all\nmonotone (and not necessarily submodular) objective functions a solution that\nis finitely close to the optimal. We quantify our algorithm's approximation\nperformance using a notion of curvature for monotone set functions.

We also find interesting regional variations in regularization across\ncounties in the United States.

We perform MCMC simulations that\ninclude all these uncertainties at the individual galaxy level to compute the\nfinal LF, allowing, in particular, a crossover between magnitude bins.

Within the supermassive black hole's\ngravitational sphere of influence, the hot gas is multiphase and spans\ntemperatures from 0.2 to 1 keV. The radiative cooling time of the lowest\ntemperature gas drops to only 0.1-0.5 Myr, which is comparable to its free fall\ntime. Whilst the temperature structure is remarkably symmetric about the\nnucleus, the density gradient is steep in sectors to the N and S, with\n$\\rho{\\propto}r^{-1.5\\pm0.1}$, and significantly shallower along the jet axis\nto the E, where $\\rho{\\propto}r^{-0.93\\pm0.07}$.

When similar analysis tools are applied to both simulations and\nreal survey data, they provide powerful validation tests of the DES Y1\ncosmological analyses presented in companion papers. We use two suites of\ngalaxy simulations produced using different methods, which therefore provide\nindependent tests of our cosmological parameter inference. The cosmological\nanalysis we aim to validate is presented in DES Collaboration et al.

For one of the suites, we are\nable to show with high confidence that any biases in the inferred\n$S_8=\\sigma_8(\\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ and $\\Omega_m$ are smaller than the DES Y1\n$1-\\sigma$ uncertainties. For the other suite, for which we have fewer\nrealizations, we are unable to be this conclusive; we infer a roughly 70%\nprobability that systematic biases in the recovered $\\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ are\nsub-dominant to the DES Y1 uncertainty. As cosmological analyses of this kind\nbecome increasingly more precise, validation of parameter inference using\nsurvey simulations will be essential to demonstrate robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 19:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-16"}

This can\nlead to incorrect captions in domains where unbiased captions are desired, or\nrequired, due to over-reliance on the learned prior and image context. In this\nwork we investigate generation of gender-specific caption words (e.g. man,\nwoman) based on the person's appearance or the image context. We introduce a\nnew Equalizer model that ensures equal gender probability when gender evidence\nis occluded in a scene and confident predictions when gender evidence is\npresent. The resulting model is forced to look at a person rather than use\ncontextual cues to make a gender-specific predictions. The losses that comprise\nour model, the Appearance Confusion Loss and the Confident Loss, are general,\nand can be added to any description model in order to mitigate impacts of\nunwanted bias in a description dataset. Our proposed model has lower error than\nprior work when describing images with people and mentioning their gender and\nmore closely matches the ground truth ratio of sentences including women to\nsentences including men.

However, a straightforward\nimplementation of this LSH-enabled application has difficulty scaling beyond 3\nmonths of continuous time series data measured at a single seismic station. As\na case study of a data-driven science workflow, we illustrate how domain\nknowledge can be incorporated into the workload to improve both the efficiency\nand result quality. We describe several end-to-end optimizations of the\nanalysis pipeline from pre-processing to post-processing, which allow the\napplication to scale to time series data measured at multiple seismic stations.\nOur optimizations enable an over 100$\\times$ speedup in the end-to-end analysis\npipeline. This improved scalability enabled seismologists to perform seismic\nanalysis on more than ten years of continuous time series data from over ten\nseismic stations, and has directly enabled the discovery of 597 new earthquakes\nnear the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California and 6123 new\nearthquakes in New Zealand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 20:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 03:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

In particular, we investigate phase\ntransition, magnetic entropy and propagation speed of the damage on these\nlattices. Both the critical threshold parameter $p_{c}$ and the critical\nexponents are estimated with good precision. In order to investigate the\nincrease of statistical fluctuations and the onset of chaos in the critical\nregion of the model, we have also defined a magnetic entropy to these systems.\nIt is seen that the magnetic entropy behaves in a different way when one passes\nfrom the frozen regime ($p<p_{c}$) to the chaotic regime ($p>p_{c}$). For a\nfurther analysis, the robustness of the propagation of failures is checked by\nintroducing a quenched site dilution probability $q$ on the lattices. It is\nseen that the damage spreading is quite sensitive when a small fraction of the\nlattice sites are disconnected. A finite-size scaling analysis is employed to\nestimate the critical exponents. From these numerical estimates, we claim that\non both pure ($q=0$) and diluted ($q=0.05$) quasiperiodic lattices, the KCA\nmodel belongs to the same universality class than on square lattices.\nFurthermore, with the aim of comparing the dynamical behavior between periodic\nand quasiperiodic systems, the propagation speed of the damage is also\ncalculated for the square lattice assuming the same conditions. It is found\nthat on square lattices the propagation speed of the damage obeys a power law\nas $v\\sim (p-p_{c})^{\\alpha}$, whereas on quasiperiod lattices it follows a\nlogarithmic law as $v \\sim \\ln(p-p_{c})^\\alpha$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 20:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 18:57:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 12:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

Automatic\ndetection of epileptic seizures can considerably improve the patients' quality\nof life. Current Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure detection systems\nencounter many challenges in real-life situations. The EEGs are non-stationary\nsignals and seizure patterns vary across patients and recording sessions.\nMoreover, EEG data are prone to numerous noise types that negatively affect the\ndetection accuracy of epileptic seizures. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the use of a deep learning-based approach that automatically learns\nthe discriminative EEG features of epileptic seizures. Specifically, to reveal\nthe correlation between successive data samples, the time-series EEG data are\nfirst segmented into a sequence of non-overlapping epochs. Second, Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to learn the high-level\nrepresentations of the normal and the seizure EEG patterns. Third, these\nrepresentations are fed into Softmax function for training and classification.\nThe results on a well-known benchmark clinical dataset demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed approach over the existing state-of-the-art\nmethods. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be robust in noisy and real-life\nconditions. Compared to current methods that are quite sensitive to noise, the\nproposed method maintains its high detection performance in the presence of\ncommon EEG artifacts (muscle activities and eye-blinking) as well as white\nnoise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 02:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

We collect the radio, optical, and X-ray\ndata of knot-A, the closest knot from the core at 1 arcsec, and compile its\nspectral energy distribution (SED). Although the single-zone\nsynchrotron+SSC+IC/CMB model by assuming knot-A at rest can reproduce the SED\nin the radio-optical-X-ray band, the predicted gamma-ray flux is lower than the\nLAT observations and the derived magnetic field strength deviates the\nequipartition condition with 3 orders of magnitude. Assuming that knot-A is\nrelativistically moving, its SED from radio to gamma-ray bands would be well\nrepresented with the single-zone synchrotron+SSC+IC/CMB model under the\nequipartition condition. These results likely suggest that the gamma-ray\nemission may be from knot-A via the IC/CMB process and the knot should have\nrelativistical motion. The jet power derived from our model parameters is also\nroughly consistent with the kinetic power estimated with the radio data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 02:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Our\nnon-detection or upper limit of the velocity drift between ions and neutrals\ncould suggest that the magnetic field remains rather well coupled to the bulk\nneutral material on a 100 au scale in this source, and that any significant\nfield-matter decoupling, if present, likely occurs only on a smaller scale,\nleading to an accumulation of magnetic flux and thus efficient magnetic braking\nin the inner envelope. However, because of our limited angular resolution, we\ncannot rule out a significant ambipolar drift only in the midplane of the\ninfalling envelope. Future observations with higher angular resolutions (~0.1\")\nare needed to examine this possibility and ambipolar diffusion on a smaller\nscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 04:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Most of the\nnon-thermal ECE comes from runaway electrons in the low-energy regime with\nlarge pitch angle, which are strongly scattered by the excited whistler waves.\nThe power of ECE from runaway electrons is obtained using a synthetic\ndiagnostic model based on the reciprocity method. The electron distribution\nfunction is calculated using a kinetic simulation model including the whistler\nwave instabilities and the quasilinear diffusion effects. Simulations based on\nDIII-D low-density discharge reproduces the rapid growth of the ECE signals\nobserved in DIII-D experiments. Unlike the thermal ECE where radiation for a\ncertain frequency is strongly localized inside the resonance region, the\nnon-thermal ECE radiation from runaway electrons is nonlocal, and the\nemission-absorption ratio is higher than that of thermal electrons. The runaway\nelectron tail is more significant for ECE with higher frequencies, and the ECE\nspectrum becomes flatter as RE population grows. The nonlinear behavior of the\nkinetic instabilities is illustrated in the osculations of the ECE waves. The\ngood agreement with the DIII-D experimental observations after including the\nkinetic instabilities clearly illustrate the significance of the scattering\neffects from wave-particle interactions, which can also be important for\nrunaway electrons produced in disruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 04:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

We employ density functional theory\n(DFT) to determine the reasons behind the unusual catalytic properties of\n\\textbf{1} and the most likely mechanism for CO$_2$ reduction. The selectivity\nfor CO$_2$ over proton reduction is explained by analyzing the catalyst's\naffinity for the possible ligands present under typical reaction conditions:\nacetonitrile, water, CO$_2$, and bicarbonate. After reduction of the catalyst\nby two electrons, formation of [Co$^\\text{I}$N$_4$H]$^{+}$-CO$_{2}^{-}$ is\nstrongly favored. Based on thermodynamic and kinetic data, we establish that\nthe only likely route for producing CO from here consists of a protonation step\nto yield [Co$^\\text{I}$N$_4$H]$^{+}$-CO$_{2}$H, followed by reaction with\nCO$_2$ to form [Co$^\\text{II}$N$_4$H]$^{2+}$-CO and bicarbonate. This\nconclusion corroborates the idea of a direct role of CO$_2$ as a Lewis acid to\nassist in {C-O} bond dissociation, a conjecture put forward by other authors to\nexplain recent experimental observations.

To this end,\nfirst we show that integration of the existing reconfigurable antenna systems\nwith the well-known non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique causes a\nsignificant degradation in sum rate due to the inevitable power division in\nreconfigurable antennas. To circumvent this fundamental limit, a new multiple\naccess technique is proposed. The technique which is called reconfigurable\nantenna multiple access (RAMA) transmits only each user's intended signal at\nthe same time/frequency/code, which makes RAMA an inter-user interference-free\ntechnique. Two different cases are considered, i.e., RAMA with partial and full\nchannel state information (CSI). In the first case, CSI is not required and\nonly the direction of arrival for a specific user is used. Our analytical\nresults indicate that with partial CSI and for symmetric channels, RAMA\noutperforms NOMA in terms of sum rate. Further, the analytical result indicates\nthat RAMA for asymmetric channels achieves better sum rate than NOMA when less\npower is assigned to users that experience better channel quality. In the\nsecond case, RAMA with full CSI allocates optimal power to each user which\nleads to higher achievable rates compared to NOMA for both symmetric and\nasymmetric channels.

It is numerically confirmed that the proposed method successfully\nde-biases the LASSO estimator and constructs confidence intervals and p-values\nby experiments for noisy linear measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 07:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The RSG\nperiod-luminosity (PL) relation has been measured in the Milky Way, the\nMagellanic Clouds and M33 for about 120 stars in total. Using over 1500 epochs\nof R-band monitoring from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) survey over a\nfive-year period, we study the variability of 255 spectroscopically cataloged\nRSGs in M31. We find that all RGSs brighter than M_K~ -10 mag\n(log(L/L_sun)>4.8) are variable at dm_R>0.05 mag. Our period analysis finds 63\nwith significant pulsation periods. Using the periods found and the known\nvalues of M_K for these stars, we derive the RSG PL relation in M31 and show\nthat it is consistent with those derived earlier in other galaxies of different\nmetallicities.

Comparison to stellar evolution models from MESA\nconfirms the first overtone hypothesis and indicates that the variable stars in\nthis sample have 12 M_sun<M<24 M_sun. As these RSGs are the immediate\nprogenitors to Type II-P core-collapse supernovae (SNe), we also explore the\nimplication of their variability in the initial-mass estimates for SN\nprogenitors based on archival images of the progenitors.

If the direction angle of the desired received is\nknown, the desired channel gain vector is obtainable. Thus, in advance, the DM\ntransmitter knows the values of directional angles of desired user and\neavesdropper, or their direction of arrival (DOAs) because the beamforming\nvector of confidential messages and artificial noise (AN) projection matrix is\nmainly determined by directional angles of desired user and eavesdropper.

The proposed model, the complex-valued\nrestricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM), is designed to deal with complex-valued\nvisible units as an extension of the well-known restricted Boltzmann machine\n(RBM). Like the RBM, the CRBM learns the relationships between visible and\nhidden units without having connections between units in the same layer, which\ndramatically improves training efficiency by using Gibbs sampling or\ncontrastive divergence (CD). Another important characteristic is that the CRBM\nalso has connections between real and imaginary parts of each of the\ncomplex-valued visible units that help represent the data distribution in the\ncomplex domain. In speech signal processing, classification and generation\nfeatures are often based on amplitude spectra (e.g., MFCC, cepstra, and\nmel-cepstra) even if they are calculated from complex spectra, and they ignore\nphase information. In contrast, the proposed feature extractor using the CRBM\ndirectly encodes the complex spectra (or another complex-valued representation\nof the complex spectra) into binary-valued latent features (hidden units).\nSince the visible-hidden connections are undirected, we can also recover\n(decode) the complex spectra from the latent features directly.

This\npaper shows how to solve dynamic pricing by using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\ntechniques so that prices are maximized while keeping a balance between revenue\nand fairness. We demonstrate that RL provides two main features to support\nfairness in dynamic pricing: on the one hand, RL is able to learn from recent\nexperience, adapting the pricing policy to complex market environments; on the\nother hand, it provides a trade-off between short and long-term objectives,\nhence integrating fairness into the model's core.

On the one hand, SOC has been shown to emerge\nin spin glass systems of high dimensionality.

We unify these two faces of SOC by showing that emergence of\ncomplex features in biological evolution typically if not always is triggered\nby frustration that is caused by competing interactions at different\norganizational levels. Competing interactions and frustrated states permeate\nbiology at all organizational levels and are tightly linked to the ubiquitous\ncompetition for limiting resources.

Using tools from group theory this approach\nhas recently been extended to treat more general cluster states. However, the\nMSF and its generalisations require the determination of a set of Floquet\nmultipliers from variational equations obtained by linearisation around a\nperiodic orbit. Since closed form solutions for periodic orbits are invariably\nhard to come by the framework is often explored using numerical techniques.\nHere we show that further insight into network dynamics can be obtained by\nfocusing on piecewise linear (PWL) oscillator models. Not only do these allow\nfor the explicit construction of periodic orbits, their variational analysis\ncan also be explicitly performed.

The\northogonality among the calculated states is automatically fulfilled by solving\nthe Hill-Wheeler equation. This avoids the complexity of the frequently used\nGram-Schmidt orthogonalization, as adopted by the excited VAMPIR method.

The\naccuracy of the depth estimation has been improved from conditional Markov\nrandom fields, non-parametric methods, to deep convolutional neural networks\nmost recently. However, there exist inherent ambiguities in recovering 3D from\na single 2D image.

In order to learn monocular depth by embedding the focal\nlength, we propose a method to generate synthetic varying-focal-length dataset\nfrom fixed-focal-length datasets, and a simple and effective method is\nimplemented to fill the holes in the newly generated images.

This\nnoise introduction can be modeled as a type of protocol composition, i.e., a\nprobabilistic choice among different protocols, and its effect on the amount of\nleakage depends heavily on whether or not this choice is visible to the\nattacker. In this work, we consider operators for modeling visible and hidden\nchoice in protocol composition, and we study their algebraic properties. We\nthen formalize the interplay between defender and attacker in a game-theoretic\nframework adapted to the specific issues of QIF, where the payoff is\ninformation leakage. We consider various kinds of leakage games, depending on\nwhether players act simultaneously or sequentially, and on whether or not the\nchoices of the defender are visible to the attacker. In the case of sequential\ngames, the choice of the second player is generally a function of the choice of\nthe first player, and his/her probabilistic choice can be either over the\npossible functions (mixed strategy) or it can be on the result of the function\n(behavioral strategy). We show that when the attacker moves first in a\nsequential game with a hidden choice, then behavioral strategies are more\nadvantageous for the defender than mixed strategies. This contrasts with the\nstandard game theory, where the two types of strategies are equivalent.\nFinally, we establish a hierarchy of these games in terms of their information\nleakage and provide methods for finding optimal strategies (at the points of\nequilibrium) for both attacker and defender in the various cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 12:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 04:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Locks do not allow progress\nguarantees, because a task may fail inside a critical section and keep holding\na lock that blocks other tasks from accessing shared data. With non-blocking\nsynchronization, the drawbacks of locks are avoided by synchronizing access to\nshared data by atomic read-modify-write operations. To incorporate non-blocking\nsynchronization in Ada~202x, programmers must be able to reason about the\nbehavior and performance of tasks in the absence of protected objects and\nrendezvous. We therefore extend Ada's memory model by synchronized types, which\nsupport the expression of memory ordering operations at a sufficient level of\ndetail.

This recent result is in strong contrast with\nthe approximation of fixed atoms, which assumes that atoms are fixed to their\nequilibrium positions when light propagates in a medium and which is deeply\nrooted in the conventional electrodynamics of continuous media. In many\nphotonic materials, the atoms carry the majority of the total momentum of light\nand their motion also gives rise to net transfer of medium mass with a light\npulse. In this work, we use optoelastic continuum dynamics combining the\noptical force field, elasticity theory, and Newtonian mechanics to analyze the\nangular momentum carried by the MDW. We show that accounting for the MDW in the\nanalysis of the angular momentum gives for the field's share of the total\nangular momentum of light a quantized value that is generally a fraction of\n$\\hbar$. In contrast, the total angular momentum of the mass-polariton (MP)\nquasiparticle, which is a coupled state of the field and the MDW, and also the\nelementary quantum of light in a medium, is an integer multiple of $\\hbar$. The\nsame coupling is found for orbital and spin angular momentum components. The\nphysical picture of the angular momentum of light emerging from our theory is\nfundamentally more general than earlier theoretical models, in which the total\nangular momentum of light is assumed to be carried by the electromagnetic field\nonly or by an electronic polariton state, which also involves dipolar\nelectronic oscillations.

This\nscalar model is seen to be equivalent to a collection of Prandtl-Tomlinson\nparticles, which are coupled through an Eshelby quadrupolar kernel. Numerical\nsimulations of this scalar model reveal that the strain rate vs stress curve,\nclose to the critical stress, is of the form $\\dot\\gamma\\sim\n(\\sigma-\\sigma_c)^\\beta$. Remarkably, we find that the value of $\\beta$ depends\non details of the microscopic plastic potential used, confirming and giving\nadditional support to results previously obtained with the full tensorial\nmodel. %\\cite{Jagla_Yiel}. To rationalize this result, we argue that the\nEshelby interaction in the scalar model can be treated to a good approximation\nin a sort of \"dynamical\" mean field, which corresponds to a Prandtl-Tomlinson\nparticle that is driven by the applied strain rate in the presence of a\nstochastic noise generated by all other particles. The dynamics of this\nPrandtl-Tomlinson particle displays different values of the $\\beta$ exponent\ndepending on the analytical properties of the microscopic potential, thus\ngiving support to the results of the numerical simulations. Moreover, we find\nthat other critical exponents that depend on details of the dynamics show also\na dependence with the form of the disorder, while static exponents are\nindependent of the details of the disorder. Finally, we show how our scalar\nmodel relates to other elastoplastic models and to the widely used mean field\nversion known as the H\\'ebraud-Lequeux model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

However, existing object proposal generation methods often suffer\nfrom the problems of motion blur, low contrast, deformation, etc., when they\nare applied to video related tasks. In this paper, we propose an effective and\nhighly accurate target-specific object proposal generation (TOPG) method, which\ntakes full advantage of the context information of a video to alleviate these\nproblems. Specifically, we propose to generate target-specific object proposals\nby integrating the information of two important objectness cues: colors and\nedges, which are complementary to each other for different challenging\nenvironments in the process of generating object proposals. As a result, the\nrecall of the proposed TOPG method is significantly increased. Furthermore, we\npropose an object proposal ranking strategy to increase the rank accuracy of\nthe generated object proposals. The proposed TOPG method has yielded\nsignificant recall gain (about 20%-60% higher) compared with several\nstate-of-the-art object proposal methods on several challenging visual tracking\ndatasets. Then, we apply the proposed TOPG method to the task of visual\ntracking and propose a TOPG-based tracker (called as TOPGT), where TOPG is used\nas a sample selection strategy to select a small number of high-quality target\ncandidates from the generated object proposals. Since the object proposals\ngenerated by the proposed TOPG cover many hard negative samples and positive\nsamples, these object proposals can not only be used for training an effective\nclassifier, but also be used as target candidates for visual tracking.\nExperimental results show the superior performance of TOPGT for visual tracking\ncompared with several other state-of-the-art visual trackers (about 3%-11%\nhigher than the winner of the VOT2015 challenge in term of distance precision).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 14:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

Since the resulting stellar debris can produce\nan electromagnetic flare, TDEs are believed to probe the presence of single\nSMBHs in galactic nuclei, which otherwise remain dark. In this paper, we show\nhow stars orbiting an IMBH secondary are perturbed by an SMBH primary. We find\nthat the evolution of the stellar orbits are severely affected by the primary\nSMBH due to secular effects and stars orbiting with high inclinations with\nrespect to the SMBH-IMBH orbital plane end their lives as TDEs due to\nKozai-Lidov oscillations, hence illuminating the secondary SMBH/IMBH. Above a\ncritical SMBH mass of $\\approx 1.15 \\times 10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$, no TDE can occur\nfor typical stars in an old stellar population since the Schwarzschild radius\nexceeds the tidal disruption radius. Consequently, any TDEs due to such massive\nSMBHs will remain dark. It follows that no TDEs should be observed in galaxies\nwith bulges more massive than $\\approx 4.15\\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, unless\na lower-mass secondary SMBH or IMBH is also present. The secular mechanism for\nproducing TDEs considered here therefore offers a useful probe of\nSMBH-SMBH/IMBH binarity in the most massive galaxies.

Three\ngradient-based estimation algorithms are derived using the maximum likelihood\nprinciple and are compared with the Natural Gradient algorithm for Independent\nComponent Analysis and with One-unit FastICA based on negentropy maximization.\nThe ideas and algorithms are also generalized for the extraction of a vector\ncomponent when the extraction proceeds jointly from a set of instantaneous\nmixtures. Throughout the paper, we address the problem of the size of the\nregion of convergence for which the algorithms guarantee the extraction of the\ndesired source. We show how that size is influenced by the ratio of powers of\nthe sources within the mixture. Simulations confirm this observation where\nseveral algorithms are compared. They show various convergence behavior in a\nscenario where the source of interest is dominant or weak. Here, our proposed\nmodifications of the gradient methods taking into account the\ndominance/weakness of the source show improved global convergence property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 14:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is\nalso in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the\ncurrent DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test\nthrough assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 14:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Uncertainty\nabout the value of these parameters at the design stage means that there is\noften a risk a trial may be under- or over-powered. For many study designs,\nthis problem has been addressed by considering adaptive design methodology that\nallows for the re-estimation of the required sample size during a trial. Here,\nwe propose and compare several approaches for this in multi-treatment crossover\ntrials. Specifically, regulators favour re-estimation procedures to maintain\nthe blinding of the treatment allocations. We therefore develop blinded\nestimators for the within and between person variances, following simple or\nblock randomisation. We demonstrate that, provided an equal number of patients\nare allocated to sequences that are balanced for period, the proposed\nestimators following block randomisation are unbiased. We further provide a\nformula for the bias of the estimators following simple randomisation. The\nperformance of these procedures, along with that of an unblinded approach, is\nthen examined utilising three motivating examples, including one based on a\nrecently completed four-treatment four-period crossover trial. Simulation\nresults show that the performance of the proposed blinded procedures is in many\ncases similar to that of the unblinded approach, and thus they are an\nattractive alternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 15:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

Despite the great achievements of the\npast decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction\nstill appears to be out of reach, especially in challenging environments\ncharacterized by significant noise and reverberation. To improve robustness,\nmodern speech recognizers often employ acoustic models based on Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs), that are naturally able to exploit large time contexts\nand long-term speech modulations. It is thus of great interest to continue the\nstudy of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs in\nprocessing speech signals.\n  In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned out\nto be very effective for ASR. The contribution of this work is two-fold: First,\nwe analyze the role played by the reset gate, showing that a significant\nredundancy with the update gate occurs. As a result, we propose to remove the\nformer from the GRU design, leading to a more efficient and compact single-gate\nmodel. Second, we propose to replace hyperbolic tangent with ReLU activations.\nThis variation couples well with batch normalization and could help the model\nlearn long-term dependencies without numerical issues.\n  Results show that the proposed architecture, called Light GRU (Li-GRU), not\nonly reduces the per-epoch training time by more than 30% over a standard GRU,\nbut also consistently improves the recognition accuracy across different tasks,\ninput features, noisy conditions, as well as across different ASR paradigms,\nranging from standard DNN-HMM speech recognizers to end-to-end CTC models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 17:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

As not all frames may characterize the\nunderlying action---indeed, many are common across multiple actions---pooling\nschemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be unfavorable. In an\nattempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the\nnotion that among the deep features generated on all short clips, there is at\nleast one that characterizes the action. To this end, we learn a (nonlinear)\nhyperplane that separates this unknown, yet discriminative, feature from the\nrest. Applying multiple instance learning in a large-margin setup, we use the\nparameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the full video\nsegment. Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in\na max-margin framework, they serve as robust representations for pooling of the\nfeatures. We formulate a joint objective and an efficient solver that learns\nthese hyperplanes per video and the corresponding action classifiers over the\nhyperplanes.

Generally, these tensors are Poisson brackets tensor and a symmetric\nmetric tensor that models purely dissipative dynamics. In this paper, the\nmetriplectic system describing a simplified two-photon absorption by a\ntwo-level atom is disclosed. The Hamiltonian component describes the free\nelectromagnetic radiation. The metric component encodes the radiation-matter\ncoupling, driving the system to an asymptotically stable state in which the\nexcited level of the atom is populated due to absorption. This work is intended\nas a first result to pave the way to apply the metriplectic formalism to many\nother irreversible processes in nonlinear optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 15:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

We find that a total of five steps represents the most plausible\nestimate, in agreement with previous studies, and use the fossil record to\nidentify the potential candidates. We apply the model to Earth-analogs around\nstars of different masses by incorporating the constraints on habitability set\nby stellar physics including the habitable zone lifetime, availability of\nultraviolet radiation for prebiotic chemistry, and atmospheric escape. The\ncritical step model suggests that the habitability of Earth-analogs around\nM-dwarfs is significantly suppressed. The total number of stars with planets\ncontaining detectable biosignatures of microbial life is expected to be highest\nfor K-dwarfs. In contrast, we find that the corresponding value for intelligent\nlife (technosignatures) should be highest for solar-mass stars.
