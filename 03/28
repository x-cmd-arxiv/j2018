A\nwell-known and widely used iterative algorithm is the Newton's method.

In this paper, we present a new\nclass of methods that improve upon the classical Newton's method. The key idea\nbehind the new approach is to develop a relatively simple multiplicative\ntransformation of the original equations, which leads to a significant\nreduction in nonlinearities, thereby alleviating the limitations of the\nNewton's method. Based on this idea, we propose two novel classes of methods\nand present their application to several mathematical functions (real, complex,\nand vector). Across all examples, our numerical experiments suggest that the\nnew methods converge for a significantly wider range of initial guesses with\nminimal increase in computational cost. Given the ubiquity of Newton's method,\nan improvement in its applicability and convergence is a significant step\nforward, and will reduce computation times several-folds across many\ndisciplines.

We focus on two particularly interesting scenarios. First, we fix\nthe connection to be metric compatible, but we follow a completely covariant\napproach by imposing the constraints with suitable Lagrange multipliers. For a\ngeneral quadratic theory we show how torsion naturally propagates and we\nreproduce the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity as a particular\nquadratic action that features an additional Lorentz symmetry. We then study\nthe much less explored theories formulated in a geometry with neither curvature\nnor torsion, so that all the geometrical information is encoded in the\nnon-metricity. We discuss how this geometrical framework leads to a purely\ninertial connection that can thus be completely removed by a coordinate gauge\nchoice, the coincident gauge. From the quadratic theory we recover a simpler\nformulation of General Relativity in the form of the Einstein action, which\nenjoys an enhanced symmetry that reduces to a second linearised diffeomorphism\nat linear order. More general theories in both geometries can be formulated\nconsistently by taking into account the inertial connection and the associated\nadditional degrees of freedom. As immediate applications, the new cosmological\nequations and their Newtonian limit are considered, where the role of the lapse\nin the consistency of the equations is clarified, and the Schwarzschild black\nhole entropy is computed by evaluating the corresponding Euclidean action.

Such systems include a set of reactive\nvalues that are periodically updated in response to external or internal events\nto form a dataflow in the sense that such updates are propagated to other\nreactive values. Two effective approaches for realizing such reactive values\nhave been proposed: the event mechanisms in event-based programming and the\nsignals in functional-reactive programming. These two approaches are now\nbecoming mixed in several languages such as Flapjax and REScala, which makes\nthese languages notably expressive for modularizing the implementation of\nreactive software. For example, REScala provides a rich API that consists of\nfunctions converting events to signals and vice versa.\n  In this paper, we explore another, simpler approach in the design space of\nreactive programming languages: the event mechanism is harmonized with signals,\nresulting in a simplified programming interface that is mostly based on\nsignals. Based on this approach, we realize SignalJ, a simple extension of Java\nwith events and signals. Our notable findings are (1) an event can be\nrepresented as an update of a signal and (2) such an effectful signal can be\nrepresented using annotations instead of introducing types and constructors for\nsignals to further simplify the language.\n  Another contribution of this paper is the formal model of SignalJ. As both\nmechanisms of events and signals may interfere with each other, this mixing\nsometimes results in surprising behavior. For example, the functional behavior\nof signals is affected by the imperative features of events. Thus,\nunderstanding the formal model of this mixing is actually important.

Most of these techniques, however, exist only as research prototypes\nand are not available in mainstream database systems. This means scientists\nmust either implement such techniques themselves or (all too often) go without.\n  This is essentially a code reuse problem: provenance techniques currently\ncannot be implemented reusably, only as ad hoc, usually unmaintained extensions\nto standard databases. An alternative, relatively unexplored approach is to\nsupport such techniques at a higher abstraction level, using metaprogramming or\nreflection techniques. Can advanced programming techniques make it easier to\ntransfer provenance research results into practice?\n  We build on a recent approach called language-integrated provenance, which\nextends language-integrated query techniques with source-to-source query\ntranslations that record provenance.

In this paper, we show how to adapt\nthis approach to work in Haskell building on top of the Database-Supported\nHaskell (DSH) library.\n  Even though it seemed clear in principle that Haskell's rich programming\nfeatures ought to be sufficient, implementing language-integrated provenance in\nHaskell required overcoming a number of technical challenges due to\ninteractions between these capabilities.

If one posits that the\nend-state of stellar-mass binary black hole mergers, of the type observed in\nGW150914, can be these wormholes, then we show how their properties can be\nmeasured from their distinct signatures in the gravitational waves emitted by\nthem as they settle down in the post-merger phase from an initially perturbed\nstate.

They allow formalizing the syntax of domain-specific or\ngeneral-purpose programming languages concisely and declaratively. However, the\nnatural and concise way of writing a context-free grammar is often ambiguous.\nTherefore, grammar formalisms support extensions in the form of *declarative\ndisambiguation rules* to specify operator precedence and associativity, solving\nambiguities that are caused by the subset of the grammar that corresponds to\nexpressions.\n  **Inquiry** Implementing support for declarative disambiguation within a\nparser typically comes with one or more of the following limitations in\npractice: a lack of parsing performance, or a lack of modularity (i.e.,\ndisallowing the composition of grammar fragments of potentially different\nlanguages). The latter subject is generally addressed by scannerless\ngeneralized parsers. We aim to equip scannerless generalized parsers with novel\ndisambiguation methods that are inherently performant, without compromising the\nconcerns of modularity and language composition.\n  **Approach** In this paper, we present a novel low-overhead implementation\ntechnique for disambiguating deep associativity and priority conflicts in\nscannerless generalized parsers with lightweight data-dependency.\n  **Knowledge** Ambiguities with respect to operator precedence and\nassociativity arise from combining the various operators of a language. While\n*shallow conflicts* can be resolved efficiently by one-level tree patterns,\n*deep conflicts* require more elaborate techniques, because they can occur\narbitrarily nested in a tree. Current state-of-the-art approaches to solving\ndeep priority conflicts come with a severe performance overhead.\n  **Grounding** We evaluated our new approach against state-of-the-art\ndeclarative disambiguation mechanisms. By parsing a corpus of popular\nopen-source repositories written in Java and OCaml, we found that our approach\nyields speedups of up to 1.73x over a grammar rewriting technique when parsing\nprograms with deep priority conflicts--with a modest overhead of 1-2 % when\nparsing programs without deep conflicts.\n  **Importance** A recent empirical study shows that deep priority conflicts\nare indeed wide-spread in real-world programs. The study shows that in a corpus\nof popular OCaml projects on Github, up to 17 % of the source files contain\ndeep priority conflicts. However, there is no solution in the literature that\naddresses efficient disambiguation of deep priority conflicts, with support for\nmodular and composable syntax definitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 17:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

By using a novel approach\nbased on deep-learning to select the best model to fit, we manage to control\nsystematics arising from wrong model selection and obtain less contaminated\nsamples than previous works. We show that the derived structural properties are\nwithin $\\sim10-20\\%$ of random uncertainties. We then fit stellar population\nmodels to the decomposed SEDs (Spectral Energy Distribution) of bulges and\ndisks and derive stellar masses (and stellar mass bulge-to-total ratios) as\nwell as rest-frame colors (U,V,J) for bulges and disks separately. All data\nproducts are publicly released with this paper and through the web page\nhttps://lerma.obspm.fr/huertas/form_CANDELS and will be used for scientific\nanalysis in forthcoming works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 16:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Modeling galaxies'\nSED with a delayed-$\\tau$ star formation history (SFH), with and without\nallowing an instantaneous SFR drop within the last hundreds Myr, we isolate 102\ncandidates out of a subsample of 6,680 galaxies classified as star-forming from\nthe UVJ criterion in the ZFOURGE catalogues.

The morphology of the candidates show no preference\nfor a particular type. Among the 102 candidates, only 4 show signs of an AGN\nactivity (from X-ray luminosity or UV-IR SED fitting decomposition).

Using this relation, we predict intrinsic Mg II flux,\nand show that Mg II escape fractions range from 0 to 0.9. We find that the Mg\nII escape fraction correlates tightly with the Lyman Alpha escape fraction, and\nthe Mg II line profiles show evidence for broader and more redshifted emission\nwhen the escape fractions are low. These trends are expected if the escape\nfractions and velocity profiles of Lyman Alpha and Mg II are shaped by resonant\nscattering in the same low column density gas.

In this paper, we explain why surges are natural sites\nto show enhanced emissivity in TR lines. We performed 2.5D radiative-MHD\nnumerical experiments using the Bifrost code including the nonequilibrium\nionization of silicon and oxygen. A surge is obtained as a by-product of\nmagnetic flux emergence; the TR enveloping the emerged domain is strongly\naffected by nonequilibrium effects: assuming statistical equilibrium would\nproduce an absence of Si IV and O IV ions in most of the region. Studying the\nproperties of the surge plasma emitting in the Si IV 1402.77 {\\AA} and O IV\n1401.16 {\\AA} lines, we find that a) the timescales for the optically-thin\nlosses and heat conduction are very short, leading to departures from\nstatistical equilibrium, and b) the surge emits in Si IV more and has an\nemissivity ratio of Si IV to O IV larger than a standard TR. Using synthetic\nspectra, we conclude the importance of line-of-sight effects: given the\ninvolved geometry of the surge, the line-of-sight can cut the emitting layer at\nsmall angles and/or cross it multiple times, causing prominent, spatially\nintermittent brightenings both in Si IV and O IV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 18:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

In loop quantum gravity and its spin foam description, it has not been\npossible so far to calculate the spectral dimension of spacetime. As a first\nstep towards this goal, here we determine the spacetime spectral dimension in\nthe simplified spin foam model restricted to hypercuboids. Using Monte Carlo\nmethods we compute the spectral dimension for state sums over periodic spin\nfoam configurations on infinite lattices. For given periodicity, i.e. number of\ndegrees of freedom, we find a range of scale where an intermediate spectral\ndimension between 0 and 4 can be found, continuously depending on the parameter\nof the model. Under an assumption on the statistical behaviour of the Laplacian\nwe can explain these results analytically. This allows us to take the\nthermodynamic limit of large periodicity and find a phase transition from a\nregime of effectively 0-dimensional to 4-dimensional spacetime. At the point of\nphase transition, dynamics of the model are scale invariant which can be seen\nas restoration of diffeomorphism invariance of flat space. Considering the\nspectral dimension as an order parameter for renormalization we find a\nrenormalization group flow to this point as well. Being the first instance of\nan emergence of 4-dimensional spacetime in a spin foam model, the properties\nresponsible for this result seem to be rather generic.

Short-period planets experienced\ndynamical and evolutions histories distinct from their farther-out cousins, and\nso it's not clear they are representative of all planets.

In this\npaper, this extra information provided by the common sources generating the\ndata is encoded in a graph, and is invoked as a graph regularizer.

This paper presents a novel approach for\nlearning and exploiting surface data directly across surface domains. Current\napproaches rely on geometrical simplifications, such as spherical inflations, a\npopular but costly process.

The results for Neptune indicate that in the absence of\nstratospheric circulation or other meridional transport processes, the\nhydrocarbon abundances exhibit strong seasonal and meridional variations in the\nupper stratosphere, but that these variations become increasingly damped with\ndepth due to increasing dynamical and chemical time scales. At high altitudes,\nhydrocarbon mixing ratios are typically largest where the solar insolation is\nthe greatest, leading to strong hemispheric dichotomies between the\nsummer-to-fall hemisphere and winter-to-spring hemisphere. At mbar pressures\nand deeper, slower chemistry and diffusion lead to latitude variations that\nbecome more symmetric about the equator. On Uranus, the stagnant, poorly mixed\nstratosphere confines methane and its photochemical products to higher\npressures, where chemistry and diffusion time scales remain large. Seasonal\nvariations in hydrocarbons are therefore predicted to be more muted on Uranus,\ndespite the planet's very large obliquity. Radiative-transfer simulations\ndemonstrate that latitude variations in hydrocarbons on both planets are\npotentially observable with future JWST mid-infrared spectral imaging.

A few significant issues with\nthese approaches are that drone control is limited by the range of\nelectromagnetic radiation and susceptible to interference noise. In this study\nwe propose the use of hand gestures as a method to control drones. We\ninvestigate the use of computer vision methods to develop an intuitive way of\nagent-less communication between a drone and its operator. Computer\nvision-based methods rely on the ability of a drone's camera to capture\nsurrounding images and use pattern recognition to translate images to\nmeaningful and/or actionable information. The proposed framework involves a few\nkey parts toward an ultimate action to be taken. They are: image segregation\nfrom the video streams of front camera, creating a robust and reliable image\nrecognition based on segregated images, and finally conversion of classified\ngestures into actionable drone movement, such as takeoff, landing, hovering and\nso forth. A set of five gestures are studied in this work. Haar feature-based\nAdaBoost classifier is employed for gesture recognition. We also envisage\nsafety of the operator and drone's action calculating the distance based on\ncomputer vision for this task. A series of experiments are conducted to measure\ngesture recognition accuracies considering the major scene variabilities,\nillumination, background, and distance. Classification accuracies show that\nwell-lit, clear background, and within 3 ft gestures are recognized correctly\nover 90%.

To provide\nfurther insight on the interaction between ammonia molecules (NH3) and graphene\ndevices, we report experimental and theoretical studies of NH3 graphene sensors\nwith graphene supported on three substrates: SiO2, talc and hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN). Our results indicate that the charge transfer from NH3 to\ngraphene depends not only on extrinsic parameters like temperature and gas\nconcentration, but also on the average distance between the graphene sheet and\nthe substrate. We find that the average distance between graphene and hBN\ncrystals is the smallest among the three substrates, and that graphene-ammonia\ngas sensors based on a G/hBN heterostructure exhibit the fastest recovery times\nfor NH3 exposure and are slightly affected by wet or dry air environment.\nMoreover, the dependence of graphene-ammonia sensors on different substrates\nindicates that graphene sensors exhibit two different adsorption processes for\nNH3 molecules: one at the top of the graphene surface and another at its bottom\nside close to the substrate. Therefore, our findings show that substrate\nengineering is crucial to the development of graphene-based gas sensors and\nindicate additional routes for faster sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 22:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

It is based upon the Maxwell-Sylvester geometric representation of the\nmultipolar electrostatic potential. In the latter, an order-$\\ell$ multipolar\npotential is represented by a collection of $\\ell$ equal length vectors, i.e.\nby $\\ell$ points on a sphere, instead of by its components on some fixed (but\narbitrary) basis. The geometric representation offers a much more appropriate\ntool for getting physical insight on specific characteristics of a multipole,\nsuch as its symmetries, or its departure from ideal symmetry. We derive\nexplicit expressions enabling to perform any calculations we may need to\nperform on multipoles. All relevant quantities are eventually expressed in\nterms of scalar products of pairs of vectors (i.e., in terms of geometric\nquantities such as lengths and angles). The whole formalism is entirely\nindependent of any particular choice of coordinate, and needs no use of the\nsomehow abstract formalism traditionally used when dealing with angular\nmomenta.\n  The formalism is then applied to treat the problem of the irreducible tensor\noperators of quantum spin systems. It enables to completely dispense with the\ncalculation and use of the Stevens operators, which can be quite complicated\neven for moderate values of $\\ell$. Explicit expressions for the calculation of\nexpectations values of physical observables are derived. They essentially\nconsist in combinations of scalar products of vector pairs. Together with the\ncoherent state representation of the quantum states of spin systems, this\nprovides a complete geometric, coordinate-free, description of the states,\ndynamics and physical properties of these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 23:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

Clearly, a $1$-factorization of $G$\ncannot exist unless $n$ is even and $G$ is regular (that is, all vertices are\nof the same degree). The problem of finding $1$-factorizations in graphs goes\nback to a paper of Kirkman in 1847 and has been extensively studied since then.\nDeciding whether a graph has a $1$-factorization is usually a very difficult\nquestion. For example, it took more than 60 years and an impressive tour de\nforce of Csaba, K\\\"uhn, Lo, Osthus and Treglown to prove an old conjecture of\nDirac from the 1950s, which says that every $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices\ncontains a $1$-factorization, provided that $n$ is even and $d\\geq 2\\lceil\n\\frac{n}{4}\\rceil-1$.

In this paper, we consider the problem of finding\n$1$-factorizations of regular, pseudorandom graphs.

Interestingly, a recent advance\nin neuroscience [Barrett-Den\\`eve-Machens, NIPS 2013] showed that the neurons'\nfiring rate, i.e., the average number of spikes fired per unit of time, can be\ncharacterized by the optimal solution of a quadratic program defined by the\nparameters of the dynamics. This indicated that SNN potentially has the\ncomputational power to solve non-trivial quadratic programs. However, the\nresults were justified empirically without rigorous analysis.\n  We put this into the context of natural algorithms and aim to investigate the\nalgorithmic power of SNN. Especially, we emphasize on giving rigorous\nasymptotic analysis on the performance of SNN in solving optimization problems.\nTo enforce a theoretical study, we first identify a simplified SNN model that\nis tractable for analysis. Next, we confirm the empirical observation in the\nwork of Barrett et al. by giving an upper bound on the convergence rate of SNN\nin solving the quadratic program. Further, we observe that in the case where\nthere are infinitely many optimal solutions, SNN tends to converge to the one\nwith smaller l1 norm. We give an affirmative answer to our finding by showing\nthat SNN can solve the l1 minimization problem under some regular conditions.\n  Our main technical insight is a dual view of the SNN dynamics, under which\nSNN can be viewed as a new natural primal-dual algorithm for the l1\nminimization problem. We believe that the dual view is of independent interest\nand may potentially find interesting interpretation in neuroscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 01:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 20:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

Intuitively, putting together game avatars\nthat complement each other (synergy) and suppress those of opponents\n(opposition) would result in a stronger team. In-depth understanding of synergy\nand opposition relationships among game avatars benefits player in making\ndecisions in game avatar drafting and gaining better prediction of match\nevents. However, due to intricate design and complex interactions between game\navatars, thorough understanding of their relationships is not a trivial task.\n  In this paper, we propose a latent variable model, namely Game Avatar\nEmbedding (GAE), to learn avatars' numerical representations which encode\nsynergy and opposition relationships between pairs of avatars. The merits of\nour model are twofold: (1) the captured synergy and opposition relationships\nare sensible to experienced human players' perception; (2) the learned\nnumerical representations of game avatars allow many important downstream\ntasks, such as similar avatar search, match outcome prediction, and avatar pick\nrecommender.

Alignment of scene contents are done at the SP level, which proves to be\nrobust towards rain occlusion and fast camera motion. Two alignment output\ntensors, i.e., optimal temporal match tensor and sorted spatial-temporal match\ntensor, provide informative clues for rain streak location and occluded\nbackground contents to generate an intermediate derain output. These tensors\nwill be subsequently prepared as input features for a convolutional neural\nnetwork to restore high frequency details to the intermediate output for\ncompensation of mis-alignment blur.

The critical influence of polishing has\nbeen systematically investigated by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy\nand X-ray diffraction. The stress state around polishing scratches gives rise\nto preferential transformation in the zone of the induced scratches and\nconsequently to accelerated ageing. The influence of residual stresses is\nanalyzed semi-quantitatively by preparing samples with various surface finish,\nthus with various stress states. Rough polishing produces a compressive surface\nstress layer beneficial for the ageing resistance, while smooth polishing\nproduces preferential transformation nucleation around scratches. When a\nthermal treatment of 2 h at 1200 {\\deg}C is applied to relax the residual\nstresses, all the surfaces states exhibit the same sensitivity to ageing. These\nresults demonstrate that roughness alone cannot be used for ensuring a\nlong-term stability. The variation of ageing sensitivity is indeed related\nindirectly to the surface roughness via the induced surface stress state. The\ncurrent ISO standards are not able to take these effects into account.

In this work, we primarily\nfocus on quantifying the impact of non-local mixing, which is not taken into\naccount in Zahn's mixing model \\citep{Zahn92}. We present the results of direct\nnumerical simulations in a new model setup designed to contain coexisting\nlaminar and turbulent shear layers. As in Part I, we use the Low P\\'eclet\nNumber approximation of \\citet{Lign1999} to model the evolution of the\nperturbations. Our main findings are twofold. First, turbulence is not\nnecessarily generated whenever Zahn's nonlinear criterion \\citep{Zahn1974}\n$J{\\rm Pr} < (J{\\rm Pr})_c$ is satisfied, where $J=N^2/S^2$ is the local\ngradient Richardson number, ${\\rm Pr} = \\nu/ \\kappa_T$ is the Prandtl number,\nand $(J{\\rm Pr})_c \\simeq 0.007$. We have demonstrated that the presence or\nabsence of turbulent mixing in this limit hysteretically depends on the history\nof the shear layer. Second, Zahn's nonlinear instability criterion only\napproximately locates the edge of the turbulent layer, and mixing beyond the\nregion where $J{\\rm Pr} < (J{\\rm Pr})_c$ can also take place in a manner\nanalogous to convective overshoot. We found that the turbulent kinetic energy\ndecays roughly exponentially beyond the edge of the shear-unstable region, on a\nlengthscale $\\delta$ that is directly proportional to the scale of the\nturbulent eddies, which are themselves of the order of the Zahn scale (see Part\nI).

To alleviate this issue, we present a novel\nframework that generates segmentation labels of images given their image-level\nclass labels. In this weakly supervised setting, trained models have been known\nto segment local discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our\nsolution is to propagate such local responses to nearby areas which belong to\nthe same semantic entity. To this end, we propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN)\ncalled AffinityNet that predicts semantic affinity between a pair of adjacent\nimage coordinates. The semantic propagation is then realized by random walk\nwith the affinities predicted by AffinityNet. More importantly, the supervision\nemployed to train AffinityNet is given by the initial discriminative part\nsegmentation, which is incomplete as a segmentation annotation but sufficient\nfor learning semantic affinities within small image areas. Thus the entire\nframework relies only on image-level class labels and does not require any\nextra data or annotations.

This is more than standard software engineering: uncertainty pervades\nnot only sensors themselves, but the physical and digital environments in which\nthese systems operate. While we cannot engineer this uncertainty away, through\nthe use of models we can manage its impact in the design, development and\ndeployment of sensor network software. Our contribution consists of two new\nconcepts that improve the modelling process: frames of reference bringing\ntogether the different perspectives being modelled and their context; and the\nroles of different types of model in sensor-driven systems. In this position\npaper we develop these new concepts, illustrate their application to two\nexample systems, and describe some of the new research challenges involved in\nmodelling for assurance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 09:18:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 09:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Unlike turbulent wakes\nwhere such studies have already been carried out (Dairay et al. 2015; Obligado\net al. 2016), this is a boundary- free turbulent shear flow where the local\nReynolds number increases with distance from inlet. The Townsend-George theory\nrevised by Dairay et al. (2015) is applied to turbulent planar jets. Only a few\nprofiles need to be self-similar in this theory. The self- similarity of mean\nflow, turbulence dissipation, turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stress\nprofiles is supported by our experimental results from 18 to at least 54 nozzle\nsizes, the furthermost location investigated in this work. Furthermore, the\nnon-equilibrium dissipation scaling found in turbulent wakes, decaying\ngrid-generated turbulence, various instances of periodic turbulence and\nturbulent boundary layers (Vassilicos 2015, Dairay et al. 2015, Goto &\nVassilicos 2015, Nedic et al. 2017) is also observed in the present turbulent\nplanar jet and in the turbulent planar jet of Antonia et al.

A right linear operator is however only associated\nwith the right-multiplication and in certain settings, e.g. on Hilbert spaces,\nthe left-multiplication is not defined a priori but must be chosen randomly.\nSpectral properties of an operator should hence be independent of this left\nmultiplication.\n  We show that results derived from functional calculi for intrinsic slice\nfunctions can be formulated without the assumption of a left multiplication. We\ndevelop the S-functional calculus in this setting and a new approach to\nspectral integration. This approach has a clear interpretation in terms of the\nright linear structure on the space and allows to formulate the spectral\ntheorem without using any randomly chosen structure. Our techniques only apply\nto intrinsic slice functions, but only these functions are compatible with the\nbasic intuition of a functional calculus that $f(T)$ should be defined by\nletting $f$ act on the spectral values of $T$.\n  Using these tools, we develop a theory of quaternionic spectral operators. In\nparticular, we show the existence of a canonical decomposition of such operator\nand discuss its behavior under the S-functional calculus.\n  Finally, we show a relation with complex operator theory: if we embed the\ncomplex numbers into the quaternions, then complex and quaternionic operator\ntheory are consistent. The symmetry of intrinsic slice functions guarantees\nthat this compatibility is true for any imbedding of the complex numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 11:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

Originally it was introduced to assess the effect of\nbaseline biomarkers which do not vary over time. However, in many clinical\nsettings, measurements of biomarkers are repeated at fixed time points during\ntreatment exposure and, therefore, this method need to be extended. The purpose\nof this paper is then to extend the first step of the IDA, the Peter Clarks\n(PC)-algorithm, to a time-dependent exposure in the context of a binary\noutcome. We generalised the PC-algorithm for taking into account the\nchronological order of repeated measurements of the exposure and propose to\napply the IDA with our new version, the chronologically ordered PC-algorithm\n(COPC-algorithm).

The\nsimulation study showed that the completed partially directed acyclic graphs\n(CPDAGs) obtained using COPC-algorithm were structurally closer to the true\nCPDAG than CPDAGs obtained using PC-algorithm. Also, causal effects were more\naccurate when they were estimated based on CPDAGs obtained using\nCOPC-algorithm. Moreover, CPDAGs obtained by COPC-algorithm allowed removing\nnon-chronologic arrows with a variable measured at a time t pointing to a\nvariable measured at a time t' where t'< t. Bidirected edges were less present\nin CPDAGs obtained with the COPC-algorithm, supporting the fact that there was\nless variability in causal effects estimated from these CPDAGs.

We additionally present a\nmesh-morphing algorithm necessary to accommodate finite deformations to solve\nthe electromagnetic fields outside of the material body. We illustrate the use\nof the new formulation by developing an open-source implementation using the\nFEniCS package and applying this implementation to several engineering problems\nin electromagnetic structure interaction undergoing large deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 12:09:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 09:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

In particular we introduce a tractable model for\nembedding one network (A) into another (B), focusing on the case where network\nA has many more nodes than network B. In our model, nodes in network A are\nassigned, or embedded, to the nodes in network B using an assignment rule where\nthe extent of node localization is controlled by a single parameter. We start\nby mapping an unassigned `source' node in network A to a randomly chosen\n`target' node in network B.

We make progress on this, showing that certain spatial mixing\nconditions (notions of weak dependence on boundary conditions, not to be\nconfused with other notions of mixing in ergodic theory) imply ffiid. Our main\nresult is that weak spatial mixing implies ffiid with power-law tails for the\ncoding radius, and that strong spatial mixing implies ffiid with exponential\ntails for the coding radius.

Instead, one simply needs to derive the gradient of the log-posterior,\nwhich is often much easier. Yet for certain model classes, the log-posterior\nitself is difficult to optimize using standard gradient techniques. One such\nexample are random field models, where optimization based on gradient\nlinearization has proven popular, since it speeds up convergence significantly\nand can avoid poor local optima.

In neural networks\nwith injected noise, the method analytically takes into account uncertainties\nresulting from this noise. Such feed-forward analytic propagation is\ndifferentiable in parameters and can be trained end-to-end.

The printing plates were mounted on a rotating\nhorizontal cylinder that is half immersed in an aqueous solution of the anionic\nsurfactant sodium 1-decanesulfonate. The gravure plates and the presence of\nsurfactants serve as one example of a real-world dewetting situation. When\nrotating the cylinder, a liquid meniscus was partially drawn out of the liquid\nforming a dynamic contact angle at the contact line. The dynamic contact angle\nis decreased on a structured surface as compared to a smooth one. This is due\nto contact line pinning at the borders of the gravure cells. Additionally,\nsurfactants tend to decrease the dynamic receding contact angle. We consider\nthe interplay between these two effects. We compare the height differences of\nthe meniscus on the structured and unstructured area as function of dewetting\nspeeds. The height difference increases with increasing dewetting speed. With\nincreasing size of the gravure cells this height difference and the induced\nchanges in the dynamic contact angle increased. By adding surfactant, the\nheight difference and the changes in the contact angle for the same surface\ndecreased. We further note that although the liquid dewets the printing plates\nsome liquid is always left in the gravure cell. At high enough surfactant\nconcentrations or high enough dewetting speed, the dynamic contact angles in\nthe structured surface approach those in flat surfaces. We conclude that\nsurfactant reduces the influence of surface structure on dynamic dewetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 13:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 10:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

It modifies the geometrical\nstructure of manifold and relaxes the notion of affine connection being\nsymmetric. The theory is also called $U_4$ theory of gravitation; where the\nunderlying manifold is not Riemannian. The non-Riemannian part of the\nspace-time is sourced by the spin density of matter. Here mass and spin both\nplay the dynamical role. We consider the minimal coupling of Dirac field with\nEC theory; thereby calling the full theory as Einstein-Cartan-Dirac (ECD)\ntheory. In the recent works by T.P Singh titled \"A new length scale in quantum\ngravity\", the idea of new unified; mass dependent length scale $L_{cs}$ in\nquantum gravity has been proposed. We discuss this idea and formulate ECD\ntheory in both - standard length scales as well as this new length scale. We\nfound the non-relativistic limit of ECD theory using WKB-like expansion in\n$\\sqrt{\\hbar}/c$ of the ECD field equations with both the length scales. At\nleading order, ECD equations with standard length scales give\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-Newton equation. With $L_{cs}$, in the low mass limit, it gives\nsource-free Poisson equation and for higher mass limit, it reduces to Poisson\nequation with delta function source. Based on this, a falsifiable test of the\nidea of $L_{cs}$ has been proposed. Next, we formulate ECD theory with both the\nlength scales (especially the Dirac equation (Hehl-Datta equation) and\nContorsion spin coefficients) in Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. The idea of\n$L_{cs}$ suggests a symmetry between small and large masses. Formulating ECD\ntheory with $L_{cs}$ in NP formalism is desirable because NP formalism happens\nto be the common vocabulary for the description of low masses (Dirac theory)\nand high masses (gravity theories). A duality between Curvature and torsion has\nalso been discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 13:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 13:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

TypeState-Oriented Programming (TSOP) is a paradigm intended to help\ndevelopers in the implementation and use of mutable objects whose public\ninterface depends on their private state. Under this paradigm, well-typed\nprograms are guaranteed to conform with the protocol of the objects they use.\n  Inquiry. Previous works have investigated TSOP for both sequential and\nconcurrent objects. However, an important difference between the two settings\nstill remains. In a sequential setting, a well-typed program either progresses\nindefinitely or terminates eventually. In a concurrent setting, protocol\nconformance is no longer enough to avoid deadlocks, a situation in which the\nexecution of the program halts because two or more objects are involved in\nmutual dependencies that prevent any further progress.\n  Approach. In this work, we put forward a refinement of TSOP for concurrent\nobjects guaranteeing that well-typed programs not only conform with the\nprotocol of the objects they use, but are also deadlock free. The key\ningredients of the type system are behavioral types, used to specify and\nenforce object protocols, and dependency relations, used to represent abstract\ndescriptions of the dependencies between objects and detect circularities that\nmight cause deadlocks.\n  Knowledge. The proposed approach stands out for two features. First, the\napproach is fully compositional and therefore scalable: the objects of a large\nprogram can be type checked in isolation; deadlock freedom of an object\ncomposition solely depends on the types of the objects being composed; any\nmodification/refactoring of an object that does not affect its public interface\ndoes not affect other objects either. Second, we provide the first deadlock\nanalysis technique for join patterns, a high-level concurrency abstraction with\nwhich programmers can express complex synchronizations in a succinct and\ndeclarative form.\n  Grounding. We detail the proposed typing discipline for a core programming\nlanguage blending concurrent objects, asynchronous message passing and join\npatterns. We prove that the type system is sound and give non-trivial examples\nof programs that can be successfully analyzed. A Haskell implementation of the\ntype system that demonstrates the feasibility of the approach is publicly\navailable.\n  Importance. The static analysis technique described in this work can be used\nto certify programs written in a core language for concurrent TSOP with proven\ncorrectness guarantees. This is an essential first step towards the integration\nand application of the technique in a real-world developer toolchain, making\nprogramming of such systems more productive and less frustrating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 15:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

At modest\nvolume fractions, we show that inter-colloid attractions lead to clustering\nthat reduces the hinderance to settling imposed by fluid back flow. For\nsufficient attraction strength, increasing the particle concentration grows the\nparticle clusters, which further increases the mean settling rate in a physical\nmode termed promoted settling. The immersed boundary simulations are compared\nto recent experimental measurements of the settling rate in nanoparticle\ndispersions for which particles are driven to aggregate by short-ranged\ndepletion attractions. The simulations are able to quantitatively reproduce the\nexperimental results. We show that a simple, empirical model for the settling\nrate of adhesive hard sphere dispersions can be derived from a combination of\nthe experimental and computational data as well as analytical results valid in\ncertain asymptotic limits of the concentration and attraction strength.

Rather, the\nkinetics are inferred from ensemble measurements or the position of a\ntransducer (e.g. an AFM cantilever) as a surrogate variable. Direct\nvisualization is highly desirable. Here, we achieve the direct measurement of\nbarrier crossing trajectories by using optical microscopy to observe position\nand orientation changes of pairs of Ag nanoparticles in an optical ring trap,\ni.e. passing events. A two-step mechanism similar to a bimolecular exchange\nreaction is revealed by analysis that combines detailed knowledge of each\ntrajectory, a statistically significant number of repetitions of the passing\nevents, and the driving force-dependence of the process. We find that while the\ntotal event rate increases with driving force, this increase is only due to\nincreased rate of encounters. There is no drive force-dependence on the rate of\nbarrier crossing because the key motion for the process involves a radial\nmotion of one particle as a thermal (random) fluctuation allowing the other to\npass. This simple experiment can readily be extended to study more complex\nbarrier crossing processes by replacing the spherical metal nanoparticles with\nanisotropic ones or through more intricate optical trapping potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 15:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

Detection of radio emissions from them would help us to\nunderstand the scale-dependent particle acceleration mechanisms also groups can\nbe a unique laboratory to test the models of cosmic magnetism and canbe the\npotential source of WHIMs. So, we have modelled radio emissions from the\nsimulated structures using {\\sc{ENZO}}.

To alleviate this\nproblem, we employ an actor-critic framework to enhance the training procedure.\nFor the actor, we employ the typical attention based sequence-to-sequence\n(seq2seq) framework as the policy network for summary generation. For the\ncritic, we combine the maximum likelihood estimator with a well designed global\nsummary quality estimator which is a neural network based binary classifier\naiming to make the generated summaries indistinguishable from the human-written\nones. Policy gradient method is used to conduct the parameter learning. An\nalternating training strategy is proposed to conduct the joint training of the\nactor and critic models.

Among all scientific disciplines,\nprogramming holds a special place for two reasons. First, the artistic part is\nnot only undeniable but also essential. Second, and much like in a purely\nartistic discipline, the act of programming is driven partly by the notion of\naesthetics: the pleasure we have in creating beautiful things. Even though the\nimportance of aesthetics in the act of programming is now unquestioned, more\ncould still be written on the subject. The field called \"psychology of\nprogramming\" focuses on the cognitive aspects of the activity, with the goal of\nimproving the productivity of programmers. While many scientists have\nemphasized their concern for aesthetics and the impact it has on their\nactivity, few computer scientists have actually written about their thought\nprocess while programming. What makes us like or dislike such and such language\nor paradigm? Why do we shape our programs the way we do? By answering these\nquestions from the angle of aesthetics, we may be able to shed some new light\non the art of programming. Starting from the assumption that aesthetics is an\ninherently transversal dimension, it should be possible for every programmer to\nfind the same aesthetic driving force in every creative activity they\nundertake, not just programming, and in doing so, get deeper insight on why and\nhow they do things the way they do. On the other hand, because our aesthetic\nsensitivities are so personal, all we can really do is relate our own\nexperiences and share it with others, in the hope that it will inspire them to\ndo the same. My personal life has been revolving around three major creative\nactivities, of equal importance: programming in Lisp, playing Jazz music, and\npracticing Aikido. But why so many of them, why so different ones, and why\nthese specifically? By introspecting my personal aesthetic sensitivities, I\neventually realized that my tastes in the scientific, artistic, and physical\ndomains are all motivated by the same driving forces, hence unifying Lisp,\nJazz, and Aikido as three expressions of a single essence, not so different\nafter all. Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are governed by a limited set of rules which\nremain simple and unobtrusive. Conforming to them is a pleasure. Because Lisp,\nJazz, and Aikido are inherently introspective disciplines, they also invite you\nto transgress the rules in order to find your own. Breaking the rules is fun.\nFinally, if Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido unify so many paradigms, styles, or\ntechniques, it is not by mere accumulation but because they live at the\nmeta-level and let you reinvent them. Working at the meta-level is an\nenlightening experience. Understand your aesthetic sensitivities and you may\ngain considerable insight on your own psychology of programming. Mine is\nperhaps common to most lispers. Perhaps also common to other programming\ncommunities, but that, is for the reader to decide...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 17:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

A few researches have focused on improving TEG\nefficiency at the system level on vehicle radiators. The most recent\nreconfiguration algorithm shows improvement in performance but suffers from\nmajor drawback on computational time and energy overhead, and non-scalability\nin terms of array size and processing frequency. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel TEG array reconfiguration algorithm that determines near-optimal\nconfiguration with an acceptable computational time. More precisely, with\n$O(N)$ time complexity, our prediction-based fast TEG reconfiguration algorithm\nenables all modules to work at or near their maximum power points (MPP).\nAdditionally, we incorporate prediction methods to further reduce the runtime\nand switching overhead during the reconfiguration process. Experimental results\npresent $30\\%$ performance improvement, almost $100\\times$ reduction on\nswitching overhead and $13\\times$ enhancement on computational speed compared\nto the baseline and prior work. The scalability of our algorithm makes it\napplicable to larger scale systems such as industrial boilers and heat\nexchangers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 14:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}

Two primary causes of such latency include:\n(1) the compulsory erasing stage along with the writing stage and (2) the major\ndifference in data width between the RAM-based CAM (e.g., 8-bit width) and the\nmodern systems (e.g., 256-bit width). This brief, therefore, aims for an\nefficient input/output (I/O) architecture of RAM-based binary CAM (RCAM) for\nlow-latency update. To achieve this goal, three techniques, namely centralized\nerase RAM, bit-sliced, and hierarchical-partitioning, are proposed to eliminate\nthe latency of erasing stage, as well as to allow RCAM to exploit the bandwidth\nof modern systems effectively. Several RCAMs, whose data width ranges from 8\nbits to 64 bits, were integrated into a 256-bit system for the evaluation. The\nexperimental results in an Intel Arria V 5ASTFD5 FPGA prove that at 100 MHz,\nthe proposed designs achieve at least 9.6 times higher I/O efficiency as\ncompared to the traditional RCAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 02:14:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 23:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

Polylactide\nor polycaprolactone scaffolds with pore sizes ranging between 200-500 {\\mu}m\nand hydroxyapatite contents up to 70 wt % were fabricated. Compressive tests\nrevealed an anisotropic behavior of the scaffolds, strongly dependent on their\nchemical composition.

The mechanical properties of hybrid scaffolds\ndid not degrade significantly after 20 days in simulated body fluid.
