Our multipolar\nwaveform model incorporates recent (resummed) post-Newtonian results for the\ninspiral and information from 157 numerical-relativity simulations, and 13\nwaveforms from black-hole perturbation theory for the (plunge-)merger and\nringdown. We quantify the improved accuracy including higher-order modes by\ncomputing the faithfulness of the waveform model against the\nnumerical-relativity waveforms used to construct the model. We define the\nfaithfulness as the match maximized over time, phase of arrival,\ngravitational-wave polarization and sky position of the waveform model, and\naveraged over binary orientation, gravitational-wave polarization and sky\nposition of the numerical-relativity waveform.

Such diagnostics are accomplished by applying high\nvoltage to six electrodes, which are grounded in normal operation to form part\nof the Faraday shield. Our measurements place a constraint on the DC Stark\nshift at the $10^{-20}$ level, in units of the clock frequency. Moreover, we\ndiscuss a potential source of error in strategies to precisely measure or\ncancel non-zero DC Stark shifts, attributed to field gradients coupled with the\nfinite spatial extent of the lattice-trapped atoms. With this consideration, we\nfind that Faraday shielding, complemented with experimental validation,\nprovides both a practically appealing and effective solution to the problem of\nDC Stark shifts in optical lattice clocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 17:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

An obvious requirement for handling partially observed\ntasks is access to extensive memory, but we show memory is not enough; it is\ncritical that the right information be stored in the right format. We develop a\nmodel, the Memory, RL, and Inference Network (MERLIN), in which memory\nformation is guided by a process of predictive modeling.

A related question is\nwhether the IMF is in fact universal across galactic environments, a galactic\ninitial mass function (IGIMF), or whether it is an average of local IMFs. One\nof the long-standing problems in resolving this question and in the study of\nyoung clusters is observational: the emission from multiple sources is\nfrequently seen as blended because at different wavelengths or with different\ntelescopes the beam sizes are different. The confusion hinders our ability to\nfully characterize clustered star formation. Here we present a new method that\nuses a genetic algorithm and Bayesian inference to fit the blended SEDs and\nimages of individual YSOs in confused clusters. We apply this method to the\ninfrared photometry of a sample comprising 70 Spitzer-selected, low-mass\n($M_{\\rm{cl}}<100~\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$) young clusters in the galactic plane, and\nuse the derived physical parameters to investigate the distributions of masses\nand evolutionary stages of clustered YSOs, and the implications of those\ndistributions for studies of the IMF and the different models of star\nformation.

However, such analyses involve evaluating\nthe classifier using datapoints that may be atypical of its training\ndistribution. Standard methods for training classifiers that minimize empirical\nrisk do not constrain the behavior of the classifier on such datapoints. As a\nresult, training to minimize empirical risk does not distinguish among\nclassifiers that agree on predictions in the training distribution but have\nwildly different causal influences. We term this problem covariate shift in\ncausal testing and formally characterize conditions under which it arises. As a\nsolution to this problem, we propose a novel active learning algorithm that\nconstrains the influence measures of the trained model. We prove that any two\npredictors whose errors are close on both the original training distribution\nand the distribution of atypical points are guaranteed to have causal\ninfluences that are also close. Further, we empirically demonstrate with\nsynthetic labelers that our algorithm trains models that (i) have similar\ncausal influences as the labeler's model, and (ii) generalize better to\nout-of-distribution points while (iii) retaining their accuracy on\nin-distribution points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 19:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2018 23:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

This so-called Zipf's law has been\nreported before. We first show this correlation in results from recent\nelections in Germany, France and republican primaries in the USA. However the\nmechanism generating such feature remains so far unexplained. We develop a\nmathematical model of voter grouping that is only based on the word of mouth\nand not on political contents. The model is close to the infinite allele model\nand the Ewens sampling formula that are well known in population genetics.\nStrikingly, the model generates output agreeing very well with the observed\nelection data. We further identify a cannibalism effect in Germany, whereby\nparties above the 5% threshold withdraw votes from parties just below the\nthreshold. We demonstrate that the number of parties present in the parliament\ncan be predicted given the number of parties standing for election. Finally,\nthe steady loss of big-tent parties in Germany in the last 20 years relates to\nthe increasing number of parties since 1975. We discuss the interpretation and\nconsequences of these findings for modern democracies and the rationality or\nlack thereof of voters' choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 21:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

We show that\nthey are initially endowed with angular momentum that significantly exceeds the\nmass-shedding limit for rigidly-rotating equilibria. We find that\ngravitational-wave (GW) emission is not able to remove this excess angular\nmomentum within the time over which solid body rotation should be achieved.\nInstead, we argue that the excess angular momentum could be carried away by\nmassive winds. Long-lived merger remnants are also formed with larger\ngravitational masses than those of rigidly-rotating NSs having the same number\nof baryons. The excess mass is likely radiated in the form of neutrinos. The\nevolution of long-lived remnants on the viscous timescale is thus determined by\nthe interplay of finite-temperature effects, mass ejection, and neutrinos with\npotentially dramatic consequences for the remnants' properties and stability.\nWe also provide an empirical fit for the spin of the remnant at the end of its\nviscous evolution as a function of its final mass, and we discuss the\nimplications for the magnetar model of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs).

Several binary coding based methods have been proposed for efficient\nReID, which either learn projections to map high-dimensional features to\ncompact binary codes, or directly adopt deep neural networks by simply\ninserting an additional fully-connected layer with tanh-like activations.\nHowever, the former approach requires time-consuming hand-crafted feature\nextraction and complicated (discrete) optimizations; the latter lacks the\nnecessary discriminative information greatly due to the straightforward\nactivation functions.

For\nthis beamforming, we propose to use differential beamformers as they are more\nsuitable for speech separation. Then each beamformed signal is fed into a\nsingle-channel anchored deep attractor network to generate separated signals.\nAnd the final separation is acquired by post selecting the separating output\nfor each beams.

As analogous to supernovae and supernova remnants,\nthe NSM dynamical ejecta are expected to produce non-thermal emission by\nelectrons accelerated at a shock wave. In this paper, we present expected radio\nand X-ray signals by this mechanism, taking into account non-linear diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA) and magnetic field amplification. We suggest that the\nNSM has a unique nature as a DSA site, where the seed relativistic electrons\nare abundantly provided by the decays of r-process elements. The signal is\npredicted to peak at a few 100 - 1,000 days after the merger, determined by the\nbalance between the decrease of the number of seed electrons and the increase\nof the dissipated kinetic energy due to the shock expansion. While the\nresulting flux can ideally reach to the maximum flux expected from\nnear-equipartition, the available kinetic energy dissipation rate of the NSM\nejecta limits the detectability of such a signal. It is likely that the radio\nand X-ray emission are overwhelmed by other mechanisms (e.g., an off-axis jet)\nfor an observer placed to a jet direction (i.e., for GW170817). On the other\nhand, for an off-axis observer, to be discovered once a number of NSMs are\nidentified, the dynamical ejecta component is predicted to dominate the\nnon-thermal emission. While the detection of this signal is challenging even\nwith near-future facilities, this potentially provides a robust probe of the\ncreation of r-process elements in NSMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 05:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

This new order property is an orientation\ncorrelation between the relative position and the relative velocity of any\nparticle pair, which weakens the collision frequency and leads a long range\nboundary effect. By the histogram of the relative position and the relative\nvelocity, we find this position-velocity correlation is not only at limits of\nvery small relative velocities but also large ones, which means the breakdown\nof molecular chaos assumption is not limited to a small portion of the phase\nspace. Through a simple anisotropic angular distribution model of the relative\nposition and the relative velocity, we could modify classical uniform angular\nintegration results of mean field values taking the effect of the observed\ncollision chain structure explicitly into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Massive data loss is so common that there\nis a great demand for data recovery. While data recovery methods fulfil the\nrequirement of accuracy, the potential privacy leakage caused by them concerns\nus a lot. Thus the major challenge of sensory data recovery is the issue of\neffective privacy preservation. Existing algorithms can either accomplish\naccurate data recovery or solve privacy issue, yet no single design is able to\naddress these two problems simultaneously. Therefore in this paper, we propose\na novel approach Privacy-Preserving Compressive Sensing with Multi-Attribute\nAssistance (PPCS-MAA). It applies PPCS scheme to sensory data recovery, which\ncan effectively encrypts sensory data without decreasing accuracy, because it\nmaintains the homomorphic obfuscation property for compressive sensing. In\naddition, multiple environmental attributes from sensory datasets usually have\nstrong correlation so that we design a MultiAttribute Assistance (MAA)\ncomponent to leverage this feature for better recovery accuracy. Combining PPCS\nwith MAA, the novel recovery scheme can provide reliable privacy with high\naccuracy. Firstly, based on two real datasets, IntelLab and GreenOrbs, we\nreveal the inherited low-rank features as the ground truth and find such\nmulti-attribute correlation. Secondly, we develop a PPCS-MAA algorithm to\npreserve privacy and optimize the recovery accuracy. Thirdly, the results of\nreal data-driven simulations show that the algorithm outperforms the existing\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

The Sobol index is one of the most\nwidely used sensitivity indices for models with independent inputs. For models\nwith dependent inputs, different approaches have been explored to obtain\nsensitivity indices in the literature. Typical approaches are based on\nprocedures of transforming the dependent inputs into independent inputs.\nHowever, such transformation requires additional information about the inputs,\nsuch as the dependency structure or the conditional probability density\nfunctions. In this paper, data-driven sensitivity indices are proposed for\nmodels with dependent inputs. We first construct ordered partitions of linearly\nindependent polynomials of the inputs. The modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm is\nthen applied to the ordered partitions to generate orthogonal polynomials with\nrespect to the empirical measure based on observed data of model inputs and\noutputs. Using the polynomial chaos expansion with the orthogonal polynomials,\nwe obtain the proposed data-driven sensitivity indices. The sensitivity indices\nprovide intuitive interpretations of how the dependent inputs affect the\nvariance of the output without a priori knowledge on the dependence structure\nof the inputs. Three numerical examples are used to validate the proposed\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 09:26:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 19:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 08:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Actin filaments are employed as an experimental model\nsystem and their conformations are investigated through fluorescence microscopy\nin microfluidic channels. Simulations matching the experimental conditions are\nalso performed using inextensible Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and non-local\nslender-body hydrodynamics in the presence of thermal fluctuations, and agree\nquantitatively with observations. We demonstrate that filament dynamics in this\nsystem is primarily governed by a dimensionless elasto-viscous number comparing\nviscous drag forces to elastic bending forces, with thermal fluctuations only\nplaying a secondary role. While short and rigid filaments perform\nquasi-periodic tumbling motions, a buckling instability arises above a critical\nflow strength. A second transition to strongly-deformed shapes occurs at a yet\nlarger value of the elasto-viscous number and is characterized by the\nappearance of localized high-curvature bends that propagate along the filaments\nin apparent \"snaking\" motions. A theoretical model for the so far unexplored\nonset of snaking accurately predicts the transition and explains the observed\ndynamics. For the first time, we present a complete characterization of\nfilament morphologies and transitions as a function of elasto-viscous number\nand scaled persistence length and demonstrate excellent agreement between\ntheory, experiments and simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 09:33:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 04:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

The Winograd family of algorithms can greatly\nreduce the number of arithmetic operations required and is present in many DNN\nsoftware frameworks. However, the performance gain is at the expense of a\nreduction in floating point (FP) numerical accuracy. In this paper, we analyse\nthe worst case FP error and prove the estimation of norm and conditioning of\nthe algorithm. We show that the bound grows exponentially with the size of the\nconvolution, but the error bound of the \\textit{modified} algorithm is smaller\nthan the original one. We propose several methods for reducing FP error. We\npropose a canonical evaluation ordering based on Huffman coding that reduces\nsummation error. We study the selection of sampling \"points\" experimentally and\nfind empirically good points for the most important sizes. We identify the main\nfactors associated with good points. In addition, we explore other methods to\nreduce FP error, including mixed-precision convolution, and pairwise summation\nacross DNN channels. Using our methods we can significantly reduce FP error for\na given block size, which allows larger block sizes and reduced computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 09:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 17:32:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 19:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

The underlying unperturbed model investigated is an\nintegrable, separable, 2 degrees of freedom mechanical impact system with\neffectively bounded energy level sets and a single straight wall which\npreserves the separable structure. Singularities in the system appear either as\ntrajectories with tangent impacts or as singularities in the underlying\nHamiltonian structure (e.g. separatrices). It is shown that away from these\nsingularities, a small perturbation from the integrable structure results in\nsmooth near integrable behavior. Such a perturbation may occur from a small\ndeformation or tilt of the wall which breaks the separability upon impact, the\naddition of a small regular perturbation to the system, or the combination of\nboth. In some simple cases explicit formulae to the leading order term in the\nnear integrable return map are derived. Near integrability is also shown to\npersist when the hard billiard boundary is replaced by a singular, smooth,\nsteep potential, thus extending the near-integrability results beyond the scope\nof regular perturbations. These systems constitute an additional class of\nexamples of near integrable impact systems, beyond the traditional one\ndimensional oscillating billiards, nearly elliptic billiards, and the\nnear-integrable behavior near the boundary of convex smooth billiards with or\nwithout magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 09:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

Although density estimation is a common task, the adequacy\nof approximation methods (surrogate models) for density estimation has not been\nanalyzed before in the uncertainty-quantification (UQ) literature. In this\npaper, we first show that standard surrogate models (such as generalized\npolynomial chaos), which are highly accurate for moment estimation, might\ncompletely fail to approximate the PDF, even for one-dimensional noise. This is\nbecause density estimation requires that the surrogate model accurately\napproximates the gradient of the quantity of interest, and not just the\nquantity of interest itself. Hence, we develop a novel spline-based algorithm\nfor density-estimation whose convergence rate in $L^q$ is polynomial in the\nsampling resolution. This convergence rate is better than that of standard\nstatistical density-estimation methods (such as histograms and kernel density\nestimators) at dimensions $1 \\leq d\\leq \\frac{5}{2}m$, where $m$ is the spline\norder. Furthermore, we obtain the convergence rate for density estimation with\nany surrogate model that approximates the quantity of interest and its gradient\nin $L^{\\infty}$.

However, distribution of\npredicted angles would not be similar to that of real angles. To address this\nwe employed generative adversarial networks (GAN). Generative adversarial\nnetworks are composed of two adversarially trained networks: a discriminator\nand a generator. A discriminator distinguishes samples from a dataset and\ngenerated samples while a generator generates realistic samples. Although the\ndiscriminator of GANs is trained to estimate density, GAN model is intractable.\nOn the other hand, noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) was introduced to\nestimate a normalization constant of an unnormalized statistical model and thus\nthe density function. In this thesis, we introduce noise-contrastive estimation\ngenerative adversarial networks (NCE-GAN) which enables explicit density\nestimation of a GAN model.

Via\ninformation geometry, we will see that CVB algorithm iteratively projects the\noriginal joint distribution to a copula constraint space until it reaches a\nlocal minimum Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.

Second, we simulated\nvaccinating 10% of each village at baseline, selecting vaccinees using 1 of 5\nnetwork-based approaches: at random (Random); random contacts of random\nindividuals (Nomination); random high-degree individuals (High Degree); highest\ndegree (Highest Degree); or most central (Central).

We use normalized mutual\ninformation to compare individual objects of a clustering ensemble to the\nconstructed consensus of the whole ensemble and show, that the resulting score\ncan serve as an overall quality measure for clustering problems. This method is\ncapable of highlighting the standout clustering and hyperparameter\nconfiguration in the ensemble even in the case of a distorted consensus. We\napply this very general framework to various data sets and give possible\ndirections for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 11:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

It plays important roles in network\nsecurity and management. But how to detect them in real time from nowadays\nhigh-speed network which contains several distributed routers is a hard task.\nDistributed sliding super point detection requires an algorithm that can\nestimate the number of contacting hosts incrementally, scan packets faster than\ntheir flowing speed and reconstruct sliding super point at the end of a time\nperiod. But no existing algorithm satisfies these three requirements\nsimultaneously. To solve this problem, this paper firstly proposed a\ndistributed sliding super point detection algorithm running on GPU. The\nadvantage of this algorithm comes from a novel sliding estimator, which can\nestimate contacting host number incrementally under a sliding window, and a set\nof reversible hash functions, by which sliding super points could be regained\nwithout storing additional data such as IP list. There are two main procedures\nin this algorithm: packets scanning and sliding super points reconstruction.\nBoth could run parallel without any data reading conflict.

A real world core network traffic is used to evaluate the performance\nof this sliding super point detection algorithm on a cheap GPU, Nvidia GTX950\nwith 4 GB graphic memory. Experiments comparing with other algorithms under\ndiscrete time window show that this algorithm has the highest accuracy. Under\nsliding time widow, this algorithm has the same performance as in discrete time\nwindow, where no other algorithms can work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 12:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

Currently, the\nstandard technique for probing CEF excitations in lanthanides is inelastic\nneutron scattering. Here we show that with the recent leap in energy\nresolution, resonant inelastic soft X-ray scattering has become a serious\nalternative for looking at CEF excitations with some distinct advantages\ncompared to INS. As an example we study the CEF scheme in CeRh2Si2, a system\nthat has been intensely studied for more than two decades now but for which no\nconsensus has been reached yet as to its CEF scheme.

The result agrees well with previous INS\nand magnetic susceptibility measurements. Due to its strong resonant character,\nRIXS is applicable to very small samples, presents very high cross sections for\nall lanthanides, and further benefits from the very weak coupling to phonon\nexcitation. The rapid progress in energy resolution of RIXS spectrometers is\nmaking this technique increasingly attractive for the investigation of the CEF\nscheme in lanthanides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 13:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-06"}

Viewing the\ninvariants as multiplication operators $\\hat p_i$ on the Hilbert space\n$\\mathcal H$, the union of their images defines a subspace of $\\mathcal H$\nwhose orthogonal complement $\\mathcal H_\\tau$ is the element of the\ncostratification corresponding to $\\tau$. To construct $\\mathcal H_\\tau$, one\nhas to determine the images of the $\\hat p_i$ explicitly. To accomplish that\ngoal, we construct an orthonormal basis in $\\mathcal H$ and determine the\nmultiplication law for the basis elements, that is, we determine the structure\nconstants of $\\mathcal R$ in this basis. This part of our analysis applies to\nany compact Lie group $G$. For $G = \\mathrm{SU}(2)$, the above procedure boils\ndown to a problem in combinatorics of angular momentum theory. Using this\ntheory, we obtain the union of the images of the operators $\\hat p_i$ as a\nsubspace generated by vectors whose coefficients with respect to our basis are\ngiven in terms of Wigner's $3nj$ symbols. The latter are further expressed in\nterms of $9j$ symbols. Using these techniques, we are also able to reduce the\neigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian of this theory to a problem in linear\nalgebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 16:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

We used\nlarge overlapping image patches as inputs for intrinsic and extrinsic data\naugmentation, a patch selection algorithm, and a patch prediction fusion\nstrategy using B-spline weighted soft voting to account for the uncertainty of\nprediction in patch borders. We applied this method to MS lesion segmentation\nbased on two different datasets of MSSEG and ISBI longitudinal MS lesion\nsegmentation challenge, where we achieved top performance in both challenges.\nOur network trained with focal loss ranked first according to the ISBI\nchallenge overall score and resulted in the lowest reported lesion false\npositive rate among all submitted methods.

In terms of how to dynamically adjust traffic signals'\nduration, existing works either split the traffic signal into equal duration or\nextract limited traffic information from the real data. In this paper, we study\nhow to decide the traffic signals' duration based on the collected data from\ndifferent sensors and vehicular networks. We propose a deep reinforcement\nlearning model to control the traffic light. In the model, we quantify the\ncomplex traffic scenario as states by collecting data and dividing the whole\nintersection into small grids. The timing changes of a traffic light are the\nactions, which are modeled as a high-dimension Markov decision process. The\nreward is the cumulative waiting time difference between two cycles. To solve\nthe model, a convolutional neural network is employed to map the states to\nrewards. The proposed model is composed of several components to improve the\nperformance, such as dueling network, target network, double Q-learning\nnetwork, and prioritized experience replay.

The global sample shows that the\nbimodality of chromospheric activity, known as the Vaughan-Preston gap, is not\nprominent, with a significant percentage of the stars at an\nintermediate-activity level around log R'HK = -4.75. Independently, the cycle\nperiod search shows that stars can lie in the region intermediate between the\nactive and inactive branch, which means that the active branch is not as\nclearly distinct as previously thought. The weakening of the Vaughan-Preston\ngap indicates that cool stars spin down from a higher activity level and settle\nat a lower activity level without a sudden break at intermediate activity.

Its performance is characterized by the\nstate evolution (SE) which is a simple scalar recursion. However, depending on\na measurement matrix ensemble, AMP may face a convergence problem. To avoid\nthis problem, orthogonal AMP (OAMP), which uses de-correlation linear\nestimation and divergence-free non-linear estimation, was proposed by Ma and\nPing. They also provide the SE analysis for OAMP. In their SE analysis, the\nfollowing two assumptions were made: (i) The estimated vector of the\nde-correlation linear estimator consists of i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian entries\nindependent of the vector to be estimated and (ii) the estimated vector of the\ndivergence-free non-linear estimator consists of i.i.d. entries independent of\nthe measurement matrix and the noise vector.
