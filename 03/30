To support the high-mobility sensing with low network latency, a\ntechnique called over-the-air-computation (AirComp) was recently developed\nwhich enables an access-point to receive a desired function of sensing-data\nfrom concurrent-transmissions by exploiting the superposition property of a\nmulti-access-channel. This work aims at further developing AirComp for\nnext-generation multi-antenna multi-modal sensor networks. Specifically, we\ndesign beamforming and channel-feedback techniques for multi-function AirComp.\nGiven the objective of minimizing sum-mean-squared-error of computed functions,\nthe optimization of receive-beamforming for multi-function AirComp is a NP-hard\nproblem. The approximate problem based on tightening transmission-power\nconstraints, however, is shown to be solvable using differential-geometry. The\nsolution is proved to be the weighted-centroid of points on a\nGrassmann-manifold, where each point represents the subspace spanned by the\nchannel matrix of a sensor. As a by-product, the beamforming problem is found\nto have the same form as the classic problem of multicast-beamforming,\nestablishing the AirComp-multicasting-duality. Its significance lies in making\nthe said Grassmannian-centroid solution transferable to the latter problem\nwhich otherwise is solved using the computation-intensive\nsemidefinite-relaxation-technique. Last, building on the AirComp-beamforming\nsolution, an efficient channel-feedback technique is designed for an\naccess-point to receive the beamformer from distributed sensor transmissions of\ndesigned signals that are functions of local channel-state-information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 16:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 03:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

However, current benchmarks studies\nin existing deep learning frameworks (for example, Caffe, Tensorflow, Torch and\nothers) are based on performance of these applications on high-end CPUs and\nGPUs.

In this paper we show that the application of\nFloquet's theory to Lindblad dynamics offers clear answers to both questions.\nBy moving to a generalized rotating frame, we show that it is possible to\nidentify a single object, the Floquet Liouvillian, which encompasses all\noperating properties of the engine. First, its spectrum dictates the\nconvergence to a limit cycle. And second, the state within the limit cycle is\nprecisely its zero eigenstate, therefore reducing the problem to that of\ndetermining the steady-state of a time-independent master equation. To\nillustrate the usefulness of this theory, we apply it to a harmonic oscillator\nsubject to a time-periodic work protocol and time-periodic dissipation, an\nopen-system generalization of the Ermakov-Lewis theory. The use of this theory\nto implement a finite-time Carnot engine subject to continuous frequency\nmodulations is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 17:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 16:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

It\nhas been recently discovered that in the Higgs branch of $5d$ and $6d$ SQCD\ntheories with eight supercharges, the new massless states, arising when the\ngauge coupling is taken to infinity, can be described in terms of Coulomb\nbranches of $3d ~\\mathcal N=4$ quiver gauge theories. The description of this\nnew phenomenon draws from the ideas discovered in the analysis of nilpotent\norbits as Higgs and Coulomb branches of $3d$ theories and promotes the Higgs\nmechanism known as the Kraft-Procesi transition to the status of a new\noperation between quivers. This is the quiver subtraction. This paper\nestablishes this operation formally and examines some immediate consequences.\nOne is the extension of the physical realization of Kraft-Procesi transitions\nfrom the classical to the exceptional Lie algebras. Another result is the\nextension from special nilpotent orbits to non-special ones. One further\nconsequence is the analysis of the effect in $5d ~\\mathcal N=1$ SQCD of\nintegrating out a massive quark while the gauge coupling remains infinite. In\ngeneral, the subtraction of quivers sheds light on the different types of\nsingularities within the Coulomb branch and the structure of the massless\nstates that arise at those singular points; including the nature of the new\nHiggs branches that open up. This allows for a systematic analysis of mixed\nbranches of $3d ~\\mathcal N=4$ quivers that do not necessarily have a simple\nembedding in string theory. The subtraction of two quivers is an extremely\nsimple resource for the theoretical physicist interested in the vacuum\nstructure of gauge theories, and yet its power is so remarkable that is bound\nto play a crucial role in the coming discoveries of new and exciting physics in\n$5$ and $6$ dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 18:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

The seminal\nresult of Attiya, Bar-Noy, and Dolev established that two pairs of\ncommunication exchanges, or equivalently two round-trip communications, are\nsufficient. Subsequent research examined the possibility of implementations\nthat involve less than four exchanges. The work of Dutta et al. showed that for\nsingle-writer/multiple-reader (SWMR) settings two exchanges are sufficient,\nprovided that the number of readers is severely constrained with respect to the\nnumber of object replicas in the system and the number of replica failures, and\nalso showed that no two exchange implementations of\nmultiple-writer/multiple-reader (MWMR) objects are possible.

This improves on prior works where read\noperations took either (a) three exchanges, or (b) two or four exchanges. The\nnumber of readers in the new algorithms is unconstrained, and write operations\ntake the same number of exchanges as in prior work (two for SWMR and four for\nMWMR settings).

However, the MLE may exist in the\ncompletion of the exponential family. Existing algorithms for finding the MLE\nin the completion solve many linear programs; they are slow in small problems\nand too slow for large problems. We provide new, fast, and scalable methodology\nfor finding the MLE in the completion of the exponential family. This\nmethodology is based on conventional maximum likelihood computations which come\nclose, in a sense, to finding the MLE in the completion of the exponential\nfamily. These conventional computations construct a likelihood maximizing\nsequence of canonical parameter values which goes uphill on the likelihood\nfunction until they meet a convergence criteria. Nonexistence of the MLE in\nthis context results from a degeneracy of the canonical statistic of the\nexponential family, the canonical statistic is on the boundary of its support.\nThere is a correspondance between this boundary and the null eigenvectors of\nthe Fisher information matrix. Convergence of Fisher information along a\nlikelihood maximizing sequence follows from cumulant generating function (CGF)\nconvergence along a likelihood maximizing sequence, conditions for which are\ngiven. This allows for the construction of necessarily one-sided confidence\nintervals for mean value parameters when the MLE exists in the completion.

Our overall detection rate is 18%, including four new\ndetections, among which are the first three around Sun-like stars and the first\ntwo around stars without any previously known circumstellar dust. The inferred\noccurrence rates are comparable for early type and Sun-like stars, but decrease\nfrom 60 (+16/-21)% for stars with previously detected cold dust to 8 (+10/-3)%\nfor stars without such excess, confirming earlier results at higher\nsensitivity. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity is\nfive to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal excess\nluminosity function, we put upper limits on the median HZ dust level of 13\nzodis (95% confidence) for a sample of stars without cold dust and of 26 zodis\nwhen focussing on Sun-like stars without cold dust.

The interplay of precision measurement and\nquantum many-body physics is beginning to foster an exciting scientific\nfrontier with many opportunities. Few particle systems provide a window to view\nthe emergence of complex many-body phenomena arising from pairwise\ninteractions. Here, we create arrays of isolated few-body systems in a\nfermionic ${}^{87}$Sr three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice clock and use high\nresolution clock spectroscopy to directly observe the onset of both elastic and\ninelastic multi-body interactions. These interactions cannot be broken down\ninto sums over the underlying pairwise interactions. We measure\nparticle-number-dependent frequency shifts of the clock transition for atom\nnumbers $n$ ranging from 1 to 5, and observe nonlinear interaction shifts,\nwhich are characteristic of SU($N$)-symmetric elastic multi-body effects. To\nstudy inelastic multi-body effects, we use these frequency shifts to isolate\n$n$-occupied sites and measure the corresponding lifetimes.

In addition, POMDP provides a general\nmodeling framework for sequential decision making where states are hidden and\nactions have stochastic outcomes.

Yet pancreas\nis a challenging abdominal organ to segment due to the high inter-patient\nanatomical variability in both shape and volume metrics. Recently,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated promising performance on\naccurate segmentation of pancreas. However, the CNN-based method often suffers\nfrom segmentation discontinuity for reasons such as noisy image quality and\nblurry pancreatic boundary. From this point, we propose to introduce recurrent\nneural networks (RNNs) to address the problem of spatial non-smoothness of\ninter-slice pancreas segmentation across adjacent image slices. To inference\ninitial segmentation, we first train a 2D CNN sub-network, where we modify its\nnetwork architecture with deep-supervision and multi-scale feature map\naggregation so that it can be trained from scratch with small-sized training\ndata and presents superior performance than transferred models. Thereafter, the\nsuccessive CNN outputs are processed by another RNN sub-network, which refines\nthe consistency of segmented shapes. More specifically, the RNN sub-network\nconsists convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) units in both top-down\nand bottom-up directions, which regularizes the segmentation of an image by\nintegrating predictions of its neighboring slices. We train the stacked CNN-RNN\nmodel end-to-end and perform quantitative evaluations on both CT and MRI\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 01:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-02"}

We have chosen to reframe the problem of intracavity Rayleigh\nscattering by considering the optical ring resonator as an infinitely-long,\none-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) that possesses a lattice constant equal\nto the perimeter of the ring.

Such data processing needs can be modeled as a streaming\ncomputation. A streaming computation is specified as a dataflow graph that\nexposes multiple opportunities for parallelizing its execution, in the form of\ndata, pipeline and task parallelism. On the other hand, many important\napplications require that processing of the stream be ordered, where inputs are\nprocessed in the same order as they arrive. There is a fundamental conflict\nbetween ordered processing and parallelizing the streaming computation. This\npaper focuses on the problem of effectively parallelizing ordered streaming\ncomputations on a shared-memory multicore machine.\n  We first address the key challenges in exploiting data parallelism in the\nordered setting. We present a low-latency, non-blocking concurrent data\nstructure to order outputs produced by concurrent workers on an operator. We\nalso propose a new approach to parallelizing partitioned stateful operators\nthat can handle load imbalance across partitions effectively and mostly avoid\ndelays due to ordering. We illustrate the trade-offs and effectiveness of our\nconcurrent data-structures on micro-benchmarks and streaming queries from the\nTPCx-BB benchmark. We then present an adaptive runtime that dynamically maps\nthe exposed parallelism in the computation to that of the machine. We propose\nseveral intuitive scheduling heuristics and compare them empirically on the\nTPCx-BB queries. We find that for streaming computations, heuristics that\nexploit as much pipeline parallelism as possible perform better than those that\nseek to exploit data parallelism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 03:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-02"}

The generic multiphysics problem is modeled as a\nsystem of n systems of partial differential equations where the ith subsystem\nis coupled to the other subsystems through a coupling term that can depend on\nthe state of all the other subsystems. This coupled system of partial\ndifferential equations reduces to a coupled system of ordinary differential\nequations via the method of lines where an appropriate spatial discretization\nis applied to each subsystem. The coupled system of ordinary differential\nequations is taken as a monolithic system and discretized using an IMEX-RK\ndiscretization with a specific implicit-explicit decomposition that introduces\nthe concept of a predictor for the coupling term. We propose four coupling\npredictors that enable the monolithic system to be solved in a partitioned\nmanner and preserve the IMEX-RK structure and therefore the design order of\naccuracy of the monolithic scheme. The four partitioned solvers that result\nfrom these predictors are high-order accurate, allow for maximum re-use of\nexisting single-physics software, and two of the four solvers allow the\nsubsystems to be solved in parallel at a given stage and time step.

However, existing CNN-based methods\nare based on either patch-wise (region-wise) training and inference or fully\nconvolutional networks. Methods in the former category are generally\ntime-consuming due to severe storage and computational redundancies among\noverlapping patches. To overcome this deficiency, methods in the second\ncategory attempt to directly map a raw input image to a predicted dense\nsaliency map in a single network forward pass. Though being very efficient, it\nis arduous for these methods to detect salient objects of different scales or\nsalient regions with weak semantic information. In this paper, we develop\nhybrid contrast-oriented deep neural networks to overcome the aforementioned\nlimitations. Each of our deep networks is composed of two complementary\ncomponents, including a fully convolutional stream for dense prediction and a\nsegment-level spatial pooling stream for sparse saliency inference. We further\npropose an attentional module that learns weight maps for fusing the two\nsaliency predictions from these two streams.

The proposed optimal control solution is composed of a feedback\npart, depending of the followers' state, and a feed-forward part, depending on\nthe convex hull of the leaders' state. To comply with most real-world\napplications, the feedback and feed-forward states are assumed to be\nunavailable and are estimated using two distributed observers.

Here we present the analysis of 2.0 x 0.8 square degrees data\nfrom the UK Widefield Infrared Survey for H2 (UWISH2) in the 1-0S(1) line to\nidentify and characterize the outflows of the M17 complex. We uncover 48\nprobable outflows, of which, 93 per cent are new discoveries. We identified\ndriving source candidates for 60 per cent of the outflows. Among the driving\nsource candidate YSOs: 90 per cent are protostars and the reminder 10 per cent\nare Class II YSOs. Comparing with results from other surveys, we suggest that\nH2 emission fades very quickly as the objects evolve from protostars to\npre-main-sequence stars. We fit SED models to 14 candidate outflow driving\nsources and conclude that the outflows of our sample are mostly driven by\nmoderate-mass YSOs that are still actively accreting from their protoplanetary\ndisc. We examined the spatial distribution of the outflows with the gas and\ndust distribution of the complex, and observed that the filamentary dark-cloud\n\"M17SWex\" located at the south-western side of the complex, is associated with\na greater number of outflows.

In contrast to the well-known $PT$-symmetric nodal lines protected\nonly by $\\pi$ Berry phase in which a single nodal line can exist, the nodal\nlines with $Z_{2}$ monopole charges should always exist in pairs. We show that\na pair of nodal lines with $Z_{2}$ monopole charges is created by a {\\it double\nband inversion} (DBI) process, and that the resulting nodal lines are always\n{\\it linked by another nodal line} formed between the two topmost occupied\nbands.

We show that the second Stiefel-Whitney class can serve as a\nwell-defined topological invariant of a $PT$-invariant two-dimensional (2D)\ninsulator in the absence of Berry phase.

However, the work of Dowker,\nBombelli, Henson, and Sorkin might be taken to suggest that random sprinklings\nof points in Minkowski space define a discrete model that is provably\nPoincar\\'e invariant in a natural sense. We examine this possibility here. We\nargue that a genuinely Poincar\\'e invariant model requires a probability\ndistribution on sprinklable sets -- Poincar\\'e orbits of sprinklings -- rather\nthan individual sprinklings. The corresponding $\\sigma$-algebra contains only\nsets of measure zero or one. This makes testing the hypothesis of discrete\nPoincar\\'e invariance problematic, since any local violation of Poincar\\'e\ninvariance, however gross and large scale, is possible, and cannot be said to\nbe improbable. We also note that the Bombelli-Henson-Sorkin argument, which\nrules out constructions of preferred timelike directions for typical\nsprinklings, is not sufficient to establish full Lorentz invariance. For\nexample, once a pair of timelike separated points is fixed, a preferred\nspacelike direction {\\it can} be defined for a typical sprinkling, breaking the\nremaining rotational invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 14:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 17:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 23:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 20:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 11:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

We show how observations from multiple wavebands, in\nthis case optical and X-ray observations, can be used to facilitate the\ndistinction between the two. We discovered an extremely bright and rapid\ntransient event in optical observations of M31 with the intermediate Palomar\nTransient Factory (iPTF). The persistent optical counterpart of this transient\nwas previously thought to be a variable star in M31 without any dramatic flux\nexcursions. The iPTF event initially appeared to be an extraordinarily rapid\nand energetic extragalactic transient, a very fast nova in M31 being one of the\nexciting possibilities, with a ~3mag positive flux excursion in less than a\nkilosecond. The nature of the source was resolved with the help of Chandra\narchival data, where we found an X-ray counterpart and obtained its X-ray\nspectrum. We find the X-ray spectrum of the quiescent emission can be described\nby a model of optically thin plasma emission with a temperature of ~7MK,\ntypical for coronal emission from an active star. The combination of the X-ray\nluminosity, calculated assuming the source is located in M31 (~3.10^36 erg/s),\nand the color temperature exclude any type of known accreting compact object or\nactive star in M31. We argue instead that the optical transient source is an M\ntype main-sequence, active star located in the disk of the Milky Way at a\ndistance of ~0.5-1 kpc.

In the process, we also initiate work on a new\nstructural question concerning the stable matching problem, namely finding\nrelationships between the lattices of solutions of two \"nearby\" instances.\n  Our main algorithmic result is the following: We identify a polynomially\nlarge class of errors, $D$, that can be introduced in a stable matching\ninstance. Given an instance $A$ of stable matching, let $B$ be the random\nvariable that represents the instance that results after introducing {\\em one}\nerror from $D$, chosen via a given discrete probability distribution. The\nproblem is to find a stable matching for $A$ that maximizes the probability of\nbeing stable for $B$ as well. Via new structural properties of the type\ndescribed in the question stated above, we give a combinatorial polynomial time\nalgorithm for this problem.\n  We also show that the set of robust stable matchings for instance $A$, under\nprobability distribution $p$, forms a sublattice of the lattice of stable\nmatchings for $A$. We give an efficient algorithm for finding a succinct\nrepresentation for this set; this representation has the property that any\nmember of the set can be efficiently retrieved from it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 11:15:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 02:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 06:15:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 07:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

A hydrodynamic model and a modified stochastic\ndomain wall theory are proposed to describe the local density variation. The\nNagel-Schreckenberg model (NaSch), an agent based stochastic model, is used as\na benchmark. The hydrodynamic model provides good approximations over short\ntime scales. The domain wall model is found to reproduce the time evolution of\nlocal densities, in good agreement with the NaSch simulations for both short\nand long time scales. A systematic investigation of the impact of network\nparameters, including system sizes, cycle lengths, phase splits and signal\noffsets, on traffic flows suggests that the stationary flow is dominated by the\nboundary with the smaller split. Nevertheless, the signal offset plays an\nimportant role in determining the flow. Analytical expressions of the flow in\nrelation to those parameters are obtained for the deterministic domain wall\nmodel and match the deterministic NaSch simulations. The analytic results agree\nqualitatively with the general stochastic models. When the cycle is\nsufficiently short, the stationary state is governed by effective inflow and\noutflow rates, and the density profile is approximately linear and independent\nof time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 02:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

The Early\nequivalent model is applied to derive a simple representation that is simple\nand yet capable of incorporating the transistor non-linearities implied by the\nEarly effect. Mathematical expressions are obtained describing completely the\ncircuit operation in terms of currents and voltages, allowing accurate\nestimation of the average voltage gain, total harmonic distortion (THD), and\naverage input and output resistances. Prototypes of small signal silicon\ntransistors of types NPN and PNP obtained in a previous work are used to\ndiscuss the respectively implied properties of the common collector transistor.\nIn addition to confirming the importance of the trade-off of current gain for\nthe desired properties, it is also shown that sub-optimal performance can be\nobtained in case the base and emitter resistances are not properly chosen. Even\nso, the limited current gain implied by real-world NPN and PNP small signal\nsilicon devices implies some performance constraints. In particular, it has\nbeen observed that the THD tends to be larger for PNP devices than NPN\ncounterparts with the same average current gain. The obtained results pave the\nway not only to complementary analytical studies, but also provide guidance for\ndesign and implementation of improved common collector configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 15:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}
