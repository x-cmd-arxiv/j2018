But we also discovered limitations of the model when this locality\ncondition fails, in particular near the edge of a turbulent region.

The model is sufficiently simple to be implemented in stellar\nevolution codes, and all the model constants have been calibrated against DNSs.\nWhile significant limitations to its use remain (e.g. it can only be used in\nthe low P\\'eclet number, slowly rotating limit), we argue that it is more\nreliable than most of the astrophysical prescriptions that are used in stellar\nevolution models today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 16:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

In\nthe experiments presented within this study, we demonstrate the existence of a\nsurface tension gradient associated with the resultant Marangoni flow along an\nair-water interface that causes the slip velocity and slip length to be\nsignificantly reduced. In this study, the slip velocity along a\nmillimeter-sized air-water interface was investigated experimentally. This\nlarge-scale air-water interface facilitated a detailed investigation of the\ninterfacial velocity profiles as the flow rate, interfacial curvature and\ninterface geometry were varied. For the air-water interfaces supported above\ncontinuous grooves (concentric rings within a torsional shear flow) where no\nsurface tension gradient exists, a slip velocity as high as 30% of the bulk\nvelocity was observed. However, for the air-water interfaces supported above\ndiscontinuous grooves (rectangular channels in a Poiseuille flow), the presence\nof a surface tension gradient reduced the slip velocity and in some cases\nresulted in an interfacial velocity that was opposite to the main flow\ndirection. The curvature of the air-water interface in the spanwise direction\nwas found to dictate the details of the interfacial flow profile with reverse\nflow in the center of the interface for concave surfaces and along the outside\nof the interface for convex surfaces. The deflection of the air-water interface\nwas also found to greatly affect the magnitude of the slip.

Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to\nmetallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement\nstructure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental\ndifficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.\nWe investigate this problem by carefully analyzing two \"toy\" models for\ncoherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated\nthree-dimensional, noninteracting Anderson model and a class of random quantum\ncircuits acting on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive,\ninteracting fermion problem. Crucially, the random circuit model can also be\ntuned to have no interactions between the fermions, similar to the Anderson\nmodel. We show that the long-time states of driven noninteracting fermions\nexhibit volume-law mutual information and entanglement, both for our random\ncircuit model and for the nonequilibrium steady-state of the Anderson model.\nWith interactions, the random circuit model is quantum chaotic and approaches\nlocal equilibrium, with only short-range entanglement. These results provide a\ngeneric picture for the emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven\nquantum-chaotic systems, and also provide examples of stable, highly-entangled\nmany-body states out of equilibrium. We discuss experimental techniques to\nprobe these effects in low-temperature mesoscopic wires or ultracold atomic\ngases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 15:27:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 14:39:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 19:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 19:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

Therefore the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such\nstars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically,\nPPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from\nmassive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim\nto compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first\nreview the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar\nnumber density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far\nultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external\nphotoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to\nan arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric\nencounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_v > 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying\nlocal environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar\ndensity ($n_{c} > 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant\nrole in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a timescale $\\sim 3$ Myr. By\ncombining theoretical mass loss rates due to FUV flux with viscous spreading in\na PPD we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely\ndestroyed by external photoevaporation. Comparing these thresholds in local\nclusters we find that if either mechanism has a significant impact on the PPD\npopulation then photoevaporation is always the dominating influence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 18:02:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 11:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

MR-Electrical Properties Tomography (MR-EPT) aims to\nreconstruct tissue EPs by solving an electromagnetic inverse problem relating\nMR measurements of the transmit radiofrequency RF field to the EPs. However,\nMR-EPT reconstructions highly suffer from noise in the RF field maps, which\nlimits the clinical applicability. Instead of employing electromagnetic models\nposing strict requirements on the measured quantities, we propose a data driven\napproach where the inverse transformation is learned by means of a neural\nnetwork.

DL-EPT shows high quality EP maps, demonstrating good accuracy\nand greatly improved precision compared to conventional MR-EPT. Moreover,\nDL-EPT allows permittivity reconstructions at 3 Tesla, which is not possible\nwith state-of-art MR-EPT techniques. The supervised learning-based approach\nleverages the strength of tailored electromagnetic simulations, allowing\ninclusion of a priori information (e.g. coil setup) and circumvention of\ninaccessible MR electromagnetic quantities.

The post-peak optical light curves show a long,\nlinear decline with a steep slope of 2.5 mag/100 days (i.e., an exponential\ndecline in flux), through the end of observations at phase ~260 days. In\ncontrast, the light curves of hydrogen rich supernovae (SNe II-P/L) always show\nbreaks in their light curves at phase ~100 days, before settling onto Co56\nradioactive decay tails with a decline rate of about 1 mag/100 days. The\nspectra of ASASSN-15nx do not exhibit the narrow emission-line features\ncharacteristic of Type IIn SNe, which can have a wide variety of light-curve\nshapes usually attributed to strong interactions with a dense circumstellar\nmedium (CSM). ASASSN-15nx has a number of spectroscopic peculiarities,\nincluding a relatively weak and triangularly-shaped H-alpha emission profile\nwith no absorption component. The physical origin of these peculiarities is\nunclear, but the long and linear post-peak light curve without a break suggests\na single dominant powering mechanism. Decay of a large amount of Ni56 (M_Ni56 =\n1.6 +/- 0.2 M_sun) can power the light curve of ASASSN-15nx, and the steep\nlight-curve slope requires substantial gamma-ray escape from the ejecta, which\nis possible given a low-mass hydrogen envelope for the progenitor. Another\npossibility is strong CSM interactions powering the light curve, but the CSM\nneeds to be sculpted to produce the unique light-curve shape and to avoid\nproducing SN IIn-like narrow emission lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 18:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The characteristics of the radiative\ninteraction when a wavepacket of size (duration) is short relative to the\nradiation wavelength, are close to the predictions of the classical\npoint-particle modeling.

Besides, the\nradiation analysis is further extended to the cases of superradiant emission\nfrom a beam of phase-correlated modulated electron wavepackets.

We observe an interference pattern both in SGM and TSGM images, and\nevidence large differences between the two signals in the low density regime of\nthe QPC. In particular, a large phase jump appears in the interference fringes\nrecorded by TSGM, which is not visible in SGM. We discuss this difference of\nsensitivity using a microscopic model of the experiment, based on the\ncontribution from a resonant level inside or close to the QPC. This work\ndemonstrates that combining scanning gate microscopy with thermoelectric\nmeasurements offers new information as compared to SGM, and provides a direct\naccess to the derivative of the device transmission with respect to energy,\nboth in amplitude and in phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 22:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 09:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 11:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

The notion of a\ntriple, a quadruple, or more generally, an element of size (or measure) n>2 is\nnot definable within this framework, and therefore it seems at first glance\nthat Maddux's theorem cannot be generalized. It turns out, however, that a very\nfar-reaching generalization of Maddux's result is possible if one is willing to\ngo outside of the equational framework of relation algebras, and work instead\nwithin the framework of the first-order theory.\n  In the present paper, we define the notion of an atom below the identity\nelement in a relation algebra having measure n for an arbitrary cardinal number\nn>0, and we define a relation algebra to be measurable if it's identity element\nis the sum of atoms each of which has some (finite or infinite) measure.

However, labeling large-scale\ndata can be very costly and error-prone, and even high-quality datasets are\nlikely to contain noisy (incorrect) labels. Existing works usually employ a\nclosed-set assumption, whereby the samples associated with noisy labels possess\na true class contained within the set of known classes in the training data.\nHowever, such an assumption is too restrictive for many applications, since\nsamples associated with noisy labels might in fact possess a true class that is\nnot present in the training data. We refer to this more complex scenario as the\n\\textbf{open-set noisy label} problem and show that it is nontrivial in order\nto make accurate predictions.

Our approach detects noisy labels and learns deep discriminative\nfeatures in an iterative fashion. To benefit from the noisy label detection, we\ndesign a Siamese network to encourage clean labels and noisy labels to be\ndissimilar.

The phase diagrams\nof the experimentally known stoichiometries like U2N3 and UN2 are refined. At\nzero temperature and pressure, the experimentally observed CaF2-type UN2 is\nfound to transform into another new I41/amd-type UN2, which is related to the\ndynamical instability originated from Peierls mechanism. Two new stable\nhigh-pressure phases of U2N3 and UN2 are identified for the first time.\nBesides, several new chemical stoichiometries (UN4, UN3, U3N5 and U2N) are\nfound to have stability fields on the U-N phase diagram. The pressure-induced\nphase transitions for the U-N system are further investigated. The peculiar\nstructural features such as N2-dimers, planar SO3-like N(N)3 units,\nnon-coplarnar zigzag N4 units, and zigzag U chains are found in U-N compounds\nunder pressure.

In many such studies, the event time\nof interest is not directly observed but is known relative to periodic\nexamination times; i.e., practitioners observe either current status or\ninterval-censored data. The analysis of data of this structure is often fraught\nwith many difficulties. Further exacerbating this issue, in some such studies\nthe observed data also consists of instantaneous failures; i.e., the event\ntimes for several study units coincide exactly with the time at which the study\nbegins. In light of these difficulties, this work focuses on developing a\nmixture model, under the PH assumptions, which can be used to analyze\ninterval-censored data subject to instantaneous failures. To allow for modeling\nflexibility, two methods of estimating the unknown cumulative baseline hazard\nfunction are proposed; a fully parametric and a monotone spline representation\nare considered. Through a novel data augmentation procedure involving latent\nPoisson random variables, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was\ndeveloped to complete model fitting.

First, previous works\npredominantly generate temporal event proposals in the forward direction, which\nneglects future video context.

In this paper, to enable global context reasoning for\nbetter aligning image and language domains in diverse and unrestricted cases,\nwe propose a novel reasoning network called Adversarial Composition Modular\nNetwork (ACMN). This network comprises of two collaborative modules: i) an\nadversarial attention module to exploit the local visual evidence for each word\nparsed from the question; ii) a residual composition module to compose the\npreviously mined evidence. Given a dependency parse tree for each question, the\nadversarial attention module progressively discovers salient regions of one\nword by densely combining regions of child word nodes in an adversarial manner.\nThen residual composition module merges the hidden representations of an\narbitrary number of children through sum pooling and residual connection. Our\nACMN is thus capable of building an interpretable VQA system that gradually\ndives the image cues following a question-driven reasoning route and makes\nglobal reasoning by incorporating the learned knowledge of all attention\nmodules in a principled manner.

Removing this splinter requires surgical\nprecision: the ATLAS constraint on stop pair production reinterpreted here\ntreats the signal as a contaminant to the measurement of the top pair\nproduction cross section using data from $\\sqrt{s} = 7 \\text{ TeV}$ and $8\n\\text{ TeV}$ in a correlated way to control for some systematic errors. ATLAS\nfixed $m(\\tilde{t}) \\simeq m_t$ and $m(\\tilde{\\chi})= 1 \\text{ GeV}$, implying\nthat a careful recasting of these results into the full $m(\\tilde{t}) -\nm(\\tilde{\\chi})$ plane is warranted. We find that the parameter space with\n$m(\\tilde{\\chi})\\lesssim 55 \\text{ GeV}$ is excluded for $m(\\tilde{t}) \\simeq\nm_t$ --- although this search does cover new parameter space, it is unable to\nfully pull the splinter. Along the way, we review a variety of interesting\nphysical issues in detail: (i) when the two-body width is a good approximation;\n(ii) what the impact on the total rate from taking the narrow width is a good\napproximation; (iii) how the production rate is affected when the wrong widths\nare used; (iv) what role the spin correlations play in the limits. In addition,\nwe provide a guide to using MadGraph for implementing the full production\nincluding finite width and spin correlation effects, and we survey a variety of\npitfalls one might encounter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 03:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

The key\npoint to handle missing labels is propagating the label information from\nprovided labels to missing labels, through a dependency graph that each label\nof each instance is treated as a node. We build this graph by utilizing\ndifferent types of label dependencies. Specifically, the instance-level\nsimilarity is served as undirected edges to connect the label nodes across\ndifferent instances and the semantic label hierarchy is used as directed edges\nto connect different classes. This base graph is referred to as the mixed\ndependency graph, as it includes both undirected and directed edges.\nFurthermore, we present another two types of label dependencies to connect the\nlabel nodes across different classes. One is the class co-occurrence, which is\nalso encoded as undirected edges. Combining with the base graph, we obtain a\nnew mixed graph, called MG-CO (mixed graph with co-occurrence). The other is\nthe sparse and low rank decomposition of the whole label matrix, to embed\nhigh-order dependencies over all labels. Combining with the base graph, the new\nmixed graph is called as MG-SL (mixed graph with sparse and low rank\ndecomposition). Based on MG-CO and MG-SL, we propose two convex transductive\nformulations of the MLML problem, denoted as MLMG-CO and MLMG-SL, respectively.\nTwo important applications, including image annotation and tag based image\nretrieval, can be jointly handled using our proposed methods.

Our main interest is to save communication resource for\ninformation exchange over the network and reduce processing time. Each node of\nthe network uses a convex optimization based algorithm that provides a locally\noptimum solution for that node. The nodes exchange their signal estimates over\nthe network in order to refine their local estimates. At a node, the\noptimization algorithm is based on an $\\ell_1$-norm minimization with\nappropriate modifications to promote sparsity as well as to include influence\nof estimates from neighboring nodes. Our expectation is that local estimates in\neach node improve fast and converge, resulting in a limited demand for\ncommunication of estimates between nodes and reducing the processing time. We\nprovide restricted-isometry-property (RIP)-based theoretical analysis on\nestimation quality. In the scenario of clean observation, it is shown that the\nlocal estimates converge to the exact sparse signal under certain technical\nconditions.

Here, the\nspin lifetime is essentially determined by the small $k$-cubic spin-orbit terms\nand nearly independent of the wire radius.

The value\nof a model of course should critically depend on its ability to reproduce the\ndynamical behavior of the modeled system; however, few attempts have been made\nto inquire into the dynamics of inferred models in neuroscience, and none, to\nour knowledge, at the network level. Here we introduce a principled\nmodification of a widely used generalized linear model (GLM), and learn its\nstructural and dynamic parameters from ex-vivo spiking data. We show that the\nnew model is able to capture the most prominent features of the highly\nnon-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network,\nwhere the reference GLM largely fails. Two ingredients turn out to be key for\nsuccess. The first one is a bounded transfer function that makes the single\nneuron able to respond to its input in a saturating fashion; beyond its\nbiological plausibility such property, by limiting the capacity of the neuron\nto transfer information, makes the coding more robust in the face of the highly\nvariable network activity, and noise. The second ingredient is a super-Poisson\nspikes generative probabilistic mechanism; this feature, that accounts for the\nfact that observations largely undersample the network, allows the model neuron\nto more flexibly incorporate the observed activity fluctuations. Taken\ntogether, the two ingredients, without increasing complexity, allow the model\nto capture the key dynamic elements. When left free to generate its spontaneous\nactivity, the inferred model proved able to reproduce not only the\nnon-stationary population dynamics of the network, but also part of the\nfine-grained structure of the dynamics at the single neuron level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 10:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 09:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-09"}

The dynamic nature of cloud data center network's traffic, as well as\nthe existence of big flows make it necessary to periodically reprogram the\nnetwork through the SDN controller. Therefore, it is critical for network\nresearchers to minimize the side-effects of network reconfiguration. In this\nway, the most challenging issue is the number of rerouted flows that affect the\nnetwork stability and QoS parameters. As a result, dynamic reconfiguration of\nthe network with minimum overhead (i.e. minimum flow rerouting) is an\ninteresting problem in SDN-based resource reallocation.

The presence of\ndamage in structures may be identified by monitoring the changes in dynamic\nbehavior subject to external loading, and is typically performed by using\nexperimental modal analysis (EMA) or operational modal analysis (OMA). These\ntools for SHM normally require a limited number of physically attached\ntransducers (e.g. accelerometers) in order to record the response of the\nstructure for further analysis. Signal conditioners, wires, wireless receivers\nand a data acquisition system (DAQ) are also typical components of traditional\nsensing systems used in vibration-based SHM. However, instrumentation of\nlightweight structures with contact sensors such as accelerometers may induce\nmass-loading effects, and for large-scale structures, the instrumentation is\nlabor intensive and time consuming. Achieving high spatial measurement\nresolution for a large-scale structure is not always feasible while working\nwith traditional contact sensors, and there is also the potential for a lack of\nreliability associated with fixed contact sensors in outliving the life-span of\nthe host structure.

One way\nto estimate a small displacement is to measure the Doppler shift generated in\nlight reflected off an object moving with a known periodic frequency. This\nremote sensing technique converts a displacement measurement into a frequency\nmeasurement, and has been considerably successful [8-14]. The displacement\nsensitivity of this technique is limited by the Doppler frequency noise floor\nand by the velocity of the moving object. Other primary limitations are hours\nof integration time [12,13] and optimal operation only in a narrow Doppler\nfrequency range. Here we show a sensitive device capable of measuring\n$\\mu$Hz/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ Doppler frequency shifts corresponding to tens of fm\ndisplacements for a mirror oscillating at 2 Hz. While the Doppler shift\nmeasured is comparable to other techniques [12.13], the position sensitivity is\norders of magnitude better, and operates over several orders of magnitude of\nDoppler frequency range. In addition, unlike other techniques which often rely\non interferometric methods, our device is phase insensitive, making it\nunusually robust to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 21:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

The\nnext-generation extreme-ultraviolet- (EUV) lithography instruments with a\nwavelength of \\SI{13.5}{\\nano\\meter} is currently under development. In\nprinciple, this should allow patterning down to a resolution of a few\nnanometers in a single exposure. However, there are many technical challenges,\nincluding those due to the very high energy of the photons. Lithography with\nmetastable atoms has been suggested as a cost-effective, less-complex\nalternative to EUV lithography. The great advantage of atom lithography is that\nthe kinetic energy of an atom is much smaller than that of a photon for a given\nwavelength. However, up till now no method has been available for making masks\nfor atom lithography that can produce arbitrary, high resolution patterns. Here\nwe present a solution to this problem. First, traditional binary holography is\nextended to near-field binary holography, based on Fresnel diffraction. By this\ntechnique, we demonstrate that it is possible to make masks that can generate\narbitrary patterns in a plane in the near field (from the mask) with a\nresolution down to the nanometer range using a state of the art metastable\nhelium source. We compare the flux of this source to that of an established EUV\nsource (ASML, NXE:3100) and show that patterns can potentially be produced at\ncomparable speeds. Finally, we present an extension of the grid-based\nholography method for a grid of hexagonally shaped subcells. Our method can be\nused with any beam that can be modeled as a scalar wave, including other\nmatter-wave beams such as helium ions, electrons or acoustic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 16:45:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 14:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 18:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}
