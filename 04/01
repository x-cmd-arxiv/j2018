Earlier works in the literature focussed mainly on\ntwo-mode non-Gaussian states generated by de-Gaussification of two-mode\nsqueezed vacuum states. In the current work, we study quan- tum teleportation\nwith a class of non-Gaussian entangled resource states that are generated at\nthe output of a passive beam splitter (BS) with different input single mode\nnon-Gaussian states. In particular, we consider input states that are generated\nunder successive application of squeezing and photon addition/subtraction\noperations in various orders. We focus on identifying what attributes of the\nresource states are necessary or sufficient for quantum teleportation (QT). To\nthis end we first evaluate two attributes considered in the literature, viz.\nsqueezed vacuum affinity (SVA) and EPR correlation. While SVA is not non-zero\nfor all two-mode resource states, EPR correlation is neither necessary nor\nsufficient of QT. We consider yet another attribute, viz. two-mode quadrature\nsqueezing as defined by Simon et. al. [Phys. Rev. A 49, 1567 (1994)]. Our\nnumerical results on the de-Gaussified two-mode squeezed vacuum state as well\nas the BS generated non-Gaussian states lead us to the conclusion that two-mode\nquadrature squeezing is a necessary condition for QT, in general.

We consider graphs and Markov decision processes (MDPs), which\nare fundamental models for reactive systems. One of the very basic\nspecifications that arise in verification of reactive systems is the strong\nfairness (aka Streett) objective. Given different types of requests and\ncorresponding grants, the objective requires that for each type, if the request\nevent happens infinitely often, then the corresponding grant event must also\nhappen infinitely often. All $\\omega$-regular objectives can be expressed as\nStreett objectives and hence they are canonical in verification. To handle the\nstate-space explosion, symbolic algorithms are required that operate on a\nsuccinct implicit representation of the system rather than explicitly accessing\nthe system. While explicit algorithms for graphs and MDPs with Streett\nobjectives have been widely studied, there has been no improvement of the basic\nsymbolic algorithms. The worst-case numbers of symbolic steps required for the\nbasic symbolic algorithms are as follows: quadratic for graphs and cubic for\nMDPs. In this work we present the first sub-quadratic symbolic algorithm for\ngraphs with Streett objectives, and our algorithm is sub-quadratic even for\nMDPs. Based on our algorithmic insights we present an implementation of the new\nsymbolic approach and show that it improves the existing approach on several\nacademic benchmark examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 19:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 15:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

The payoff of this kind of policies depends on the residual life\ntime of the insured as well as the trend of a portfolio traded in the financial\nmarket, where investments in a riskless asset, a risky asset and a longevity\nbond are allowed. We propose a modeling framework that takes into account\nmutual dependence between the financial and the insurance markets via an\nobservable stochastic process, which affects the risky asset and the mortality\nindex dynamics. Since the market is incomplete due to the presence of basis\nrisk, in alternative to arbitrage pricing we use expected utility maximization\nunder exponential preferences as evaluation approach, which leads to the\nso-called indifference price. Under partial information this methodology\nrequires filtering techniques that can reduce the original control problem to\nan equivalent problem in complete information.

A common prerequisite in network analysis is that information on\nnodes and links will be complete because network topologies are extremely\nsensitive to missing information of this kind. Therefore, many real-world\nnetworks that fail to meet this criterion under random sampling may be\ndiscarded.\n  In this paper we offer a framework for interpreting the missing observations\nin network data under the hypothesis that these observations are not missing at\nrandom. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study of a financial trade\nnetwork, where the awareness of agents to the data collection procedure by a\nself-interested observer may result in strategic revealing or withholding of\ninformation. The non-random missingness has been overlooked despite the\npossibility of this being an important feature of the processes by which the\nnetwork is generated. The analysis demonstrates that strategic information\nwithholding may be a valid general phenomenon in complex systems. The evidence\nis sufficient to support the existence of an influential observer and to offer\na compelling dynamic mechanism for the creation of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2018 01:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

In specific, during training, the GCT\nmodel aims to learn off-line a set of correspondence templates from positive\ntraining pairs with various pose-pair configurations via patch-wise graph\nmatching. During testing, for each pair of test samples, we select a few\ntraining pairs with the most similar pose-pair configurations as references,\nand transfer the correspondences of these references to test pair for feature\ndistance calculation. The matching score is derived by aggregating distances\nfrom different references. For each probe image, the gallery image with the\nhighest matching score is the re-identifying result.

Present attack\ncategorization techniques protect a specific group of threat which has either\nmessed the entire taxonomy structure or ambiguous when one network attacks get\nblended with few others attacks. Hence, this raises concerns about developing a\ncommon and general purpose taxonomy. In this study, a sequential\nquestion-answer based model of categorization is proposed.

Under such circumstance it leads to\nbileptino LSP when the MSSM is extended by $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge group within the\nframework of Double Focus Point (DFP) supersymmetry. The bileptino is a copy of\nhiggsino whose partner, bilepton, is used to break $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry\nspontaneously. Such scenario, however, is not favored by direct detection since\nit leads to unacceptable spin-independent cross section when one requires\ncorrect self-scattering cross section.

The right-handed sneutrino in\nthis model acts as LSP in most of parameter space for non-vanishing soft\ntrilinear coupling $T_{\\eta}$. It is thus consistent of the requirement of DFP\nSUSY without involving any direct detection issue.

There is no consensus on the amplitude of the historical solar\nforcing. The estimated magnitude of the total solar irradiance difference\nbetween Maunder minimum and present time ranges from 0.1 to 6 W/m2 making\nuncertain the simulation of the past and future climate. One reason for this\ndisagreement is the applied evolution of the quiet Sun brightness in the solar\nirradiance reconstruction models. This work addresses the role of the quiet Sun\nmodel choice and updated solar magnetic activity proxies on the solar forcing\nreconstruction. Aims. We aim to establish a plausible range of the solar\nirradiance variability on decadal to millennial time scales. Methods. The\nspectral solar irradiance (SSI) is calculated as a weighted sum of the\ncontributions from sunspot umbra/penumbra, fac- ulae and quiet Sun, which are\npre-calculated with the spectral synthesis code NESSY. We introduce activity\nbelts of the contributions from sunspots and faculae and a new structure model\nfor the quietest state of the Sun. We assume that the brightness of the quiet\nSun varies in time proportionally to the secular (22-year smoothed) variation\nof the solar modulation potential. Results. A new reconstruction of the TSI and\nSSI covering the period 6000 BCE - 2015 CE is presented. The model simulates\nsolar irradiance variability during the satellite era well. The TSI change\nbetween the Maunder and recent minima ranges between 3.7 and 4.5 W/m2 depending\non the applied solar modulation potential. The implementation of a new quietest\nSun model reduces, by approximately a factor of two, the relative solar forcing\ncompared to the largest previous estimation, while the application of updated\nsolar modulation potential increases the forcing difference between Maunder\nminimum and the present by 25-40 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2018 12:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

This theory gives rise to two sets of linear equations, the first for the\namplitudes of the waves in the space between successive blocks, and the second\nfor the amplitudes of the waves in the two half spaces. The first set is solved\nnumerically to furnish reference solutions. The second set is submitted to\nlow-frequency approximation procedure whereby the pressure fields are found to\nbe those for a configuration in which the grating becomes a homogeneous layer\nof the same thickness as the height of the blocks in the grating.

However, Timothy\nWallstrom and others have emphasized that SM runs into the problem that it\ncannot recover the Schroedinger equation of QM unless an ad hoc quantization\ncondition is assumed. In this thesis, I reformulate SM so that the quantization\ncondition arises as a natural consequence of the classical point particles\ninteracting with the classical-like ether. This is done by combining SM with a\nproposal by Louis de Broglie and David Bohm, in which an elementary particle in\nits rest frame is viewed as a localized periodic phenomenon of fixed frequency,\nfrom which it follows that the phase of the periodic phenomenon in the lab\nframe satisfies a relation that's equivalent to the quantization condition. In\ndoing so, I argue that SM can once again be regarded as a viable approach to\nreconstructing QM. In addition, I show that SM yields novel and empirically\nviable models of semiclassical Newtonian gravity and electrodynamics, simply by\nincorporating classical Newtonian gravitational and electrostatic interactions\nbetween the particles. I also show how the Schroedinger-Newton equation and the\nSchroedinger-Coulomb equation arise as mean-field approximations from within\nthese SM models of semiclassical Newtonian gravity and electrodynamics, and how\nclassical Newtonian gravity can be recovered from an appropriate center-of-mass\ndescription of many interacting SM particles. Finally, I argue that SM has\ndistinct advantages over the standard and other heterodox approaches to\ncombining quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity semiclassically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 18:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

We present the electric field-induced tuning of the\nlight transmission in a photonic crystal device, made by alternating layers of\nsilver nanoparticles and titanium dioxide nanoparticles. We show a shift of\naround 10 nm for an applied voltage of 10 V. We ascribe the shift to an\naccumulation of charges at the silver/TiO2 interface due to electric field,\nresulting in an increase of the number of charges contributing to the plasma\nfrequency in silver, giving rise to a blue shift of the silver plasmon band,\nwith concomitant blue shift of the photonic band gap. The employment of a\nrelatively low applied voltage gives the possibility to build a compact and\nlow-cost device.
