Previous estimations of the non-thermal electron\nenergy based on the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager\n(RHESSI) data were incomplete since RHESSI missed the peak of the flare\nimpulsive phase. In contrast, HEND observed the whole flare. We used two models\nto estimate the energy of the non-thermal electrons: the cold thick target\nmodel and the warm thick target model. We found that, depending on the model\nused and the low-energy cutoff ($E_\\mathrm{c}$) of the non-thermal electrons,\nthe estimate of their total energy in the entire flare can vary from $2.3\n\\times 10^{32}$ to $6.2 \\times 10^{33}$ ergs. The lowest estimate, $2.3 \\times\n10^{32}$ ergs, obtained within the cold thick target model and fixed\n$E_\\mathrm{c}=43$ keV, is consistent with the previous estimate. In this case,\nnon-thermal electrons accelerated in the peak of the flare impulsive phase\nmissed by RHESSI contained approximately $40\\%$ of the total energy of\nnon-thermal electrons of the entire flare.

This means that the expectation of $f$ with respect to\nthe biased measure $\\mu_{p}$ increases rapidly from 0 to 1 as $p$ increases.\n  In this paper we present `robust' versions of the theorem, which assert that\nit holds also if the function is `almost' monotone, and admits a much weaker\nnotion of symmetry. Unlike the original proof of the theorem which relies on\nhypercontractivity, our proof relies on a `regularity' lemma (of the class of\nSzemer\\'edi's regularity lemma and its generalizations) and on the `invariance\nprinciple' of Mossel, O'Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz which allows (under certain\nconditions) replacing functions on the cube $\\{0,1\\}^{n}$ with functions on\nGaussian random variables.\n  The hypergraph removal lemma of Gowers (2007) and independently of Nagle,\nR\\\"odl, Schacht, and Skokan (2006) says that if a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$\nvertices contains few copies of a fixed hypergraph $H$, then it can be made\n$H$-free by removing few of its edges. While this settles the `hypergraph\nremoval problem' in the case where $k$ and $H$ are fixed, the result is\nmeaningless when $k$ is large (e.g. $k>\\log\\log\\log n$).\n  Using our robust version of the Friedgut-Kalai Theorem, we obtain a\nhypergraph removal lemma that holds for $k$ up to linear in $n$ for a large\nclass of hypergraphs.

All current CCA algorithms require correspondences\nbetween the views. We introduce a new method Unsupervised Correlation Analysis\n(UCA), which requires no prior correspondences between the two domains. The\ncorrelation maximization term in CCA is replaced by a combination of a\nreconstruction term (similar to autoencoders), full cycle loss, orthogonality\nand multiple domain confusion terms.

This proves to be very effective at identifying cool brown dwarfs via\nthe detection of their methane absorption, as well as providing preliminary\nclassification using methane colours and WISE-to-near-infrared colours. New and\nupdated calibrations between T/Y spectral types and CH4s-CH4l, J3-W2, and\nCH4s-W2 colours are derived, producing classification estimates good to a few\nspectral sub-types. We present photometry for a large sample of T and Y dwarfs\nin these filters, together with spectroscopy for 23 new ultra-cool dwarfs - two\nY dwarfs and twenty one T dwarfs. We identify a further 8 new cool brown\ndwarfs, which we have high confidence are T dwarfs based on their methane\nphotometry. We find that, for objects observed on a 4m-class telescope at J\nband magnitudes of ~20 or brighter, CH4s-CH4l is the more powerful colour for\ndetecting objects and then estimating spectral types. Due to the lower sky\nbackground in the J-band, the J3 and J2 bands are more useful for identifying\nfainter cool dwarfs at J>22. The J3-J2 colour is poor at estimating spectral\ntypes. But fortunately, once J3-J2 confirms that an object is a cool dwarf, the\nJ3-W2 colour is very effective at estimating approximate spectral types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 00:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Multimedia\ncontent (i.e., audio, image, and video) and emojis are present in 20% and 11.2%\nof all messages respectively. Political groups use more text messages than\nnon-political groups. Second, we characterize novel features that represent the\nbehavior of a public group, with multiple conversational turns between key\nmembers, with the participation of other members of the group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 05:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

Current attempts at improving blockchain scalability are\nlimited to cryptocurrency. Scaling blockchain systems under general workloads\n(i.e., non-cryptocurrency applications) remains an open question. In this work,\nwe take a principled approach to apply sharding, which is a well-studied and\nproven technique to scale out databases, to blockchain systems in order to\nimprove their transaction throughput at scale. This is challenging, however,\ndue to the fundamental difference in failure models between databases and\nblockchain. To achieve our goal, we first enhance the performance of Byzantine\nconsensus protocols, by doing so we improve individual shards' throughput.\nNext, we design an efficient shard formation protocol that leverages a trusted\nrandom beacon to securely assign nodes into shards. We rely on trusted\nhardware, namely Intel SGX, to achieve high performance for both consensus and\nshard formation protocol. Third, we design a general distributed transaction\nprotocol that ensures safety and liveness even when transaction coordinators\nare malicious. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of our design both\non a local cluster and on Google Cloud Platform. The results show that our\nconsensus and shard formation protocols outperform state-of-the-art solutions\nat scale.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the sensitivity of multi-user scheduling performance to\nchannel misreporting in systems with massive antennas. The main result is that\nfor the round-robin scheduler combined with max-min power control, the channel\nmagnitude misreporting is harmful to the scheduling performance and has a\ndifferent impact from the purely physical layer analysis. Specifically, for the\nhomogeneous users that have equal average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs),\nunderreporting is harmful, while overreporting is beneficial to others. In\nunderreporting, the asymptotic rate loss on others is derived, which is tight\nwhen the number of antennas is huge. One interesting observation in our\nresearch is that the rate loss \"periodically\" increases and decreases as the\nnumber of misreporters grows. For the heterogeneous users that have various\nSNRs, both underreporting and overreporting can degrade the scheduler\nperformance. We observe that strong misreporting changes the user grouping\ndecision and hence greatly decreases some users' rates regardless of others\ngaining rate improvements, while with carefully designed weak misreporting, the\nscheduling decision keeps fixed and the rate loss on others is shown to grow\nnearly linearly with the number of misreporters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 07:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

In this paper, we make an\nattempt to exploit high-order statistics in object detection, aiming at\ngenerating more discriminative representations for proposals to enhance the\nperformance of detectors.

These constructs may\nhave no relevance for security, but are needed to accommodate differences\nbetween the source language and the target language that fully abstract\ncompilation necessarily regards. As an alternative to fully abstract\ncompilation, this paper explores a different criterion for secure compilation\ncalled robustly safe compilation or RSC. Briefly, this criterion means that the\ncompiled code preserves relevant safety properties of the source program\nagainst all adversarial contexts interacting with said program. We show that\nRSC can be attained easily and results in code that is more efficient than that\ngenerated by fully abstract compilers.

Large fragments are\nejected with speeds of the order of the escape velocity from the parent body.\nAfter the family formation, the fragments' orbits evolve in the space of proper\nelements because of gravitational and non-gravitational perturbations, such as\nthe Yarkovsky effect. Disentangling the contribution to the current orbital\nposition of family members caused by the initial ejection velocity field and\nthe subsequent orbital evolution is usually a difficult task. Among the more\nthan 100 asteroid families currently known, some interact with secular\nresonances. Linear secular resonances occur when there is a commensurability\nbetween the precession frequency of the longitude of the pericenter (g) or of\nthe longitude of node (s) of an asteroid and a planet, or a massive asteroid.\nThe linear secular resonance most effective in increasing an asteroid\neccentricity is the ${\\nu}_6$, that corresponds to a commensurability between\nthe precession frequency g of an asteroid and Saturn's $g_6$. Non-linear\nsecular resonances involve commensurabilities of higher order, and can often be\nexpressed as combinations of linear secular resonances. This is the case, for\ninstance, of the $z_k=k(g-g_6)+(s-s_6)$ resonances. Asteroid families that are\ncrossed by secular resonances are of particular interest in dynamical\nastronomy. First, they often provide a clear evidence of asteroid orbit\nevolution due to the Yarkovsky effect. Second, conserved quantities of secular\ndynamics can be used to set valuable constraints on the magnitude of the\noriginal ejection velocity field. Finally, by changing the value of inclination\nof family members nodal secular resonances with massive asteroids or dwarf\nplanets can cause the i distribution to become more and more leptokurtic (i.e.,\nmore peaked and with larger tails than that of a Gaussian distribution).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 13:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

These regimes can be associated with\nbifurcations of equilibria in the low-noise limit.

This allows to\npredict the temperature dependent heat conductivity for the full range of\nobserved meteoritic compositions and also for possible other compositions. For\nthis purpose, published results on the temperature dependence of heat\nconductivity of the mineral components found in chondritic material are fitted\nto the model of Callaway for heat conductivity in solids by phonons.

First, we derive the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB) and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the localization of VLC\nunits in the proposed cooperative scenario. To tackle the nonconvex structure\nof the MLE, we adopt a set-theoretic approach by formulating the problem of\ncooperative localization as a quasiconvex feasibility problem, where the aim is\nto find a point inside the intersection of convex constraint sets constructed\nas the sublevel sets of quasiconvex functions resulting from the Lambertian\nformula. Next, we devise two feasibility-seeking algorithms based on iterative\ngradient projections to solve the feasibility problem. Both algorithms are\namenable to distributed implementation, thereby avoiding high-complexity\ncentralized approaches. Capitalizing on the concept of quasi-Fej\\'er convergent\nsequences, we carry out a formal convergence analysis to prove that the\nproposed algorithms converge to a solution of the feasibility problem in the\nconsistent case.

This approach allows us to learn without ground truth\ndecompositions, and to instead exploit information available from multiple\nimages when training.

We describe a new learning framework based on this idea,\nincluding new loss functions that can be efficiently evaluated over entire\nsequences.

We study how Jupiter-mass\nplanet-seeds (termed protoplanets) evolve in massive, but gravitationally\nstable (Q>1.5), discs using radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We find that\nthe protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in\nthe disc. Thereafter, it either continues to migrate inwards on a much longer\ntimescale or starts migrating outwards. Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time). Due to the high gas accretion\nrate, the protoplanet generally grows above the deuterium-burning mass-limit.\nProtoplanet radiative feedback reduces its mass growth so that its final mass\nis near the brown dwarf-planet boundary. The fate of a young planet-seed is\ndiverse and could vary from a gas giant planet on a circular orbit at a few AU\nfrom the central star to a brown dwarf on an eccentric, wide orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 15:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

The rise of innovative transportation services\nand recent break-throughs in autonomous vehicles will lead to the continued\ngrowth of trajectory data and related applications. Supporting these services\nin emerging platforms will require more efficient query processing in\ntrajectory databases. In this paper, we propose two new coverage queries for\ntrajectory databases: (i) k Maximizing Reverse Range Search on Trajectories\n(kMaxRRST); and (ii) a Maximum k Coverage Range Search on Trajectories\n(MaxkCovRST). We propose a novel index structure, the Trajectory Quadtree\n(TQ-tree) that utilizes a quadtree to hierarchically organize trajectories into\ndifferent quadtree nodes, and then applies a z-ordering to further organize the\ntrajectories by spatial locality inside each node. This structure is highly\neffective in pruning the trajectory search space, which is of independent\ninterest.

However, most algorithms are designed for faces in small to medium\nposes (yaw angle is smaller than 45 degrees), which lack the ability to align\nfaces in large poses up to 90 degrees. The challenges are three-fold. Firstly,\nthe commonly used landmark face model assumes that all the landmarks are\nvisible and is therefore not suitable for large poses. Secondly, the face\nappearance varies more drastically across large poses, from the frontal view to\nthe profile view. Thirdly, labelling landmarks in large poses is extremely\nchallenging since the invisible landmarks have to be guessed.

In\nnon-modulated mode, the device is highly nonlinear. Hence, all PyWFS\nimplementations on current AAO systems employ modulation to make the device\nmore linear. The upcoming era of 30-m class telescopes and the demand for\nultra-precise wavefront control stemming from science objectives that include\ndirect imaging of exoplanets make using the PyWFS without modulation desirable.\nThis article argues that nonlinear estimation based on Newton's method for\nnonlinear optimization can be useful for mitigating the effects of nonlinearity\nin the non-modulated PyWFS. The proposed approach requires all optical modeling\nto be pre-computed, which has the advantage of avoiding real-time simulations\nof beam propagation. Further, the required real-time calculations are amenable\nto massively parallel computation. Numerical experiments simulate a currently\noperational PyWFS. A singular value analysis shows that the common practice of\ncalculating two \"slope\" images from the four PyWFS pupil images discards\ncritical information and is unsuitable for the non-modulated PyWFS simulated\nhere. Instead, this article advocates estimators that use the raw pixel values\nnot only from the four geometrical images of the pupil, but from surrounding\npixels as well. The simulations indicate that nonlinear estimation can be\neffective when the Strehl ratio of the input beam is greater than 0.3, and the\nimprovement relative to linear estimation tends to increase at larger Strehl\nratios. At Strehl ratios less than about 0.5, the performances of both the\nnonlinear and linear estimators are relatively insensitive to noise, since they\nare dominated by nonlinearity error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 15:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

In this paper, we attempt to address this issue focusing on\nnontermination analysis of numerical software, where nontermination is often an\nunexpected behaviour of computer programs and may be problematic for\napplications such as real-time systems having hard deadlines on transaction\nexecution time, and propose a method for robust conditional nontermination\nanalysis, which can be used to under-approximate the maximal robust\nnontermination input set for a given program, from which the program never\nterminates, regardless of the aforementioned disturbances.

Recently there has been\nimpressive progress in experimental realizations as well. Here we study vacuum\nradiation when a field mode is driven both parametrically and by a classical\nsource. We find that in the Heisenberg picture the field operators of the mode\nundergo a Bogolyubov transformation combined with a displacement, in the\nSchr\\\"odinger picture the oscillator evolves from the vacuum to a squeezed\ncoherent state. Whereas the Bogolyubov transformation is the same as would be\nobtained if only the parametric drive were applied the displacement is\ndetermined by both the parametric drive and the force. If the force is applied\nwell after the parametric drive then the displacement is the same as would be\nobtained by the action of the force alone and it is essentially independent of\n$t_f$, the time lag between the application of the force and the parametric\ndrive. If the force is applied well before the parametric drive the\ndisplacement is found to oscillate as a function of $t_f$. This behavior can be\nunderstood in terms of quantum interference. A rich variety of behavior is\nobserved for intermediate values of $t_f$. The oscillations can turn off\nsmoothly or grow dramatically and decrease depending on strength of the\nparametric drive and force and the durations for which they are applied. The\ndisplacement depends only on the Fourier component of the force at a single\nresonant frequency when the forcing and the parametric drive are well separated\nin time. However for a weak parametric drive that is applied at the same time\nas the force we show that the displacement responds to a broad range of\nfrequencies of the force spectrum. Implications of our findings for experiments\nare briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 00:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

The trained CNN model over one dataset performs reasonably well\nwhereas on another dataset of similar type the hand-designed feature descriptor\noutperforms the same trained CNN model. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer\ndiscards some values in order to introduce the non-linearity. In this paper, it\nis proposed that the discriminative ability of deep image representation using\ntrained model can be improved by Average Biased ReLU (AB-ReLU) at the last few\nlayers. Basically, AB-ReLU improves the discriminative ability in two ways: 1)\nit exploits some of the discriminative and discarded negative information of\nReLU and 2) it also neglects the irrelevant and positive information used in\nReLU. The VGGFace model trained in MatConvNet over the VGG-Face dataset is used\nas the feature descriptor for face retrieval over other face datasets. The\nproposed approach is tested over six challenging, unconstrained and robust face\ndatasets (PubFig, LFW, PaSC, AR, FERET and ExtYale) and also on a large scale\nface dataset (PolyUNIR) in retrieval framework. It is observed that the AB-ReLU\noutperforms the ReLU when used with a pre-trained VGGFace model over the face\ndatasets. The validation error by training the network after replacing all\nReLUs with AB-ReLUs is also observed to be favorable over each dataset. The\nAB-ReLU even outperforms the state-of-the-art activation functions, such as\nSigmoid, ReLU, Leaky ReLU and Flexible ReLU over all seven face datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 15:03:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 04:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}
