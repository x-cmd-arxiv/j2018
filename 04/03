The slow\ndynamics is still a reduced-order multi-agent system consisting of a weighted\naverage of the vector fields of all agents, and some sub-dynamics of agents.\nThe weighted average is an emergent dynamics, which we call a blended dynamics.\nBy analyzing or synthesizing the blended dynamics, one can predict or design\nthe behavior of a heterogeneous multi-agent system when the coupling gain is\nsufficiently large. For this result, stability of the blended dynamics is\nrequired. Since stability of the individual agent is not asked, the stability\nof the blended dynamics is the outcome of trading off the stability among the\nagents. It can be seen that, under the stability of the blended dynamics, the\ninitial conditions of the individual agents are forgotten as time goes on, and\nthus, the behavior of the synthesized multi-agent system is initialization-free\nand is suitable for plug-and-play operation. As a showcase, we apply the\nproposed tool to four application problems; distributed state estimation for\nlinear systems, practical synchronization of heterogeneous Van der Pol\noscillators, estimation of the number of nodes in a network, and a problem of\ndistributed optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 17:35:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 06:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 08:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

First, the majority of the\noldest stars are not formed $\\textit{in situ}$ but are accreted during\nhierarchical assembly.

Inferring H2O in the solar system giant planets is\nchallenging, due to condensation depleting the upper atmosphere of water\nvapour. Substantially warmer hot Jupiter exoplanets readily allow detections of\nH2O via transmission spectroscopy, but such signatures are often diminished by\nthe presence of clouds made of other species. In contrast, highly scattering\nH2O clouds can brighten planets in reflected light, enhancing molecular\nsignatures. Here, we present an extensive parameter space survey of the\nprominence of H2O absorption features in reflection spectra of cool (Teff<400K)\ngiant exoplanetary atmospheres. The impact of effective temperature, gravity,\nmetallicity, and sedimentation efficiency is explored. We find prominent H2O\nfeatures around 0.94um, 0.83um, and across a wide spectral region from\n0.4-0.73um. The 0.94um feature is only detectable where high-altitude water\nclouds brighten the planet: T~150K, g>~20m/s^2, fsed>~3, m<~10xsolar. In\ncontrast, planets with g<~20m/s^2 and T>~180K display prominent H2O features\nembedded in the Rayleigh slope from 0.4-0.73um. High fsed enhances H2O features\naround 0.94um, and enables them to be detected at lower temperatures. High m\nresults in dampened H2O absorption features, due to H2O vapour condensing to\nform bright optically thick clouds that dominate the continuum. We verify these\ntrends via self-consistent modelling of the low gravity exoplanet HD 192310c,\nrevealing that its reflection spectrum is expected to be dominated by H2O\nabsorption from 0.4-0.73um for m<~10xsolar. Our results demonstrate that H2O is\nmanifestly detectable in reflected light spectra of cool giant planets only\nmarginally warmer than Jupiter, providing an avenue to directly constrain the\nC/O and O/H ratios of a hitherto unexplored population of exoplanetary\natmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

Radiation offers a probe of the interactions\nof the system, including Mott physics as well as non-linear Luttinger liquid\nbehavior. We show that these effects can be probed in current experiments on\neffectively one-dimensional electron liquids, such as carbon nanotubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 18:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

We\ndescribe a data placement method and a chunking-based algorithm for our kernels\nthat exploits the existence of the multiple memory spaces in each hardware\nplatform. We evaluate the performance of these methods w.r.t. standard\nalgorithms using the auto-caching mechanisms. Our results show that standard\nalgorithms that exploit cache reuse performed as well as multi-memory-aware\nalgorithms for architectures such as KNLs where the memory subsystems have\nsimilar latencies. However, for architectures such as GPUs where memory\nsubsystems differ significantly in both bandwidth and latency,\nmulti-memory-aware methods are crucial for good performance. In addition, our\nnew approaches permit the user to run problems that require larger capacities\nthan the fastest memory of each compute node without depending on the\nsoftware-managed cache mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 18:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

This idea works very well for the horse and cart but is\npuzzling if you apply it to a thrown stone or spear.

An archer or a spearman does not need a theory\nof projectile motion, just a great deal of practice. But once the gun was\ninvented it became important to know what angle a barrel should be oriented at\nand how much propellant to use, particularly as gunpowder was expensive.\nHowever, for many years afterwards the manufacturing techniques used meant that\ncannonballs were a loose fit to gun-barrels making cannons both inaccurate and\nof poor reproducibility shot-to-shot.

How to achieve fast computations by WENO methods for high spatial\ndimension PDEs is a challenging and important question. Recently, sparse-grid\nhas become a major approximation tool for high dimensional problems. The open\nquestion is how to design WENO computations on sparse grids such that\ncomparable high order accuracy of WENO schemes in smooth regions and\nessentially non-oscillatory stability in non-smooth regions of the solutions\ncan still be achieved as that for computations on regular single grids?

The gradual replacement of these machines by asynchronous\nrenewable-based generation, which provides little or no frequency control,\nincreases system uncertainty and the risk of instability. This imposes hard\nlimits on the proportion of renewables that can be integrated into the system.\nIn this paper we address this issue by developing a framework for performing\nfrequency control in power systems with arbitrary mixes of conventional and\nrenewable generation. Our approach is based on a robust stability criterion\nthat can be used to guarantee the stability of a full power system model on the\nbasis of a set of decentralised tests, one for each component in the system. It\ncan be applied even when using detailed heterogeneous component models, and can\nbe verified using several standard frequency response, state-space, and circuit\ntheoretic analysis tools. Furthermore the stability guarantees hold\nindependently of the operating point, and remain valid even as components are\nadded to and removed from the grid. By designing decentralised controllers for\nindividual components to meet these decentralised tests, every component can\ncontribute to the regulation of the system frequency in a simple and provable\nmanner.

In replicated storage systems,\nconsistency comes at the price of delay due to large-scale write and read\noperations. Many applications with low latency requirements tolerate data\nstaleness in order to provide high availability and low operation latency.\nUsing age of information as the staleness metric, we examine a data updating\nsystem in which real-time content updates are replicated and stored in a\nDynamo-style quorum- based distributed system. A source sends updates to all\nthe nodes in the system and waits for acknowledgements from the earliest subset\nof nodes, known as a write quorum. An interested client fetches the update from\nanother set of nodes, defined as a read quorum. We analyze the staleness-delay\ntradeoff in replicated storage by varying the write quorum size. With a larger\nwrite quorum, an instantaneous read is more likely to get the latest update\nwritten by the source. However, the age of the content written to the system is\nmore likely to become stale as the write quorum size increases. For shifted\nexponential distributed write delay, we derive the age optimized write quorum\nsize that balances the likelihood of reading the latest update and the\nfreshness of the latest update written by the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2018 21:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Climatic estimates range from\nhot to glacial, and inferred marine pH spans strongly alkaline to acidic.\nBetter understanding of early climate and ocean chemistry would improve our\nknowledge of the origin of life and its coevolution with the environment.

Our carbon cycle model\nincludes an empirically justified temperature and pH dependence of seafloor\nweathering, allowing the relative importance of continental and seafloor\nweathering to be evaluated. We find that the Archean climate was likely\ntemperate (0-50 {\\deg}C) due to the combined negative feedbacks of continental\nand seafloor weathering.

This evolution is driven by the secular decline of pCO2, which in\nturn is a consequence of increasing solar luminosity, but is moderated by\ncarbonate alkalinity delivered from continental and seafloor weathering.\nArchean seafloor weathering may have been a comparable carbon sink to\ncontinental weathering, but is less dominant than previously assumed, and would\nnot have induced global glaciation.

Previous research tackled this problem by either\nsearching for a 3D shape that best explains 2D annotations, or training purely\non synthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D\nINterpreter Networks (3D-INN), an end-to-end trainable framework that\nsequentially estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object skeletons and poses.\nOur system learns from both 2D-annotated real images and synthetic 3D data.\nThis is made possible mainly by two technical innovations. First, heatmaps of\n2D keypoints serve as an intermediate representation to connect real and\nsynthetic data. 3D-INN is trained on real images to estimate 2D keypoint\nheatmaps from an input image; it then predicts 3D object structure from\nheatmaps using knowledge learned from synthetic 3D shapes. By doing so, 3D-INN\nbenefits from the variation and abundance of synthetic 3D objects, without\nsuffering from the domain difference between real and synthesized images, often\ndue to imperfect rendering. Second, we propose a Projection Layer, mapping\nestimated 3D structure back to 2D. During training, it ensures 3D-INN to\npredict 3D structure whose projection is consistent with the 2D annotations to\nreal images. Experiments show that the proposed system performs well on both 2D\nkeypoint estimation and 3D structure recovery. We also demonstrate that the\nrecovered 3D information has wide vision applications, such as image retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 01:55:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 23:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

This involves both detecting and describing events.\nTherefore, all previous methods on dense video captioning tackle this problem\nby building two models, i.e. an event proposal and a captioning model, for\nthese two sub-problems. The models are either trained separately or in\nalternation. This prevents direct influence of the language description to the\nevent proposal, which is important for generating accurate descriptions. To\naddress this problem, we propose an end-to-end transformer model for dense\nvideo captioning. The encoder encodes the video into appropriate\nrepresentations. The proposal decoder decodes from the encoding with different\nanchors to form video event proposals. The captioning decoder employs a masking\nnetwork to restrict its attention to the proposal event over the encoding\nfeature. This masking network converts the event proposal to a differentiable\nmask, which ensures the consistency between the proposal and captioning during\ntraining. In addition, our model employs a self-attention mechanism, which\nenables the use of efficient non-recurrent structure during encoding and leads\nto performance improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nend-to-end model on ActivityNet Captions and YouCookII datasets, where we\nachieved 10.12 and 6.58 METEOR score, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 04:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

To this end, we first\ngenerate category vectors, which represent the semantics of ODP categories by\njointly modeling word embeddings and the ODP-based text classification. We then\npropose a novel semantic similarity measure, which utilizes the category and\nword vectors obtained from the joint model and word embeddings, respectively.\nThe evaluation results clearly show the efficacy of our methodology in\nlarge-scale text classification. The proposed scheme exhibits significant\nimprovements of 10% and 28% in terms of macro-averaging F1-score and precision\nat k, respectively, over state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 05:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

We found two competing models that explain\nthe observed light curves with companion/host mass ratios of q~0.01 and ~0.17,\nrespectively. From the measurement of finite source effects in the best-fit\nplanetary model, we find a relatively small angular Einstein radius of theta_E\n~ 0.03 mas which favors a low mass lens.

Presence of stochastic noise in the biochemical pathway of the\ncell has important consequence on the switching mechanism of motor bias, which\nin turn affects the runs and tumbles of the cell. We model the intra-cellular\nreaction network in terms of coupled time-evolution of three stochastic\nvariables, kinase activity, methylation level and CheY-P protein level, and\nstudy the effect of methylation noise on the chemotactic performance of the\ncell. In presence of a spatially varying nutrient concentration profile, a good\nchemotactic performance allows the cell to climb up the concentration gradient\nfast and localize in the nutrient-rich regions in the long time limit. Our\nsimulations show that the best performance is obtained at an optimal noise\nstrength. While it is expected that chemotaxis will be weaker for very large\nnoise, it is counter-intuitive that the performance worsens even when noise\nlevel falls below a certain value. We explain this striking result by detailed\nanalysis of CheY-P protein level statistics for different noise strengths. We\nshow that when the CheY-P level falls below a certain (noise-dependent)\nthreshold, the cell tends to move down the concentration gradient of the\nnutrient, which has a detrimental effect on its chemotactic response. This\nthreshold value decreases as noise is increased, and this effect is responsible\nfor noise-induced enhancement of chemotactic performance. In a harsh chemical\nenvironment, when the nutrient degrades with time, the amount of nutrient\nintercepted by the cell trajectory, is an effective performance criterion. In\nthis case also, we find an optimum noise strength, depending on the nutrient\nlifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 05:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

The van der\nWaals (vdW) attractive force between quintuple layers is interpreted being\ncoming from the anti-ferroelectrically ordered effective electric dipoles which\nare constructed with pi-bond trimer pairs on Se-layers across the vdW gap of\nminimized Coulomb repulsion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 06:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

Here, we argue that two measures\nare enough to capture a wealth of different forms of the population density.\nFirst, fluctuations of the local density can be very important and we should\ndistinguish almost homogeneous cities from highly heterogeneous ones. This is\neasily characterized by an indicator such as the Gini coefficient $G$, or\nequivalently by the relative standard deviation or the entropy. The second\nimportant dimension is the spatial organization of the heterogeneities in\npopulation density and we propose a dispersion index $\\eta$ that characterizes\nthe degree of localization of highly populated areas. We argue that these two\ndimensions are enough to characterize the spatial organization of cities, and\nwe discuss this approach using a dataset of about $4,500$ cities belonging to\nthe $10$ largest urban areas in France, for which we have high resolution data.\nRepresenting cities in the plane $(G,\\eta)$ allows us to construct families of\ncities.

Unlike the traditional\njamming attack, this attack, when perfectly executed, cannot be detected at the\nreceiver using signal-to-noise-ratio measurements.

A pressure maximum can be formed\noutside the gap where solids that are loosely coupled to the gas, typically in\nthe pebble size range, can be trapped. The minimum planet mass for building\nsuch a trap, which is called the pebble isolation mass (PIM), is important for\ntwo reasons: it marks the end of planetary growth by pebble accretion, and the\ntrapped dust forms a ring that may be observed with millimetre observations. We\nstudy the effect of disk turbulence on the pebble isolation mass and find its\ndependence on the gas turbulent viscosity, aspect ratio, and particles Stokes\nnumber. By means of 2D gas hydrodynamical simulations, we found the minimum\nplanet mass to form a radial pressure maximum beyond the orbit of the planet,\nwhich is the necessary condition to trap pebbles. We then carried out 2D gas\nplus dust hydrodynamical simulations to examine how dust turbulent diffusion\nimpacts particles trapping at the pressure maximum. We finally provide a\nsemi-analytical calculation of the PIM based on comparing the radial drift\nvelocity of solids and the root mean square turbulent velocity fluctuations\naround the pressure maximum. From our results of gas simulations, we provide an\nexpression for the PIM versus disk aspect ratio and turbulent viscosity. Our\ngas plus dust simulations show that the effective PIM can be nearly an order of\nmagnitude larger in high-viscosity disks because turbulence diffuse particles\nout of the pressure maximum. This is quantified by our semi-analytical\ncalculation, which gives an explicit dependence of the PIM with Stokes number\nof particles. We conclude than disk turbulence can significantly alter the PIM,\ndepending on the level of turbulence in regions of planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 12:09:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 15:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

These interactions can\nbe abstracted as patterns of connections among distinct units such as genes,\nproteins, individual organisms, or species which form a hierarchy of biological\norganisation. Connections in this hierarchy are arranged in a nested structure:\ngene and protein networks shape phenotypic traits and together constitute\nindividuals, individuals are embedded within populations, populations within\ncommunities, and communities within ecosystems. This pervasive \"nestedness\" of\nnetworks can result in propagation of the effects from within-level\ninteractions at one level to units at higher or lower levels of organization.\nThe concept of nested biological networks is implicit in a variety of\ndisciplines ranging from the study of genetic circuits regulating phenotypic\ntrait expression (Babu et al. 2004), to the study of predator-prey interactions\ninfluencing community composition (Poisot et al. 2016). However, studies\ntypically only address interactions within and among directly neighbouring\nhierarchical levels, such as genotypes and phenotypic traits, or populations\nand communities. Here, we formalise nested networks as having nodes that can\ncontain, or be embedded in, other nodes, and where edges can bridge connections\nbetween sets of embedded nodes. We then argue that explicitly accounting for\nnetwork nestedness across levels of organization will encourage integrative\nthinking on new interdisciplinary research fronts. We focus on two phenomena in\nparticular: (i) indirect connections among units can arise from the structure\nof connections at higher or lower levels of organisation, (ii) the propagation\nof effects across neighbouring hierarchical levels of organization. This\nframework of nested interaction networks provides a tool for researchers across\ndisciplines to conceptualize their work as elements on a common scaffold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 12:21:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

For video transmission, unreliable connectivity\nmay cause significant degradation of the content. Improving or keeping video\nquality over lossy channel is therefore a very important research topic. Error\nconcealment with data hiding (ECDH) is an effective way to conceal the errors\nintroduced by channels. It can reduce error propagation between neighbor\nblocks/frames comparing with the methods exploiting temporal/spatial\ncorrelations. The existing video ECDH methods often embed the motion vectors\n(MVs) into the specific locations. Nevertheless, specific embedding locations\ncannot resist against random errors. To compensate the unreliable connectivity\nin mobile cloud environment, in this paper, we present a video ECDH scheme\nusing 3D reversible data hiding (RDH), in which each MV is repeated multiple\ntimes, and the repeated MVs are embedded into different macroblocks (MBs)\nrandomly. Though the multiple embedding requires more embedding space,\nsatisfactory trade-off between the introduced distortion and the reconstructed\nvideo quality can be achieved by tuning the repeating times of the MVs. For\nrandom embedding, the lost probability of the MVs decreases rapidly, resulting\nin better error concealment performance. Experimental results show that the\nPSNR values gain about 5dB at least comparing with the existing ECDH methods.\nMeanwhile, the proposed method improves the video quality significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 12:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

To extract the 3D\nposition of specific DLs, their 2D position in multiple weak-beam dark-field\nTEM micrographs, recorded at different tilt angles, is fitted. From this fit\nthe geometric centre and size of each DL in each micrograph can be extracted.\nUsing a forward prediction approach each specific DL is identified in all the\n2D projections.

Therefore, we present mRUBiS, an extensible exemplar for model-based\narchitectural self-healing and self-optimization. mRUBiS simulates the\nadaptable software and therefore provides and maintains an architectural\nruntime model of the software, which can be directly used by adaptation engines\nto realize and perform self-adaptation. Particularly, mRUBiS supports injecting\nissues into the model, which should be handled by self-adaptation, and\nvalidating the model to assess the self-adaptation. Finally, mRUBiS allows\ndevelopers to explore variants of adaptation engines (e.g., event-driven\nself-adaptation) and to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability\nof the engines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 13:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

First, according to the Cartan-Dieudonn\\'e theorem, every rotation\nmatrix can be written as an even number of reflections.

As a\nconsequence, it cannot be fully described by just one action of the exponential\nmap on its Lie algebra. Instead, we obtain an Iwasawa-type decomposition for\nthis group in terms of three exponentials acting on three direct summands of\nthe corresponding Lie algebra of supermatrices.\n  At the same time, SO${}_0$ strictly contains the group generated by\nsuper-vector reflections. Therefore, its Lie algebra is isomorphic to a certain\nextension of the algebra of superbivectors. This means that the Spin group in\nthis setting has to be seen as the group generated by the exponentials of the\nso-called extended superbivectors in order to cover SO${}_0$.

A pronounced enhancement of the pseudogap under\npressure of dln{\\Delta}*/dP= 0.32, which is only a factor of 1.12 smaller than\nin slightly doped single crystals, is revealed for the first time. This implies\na somewhat more moderate increase of the coupling strength in optimally doped\ncuprates with increasing pressure. Simultaneously, the ratio\n2{\\Delta}*(T_c)/k_BT_c=5 at P=0 GPa, which is typical for high-temperature\nsuperconductors with strong coupling, increases by 16% with increasing\npressure.

During their journey to perihelion, comets may appear in the\nfield-of-view of space-borne optical instruments, showing in some cases a\nnicely developed plasma tail extending from their coma and exhibiting an\noscillatory behaviour.

Therefore, it is possible to exploit these\noscillations in order to infer the value of the Strouhal number $St$, which\nquantifies the vortex shedding phenomenon, and the physical properties of the\nlocal medium. Methods. We used the Heliospheric Imager (HI) data of the Solar\nTErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission to study the oscillations of\nthe tails of the comets 2P/Encke and C/2012 S1 (ISON) during their perihelion\nin Nov 2013, determining the Strouhal numbers from the estimates of the halo\nsize, the relative speed of the solar wind flow and the period of the\noscillations.

Such combinatorial constraints in system design\nand implementation can be captured using a structure known as matroids. In\nparticular, the algebraic structure of matroids can be exploited to develop\nscalable algorithms for sensor and actuator selection, along with quantifiable\napproximation bounds. However, in large-scale systems, sensors and actuators\nmay fail or may be (cyber-)attacked. The objective of this paper is to focus on\nresilient matroid-constrained problems arising in control and sensing but in\nthe presence of sensor and actuator failures. In general, resilient\nmatroid-constrained problems are computationally hard. Contrary to the\nnon-resilient case (with no failures), even though they often involve objective\nfunctions that are monotone or submodular, no scalable approximation algorithms\nare known for their solution. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm,\nthat also has the following properties: First, it achieves system-wide\nresiliency, i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service\nattacks or failures. Second, it is scalable, as our algorithm terminates with\nthe same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for (non-resilient)\nmatroid-constrained optimization. Third, it provides provable approximation\nbounds on the system performance, since for monotone objective functions our\nalgorithm guarantees a solution close to the optimal. We quantify our\nalgorithm's approximation performance using a notion of curvature for monotone\n(not necessarily submodular) set functions.

Inverse dynamics\ncontrol and feedforward linearization techniques are typically used to convert\nthe complex nonlinear dynamics of Lagrangian systems to a set of decoupled\ndouble integrators, and then a standard, outer-loop controller can be used to\ncalculate the commanded acceleration for the linearized system. However, these\nmethods typically depend on having a very accurate system model, which is often\nnot available in practice. While this challenge has been addressed in the\nliterature using different learning approaches, most of these approaches do not\nprovide safety guarantees in terms of stability of the learning-based control\nsystem. In this paper, we provide a novel, learning-based control approach\nbased on Gaussian processes (GPs) that ensures both stability of the\nclosed-loop system and high-accuracy tracking. We use GPs to approximate the\nerror between the commanded acceleration and the actual acceleration of the\nsystem, and then use the predicted mean and variance of the GP to calculate an\nupper bound on the uncertainty of the linearized model. This uncertainty bound\nis then used in a robust, outer-loop controller to ensure stability of the\noverall system. Moreover, we show that the tracking error converges to a ball\nwith a radius that can be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, we verify the\neffectiveness of our approach via simulations on a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF)\nplanar manipulator and experimentally on a 6 DOF industrial manipulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 15:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 16:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

In this work,\ndelivery of an interactive multiview video to a set of wireless users is\nstudied in an heterogeneous cellular network.

Here the challenge of nanofabrication\ninside a microfluidic chip is tackled for the showcase of a spider-inspired\nspinneret. Multiphoton lithography, an additive manufacturing method, was used\nto produce free-form microfluidic masters, subsequently replicated by soft\nlithography. Into the resulting microfluidic device, a threedimensional\nspider-inspired spinneret was directly fabricated in-chip via multiphoton\nlithography. Applying this unprecedented fabrication strategy, the to date\nsmallest printed spinneret nozzle is produced. This spinneret resides tightly\nsealed, connecting it to the macroscopic world. Its functionality is\ndemonstrated by wet-spinning of single-digit micron fibres through a\npolyacrylonitrile coagulation process induced by a water sheath layer. The\nmethodology developed here demonstrates fabrication strategies to interface\ncomplex architectures into classical microfluidic platforms. Using multiphoton\nlithography for in-chip fabrication adopts a high spatial resolution technology\nfor improving geometry and thus flow control inside microfluidic chips.

We focus on a low-recombination regime, where the evolutionary\nhistory can be described by a directed acyclic graph called a galled tree,\nwhich differs from a tree only by isolated topological defects. We show that in\nthis regime, under a complete sampling assumption, the $1^\\mathrm{st}$ barcode\nyields a lower bound on the novelty profile, and hence on the number of\nrecombination events. For $i>1$, the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ barcode is empty. In\naddition, we use a stability principle to strengthen these results to ones\nwhich hold for any subsample of an arbitrary evolutionary history. To establish\nthese results, we describe the topology of the Vietoris--Rips filtrations\narising from evolutionary histories indexed by galled trees. As a step towards\na probabilistic theory, we also show that for a random history indexed by a\nfixed galled tree and satisfying biologically reasonable conditions, the\nintervals of the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ barcode are independent random variables.\nUsing simulations, we explore the sensitivity of these intervals to\nrecombination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 14:56:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Detecting emotions like anger could provide a clue for the robot\nindicating unsafe/undesired situations. Recently, several deep neural\nnetwork-based models have been proposed which establish new state-of-the-art\nresults in affective state evaluation. These models typically start processing\nat the end of each utterance, which not only requires a mechanism to detect the\nend of an utterance but also makes it difficult to use them in a real-time\ncommunication scenario, e.g. human-robot interaction. We propose the EmoRL\nmodel that triggers an emotion classification as soon as it gains enough\nconfidence while listening to a person speaking. As a result, we minimize the\nneed for segmenting the audio signal for classification and achieve lower\nlatency as the audio signal is processed incrementally. The method is\ncompetitive with the accuracy of a strong baseline model, while allowing much\nearlier prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 09:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

This paper improves the\nperformance of the LL algorithm by additionally incorporating a machine\nlearning approach, using a conceptually simple supervised na\\\"ive Bayes (NB)\nclassifier. Based on a sequence of historical network snapshots, this predicts\nthe potential future circuit blocking probability between each node pair. These\nsnapshots are taken for each service request arriving to the network and record\nthe number of busy capacity units on each link at that instant. The candidate\nroute for serving a current service request is based on both the link loads and\nthe potential future blocking probability of the entire network in case this\nroute is indeed used. The performance of this proposed approach is studied via\nsimulations and compared with both the conventional LL algorithm and the\nShortest Path (SP) based approach. Results indicate that the proposed\nsupervised na\\\"ive Bayes classifier-assisted LL routing algorithm significantly\nreduces blocking probability of service connection requests and outperforms\nboth the conventional LL and SP routing algorithms. To enable the learning\nprocess based on a large number of network snapshots, we also develop a\nparallel computing framework to implement parallel learning and performance\nevaluation. Also, a network control system supporting na\\\"ive Bayes\nclassifier-assisted LL routing algorithm is addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 04:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

To the order $1-q$, the momentum\ndistribution derived by using the density operator coincides with the momentum\ndistribution derived from the entropic measure described with the distribution,\nwhen the physical temperature equals the temperature in the distribution\nderived from the entropic measure. The correlation depends on the momentums for\n$q \\neq 1$.

Here we start\nfrom the relativistic Dirac equation and, performing a Foldy-Wouthuysen\ntransformation, derive a generalised Pauli spin Hamiltonian that contains\nrelativistic correction terms to any higher order. Using the Heisenberg\nequation of spin motion we derive general relativistic expressions for the\ntensorial Gilbert damping and magnetic inertia parameters, and show that these\ntensors can be expressed as series of higher-order relativistic correction\nterms.
