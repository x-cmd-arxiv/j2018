While scholars advocate for the use\nof a Bayes factor to quantify the weight of forensic evidence, it is often\nimpossible to assign the necessary probability measures to perform\nlikelihood-based inference for high-dimensional and complex data. To address\nthis issue, we revisit a two-stage inference framework and leverage the\nproperties of kernel functions to offer a method that allows for statistically\nsupporting the inference of the identity of source of sets of trace and control\nobjects by way of a single test. Our method is generic in that it can be easily\ntailored to any type of data encountered in forensic science or pattern\nrecognition, and our method does not depend on the dimension or the type of the\nconsidered data. The application of our method to paint evidence shows that\nthis type of evidence carries substantial probative value. Finally, our\napproach can easily be extended to other evidence types such as glass, fibres\nand dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 16:04:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:40:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 03:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

Overall two types of sprays are formed: Type I, which is\na cloud of droplets and ligaments generated at the impact of the plate's\nleading edge with the water surface, and Type II, which is formed after the\ntrailing edge of the plate enters the local water surface. Detailed analysis of\nthe experimental data for the Type II spray revealed that the spray envelopes\nand root point trajectories are independent of Froude number close to the\ntrailing edge, while further away reach higher vertical positions for larger\nFroude numbers. The numerical simulation captures the general behavior of the\nType II spray and agrees favorably with the experimental results.

We investigate orbital evolution of planetary embryos in disks\nthat viscously evolve under the effects of disk winds. The aim is to discuss\neffects of altered disk profiles on type I migration.

This is\nbecause the gas surface density is decreased and has a flatter profile in the\nclose-in region due to disk winds.

However, due to intrinsic\nnonlocality of the dielectric response of the metals along with their inherent\nloss, the achievable field enhancement has an ultimate constraint. In this\npaper we demonstrate that combining plasmonic resonance enhancements from\noligomers, with feature size of tens of nanometers, with a Rayleigh anomaly\ncaused by a 1-D set of periodic nanorods, having a period on the order of the\nexcitation wavelength, provides a mean to produce enhancement beyond that\nconstrained by losses in near field resonances.

If this is the case, then the\npresence of supernova ejecta and stellar winds provide a changing dispersion\nmeasure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that can potentially be probes of the\nenvironments of FRB progenitors. Here we summarize the scalings for the DM and\nRM in the cases of a constant density ambient medium and of a progenitor\nstellar wind. Since the amount of ionized material is controlled by the\ndynamics of the reverse shock, we find the DM changes more slowly than in\nprevious simpler work, which simply assumed a constant ionization fraction.\nFurthermore, the DM can be constant or even increasing as the supernova remnant\nsweeps up material, arguing that a young neutron star hypothesis for FRBs is\nnot ruled out if the DM is not decreasing over repeated bursts. The combined DM\nand RM measurements for the repeating FRB 121102 are consistent with supernova\nejecta with an age of $\\sim10^2-10^3\\,{\\rm yrs}$ expanding into a high density\n($\\sim100\\,{\\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium.

The key ideas behind RMC are as\nfollows. First, under any reasonable policy, the reward process is ergodic. So,\nby renewal theory, the performance of a policy is equal to the ratio of\nexpected discounted reward to the expected discounted time over a regenerative\ncycle. Second, by carefully examining the expression for performance gradient,\nwe propose a stochastic approximation algorithm that only requires estimates of\nthe expected discounted reward and discounted time over a regenerative cycle\nand their gradients.

The colloidal networks\nin these materials can exist in a mode of free settling when the network weight\nexceeds its compressive yield stress. An equivalent state occurs when the\nnetwork is held fixed in place and used as a filter through which the\nsuspending fluid is pumped. In either scenario, hydrodynamic instabilities\nleading to loss of network integrity occur. Experimental observations have\nshown that the loss of integrity is associated with the formation of eroded\nchannels, so-called streamers, through which the fluid flows rapidly. However,\nthe dynamics of growth and subsequent mechanism of collapse remain poorly\nunderstood. Here, a phenomenological model is presented that describes\ndynamically the radial growth of a streamer due to erosion of the network by\nrapid fluid back flow. The model exhibits a finite-time blowup -- the onset of\ncatastrophic failure in the gel -- due to activated breaking of the\ninter-colloid bonds. Brownian dynamics simulations of hydrodynamically\ninteracting and settling colloids in dilute gels are employed to examine the\ninitiation and propagation of this instability, which is in good agreement with\nthe theory. The model dynamics are also shown to accurately replicate\nmeasurements of streamer growth in two different experimental systems.

Different position-based protocols use different strategies to pick\nthe neighbor to forward the packet.

However, as we move to higher\nresolution simulations a variety of codes have encountered what has been termed\nthe convection conundrum. As these simulations increase in resolution and hence\nthe level of turbulence achieved, they tend to produce weak or even anti-solar\ndifferential rotation patterns associated with a weak rotational influence\n(high Rossby number) due to large convective velocities. One potential culprit\nfor this convection conundrum is the upper boundary condition applied in most\nsimulations which is generally impenetrable. Here we present an alternative\nstochastic plume boundary condition which imposes small-scale convective plumes\ndesigned to mimic near-surface convective downflows, thus allowing convection\nto carry the majority of the outward solar energy flux up to and through our\nsimulated upper boundary. The use of a plume boundary condition leads to\nsignificant changes in the convective driving realized in the simulated domain\nand thus to the convective energy transport, the dominant scale of the\nconvective enthalpy flux, and the relative strength of the strongest downflows,\nthe downflow network, and the convective upflows. These changes are present\neven far from the upper boundary layer. Additionally, we demonstrate that in\nspite of significant changes, giant cell morphology in the convective patterns\nis still achieved with self-organization of the imposed boundary plumes into\ndownflow lanes, cellular patterns, and even rotationally-aligned banana cells\nin equatorial regions. This plume boundary presents an alternative pathway for\n3D global convection simulations where driving is non-local and may provide a\nnew approach towards addressing the convection conundrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 20:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

We develop a method to recover a gene network's\nstructure from co-expression data, measured in terms of normalized Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficients between gene pairs. We treat these co-expression\nmeasurements as weights in the complete graph in which nodes correspond to\ngenes. To decide which edges exist in the gene network, we fit a\nthree-component mixture model such that the observed weights of `null edges'\nfollow a normal distribution with mean 0, and the non-null edges follow a\nmixture of two lognormal distributions, one for positively- and one for\nnegatively-correlated pairs. We show that this so-called L2N mixture model\noutperforms other methods in terms of power to detect edges, and it allows us\nto control the false discovery rate. Importantly, the method makes no\nassumptions about the true network structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 22:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 19:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 20:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Preventable readmissions have been identified as one of the primary\ntargets for reducing costs and improving healthcare delivery. However, most\ndata driven studies for understanding readmissions have produced black box\nclassification and predictive models with moderate performance, which precludes\nthem from being used effectively within the decision support systems in the\nhospitals. In this paper we present an application of structured\nsparsity-inducing norms for predicting readmission risk for patients based on\ntheir disease history and demographics. Most existing studies have focused on\nhospital utilization, test results, etc., to assign a readmission label to each\nepisode of hospitalization. However, we focus on assigning a readmission risk\nlabel to a patient based on their disease history. Our emphasis is on\ninterpreting the models to improve the understanding of the readmission\nproblem. To achieve this, we exploit the domain induced hierarchical structure\navailable for the disease codes which are the features for the classification\nalgorithm. We use a tree based sparsity-inducing regularization strategy that\nexplicitly uses the domain hierarchy. The resulting model not only outperforms\nstandard regularization procedures but is also highly sparse and interpretable.\nWe analyze the model and identify several significant factors that have an\neffect on readmission risk. Some of these factors conform to existing beliefs,\ne.g., impact of surgical complications and infections during hospital stay.\nOther factors, such as the impact of mental disorder and substance abuse on\nreadmission, provide empirical evidence for several pre-existing but unverified\nhypotheses. The analysis also reveals previously undiscovered connections such\nas the influence of socioeconomic factors like lack of housing and\nmalnutrition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 22:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

The central idea of this approach is to obtain the 2-electron MO\nintegrals by direct integration of 2-electron coordinates. This method does not\nrequire or use pre-computed AO integrals and the value of the MOs at any point\nin space is obtained directly from the linear combination of AOs. The\nintegration over the electronic coordinates was performed using stratified\nsampling Monte Carlo method. This approach was implemented by dividing the\nintegration region into a set of non-overlapping segments and performing Monte\nCarlo calculations on each segment. The Monte Carlo sampling points for each\nsegment were optimized to minimize the total variance of the sample mean.\nAdditional variance reduction of the overall calculations was achieved by\nintroducing control-variate in the stratified sampling scheme. The composite\naspect of the CCSS allows for simultaneous computation of multiple MO integrals\nduring the stratified sampling evaluation. The main advantage of the CCSS\nmethod is that unlike rejection sampling Monte Carlo methods such as Metropolis\nalgorithm, the stratified sampling uses all instances of the calculated\nfunctions for the evaluation of the sample mean. The CCSS method is designed to\nbe used for large systems where AO-to-MO transformation is computationally\nprohibitive. Because it is based on numerical integration, the CCSS method can\nbe applied to a wide variety of integration kernels and does not require\n\\textit{a priori} knowledge of analytical integrals.

To shed light on these puzzles, we investigate the\nphase space near this resonance with use of Poincar\\'e sections of the circular\nplanar restricted three body model.

The\nprimary contribution of this work is that two adversarial networks are\nleveraged to maximize the semantic correlation and consistency of the\nrepresentations between different modalities. In addition, we harness a\nself-supervised semantic network to discover high-level semantic information in\nthe form of multi-label annotations. Such information guides the feature\nlearning process and preserves the modality relationships in both the common\nsemantic space and the Hamming space.

Two quantities are introduced, the noise\nbarrier and the large scale bias, that provides insights on the performance of\nthese convex regularized estimators. It is now well understood that the Lasso\nachieves fast prediction rates, provided that the correlations of the design\nsatisfy some Restricted Eigenvalue or Compatibility condition, and provided\nthat the tuning parameter is large enough. Using the two quantities introduced\nin the paper, we show that the compatibility condition on the design matrix is\nactually unavoidable to achieve fast prediction rates with the Lasso. The Lasso\nmust incur a loss due to the correlations of the design matrix, measured in\nterms of the compatibility constant. This results holds for any design matrix,\nany active subset of covariates, and any tuning parameter. It is now well known\nthat the Lasso enjoys a dimension reduction property: the prediction error is\nof order $\\lambda\\sqrt k$ where $k$ is the sparsity; even if the ambient\ndimension $p$ is much larger than $k$. Such results require that the tuning\nparameters is greater than some universal threshold. We characterize sharp\nphase transitions for the tuning parameter of the Lasso around a critical\nthreshold dependent on $k$. If $\\lambda$ is equal or larger than this critical\nthreshold, the Lasso is minimax over $k$-sparse target vectors. If $\\lambda$ is\nequal or smaller than critical threshold, the Lasso incurs a loss of order\n$\\sigma\\sqrt k$ --which corresponds to a model of size $k$-- even if the target\nvector has fewer than $k$ nonzero coefficients.

In the\nproposed model, we introduce a new distributed fog computing coordinator, which\nperiodically gathers information of fog computing nodes, e.g., remaining\nresources, tasks, etc. Moreover, the fog computing coordinator also manages\njobs so that all computing nodes can collaborate on complex tasks. In addition,\nwe construct a working prototype of intelligent electric vehicle service to\nevaluate the proposed model. Experiment results are also presented to\ndemonstrate that our proposed model exceed the traditional fog computing\nschemes for IoT applications in the smart grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 05:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

The planning based strategy aims to\nfind the global optimal passing order, but it is time-consuming when the number\nof considered vehicles is large. In contrast, the ad hoc negotiation based\nstrategy runs fast, but it always finds a local optimal solution. In this\npaper, we propose a grouping based cooperative driving strategy to make a good\ntradeoff between time consumption and coordination performance. The key idea is\nto fix the passing orders for some vehicles whose inter-vehicle headways are\nsmall enough (e.g., smaller than the pre-selected grouping threshold). From the\nviewpoint of optimization, this method reduces the size of the solution space.\nA brief analysis shows that the sub-optimal passing order found by the grouping\nbased strategy has a high probability to be close to the global optimal passing\norder, if the grouping threshold is appropriately chosen.

Furthermore, few studies have addressed the case in which the\nremnant is a magnetic white dwarf with a mass larger than the Chandrasekhar\nlimiting mass. Angular momentum losses might bring the remnant of the merger to\nthe physical conditions suitable for developing a thermonuclear explosion.\nAlternatively, the remnant may be prone to gravitational or rotational\ninstabilities, depending on the initial conditions reached after the\ncoalescence. Dipole magnetic braking is one of the mechanisms that can drive\nsuch losses of angular momentum. However, the timescale on which these losses\noccur depend on several parameters, like the strength of the magnetic field. In\naddition, the coalescence leaves a surrounding Keplerian disk that can be\naccreted by the newly formed white dwarf.

The slots in the proposed structure are\nplaced on the centerline of the broad wall of the substrate integrated\nwaveguide (SIW), in order to reduce cross polarization. Also, the asymmetric\nfield distributions on both sides of each slot, which are required for making\nradiation possible, are realized through using ridges close to the narrow walls\nof the SIW. The admittance of a single slot in the proposed structure is\nobtained regarding the different values of the main parameters of the\nstructure. An eight-element longitudinal slot array antenna on the broad wall\nof the RSIW is designed based on Elliots design procedure. In this design,\ninternal and external mutual coupling effects are taken into account through\ncalculating the active admittance for each slot of the array. A 2D graph is\npresented which contains the real and imaginary parts of the equivalent\nadmittance of a slot based on the changes in the widths of the ridges and\nlength of the slot. Using this graph, the widths of the ridges and length of\nthe slot can be revised in a way that the mutual coupling effect is taken into\naccount. Since the array antenna is composed of collinear elements, it\ndemonstrates a better cross polarization and isolation in comparison with\nconventional slot array antennas.

In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that\npathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose\nthe use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory. We\npropose to measure these deviations using two different metrics: uncertainty in\na Gaussian process regression model and a newly proposed age weighted\nuncertainty measure.

The capability of\nconforming to curved surfaces opens the door to add electronic components to\nminiaturized instruments, where size and weight are critical parameters. Given\ntheir prevalence on the sensors market, flexible magnetic sensors play a major\nrole in this progress. For many high-performance applications, magnetic tunnel\njunctions (MTJs) have become the first choice, due to their high sensitivity,\nlow power consumption etc. MTJs are also promising candidates for non-volatile\nnext-generation data storage media and, hence, could become central components\nof wearable electronic devices. In this work, a generic low-cost regenerative\nbatch fabrication process is utilized to transform rigid MTJs on a 500 {\\mu}m\nsilicon wafer substrate into 5 {\\mu}m thin, mechanically flexible silicon\ndevices, and ensuring optimal utilization of the whole substrate. This method\nmaintains the outstanding magnetic properties, which are only obtained by\ndeposition of the MTJ on smooth high-quality silicon wafers.

Bending of the MTJ\nstacks with a diameter as small as 500 {\\mu}m is possible without compromising\ntheir performance and an endurance of over 1000 cycles without fatigue has been\ndemonstrated.

A new method, based on a Bayesian\napproach, was applied for the first time to solar activity reconstruction.

We first highlight the power and limitations of its distinguishing\noperators (i.e., hypermutations with mutation potential and ageing) by\nanalysing them in isolation. Recent work has shown that ageing combined with\nlocal mutations can help escape local optima on a dynamic optimisation\nbenchmark function. We generalise this result by rigorously proving that,\ncompared to evolutionary algorithms (EAs), ageing leads to impressive speed-ups\non the standard Cliff benchmark function both when using local and global\nmutations. Unless the stop at first constructive mutation (FCM) mechanism is\napplied, we show that hypermutations require exponential expected runtime to\noptimise any function with a polynomial number of optima. If instead FCM is\nused, the expected runtime is at most a linear factor larger than the upper\nbound achieved for any random local search algorithm using the artificial\nfitness levels method. Nevertheless, we prove that algorithms using\nhypermutations can be considerably faster than EAs at escaping local optima. An\nanalysis of the complete Opt-IA reveals that it is efficient on the previously\nconsidered functions and highlights problems where the use of the full\nalgorithm is crucial. We complete the picture by presenting a class of\nfunctions for which Opt-IA fails with overwhelming probability while standard\nEAs are efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 09:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 14:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

In the linear regime, localised states may arise due\nto a lack of symmetry, as for example induced by inhomogeneities. However, when\nstructures deviate from the linear behaviour, e.g. due to material\nnonlinearities, geometric nonlinearities like large deformations, or other\nnonlinear elements like joints or friction interfaces, localised states may\narise even in perfectly symmetric structures. In this paper, a system\nconsisting of coupled Duffing oscillators with linear viscous damping is\nsubjected to external travelling wave forcing. The system may be considered a\nminimal model for bladed disks in turbomachinery operating in the nonlinear\nregime, where such excitation may arise due to imbalance or aerodynamic\nexcitation. We demonstrate that near the resonance, in this non-conservative\nregime, localised vibration states bifurcate from the travelling waves. Complex\nbifurcation diagrams result, comprising stable and unstable dissipative\nsolitons. The localised solutions can also be continued numerically to a\nconservative limit, where solitons bifurcate from the backbone curves of the\ntravelling waves at finite amplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 09:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

This article is dedicated to draft a theoretical category on\ninterpreting the mechanisms lying behind all soft matters, which can be termed\nas Softening Theory. A technical strategy with generalized purpose was proposed\nfor softening desired matter, i.e. the melting point of matter can be\nsignificantly reduced through tuning its interior boundaries in atomic level.\nThis theory accords well with the classical nuclear droplet model that treats\nthe nucleus as a droplet which had successfully explained many phenomena. It\nalso explained the experimental fact that, the material's melting point is\ndrastically reduced as the particles become smaller enough, in which situations\neffects of the atomic borders become much weaker. Along this direction, many\nphenomena existing in nature can be well understood. For example, if keeping in\nmind the fact that an atom consisting of nucleus and electronics can be\nregarded as fluid, all the matter consisted of atoms should maintain fluidic\nstate in their macroscopic scale, according to the consistency between macro\nand micro worlds. However, many substances just cannot remain their original\natomic fluidic behavior due to breaking of the consistency between macro and\nmicro states. Based on the current softening theory, it is now easy to\nunderstand that the breaking of such consistency is just caused due to\ngenerated forces from the atomic interactions. To resolve such intrinsic\nconfinement, a group of potential technical approaches can be developed to tune\nthe atomic borders of the matter and thus make desired soft materials. This\nwork provides a theoretical foundation to partially address the nature of the\nmaterial which will aid to make future soft matters in the coming time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 10:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

In this work, we analyze the spatial\nadoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and\nuncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks.\nDuring its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million\nfriendship ties of 3 million users.

If robots\ncan observe not only their own lights but also other robots' lights, their\nlights are called full-light.

When considering L-algorithms, Rendezvous can be solved by\nrobots with full-lights and 3 colors in general asynchronous settings (called\nASYNC) and the number of colors is optimal under these assumptions.

We show that vacuum energy density depends on the choice of time, and in\nalmost all time gauges, is a non-linear function of the cosmological constant.\nThis non-linear relation is a calculation for the vacuum energy density given\nsome arbitrary value of the cosmological constant. Hence, in this\nnon-perturbative framework, the cosmological constant problem does not arise.\nWe also discuss why the conventional cosmological constant problem is not\nwell-posed, and formulate and answer the question: \"Does vacuum gravitate?\"\nFinally, we give a derivation of reduction to quantum mechanics on a flat\nbackground from a non-perturbative gravity-matter theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 13:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

The results may be viewed as a\ngeneralization of geometric quantization, including the non-unitary case.\n  Care has been taken to work with the weakest meaningful topology and to\nassume as little as possible about the spaces and groups involved.

This implies that the setting can be\nsuccessfully applied to quantum field theory, where the groups involved satisfy\nnone of these properties.\n  The paper characterizes linear operators acting on the quantum space of a\ncoherent space in terms of their coherent matrix elements. Coherent maps and\nassociated symmetry groups for coherent spaces are introduced, and formulas are\nderived for the quantization of coherent maps.\n  The importance of coherent maps for quantum mechanics is due to the fact that\nthere is a quantization operator that associates homomorphically with every\ncoherent map a linear operator from the quantum space into itself. This\noperator generalizes to general symmetry groups of coherent spaces the second\nquantization procedure for free classical fields.

To complicate this scenario\nthe complexity of organizing and managing a large collection of data,\nstructured according to a single, unified schema, makes so that there is almost\nnever a single place where to look to satisfy an information need.\n  The Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) paradigm aims at mitigating this\nphenomenon by providing to the users of the system a unified and shared\nconceptual view of the domain of interest (ontology), while still enabling the\ndata to be stored in different data sources, which are managed by a relational\ndatabase.

We first show how support for R2RML mappings has been\nintegrated in Mastro, which was the last feature missing in order to enable the\nsystem to use specifications based solely on W3C recommendations relevant to\nOBDA.

Employing generic models for molecular\njunctions with dissociative nuclear potentials, we analyze the underlying\nmechanisms.

In this work, we introduce HBFP, a hybrid\nBFP-FP approach, which performs all dot products in BFP and other operations in\nfloating point. HBFP delivers the best of both worlds: the high accuracy of\nfloating point at the superior hardware density of fixed point.

In\naddition, connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is the key to avoid\nsegmentation at character level, greatly facilitating the labeling task. One of\nthe main drawbacks of the CNNLSTM-CTC (CLC) solutions is that they need a\nconsiderable part of the text to be transcribed for every type of calligraphy,\ntypically in the order of a few thousands of lines. Furthermore, in some\nscenarios the text to transcribe is not that long, e.g. in the Washington\ndatabase. The CLC typically overfits for this reduced number of training\nsamples. Our proposal is based on the transfer learning (TL) from the\nparameters learned with a bigger database. We first investigate, for a reduced\nand fixed number of training samples, 350 lines, how the learning from a large\ndatabase, the IAM, can be transferred to the learning of the CLC of a reduced\ndatabase, Washington.

The intended application of this new problem model,\nwhich will be conducted in a follow-up paper, is to practical phase retrieval\nproblems where the aberration phase is sparse with respect to the orthogonal\nbasis of Zernike polynomials. Such a problem is called sparse phase retrieval\n(SPR) problem in this paper. When the amplitude modulation at the exit pupil is\nuniform, a new scheme of sparsity regularization on phase is proposed to\ncapture the sparsity property of the SPR problem. Based on this regularization\nscheme, we design and analyze an efficient solution method, named SROP\nalgorithm, for solving SPR given only a single intensity point-spread-function\nimage. The algorithm is a combination of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm with\nthe newly proposed sparsity regularization on the phase. The latter\nregularization step is mathematically a rotation but with direction varying in\niterations. Surprisingly, this rotation is shown to be a metric projection on\nan auxiliary set which is independent of iterations. As a consequence, SROP\nalgorithm is proved to be the cyclic projections algorithm for solving a\nfeasibility problem involving three auxiliary sets. Analyzing regularity\nproperties of the latter auxiliary sets, we obtain convergence results for SROP\nalgorithm based on recent convergence theory for the cyclic projections\nalgorithm.

In addition, machine-learned click models trained to predict which ad\nwill bring the highest revenue may overestimate an ad click-through rate, and\nas a consequence negatively impacting revenue for both the ad network and the\npublisher.

We then estimate dwell time thresholds\nof accidental clicks from that component.
