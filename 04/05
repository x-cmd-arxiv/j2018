This\ndatabase contains 362 MS, based on observations at the 30.4 nm of the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO). Three of the five investigated physical properties of MS show a clear\nlong-term temporal variation after smoothing the raw data.

The results reveal a strong pattern of periodicities at around\n2-year (also referred to as Quasi-Biennial Oscillations -- QBOs).

For\nmost of the time span investigated, the oscillations are out-of-phase.

We study the effects of such\nvariations on the luminosity distance and on the peak luminosity of Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia). For this, we consider the change of each fundamental\nconstant separately and discuss a dipole model for its variation. Elaborating\nupon our previous work, we take into account the variation of the peak\nluminosity of Type Ia supernovae resulting from the variation of each of these\nfundamental constants. Furthermore, we also include the change of the energy\nrelease during the explosion, which was not studied before in the literature.\nWe perform a statistical analysis to compare the predictions of the dipole\nmodel for {\\alpha} and c variation with the Union2.1 and JLA compilations of\nSNe Ia. For this, we also allow the nuisance parameters of the distance\nestimator $\\mu_0$ and the cosmological density matter $\\Omega_m$ to vary. As a\nresult of our analysis we obtain a first estimate of the possible spatial\nvariation of the speed of light c. On the other hand, we find that there is no\nsignificant difference between the several phenomenological models studied here\nand the standard cosmological model, in which fundamental constants do not vary\nat all. Thus, we conclude that the actual set of data of Type Ia supernovae\ndoes not allow to verify the hypothetical spatial variation of fundamental\nconstants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 17:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

For planets, it is in contrast still a\nyoung method which only became important in recent years because of the rapid\nincrease of the number of known extrasolar planets, and the associated growth\nof statistical observational constraints. With planetary population synthesis,\nthe theory of planet formation and evolution can be put to the test against\nthese constraints. In this review of planetary population synthesis, we first\nbriefly list key observational constraints. Then, the work flow in the method\nand its two main components are presented, namely global end-to-end models that\npredict planetary system properties directly from protoplanetary disk\nproperties and probability distributions for these initial conditions. An\noverview of various population synthesis models in the literature is given. The\nsub-models for the physical processes considered in global models are\ndescribed: the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, the planets' accretion of\nsolids and gas, orbital migration, and N-body interactions among concurrently\ngrowing protoplanets. Next, typical population synthesis results are\nillustrated in the form of new syntheses obtained with the latest generation of\nthe Bern model. Planetary formation tracks, the distribution of planets in the\nmass-distance and radius-distance plane, the planetary mass function, and the\ndistributions of planetary radii, semimajor axes, and luminosities are shown,\nlinked to underlying physical processes, and compared with their observational\ncounterparts. We finish by highlighting the most important predictions made by\npopulation synthesis models and discuss the lessons learned from these\npredictions - both those later observationally confirmed and those rejected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

In America forecasting\ntools are widely used by judiciary systems for making decisions about risk\noffenders based on criminal justice for risk offenders. By making use of such\ntools, the judiciary relies on ADM in order to make error free judgement on\noffenders. For this purpose, one of the quality measures for machine learning\ntechniques which is widly used, the $AUC$ (area under curve), is compared to\nand contrasted for results with the $PPV_k$ (positive predictive value).\nKeeping in view the criticality of judgement along with a high dependency on\ntools offering ADM, it is necessary to evaluate risk tools that aid in decision\nmaking based on algorithms. In this methodology, such an evaluation is\nconducted by implementing a common machine learning approach called binary\nclassifier, as it determines the binary outcome of the underlying juristic\nquestion. This thesis showed that the $PPV_k$ (positive predictive value)\ntechnique models the decision of judges much better than the $AUC$. Therefore,\nthis research has investigated whether there exists a classifier for which the\n$PPV_k$ deviates from $AUC$ by a large proportion. It could be shown that the\ndeviation can rise up to 0.75. In order to test this deviation on an already in\nused Classifier, data from the fourth generation risk assement tool COMPAS was\nused. The result were were quite alarming as the two measures derivate from\neach other by 0.48. In this study, the risk assessment evaluation of the\nforecasting tools was successfully conducted, carefully reviewed and examined.\nAdditionally, it is also discussed whether such systems used for the purpose of\nmaking decisions should be socially accepted or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 18:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}

With\nfurther computation, methods exist to reason about richer models with inputs,\nnonlinear differential equations, and hybrid dynamics. As such, the scalability\nof affine systems verification is a prerequisite to scalable analysis for more\ncomplex systems. In this paper, we improve the scalability of affine systems\nverification, in terms of the number of dimensions (variables) in the system.\n  The reachable states of affine systems can be written in terms of the matrix\nexponential, and safety checking can be performed at specific time steps with\nlinear programming. Unfortunately, for large systems with many state variables,\nthis direct approach requires an intractable amount of memory while using an\nintractable amount of computation time. We overcome these challenges by\ncombining several methods that leverage common problem structure. Memory is\nreduced by exploiting initial states that are not full-dimensional and safety\nproperties (outputs) over a few linear projections of the state variables.\nComputation time is saved by using numerical simulations to compute only\nprojections of the matrix exponential relevant for the verification problem.\nSince large systems often have sparse dynamics, we use Krylov-subspace\nsimulation approaches based on the Arnoldi or Lanczos iterations.

In thin magnetic films with easy-plane\nmagnetic anisotropy, magnon attraction is typically achieved for an in-plane\nmagnetization. At sufficient stimulus, e.g. via application of spin transfer\ntorque, the attraction can give rise to self-localized magnetic solitons, such\nas spin wave bullets, which shrink as their amplitude increases. In contrast,\nfor an oblique magnetization above a certain critical angle, the repulsion of\nmagnons only allows for propagating modes, which expand when pumped more\nstrongly. Here we demonstrate, both analytically and using micromagnetic\nsimulations, that such a dichotomic description is inadequate for magnonic edge\nmodes, which naturally appear in confined magnetic systems.

In a\nprevious paper, dislocation drag from phonon wind as a function of velocity was\ncomputed from first principles in the isotropic limit, in part for simplicity,\nbut also arguing that macroscopically, a polycrystalline metal looks isotropic.\nHowever, since the single crystal grains are typically a few microns up to a\nmillimeter in size, dislocations travel in single crystals and cross\nboundaries, but never actually see an isotropic material.

The task is to fuse multiple images obtained by exposure bracketing to\ncreate an image which comprises a high level of details. Typically, such images\nare not possible to obtain directly from a camera due to hardware limitations,\ne.g., a limited dynamic range of the sensor. A major problem of such tasks is\nthat the images may not be spatially aligned due to scene motion or camera\nmotion. It is known that the required alignment by image registration problems\nis ill-posed. In this case, the images to be aligned vary in their intensity\nrange, which makes the problem even more difficult.\n  To address the mentioned problems, we propose an end-to-end\n\\emph{Convolutional Neural Network} (CNN) based approach to learn to estimate\nexposure fusion from $2$ and $3$ Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images depicting\ndifferent scene contents. To the best of our knowledge, no efficient and robust\nCNN-based end-to-end approach can be found in the literature for this kind of\nproblem. The idea is to create a dataset with perfectly aligned LDR images to\nobtain ground-truth exposure fusion images. At the same time, we obtain\nadditional LDR images with some motion, having the same exposure fusion\nground-truth as the perfectly aligned LDR images. This way, we can train an\nend-to-end CNN having misaligned LDR input images, but with a proper ground\ntruth exposure fusion image. We propose a specific CNN-architecture to solve\nthis problem.

In\nthis paper, we show that for any iterative algorithm at any iteration, the\noverall performance is lower bounded by the minimax statistical error over an\nappropriately chosen loss function class. This implies an important trade-off\nbetween convergence and stability of the algorithm -- a faster converging\nalgorithm has to be less stable, and vice versa. As a direct consequence of\nthis fundamental tradeoff, new convergence lower bounds can be derived for\nclasses of algorithms constrained with different stability bounds.

Agentless periodic filesystem monitors are optimal\nsolutions to protect cloud virtual machines because of the secure and\nlow-overhead features. However, most of the periodic monitors usually scan all\nof the virtual machine filesystem or protected files in every scanning poll, so\nlots of secure files are scanned again and again even though they are not\ncorrupted.

Our core idea is to minimize\nthe scope of the scanning files in both file integrity checking and virus\ndetection. In our monitor, if a file is considered secure, it will not be\nscanned when it has not been modified.

This so-called \"neutrino floor\" may\nsignificantly reduce the sensitivity of an experiment to DM-nuclei\ninteractions, particularly if the recoil spectrum of the neutrino background is\napproximately degenerate with the DM signal. This occurs for the conventionally\nconsidered spin-independent (SI) or spin-dependent (SD) interactions. In such\ncase, an increase in the experiment's exposure by multiple orders of magnitude\nmay not yield any significant increase in sensitivity. The typically considered\nSI and SD interactions, however, do not adequately reflect the whole landscape\nof the well-motivated DM models, which includes other interactions. Since\nparticle DM has not been detected yet in laboratories, it is essential to\nunderstand and maximize the detection capabilities for a broad variety of\npossible models and signatures. In this work we explore the impact of the\nbackground arising from various neutrino sources on the discovery potential of\na DM signal for a large class of viable DM-nucleus interactions and several\npotential futuristic experimental settings, with different target elements. For\nsome momentum suppressed cross sections, large DM particle masses and heavier\ntargets, we find that there is no suppression of the discovery limits due to\nneutrino backgrounds.

The conceptual systems\nphysicists use to think about nature are made from many different resources,\nformal and not, working together and inextricably linked.

In contrast, in physics class, novice students often treat\nmathematics as only a calculational tool, isolating it from their rich\nknowledge of the physical world. We are interested in cases where students\nbreak that pattern by reading, manipulating, and building equations\nmeaningfully rather than purely formally. To find examples of this and explore\nthe diversity of ways students combine formal and intuitive resources, we\nconducted problem-solving interviews with students in an introductory physics\nfor life sciences class. During the interviews, we scaffolded student use of\nstrategies which call for both formal and intuitive reasoning, such as \"examine\nthe extreme cases\". We use the analytic framework of epistemic games to model\nhow students used the strategies and how they accessed problem-solving\nresources, and we present evidence that novice students using these strategies\naccessed more expert-like conceptual systems than those typically described in\nproblem-solving literature. They blended physical intuition with mathematical\nsymbolic templates, reconceptualized the nature of equations, and distinguished\nsimilar functional forms. Once introduced to a strategy, students applied it to\nnew scenarios and found new types of uses for it, acknowledging it as a useful,\ngeneral purpose problem-solving technique.

Hence, it has been suggested that biological robustness ultimately\nmust rely on complex gene regulatory networks and clean-up mechanisms. Here we\nexplore developmental processes that have evolved inherent robustness against\nstochasticity. In the context of the Drosophila eye disc, multiple optical\nunits, ommatidia, develop into crystal-like patterns. During the larva-to-pupa\nstage of metamorphosis, the centers of the ommatidia are specified initially\nthrough the diffusion of morphogens, followed by the specification of R8 cells.\nEstablishing the R8 cell is crucial in setting up the geometric, and\nfunctional, relationships of cells within an ommatidium and among neighboring\nommatidia. Here we study a mathematical model of these spatio-temporal\nprocesses in the presence of stochasticity, defining and applying measures that\nquantify order within the resulting spatial patterns. We observe a universal\nsigmoidal response to increasing transcriptional noise. Ordered patterns\npersist up to a threshold noise level in the model parameters. As the noise is\nfurther increased past a threshold point of no return, these ordered patterns\nrapidly become disordered. Such robustness in development allows for the\naccumulation of genetic variation without any observable changes in phenotype.\nWe argue that the observed sigmoidal dependence introduces robustness allowing\nfor sizable amounts of genetic variation and transcriptional noise to be\ntolerated in natural populations without resulting in phenotype variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 07:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

These axions carry\na charge, which, in our model, also plays the r\\^ole of the magnetic charge.\nThe resulting geometry is close to that of a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN) black\nhole with charge proportional to the KR-axion charge.

The resulting energy was finite, and\nproportional to the KR-axion charge; however, the size of the shell was not\ndetermined and left as a phenomenological parameter. In the current article, we\ncan calculate the mass-shell size, on proposing a regularisation of the black\nhole singularity via a matching procedure between the RN metric in the outer\nregion and, in the inner region, a de Sitter space with a (positive)\ncosmological constant proportional to the scale of the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of $SO(3)$ .

The\nidea to prove existence is somewhat close in spirit to [Buffoni-Sere, CPAM 49,\n285-305]. However several differences are required in the argument: facing a\nstrongly indefinite functional, we need to perform a nonlo-cal Lyapunov-Schmidt\nreduction; in order to justify the stability of multiple front standing waves,\nwe rely on a more precise variational characterization of such critical points.\nBased on this approach, both stable and unstable standing waves are\nestablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 08:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 13:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 10:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-20"}

This procedure is able to handle a large\nvariety of cases, from an isolated source to blended multi-component sources\nfrom an heterogeneous dataset (i.e. a range of observation sensitivities and\nspectral/spatial resolutions). Furthermore, MrMoose handles upper-limits during\nthe fitting process in a continuous way allowing models to be gradually less\nprobable as upper limits are approached. The aim is to propose a simple-to-use,\nyet highly-versatile fitting tool fro handling increasing source complexity\nwhen combining multi-wavelength datasets with fully customisable filter/model\ndatabases. The complete control of the user is one advantage, which avoids the\ntraditional problems related to the \"black box\" effect, where parameter or\nmodel tunings are impossible and can lead to overfitting and/or\nover-interpretation of the results. Also, while a basic knowledge of Python and\nstatistics is required, the code aims to be sufficiently user-friendly for\nnon-experts. We demonstrate the procedure on three cases: two\nartificially-generated datasets and a previous result from the literature. In\nparticular, the most complex case (inspired by a real source, combining\nHerschel, ALMA and VLA data) in the context of extragalactic SED fitting, makes\nMrMoose a particularly-attractive SED fitting tool when dealing with partially\nblended sources, without the need for data deconvolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 09:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

In this regard, several studies have\nbeen conducted in the past using sharp interface approaches where the influence\nof elastic energy anisotropy on the precipitate shapes has been investigated.\nIn this paper, we propose a diffuse interface approach which allows us to\nminimize grid-anisotropy related issues applicable in sharp-interface methods.\nIn this context, we introduce a novel phase-field method where we minimize the\nfunctional consisting of the elastic and surface energy contributions while\npreserving the precipitate volume.

This way we\nreproduce universal classical Lax pairs by D'Hoker-Phong and\nBordner-Corrigan-Sasaki, and complement them with quantum Lax pairs in all\ncases (including the elliptic case, where they were not previously known).

One of the main challenges in tracking is to\nadapt to object appearance changes over time and avoiding drifting to\nbackground clutter. We address this challenge by proposing a deep neural\nnetwork composed of different parts, which functions as a society of tracking\nparts. They work in conjunction according to a certain policy and learn from\neach other in a robust manner, using co-occurrence constraints that ensure\nrobust inference and learning. From a structural point of view, our network is\ncomposed of two main pathways. One pathway is more conservative. It carefully\nmonitors a large set of simple tracker parts learned as linear filters over\ndeep feature activation maps. It assigns the parts different roles. It promotes\nthe reliable ones and removes the inconsistent ones. We learn these filters\nsimultaneously in an efficient way, with a single closed-form formulation, for\nwhich we propose novel theoretical properties. The second pathway is more\nprogressive. It is learned completely online and thus it is able to better\nmodel object appearance changes. In order to adapt in a robust manner, it is\nlearned only on highly confident frames, which are decided using co-occurrences\nwith the first pathway. Thus, our system has the full benefit of two main\napproaches in tracking. The larger set of simpler filter parts offers\nrobustness, while the full deep network learned online provides adaptability to\nchange.

We analyze the electronic dynamics by presenting\ndifferential cross sections for both attractive and repulsive scattering\ncenters.

The metric is presented as an expansion in powers of\nr/b << 1, in which r is the distance to the black hole and b the characteristic\nlength scale of the tidal field --- the typical distance to the remote bodies\nresponsible for the tidal environment. The metric is expanded through order\n(r/b)^4 and written in terms of a number of tidal multipole moments, the\ngravitoelectric moments E_{ab}, E_{abc}, E_{abcd} and the gravitomagnetic\nmoments B_{ab}, B_{abc}, B_{abcd}. It differs from the similar construction of\nPoisson and Vlasov in that the tidal perturbation is presented in Regge-Wheeler\ngauge instead of the light-cone gauge employed previously. In the second part\nof the paper we determine the tidal moments by matching the black-hole metric\nto a post-Newtonian metric that describes a system of bodies with weak mutual\ngravity. This extends the previous work of Taylor and Poisson (paper I in this\nsequence), which computed only the leading-order tidal moments, E_{ab} and\nB_{ab}. The matching is greatly facilitated by the Regge-Wheeler form of the\nblack-hole metric, and this motivates the work carried out in the first part of\nthe paper. The tidal moments are calculated accurately through the first\npost-Newtonian approximation, and at this order they are independent of the\nprecise nature of the compact body. The moments therefore apply equally well to\na rotating black hole, or to a (rotating or nonrotating) neutron star. As an\napplication of this formalism, we examine the intrinsic geometry of a tidally\ndeformed event horizon, and describe it in terms of a deformation function that\nrepresents a quadrupolar and octupolar tidal bulge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 13:47:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 12:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

The RV data is modelled\ntogether with the Kepler photometry using a photodynamical model. The inclusion\nof velocity information breaks the $MR^{-3}$ degeneracy inherent in timing data\nalone, allowing us to measure the absolute stellar and planetary radii and\nmasses. With uncertainties of 12% and 13% for the stellar and inner planet\nradii, and 35%, 24%, and 35% for the masses of the star, planet b, and planet c\nrespectively, these measurements are the most precise to date for a single host\nstar system using this technique. The transiting planet mass is determined at\nbetter precision than the star mass. This shows that modelling the radial\nvelocities and the light curve together in systems of dynamically interacting\nplanets provides a way of characterising both the star and the planets without\nbeing limited by knowledge of the star. On the other hand, the period ratio and\neccentricities place the Kepler-419 system in a sweet spot; had around twice as\nmany transits been observed, the mass of the transiting planet could have been\nmeasured using its own TTVs. Finally, the origin of the Kepler-419 system is\ndiscussed. We show that the system is near a coplanar high-eccentricity secular\nfixed point, related to the alignment of the orbits, which has prevented the\ninner orbit from circularising. For most other relative apsidal orientations,\nplanet b's orbit would be circular with a semi-major axis of 0.03 au. This\nsuggests a mechanism for forming hot Jupiters in multiplanetary systems without\nthe need of high mutual inclinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 14:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Many metric learning algorithms learn a global\ndistance function from data that satisfy the constraints of the problem.\nHowever, in many real-world datasets that the discrimination power of features\nvaries in the different regions of input space, a global metric is often unable\nto capture the complexity of the task. To address this challenge, local metric\nlearning methods are proposed that learn multiple metrics across the different\nregions of input space. Some advantages of these methods are high flexibility\nand the ability to learn a nonlinear mapping but typically achieves at the\nexpense of higher time requirement and overfitting problem. To overcome these\nchallenges, this research presents an online multiple metric learning\nframework. Each metric in the proposed framework is composed of a global and a\nlocal component learned simultaneously. Adding a global component to a local\nmetric efficiently reduce the problem of overfitting. The proposed framework is\nalso scalable with both sample size and the dimension of input data. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first local online similarity/distance\nlearning framework based on PA (Passive/Aggressive). In addition, for\nscalability with the dimension of input data, DRP (Dual Random Projection) is\nextended for local online learning in the present work. It enables our methods\nto be run efficiently on high-dimensional datasets, while maintains their\npredictive performance. The proposed framework provides a straightforward local\nextension to any global online similarity/distance learning algorithm based on\nPA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 15:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Recent accurate\nmeasurements of position, velocity, and metallicity provided by Tycho Gaia\nAstrometric Solution (TGAS) and RAdial Velocity Experiments (RAVE) have\nrevealed that the Hercules stream is most clearly seen in the metal-rich region\n([Fe/H] > 0), while it is not clearly seen in lower metallicity region ([Fe/H]\n< -0.25). By using a large number of chemo-dynamical 2D test-particle\nsimulations with a rotating bar and/or spiral arms, we find that the observed\n[Fe/H] dependence of the Hercules stream is a natural consequence of the\ninside-out formation of the stellar disc and the existence of highly non-closed\norbits in the rotating frame of the bar or spiral arms. Our successful models\nthat reproduce the observed properties of the Hercules stream include not only\nfast-bar-only and fast-bar+spiral models, but also slow-bar+spiral models. This\nindicates that it is very difficult to estimate the pattern speed of the bar or\nspiral arms based only on the observations of the Hercules stream in the Solar\nneighbourhood. As a by-product of our simulations, we make some predictions\nabout the locations across the Galactic plane where we can observe velocity\nbimodality that is not associated with the Hercules stream.

While our framework is general for infinite\ndimensional manifolds, we specifically treat the case of diffeomorphisms,\nmotivated by optical flow problems in computer vision. This is accomplished by\nbuilding on a recent variational approach to a general class of accelerated\noptimization methods by Wibisono, Wilson and Jordan, which applies in finite\ndimensions. We generalize that approach to infinite dimensional manifolds. We\nderive the surprisingly simple continuum evolution equations, which are partial\ndifferential equations, for accelerated gradient descent, and relate it to\nsimple mechanical principles from fluid mechanics. Our approach has natural\nconnections to the optimal mass transport problem. This is because one can\nthink of our approach as an evolution of an infinite number of particles\nendowed with mass (represented with a mass density) that moves in an energy\nlandscape. The mass evolves with the optimization variable, and endows the\nparticles with dynamics. This is different than the finite dimensional case\nwhere only a single particle moves and hence the dynamics does not depend on\nthe mass.

The delay between stimulus and\nreaction thus depends on the interaction of these tasks and is subject to\ntiming constraints. Such constraints exist for a number of reasons and range\nfrom possible impacts on customer experiences to safety requirements. We\npresent a technique to determine end-to-end latencies of such task sequences.\nThe technique is demonstrated on the example of electronic control units (ECUs)\nin automotive embedded real-time systems. Our approach is able to deal with\nmulti-core architectures and supports four different activation patterns,\nincluding interrupts. It is the first formal analysis approach making use of\nload assumptions in order to exclude infeasible data propagation paths without\nthe knowledge of worst-case execution times or worst-case response times. We\nemploy a constraint programming solver to compute bounds on end-to-end\nlatencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 16:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

Many countries\nhave constructed monitoring stations to hourly collect pollution values.\nRecently, there is a research in Daegu city, Korea for real-time air quality\nmonitoring via sensors installed on taxis running across the whole city. The\ncollected data is huge (1-second interval) and in both Spatial and Temporal\nformat. In this paper, based on this spatiotemporal Big data, we propose a\nreal-time air pollution prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) algorithm for image-like Spatial distribution of air pollution. Regarding\nto Temporal information in the data, we introduce a combination of a Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) unit for time series data and a Neural Network model\nfor other air pollution impact factors such as weather conditions to build a\nhybrid prediction model. This model is simple in architecture but still brings\ngood prediction ability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 06:36:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 00:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 02:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

In this case $M(r)$ become geometrical\ndegrees of freedom while $\\psi(r)$ is matter degrees of freedom of the apparent\nhorizon. However our solution is obtained versus the quantum harmonic\noscillator which defined against the well known hermit polynomials. In the\nlatter case we obtain quantized mass of the SdS quantum black hole as\n$\\sqrt{\\Lambda}M(n)=\\big(\\frac{2n+1}{12\\sqrt{2}}\\big)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ in which\n$\\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant and $n=0,1,2,\\cdots $ are quantum\nnumbers of the hermit polynomials. This shows that a quantized SdS in its\nground state has a nonzero value for the mass $M(0)=0.38914/\\sqrt{\\Lambda}$.\nThus one can infer that the latter result satisfies Penrose hypotheses for\ncosmic censorship where a causal singularity may be covered by a horizon\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 03:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}
