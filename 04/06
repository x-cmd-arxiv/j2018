Most likely due to instrumental limitations and their natural\nfaintness, little is known about debris disks around low-mass stars, especially\nwhen it comes to spatially resolved observations. We present new VLT/SPHERE\nIRDIS Dual-Polarization Imaging (DPI) observations in which we detect the dust\nring around the M2 spectral type star TWA\\,7. Combined with additional Angular\nDifferential Imaging observations we aim at a fine characterization of the\ndebris disk and setting constraints on the presence of low-mass planets. We\nmodel the SPHERE DPI observations and constrain the location of the small dust\ngrains, as well as the spectral energy distribution of the debris disk, using\nthe results inferred from the observations, and perform simple N-body\nsimulations. We find that the dust density distribution peaks at 25 au, with a\nvery shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination of 13\ndegrees with a position angle of 90 degrees East of North. We also report low\nsignal-to-noise detections of an outer belt at a distance of ~52 au from the\nstar, of a spiral arm in the Southern side of the star, and of a possible dusty\nclump at 3.9 au. These findings seem to persist over timescales of at least a\nyear. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close\nvicinity of the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper\nlimits. We find that the SED is best reproduced with an inner disk at 7 au and\nanother belt at 25 au. We report the detections of several unexpected features\nin the disk around TWA\\,7. A yet undetected 100 M$_\\oplus$ planet with a\nsemi-major axis at 20-30 au could possibly explain the outer belt as well as\nthe spiral arm.

In this paper, we investigate the\nhypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead\nemission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model\ncombined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion\nrates ($\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large\ndust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from\nhot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO\nemission with respect to the continuum. On the other hand, low accretion rates\n($\\lesssim10^{-6}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in smaller dust\nsublimation radii, a correspondingly smaller emitting area of CO, and thus also\nlower CO emission with respect to the continuum. In general, moderate accretion\nrates produce the most prominent, and therefore detectable, CO first overtone\nemission. We compare our findings to a recent near-infrared spectroscopic\nsurvey of MYSOs, finding results consistent with our hypothesis. We conclude\nthat the detection rate of CO bandhead emission in the spectra of MYSOs could\nbe the result of MYSOs exhibiting a range of mass accretion rates, perhaps due\nto the variable accretion suggested by recent multi-epoch observations of these\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 16:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Typically, scaling out entails\nassigning a different partition of the application state to each server. But\ndata partitioning is at odds with preserving the strong consistency guarantees\nof ACID transactions, a fundamental building block of many OLTP applications.\nThe more we scale out and spread data across multiple servers, the more\nfrequent distributed transactions accessing data at different servers will be.\nWith a large number of servers, the high cost of distributed transactions makes\nscaling out ineffective or even detrimental.\n  In this paper we propose Operation Partitioning, a novel paradigm to scale\nout OLTP applications that require ACID guarantees. Operation Partitioning\nindirectly partitions data across servers by partitioning the application's\noperations through static analysis. This partitioning of operations yields to a\nlock-free Conveyor Belt protocol for distributed coordination, which can scale\nout unmodified applications running on top of unmodified database management\nsystems. We implement the protocol in a system called Elia and use it to scale\nout two applications, TPC-W and RUBiS.

In quantum theory, this\nconstruction accommodates the notion of subsystems as factors of a tensor\nproduct Hilbert space, as well as the notion of subsystems associated to a\nsubalgebra of operators. Classical systems can be interpreted as subsystems of\nquantum systems in different ways, by applying our construction to agents who\nhave access to different sets of operations, including multiphase covariant\nchannels and certain sets of free operations arising in the resource theory of\nquantum coherence. After illustrating the basic definitions, we restrict our\nattention to closed systems, that is, systems where all physical\ntransformations act invertibly and where all states can be generated from a\nfixed initial state. For closed systems, we propose a dynamical definition of\npure states, and show that all the states of all subsystems admit a canonical\npurification.

Recently, scientists have\nhad to retract publications due to errors caused by software faults. Systematic\ntesting can identify such faults in code.\n  Objective: This study aims to identify specific challenges, proposed\nsolutions, and unsolved problems faced when testing scientific software.\n  Method: We conducted a systematic literature survey to identify and analyze\nrelevant literature. We identified 62 studies that provided relevant\ninformation about testing scientific software.\n  Results: We found that challenges faced when testing scientific software fall\ninto two main categories: (1) testing challenges that occur due to\ncharacteristics of scientific software such as oracle problems and (2) testing\nchallenges that occur due to cultural differences between scientists and the\nsoftware engineering community such as viewing the code and the model that it\nimplements as inseparable entities. In addition, we identified methods to\npotentially overcome these challenges and their limitations. Finally we\ndescribe unsolved challenges and how software engineering researchers and\npractitioners can help to overcome them.\n  Conclusions: Scientific software presents special challenges for testing.\nSpecifically, cultural differences between scientist developers and software\nengineers, along with the characteristics of the scientific software make\ntesting more difficult. Existing techniques such as code clone detection can\nhelp to improve the testing process. Software engineers should consider special\nchallenges posed by scientific software such as oracle problems when developing\ntesting techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 17:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}

Two of the most popular approaches for\ncommunity detection are to maximize an objective function called \"modularity\"\nand to perform statistical inference using stochastic block models.\nGeneralizing work by Newman on monolayer networks (Physical Review E 94,\n052315), we show in multilayer networks that maximizing modularity is\nequivalent, under certain conditions, to maximizing the posterior probability\nof community assignments under a suitably chosen stochastic block model.

This gives internal structure to each vortex and changes the nature of\ninter-vortex interactions, especially at short range. This can have significant\nconsequences for vortex lattices wherein vortices are in close proximity to one\nanother. We consider the attractive Hubbard model, a prototypical model for\nphase competition, with checkerboard charge density wave order appearing in\nvortex cores.

Using Bogoliubov deGennes mean field\nsimulations, we study the variation in quasiparticle gap, superfluid stiffness\nand shear stiffness, as the core order is tuned.

Furthermore, we investigate\nthe connection between a community's origin and its future growth. Our results\nshow that strong parent connections are associated with future community\ngrowth, confirming the importance of existing community structures in which a\nnew community emerges.

We\npresent new higher resolution RIXS data at the Re-L$_3$ edge in Ba$_2$YReO$_6$\nwhich finds a previously unresolved peak splitting, providing further\nconfirmation of our theoretical predictions. Using ab initio electronic\nstructure calculations on Ba$_2$${\\cal M}$ReO$_6$ (with ${\\cal M}$=Re, Os, Ir)\nwe show that while the atomic limit yields a reasonable effective Hamiltonian\ndescription of the experimental observations, effects such as $t_{2g}$-$e_g$\ninteractions and hybridization with oxygen are important.

The presented method is termed as Fine-grained and Progressive\nAttention Localization Network (FPAN), which uses an image and a queried object\nas input to accurately locate the target object in the image.

This article proposes a novel framework for\nlightweight and privacy-preserving truth discovery called LPTD-I, which is\nimplemented by incorporating fog and cloud platforms, and adopting the\nhomomorphic Paillier encryption and one-way hash chain techniques. This scheme\nnot only protects devices' privacy, but also achieves high efficiency.\nMoreover, we introduce a fault tolerant (LPTD-II) framework which can\neffectively overcome malfunctioning CIoT devices. Detailed security analysis\nindicates the proposed schemes are secure under a comprehensively designed\nthreat model. Experimental simulations are also carried out to demonstrate the\nefficiency of the proposed schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 21:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-09"}

Clear observational proof of the general influence\nof magnetic fields on the early phase of cloud collapse is still pending. First\nresults on Bok globules with simple structures indicate dominant magnetic\nfields across large spatial scales (Bertrang+2014).\n  The aim of this study is to test the magnetic field influence across Bok\nglobules with more complex density structures. We apply near-infrared\npolarimetry to trace the magnetic field structure on scales of 10^4-10^5au in\nselected Bok globules. The combination of these measurements with archival data\nin the optical and sub-mm wavelength range allows us to characterize the\nmagnetic field on scales of 10^3-10^6au.\n  We present polarimetric data in the near-infrared wavelength range for the\nthree Bok globules CB34, CB56, and [OMK2002]18, combined with archival\npolarimetric data in the optical wavelength range for CB34 and CB56, and in the\nsub-millimeter wavelength range for CB34 and [OMK2002]18.

We find\nthat the optimal gauge choice is given by a parallel transport formulation.\nThis parallel transport dynamics can be simply interpreted as the dynamics\ndriven by the residual vectors, analogous to those defined in eigenvalue\nproblems in the time-independent setup.

Considerable progress has been made\nrecently in data-driven predictions, and in linking popularity to external\npromotions.

We show RNN-MAS not only to outperform the\ncurrent state-of-the-art Youtube popularity prediction system by 17%, but also\nto capture complex dynamics, such as seasonal trends of unseen influence.

The joint probability\ndistribution for the possible spin outcomes for two particles with coupled\nspins is examined. Contrasting conclusions are made: (i) Under the frequentist\ninterpretation, the QM spin distribution implies a widely-discussed\nnon-locality because probabilistic conditioning on a spin measurement is viewed\nas corresponding to a causal influence. Under the Bayesian interpretation, this\nconditioning is viewed as providing information relevant to the spin\nprobabilities and the argument for non-locality loses its force. (ii) The\nfrequentist interpretation leads to the locality condition used by John Bell in\n1964 to establish conditions for the existence of hidden variables behind the\nspin probability distribution but this condition is not consistent with the\nproduct (Bayes) rule of probability theory. Under the Bayesian interpretation,\nthere is no motivation for this locality condition and a new stochastic\nhidden-variable model is given that reproduces the spin distribution. (iii)\nBell's original 1964 inequality provides a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a third-order joint probability distribution for three spin\nvariables that is compatible through marginalization with the second-order\njoint distributions for the three possible spin pairs. Bell's inequality is\nlogically equivalent to the 1969 CHSH inequality that involves expectations of\nfour pairs of four spin variables; the CHSH inequality must be satisfied in\norder for a fourth-order joint probability distribution for the four spin\nvariables to exist. When any of these inequalities are violated, a joint\nprobability distribution for three spin outcomes fails to be valid because some\nprobabilities are negative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 01:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-09"}

Identifying a\njet break from a GRB afterglow lightcurve allows a measurement of the jet\nopening angle and true energetics of GRBs. In this paper, we reinvestigate this\nproblem using a large sample of GRBs that have an optical jet break which is\nconsistent with being achromatic in the X-ray band. Our sample includes 99 GRBs\nfrom February 1997 to March 2015 that have optical and, for Swift GRBs, X-ray\nlightcurves that are consistent with the jet break interpretation. Out of 99\nGRBs we have studied, 55 GRBs are found to have temporal and spectral behaviors\nboth before and after the break consistent with the theoretical predictions of\nthe jet break models, respectively. These include 53 long/soft (Type II) and 2\nshort/hard (Type I) GRBs. Only 1 GRB is classified as the candidate of a jet\nbreak with energy injection. Another 41 and 3 GRBs are classified as the\ncandidates with the lower and upper limits of the jet break time, respectively.\nThe typical beaming correction factor $f_b^{-1} \\sim 1000$ for Type II GRBs,\nsuggesting an even higher total GRB event rate density in the universe. Both\nisotropic and jet-corrected energies have a wide span in their distributions.\nWe also investigate several empirical correlations (Amati, Frail, Ghirlanda and\nLiang-Zhang) previously discussed in the literature. We find that in general\nmost of these relations are less tight than before. The existence of early jet\nbreaks and hence small opening angle jets, which were detected in the {\\em\nSwfit era}, is most likely the source of scatter. If one limits the sample to\njet breaks later than $10^4$ s, the Liang-Zhang relation remains tight and the\nGhirlanda relation still exists. These relations are derived from Type II GRBs,\nand Type I GRBs usually deviate from them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 02:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

A\nmajor problem is that there are many materials having residual entropy.\nAmorphous materials and random alloy systems are well-known examples. A\nconventional view is that amorphous materials are not in thermodynamic\nequilibrium and must be exempted from the law. The recent development of\nmaterial sciences has let to a variety of new materials. Some of them have\nambiguous structures which do not fit the qualitative description of\nmetastability. The definition of order states also becomes vague. The\nestablishment of an unambiguous statement which does not depend on the material\nproperties is required. This paper provides a quantitative expression for the\nthird law to meet this requirement. The idea is to introduce the notion of\nclass. Every system belongs to a class. Different classes are thermodynamically\nseparated by special internal constraints which are quantified by the frozen\ncoordinate, r. A frozen coordinate is a state variable that is not commonly\npossessed between two classes. The third law is restated as all materials\nwithin a given class have a common origin of entropy. For two systems belonging\nto different classes, the entropy origins are shifted by the difference in\nentropy associated with the difference r between the two systems. When the\ninternal constraint is removed, the entropy origin must be reconstructed in\norder to establish only one thermodynamic equilibrium. This process is\nirreversible and this irreversibility is observed as the residual entropy. On\nthe basis of this refinement, the residual entropies of amorphous materials as\nwell as the long-standing problem of mixed states can be treated on an equal\nfooting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 03:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:31:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 06:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-24"}

The Z4 orbifold\nquantum Hall states occur at filling factors \\nu = 2/(2m-p) for odd integers\n$m$ and $p$, and have a topological order with a neutral sector characterized\nby the orbifold conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$ at radius\n$R=\\sqrt{p/2}$. When $p=1$ the state is Abelian. The state with $p=3$ is the\n$Z_4$ Read Rezayi state, and the series of $p\\ge 3$ defines a sequence of\nnon-Abelian states that resembles the Laughlin sequence. Our model is based on\nclustering of electrons in groups of four, and is formulated as a two fluid\nmodel in which each wire exhibits two phases: a weak clustered phase, where\ncharge $e$ electrons coexist with charge $4e$ bosons and a strong clustered\nphase where the electrons are strongly bound in groups of 4. The transition\nbetween these two phases on a wire is mapped to the critical point of the 4\nstate clock model, which in turn is described by the orbifold conformal field\ntheory. For an array of wires coupled in the presence of a perpendicular\nmagnetic field, strongly clustered wires form a charge $4e$ bosonic Laughlin\nstate with a chiral charge mode at the edge, but no neutral mode and a gap for\nsingle electrons. Coupled wires near the critical state form quantum Hall\nstates with a gapless neutral mode described by the orbifold theory. The\ncoupled wire approach allows us to employ the Abelian bosonization technique to\nfully analyze the physics of single wire, and then to extract most topological\nproperties of the resulting non-Abelian quantum Hall states. These include the\nlist of quasiparticles, their fusion rules, the correspondence between bulk\nquasiparticles and edge topological sectors, and most of the phases associated\nwith quasiparticles winding one another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 09:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

The\nfrequencies can be offset from the spin frequency of the NS by several Hz, and\ncan drift by 1-3 Hz. One possible explanation is a mode in the bursting ocean,\nthe frequency of which would decrease (in the rotating frame) as the burst\ncools, hence explaining the drifts. Most burst oscillations have been observed\nduring H/He triggered bursts, however there has been one observation of\noscillations during a superburst; hours' long Type I X-ray bursts caused by\nunstable carbon burning deeper in the ocean. This paper calculates the\nfrequency evolution of an oceanic r-mode during a superburst. The rotating\nframe frequency varies during the burst from 4-14 Hz, and is sensitive to the\nbackground parameters, in particular the temperature of the ocean and ignition\ndepth. This calculation is compared to the superburst oscillations observed on\n4U-1636-536. The predicted mode frequencies ($\\sim$ 10 Hz) would require a spin\nfrequency of $\\sim$ 592 Hz to match observations; 6 Hz higher than the spin\ninferred from an oceanic r-mode model for the H/He triggered burst\noscillations.

It can be\napplied to both planar thin-film and nanostructured single-junction solar\ncells.

While the internal quantum luminescence\nefficiency is an intrinsic material property, both latter quantities can be\ndetermined rigorously for an arbitrary solar cell architecture by\nthree-dimensional electrodynamic dipole emission calculations. We demonstrate\nthe strengths and validity of our framework by determining the impact of photon\nrecycling on the $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}$ of a conventional planar organo-metal halide\nperovskite thin-film solar cell and compare it to established reference cases\nwith perfect antireflection and Lambertian light scattering.

The latter is a state-of-the-art\neffective-one-body waveform model that blends together tidal and spin effects.\nWe probe that the combination of the PN-based self-spin terms and of the\nNRTidal description is necessary to obtain minimal mismatches (< 0.01) and\nphase differences (< 1 rad) with respect to the target waveforms.

To this\nend, we first derive an analytical propulsion power consumption model for\nrotary-wing UAVs, and then formulate the energy minimization problem by jointly\noptimizing the UAV trajectory and communication time allocation among GNs, as\nwell as the total mission completion time. The problem is difficult to be\noptimally solved, as it is non-convex and involves infinitely many variables\nover time. To tackle this problem, we first consider the simple\nfly-hover-communicate design, where the UAV successively visits a set of\nhovering locations and communicates with one corresponding GN when hovering at\neach location. For this design, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize\nthe hovering locations and durations, as well as the flying trajectory\nconnecting these hovering locations, by leveraging the travelling salesman\nproblem (TSP) and convex optimization techniques. Next, we consider the general\ncase where the UAV communicates also when flying. We propose a new path\ndiscretization method to transform the original problem into a discretized\nequivalent with a finite number of optimization variables, for which we obtain\na locally optimal solution by applying the successive convex approximation\n(SCA) technique.

Since real ocean waves are non-stationary by\nnature and not defined by a single frequency component, the PTO can be either\ntuned at a constant frequency characterized by the local spectrum, or\ncontinuously tuned to a representative wave frequency. In either case, a\ntime-frequency representation of the waves is expected since the wave profile\nchanges over time. This paper discusses about the PTO tuning problem for\npassive and reactive controllers, in real waves, by comparing different methods\nfor time-varying frequency estimation: the extended Kalman filter (EKF),\nfrequency-locked loop (FLL), and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). The aim is to\nverify the impact of such methods on the absorbed and reactive powers, and the\nPTO rating.

We combine near-infrared data from the VVV survey with mid-infrared\nGLIMPSE data to derive a high-resolution dust extinction map and apply a\nwavelet decomposition technique on it to analyze the fragmentation\ncharacteristics of the cloud, which are compared with predictions from\nfragmentation models. We compare the detected objects to those identified in\n$\\sim$ 10 times coarser resolution from ATLASGAL data. We present a\nhigh-resolution extinction map of Nessie. We estimate the mean line-mass of\nNessie to be $\\sim$ 627 M$_\\odot$/pc and the distance to be $\\sim$ 3.5 kpc. We\nfind that Nessie shows fragmentation at multiple size scales. The\nnearest-neighbour separations of the fragments at all scales are within a\nfactor of 2 of the Jeans' length at that scale. However, the relationship\nbetween the mean densities of the fragments and their separations is\nsignificantly shallower than expected for Jeans' fragmentation. The\nrelationship is similar to the one predicted for a filament that exhibits a\nLarson-like scaling between size-scale and velocity dispersion; such a scaling\nmay result from turbulent support. Based on the number of YSOs in Nessie, we\nestimate that the star formation rate is $\\sim$ 371 M$_\\odot$/Myr; similar\nvalues result if using the number of dense cores, or the amount of dense gas,\nas the proxy of star formation. The star formation efficiency is 0.017. These\nnumbers indicate that Nessie's star-forming content is comparable to the Solar\nneighborhood giant molecular clouds like Orion A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 13:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

Our interest lies in the consequences for\nthe evolution of the early universe and singularity resolution, as well as in\nthe possibility of providing an alternative explanation for dark matter and\ndark energy in the late universe.\n  The thesis is divided into two main parts, dedicated to alternative (and\ncomplementary) ways of tackling the problem of Quantum Gravity. The first part\nis concerned with cosmological applications of background independent\napproaches to Quantum Gravity, both in the context of loop quantisation and in\nquantum geometrodynamics.

Particularly relevant in\nthis respect is local conformal invariance, which finds a natural realisation\nin the framework of Weyl geometry. We build a modified theory of gravity based\non such symmetry principle, and argue that new fields in the extended\ngravitational sector may play the role of dark matter.

As shown in Paper I, a dynamical corotation torque arises due to the\nflow-induced asymmetric distortion of the corotation region and the evolving\nvortensity contrast between the librating horseshoe material and background\ndisc flow. Using simulations of laminar torqued discs containing migrating\nplanets, we demonstrate the existence of the four distinct migration regimes\npredicted in Paper I. In two regimes, the migration is approximately locked to\nthe inward or outward radial gas flow, and in the other regimes the planet\nundergoes outward runaway migration that eventually settles to fast steady\nmigration. In addition, we demonstrate torque and migration reversals induced\nby midplane magnetic stresses, with a bifurcation dependent on the disc surface\ndensity. We develop a model for fast migration, and show why the outward\nrunaway saturates to a steady speed, and examine phenomenologically its\ntermination due to changing local disc conditions. We also develop an\nanalytical model for the corotation torque at late times that includes\nviscosity, for application to discs that sustain modest turbulence.

One method for enabling this tradeoff in the I/O\nsubsystems of computing systems, is to use channel codes that reduce the power\nneeded to send bits on a channel in exchange for bounded errors and erasures on\nnumeric program values---value-deviation-bounded (VDB) codes.

We\nextend prior work to present tighter upper bounds on the efficiency for VDB\ncodes.

The analysis exploits a catalogue that was\ngenerated within the FP7 HELCATS project. Here, we focus on the observational\ncharacteristics of CMEs imaged in the heliosphere by the inner (HI-1) cameras.\nMore specifically, in this paper we present distributions of the basic\nobservational parameters - namely occurrence frequency, central position angle\n(PA) and PA span - derived from nearly 2000 detections of CMEs in the\nheliosphere by HI-1 on STEREO-A or STEREO-B from the minimum between Solar\nCycles 23 and 24 to the maximum of Cycle 24; STEREO-A analysis includes a\nfurther 158 CME detections from the descending phase of Cycle 24, by which time\ncommunication with STEREO-B had been lost. We compare heliospheric CME\ncharacteristics with properties of CMEs observed at coronal altitudes, and with\nsunspot number. As expected, heliospheric CME rates correlate with sunspot\nnumber, and are not inconsistent with coronal rates once instrumental\nfactors/differences in cataloguing philosophy are considered. As well as being\nmore abundant, heliospheric CMEs, like their coronal counterparts, tend to be\nwider during solar maximum. Our results confirm previous coronagraph analyses\nsuggesting that CME launch sites don't simply migrate to higher latitudes with\nincreasing solar activity. At solar minimum, CMEs tend to be launched from\nequatorial latitudes while, at maximum, CMEs appear to be launched over a much\nwider latitude range; this has implications for understanding the CME/solar\nsource association.

With the advent of\nubiquitous GPS-enabled devices (e.g., a smartphone), a cost-effective approach\nfor inferring commuters' mobility mode(s) is to leverage their GPS\ntrajectories. A majority of studies have proposed mode inference models based\non hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning algorithms. However,\nmanual features engender some major drawbacks including vulnerability to\ntraffic and environmental conditions as well as possessing human's bias in\ncreating efficient features. One way to overcome these issues is by utilizing\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) schemes that are capable of automatically\ndriving high-level features from the raw input. Accordingly, in this paper, we\ntake advantage of CNN architectures so as to predict travel modes based on only\nraw GPS trajectories, where the modes are labeled as walk, bike, bus, driving,\nand train. Our key contribution is designing the layout of the CNN's input\nlayer in such a way that not only is adaptable with the CNN schemes but\nrepresents fundamental motion characteristics of a moving object including\nspeed, acceleration, jerk, and bearing rate. Furthermore, we ameliorate the\nquality of GPS logs through several data preprocessing steps. Using the clean\ninput layer, a variety of CNN configurations are evaluated to achieve the best\nCNN architecture. The highest accuracy of 84.8% has been achieved through the\nensemble of the best CNN configuration.

According to the LTE-U forum specification, if an LTE-U base station\n(BS) finds a vacant channel, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn OFF its\ntransmission for only 1 ms, resulting in a maximum duty cycle of 95%. In a\ndense deployment of LTE-U and Wi-Fi, it is very likely that a Wi-Fi access\npoint (AP) will wish to use the same channel. It will start transmission by\ntrying to transmit association packets (using carrier sense multiple access\nwith collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)) through the 1 ms LTE-U OFF duration. Since\nthis duration is very small, it leads to increased association packet drops and\nthus delays the Wi-Fi association process. Once LTE-U, using CSAT, detects\nWi-Fi, it should scale back the duty cycle to 50%. We demonstrate in this\npaper, using an experimental platform as well as theoretical analysis, that if\nLTE-U is using a 95% duty cycle, energy based CSAT will take a much longer time\nto scale back the duty cycle due to the beacon drops and delays in the\nreception. Hence, in order to maintain association fairness with Wi-Fi, we\npropose that a LTE-U BS should not transmit at maximum duty cycles (95%), even\nif the channel is sensed to be vacant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 20:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

Time modulation produces flat dispersion bands at frequencies that\nare multiple integers of half the modulation frequency. These flat bands lead\nto the selective reflection of a broadband incident wave at the interface\nbetween a non-modulated medium, and one with time-modulated stiffness\nproperties. This results from the vanishing group velocity at the flat band\nfrequencies, which prevents their propagation into the modulated domain. Thus,\nthe considered modulated waveguide is understood as a single port system, in\nwhich a broadband incident wave (input) results in a narrowband reflected wave\n(output) at a frequency defined by modulation. The appearance of the flat bands\nfor a time-modulated waveguide is here illustrated analytically and through\nnumerical simulations. The filtering characteristics of a\nnon-modulate/modulated interface are observed experimentally by implementing a\nsquare-wave modulation scheme that employs an array of piezoelectric patches\nbonded to an elastic waveguide subject to transverse motion. The patches are\nshunted through a negative electrical capaticance that, when connected,\nimplements a stiffness reduction for the resulting electromechanical waveguide.\nSwitching the capacitance on and off effectively modulates the stiffness of the\nwaveguide, and illustrates the filtering characteristics associated with\ntime-modulation of the equivalent elastic properties. We envision that a\nsimilar approach could be extended to investigate other properties of\ntime-modulated elastic metamaterials, such as non-reciprocity and one-way\nfiltering of elastic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2018 23:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}
