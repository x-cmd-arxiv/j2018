These intermediate events directly affect\nthe shapes of their longitudinal profiles. Our work is motivated by two studies\nin which such intermediate events have been recorded during follow-up. The\nfirst study concerns Congenital Heart Diseased patients who were followed-up\nechocardiographically, with several patients undergoing reintervention. The\nsecond study concerns patients who participated in the SPRINT study and\nexperienced adverse events during follow-up. We are interested in the change of\nthe longitudinal profiles after the occurrence of the intermediate event and in\nutilizing this information to improve the accuracy of the dynamic prediction\nfor their risk.\n  To achieve this, we propose a flexible joint modeling framework for the\nlongitudinal and survival data that includes the intermediate event as a\ntime-varying binary covariate in both the longitudinal and survival submodels.\nWe consider a set of joint models that postulate different effects of the\nintermediate event in the longitudinal profile and the risk of the clinical\nendpoint, with different formulations for their association while allowing its\nparametrization to change after the occurrence of the intermediate event. Based\non these models we derive dynamic predictions of conditional survival\nprobabilities which are adaptive to different scenarios with respect to the\noccurrence of the intermediate event. We evaluate the accuracy of these\npredictions with a simulation study using the time-dependent area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve and the expected prediction error\nadjusted to our setting. The results suggest that accounting for the changes in\nthe longitudinal profiles and the instantaneous risk for the clinical endpoint\nis important, and improves the accuracy of the dynamic predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 16:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-09"}

However, after almost two\ndecades, observations of this phenomenon are still rare, and most of previous\nreports are plagued by projection effects so that loop contraction could be\neither true implosion or just a change in loop inclination. In this paper, to\ndemonstrate the reality of loop contractions in the global coronal dynamics, we\npresent four events with the continuously contracting loops in an almost\nedge-on geometry from the perspective of SDO/AIA, which are free from the\nambiguity caused by the projection effects, also supplemented by contemporary\nobservations from STEREO for examination. In the wider context of observations,\nsimulations and theories, we argue that the implosion conjecture is valid in\ninterpreting these events. Furthermore, distinct properties of the events allow\nus to identify two physical categories of implosion. One type demonstrates a\nrapid contraction at the beginning of the flare impulsive phase, as magnetic\nfree energy is removed rapidly by a filament eruption. The other type, which\nhas no visible eruption, shows a continuous loop shrinkage during the entire\nflare impulsive phase which we suggest manifests the ongoing conversion of\nmagnetic free energy in a coronal volume. Corresponding scenarios are\ndescribed, which can provide reasonable explanations for the observations. We\nalso point out that implosions may be suppressed in cases when a\nheavily-mass-loaded filament is involved, possibly serving as an alternative\naccount for their observational rarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 16:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Fitting and\nreconstruction techniques have been developed to determine the important\ngeometrical and physical CME properties. In many instances, there is\ndisagreement between such different methods but also between fitting from in\nsitu measurements and reconstruction based on remote imaging. Here, we compare\nthree methods based on different assumptions for measurements of thirteen CMEs\nby the Wind spacecraft from 1997 to 2015. These CMEs are selected from the\ninterplanetary coronal mass ejections catalog on\nhttps://wind.nasa.gov/ICMEindex.php due to their simplicity in terms of 1)\nsmall expansion speed throughout the CME and 2) little asymmetry in the\nmagnetic field profile. This makes these thirteen events ideal candidates to\ncompare codes that do not include expansion nor distortion. We find that, for\nthese simple events, the codes are in relatively good agreement in terms of the\nCME axis orientation for six out of the 13 events. Using the Grad-Shafranov\ntechnique, we can determine the shape of the cross-section, which is assumed to\nbe circular for the other two models, a force-free fitting and a\ncircular-cylindrical non-force-free fitting. Five of the events are found to\nhave a clear circular cross-section, even when this is not a pre-condition of\nthe reconstruction. We make an initial attempt at evaluating the adequacy of\nthe different assumptions for these simple CMEs. The conclusion of this work\nstrongly suggests that attempts at reconciling in situ and remote-sensing views\nof CMEs must take in consideration the compatibility of the different models\nwith specific CME structures to better reproduce flux ropes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 17:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-09"}

A recent study of disk evolution that includes magnetically driven\ndisk winds showed that the gas disk obtains a positive surface density slope\ninside ~ 1 au from the central star.

We investigate\nthe radial drift of planetesimals and type I migration of planetary embryos in\na disk that viscously evolves with magnetically driven disk winds.

This is specially true in dynamic languages\nsuch as Prolog. However, such run-time checks inevitably introduce run-time\noverhead (in execution time, memory, energy, etc.). Several approaches have\nbeen proposed for reducing such overhead, such as eliminating the checks that\ncan statically be proved to always succeed, and/or optimizing the way in which\nthe (remaining) checks are performed. However, there are cases in which it is\nnot possible to remove all checks statically (e.g., open libraries which must\ncheck their interfaces, complex properties, unknown code, etc.) and in which,\neven after optimizations, these remaining checks still may introduce an\nunacceptable level of overhead. It is thus important for programmers to be able\nto determine the additional cost due to the run-time checks and compare it to\nsome notion of admissible cost. The common practice used for estimating\nrun-time checking overhead is profiling, which is not exhaustive by nature.\nInstead, we propose a method that uses static analysis to estimate such\noverhead, with the advantage that the estimations are functions parameterized\nby input data sizes. Unlike profiling, this approach can provide guarantees for\nall possible execution traces, and allows assessing how the overhead grows as\nthe size of the input grows. Our method also extends an existing assertion\nverification framework to express \"admissible\" overheads, and statically and\nautomatically checks whether the instrumented program conforms with such\nspecifications. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our approach\nthat suggests that our method is feasible and promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 17:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-09"}

This turns out to be possible in spite of a very\ndifferent pattern displayed at low scales with $B_2=1.2$, $B_3=3.0$, $B_4=1.0$\nand $B_5\\approx 0.2$ in the large $N$ limit, $N$ being the number of colours.\nOur results imply that the inclusion of meson evolution in the phenomenology of\nany non-leptonic transition like $K^0-\\bar K^0$ mixing and $K\\to\\pi\\pi$ decays\nis mandatory. While meson evolution, as demonstrated in our paper, is hidden in\nLQCD results, to our knowledge DQCD is the only analytic approach for\nnon-leptonic transitions and decays which takes this important QCD dynamics\ninto account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Motivated by recent results from\nthe EDGES experiment, we revisit the standard calculation of the kinetic\ntemperature of the neutral gas through this period. When the first ultraviolet\n(UV) sources turn on, photons redshift into the Lyman lines of neutral hydrogen\nand repeatedly scatter within the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line. They heat the gas via\natomic recoils, and, through the Wouthuysen-Field effect, set the spin\ntemperature of the 21-cm hyperfine (spin-flip) line of atomic hydrogen in\ncompetition with the resonant cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons.

The coupling with the radio background can reduce\nthe depth of the 21-cm absorption feature by almost a factor of two relative to\nthe case with no sources of heating, and prevent the feature from developing a\nflattened bottom.

The proposed method is similar to previously developed nonlinear\nobservers in that it involves propagating the state estimate using a process\nmodel and corrects the propagated state estimate using an innovation term on\nthe tangent space of the Lie group. In the proposed method, the innovation term\nis constructed by passing the gradient of an invariant cost function, resolved\nin a basis of the tangent space, through a linear time-invariant system. The\nintroduction of the linear system completes the extension of linear\ncomplementary filters to nonlinear Lie group observers by allowing higher-order\nfiltering. In practice, the proposed method allows for greater design freedom\nand, with the appropriate selection of the linear filter, the ability to filter\nbias and noise over specific bandwidths. A disturbance observer that accounts\nfor constant and harmonic disturbances in group velocity measurements is also\nconsidered. Local asymptotic stability about the desired equilibrium point is\ndemonstrated. A numerical example that demonstrates the desirable properties of\nthe observer is presented in the context of pose estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 18:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

Our approach is the first\nto leverage this potential in practice: it captures the complete set of program\ntransformations used in state-of-the-art compilers, scales to medium-sized\nfunctions of up to 1000 instructions, and generates executable code. This level\nof practicality is reached by using constraint programming, a particularly\nsuitable combinatorial optimization technique. Unison, the implementation of\nour approach, is open source, used in industry, and integrated with the LLVM\ntoolchain.\n  An extensive evaluation confirms that Unison generates better code than LLVM\nwhile scaling to medium-sized functions. The evaluation uses systematically\nselected benchmarks from MediaBench and SPEC CPU2006 and different processor\narchitectures (Hexagon, ARM, MIPS). Mean estimated speedup ranges from 1.1% to\n10% and mean code size reduction ranges from 1.3% to 3.8% for the different\narchitectures. A significant part of this improvement is due to the integrated\nnature of the approach. Executing the generated code on Hexagon confirms that\nthe estimated speedup results in actual speedup. Given a fixed time limit,\nUnison solves optimally functions of up to 946 instructions, nearly an order of\nmagnitude larger than previous approaches.\n  The results show that our combinatorial approach can be applied in practice\nto trade compilation time for code quality beyond the usual compiler\noptimization levels, identify improvement opportunities in heuristic\nalgorithms, and fully exploit processor-specific features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 20:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 12:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 23:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 12:11:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 10:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is used as\nthe similarity measure to search for the optimal template candidates in\nfeature-spatial space in a video sequence. The computation of the EMD is\nformulated as the transportation problem from linear programming. The\nefficiency of the EMD optimization problem limits its use for visual tracking.\nTo alleviate this problem, a transportation-simplex method is used for EMD\noptimization and a monotonically convergent iterative optimization algorithm is\ndeveloped. The local sparse representation is used as the appearance models for\nthe iEMD tracker. The maximum-alignment-pooling method is used for constructing\na sparse coding histogram which reduces the computational complexity of the EMD\noptimization. The template update algorithm based on the EMD is also presented.\nThe iEMD tracking algorithm assumes small inter-frame movement in order to\nguarantee convergence. When the camera is mounted on a moving robot, e.g., a\nflying quadcopter, the camera could experience a sudden and rapid motion\nleading to large inter-frame movements. To ensure that the tracking algorithm\nconverges, a gyro-aided extension of the iEMD tracker is presented, where\nsynchronized gyroscope information is utilized to compensate for the rotation\nof the camera. The iEMD algorithm's performance is evaluated using eight\npublicly available datasets. The performance of the iEMD algorithm is compared\nwith seven state-of-the-art tracking algorithms based on relative percentage\noverlap.

The system differs\nfrom existing variational autoencoders (VAEs) in that the prior distribution\nused to model each code is conditioned on a similar code from the dataset. In\ncompression terms this equates to sequentially transmitting the dataset using\nan ordering determined by proximity in latent space. Since the prior need only\naccount for local, rather than global variations in the latent space, the\ncoding cost is greatly reduced, leading to rich, informative codes. Crucially,\nthe codes remain informative when powerful, autoregressive decoders are used,\nwhich we argue is fundamentally difficult with normal VAEs.

The\nTESLA cavity is equipped with two higher order mode couplers and a fundamental\npower coupler (FPC), which break the axial symmetry of the cavity. The passing\nelectrons therefore experience axially asymmetrical coupler kicks, which depend\non the transverse beam position at the couplers and the rf phase. The resulting\nemittance dilution has been studied in detail in the literature. However, the\nkick induced by the FPC depends explicitly on the ratio of the forward to the\nbackward traveling waves at the coupler, which has received little attention.\nThe intention of this paper is to present the concept of discrete coupler kicks\nwith a novel approach of separating the field disturbances related to the\nstanding wave and a reflection dependent part. Particular attention is directed\nto the role of the penetration depth of the FPC antenna, which determines the\nloaded quality factor of the cavity.

As one of the basic transportation\nfacilities in an urban setting, buses periodically run along their fixed routes\nand widely cover city streets. The trajectory of bus lines can be seen as a sub\nmap of a city. Based on the characters of bus networks, we propose a bus\ntrajectory-based street-centric routing algorithm (BTSC), which uses bus as\nmain relay to deliver message. In BTSC, we build a routing graph based on the\ntrajectories of bus lines by analyzing the probability of bus appearing on\nevery street. We propose two novel concepts, i.e. the probability of street\nconsistency (PSC) and the probability of path consistency (PPC) which is used\nas metrics to determine routing paths for message delivery. This aims to choose\nthe best path with higher density of busses and lower probability of\ntransmission direction deviating from the routing path. In order to improve the\nbus forwarding opportunity, we design a bus-based forwarding strategy with ant\ncolony optimization (FACO) to find a reliable and steady multi-hop link between\ntwo relay buses in order to decrease end-to-end delay.

An $\\varepsilon$-coreset\nis a weighted subset $S\\subseteq X$ with weight function $w : S \\rightarrow\n\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$, such that for any $k$-subset $C \\in [X]^k$, it holds that\n$\\sum_{x \\in S}{w(x) \\cdot d^z(x, C)} \\in (1 \\pm \\varepsilon) \\cdot \\sum_{x \\in\nX}{d^z(x, C)}$.\n  We present an efficient algorithm that constructs an $\\varepsilon$-coreset\nfor the $(k, z)$-clustering problem in $M(X, d)$, where the size of the coreset\nonly depends on the parameters $k, z, \\varepsilon$ and the doubling dimension\n$\\mathsf{ddim}(M)$.

It is a notorious open problem to\neither show an algorithm for edge coloring running in time $2^{o(n^2)}$ or to\nrefute it, assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) or other well established\nassumption.\n  We notice that the same question can be asked for list edge coloring, a\nwell-studied generalization of edge coloring where every edge comes with a set\n(often called a list) of allowed colors.

We show\nthat the polar microwave brightness temperature is highly correlated with the\npolar magnetic field strength and the fast solar wind speed. We also show that\nthe polar microwave brightness at one cycle is correlated with the low latitude\nbrightness with a lag of about half a solar cycle. We use this correlation to\npredict the strength of the solar cycle: the smoothed sunspot numbers in the\nsouthern and northern hemispheres can be predicted as 89 and 59, respectively.\nThese values indicate that cycle 25 will not be too different from cycle 24 in\nits strength. We also combined the rush to the pole data from Nobeyama\nprominences with historical data going back to 1860 to study the north-south\nasymmetry of sign reversal at solar poles. We find that the reversal asymmetry\nhas a quasi-periodicity of 3-5 cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2018 11:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Accordingly, to capture\nlow, medium and high frequencies we seek a digraph (D)GFT such that the\northonormal frequency components are as spread as possible in the graph\nspectral domain. To that end, we advocate a two-step design whereby we: (i)\nfind the maximum directed variation (i.e., a novel notion of frequency on a\ndigraph) a candidate basis vector can attain; and (ii) minimize a smooth\nspectral dispersion function over the achievable frequency range to obtain the\ndesired spread DGFT basis.

To do this, we design a\nSimple first-order Probabilistic Programming Language (SPPL) that contains a\nsufficient set of language restrictions together with a compilation scheme.\nThis enables us to preserve both the statistical and syntactic interpretation\nof if-else statements in the probabilistic program, within the scope of\nfirst-order PPLs. We also provide a corresponding mathematical formalism that\nensures any joint density denoted in such a language has a suitably low measure\nof discontinuities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2018 09:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 16:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

This yields a temperature-independent,\nBoltzmann-type \"entropy\" which is equivalent to the boundary action and which\nwe call m-entropy. According to its statistical interpretation, the m-entropy\ndistribution as a function of the gravitational field is maximum when\nEinstein's Field Equations hold. However, if the number of \"atoms of space\" is\nsmall, Einstein's Equations do not hold and no sharp geometry can be defined.\nOn the other hand, the transition probability of microstates can be computed\nand can be interpreted as processes of a (alternative) model of quantum\nspace-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2018 15:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

This led to\nconsider a different set of the twist matrices $\\Omega_{\\mu}$ relative to\n$T^{2}_{NC}$, since the corrisponding set, adopted in previous works, has\nresulted to be incompatible with the homogeneity of $T^{2}_{NC}$. We have also\nfound that the index labelling the twists $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ no longer has the\nusual physical role. In fact, the energy, suitably rewritten, of the minimum\nconfigurations at the point of Bogomolny and the quark color-electric charge\n$q_{e}$ depend on\n$r_{\\theta}=\\theta_{C}/\\theta_{NC}\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, where\n$\\theta_{C}$ ($\\theta_{NC}$) is the parameter that characterizes the\ncommutative torus $T^{2}_{C}$ ($T^{2}_{NC}$): here $T^{2}_{C}$ is not\ncharacterized only by a $\\theta$ null. The quantity $r_{\\theta}$ was then found\nto determine the order of a cyclic subgroup of $U(1)$ generated by\n$e^{i\\pi\\theta_{NC}}$. Therefore here $q_{e}$ can also be a fraction as well as\na multiple of $g^{-1}$, where $g$ is the magnetic charge of the scalar field.\nFurthermore, the above energy was calculated only considering a class of the\ntwisted boundary conditions solutions without solving, as usual, any system of\nequations such as the BPS. Another novelty is the presence of a double Higgs\nmechanism regulated by $r_{\\theta}$. In this regard, it predicts, in general, a\nnon null mass for the usual massless Goldstone boson and establishes a relation\nbetween the mass spectrum and $r_{\\theta}$ according to which a variation over\ntime of $r_{\\theta}$ involves a quantized variation in time of such masses that\nwill be null when $r_{\\theta}$ assumes values outside a certain interval of\nvalues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 18:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}
