The framework has\nbeen initially designed to handle submodular optimization under various types\nof constraints, that is, intersections of exchange systems (including\nmatroids), knapsacks, and unsplittable flows on trees. Later on, it turned out\nthat this framework perfectly extends to optimization under uncertainty, like\nstochastic probing and online selection problems, which further can be applied\nto mechanism design.\n  We add to this line of work by showing how to create contention resolution\nschemes for intersection of matroids and knapsacks when we work in the random\norder setting. More precisely, we do know the whole universe of elements in\nadvance, but they appear in an order given by a random permutation.

It is proved that the 5 types of vortices recently proposed by Manton\nare symmetry reductions of (A)SDYM equations with suitable gauge groups and\nsymmetry groups acting as isometries in a 4-manifold. As a consequence, the\ntwistor integrability results of such vortices can be derived. It is presented\na natural definition of their kinetic energy and thus the metric of the moduli\nspace was calculated by the Samols' localisation method. Then, a modified\nversion of the Abelian-Higgs model is proposed in such a way that spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking and the Bogomolny argument still hold. The Painlev\\'e test,\nwhen applied to its soliton equations, reveals a complete list of its\nintegrable cases. The corresponding solutions are given in terms of third\nPainlev\\'e transcendents and can be interpreted as original vortices on\nsurfaces with conical singularity.\n  The last two chapters present the following results in projective\ndifferential geometry and Hamiltonians of hydrodynamic-type (HT) systems.

In this paper, we first bring together various probabilistic\ninequalities for sums of independent random variables under much more general\nexponential type (namely sub-Weibull) tail assumptions. These results extract a\npart sub-Gaussian tail behavior in finite samples, matching the asymptotics\ngoverned by the central limit theorem, and are compactly represented in terms\nof a new Orlicz quasi-norm - the Generalized Bernstein-Orlicz norm - that\ntypifies such tail behaviors.\n  We illustrate the usefulness of these inequalities through the analysis of\nfour fundamental problems in HD statistics. In the first two problems, we study\nthe rate of convergence of the sample covariance matrix in terms of the maximum\nelementwise norm and the maximum k-sub-matrix operator norm which are key\nquantities of interest in bootstrap, HD covariance matrix estimation and HD\ninference. The third example concerns the restricted eigenvalue condition,\nrequired in HD linear regression, which we verify for all sub-Weibull random\nvectors through a unified analysis, and also prove a more general result\nrelated to restricted strong convexity in the process. In the final example, we\nconsider the Lasso estimator for linear regression and establish its rate of\nconvergence under much weaker than usual tail assumptions (on the errors as\nwell as the covariates), while also allowing for misspecified models and both\nfixed and random design.

Hostile\nactors, such as extremist groups or foreign governments, utilize these networks\nto run propaganda campaigns with different aims. For extremists, these\ncampaigns are designed for recruiting new members or inciting violence. For\nforeign governments, the aim may be to create instability in rival nations.\nProper social network counter-measures are needed to combat these threats. Here\nwe present one important counter-measure: penetrating social networks. This\nmeans making target users connect with or follow agents deployed in the social\nnetwork. Once such connections are established with the targets, the agents can\ninfluence them by sharing content which counters the influence campaign. In\nthis work we study how to penetrate a social network, which we call the\nfollow-back problem. The goal here is to find a policy that maximizes the\nnumber of targets that follow the agent.\n  We conduct an empirical study to understand what behavioral and network\nfeatures affect the probability of a target following an agent. We find that\nthe degree of the target and the size of the mutual neighborhood of the agent\nand target in the network affect this probability. Based on our empirical\nfindings, we then propose a model for targets following an agent. Using this\nmodel, we solve the follow-back problem exactly on directed acyclic graphs and\nderive a closed form expression for the expected number of follows an agent\nreceives under the optimal policy. We then formulate the follow-back problem on\nan arbitrary graph as an integer program. To evaluate our integer program based\npolicies, we conduct simulations on real social network topologies in Twitter.\nWe find that our polices result in more effective network penetration, with\nsignificant increases in the expected number of targets that follow the agent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 00:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

In this regard, we investigate the\nchromospheric response during various phases of a B6.4 flare on August 20,\n2005. Spatio-temporal investigation of flare ribbon enhancement during the\nprecursor phase, carried out using spectra-images recorded in several\nwavelength positions on the H-alpha line profile, revealed its delayed response\n(180 seconds) compared to the X-ray emission, as well as sequential increment\nin the width of the line-profile which are indicative of a slow heating\nprocess.

Therefore, our multi-wavelength diagnostics\nand hydrodynamical modeling of the precursor emission indicates the role of a\ntwo-stage process.

The Hermite\npolynomial expansion and a set of discrete velocity with isotropy are adopted\nto solve the kinetic moments of discrete equilibrium distribution function.\nSuch a model possesses both an adjustable specific heat ratio and Prandtl\nnumber, and can be applied to a wide range of flow regimes including\ncontinuous, slip, and transition flows. To recover results for actual\nsituations, the nondimensionalization process is demonstrated. To verify and\nvalidate the new model, several typical non-equilibrium flows including the\nCouette flow, Fourier flow, unsteady boundary heating problem, cavity flow, and\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability are simulated. Comparisons are made between the\nresults of discrete Boltzmann model and those of previous models including\nanalytic solution in slip flow, Lattice ES-BGK, and DSMC based on both BGK and\nhard-sphere models. The results show that the new model can accurately capture\nthe velocity slip and temperature jump near the wall, and show excellent\nperformance in predicting the non-equilibrium flow even in transition flow\nregime.

The nonequilibrium characteristics and the advantage of using\n$D^*_n$ in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are discussed. It concludes that the\nnon-equilibrium strength $D^*_n$ is more appropriate to describe the interfaces\nthan the individual components of $Delta^*_n$.

A natural\napplication of the clockwork mechanism is to the freeze-in mechanism for dark\nmatter production. Here we consider a Higgs portal freeze-in dark matter model\nbased on a scalar clockwork sector with a mass scale which is less than the\nHiggs boson mass. The dark matter scalar is the lightest scalar of the\nclockwork sector. Freeze-in dark matter is produced by the decay of thermal\nHiggs bosons to the clockwork dark matter scalars. We show that the mass of the\ndark matter scalar is typically in the 1-10 keV range and may be warm enough to\nhave an observable effect on perturbation growth and Lyman-$\\alpha$\nobservations. Clockwork Higgs portal freeze-in models have a potentially\nobservable collider phenomenology, with the Higgs boson decaying to missing\nenergy in the form of pairs of long-lived clockwork sector scalars, plus a\ndistribution of different numbers of quark and lepton particle-antiparticle\npairs. The branching ratio to different numbers of quark and lepton pairs is\ndetermined by the clockwork sector parameters (the number of clockwork scalars\n$N$ and the clockwork charge $q$), which could therefore be determined\nexperimentally if such Higgs decay modes are observed. In the case of a minimal\nStandard Model observable sector, the combination of nucleosynthesis and\nLyman-$\\alpha$ constraints is likely to exclude on-shell Higgs decays to\nclockwork scalars, although off-shell Higgs decays would still be possible.\nOn-shell Higgs decays to clockwork scalars can be consistent with cosmological\nconstraints in simple extensions of the Standard Model with light singlet\nscalars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 09:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 13:57:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 08:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The method is based on the $1/Z$ expansion for the density matrix\nof the system. In each order, the ground state energy is found neglecting the\nhigher-order correlations between the sites, as long as the set of equations\nremains non-singular. The conditions of the appearance of a singularity,\nequivalent to the disappearance of energy gap in the given approximation, can\nbe directly obtained from the equations.

J-PLUS sources exhibit two\ndistinct populations in the r-band magnitude vs. concentration plane,\ncorresponding to compact and extended sources. We modelled the two-population\ndistribution with a skewed Gaussian for compact objects and a log-normal\nfunction for the extended ones. The derived model and the number density prior\nbased on J-PLUS EDR data were used to estimate the Bayesian probability of a\nsource to be star or galaxy. This procedure was applied pointing-by-pointing to\naccount for varying observing conditions and sky position. Finally, we combined\nthe morphological information from g, r, and i broad bands in order to improve\nthe classification of low signal-to-noise sources. The derived probabilities\nare used to compute the pointing-by-pointing number counts of stars and\ngalaxies. The former increases as we approach to the Milky Way disk, and the\nlatter are similar across the probed area. The comparison with SDSS in the\ncommon regions is satisfactory up to r ~ 21, with consistent numbers of stars\nand galaxies, and consistent distributions in concentration and (g - i) colour\nspaces. We implement a morphological star/galaxy classifier based on PDF\nanalysis, providing meaningful probabilities for J-PLUS sources to one\nmagnitude deeper (r ~ 21) than a classical boolean classification. These\nprobabilities are suited for the statistical study of 150k stars and 101k\ngalaxies with 15 < r < 21 present in the 31.7 deg2 of the J-PLUS EDR. In a\nfuture version of the classifier, we will include J-PLUS colour information\nfrom twelve photometric bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 11:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Also, the extracted information for each type of blocks\nis embedded in another block with the same type. So, changes in the smooth\nareas are invisible to Human Visual System.

For removing rain effect from a single image, deep leaning\ntechniques have been attracting considerable attentions. This paper designs a\nnovel multi-task leaning architecture in an end-to-end manner to reduce the\nmapping range from input to output and boost the performance. Concretely, a\ndecomposition net is built to split rain images into clean background and rain\nlayers. Different from previous architectures, our model consists of, besides a\ncomponent representing the desired clean image, an extra component for the rain\nlayer. During the training phase, we further employ a composition structure to\nreproduce the input by the separated clean image and rain information for\nimproving the quality of decomposition. Experimental results on both synthetic\nand real images are conducted to reveal the high-quality recovery by our\ndesign, and show its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, our design is also applicable to other layer decomposition tasks\nlike dust removal. More importantly, our method only requires about 50ms,\nsignificantly faster than the competitors, to process a testing image in VGA\nresolution on a GTX 1080 GPU, making it attractive for practical use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 13:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

We address this limitation for the first time and\ndevelop a framework for the comparative analysis of stochastic learning\ndynamics with different update rules but same steady-state behavior. We present\nthe framework in the context of two learning dynamics: Log-Linear Learning\n(LLL) and Metropolis Learning (ML). Although both of these dynamics have the\nsame stochastically stable states, LLL and ML correspond to different\nbehavioral models for decision making. Moreover, we demonstrate through an\nexample setup of sensor coverage game that for each of these dynamics, the\npaths to stochastically stable states exhibit distinctive behaviors.

We derive and\ncompare upper bounds on the expected hitting time to the set of Nash equilibria\nfor both LLL and ML. For the medium to long-run behavior, we identify a set of\ntools from the theory of perturbed Markov chains that result in a hierarchical\ndecomposition of the state space into collections of states called cycles.

Traditional\nprocess discovery methods extract process models from a snapshot of an event\nlog stored in its entirety. In some scenarios, however, events keep coming with\na high arrival rate to the extent that it is impractical to store the entire\nevent log and to continuously re-discover a process model from scratch. Such\nscenarios require online process discovery approaches. Given an event stream\nproduced by the execution of a business process, the goal of an online process\ndiscovery method is to maintain a continuously updated model of the process\nwith a bounded amount of memory while at the same time achieving similar\naccuracy as offline methods. However, existing online discovery approaches\nrequire relatively large amounts of memory to achieve levels of accuracy\ncomparable to that of offline methods. Therefore, this paper proposes an\napproach that addresses this limitation by mapping the problem of online\nprocess discovery to that of cache memory management, and applying well-known\ncache replacement policies to the problem of online process discovery. The\napproach has been implemented in .NET, experimentally integrated with the Minit\nprocess mining tool and comparatively evaluated against an existing baseline\nusing real-life datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 15:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

To illustrate this connection between macroscopic\nobservables and microphysics, we review calculations of vortex interactions\nfocusing on Kelvin wave excitations and determine the corresponding mutual\nfriction strength for realistic microscopic parameters in the inner crust.\nThese density-dependent crustal coupling profiles are combined with a\nsimplified treatment of the core coupling and implemented in a three-component\nneutron star model to construct a predictive framework for glitch rises. As a\nresult of the density-dependent dynamics, we find the superfluid to transfer\nangular momentum to different parts of the crust and the core on different\ntimescales. This can cause the spin frequency change to become non-monotonic in\ntime, allowing for a maximum value much larger than the measured glitch size,\nas well as a delay in the recovery. The exact shape of the calculated glitch\nrise is strongly dependent on the relative strength between the crust and core\nmutual friction, providing the means to probe not only the crustal superfluid\nbut also the deeper neutron star interior. To demonstrate the potential of this\napproach, we compare our predictive model with the first pulse-to-pulse\nobservations recorded during the December 2016 glitch of the Vela pulsar. Our\nanalysis suggests that the glitch rise behavior is relatively insensitive to\nthe crustal mutual friction strength as long as $\\mathcal{B} \\gtrsim 10^{-3}$,\nwhile being strongly dependent on the core coupling strength, which we find to\nbe in the range $3 \\times 10^{-5} \\lesssim \\mathcal{B}_{\\rm core} \\lesssim\n10^{-4}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 15:54:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 20:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 22:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

For 3D\npoint data, this \"orthogonal Procrustes problem\" is often phrased in terms of\nminimizing a root-mean-square deviation or RMSD corresponding to a Euclidean\ndistance measure relating the two sets of matched coordinates. We focus on\nquaternion eigensystem methods that have been exploited to solve this problem\nfor at least five decades in several different bodies of scientific literature\nwhere they were discovered independently. While numerical methods for the\neigenvalue solutions dominate much of this literature, it has long been\nrealized that the quaternion-based RMSD optimization problem can also be solved\nusing exact algebraic expressions based on the form of the quartic equation\nsolution published by Cardano in 1545; we focus on these exact solutions to\nexpose the structure of the entire eigensystem for the traditional 3D spatial\nalignment problem. We then explore the structure of the less-studied\norientation data context, investigating how quaternion methods can be extended\nto solve the corresponding 3D quaternion orientation frame alignment (QFA)\nproblem, noting the interesting equivalence of this problem to the\nrotation-averaging problem, which also has been the subject of independent\nliterature threads. We conclude with a brief discussion of the combined 3D\ntranslation-orientation data alignment problem.
