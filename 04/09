To this aim, since the likelihood function of the\nMD simulation models are intractable in absence of Gaussianity assumption, we\nuse a likelihood-free inference scheme known as approximate Bayesian\ncomputation (ABC) and propose an adaptive population Monte Carlo ABC algorithm,\nwhich is illustrated to converge faster and scales better than previously used\nABCsubsim algorithm for calibration of force-field of a helium system. The\nsecond contribution is the adaptation of ABC algorithms for High Performance\nComputing to MD simulation within the Python ecosystem ABCpy. We illustrate the\nperformance of the developed methodology to learn posterior distribution and\nBayesian estimates of Lennard-Jones force-field parameters of helium and TIP4P\nsystem of water implemented both for simulated and experimental datasets\ncollected using Neutron and X-ray diffraction. For simulated data, the Bayesian\nestimate is in close agreement with the true parameter value used to generate\nthe dataset. For experimental as well as for simulated data, the Bayesian\nposterior distribution shows a strong correlation pattern between the\nforce-field parameters. Providing an estimate of the entire posterior\ndistribution, our methodology also allows us to perform uncertainty\nquantification of model prediction. This research opens up the possibility to\nrigorously calibrate force-fields from available experimental datasets of any\nstructural and dynamic property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 19:22:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 11:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

For the smooth wall case (no ribs)\nand the case of ribs on the inner cylinder only, we observe strong drag\nreduction up to $DR=33\\%$ and $DR=23\\%$, respectively, for a void fraction of\n$\\alpha=6\\%$. However, with ribs mounted on both cylinders or on the outer\ncylinder only, the drag reduction is weak, less than $DR=11\\%$, and thus quite\nclose to the trivial effect of reduced effective density.

Relying on\ncharacter bounds due to Larsen and Shalev [2008], we show that for large enough\n$n$, if $\\Sigma\\subset S_{n}$ is a full conjugacy class, then the second\neigenvalue of $\\mathrm{Cay}\\left(S_{n},\\Sigma\\right)$ is roughly identical to\nthe second eigenvalue of the Schreier graph depicting the action of $S_{n}$ on\nordered $4$-tuples of elements from $\\left\\{ 1,\\ldots,n\\right\\}$. We further\nshow that this type of result does not hold when $\\Sigma$ is an arbitrary\nnormal set, but a slightly weaker one does hold. We state a conjecture in the\nsame spirit regarding an arbitrary symmetric set $\\Sigma\\subset S_{n}$, which\nyields surprisingly strong consequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2018 23:43:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 08:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 11:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

One of the long-standing\nchallenges in magnetic drug delivery is the inability to generate 3D\naggregation non-invasively within the interior of the body. Earnshaw's theorem,\nwhich proves the impossibility of creating an energetic minimum in a curl-free\nand divergence-free field such as a magnetic field. However, one of the\nassumptions of Earnshaw's theorem is a static field. Here we show that it is\npossible to utilize a dynamically changing field and a dissipative force such\nas the drag, which is generally present, to create a stable aggregation point\nfor magnetic particles. We also introduce a theoretical framework for designing\nthe suitable magnetic fields for controlling a given magnetic particle in a\nparticular fluid. This framework enables accurate determination of the\nnecessary parameters for aggregation across a wide variety of magnetic\nparticles and across multiple biologically-relevant fluids. By coating magnetic\nparticles with desired therapeutic agents or attaching them to cells, a new\nclass of treatment methodologies can be created in therapies such as targeted\ndrug delivery and cell-based therapies. By dynamically changing the aggregation\npoint, agents can also be guided along a particular path in the body. This\ntechnique of using dissipative forces to create a stable 3D aggregation point\nfor particles could possibly be extended to a broad range of applications such\nas microscopic and macroscopic manipulation, robotics, guided self-assembly,\nmagnetic plasma confinement, tissue engineering, and ion traps for quantum\ncomputers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 00:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

A key\ningredient of our greedy algorithm is a routine for maintaining effective\nresistances under edge additions in an online-offline hybrid setting.\n  - We show the exponential inapproximability of this problem by proving that\nthere exists a constant $c > 0$ such that it is NP-hard to approximate the\noptimum number of spanning trees in the exponent within $(1 - c)$. This\ninapproximability result follows from a reduction from the minimum path cover\nin undirected graphs, whose hardness again follows from the constant\ninapproximability of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with distances 1 and\n2. Thus, the approximation ratio of our algorithm is also optimal up to a\nconstant factor in the exponent.

We demonstrate how these integrity indices\ncan be used to study the dynamic behavior of the power system. Furthermore, a\ncomparison analysis is conducted between the synchronization coefficient (KS)\nand the generator rotor angle correlation coefficient (CC). The proposed\nindices demonstrate the dynamic behavior of power system following occurrence\nthe faults and thus represent a promising approach in power system islanding\nstudies.

Compared to\ndistance-based rigidity, weak rigidity requires fewer constrained edges in the\ngraph to determine a geometric shape in an arbitrarily dimensional space. A\nnecessary and sufficient graphical condition for infinitesimal weak rigidity of\nplanar frameworks is derived. As an application of the proposed weak rigidity\ntheory, a gradient based control law and a non-gradient based control law are\ndesigned for a group of single-integrator modeled agents to stabilize a desired\nformation shape, respectively. Using the gradient control law, we prove that an\ninfinitesimally weakly rigid formation is locally exponentially stable. In\nparticular, if the number of agents is one greater than the dimension of the\nspace, a minimally infinitesimally weakly rigid formation is almost globally\nasymptotically stable. In the literature of rigid formation, the sensing graph\nis always required to be rigid. Using the non-gradient control law based on\nweak rigidity theory, the sensing graph is unnecessary to be rigid for local\nexponential stability of the formation.

The caching policy allows a user to determine whether and how\nlong it should cache a content item according to the prediction of its random\nrequest time, also referred to as the request delay information (RDI). In\nparticular, the aim is to maximize the caching gain for communications while\nlimiting its storage cost. To achieve this goal, a queueing theoretic model for\ncaching with infinite buffers is first formulated, in which Little's law is\nadopted to obtain the tradeoff between the hit ratio and the average buffer\nconsumption. When there exist multiple content classes with different RDIs, the\nstorage efficiency is further optimized by carefully allocating the storage\ncost. For more practical finite-buffer caching, a $G/GI/L/0$ queue model is\nformulated, in which a diffusion approximation and Erlang-B formula are adopted\nto determine the buffer overflow probability and the corresponding hit ratio.\nThe optimal hit ratio is shown to be limited by the demand probability and\nbuffer size for large and small buffers respectively.

Interestingly, the popular split-step Fourier method (SSFM) leads to a\ncomputation graph that is reminiscent of a deep neural network. This\nobservation allows one to leverage tools from machine learning to reduce\ncomplexity. In particular, the main disadvantage of the SSFM is that its\ncomplexity using M steps is at least M times larger than a linear equalizer.\nThis is because the linear SSFM operator is a dense matrix. In previous work,\ntruncation methods such as frequency sampling, wavelets, or least-squares have\nbeen used to obtain \"cheaper\" operators that can be implemented using filters.\nHowever, a large number of filter taps are typically required to limit\ntruncation errors. For example, Ip and Kahn showed that for a 10 Gbaud signal\nand 2000 km optical link, a truncated SSFM with 25 steps would require 70-tap\nfilters in each step and 100 times more operations than linear equalization. We\nfind that, by jointly optimizing all filters with deep learning, the complexity\ncan be reduced significantly for similar accuracy. Using optimized 5-tap and\n3-tap filters in an alternating fashion, one requires only around 2-6 times the\ncomplexity of linear equalization, depending on the implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 02:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

However, due to limited computing, overload interference and\ncluster-level unreachable troubles, efficient execution in the edges is hard,\nwhich obstructs the guarantee on the efficiency and reliability of jobs.\nLaunching copies across clusters can be an insurance on a task's completion.\nConsidering cluster heterogeneity and accompanying remote data fetch, cluster\nselection of copies affects execution quality, as different insuring plans\ndrive different revenues. For providing On-Line-Real-Time analysis results, a\nsystem needs to insure the geo-distributed resource for the arriving jobs. Our\nchallenge is to achieve the optimal revenue by dynamically weighing the gains\ndue to insurance against the loss of occupying extra resource for insuring.\n  To this end, we design PingAn, an online insurance algorithm promising\n$(1+\\varepsilon)\\!\\!-\\!speed \\\no(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2+\\varepsilon})\\!\\!-\\!competitive$ in sum of the job\nflowtimes via cross-cluster copying for tasks.

A thorough understanding of mmWave\nsignal propagation through the wireless channel provides valuable insights for\nthe design of such networks which in turn dictates the achievable performance\nlimits. High path loss, penetration loss, and negligible signal scattering are\ncertain distinctive features of the mmWave channel which necessitates the\ndevelopment of new mathematical models. Importantly, the impact of directional\nantennas which spatially filter multi-path components needs to be embodied as\nan integral part of the channel model. In this paper, we model outdoor\ndirectional non-line-of-sight mmWave channels using a combination of stochastic\ngeometry and image theory by expressing channel parameters as joint functions\nof transmitter-receiver separation distance, antenna half power beamwidth, and\nantenna beam pointing direction. By approximating the signal propagation path\ndue to first and second order reflections from buildings, closed form\nanalytical expressions for average number of first order reflection components,\npath loss, and root-mean square delay spread of channel are derived.

Solar activity cycles vary in amplitude and duration. The variations\ncan be at least partly explained by fluctuations in dynamo parameters. Aims. We\nwant to restrict uncertainty in fluctuating dynamo parameters and find out\nwhich properties of the fluctuations control the amplitudes of the magnetic\nfield and energy in variable dynamo cycles. Methods. A flux-transport model for\nthe solar dynamo with fluctuations of the Babcock-Leighton type $\\alpha$-effect\nwas applied to generate statistics of magnetic cycles for our purposes. The\nstatistics were compared with data on solar cycle periods to restrict the\ncorrelation time of dynamo fluctuations. Results. A characteristic time of\nfluctuations in the $\\alpha$-effect is estimated to be close to the solar\nrotation period. The fluctuations produce asymmetry between the times of rise\nand descent of dynamo cycles, the rise time being on average shorter. The\naffect of the fluctuations on cycle amplitudes depends on the phase of the\ncycle in which the fluctuations occur. Negative fluctuations (decrease in\n$\\alpha$) in the rise phase delay decay of poloidal field and increase the\ncycle amplitude in toroidal field and magnetic energy. Negative fluctuation in\nthe decline phase reduces the polar field at the end of a cycle and the\namplitude of the next cycle. The low amplitude of the 24th solar cycle compared\nto the preceding 23rd cycle can be explained by this effect. Positive\nfluctuations in the descent phase enhance the magnetic energy of the next cycle\nby increasing the seed poloidal field for the next cycle.

These two difficulties limited\ntheir practicality largely. Based on Whale Swarm Algorithm (WSA) we proposed\npreviously, this paper presents a new multimodal optimizer named WSA with\nIterative Counter (WSA-IC) to address these two difficulties. In the one hand,\nWSA-IC improves the iteration rule of the original WSA for multimodal\noptimization, which removes the need of specifying different values of\nattenuation coefficient for different problems to form multiple subpopulations,\nwithout introducing any niching parameter. In the other hand, WSA-IC enables\nthe identification of extreme point during iterations relying on two new\nparameters (i.e., stability threshold Ts and fitness threshold Tf), to jump out\nof the located extreme point. Moreover, the convergence of WSA-IC is proved.\nFinally, the proposed WSA-IC is compared with several niching metaheuristic\nalgorithms on CEC2015 niching benchmark test functions and five additional\nclassical multimodal functions with high dimensions.

Our\ngoal is to verify whether or not the S2 star wind can be used as a diagnostic\ntool to infer the properties of the accretion flow towards Sgr A* at its\npericentre (an unprobed distance regime), putting important constraints on BH\naccretion flow models.

These are\npost-processed to derive the X-ray emission in the observable 2-10 keV window.\nNo significant excess of X-ray emission from Sgr A* is found for typical\naccretion flow models. A measurable excess is produced for a significantly\nincreased density of the accretion flow.

The first step of 3D-PIV is to reconstruct the 3D\nlocations of the tracer particles from synchronous views of the volume. We\npropose a new method for iterative particle reconstruction (IPR), in which the\nlocations and intensities of all particles are inferred in one joint energy\nminimization. The energy function is designed to penalize deviations between\nthe reconstructed 3D particles and the image evidence, while at the same time\naiming for a sparse set of particles.

The most favorable stars for disk\ndetection are those with spectral types between A and K, while the statistics\nfor debris disks detected around low-mass M-type stars is very low, either\nbecause they are rare or because they are more difficult to detect. Terrestrial\nplanets, on the other hand, may be common around M-type stars. Here, we report\non the discovery of an extended (likely) debris disk around the M-dwarf GSC\n07396-00759. The star is a wide companion of the close accreting binary V4046\nSgr. The system probably is a member of the $\\beta$ Pictoris Moving Group. We\nresolve the disk in scattered light, exploiting high-contrast, high-resolution\nimagery with the two near-infrared subsystems of the VLT/SPHERE instrument,\noperating in the YJ bands and the H2H3 doublet. The disk is clearly detected up\nto 1.5\" ($\\sim110$ au) from the star and appears as a ring, with an inclination\n$i\\sim83$ degree, and a peak density position at $\\sim 70$ au. The spatial\nextension of the disk suggests that the dust dynamics is affected by a strong\nstellar wind, showing similarities with the AU Mic system that has also been\nresolved with SPHERE. The images show faint asymmetric structures at the widest\nseparation in the northwest side. We also set an upper limit for the presence\nof giant planets to $2 M_J$. Finally, we note that the 2 resolved disks around\nM-type stars of 30 such stars observed with SPHERE are viewed close to edge-on,\nsuggesting that a significant population of debris disks around M dwarfs could\nremain undetected because of an unfavorable orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 09:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 08:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

While the\nexistence of a circum-jovian disk is supported by hydrodynamic simulations, no\nconsensus exists regarding the origin and delivery mechanisms of the building\nblocks of the forming satellites. The opening of a gap in the circumsolar disk\nwould have efficiently isolated Jupiter from the main sources of solid\nmaterial. However, a reservoir of planetesimals should have existed at the\nouter edge of Jupiter's gap, where solids were trapped and accumulated over\ntime. Here we show that the formation of Saturn's core within this reservoir,\nor its prompt inward migration, allows planetesimals to be redistributed from\nthis reservoir towards Jupiter and the inner Solar System, thereby providing\nenough material to form the Galilean satellites and to populate the Main Belt\nwith primitive asteroids. We find that the orbit of planetesimals captured\nwithin the circumjovian disk are circularized through friction with gas in a\ncompact system comparable to the current radial extent of the Galilean\nsatellites. The decisive role of Saturn in the delivery mechanism has strong\nimplications for the occurrence of massive moons around extrasolar giant\nplanets as they would preferentially form around planets within multiple planet\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 10:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

A natural alternative in these situations would be the application of\nregression trees or random forests but, so far, no general distributional\nframework is available for these. Therefore, a framework for distributional\nregression trees and forests is proposed that blends regression trees and\nrandom forests with classical distributions from the GAMLSS framework as well\nas their censored or truncated counterparts.

When analyzing graphs, it is often useful to\ncompute scores describing the relative importance or distance between nodes.\nOne example is Personalized PageRank (PPR), which assigns to each node $v$ a\nvector whose $i$-th entry describes the importance of the $i$-th node from the\nperspective of $v$. PPR has proven useful in many applications, such as\nrecommending who users should follow on social networks (if this $i$-th entry\nis large, $v$ may be interested in following the $i$-th user). Unfortunately,\ncomputing $n$ such PPR vectors (where $n$ is the number of nodes) is infeasible\nfor many graphs of interest.\n  In this work, we argue that the situation is not so dire. Our main result\nshows that the dimensionality of the set of PPR vectors scales sublinearly in\n$n$ with high probability, for a certain class of random graphs and for a\nnotion of dimensionality similar to rank. Put differently, we argue that the\neffective dimension of this set is much less than $n$, despite the fact that\nthe matrix containing these vectors has rank $n$. Furthermore, we show this\ndimensionality measure relates closely to the complexity of a PPR estimation\nscheme that was proposed (but not analyzed) by Jeh and Widom. This allows us to\nargue that accurately estimating all $n$ PPR vectors amounts to computing a\nvanishing fraction of the $n^2$ vector elements (when the technical assumptions\nof our main result are satisfied).

However, on massively parallel hardware the\nperformance of these methods is typically limited by communication latency\nrather than floating point performance. With HPC hardware advancing towards the\nexascale regime the gap between computation and communication keeps steadily\nincreasing, imposing the need for scalable alternatives to traditional Krylov\nsubspace methods. One such approach are the so-called pipelined Krylov subspace\nmethods, which reduce the number of global synchronization points and overlap\nglobal communication latency with local arithmetic operations, thus hiding the\nglobal reduction phases behind useful computations. To obtain this overlap the\ntraditional Krylov subspace algorithm is reformulated by introducing a number\nof auxiliary vector quantities, which are computed using additional recurrence\nrelations. Although pipelined Krylov subspace methods are equivalent to\ntraditional Krylov subspace methods in exact arithmetic, local rounding errors\ninduced by the multi-term recurrence relations in finite precision may in\npractice affect convergence significantly. This numerical stability study aims\nto characterize the effect of local rounding errors on attainable accuracy in\nvarious pipelined versions of the popular Conjugate Gradient method.\nExpressions for the gaps between the true and recursively computed variables\nthat are used to update the search directions in the different CG variants are\nderived.

Particularly, DenseNet, which connects each layer to every\nother layer in a feed-forward fashion, has shown impressive performances in\nnatural image classification tasks. We propose HyperDenseNet, a 3D fully\nconvolutional neural network that extends the definition of dense connectivity\nto multi-modal segmentation problems. Each imaging modality has a path, and\ndense connections occur not only between the pairs of layers within the same\npath, but also between those across different paths. This contrasts with the\nexisting multi-modal CNN approaches, in which modeling several modalities\nrelies entirely on a single joint layer (or level of abstraction) for fusion,\ntypically either at the input or at the output of the network. Therefore, the\nproposed network has total freedom to learn more complex combinations between\nthe modalities, within and in-between all the levels of abstraction, which\nincreases significantly the learning representation.

In order to employ these\nmaterials, according transistor behavior should be adjustable and of high\nperformance. We show that the transistor performance of colloidal lead sulfide\nnanosheets is tunable by altering the surface passivation, the contact metal,\nor by exposing them to air. We found that adding halide ions to the synthesis\nleads to an improvement of the conductivity, the field-effect mobility, and the\non/off ratio of these transistors by passivating their surface defects.\nSuperior n-type behavior with a field-effect mobility of 248 cm^2V^-1s^-1 and\nan on/off ratio of 4x10^6 is achieved. The conductivity of these stripes can be\nchanged from n-type to p-type by altering the contact metal and by adding\noxygen to the working environment. As a possible solution for the post-Moore\nera, realizing new high quality semiconductors such as colloidal materials is\ncrucial. In this respect, our results can provide new insights which helps to\naccelerate their optimization for potential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 13:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

However, human perception of the\nsimilarity of two sketches will consider both structure and texture as\nessential factors and is not sensitive to slight (\"pixel-level\") mismatches.\nConsequently, the use of existing similarity measures can lead to better\nalgorithms receiving a lower score than worse algorithms. This unreliable\nevaluation has significantly hindered the development of the FSS field. To\nsolve this problem, we propose a novel and robust style similarity measure\ncalled Scoot-measure (Structure CO-Occurrence Texture Measure), which\nsimultaneously evaluates \"block-level\" spatial structure and co-occurrence\ntexture statistics. In addition, we further propose 4 new meta-measures and\ncreate 2 new datasets to perform a comprehensive evaluation of several\nwidely-used FSS measures on two large databases. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our measure not only provides a reliable evaluation but also\nachieves significantly improved performance.

The most recent\ntwo flashes on Jupiter were detected on 17 March 2016 and 26 May 2017 and are\nanalyzed here.

The rate of similar impacts\non Jupiter provides improved constraints on the total flux of impacts on the\nplanet, which can be compared to the amount of exogenic species detected in the\nupper atmosphere of Jupiter. We extracted light curves of the flashes and\ncalculated the masses and sizes of the impacting objects. An examination of the\nnumber of amateur observations of Jupiter as a function of time allows us to\ninterpret the statistics of these detections. The cumulative flux of small\nobjects (5-20 m or larger) that impact Jupiter is predicted to be low (10-65\nimpacts per year), and only a fraction of them are potentially observable from\nEarth (4-25 per year in a perfect survey). More impacts will be found in the\nnext years, with Jupiter opposition displaced toward summer in the northern\nhemisphere. Objects of this size contribute negligibly to the exogenous species\nand dust in the stratosphere of Jupiter when compared with the continuous flux\nfrom interplanetary dust punctuated by giant impacts.

Applications to the simulations of high Reynolds numbers flows\nwith vortical structures on relatively coarse grids are showcased, by focusing\non two-dimensional plane mixing-layer flows. Both Inf-Sup Stable (ISS) and\nEqual Order (EO) FE pairs are explored, using a second-order semi-implicit\nBackward Differentiation Formula (BDF2) in time. Based on the numerical\nstudies, it is concluded that the SUPG method using both ISS and EO FE pairs\nperforms best among all methods. Furthermore, there seems to be no reason to\nextend SUPG method by the higher order terms of the RB-VMS method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 14:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

To date, research effort has largely focussed on the\ndevelopment of Bayesian cubature, whose distributional output provides\nuncertainty quantification for the integral. However, the point estimators\nassociated to Bayesian cubature can be inaccurate and acutely sensitive to the\nprior when the domain is high-dimensional. To address these drawbacks we\nintroduce Bayes-Sard cubature, a probabilistic framework that combines the\nflexibility of Bayesian cubature with the robustness of classical cubatures\nwhich are well-established. This is achieved by considering a Gaussian process\nmodel for the integrand whose mean is a parametric regression model, with an\nimproper flat prior on each regression coefficient. The features in the\nregression model consist of test functions which are guaranteed to be exactly\nintegrated, with remaining degrees of freedom afforded to the non-parametric\npart. The asymptotic convergence of the Bayes-Sard cubature method is\nestablished and the theoretical results are numerically verified. In\nparticular, we report two orders of magnitude reduction in error compared to\nBayesian cubature in the context of a high-dimensional financial integral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 14:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 12:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 14:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

Since modeling all the possible world\ninteractions is unfeasible, learning from experience is required, posing the\nchallenge of collecting a large amount of experiences (i.e., training data).\nTypically, a manipulative robot operates on external objects by using its own\nhands (or similar end-effectors), but in some cases the use of tools may be\ndesirable, nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that while a robot can\ncollect many sensorimotor experiences using its own hands, this cannot happen\nfor all possible human-made tools.\n  Therefore, in this paper we investigate the developmental transition from\nhand to tool affordances: what sensorimotor skills that a robot has acquired\nwith its bare hands can be employed for tool use? By employing a visual and\nmotor imagination mechanism to represent different hand postures compactly, we\npropose a probabilistic model to learn hand affordances, and we show how this\nmodel can generalize to estimate the affordances of previously unseen tools,\nultimately supporting planning, decision-making and tool selection tasks in\nhumanoid robots.

In this work, we\ninvestigate how much randomness is required to transform a given quantum state\ninto another one. Specifically, we ask whether there is a gap between the power\nof a classical source of randomness compared to that of a quantum one. We\nprovide a complete answer to these questions, by identifying provably optimal\nprotocols for both classical and quantum sources of randomness, based on a\ndephasing construction. We find that in order to implement any noisy transition\non a $d$-dimensional quantum system it is necessary and sufficient to have a\nquantum source of randomness of dimension $\\sqrt{d}$ or a classical one of\ndimension $d$. Interestingly, coherences provided by quantum states in a source\nof randomness offer a quadratic advantage. The process we construct has the\nadditional features to be robust and catalytic, i.e., the source of randomness\ncan be re-used. Building upon this formal framework, we illustrate that this\ndephasing construction can serve as a useful primitive in both equilibration\nand quantum information theory: We discuss applications describing the smallest\nmeasurement device, capturing the smallest equilibrating environment allowed by\nquantum mechanics, or forming the basis for a cryptographic private quantum\nchannel. We complement the exact analysis with a discussion of approximate\nprotocols based on quantum expanders deriving from discrete Weyl systems.

Each sample\nalong with its k-nearest neighbors are joined into the k-nearest neighbor graph\nby performing the nearest neighbor search sequentially on the graph under\nconstruction. On the other hand, the built k-nearest neighbor graph is used to\nsupport k-nearest neighbor search. Since the graph is built online, the dynamic\nupdate on the graph, which is not possible from most of the existing solutions,\nis supported. This solution is feasible for various distance measures. Its\neffectiveness both as k-nearest neighbor construction and k-nearest neighbor\nsearch approaches is verified across different types of data in different\nscales, various dimensions and under different metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 14:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 12:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 11:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 00:17:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 06:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

Almost all existing work processes the acquired\nmulti-view video in two separate steps, utilizing either a pure Eulerian or\npure Lagrangian approach. Eulerian methods perform a voxel-based reconstruction\nof particles per time step, followed by 3D motion estimation, with some form of\ndense matching between the precomputed voxel grids from different time steps.\nIn this sequential procedure, the first step cannot use temporal consistency\nconsiderations to support the reconstruction, while the second step has no\naccess to the original, high-resolution image data. Alternatively, Lagrangian\nmethods reconstruct an explicit, sparse set of particles and track the\nindividual particles over time. Physical constraints can only be incorporated\nin a post-processing step when interpolating the particle tracks to a dense\nmotion field. We show, for the first time, how to jointly reconstruct both the\nindividual tracer particles and a dense 3D fluid motion field from the image\ndata, using an integrated energy minimization. Our hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian\nmodel reconstructs individual particles, and at the same time recovers a dense\n3D motion field in the entire domain. Making particles explicit greatly reduces\nthe memory consumption and allows one to use the high-res input images for\nmatching. Whereas the dense motion field makes it possible to include physical\na-priori constraints and account for the incompressibility and viscosity of the\nfluid. The method exhibits greatly (~70%) improved results over our recently\npublished baseline with two separate steps for 3D reconstruction and motion\nestimation.

It can enhance control performances to explicitly\nconsider wind power uncertainty distributions within controller design.\nHowever, widely accepted wind uncertainties usually follow non-Gaussian\ndistributions which may lead to complicated stochastic AGC modeling and high\ncomputational burdens. To overcome the issue, this paper presents a novel\nIto-theory-based model for the stochastic control problem (SCP) of AGC systems,\nwhich reduces the computational burden of optimization considering non-Gaussian\nwind power uncertainty to the same scale as that for deterministic control\nproblems. We present an Ito process model to exactly describe non-Gaussian wind\npower uncertainty, and then propose an SCP based on the concept of stochastic\nassessment functions (SAFs). Based on a convergent series expansion of the SAF,\nthe SCP is reformulated as a certain deterministic control problem without\nsacrificing performance under non-Gaussian wind power uncertainty. The\nreformulated control problem is proven as a convex optimization which can be\nsolved efficiently. A case study demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of\nthe proposed approach compared with several conventional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 14:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

It was previously found that radiation mediated shocks\n(RMSs) inside GRB jets are inefficient photon producers, and the photons that\nmediate the RMS must originate from an earlier stage of the explosion. We show\nthat this conclusion is valid only for non-magnetized jets. RMSs that propagate\nin moderately magnetized plasma develop a collisionless subshock which locally\nheats the plasma to a relativistic temperature, and the hot electrons emit\ncopious synchrotron photons inside the RMS. We find that this mechanism is\ngenerally effective for mildly relativistic shocks and may be the main source\nof photons observed in GRBs. We derive a simple analytical formula for the\ngenerated photon number per proton, $Z$, which gives $Z=10^5$-$10^6$,\nconsistent with observations. The photons are initially injected with low\nenergies, well below the observed GRB peak. Their number is controlled by two\nmain factors: (1) the abundance of electron-positron pairs created in the\nshock, which is self-consistently calculated, and (2) the upper limit on the\nbrightness temperature of soft radiation set by induced downscattering. The\ninjected soft photons that survive induced downscattering gain energy in the\nRMS via bulk Comptonization and shape its nonthermal spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 15:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

For example, these primitives can be used in data cleaning to identify\ndifferent representations of the same object. In many cases one can represent\nan object as a sparse 0-1 vector, or equivalently as the set of nonzero entries\nin such a vector. A set similarity join can then be used to identify those\npairs that have an exceptionally large dot product (or intersection, when\nviewed as sets). We choose to focus on identifying vectors with large Pearson\ncorrelation, but results extend to other similarity measures. In particular, we\nconsider the indexing problem of identifying correlated vectors in a set S of\nvectors sampled from {0,1}^d. Given a query vector y and a parameter alpha in\n(0,1), we need to search for an alpha-correlated vector x in a data structure\nrepresenting the vectors of S. This kind of similarity search has been\nintensely studied in worst-case (non-random data) settings.\n  Existing theoretically well-founded methods for set similarity search are\noften inferior to heuristics that take advantage of skew in the data\ndistribution, i.e., widely differing frequencies of 1s across the d dimensions.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to analyze the set similarity problem\nunder a random data model that reflects the kind of skewed data distributions\nseen in practice, allowing theoretical results much stronger than what is\npossible in worst-case settings. Our indexing data structure is a recursive,\ndata-dependent partitioning of vectors inspired by recent advances in set\nsimilarity search. Previous data-dependent methods do not seem to allow us to\nexploit skew in item frequencies, so we believe that our work sheds further\nlight on the power of data dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 15:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

The [C II] emission is completely dominated\nby the strong PDR emission from the nebula surrounding S1 expanding into the\ndense Oph A molecular cloud west and south of S1. The [C II] emission is\nsignificantly blue shifted relative to the CO spectra and also relative to the\nsystemic velocity, particularly in the northwestern part of the nebula. The [C\nII] lines are broader towards the center of the S1 nebula and narrower towards\nthe PDR shell. The [C II] lines are strongly self-absorbed over an extended\nregion in the S1 PDR. Based on the strength of the [13C II] F = 2-1 hyperfine\ncomponent, [C II] is significantly optically thick over most of the nebula. CO\nand 13CO(3-2) spectra are strongly self-absorbed, while C18O(3-2) is single\npeaked and centered in the middle of the self-absorption. We have used a simple\ntwo-layer LTE model to characterize the background and foreground cloud\ncontributing to the [C II] emission. From this analysis we estimate the\nextinction due to the foreground cloud to be ~9.9 mag, which is slightly less\nthan the reddening estimated towards S1.

Current state-of-the-art techniques\nare often limited by a compromise between resolution in the time and frequency\ndomain, mainly due to the use of elementary input signals that have not been\ndesigned for fast time-evolving systems such as materials undergoing gelation,\ncuring or self-healing. In this work, we develop an optimized and robust\nexcitation signal for time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy through the\nintroduction of joint frequency- and amplitude-modulated exponential chirps.\nInspired by the biosonar signals of bats and dolphins, we optimize the signal\nprofile to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio while minimizing spectral leakage\nwith a carefully-designed modulation of the envelope of the chirp. A combined\nexperimental and numerical investigation reveals that there exists an optimal\nrange of window profiles that minimizes the error with respect to standard\nsingle frequency sweep methods. The minimum error is set by the noise floor of\nthe instrument, suggesting that the accuracy of an optimally windowed chirp\nsignal is directly comparable to that achievable with a standard frequency\nsweep, while the acquisition time can be reduced by up to two orders of\nmagnitude, for comparable spectral content. Finally, we demonstrate the ability\nof this optimized signal to provide time- and frequency-resolved rheometric\ndata by studying the fast gelation process of an acid-induced protein gel. The\nuse of optimally windowed chirps enables a robust rheological characterization\nof a wide range of soft materials undergoing rapid mutation and has the\npotential to become an invaluable tool for researchers across different\ndisciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 15:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

This scenario is suitable for a\nstraight comparison of homologous pixels such as pixel-wise differencing.\nHowever, in some specific cases such as emergency situations, the only\navailable images may be those acquired through different kinds of sensors with\ndifferent resolutions. Recently some change detection techniques dealing with\nimages with different spatial and spectral resolutions, have been proposed.\nNevertheless, they are focused on a specific scenario where one image has a\nhigh spatial and low spectral resolution while the other has a low spatial and\nhigh spectral resolution. This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes\nbetween any two multi-band optical images disregarding their spatial and\nspectral resolution disparities. We propose a method that effectively uses the\navailable information by modeling the two observed images as spatially and\nspectrally degraded versions of two (unobserved) latent images characterized by\nthe same high spatial and high spectral resolutions. Covering the same scene,\nthe latent images are expected to be globally similar except for possible\nchanges in spatially sparse locations. Thus, the change detection task is\nenvisioned through a robust fusion task which enforces the differences between\nthe estimated latent images to be spatially sparse. We show that this robust\nfusion can be formulated as an inverse problem which is iteratively solved\nusing an alternate minimization strategy. The proposed framework is implemented\nfor an exhaustive list of applicative scenarios and applied to real multi-band\noptical images.

Information flow, and\nrelated causation inference, are tenant on this simple concept. We take the\nperspective of Weiner-Granger causality, descriptive of a subsystem forecast\nquality dependence on considering states of another subsystem. Here we develop\na new direct analytic discussion, rather than a data oriented approach.

A lightweight security solution\nis needed in MANET to balance its nodes resource tightness and mobility\nfeature. The role of CA should be decentralized in MANET because the network is\nmanaged by the nodes themselves without any fixed infrastructure and\ncentralized authority. In this paper, we created a distributed Public Key\nInfrastructure (PKI) using Shamir secret sharing mechanism which allows the\nnodes of the MANET to have a share of its private key. The traditional PKI\nprotocols require centralized authority and heavy computing power to manage\npublic and private keys, thus making them not suitable for MANETs. To establish\na secure communication for the MANET nodes, we proposed a lightweight crypto\nprotocol which requires limited resources, making it suitable for MANETs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 12:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

As carried out by a dynamical system, it\nis the process by which the system absorbs information into its state. A\ncomplex network of agents cognizes knowledge about its environment, internal\ndynamics and initial state by forming emergent, macro-level patterns. Such\npatterns require each agent to find its place while partially aware of the\nwhole pattern. Such partial awareness can be achieved by separating the system\ndynamics into two parts by timescale: the propagation dynamics and the pattern\ndynamics. The fast propagation dynamics describe the spread of signals across\nthe network. If they converge to a fixed point for any quasi-static state of\nthe slow pattern dynamics, that fixed point represents an aggregate of\nmacro-level information. On longer timescales, agents coordinate via positive\nfeedback to form patterns, which are defined using closed walks in the graph of\nagents. Patterns can be coherent, in that every part of the pattern depends on\nevery other part for context. Coherent patterns are acausal, in that (a) they\ncannot be predicted and (b) no part of the stored knowledge can be mapped to\nany part of the pattern, or vice versa. A cognitive network's knowledge is\nencoded or embodied by the selection of patterns which emerge. The theory of\ncognition summarized here can model autocatalytic reaction-diffusion systems,\nartificial neural networks, market economies and ant colony optimization, among\nmany other real and virtual systems. This theory suggests a new understanding\nof complexity as a lattice of contexts rather than a single measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 04:12:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 14:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

In the\npresent work, the interaction between cutting grain and workpiece material in\ngrinding process is analyzed. Single diamonds are considered for machining,\nwhich operates in comparison to other measurements in the range of grinding\nspeed. The highest temperature in the grain-material interaction and cutting\nforces are measured. In order to measure the flash temperature, an innovative\nmethod to measure and analyze the temperature through the diamond grain in the\ncutting zone by a two-color pyrometer is proposed. Furthermore, cutting forces\nare measured simultaneously. In order to measure the temperature in the cutting\nzone, an accurate connection between diamond and pyrometer fiber is required.\nThus, the diamond tool holders are manufactured by electrical discharge\nmachining (EDM) milling in deionized water. A 0.5-mm-diameter hole is drilled\nin each holder to connect the diamond precisely to the pyrometer fiber.\nMachining processes are performed with 30 {\\mu}m depth of cut, cutting length\nof 20 mm, and cutting speed of 65 m/s on Ti6Al4V. The cutting tool is fixed,\nand the shape of the rotating workpiece is optimized. The diamond holder with\nthe specific shape is designed and manufactured. Quasi-static, dynamic, modal,\nand harmonic response analyses are performed in order to reduce vibrations and\nchattering. The measured flash temperature is 1380 {\\deg}C and cutting normal,\ntangential, and axial forces are measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 15:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}
