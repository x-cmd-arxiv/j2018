We seek to understand the\nrelationship of hot Jupiter radii with stellar irradiation and mass. We also\naim to find the intrinsic physical scatter in their radii caused by\nunobservable parameters. By constructing a hierarchical Bayesian model, we\ninfer the probabilistic relation between planet radius, mass and incident flux\nfor a sample of 286 gas giants.

At\nhigher masses, the radius response to incident flux begins to decrease. Below a\nthreshold of 0.37 +- 0.03 MJ we find that giant exoplanets as a population are\nunable to maintain inflated radii greater than 1.4 RJ but instead exhibit\nsmaller sizes as the incident flux is increased beyond 10^6 Wm-2.

It would be advantageous if computationally simpler models\ncould provide some preliminary information on these disks. Here we apply a\nparticle-only model (that we developed for gas-poor debris disks) to the\ngas-rich disk, HL Tauri, to address the question of whether such simple models\ncan inform the study of these systems. Assuming three potentially embedded\nplanets, we match HL Tau's radial profile fairly well and derive best-fit\nplanetary masses and orbital radii (0.40, 0.02, 0.21 Jupiter masses for the\nplanets orbiting a 0.55 solar-mass star at 11.22, 29.67, 64.23 AU).

In\nthis paper, we tackle the challenge of creating one of the biggest dataset for\nlearning affordances. We use seven sitcoms to extract a diverse set of scenes\nand how actors interact with different objects in the scenes. Our dataset\nconsists of more than 10K scenes and 28K ways humans can interact with these\n10K images. We also propose a two-step approach to predict affordances in a new\nscene. In the first step, given a location in the scene we classify which of\nthe 30 pose classes is the likely affordance pose. Given the pose class and the\nscene, we then use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to extract the scale and\ndeformation of the pose. The VAE allows us to sample the distribution of\npossible poses at test time.

In most surface flux transport\n(SFT) and BL dynamo models, the dispersal and migration of surface fields is\nmodeled as an effective turbulent diffusion. Recent SFT models have\nincorporated explicit, realistic convective flows in order to improve the\nfidelity of convective transport but, to our knowledge, this has not yet been\nimplemented in previous BL models. Since most Flux-Transport (FT)/BL models are\naxisymmetric, they do not have the capacity to include such flows. We present\nthe first kinematic 3D FT/BL model to explicitly incorporate realistic\nconvective flows based on solar observations. Though we describe a means to\ngeneralize these flows to 3D, we find that the kinematic small-scale dynamo\naction they produce disrupts the operation of the cyclic dynamo. Cyclic\nsolution is found by limiting the convective flow to act only on the vertical\nradial component of the magnetic field. The results obtained are generally in\ngood agreement with the observed surface flux evolution and with non-convective\nmodels that have a turbulent diffusivity on the order of $3 \\times 10^{12}$\ncm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ (300 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$). However, we find that the use of a\nturbulent diffusivity underestimates the dynamo efficiency, producing weaker\nmean fields and shorter cycle than in the convective models. Also, the\nconvective models exhibit mixed polarity bands in the polar regions that have\nno counterpart in solar observations. Also, the explicitly computed turbulent\nelectromotive force (emf) bears little resemblance to a diffusive flux. We also\nfind that the poleward migration speed of poloidal flux is determined mainly by\nthe meridional flow and the vertical diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 16:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

In\naddition to the target Tweet, we collect and analyze the user's historical\nposts to model intra-user Tweet representations. To suppress the noise in a\nsingle Tweet, we also model the similar Tweets posted by all other users with\nreinforced inter-user representation learning techniques. Experimentally, we\nshow that leveraging these two representations can significantly improve the\nf-score of a strong bidirectional LSTM baseline model by 10.1%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 17:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 02:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

It also has a significant influence on estimates of\nstellar properties for exoplanet hosts, on stellar population synthesis, and on\nthe detailed modeling of interior stellar structures, including the calculation\nof oscillation frequencies that are observable with asteroseismic techniques.\nWe find that the derived f(ov) values for our new sample are consistent with\nthe trend defined by our earlier determinations, and strengthen the relation.\nThis provides an opportunity for future series of models to test the new\nprescription, grounded on observations, against independent observations that\nmay constrain overshooting in a different way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

The respective value of reduced electric field E/n varies\nin the range of 50-6000kTd, with reduced density nd (where n is the gas density\nand d is the inter-electrode distance) on the order of 10^20 m^-2. For fast\nneutral atoms produced via charge exchange, the following interactions prove\nessential to understanding the breakdown mechanism: contribution to impact\nionization, strongly anisotropic scattering in collisions with background\natoms,and backscattering (of both atoms and ions, which become neutralized)\nfrom the cathode. Three regimes of the breakdown have been identified according\nto relative share of impact ionization by electrons, by ions, and by fast\nneutrals.

We demonstrate that interactions smear out the edge states\nby introducing a finite life time of quasiparticles. Even though a general\nmethod for calculating the topological invariant of a nonequilibrium steady\nstate is lacking, we extract the topological invariant using a Laughlin charge\npump set-up. We find and attribute to the dissipations into the bath connected\nto every lattice site, which is intrinsic to real-space Floquet DMFT methods,\nthat the pumped charge is not an integer even for the non-interacting case at\nvery low reservoir temperatures. Furthermore, using the rate equation based on\nthe Floquet-Born-Markov approximation, we calculate the charge pump from the\nrate equations for the non-interacting case to identify the role of the\nspectral properties of the bath. Starting from this approach we propose an\nexperimental protocol for measuring quantized charge pumping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 19:40:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 08:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

The properties may be conditional\nindependences or also quantitative statements about dependences.\n  More generally, we define a learning scenario where the input is a subset of\nvariables and the label is some statistical property of that subset. Sets of\njointly observed variables define the training points, while unobserved sets\nare possible test points. To solve this learning task, we infer, as an\nintermediate step, a causal model from the observations that then entails\nproperties of unobserved sets. Accordingly, we can define the VC dimension of a\nclass of causal models and derive generalization bounds for the predictions.\n  Here, causal inference becomes more modest and better accessible to empirical\ntests than usual: rather than trying to find a causal hypothesis that is 'true'\n(which is a problematic term when it is unclear how to define interventions) a\ncausal hypothesis is useful whenever it correctly predicts statistical\nproperties of unobserved joint distributions.\n  Within such a 'pragmatic' application of causal inference, some popular\nheuristic approaches become justified in retrospect.

Reachability analysis for DAE systems is more complex\nthan ODE systems, especially for high-index DAEs because they contain both a\ndifferential part (i.e., ODE) and algebraic constraints (AC). In this paper, we\nextend the recent scalable simulation-based reachability analysis in\ncombination with decoupling techniques for a class of high-index large linear\nDAEs. In particular, a high-index linear DAE is first decoupled into one ODE\nand one or several AC subsystems based on the well-known Marz decoupling method\nultilizing admissible projectors.

Since generic gravitational wave signals have\nfrequency content that evolves in time, a collection of chirplets provides a\nmore compact representation of the signal, resulting in more accurate waveform\nreconstructions, especially for low signal-to-noise events, and events that\noccupy a large time-frequency volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 21:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Mode\ncoupling of tidal deformation with the disc eccentricity is known to produce\nexponentially growing eccentricities at certain mean-motion resonances.\nHowever, the details of an efficient saturation mechanism balancing this growth\nstill are not fully understood. This paper develops a local numerical model for\nan eccentric quasi-axisymmetric shearing box which generalises the often-used\ncartesian shearing box model. The numerical method is an overall second order\nwell-balanced finite volume method which maintains the stratified and\noscillatory steady-state solution by construction. This implementation is\nemployed to study the non-linear outcome of the parametric instability in\neccentric discs with vertical structure. Stratification is found to constrain\nthe perturbation energy near the mid-plane and localise the effective region of\ninertial wave breaking that sources turbulence. A saturated marginally sonic\nturbulent state results from the non-linear breaking of inertial waves and is\nsubsequently unstable to large-scale axisymmetric zonal flow structures. This\nresulting limit-cycle behaviour reduces access to the eccentric energy source\nand prevents substantial transport of angular momentum radially through the\ndisc. Still, the saturation of this parametric instability of inertial waves is\nshown to damp eccentricity on a time-scale of a thousand orbital periods. It\nmay thus be a promising mechanism for intermittently regaining balance with the\nexponential growth of eccentricity from the eccentric Lindblad resonances and\nmay also help explain the occurrence of \"bursty\" dynamics such as the superhump\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 21:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

Information dynamics is a quantitative methodology for\nmodelling the intrinsic information processing conducted by a process\nrepresented as a time series, but to date has only been formulated in discrete\ntime. Building on previous work which demonstrated how to formulate transfer\nentropy in continuous time, we give a total account of information processing\nin this setting, incorporating information storage. We find that a convergent\nrate of predictive capacity, comprised of the transfer entropy and active\ninformation storage, does not exist, arising through divergent rates of active\ninformation storage. We identify that active information storage can be\ndecomposed into two separate quantities that characterise predictive capacity\nstored in a process: active memory utilisation and instantaneous predictive\ncapacity. The latter involves prediction related to path regularity and so\nsolely inherits the divergent properties of the active information storage,\nwhilst the former permits definitions of pathwise and rate quantities. We\nformulate measures of memory utilisation for jump and neural spiking processes\nand illustrate measures of information processing in synthetic neural spiking\nmodels and coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. The application to synthetic\nneural spiking models demonstrates that active memory utilisation for point\nprocesses consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at spikes) interrupting\na continuously varying contribution (relating to waiting times between spikes),\ncomplementing the behaviour previously demonstrated for transfer entropy in\nthese processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 23:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

In this work, we\ndemonstrate a new mechanism for the formation of quantum droplet in\nheteronuclear atomic systems, i.e., by applying the synthetic spin-orbit\ncoupling(SOC). Take the Bose-Fermi mixture for example, we show that by\nimposing a Rashba SOC between the spin states of fermions, the greatly\nsuppressed Fermi pressure can enable the formation of Bose-Fermi droplets even\nfor very weak boson-fermion attractions, which are insufficient to bound a\ndroplet if without SOC. In such SOC-induced quantum droplets, the boson/fermion\ndensity ratio universally depends on the SOC strength, and they occur in the\nmean-field collapsing regime but with a negative fluctuation energy, distinct\nfrom the interaction-induced droplets found in literature. The accessibility of\nthese Bose-Fermi droplets in ultracold Cs-Li and Rb-K mixtures is also\ndiscussed. Our results shed light on the droplet formation in a vast class of\nheteronuclear atomic systems through the manipulation of single-particle\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

However, due to its limited\ncapacity, the wireless network may not be able to meet the delay requirements\nof such 360 content transmissions. To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs\ncan extract specific visible content (e.g., user field of view) from the\noriginal 360 data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce\nthe traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. To further alleviate the\nUAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that\nusers request. This joint content caching and transmission problem is\nformulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users'\nreliability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of\neach user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem,\na distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network\nideas from liquid state machine (LSM) and echo state networks (ESNs) is\nproposed. The proposed algorithm enables each SBS to predict the users'\nreliability so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content\ntransmission format for each UAV. Analytical results are derived to expose the\nvarious network factors that impact content caching and content transmission\nformat selection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields\n25.4% gain of reliability compared to Q-learning. The results also show that\nthe proposed algorithm can achieve 14.7% gain of reliability due to the\nreduction of traffic load over backhaul compared to the proposed algorithm with\nrandom caching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

An unsolved question is\nthe effect of different, especially higher, ion beam fluences on ion stopping\nin solid targets. This is relevant in applications such as in fusion sciences.\nTo address this question, a Thomson parabola was built for the Neutralized\nDrift Compression eXperiment (NDCX-II) for ion energy-loss measurements at\ndifferent ion beam fluences. The linear induction accelerator NDCX-II delivers\n2 ns short, intense ion pulses, up to several tens of nC/pulse, or\n10$^{10}$-10$^{11}$ ions, with a peak kinetic energy of ~1.1 MeV and a minimal\nspot size of 2 mm FWHM. For this particular accelerator the energy\ndetermination with conventional beam diagnostics, for example, time of flight\nmeasurements, is imprecise due to the non-trivial longitudinal phase space of\nthe beam. In contrast, a Thomson parabola is well suited to reliably determine\nthe beam energy distribution. The Thomson parabola differentiates charged\nparticles by energy and charge-to-mass ratio, through deflection of charged\nparticles by electric and magnetic fields. During first proof-of-principle\nexperiments, we achieved to reproduce the average initial helium beam energy as\npredicted by computer simulations with a deviation of only 1.4 %.

A nonhalting abelian network can be\nrealized as a discrete dynamical system in many different ways, depending on\nthe update order. We show that certain features of the dynamics, such as\nminimal period length, have intrinsic definitions that do not require\nspecifying an update order.\n  We give an intrinsic definition of the \\emph{torsion group} of a finite\nirreducible (halting or nonhalting) abelian network, and show that it coincides\nwith the critical group of Bond and Levine (2016) if the network is halting. We\nshow that the torsion group acts freely on the set of invertible recurrent\ncomponents of the trajectory digraph, and identify when this action is\ntransitive.\n  This perspective leads to new results even in the classical case of sinkless\nrotor networks (deterministic analogues of random walks). In Holroyd et. al\n(2008) it was shown that the recurrent configurations of a sinkless rotor\nnetwork with just one chip are precisely the unicycles (spanning subgraphs with\na unique oriented cycle, with the chip on the cycle). We generalize this result\nto abelian mobile agent networks with any number of chips. We give formulas for\ngenerating series such as \\[ \\sum_{n \\geq 1} r_n z^n = \\det (\\frac{1}{1-z}D - A\n) \\] where $r_n$ is the number of recurrent chip-and-rotor configurations with\n$n$ chips; $D$ is the diagonal matrix of outdegrees, and $A$ is the adjacency\nmatrix.

The performance of TD methods often depends on well\nchosen step-sizes, yet few algorithms have been developed for setting the\nstep-size automatically for TD learning. An important limitation of current\nmethods is that they adapt a single step-size shared by all the weights of the\nlearning system. A vector step-size enables greater optimization by specifying\nparameters on a per-feature basis. Furthermore, adapting parameters at\ndifferent rates has the added benefit of being a simple form of representation\nlearning.

Detailed analyses suggest that the width of point spread\nfunction has a significant effect on the measured ICL fraction, while the\nrelatively small pixel size shows almost no influence.

Reconciling the strong spherical shell effects at\n${Z=50}$ with the different ${Z}$ values of fission fragments observed in\nnature has been a longstanding puzzle.

However,\nthe weak measurements may require almost arbitrary unitaries, which are\nunlikely to be realized by any real measurement device. Furthermore, many\nmeasurement processes are destructive, like photon counting procedures that\nterminate once all photons are consumed. One cannot expect to have full control\nof the evolution of a state under such destructive measurements, and the\npossible unitaries allow only a limited set of weak measurements. In this\npaper, we consider a qubit model of destructive weak measurements, which is a\ntoy version of an optical cavity, in which the state of an electromagnetic\nfield mode inside the cavity leaks out and is measured destructively while the\nvacuum state |0> leaks in to the cavity. At long times, the state of the qubit\ninevitably evolves to be |0>, and the only available control is the choice of\nmeasurement on the external ancilla system. Surprisingly, this very limited\nmodel can still perform an arbitrary projective measurement on the qubit in any\nbasis, where the probability of getting an outcome satisfies the usual Born\nrule. Combining this method with probabilistic post processing, the result can\nbe extended to any generalized measurement with commuting POVM elements. This\nimplies, among other results, that any two-outcome POVM on a qubit can be\ndecomposed into a sequence of destructive weak measurements by this restricted\nmeasurement device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 06:23:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

We present here such a comparison using the two main\napproaches to calculate the required atomic data, the $R$-Matrix and\ndistorted-wave methods, as well as sets of configurations and coupling schemes\nto quantify the effects on the opacities for the $Fe\\ XVII$ and $Ni\\ XIV$ ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 06:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

The system dynamics is\nestablished in the spherical coordinate frame using a state-space model. The\nobservability analysis of the state-space model shows that the system is\nunobservable when the sound source is placed with elevation angles of $90$ and\n$0$ degree. The proposed method utilizes the difference between the azimuth\nestimates resulting from respectively the 3D and the two-dimensional models to\ncheck the zero-degree-elevation condition and further estimates the elevation\nangle using a polynomial curve fitting approach. Also, the proposed method is\ncapable of detecting a $90$-degree elevation by extracting the zero-ITD signal\n'buried' in noise. Additionally, a distance localization is performed by first\nrotating the microphone array to face toward the sound source and then shifting\nthe microphone perpendicular to the source-robot vector by a predefined\ndistance of a fixed number of steps. The integrated rotational and\ntranslational motions of the microphone array provide a complete orientation\nand distance localization using only the ITD cue.

Previous prevention methods are mainly based on software\nchecking associated with performance overhead, while traditional hardware\nprotection mechanisms only work for inter-process memory accesses. In this\npaper we propose a novel hardware based in-process isolation system called PULP\n(Protection by User Level Partition). PULP modifies processor core by\nassociating program counter and virtual memory address to achieve in-process\ndata isolation. PULP partitions the program into two distinct parts, one is\nreliable, called primary functions, and the other is unreliable, called\nsecondary functions, the accessible memory range of which can be configured via\nAPIs. PULP automatically checks the memory bound when executing load/store\noperations in secondary functions. A RISC-V based FPGA prototype is\nimplementated and functional test shows that PULP can effectively prevent\nin-process bug, including the Heartbleed and other buffer overflow\nvulnerabilities, etc. The total runtime overhead of PULP is negligible, as\nthere is no extra runtime overhead besides configuring the API. We run SPEC2006\nto evaluate the average performance, considering the LIBC functions as\nsecondary functions. Experimental timing results show that, running bzip2, mcf,\nand libquantum, PULP bears low runtime overhead (less than 0.1%).

We exploit the observation that the object pose of a known object is\npredictive for the appearance in any known view. That is, given only the pose\nand shape parameters of a hand, the hand's appearance from any viewpoint can be\napproximated. To exploit this observation, we train a model that -- given input\nfrom one view -- estimates a latent representation, which is trained to be\npredictive for the appearance of the object when captured from another\nviewpoint.

As a case study, we consider nanotube (6, 5), for which we\ncalculate the two-phonon spectrum. We investigate in detail the 2D band and\nidentify three contributions to it: a non-dispersive one and two dispersive\nones, which are found to depend on the electron and phonon dispersion of the\nnanotube, and on the laser excitation. We also predict two-phonon bands, which\nare not allowed in the parent structure graphene. The obtained two-phonon bands\nare in very good agreement with the available experimental data. The\nsymmetry-adapted formalism makes feasible the calculation of the two-phonon\nRaman bands of any observable nanotube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 08:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 19:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

To perform such measurements the luminosity and cosmological redshift\n($z$) of the SNe Ia have to be determined. The uncertainty on $z$ includes an\nunknown peculiar velocity, which can be very large for SNe Ia in the virialized\ncores of massive clusters. We determine which SNe Ia exploded in galaxy\nclusters. We then study how the correction for peculiar velocities of host\ngalaxies inside the clusters improves the Hubble residuals. Using 145 SNe Ia\nfrom the Nearby Supernova Factory we found 11 candidates for membership in\nclusters. To estimate the redshift of a cluster we applied the bi-weight\ntechnique. Then, we use the galaxy cluster redshift instead of the host galaxy\nredshift to construct the Hubble diagram. For SNe Ia inside galaxy clusters the\ndispersion around the Hubble diagram when peculiar velocities are taken into\naccount is smaller in comparison with a case without peculiar velocity\ncorrection, with a $wRMS=0.130\\pm0.038$ mag instead of $wRMS=0.137\\pm0.036$\nmag. The significance of this improvement is 3.58 $\\sigma$. If we remove the\nvery nearby Virgo cluster member SN2006X ($z<0.01$) from the analysis, the\nsignificance decreases to 1.34 $\\sigma$. The peculiar velocity correction is\nfound to be highest for the SNe Ia hosted by blue spiral galaxies, with high\nlocal specific star formation rate and smaller stellar mass, seemingly counter\nto what might be expected given the heavy concentration of old, massive\nelliptical galaxies in clusters. As expected, the Hubble residuals of SNe Ia\nassociated with massive galaxy clusters improve when the cluster redshift is\ntaken as the cosmological redshift of the SN. This fact has to be taken into\naccount in future cosmological analyses in order to achieve higher accuracy for\ncosmological redshift measurements.

Thanks to RXTE, we discovered that neutron\nstars in LMXBs spins at 200-750 Hz frequencies, and indirectly confirmed the\nrecycling scenario, according to which neutron stars are spun up to ms periods\nduring the LMXB-phase. In the meantime, the continuous discovery of\nrotation-powered MSPs in binary systems in the radio and gamma-ray band (mainly\nwith the Fermi LAT) allowed us to classify these sources into two \"spiders\"\npopulations, depending on the mass of their companion stars: Black Widow, with\nvery low-mass companion stars, and Redbacks, with larger companions possibly\nfilling their Roche lobes but without accretion. It was soon regained that MSPs\nin short orbital period LMXBs are the progenitors of the spider populations of\nrotation-powered MSPs, although a direct link between accretion- and\nrotation-powered MSPs was still missing. In 2013 XMM-Newton spotted the X-ray\noutburst of a new accreting MSP (IGR J18245-2452) in a source that was\npreviously classified as a radio MSP. Follow up observations of the source when\nit went back to X-ray quiescence showed that it was able to swing between\naccretion- to rotation-powered pulsations in a relatively short timescale (few\ndays), promoting this source as the direct link between the LMXB and the radio\nMSP phases. Following discoveries showed that there exists a bunch of sources,\nwhich alternates X-ray activity phases, showing X-ray pulsations, to radio-loud\nphases, showing radio pulsations, establishing a new class of MSPs: the\nTransitional MSP. In this review we describe these exciting discoveries and the\nproperties of accreting and transitional MSPs, highlighting what we know and\nwhat we have still to learn about in order to fully understand the (sometime\npuzzling) behavior of these systems and their evolutive connection (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 09:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

First, the expressive power of hierarchical\nRNN decoders is often high enough to model the data using only its decoding\ndistributions without relying on the latent variables. Second, the conditional\nVAE structure whose generation process is conditioned on a context, makes the\nrange of training targets very sparse; that is, the RNN decoders can easily\noverfit to the training data ignoring the latent variables. To solve the\ndegeneration problem, we propose a novel model named Variational Hierarchical\nConversation RNNs (VHCR), involving two key ideas of (1) using a hierarchical\nstructure of latent variables, and (2) exploiting an utterance drop\nregularization.

We study the combination of these criteria for parity\nconditions, e.g., there are two parity conditions one of which must be won\nsurely, and the other almost-surely. The problem has been studied recently by\nBerthon et.~al for MDPs with combination of sure and almost-sure winning, under\ninfinite-memory strategies, and the problem has been established to be in NP\n$\\cap$ coNP. Even in MDPs there is a difference between finite-memory and\ninfinite-memory strategies. Our main results for combination of sure and\nalmost-sure winning are as follows: (a)~we show that for MDPs with\nfinite-memory strategies the problem lie in NP $\\cap$ coNP; (b)~we show that\nfor turn-based stochastic games the problem is coNP-complete, both for\nfinite-memory and infinite-memory strategies; and (c)~we present algorithmic\nresults for the finite-memory case, both for MDPs and turn-based stochastic\ngames, by reduction to non-stochastic parity games.

To reduce this deficiency, we\nanalyze different mountain ranges by means of a network approach and grasp some\nessential features of the ridge branching structure. We also employ a fractal\nanalysis as it is especially suitable for describing properties of rough\nobjects and surfaces. As our approach differs from typical analyses that are\ncarried out in geophysics, we believe that it can initialize a research\ndirection that will allow to shed more light on the processes that are\nresponsible for landscape formation and will contribute to the network theory\nby indicating a need for the construction of new models of the network growth\nas no existing model can properly describe the ridge formation. We also believe\nthat certain features of our study can offer help in the cartographic\ngeneralization. Specifically, we study structure of the ridge networks based on\nthe empirical elevation data collected by SRTM. We consider mountain ranges\nfrom different geological periods and geographical locations. For each mountain\nrange, we construct a simple topographic network representation (the ridge\njunctions are nodes) and a ridge representation (the ridges are nodes and the\njunctions are edges) and calculate the parameters characterizing their\ntopology. We observe that the topographic networks inherit the fractal\nstructure of the mountain ranges but do not show any other complex features. In\ncontrast, the ridge networks, while lacking the proper fractality, reveal the\npower-law degree distributions with the exponent $1.6\\le \\beta \\le 1.7$. By\ntaking into account the fact that the analyzed mountains differ in many\nproperties, these values seem to be universal for the earthly mountainous\nterrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 11:19:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 13:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 13:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

One of\nthe characteristic properties of HEAs was believed to be so-called \"sluggish\"\ndiffusion. The faith on this myth instead of rigorous experimental analysis\nplayed such a dominant role that the first set of data on interdiffusion, in\nfact based on an improper analysis, were cited in hundreds of articles to state\nthe presence of sluggishness of diffusion rates in high entropy alloys. In this\nreview, the recent data on atomic diffusion in HEAs are critically discussed.\nThe discussion is focused on tracer diffusion which is already measured\ndominantly for polycrystalline, but in some cases for single crystalline\nhigh-entropy alloys. Alternatively, a rigorous analysis of the interdiffuson\nexperiments, which provide the diffusion rates of chemical species, too,\nbecomes more and more sophisticated for three and more elements in an alloy and\nit is challenging to derive physically sound quantities from a general\nmulticomponent diffusion experiment. Most promising in this case is the\ndiffusion couple technique, especially the so-called pseudo-binary approach.\nThis approach is analyzed with a focus on the applicability and the possible\nerrors induced if up-hill diffusion appears. It is shown that atomic diffusion\nin HEAs cannot a priori be considered as sluggish and both atomic interactions\nas well as correlation effects are responsible for the observed trends. Even if\nestimated on the same homologous scale, the diffusion retardation induced by a\n\"high entropy\" in FCC crystals is not simply proportional to the number of\nalloying components and it is shown to be similar to that induced by the L12\nordering in a binary system. Furthermore, the importance of cross-correlations\nin diffusion of different species in HEAs is highlighted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 11:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

A widely established technique is the Widom insertion method, that\ncomputes the chemical potential by sampling the energy of insertion of a test\nparticle. Non-homogeneity is accounted for by assigning a density dependent\nweight to the insertion points. However, in dense systems, the poor sampling of\nthe insertion energy is a source of inefficiency, hampering a reliable\nconvergence.\n  We have recently presented a new technique for the chemical potential\ncalculation in homogeneous fluids.

This has typically been partially tackled by the use of\nstacking. However, stacking only provides the average properties of the objects\nin the stack. This work aims to trace the MS over $0.2\\leq z<6.0$ using the\nlatest de-blended Herschel photometry, which reaches $\\approx10$ times deeper\nthan the 5$\\sigma$ confusion limit in SPIRE. This provides more reliable star\nformation rates (SFRs), especially for the fainter galaxies, and hence a more\nreliable MS. We built a pipeline that uses the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) modelling and fitting tool CIGALE to generate flux density priors in the\nHerschel SPIRE bands. These priors were then fed into the de-blending tool XID+\nto extract flux densities from the SPIRE maps. Multi-wavelength data were\ncombined with the extracted SPIRE flux densities to constrain SEDs and provide\nstellar mass (M$_{\\star}$) and SFRs. These M$_{\\star}$ and SFRs were then used\nto populate the SFR-M$_{\\star}$ plane over $0.2\\leq z<6.0$. No significant\nevidence of a high-mass turn-over was found; the best fit is thus a simple\ntwo-parameter power law of the form\nlog(SFR)$=\\alpha[$log(M$_{\\star})-10.5]+\\beta$. The normalisation of the power\nlaw increases with redshift, rapidly at $z\\lesssim1.8$, from $0.58\\pm0.09$ at\n$z\\approx0.37$ to $1.31\\pm0.08$ at $z\\approx1.8$. The slope is also found to\nincrease with redshift, perhaps with an excess around $1.8\\leq z<2.9$. The\nincreasing slope indicates that galaxies become more self-similar as redshift\nincreases, implying that the specific SFR of high-mass galaxies increases over\n$z=0.2$ to $z=6.0$, becoming closer to that of low-mass galaxies. The excess in\nthe slope at $1.8\\leq z<2.9$, if present, coincides with the peak of the cosmic\nstar formation history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 09:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

If\nthe underlying monoidal category is cartesian monoidal, a bimonoidal structure\nis given uniquely by a commutative strength.

The system consists of fluid ions\nand electrons as well as arbitrary numbers of species whose dynamics is\ngoverned by the Vlasov equation. The proposed model is thus a generalized\nversion of the well-known standard hybrid plasma simulation model, in which the\nions are fully kinetic whereas the electrons are assumed to be a fluid. Since\nthe proposed model employs the exact form of the generalized Ohm's law, the\nmass and energy densities, as well as the charge-to-mass ratio of the kinetic\nspecies, are taken to be arbitrary. In the absence of the kinetic species, it\nreduces to the quasi-neutral two-fluid model (Amano, 2015, JCP). In the\nopposite situation where the mass and energy densities of the kinetic species\nare much larger than the fluid ions, it is nothing more than the standard\nhybrid model with finite electron inertia effect. If the kinetic species is an\nenergetic particle (EP) population having negligible mass density but\nsubstantial energy density and the scale size is much larger than the ion and\nelectron inertial lengths, it describes the self-consistent coupling between\nthe magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the EP dynamics. The\nenergetic-particle-magnetohydrodynamics (EP-MHD) hybrid model is thus a special\ncase of the more general model described in this paper. Advantages of this\napproach over the existing models are discussed. A three-dimensional simulation\ncode solving the proposed set of equations is described. The code combines the\nParticle-in-Cell scheme for solving the kinetic species and a\nRiemann-solver-based code for the two-fluid equations. Several benchmark\nsimulation results are shown to confirm that the code successfully captures the\ndynamics of the EP population interacting self-consistently with the MHD fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 15:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The time to learn intervention policies\nis limited as disengagement from the user can occur quickly. Also, in e-Health\nintervention timing can be crucial before the optimal window passes. We present\nan approach that learns tailored personalization policies for groups of users\nby combining RL and clustering. The benefits are two-fold: speeding up the\nlearning to prevent disengagement while maintaining a high level of\npersonalization. Our clustering approach utilizes dynamic time warping to\ncompare user trajectories consisting of states and rewards. We apply online and\nbatch RL to learn policies over clusters of individuals and introduce our\nself-developed and publicly available simulator for e-Health interventions to\nevaluate our approach. We compare our methods with an e-Health intervention\nbenchmark. We demonstrate that batch learning outperforms online learning for\nour setting. Furthermore, our proposed clustering approach for RL finds\nnear-optimal clusterings which lead to significantly better policies in terms\nof cumulative reward compared to learning a policy per individual or learning\none non-personalized policy across all individuals. Our findings also indicate\nthat the learned policies accurately learn to send interventions at the right\nmoments and that the users workout more and at the right times of the day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 15:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 21:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 05:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

One\nof their core operations is automatic modulation recognition (AMR). Existing\nresearch focuses on coherent modulation schemes such as QAM, PSK and FSK. The\nAMR of (non-coherent) space-time modulation remains an uncharted area despite\nits wide deployment in modern multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems.\nThe scheme using a so called Grassmann constellation enables rate-enhancement\nusing multi-antennas and blind detection. In this work, we propose an AMR\napproach for Grassmann constellation based on data clustering, which differs\nfrom traditional AMR based on classification using a modulation database. The\napproach allows algorithms for clustering on the Grassmann manifold, such as\nGrassmann K-means and depth-first search, originally developed for computer\nvision to be applied to AMR. We further develop an analytical framework for\nstudying and designing these algorithms in the context of AMR. First, the\nmaximum-likelihood Grassmann constellation detection is proved to be equivalent\nto clustering on the Grassmannian. Thereby, a well-known machine-learning\nresult that was originally established only for the Euclidean space is\nrediscovered for the Grassmannian. Next, despite a rich literature on\nalgorithmic design, theoretical analysis of data clustering is largely\noverlooked due to the lack of tractable techniques. We tackle the challenge by\nintroducing probabilistic metrics for measuring the inter-cluster separability\nand intra-cluster connectivity of received space-time symbols and deriving them\nusing tools from differential geometry and Grassmannian packing. The results\nprovide useful insights into the effects of various parameters ranging from the\nsignal-to-noise ratio to constellation size, facilitating algorithmic design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 15:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 15:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Compared with those proposal-based ones, real-time detectors are in\nfar more serious trouble since they renounce the use of region-proposing stage\nwhich is used to filter a majority of backgrounds for achieving real-time\nrates. Though foregrounds as hard examples are in urgent need of being mined\nfrom tons of backgrounds, a considerable number of state-of-the-art real-time\ndetectors, like YOLO series, have yet to profit from existing hard example\nmining methods, as using these methods need detectors fit series of\nprerequisites. In this paper, we propose a general hard example mining method\nnamed Loss Rank Mining (LRM) to fill the gap. LRM is a general method for\nreal-time detectors, as it utilizes the final feature map which exists in all\nreal-time detectors to mine hard examples. By using LRM, some elements\nrepresenting easy examples in final feature map are filtered and detectors are\nforced to concentrate on hard examples during training. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method. With our method, the improvements of\nYOLOv2 detector on auto-driving related dataset KITTI and more general dataset\nPASCAL VOC are over 5% and 2% mAP, respectively. In addition, LRM is the first\nhard example mining strategy which could fit YOLOv2 perfectly and make it\nbetter applied in series of real scenarios where both real-time rates and\naccurate detection are strongly demanded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-13"}

Our proposal concerns a variation of Petri nets\nwhere tokens are persistent and are distinguished from each other by an\nidentity which allows for transitions to be reversed spontaneously in or out of\ncausal order.
