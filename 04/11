For our experiments we prepared thin films of Fe and Dy and\nmultilayers of Fe/Dy by ultra-high vacuum sputtering. The magnetic properties\nof each material were determined with a superconducting quantum interference\ndevice. Furthermore, we performed magnetoresistance measurements with similarly\ngrown, microstructured devices, where the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)\neffect was used to identify the magnetization state of the samples. By\nanalyzing and comparing the corresponding data of Fe and Dy, we show that the\npresence of a Dy layer on top of the Fe layer significantly influences its\nmagnetic properties and makes it magnetically harder. We perform a systematic\nevaluation of this effect and its dependence on temperature and on the\nthickness of the soft magnetic layer. All experimental results can consistently\nbe explained with exchange coupling at the interface between the Fe and the Dy\nlayer. Our experiments also yield a negative sign of the AMR effect of thin Dy\nfilms, and an increase of the Dy films' Curie temperature, which is due to\ngrowth conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 16:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

The majority of current\nresearches fix the number of driving intentions by considering only a specific\nscenario. However, distinct driving environments usually contain various\npossible driving maneuvers. Therefore, a intention prediction method that can\nadapt to different traffic scenarios is needed. To further improve the overall\nvehicle prediction performance, motion information is usually incorporated with\nclassified intentions. As suggested in some literature, the methods that\ndirectly predict possible goal locations can achieve better performance for\nlong-term motion prediction than other approaches due to their automatic\nincorporation of environment constraints. Moreover, by obtaining the temporal\ninformation of the predicted destinations, the optimal trajectories for\npredicted vehicles as well as the desirable path for ego autonomous vehicle\ncould be easily generated.

As the availability and popularity of\npre-trained models are increasing, it is critical to protect the Intellectual\nProperty (IP) of the model owner.

The proposed framework embeds the fingerprints in the\nProbability Density Function (pdf) of trainable weights by leveraging the extra\ncapacity available in contemporary DL models. DeepMarks is robust against\nfingerprints collusion as well as network transformation attacks, including\nmodel compression and model fine-tuning. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations\non MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, as well as a wide variety of deep neural\nnetworks architectures such as Wide Residual Networks (WRNs) and Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs), corroborate the effectiveness and robustness of\nDeepMarks framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 17:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-11"}

This transfer\nincreases the binary orbital period, expanding the region of dynamical\ninstability around the binary, and destabilizing CBPs that tend to\npreferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After\nthe stars tidally lock, we find that angular momentum loss due to magnetic\nbraking can significantly shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of\ndynamical stability, over time impacting where surviving CBPs are observed\nrelative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of parameter\nspace and find that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most\nplausible initial conditions and that in some cases, the stability semi-major\naxis doubles from its initial value. We examine the dynamical and observable\nconsequences of a CBP falling within the dynamical instability limit by running\nN-body simulations of circumbinary planetary systems and find that typically,\nat least one planet is ejected from the system. We apply our theory to the\nshortest period {\\it Kepler} binary that possesses a CBP, Kepler-47, and find\nthat its existence is consistent with our model. Under conservative\nassumptions, we find that coupled stellar-tidal evolution of pre-main sequence\nbinary stars removes at least one close-in CBP in $87\\%$ of multi-planet\ncircumbinary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 18:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

The recent\nobservation of the binary NS (BNS) merger event GW170817 associated with GRB\n170817A brought a great deal of additional information and provided further\nsupport to the above connection, even though the identification of this burst\nas a canonical short GRB (SGRB) remains uncertain. Decades of observational\nconstraints and theoretical models consolidated the idea of a jet origin for\nthe GRB prompt emission, which can also explain the multiwavelength afterglow\nradiation observed in most of the events. However, the mechanisms through which\na BNS or NS-BH merger remnant would power a collimated outflow are much less\nconstrained. Understanding the properties of the remnant systems and whether\nthey can provide the right conditions for jet production has been a main driver\nof the great effort devoted to study BNS and NS-BH mergers, and still\nrepresents a real challenge from both the physical and the computational point\nof view. One fundamental open question concerns the nature of the central\nengine itself. While the leading candidate system is a BH surrounded by a\nmassive accretion disk, the recent observation of plateau-shaped X-ray\nafterglows in some SGRBs would suggest a longer-lived engine, i.e. a metastable\n(or even stable) massive NS, which would also exclude NS-BH progenitors. Here\nwe elaborate on this key aspect, considering three different scenarios to\nexplain the SGRB phenomenology based on different hypotheses on the nature of\nthe merger remnant. Then, we discuss the basic properties of GRB 170817A and\nhow this event would fit within the different frameworks of the above\nscenarios, under the assumption that it was or was not a canonical SGRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 18:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The achievable shortest pulse width is found to be limited by\nthird-order dispersion that has a significant effect on the pulse-compression\ndynamics. The output wavelength is red shifted because of intrapulse Raman\nscattering and depends heavily on third-order dispersion, whose positive values\nlead to the most red shifted solitons (>25% of the input pump center\nwavelength). The proposed scheme allows the generation of ultrashort pulse\ntrains at tunable high repetition rates with a wide range of output wavelengths\nand pulse durations through dispersion engineering.

When the spins are nearly extremal and\nantiparallel to each other, the resulting parameter estimates recover the small\neffective spin but incorrectly estimate the individual spins as nearly zero.

The 2016 Mw 7.8\nKaikoura earthquake in the northern South Island of New Zealand has been\nreported as one of the most complex continental earthquakes ever documented1,\nwhich resulted in a distinctive on and off-fault deformation pattern. Previous\ngeophysical studies confirm that the rupture globally propagated northward from\nepicenter. However, the exact rupture- propagation path is still not well\nunderstood because of the geometrical complexity, partly at sea, and the\npossibility of a blind thrust. Here we use a combination of state-of- the-art\nobservation of surface deformation, provided by optical image correlation, and\nfirst principle physics-based numerical modeling to determine the most likely\nrupture path. We quantify in detail the observed horizontal co-seismic\ndeformation and identify specific off-fault damage zones in the area of the\ntriple junction between the Jordan, the Kekerengu and the Papatea fault\nsegments. We also model dynamic rupture propagation, including the activation\nof off-fault damage, for two alternative rupture scenarios through the fault\ntriple junction. Comparing our observations with the results from the above two\nmodeled scenarios we show that only one of the scenarios best explains both the\non and off-fault deformation fields. Our results provide a unique insight into\nthe rupture pathway, by observing, and modeling, both on and off-fault\ndeformation.

This review aims to explain the principles of quantum\nprogramming, which are quite different from classical programming, with\nstraightforward algebra that makes understanding of the underlying fascinating\nquantum mechanical principles optional. We give an introduction to quantum\ncomputing algorithms and their implementation on real quantum hardware. We\nsurvey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a\nsuccinct and self-contained fashion.

Particular attention is given to the surface\nproperties of Ryugu that are relevant to sample acquisition. This reference\nmodel helps readers to appropriately interpret the data that will be directly\nobtained by Hayabusa2 and promotes scientific studies not only for Ryugu itself\nand other small bodies but also for the Solar System evolution that small\nbodies shed light on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 22:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

Over decades, the French sociologist Pierre\nBourdieu showed that people's success and their positions in society mainly\ndepend on how much they can spend (their economic capital) and what their\ninterests are (their cultural capital). For the first time, we adapt Bourdieu's\nframework to the city context.

It is expected to achieve a single\nphoton detection efficiency larger than 1\\%. The initial design consists of a\nbox made of highly reflective internal surface material and with an acceptance\nwindow for photons composed of two shifters and a dichroic filter. The first\nshifter converts liquid argon scintillation VUV light to a photon of wavelength\nsmaller than the dichroic cutoff, so the surface is highly transparent to it.\nWhen passing through the dichroic filter, it reaches the second shifter which\nallows the photon to be shifted to the visible region and be detected by the\nSiPM nested inside it. When it enters the box, the photon will likely reflect a\nfew times, including on the dichroic filter surface, before being detected.

We then\ncompare those predictions to the results of our atomistic simulations.\nConsistent with our predictions, our results show that the relaxation time\n$\\tau$ of the material undergoes a crossover from super-Arrhenius to Arrhenius\nbehavior at a cooling-rate-dependent glass transition temperature $T_\\text{g}$.\nThe slope of $\\ln\\tau$ with respect to inverse temperature exhibits a peak near\n$T_\\text{g}$ that grows more pronounced with slower cooling, matching our\nexpectations qualitatively. Additionally, the limiting value of this slope at\nlow temperature shows remarkable quantitative agreement with our predictions.\nOur results also show that the rate of short-time particle displacements\ndeviates from the equilibrium linear scaling around $T_\\text{g}$,\nasymptotically approaching a different linear scaling. To our surprise, these\nshort-time displacements, the dynamic indicators of the underlying excitations\nresponsible for structural relaxation, show no spatial correlations beyond a\nfew particle diameters, both above and below $T_\\text{g}$. This final result is\ncontrary to our expectation, based on previous results for East model glasses\nformed by cooling, that inter-excitation correlations should emerge as the\nliquid vitrifies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 01:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 22:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

Conventional 3DMM is learned from a set of well-controlled 2D face\nimages with associated 3D face scans, and represented by two sets of PCA basis\nfunctions. Due to the type and amount of training data, as well as the linear\nbases, the representation power of 3DMM can be limited. To address these\nproblems, this paper proposes an innovative framework to learn a nonlinear 3DMM\nmodel from a large set of unconstrained face images, without collecting 3D face\nscans. Specifically, given a face image as input, a network encoder estimates\nthe projection, shape and texture parameters. Two decoders serve as the\nnonlinear 3DMM to map from the shape and texture parameters to the 3D shape and\ntexture, respectively. With the projection parameter, 3D shape, and texture, a\nnovel analytically-differentiable rendering layer is designed to reconstruct\nthe original input face. The entire network is end-to-end trainable with only\nweak supervision. We demonstrate the superior representation power of our\nnonlinear 3DMM over its linear counterpart, and its contribution to face\nalignment and 3D reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 02:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 18:14:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 14:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), the\nsimple moir\\'e superlattice band description suggests that the electronic band\nwidth can be tuned to be comparable to the vdW interlayer interaction at a\n'magic angle', exhibiting strongly correlated behavior. However, the vdW\ninterlayer interaction can also cause significant structural reconstruction at\nthe interface by favoring interlayer commensurability, which competes with the\nintralayer lattice distortion. Here we report the atomic scale reconstruction\nin TBG and its effect on the electronic structure. We find a gradual transition\nfrom incommensurate moir\\'e structure to an array of commensurate domain\nstructures as we decrease the twist angle across the characteristic crossover\nangle, $\\theta_c$ ~1\\deg. In the twist regime smaller than $\\theta_c$ where the\natomic and electronic reconstruction become significant, a simple moir\\'e band\ndescription breaks down.

The observation and tuning of\nthe hidden QCP, which is critical in resolving the mystery, however, has been\nrarely reported due to lack of ideal systems. The helical antiferromagnet CrAs\nprovides an example in which a dome of superconductivity appears at a pressure\nwhere its magnetic transition goes to zero temperature. Here we report the\ntuning of a projected critical point in CrAs via Al chemical doping (Al-CrAs)\nand separation of the magnetic critical point from the pressure-induced\nsuperconducting phase. When CrAs is doped with Al, its AFM ordering temperature\nTN increases from 260 K to 270 K. With applied pressure, TN decreases and\nextrapolates to zero Kelvin near 4.5 kbar, which is shifted from 8 kbar for\nundoped CrAs. A funnel of anomalously enhanced electron scattering and a\nnon-Fermi liquid resistivity underscore an AFM QCP near 4.5 kbar in Al-CrAs.\nPressure-induced superconductivity, in contrast, is almost independent of Al\ndoping and forms a dome with essentially the identical maximum Tc and same\noptimal pressure as in pure CrAs. The clear separation between the tuned AFM\nQCP and Tc maximum in Al-CrAs suggests that superconductivity is independent of\nthe AFM QCP, illustrating subtleties in the interplay between superconductivity\nand quantum criticality in correlated electron systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 05:21:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 01:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

Instead of focusing\non hosts and their locations, CCN emphasizes addressable named content. By\ndecoupling content from its location, CCN allows opportunistic in-network\ncontent caching, thus enabling better network utilization, at least for\nscalable content distribution. However, in order to be considered seriously,\nCCN must support basic security services, including content authenticity,\nintegrity, confidentiality, authorization and access control. Current\napproaches rely on content producers to perform authorization and access\ncontrol. This general approach has several disadvantages. First, consumer\nprivacy vis-a-vis producers is not preserved. Second, identity management and\naccess control impose high computational overhead on producers. Also,\nunnecessary repeated authentication and access control decisions must be made\nfor each content request.\n  These issues motivate our design of KRB-CCN - a complete authorization and\naccess control system for private CCNs. Inspired by Kerberos in IP-based\nnetworks, KRB-CCN involves distinct authentication and authorization\nauthorities. By doing so, KRB-CCN obviates the need for producers to make\nconsumer authentication and access control decisions. KRB-CCN preserves\nconsumer privacy since producers are unaware of consumer identities. Producers\nare also not required to keep any hard state and only need to perform two\nsymmetric key operations to guarantee that sensitive content is confidentially\ndelivered only to authenticated and authorized consumers. Most importantly,\nunlike prior designs, KRB-CCN leaves the network (i.e., CCN routers) out of any\nauthorization, access control or confidentiality issues. We describe KRB-CCN\ndesign and implementation, analyze its security, and report on its performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 05:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

The velocity equation of light at\nthe black hole is represented in the spherical coordinate (r, thita, phi) and\nthe main parameters are the Schwarzschild radius RS, the rotation term a, and\nthe charged term RQ. From the calculations, the averagely radial speed of light\nfrom r=Rs to r= (alpha)Rs with alpha>1 is possibly exceeding the speed of light\nc in free space by an observer in a reference frame far away from the black\nhole like on Earth. The result extends to the large r region when the rotation\nof the black hole is very high or the charge is large enough.

Adaptation and response can be posed as an\noptimization problem, with a tradeoff between the benefit obtained from a\nresponse and the cost of producing environment-specific responses. Using recent\nresults in stochastic thermodynamics, we formulate the cost as the mutual\ninformation between the environment and the stochastic response. The problem of\ndesigning an optimally performing network now reduces to a problem in rate\ndistortion theory -- a branch of information theory that deals with lossy data\ncompression. We find that as the cost of unit information goes down, the system\nundergoes a sequence of transitions, corresponding to the recruitment of an\nincreasing number of responses, thus improving response specificity as well as\nthe net payoff.

The bath, on the one hand,\ndictates the dissipative evolution following a sudden quench and on the other,\nplays a role in dissipative mixed state preparation in the later part of the\nstudy. During a dissipative evolution following a sudden quench, no trace of\nDQPTs are revealed in both the fidelity and the interferometric phase\napproaches; however, remarkably the interferometric phase approach reveals the\npossibility of inter-steady state DQPTs in passage from one steady state to the\nother when the system is subjected to a quench after having reached the first\nsteady state. We further probe the occurrences of DQPTs when the system evolves\nunitarily after being prepared in a mixed state of engineered purity by ramping\nthe transverse field in a linear fashion in the presence of the bath. In this\ncase though the fidelity approach fails to indicate any DQPT, the\ninterferometric approach indeed unravels the possibility of occurrence of DQPTs\nwhich persists even up to a considerable loss of purity of the engineered\ninitial state as long as a constraint relation involving the dissipative\ncoupling and ramping time (rate) is satisfied. This constraint relation also\nmarks the boundary between two dynamically inequivalent phases; in one the LO\nvanishes for the critical momentum mode (and hence DQPTs exist) while in the\nother no such critical mode can exist and hence the LO never vanishes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 08:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

Next the dual\nMei\\ss ner effect, which assumes a condensate of magnetic monopoles, will be\nexplained as a picture of confinement. I will also show how magnetic monopoles\narises in QCD after the so-called Abelian projection. The second lecture is\ndevoted to the center vortex picture of confinement. Center vortices will be\ndefined both on the lattice and in the continuum. Within the center vortex\npicture the emergence of the area law for the Wilson loop as well as the\ndeconfinement phase transition at finite temperature will be explained.\nFurthermore, lattice evidence for the center vortex picture will be provided.\nFinally, I will discuss the topological properties of center vortices and their\nrelation to magnetic monopoles. I will provide evidence from lattice\ncalculations that center vortices are not only responsible for confinement but\nalso for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. In the last lecture I\nwill present the Hamiltonian approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge, which is then\nused to establish the Gribov--Zwanziger picture of confinement.

The number of muons observed at the ground from\nUHECR-induced air showers is expected to depend upon the hadronic interaction\nmodel. One may therefore test the hadronic interaction models by comparing the\nmeasured number of muons with the MC prediction. In this paper, we present the\nresults of studies of muon densities in UHE extensive air showers obtained by\nanalyzing the signal of surface detector stations which should have high\n$\\it{muon \\, purity}$. The muon purity of a station will depend on both the\ninclination of the shower and the relative position of the station. In 7 years'\ndata from the Telescope Array experiment, we find that the number of particles\nobserved for signals with an expected muon purity of $\\sim$65% at a lateral\ndistance of 2000 m from the shower core is $1.72 \\pm 0.10{\\rm (stat.)} \\pm 0.37\n{\\rm (syst.)}$ times larger than the MC prediction value using the QGSJET II-03\nmodel for proton-induced showers. A similar effect is also seen in comparisons\nwith other hadronic models such as QGSJET II-04, which shows a $1.67 \\pm 0.10\n\\pm 0.36$ excess. We also studied the dependence of these excesses on lateral\ndistances and found a slower decrease of the lateral distribution of muons in\nthe data as compared to the MC, causing larger discrepancy at larger lateral\ndistances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

A\nnew approach to multichannel dosimetry, based on experimental findings, i.e.,\nthe Multigaussian method, is introduced. The Multigaussian method assumes that\nthe probability density function of the response vector formed by the pixel\nvalues of the different color channels, including irradiated and non-irradiated\nscans, follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

Although the transformed theory is equivalent\nto GR in vacuum, the equivalence no longer holds if a matter field minimally\ncouples to the canonically transformed gravitational field. We find that a\nnaive matter coupling to the transformed field leads to the appearance of an\nextra mode in the phase space, rendering the theory inconsistent. We then find\na consistent and novel way of matter coupling: after imposing a gauge fixing\ncondition, a matter field can minimally couple to gravity without generating an\nunwanted extra mode. As a result, the way matter field couples to the\ngravitational field determines the preferred time direction and the resultant\ntheory has only two gravitational degrees of freedom. We also discuss the\ncosmological solution and linear perturbations around it, and confirm that\ntheir dynamics indeed differ from those in GR. The novel matter coupling can be\nused for a new framework of modified gravity theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 01:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

However, the intrinsic instability of\nexfoliated bP (the bP nanoflakes) towards both moisture and air has so far\novershadowed its practical implementation. In order to contribute to fill this\ngap, we report here the preparation of new hybrid polymer-based materials where\nbP nanoflakes exhibit a significantly improved stability. The new materials\nhave been prepared by different synthetic paths including: i) the mixing of\nconventionally liquid-phase exfoliated bP (in DMSO) with PMMA solution; ii) the\ndirect exfoliation of bP in a polymeric solution; iii) the in situ radical\npolymerization after exfoliating bP in the liquid monomer (methyl methacrylate,\nMMA). This last methodology concerns the preparation of stable suspensions of\nbPn-MMA by sonication-assisted liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of bP in the\npresence of MMA followed by radical polymerization. The hybrids characteristics\nhave been compared in order to evaluate the bP dispersion and the effectiveness\nof the bPn interfacial interactions with polymer chains aimed at their\nlong-term environmental stabilization. The passivation of bPn results\nparticularly effective when the hybrid material is prepared by in situ\npolymerization. By using this synthetic methodology, the nanoflakes, even if\nwith a gradient of dispersion (size of aggregates), preserve their chemical\nstructure from oxidation (as proved by both Raman and 31P-Solid State NMR\nstudies) and are particularly stable to air and UV light exposure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 09:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

This strong effect is widely documented.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to replicate this anchoring bias using professionals and,\nnovel in a software engineering context, explore de-biasing interventions\nthrough increasing knowledge and awareness of judgement biases. METHOD: We ran\ntwo series of experiments in company settings with a total of 410 software\ndevelopers. Some developers took part in a workshop to heighten their awareness\nof a range of cognitive biases, including anchoring. Later, the anchoring bias\nwas induced by presenting low or high productivity values, followed by the\nparticipants' estimates of their own project productivity. Our hypothesis was\nthat the workshop would lead to reduced bias, i.e., work as a de-biasing\nintervention. RESULTS: The anchors had a large effect (robust Cohen's $d=1.19$)\nin influencing estimates. This was substantially reduced in those participants\nwho attended the workshop (robust Cohen's $d=0.72$). The reduced bias related\nmainly to the high anchor. The de-biasing intervention also led to a threefold\nreduction in estimate variance.

The positive effect\nof de-biasing through learning about biases suggests that it has value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 10:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

This article\nsuggests a method for generating considerable amount of parallel corpus for any\nlanguage pairs, extracted from open source materials existing on the Internet.\nParallel corpus contents will be derived from video subtitles. It needs a set\nof video titles, with some attributes like release date, rating, duration and\netc. Process of finding and downloading subtitle pairs for desired language\npairs is automated by using a crawler. Finally sentence pairs will be extracted\nfrom synchronous dialogues in subtitles. The main problem of this method is\nunsynchronized subtitle pairs. Therefore subtitles will be verified before\ndownloading. If two subtitle were not synchronized, then another subtitle of\nthat video will be processed till it finds the matching subtitle. Using this\napproach gives ability to make context based parallel corpus through filtering\nvideos by genre. Context based corpus can be used in complex translators which\ndecode sentences by different networks after determining contents subject.\nLanguages have many differences in their formal and informal styles, including\nwords and syntax. Other advantage of this method is to make corpus of informal\nstyle of languages. Because most of movies dialogues are parts of a\nconversation. So they had informal style.

In VR environment, VR sickness can be\ncaused by several factors which are mismatched motion, field of view, motion\nparallax, viewing angle, etc. Similar to motion sickness, VR sickness can\ninduce a lot of physical symptoms such as general discomfort, headache, stomach\nawareness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and disorientation. To address the\nviewing safety issues in virtual environment, it is of great importance to\ndevelop an objective VR sickness assessment method that predicts and analyses\nthe degree of VR sickness induced by the VR content. The proposed method takes\ninto account motion information that is one of the most important factors in\ndetermining the overall degree of VR sickness. In this paper, we detect the\nexceptional motion that is likely to induce VR sickness. Spatio-temporal\nfeatures of the exceptional motion in the VR video content are encoded using a\nconvolutional autoencoder. For objectively assessing the VR sickness, the level\nof exceptional motion in VR video content is measured by using the\nconvolutional autoencoder as well. The effectiveness of the proposed method has\nbeen successfully evaluated by subjective assessment experiment using simulator\nsickness questionnaires (SSQ) in VR environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 11:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

Their interaction in one spatial dimension\nmay result in either reflection or merging into a single homoclinic wave,\ndepending on the strength of the invading species.

In\nparticular, a time-periodic homoclinic wave (breathing wave) is born from a\nHopf bifurcation and its unstable branch acts as a separator between the\nreflection and merging regimes. The same transition occurs in two spatial\ndimensions: the stable regular spiral associated to the homoclinic wave\ndestabilizes, giving rise first to an oscillating breathing spiral and then\nbreaking up producing a dynamic pattern characterized by many spiral cores.

In this paper, we focus on the\nfundamental special case of regions that are hyperplanes in the $d$-dimensional\nEuclidean space.

Our\nalgorithm is based on approximating the convex hull of the optimal tour by a\nconvex polytope of bounded complexity. Such polytopes are represented as\nsolutions of a sophisticated LP formulation, which we combine with the\nenumeration of crucial properties of the tour. As the approximation guarantee\napproaches $1$, our scheme adjusts the complexity of the considered polytopes\naccordingly.\n  In the analysis of our approximation scheme, we show that our search space\nincludes a sufficiently good approximation of the optimum.

To implement this approach\nin practice we require sequential Monte Carlo methods that have excellent\ncomputational and Monte Carlo properties.

Towards such goal,\nConvolutional Networks can learn specific and adaptable features based on the\ndata. However, these networks are not capable of processing a whole remote\nsensing image, given its huge size. To overcome such limitation, the image is\nprocessed using fixed size patches. The definition of the input patch size is\nusually performed empirically (evaluating several sizes) or imposed (by network\nconstraint). Both strategies suffer from drawbacks and could not lead to the\nbest patch size. To alleviate this problem, several works exploited\nmulti-context information by combining networks or layers.

In practical\napplications, however, one frequently encounters more complicated expressions,\ninvolving transposition, inversion, and matrix properties. Indeed, the\ncomputation of such expressions relies on a set of computational kernels that\noffer functionality well beyond the simple matrix product. The challenge then\nshifts from finding an optimal parenthesization to finding an optimal mapping\nof the input expression to the available kernels. Furthermore, it is often the\ncase that a solution based on the minimization of scalar operations does not\nresult in the optimal solution in terms of execution time.

We\ninvestigate a discrete time model where the time axis is partitioned into\nframes. Each frame consists of a sensing phase, followed by a transmission\nphase. During the sensing phase, the user is able to sense a subset of channels\nsequentially before it decides to use one of them in the following transmission\nphase. We assume the channel states alternate between busy and idle according\nto independent Bernoulli random processes from frame to frame. To capture the\ninherent uncertainty in channel sensing, we assume the reward of each\ntransmission when the channel is idle is a random variable. We also associate\nrandom costs with sensing and transmission actions. Our objective is to\nunderstand how the costs and reward of the actions would affect the optimal\nbehavior of the user in both offline and online settings, and design the\ncorresponding opportunistic spectrum access strategies to maximize the expected\ncumulative net reward (i.e., reward-minus-cost).

Previous work has found\nlittle evidence for correlations between large-scale bias and halo mass\nassembly history for simulated cluster-sized halos, in contrast to the\nsignificant correlation found between bias and concentration for halos of this\nmass. This difference in behavior is surprising, given that both concentration\nand assembly history are closely related to the same properties of the\nlinear-density peaks that collapse to form halos. Using publicly available\nsimulations, we show that significant assembly bias is indeed found in the most\nmassive halos with $M\\sim 10^{15}M_\\odot$, using essentially any definition of\nhalo age. For lower halo masses $M\\sim 10^{14}M_\\odot$, no correlation is found\nbetween bias and the commonly used age indicator $a_{0.5}$, the half-mass time.\nWe show that this is a mere accident, and that significant assembly bias exists\nfor other definitions of halo age, including those based on the time when the\nhalo progenitor acquires some fraction $f$ of the ultimate mass at $z=0$. For\nhalos with $M_{\\rm vir}\\sim 10^{14}M_\\odot$, the sense of assembly bias changes\nsign at $f=0.5$. We explore the origin of this behavior, and argue that it\narises because standard definitions of halo mass in halo finders do not\ncorrespond to the collapsed, virialized mass that appears in the spherical\ncollapse model used to predict large-scale clustering. Because bias depends\nstrongly on halo mass, these errors in mass definition can masquerade as or\neven obscure the assembly bias that is physically present.

Here we focus on the\nDrossel-Schwable forest-fire model (FFM) of SOC and show that despite the model\nhas been proved to not being critical, it nevertheless exhibits a behavior that\njustifies the introduction of a new kind of $\\textit{weak}$ criticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 11:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

This embedding is\nnatural in the sense of properties of the vector bundle defined by Feynman\nintegrals on the complement to Landau varieties. We point out that there is a\nholonomic D-module associated with individual Feynman integrals. We quote\nexplicit generators for this D-module on the fully deformed space of particle\nmomenta. This basis is quadratic in the derivatives. We conclude that there is\nholonomic D-module on the physical space of momenta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 04:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}
