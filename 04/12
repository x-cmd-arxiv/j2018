Motion-blurred images are the result of an averaging process, where\ninstant frames are accumulated over time during the exposure of the sensor.\nUnfortunately, reversing this process is nontrivial. Firstly, averaging\ndestroys the temporal ordering of the frames. Secondly, the recovery of a\nsingle frame is a blind deconvolution task, which is highly ill-posed. We\npresent a deep learning scheme that gradually reconstructs a temporal ordering\nby sequentially extracting pairs of frames. Our main contribution is to\nintroduce loss functions invariant to the temporal order. This lets a neural\nnetwork choose during training what frame to output among the possible\ncombinations. We also address the ill-posedness of deblurring by designing a\nnetwork with a large receptive field and implemented via resampling to achieve\na higher computational efficiency. Our proposed method can successfully\nretrieve sharp image sequences from a single motion blurred image and can\ngeneralize well on synthetic and real datasets captured with different cameras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 16:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}

Since pooling by nature is\na lossy process, it is crucial that each such layer maintains the portion of\nthe activations that is most important for the network's discriminability. Yet,\nsimple maximization or averaging over blocks, max or average pooling, or plain\ndownsampling in the form of strided convolutions are the standard.

Inspired by the human visual system, which focuses on local\nspatial changes, we propose detail-preserving pooling (DPP), an adaptive\npooling method that magnifies spatial changes and preserves important\nstructural detail. Importantly, its parameters can be learned jointly with the\nrest of the network.

The framework unifies theoretical and methodological\naspects of past research on mean bias reduction and accommodates, in a natural\nway, new advances on median bias reduction. General expressions for the\nadjusted score functions are derived in terms of quantities that are readily\navailable in standard software for fitting generalized linear models. The\nresulting estimating equations are solved using a unifying quasi-Fisher scoring\nalgorithm that is shown to be equivalent to iteratively re-weighted least\nsquares with appropriately adjusted working variates. Formal links between the\niterations for mean and median bias reduction are established. Core model\ninvariance properties are used to develop a novel mixed adjustment strategy\nwhen the estimation of a dispersion parameter is necessary.

Here we aim to fill this gap by presenting a comparative study on\nhow 919 thousand biomedical papers are cited by U.S. patents and by other\npapers over time. We observe a positive correlation between citations from\npatents and from papers, but there is little overlap between the two domains in\neither the most cited papers, or papers with the most delayed recognition. We\nalso find that the two types of citations exhibit distinct temporal variations,\nwith patent citations lagging behind paper citations for a median of 6 years\nfor the majority of papers. Our work contributes to the understanding of the\ntechnological impact of papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 17:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 21:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

Logical qubits can be encoded in a variety of ways in the surface\ncode, based on either boundary defects, holes, or bulk twist defects. However\nproposed fault-tolerant implementations of the Clifford group in these schemes\nare limited and often require unnecessary overhead. For example, the Clifford\nphase gate in certain planar and hole encodings has been proposed to be\nimplemented using costly state injection and distillation protocols. In this\npaper, we show that within any encoding scheme for the logical qubits, we can\nfault-tolerantly implement the full Clifford group by using joint measurements\ninvolving a single appropriately encoded logical ancilla. This allows us to\nprovide new low overhead implementations of the full Clifford group in surface\nand color codes.

Grain boundaries (GBs) are ubiquitous defects in\npolycrystalline materials, which scatter phonons and reduce thermal\nconductivity. Historically, their impact on heat conduction has been studied\nindirectly through spatially-averaged measurements, that provide little\ninformation about phonon transport near a single GB. Here, using\nspatially-resolved time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) measurements in\ncombination with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), we make localized\nmeasurements of thermal conductivity within few \\mu m of individual GBs in\nboron-doped polycrystalline diamond. We observe strongly suppressed thermal\ntransport near GBs, a reduction in conductivity from ~1000 W/m-K at the center\nof large grains to ~400 W/m-K in the immediate vicinity of GBs. Furthermore, we\nshow that this reduction in conductivity is measured up to ~10 \\mu m away from\na GB. A theoretical model is proposed that captures the local reduction in\nphonon mean-free-paths due to strongly diffuse phonon scattering at the\ndisordered grain boundaries. Our results provide a new framework for\nunderstanding phonon-defect interactions in nanomaterials, with implications\nfor the use of high thermal conductivity polycrystalline materials as heat\nsinks in electronics thermal management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 18:40:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 23:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

While PowerShell can be configured by\nadministrators for restricting access and reducing vulnerabilities, these\nrestrictions can be bypassed. Moreover, PowerShell commands can be easily\ngenerated dynamically, executed from memory, encoded and obfuscated, thus\nmaking the logging and forensic analysis of code executed by PowerShell\nchallenging.For all these reasons, PowerShell is increasingly used by\ncybercriminals as part of their attacks' tool chain, mainly for downloading\nmalicious contents and for lateral movement. Indeed, a recent comprehensive\ntechnical report by Symantec dedicated to PowerShell's abuse by cybercrimials\nreported on a sharp increase in the number of malicious PowerShell samples they\nreceived and in the number of penetration tools and frameworks that use\nPowerShell. This highlights the urgent need of developing effective methods for\ndetecting malicious PowerShell commands.In this work, we address this challenge\nby implementing several novel detectors of malicious PowerShell commands and\nevaluating their performance.

The conventional LSTM, however,\nfails to take into consideration the impact of salient spatio-temporal dynamics\npresent in the sequential input data. This problem was first addressed by the\ndifferential Recurrent Neural Network (dRNN), which uses a differential gating\nscheme known as Derivative of States (DoS). DoS uses higher orders of internal\nstate derivatives to analyze the change in information gain caused by the\nsalient motions between the successive frames. The weighted combination of\nseveral orders of DoS is then used to modulate the gates in dRNN. While each\nindividual order of DoS is good at modeling a certain level of salient\nspatio-temporal sequences, the sum of all the orders of DoS could distort the\ndetected motion patterns. To address this problem, we propose to control the\nLSTM gates via individual orders of DoS and stack multiple levels of LSTM cells\nin an increasing order of state derivatives. The proposed model progressively\nbuilds up the ability of the LSTM gates to detect salient dynamical patterns in\ndeeper stacked layers modeling higher orders of DoS, and thus the proposed LSTM\nmodel is termed deep differential Recurrent Neural Network (d2RNN). The\neffectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on two publicly available\nhuman activity datasets: NUS-HGA and Violent-Flows.

The differential techniques (e.g., real-time kinematic (RTK))\nhave several attractive properties, such as correlated error mitigation and\nfast convergence; however, to support a differential processing scheme, an\ninfrastructure of reference stations within a proximity of the platform must be\nin place to construct observation corrections. This infrastructure requirement\nmakes differential processing techniques infeasible in many locations. To\nmitigate the need for additional receivers within proximity of the platform,\nthe precise point positioning (PPP) method utilizes accurate orbit and clock\nmodels to localize the platform. The autonomy of PPP from local reference\nstations make it an attractive processing scheme for several applications;\nhowever, a current disadvantage of PPP is the slow positioning convergence when\ncompared to differential techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the convergence\nproperties of PPP with an incremental graph optimization scheme (Incremental\nSmoothing and Mapping (iSAM2)), which allows for real-time filtering and\nsmoothing. The characterization is first conducted through a Monte Carlo\nanalysis within a simulation environment, which allows for the variations of\nparameters, such as atmospheric conditions, satellite geometry, and intensity\nof multipath.

A new\narchitecture recently introduced by Sabour et al., referred to as a capsule\nnetworks with dynamic routing, has shown great initial results for digit\nrecognition and small image classification. The success of capsule networks\nlies in their ability to preserve more information about the input by replacing\nmax-pooling layers with convolutional strides and dynamic routing, allowing for\npreservation of part-whole relationships in the data. This preservation of the\ninput is demonstrated by reconstructing the input from the output capsule\nvectors. Our work expands the use of capsule networks to the task of object\nsegmentation for the first time in the literature. We extend the idea of\nconvolutional capsules with locally-connected routing and propose the concept\nof deconvolutional capsules. Further, we extend the masked reconstruction to\nreconstruct the positive input class. The proposed\nconvolutional-deconvolutional capsule network, called SegCaps, shows strong\nresults for the task of object segmentation with substantial decrease in\nparameter space. As an example application, we applied the proposed SegCaps to\nsegment pathological lungs from low dose CT scans and compared its accuracy and\nefficiency with other U-Net-based architectures.

Being able to efficiently identify the truly relevant\nmarkers in discovery studies can significantly simplify the process.

Hence discovery studies suffer from\nsparsity and high dimensionality issues.

Our analysis reveals that Directed hate speech, in\naddition to being more personal and directed, is more informal, angrier, and\noften explicitly attacks the target (via name calling) with fewer analytic\nwords and more words suggesting authority and influence. Generalized hate\nspeech, on the other hand, is dominated by religious hate, is characterized by\nthe use of lethal words such as murder, exterminate, and kill; and quantity\nwords such as million and many. Altogether, our work provides a data-driven\nanalysis of the nuances of online-hate speech that enables not only a deepened\nunderstanding of hate speech and its social implications but also its\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 23:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-13"}

The main challenge is the disambiguation of the\ncamera motion from scene motion, which becomes more difficult as the amount of\nrigidity observed decreases, even with successful estimation of 2D image\ncorrespondences. Compared to other state-of-the-art 3D scene flow estimation\nmethods, in this paper we propose to \\emph{learn} the rigidity of a scene in a\nsupervised manner from a large collection of dynamic scene data, and directly\ninfer a rigidity mask from two sequential images with depths.

For\ntraining and testing the rigidity network, we also provide a new semi-synthetic\ndynamic scene dataset (synthetic foreground objects with a real background) and\nan evaluation split that accounts for the percentage of observed non-rigid\npixels.

We utilize a self-consistent\nmicroscopic method that can accommodate the broad range of energy scales\npresent, and ensures proximity effects that account for the interactions at the\ninterfaces are accurately determined. Two experimentally relevant half-metallic\njunction types are considered: The first is a $F_1 F_2 S$ structure, where a\nhalf-metallic ferromagnet $F_1$ adjoins a weaker conventional ferromagnet\n$F_2$. The current is injected through the $F_1$ layer by means of an applied\nbias voltage. The second configuration involves a $S F_1 F_2 F_3 S$ Josephson\njunction whereby a phase difference $\\Delta\\varphi$ between the two\nsuperconducting electrodes generates the supercurrent flow. In this case, the\ncentral half-metallic $F_2$ layer is surrounded by two weak ferromagnets $F_1$\nand $F_3$. By placing a ferromagnet with a weak exchange field adjacent to an\n$S$ layer, we are able to optimize the conversion process in which\nopposite-spin triplet pairs are converted into equal-spin triplet pairs that\npropagate deep into the half-metallic regions in both junction types. For the\ntunnel junctions, we study the bias-induced local magnetization, spin currents,\nand spin transfer torques for various orientations of the relative\nmagnetization angle $\\theta$ in the $F$ layers. We find that the bias-induced\nequal-spin triplet pairs are maximized in the half-metal for\n$\\theta\\approx90^\\circ$ and as part of the conversion process, are\nanticorrelated with the opposite-spin pairs. We show that the charge current\ndensity is maximized, corresponding to the occurrence of a large amplitude of\nequal-spin triplet pairs, when the exchange interaction of the weak ferromagnet\nis about $0.1E_F.$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 01:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

Endemic in approaches to realize such intelligence in\nmachines is catastrophic forgetting: sequential learning corrupts knowledge\nobtained earlier in the sequence, or tasks antagonistically compete for system\nresources. Methods for obviating catastrophic forgetting have sought to\nidentify and preserve features of the system necessary to solve one problem\nwhen learning to solve another, or to enforce modularity such that minimally\noverlapping sub-functions contain task specific knowledge. While successful,\nboth approaches scale poorly because they require larger architectures as the\nnumber of training instances grows, causing different parts of the system to\nspecialize for separate subsets of the data. Here we present a method for\naddressing catastrophic forgetting called developmental compression. It\nexploits the mild impacts of developmental mutations to lessen adverse changes\nto previously-evolved capabilities and `compresses' specialized neural networks\ninto a generalized one. In the absence of domain knowledge, developmental\ncompression produces systems that avoid overt specialization, alleviating the\nneed to engineer a bespoke system for every task permutation and suggesting\nbetter scalability than existing approaches.

However, uncertainties in transport models (or model\ndependence) partly affect the reliability of the extracted result. In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted. The incompressibility is deduced\nfrom the comparison of the UrQMD model simulations and the FOPI data for\nrapidity-dependent elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at beam energies\n0.4\\emph{A} - 1.0\\emph{A} GeV. The elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of\nrapidity $y_0$ can be well described by a quadratic fit $v_2=v_{20} +\nv_{22}\\cdot y_0^2 $. It is found that the quantity $v_{2n}$ defined by\n$v_{2n}=|v_{20}|+|v_{22}|$ is quite sensitive to the incompressibility $K_0$\nand the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, but not sensitive to the slope\nparameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy. With the FU3FP4 parametrization\nof the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, an averaged $K_0 = 220 \\pm\n40$~MeV is extracted from the $v_{2n}$ of free protons and deuterons. However,\nremaining systematic uncertainties, partly related to the choice of in-medium\nnucleon-nucleon cross sections, are of the same magnitude ($\\pm 40$~MeV).\nOverall, the rapidity dependent elliptic flow supports a soft symmetric-matter\nequation-of-state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 02:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-13"}

The expressions for the mean and variance of the Taylor\napproximation are known analytically, although their evaluation requires\nefficient computation of the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian of the\ncontrol objective.

MRA\nacquisitions are typically ordered for vascular interventions, whereas in\ntypical scenarios, MRA sequences can be absent in the patient scans. This\nmotivates the need for a technique that generates inexistent MRA from existing\nMR multi-contrast, which could be a valuable tool in retrospective subject\nevaluations and imaging studies. In this paper, we present a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) based technique to generate MRA from T1-weighted and\nT2-weighted MRI images, for the first time to our knowledge. To better model\nthe representation of vessels which the MRA inherently highlights, we design a\nloss term dedicated to a faithful reproduction of vascularities.

Higher expressiveness supports\nmore complex reasoning logic, however, it may also hinder system scalability.\nCurrent research mainly focuses on logical frameworks suitable for stream\nreasoning as well as the implementation and the evaluation of prototype\nsystems. These systems are normally developed in a centralized setting which\nsuffer from inherent limited scalability, while an in-depth study of applying\ndistributed solutions to cover E&S is still missing. In this paper, we aim to\nexplore the feasibility of applying modern distributed computing frameworks to\nmeet E&S all together. To do so, we first propose BigSR, a technical\ndemonstrator that supports a positive fragment of the LARS framework. For the\nsake of generality and to cover a wide variety of use cases, BigSR relies on\nthe two main execution models adopted by major distributed execution\nframeworks: Bulk Synchronous Processing (BSP) and Record-at-A-Time (RAT).\nAccordingly, we implement BigSR on top of Apache Spark Streaming (BSP model)\nand Apache Flink (RAT model). In order to conclude on the impacts of BSP and\nRAT on E&S, we analyze the ability of the two models to support distributed\nstream reasoning and identify several types of use cases characterized by their\nlevels of support. This classification allows for quantifying the E&S trade-off\nby assessing the scalability of each type of use case \\wrt its level of\nexpressiveness. Then, we conduct a series of experiments with 15 queries from 4\ndifferent datasets. Our experiments show that BigSR over both BSP and RAT\ngenerally scales up to high throughput beyond million-triples per second (with\nor without recursion), and RAT attains sub-millisecond delay for stateless\nquery operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 08:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-13"}

So far, our understanding of the process of colloidal gelation is\nlimited to long-time dynamical effects, where gelation is viewed as a phase\nseparation process interrupted by the glass transition. However, this picture\nneglects two important effects: the influence of hydrodynamic interactions, and\nthe emergence of mechanical stability. With confocal microscopy experiments,\nhere we successfully follow the entire process of gelation with a\nsingle-particle resolution, yielding time-resolved measures of internal stress\nand viscoelasticity from the very beginning of the aggregation process. First,\nwe demonstrate that the incompressible nature of a liquid component constrains\nthe initial stage of phase separation, assisting the formation of a percolated\nnetwork.

In both\ncases, CLSM data shows excellent correlation with conventional optical\nmicroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, conductive\natomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Raman mapping, with a\ngreatly reduced acquisition time. We demonstrate that CLSM is an indispensable\ntool for rapid analysis of mass-produced graphene and is equally relevant to\nother 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 10:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-13"}

These networks have extensively been studied using graphlets, small\ninduced subgraphs capturing the local wiring patterns around nodes in networks.\nThey revealed that proteins involved in similar functions tend to be similarly\nwired. However, such simple models can only represent pairwise relationships\nand cannot fully capture the higher-order organization of protein interactions,\nincluding protein complexes. Results: To model the multi-sale organization of\nthese complex biological systems, we utilize simplicial complexes from\ncomputational geometry. The question is how to mine these new representations\nof PPI networks to reveal additional biological information. To address this,\nwe define simplets, a generalization of graphlets to simplicial complexes. By\nusing simplets, we define a sensitive measure of similarity between simplicial\ncomplex network representations that allows for clustering them according to\ntheir data types better than clustering them by using other state-of-the-art\nmeasures, e.g., spectral distance, or facet distribution distance. We model\nhuman and baker's yeast PPI networks as simplicial complexes that capture PPIs\nand protein complexes as simplices. On these models, we show that our newly\nintroduced simplet-based methods cluster proteins by function better than the\nclustering methods that use the standard PPI networks, uncovering the new\nunderlying functional organization of the cell.

This raises a number of\nquestions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all? Is it\nimportant? Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance?

In this work, we rigorously\ntest these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional\nnetworks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is\nnot a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different\ndegrees of deformation stability at different layers. (2) Deformation stability\nis not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of\ntraining, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters.

The method is an alternative to using an adjoint, which can be very\nchallenging to formulate and also computationally expensive to solve. The main\nnovelties of the presented approach are: 1) the use of goals, weighting the\nperturbation to help resolve the most important sensitivities, 2) the use of\ntime windows, which enable the perturbations to be optimised independently for\neach window and 3) re-orthogonalisation of the solution through time, which\nhelps optimise each perturbation when calculating sensitivity maps. These novel\nmethods greatly reduce the number of ensembles required to form the sensitivity\nmaps as demonstrated in this paper. As the presented method relies solely on\nensembles obtained from the forward model, it can therefore be applied directly\nto forward models of arbitrary complexity arising from, for example,\nmulti-physics coupling, legacy codes or model chains. It can also be applied to\ncompute sensitivities for optimisation of sensor placement, optimisation for\ndesign or control, goal-based mesh adaptivity, assessment of goals (e.g. hazard\nassessment and mitigation in the natural environment), determining the worth of\ncurrent data and data assimilation.\n  We analyse and demonstrate the efficiency of the approach by applying the\nmethod to advection problems and also a non-linear heterogeneous multi-phase\nporous media problem, showing, in all cases, that the number of ensembles\nrequired to obtain accurate sensitivity maps is relatively low, in the order of\n10s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 12:13:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 12:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}

The dark matter halos of central galaxies are in virial\nequilibrium and thus the stellar velocity dispersion is also proportional to\ndark matter halo mass. This proportionality holds even when a line-of-sight\naperture dispersion is calculated in analogy to observations.

For rain streak removal, although an\ninput image can be decomposed into a scene layer and a rain streak layer, there\nexists no explicit formulation for modeling rain streaks and the composition\nwith scene layer.

In this\npaper, a model reference control based inertia emulation strategy is proposed\nfor diesel-wind systems. Desired inertia can be precisely emulated through the\nproposed strategy. A typical frequency response model with parametric inertia\nis set to be the reference model. A measurement at a specific location delivers\nthe information about the disturbance acting on the diesel-wind system to the\nreference model. The objective is for the speed of the diesel generator to\ntrack the reference so that the desired inertial response is realized. In\naddition, polytopic parameter uncertainty will be considered.

The parameters of the reference model are scheduled to ensure adequate\nfrequency response under a pre-defined worst case.

In particular, we consider binary\ncodebooks that allow for unique string reconstruction and propose a new method,\ntermed repeat replacement, to create the codebook.

The aim of the present study is to extend the\nobservations available in the literature on relative dispersion of fluid\nparticle pairs to wall-bounded turbulent flows, by means of particle pair\ntracking in direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow. The\nmean-square change of separation between particle pairs follows a clear\nballistic regime at short times for all wall distances. The Eulerian structure\nfunctions governing this short-time separation are characterised in the\nchannel, and allow to define a characteristic time scale for the ballistic\nregime, as well as a suitable normalisation of the mean-square separation\nleading to an overall collapse for different wall distances. Through fluid\nparticle pair tracking backwards and forwards in time, the temporal asymmetry\nof relative dispersion is illustrated. At short times, this asymmetry is linked\nto the irreversibility of turbulence, as in previous studies on homogeneous\nisotropic flows. The influence of the initial separation (distance and\norientation) as well as the influence of mean shear are addressed. By\ndecomposing the mean-square separation into the dispersion by the fluctuating\nvelocity field and by the average velocity, it is shown that the influence of\nmean shear becomes important at early stages of dispersion close to the wall\nbut also near the channel centre.

Based on density\nfunctional theory calculations, we explore a large number of configurations of\nvacancy, adatom and antisite defects and analyse their atomic structure,\nthermodynamic stability, electronic and magnetic properties. The emerging\npicture suggests that, under thermodynamic equilibrium, 1$T'$-MoS$_2$ is more\nprone to hosting lattice imperfections than the 2$H$ phase. More specifically,\nour findings reveal that the S atoms that are closer to the Mo atomic plane are\nthe most reactive sites.

We propose a new family of probability models motivated by\nthe idea of network growth, which we call the Latent Order Logistic (LOLOG)\nmodel. LOLOG is a fully general framework capable of describing any probability\ndistribution over graph configurations, though not all distributions are easily\nexpressible or estimable as a LOLOG. We develop inferential procedures based on\nMonte Carlo Method of Moments, Generalized Method of Moments and variational\ninference. To show the flexibility of the model framework, we show how\nso-called scale-free networks can be modeled as LOLOGs via preferential\nattachment. The advantages of LOLOG in terms of avoidance of degeneracy, ease\nof sampling, and model flexibility are illustrated. Connections with the\npopular Exponential-family Random Graph model (ERGM) are also explored, and we\nfind that they are identical in the case of dyadic independence. Finally, we\napply the model to a social network of collaboration within a corporate law\nfirm, a friendship network among adolescent students, and the friendship\nrelations in an online social network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 15:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-13"}

In C-V2X, vehicles can directly\ncommunicate over PC5 based dedicated sidelinks called direct mode or V2V\ncommunication. However, high vehicle densities may require reuse of cellular\nspectrum for V2V. Moreover, infrastructure mode communication through V2I/N\nlinks can augment V2V communication by enhancing communication range and\nreliability for enhanced safety along with consistent performance under traffic\ncongestions. Motivated by the stringent connection reliability, spectral\nefficiency, and coverage requirements in C-V2X, this paper presents the first\ncomprehensive and tractable analytical framework for performance of C-V2X\nnetworks over shared V2V and cellular uplink channels, where the transmitting\nvehicles can deliver their information via infrastructure or direct mode, based\non their distances, propagation environments and the bias factor. By\npractically modeling the vehicles on the roads using the doubly stochastic Cox\nprocess and the base-stations, we derive new association probabilities, new\nsuccess probabilities of infrastructure and direct mode, and overall success\nprobability of the C-V2X communication over shared channels, which are\nvalidated by the simulations results. Our results reveal the benefits of our\nproposed model (possibility of selecting both direct and infrastructure modes\nover shared channels) compared to V2V network in terms of success probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 18:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 23:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}
