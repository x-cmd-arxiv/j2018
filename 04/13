A low-mass brown dwarf has been recently imaged around HR 2562 (HD\n50571), a star hosting a debris disk resolved in the far infrared.\nInterestingly, the companion location is compatible with an orbit coplanar with\nthe disk and interior to the debris belt. This feature makes the system a\nvaluable laboratory to analyze the formation of substellar companions in a\ncircumstellar disk and potential disk-companion dynamical interactions. Aims.\nWe aim to further characterize the orbital motion of HR 2562 B and its\ninteractions with the host star debris disk. Methods. We performed a monitoring\nof the system over ~10 months in 2016 and 2017 with the VLT/SPHERE exoplanet\nimager. Results. We confirm that the companion is comoving with the star and\ndetect for the first time an orbital motion at high significance, with a\ncurrent orbital motion projected in the plane of the sky of 25 mas (~0.85 au)\nper year. No orbital curvature is seen in the measurements. An orbital fit of\nthe SPHERE and literature astrometry of the companion without priors on the\norbital plane clearly indicates that its orbit is (quasi-)coplanar with the\ndisk. To further constrain the other orbital parameters, we used empirical laws\nfor a companion chaotic zone validated by N-body simulations to test the\norbital solutions that are compatible with the estimated disk cavity size.\nNon-zero eccentricities (>0.15) are allowed for orbital periods shorter than\n100 yr, while only moderate eccentricities up to ~0.3 for orbital periods\nlonger than 200 yr are compatible with the disk observations. A comparison of\nsynthetic Herschel images to the real data does not allow us to constrain the\nupper eccentricity of the companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 21:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

Different from conventional\nhole-type multipliers (e.g. Gas Electron Multipliers - GEMs, Thick Gas Electron\nMultipliers - THGEMs, etc.), which are characterized by a variable\n(dipole-like) field strength inside the avalanche gap, electrons in MM-THGEMs\nare largely multiplied by a strong uniform field established between the two\nmeshes, like in the parallel-plate avalanche geometry.

GCs form in converging gas flows\nand accumulate low-angular momentum gas, which accretes onto protostars.

A SMS can form via runaway collisions if the cluster reaches\nsufficiently high density before two-body relaxation halts the contraction.\nThis condition is met if the number of stars $\\gtrsim10^6$ and the gas\naccretion rate $\\gtrsim10^5\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$/Myr, reminiscent of GC formation in\nhigh gas-density environments, such as -- but not restricted to -- the early\nUniverse.

Because\nof continuous rejuvenation, the amount of processed material liberated by the\nSMS can be an order of magnitude higher than its maximum mass.

While the HF ground state absorption,\nanother H$_2$ proxy in diffuse gas, frequently suffers from saturation, CH\nremains transparent both in spiral-arm crossings and high-mass star forming\nregions, turning this light hydride into a universal surrogate for H$_2$.\nHowever, in slow shocks and in regions dissipating turbulence its abundance is\nexpected to be enhanced by an endothermic production path, and the idea of a\n\"canonical\" CH abundance needs to be addressed.

In this paper, we propose a time-frequency (T-F) segmentation\nframework trained on weakly labelled data to tackle the sound event detection\nand separation problem. In training, a segmentation mapping is applied on a T-F\nrepresentation, such as log mel spectrogram of an audio clip to obtain T-F\nsegmentation masks of sound events. The T-F segmentation masks can be used for\nseparating the sound events from the background scenes in the time-frequency\ndomain.

We model the\nsegmentation mapping using a convolutional neural network and the\nclassification mapping using a global weighted rank pooling (GWRP).

In the summer, melt ponds form on the surface of Arctic sea\nice, significantly lowering the ice reflectivity (albedo) and thereby\naccelerating ice melt. Pond geometry controls the details of this crucial\nfeedback; however, a reliable model of pond geometry does not currently exist.\nHere we show that a simple model of voids surrounding randomly sized and placed\noverlapping circles reproduces the essential features of pond patterns. The\nonly two model parameters, characteristic circle radius and coverage fraction,\nare chosen by comparing, between the model and the aerial photographs of the\nponds, two correlation functions which determine the typical pond size and\ntheir connectedness. Using these parameters, the void model robustly reproduces\nthe ponds' area-perimeter and area-abundance relationships over more than 6\norders of magnitude. By analyzing the correlation functions of ponds on several\ndates, we also find that the pond scale and the connectedness are surprisingly\nconstant across different years and ice types. Moreover, we find that ponds\nresemble percolation clusters near the percolation threshold. These results\ndemonstrate that the geometry and abundance of Arctic melt ponds can be simply\ndescribed, which can be exploited in future models of Arctic melt ponds that\nwould improve predictions of the response of sea ice to Arctic warming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 00:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

Yet it is\nunclear how to best do this: optimal dispatching requires optimizing over\nseveral sources of uncertainty, including vehicles' travel times to their\ndispatched locations, as well as coordinating between vehicles so that they do\nnot attempt to pick up the same passenger. While prior works have developed\nmodels for this uncertainty and used them to optimize dispatch policies, in\nthis work we introduce a model-free approach. Specifically, we propose MOVI, a\nDeep Q-network (DQN)-based framework that directly learns the optimal vehicle\ndispatch policy. Since DQNs scale poorly with a large number of possible\ndispatches, we streamline our DQN training and suppose that each individual\nvehicle independently learns its own optimal policy, ensuring scalability at\nthe cost of less coordination between vehicles. We then formulate a centralized\nreceding-horizon control (RHC) policy to compare with our DQN policies. To\ncompare these policies, we design and build MOVI as a large-scale realistic\nsimulator based on 15 million taxi trip records that simulates policy-agnostic\nresponses to dispatch decisions. We show that the DQN dispatch policy reduces\nthe number of unserviced requests by 76% compared to without dispatch and 20%\ncompared to the RHC approach, emphasizing the benefits of a model-free approach\nand suggesting that there is limited value to coordinating vehicle actions.\nThis finding may help to explain the success of ridesharing platforms, for\nwhich drivers make individual decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 00:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

This process requires criteria and an appropriate method\nas there are clear identifiers as well as quasi-identifiers that are not\nreadily identifiable. Methods; To formulate such a method, first, primary\nquasi-identifiers were selected by classifying information in 20 clinical\npersonal information database tables into Direct-Identifier (DID),\nQuasi-Identifier (QI), Sensitive Attribute (SA), and Non-Sensitive Attribute\n(NSA) according to its type.

In this paper, we shed light on the\npotential and implementation of IM technique for QAM based FBMC system. We\nstart with a mathematical model of the IM based QAM-FBMC system (FBMC/QAM-IM)\nalong with the derivation of interference terms at the receiver due to channel\ndistortions and noise. The interference terms including the ones introduced by\nthe multipath channel are analyzed in terms of MSE and output SINR. It is shown\nwith analytical and simulation results that the interference power in\nFBMC/QAM-IM is smaller compared to that of the conventional FBMC/QAM system as\nsome of the subcarriers are inactive. The performance of FBMC/QAM with IM is\ninvestigated by comparing the SIR and output SINR with that of the conventional\nFBMC/QAM system along with the BER performance which shows that the FBMC/QAM-IM\nis a promising transmission technique for future wireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 02:16:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 09:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 16:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

This early flotation crust would have formed\na thermal blanket over the remaining LMO, prolonging solidification.\nGeochronology of lunar anorthosites indicates a long timescale of LMO cooling,\nor re-melting and re-crystallization in one or more late events. To better\ninterpret this geochronology, we model LMO solidification in a scenario where\nthe Moon is being continuously bombarded by returning projectiles released from\nthe Moon-forming giant impact. More than one lunar mass of material escaped the\nEarth-Moon system onto heliocentric orbits following the giant impact, much of\nit to come back on returning orbits for a period of 100 Myr. If large enough,\nthese projectiles would have punctured holes in the nascent floatation crust of\nthe Moon, exposing the LMO to space and causing more rapid cooling. We model\nthese scenarios using a thermal evolution model of the Moon that allows for\nproduction (by cratering) and evolution (solidification and infill) of holes in\nthe flotation crust that insulates the LMO. For effective hole production,\nsolidification of the magma ocean can be significantly expedited, decreasing\nthe cooling time by more than a factor of 5. If hole production is inefficient,\nbut shock conversion of projectile kinetic energy to thermal energy is\nefficient, then LMO solidification can be somewhat prolonged, lengthening the\ncooling time by 50% or more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 02:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Its effectiveness is shown in various tasks,\nhowever, the lack of interpretability of the trained result by a layered neural\nnetwork has limited its application area.\n  In our previous studies, we proposed methods for extracting a simplified\nglobal structure of a trained layered neural network by classifying the units\ninto communities according to their connection patterns with adjacent layers.\nThese methods provided us with knowledge about the strength of the relationship\nbetween communities from the existence of bundled connections, which are\ndetermined by threshold processing of the connection ratio between pairs of\ncommunities.\n  However, it has been difficult to understand the role of each community\nquantitatively by observing the modular structure. We could only know to which\nsets of the input and output dimensions each community was mainly connected, by\ntracing the bundled connections from the community to the input and output\nlayers. Another problem is that the finally obtained modular structure is\nchanged greatly depending on the setting of the threshold hyperparameter used\nfor determining bundled connections.\n  In this paper, we propose a new method for interpreting quantitatively the\nrole of each community in inference, by defining the effect of each input\ndimension on a community, and the effect of a community on each output\ndimension.

We\npresent {\\mu}-cuDNN, a transparent wrapper library for cuDNN, which divides\nlayers' mini-batch computation into several micro-batches. Based on Dynamic\nProgramming and Integer Linear Programming, {\\mu}-cuDNN enables faster\nalgorithms by decreasing the workspace requirements. At the same time,\n{\\mu}-cuDNN keeps the computational semantics unchanged, so that it decouples\nstatistical efficiency from the hardware efficiency safely. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of {\\mu}-cuDNN over two frameworks, Caffe and TensorFlow,\nachieving speedups of 1.63x for AlexNet and 1.21x for ResNet-18 on P100-SXM2\nGPU. These results indicate that using micro-batches can seamlessly increase\nthe performance of deep learning, while maintaining the same memory footprint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 07:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

Our framework leverages numerical optimization to\ncompute trajectories that satisfy the system dynamics and require control\ninputs within the limits of the platform. Simultaneously, it optimizes\nperception objectives for robust and reliable sens- ing by maximizing the\nvisibility of a point of interest and minimizing its velocity in the image\nplane. Considering both perception and action objectives for motion planning\nand control is challenging due to the possible conflicts arising from their\nrespective requirements. For example, for a quadrotor to track a reference\ntrajectory, it needs to rotate to align its thrust with the direction of the\ndesired acceleration. However, the perception objective might require to\nminimize such rotation to maximize the visibility of a point of interest. A\nmodel-based optimization framework, able to consider both perception and action\nobjectives and couple them through the system dynamics, is therefore necessary.\nOur perception-aware model predictive control framework works in a\nreceding-horizon fashion by iteratively solving a non-linear optimization\nproblem.

Many memory allocators also\nimplement other API extensions, such as deriving the size of an allocated\nobject from the object's pointer, or calculating the base address of an\nallocation from an interior pointer. In this paper, we propose a general\npurpose extended allocator API built around these common extensions. We argue\nthat such extended APIs have many applications and demonstrate several use\ncases, such as (manual) memory error detection, meta data storage, typed\npointers and compact data-structures. Because most existing allocators were not\ndesigned for the extended API, traditional implementations are expensive or not\npossible.\n  Recently, the LowFat allocator for heap and stack objects has been developed.\nThe LowFat allocator is an implementation of the idea of low-fat pointers,\nwhere object bounds information (size and base) are encoded into the native\nmachine pointer representation itself. The \"killer app\" for low-fat pointers is\nautomated bounds check instrumentation for program hardening and bug detection.\nHowever, the LowFat allocator can also be used to implement highly optimized\nversion of the extended allocator API, which makes the new applications (listed\nabove) possible.

Our recovery approach is based on a simple convex program which\nuses the hinge loss function as data fidelity term. While such a risk\nminimization strategy is very natural to learn binary output models, such as in\nclassification, its capacity to estimate a specific signal vector is largely\nunexplored. A major difficulty is that the hinge loss is just piecewise linear,\nso that its \"curvature energy\" is concentrated in a single point. This is\nsubstantially different from other popular loss functions considered in signal\nestimation, e.g., the square or logistic loss, which are at least locally\nstrongly convex. It is therefore somewhat unexpected that we can still prove\nvery similar types of recovery guarantees for the hinge loss estimator, even in\nthe presence of strong noise.

A popular method for inference is\nthrough the posterior distribution, which is typically carried out by Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Most Gaussian processes can be represented\nas a Gaussian measure in a infinite dimensional space. This is an issue for\nstandard algorithms as they break down in an infinite dimensional setting, thus\nthe need for appropriate infinite dimensional samplers for implementing\nprobabilistic inference in such framework. In this paper, we introduce several\nadaptive versions of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL)\nalgorithm, which can be viewed as an infinite dimensional version of the well\nknown Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) algorithm for Gaussian\nprocesses. The basic premise for all our proposals lies in the idea of\nimplementing change of measure formulation to adapt the algorithms to greatly\nimprove their efficiency. A gradient-free version of pCNL is introduced, which\nis a hybrid of an adaptive independence sampler and an adaptive random walk\nsampler, and is shown to outperform the standard preconditioned Crank-Nicolson\n(pCN) scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm\nfor three different statistical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 09:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

In this study, the behaviours of the secular\nacceleration and underlying core dynamics are examined in new numerical\nsimulations of the geodynamo that reside on a theoretical path in parameter\nspace connecting the region where most classical models are found to the\nnatural conditions. The typical time scale for geomagnetic acceleration is\nfound to be invariant along this path, at a value close to 10 years that\nmatches Earth's core estimates. Despite this invariance, the spatio-temporal\nproperties of secular acceleration show significant variability along the path,\nwith an asymptotic regime of rapid rotation reached after 30% of this path\n(corresponding to a model Ekman number $E=3~10^{-7}$). In this regime, the\nenergy of secular acceleration is entirely found at periods longer than that of\nplanetary rotation, and the underlying flow acceleration patterns acquire a\ntwo-dimensional columnar structure representative of the rapid rotation limit.\nThe spatial pattern of the secular acceleration at the core-mantle boundary\nshows significant localisation of energy within an equatorial belt.

The observed station normals are\ninterpolated over a regular grid by applying a multi-linear local regression\nkriging (MLRK). The statistical method aims at modeling the influence of the\nmain geographical features, such as: latitude, longitude, elevation and sea\nnearness on the precipitation field at a local scale. The MLRK is composed of\ntwo steps, (i) a background precipitation field is computed through a\nmulti-linear local regression based on the geographical information, then (ii)\na kriging interpolation is applied to adjust the field so to better fit the\nstation residuals (i.e., the difference between the observed normals and the\nbackground field). The interpolation accuracy is evaluated by reconstructing\nthe station normals with a leave-one-out approach and by comparing the model\nperformances with those of other interpolation methods. The poor observation\ncoverage over remote and mountainous regions in Norway has motivated us to\nconsider precipitation fields produced by numerical models. In fact, numerical\nmodel output provides a reference field for the evaluation of MLRK that is not\ndependent on the station density, though it is not as accurate as the\nobservations. Specifically, a regional climate simulation with a resolution of\n2.5 km, based on the dynamical downscaling of the global reanalysis ERAInterim\nand available for the time period 2003-2016, has been used. In addition to the\nMLRK validation, the combination of numerical model fields and observed\nclimatologies has been investigated and the results show that this integrated\napproach provides more accurate high-resolution climatologies over the Country.\nThe numerical background introduces valuable information over remote and\nmountainous regions, whereas in-situ data correct for model biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 10:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

At the anatase (101) surface VOs are not stable; they migrate\ninto the bulk at temperatures above 200 K. Scanning a clean anatase (101)\nsurface at a sample bias greater than +4.3 V results in surface VOs in the\nscanned area, suggesting that subsurface VOs migrate back to the surface. To\ntest this hypothesis, surface VOs were first created through bombardment with\nenergetic electrons. The sample was then mildly annealed, which caused the VOs\nto move to the subsurface region, where they formed vacancy clusters. These VO\nclusters have various, distinct shapes. Scanning VO clusters with a high STM\nbias reproducibly converts them back into groupings of surface VO, with a\nconfiguration that is characteristic for each type of cluster. The dependence\nof the subsurface-to-surface VO migration on the applied STM bias voltage,\ntunneling current, and sample temperature was investigated systematically.

As a major building\nblock we use a dynamic LDD that we obtain by adapting the random-shift\nclustering of Miller et al. [SPAA 2013] to the dynamic setting. The major\ntechnical challenge in our approach is to control the propagation of updates\nwithin our hierarchy of LDDs: each update to one level of the hierarchy could\npotentially induce several insertions and deletions to the next level of the\nhierarchy. We achieve this goal by a sophisticated amortization approach.\n  We believe that the dynamic random-shift clustering might be useful for\nindependent applications. One of these applications is the dynamic spanner\nproblem. By combining the random-shift clustering with the recent spanner\nconstruction of Elkin and Neiman [SODA 2017]. We obtain a fully dynamic\nalgorithm for maintaining a spanner of stretch $ 2k - 1 $ and size $ O (n^{1 +\n1/k} \\log{n}) $ with amortized update time $ O (k \\log^2 n) $ for any integer $\n2 \\leq k \\leq \\log n $. Compared to the state-of-the art in this regime\n[Baswana et al. TALG '12], we improve upon the size of the spanner and the\nupdate time by a factor of $ k $.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 13:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 12:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 14:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

In this work, we aim\nto address the question of the possible long-term coexistence of a terrestrial\ncompanion on an orbit interior to a giant planet, and explore the extent of the\nstability regions for both non-resonant and resonant configurations. Our study\nfocuses on the restricted three-body problem, where an inner terrestrial planet\n(massless body) moves under the gravitational attraction of a star and an outer\nmassive planet on a circular or elliptic orbit. Using the Detrended Fast\nLyapunov Indicator as a chaotic indicator, we constructed maps of dynamical\nstability by varying both the eccentricity of the outer giant planet and the\nsemi-major axis of the inner terrestrial planet, and identify the boundaries of\nthe stability domains. Guided by the computation of families of periodic\norbits, the phase space is unravelled by meticulously chosen stable periodic\norbits, which buttress the stability domains. We provide all possible stability\ndomains for coplanar symmetric configurations and show that a terrestrial\nplanet, either in mean-motion resonance or not, can coexist with a giant\nplanet, when the latter moves on either a circular or an (even highly)\neccentric orbit. New families of symmetric and asymmetric periodic orbits are\npresented for the 2/1 resonance. It is shown that an inner terrestrial planet\ncan survive long time spans with a giant eccentric outer planet on resonant\nsymmetric orbits, even when both orbits are highly eccentric. For 22 detected\nsingle-planet systems consisting of a giant planet with high eccentricity, we\ndiscuss the possible existence of a terrestrial planet.

Particularly, fast controllable loads are utilized to restore system\nfrequency under changing power imbalance in an optimal manner. The imbalanced\npower causing frequency deviation is decomposed into three parts: a known\nconstant part, an unknown low-frequency variation and a high-frequency\nresidual. The known steady part is usually the prediction of power imbalance.\nThe variation may result from the fluctuation of renewable resources, electric\nvehicle charging, etc., which is usually unknown to operators. The\nhigh-frequency residual is usually unknown and treated as an external\ndisturbance. Correspondingly, in this paper, we resolve the following three\nproblems in different timescales: 1) allocate the steady part of power\nimbalance economically; 2) mitigate the effect of unknown low-frequency power\nvariation locally; 3) attenuate unknown high-frequency disturbances. To this\nend, a distributed controller combining consensus method with adaptive internal\nmodel control is proposed. We first prove that the closed-loop system is\nasymptotically stable and converges to the optimal solution of an optimization\nproblem if the external disturbance is not included. We then prove that the\npower variation can be mitigated accurately. Furthermore, we show that the\nclosed-loop system is robust against both parameter uncertainty and external\ndisturbances.

The\nobjective of this study is to propose a cost-effective approach for reducing\ndelay in the semi-actuated coordinated signal operation without incurring any\nextra costs in terms of installing new detectors or developing adaptive\ncontroller systems. We propose a simple approach for further enhancing a\npre-optimized timing plan. In this method, the green splits of non-coordinated\nphases are multiplied by a factor greater than one. In the meantime, the amount\nof green time added to the non-coordinated phases is subtracted from the\ncoordinated phases to keep the cycle length constant.

A regression analysis is implemented so as to\nidentify the optimal value of the mentioned factor, called Actuated Factor\n(ActF).

Here, we propose a method to automatically detect\nanatomical landmarks in medical images. Automatic landmark detection is\nperformed with a patch-based fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) that\ncombines regression and classification. For any given image patch, regression\nis used to predict the 3D displacement vector from the image patch to the\nlandmark. Simultaneously, classification is used to identify patches that\ncontain the landmark. Under the assumption that patches close to a landmark can\ndetermine the landmark location more precisely than patches farther from it,\nonly those patches that contain the landmark according to classification are\nused to determine the landmark location. The landmark location is obtained by\ncalculating the average landmark location using the computed 3D displacement\nvectors.

Our approach is inspired by the finger slip studies and\nadapts the idea of load-slip phenomenon that explains the movement of the soft\npart of the finger when dragged on a hard surface. We propose the concept of\nloading-distance and perform measurements on beef liver and chicken breast\ntissues. We propose a protocol to determine the loading-distance prior to an\nautomated scan and introduce an approach to compensate the tissue movement in\nraster scans. Our implementation and experiments show that we can have an\nimage-mosaic of the tissue surface in a desired rectangular shape with this\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 14:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-16"}

To address this problem,\nwe propose a deep convolutional Laplacian Pyramid Compressed Sensing Network\n(LapCSNet) for CS, which consists of a sampling sub-network and a\nreconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, we utilize a\nconvolutional layer to mimic the sampling operator.

The proposed LapCSNet not only integrates\nmulti-scale information to achieve better performance but also reduces\ncomputational cost dramatically.

We demonstrate that our problem can be\nreduced to minimizing a supermodular cost function subject to a matroid\nconstraint. This allows us to develop a greedy algorithm, for which we derive\nsub-optimality bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with\nsimulations on transport networks, where uncertain edge costs and uncertain\nnode positions lead to noisy travel time estimates. Comparisons to benchmark\nalgorithms show that our method performs near-optimally and significantly\nbetter than non-redundant assignment. Finally, our findings include results on\nthe benefit of diversity and complementarity in redundant robot coalitions;\nthese insights contribute towards providing resilience to uncertainty through\ntargeted robot team compositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 15:14:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 21:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

Here we\npresent dynamical models that reproduce these features of the stream in simple\nGalactic potentials. We find that debris at the apocenters must be dynamically\nyoung, in the sense of being stripped off in the last two pericentric passages,\nwhile the Sagittarius dwarf is currently experiencing a third passage. The\nratio of apocenters is sensitive to both dynamical friction and the outer slope\nof the Galactic rotation curve. These dependences can be understood with simple\nregularities connecting the apocentric radii, circular velocities, and orbital\nperiod of the progenitor. The effect of dynamical friction on the stream can be\nconstrained using substructure within the leading apocenter. Our ensembles of\nmodels are not intended as statistically proper fits to the stream.\nNevertheless, out of the range of models we consider, we consistently find the\nmass within 100 kpc to be $\\sim 7 \\times 10^{11} \\, M_{\\odot}$, with a nearly\nflat rotation curve between 50 and 100 kpc.

Hence, we ask\nif hypergraphs (hypernetworks), that directly capture entire complexes and\npathways along with protein-protein interactions (PPIs), carry additional\nfunctional information beyond what can be uncovered from networks of pairwise\nmolecular interactions. The mathematical formalism of a hypergraph has long\nbeen known, but not often used in studying molecular networks due to the lack\nof sophisticated algorithms for mining the underlying biological information\nhidden in the wiring patterns of molecular systems modelled as hypernetworks.\n  We propose a new, multi-scale, protein interaction hypernetwork model that\nutilizes hypergraphs to capture different scales of protein organization,\nincluding PPIs, protein complexes and pathways.

In this work, we present\nthe spatially region-weighted correlation ratio (SRWCR) as a novel similarity\nmeasure to improve the registration performance. Methods: SRWCR is rigorously\ndeduced from a three-dimension joint probability density function combining the\nintensity channels with an extra spatial information channel. SRWCR estimates\nthe optimal functional dependence between the intensities for each spatial bin,\nin which the spatial distribution modeled by a cubic B-spline function is used\nto differentiate the contribution of voxels. We also analytically derive the\ngradient of SRWCR with respect to the transformation parameters and optimize it\nusing a quasi-Newton approach. Furthermore, we propose a GPU-based parallel\nmechanism to accelerate the computation of SRWCR and its derivatives. Results:\nThe experiments on synthetic images, public 4-D thoracic computed tomography\n(CT) dataset, retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) data, and clinical CT\nand positron emission tomography (PET) images confirm that SRWCR significantly\noutperforms some state-of-the-art techniques such as spatially encoded mutual\ninformation and Robust PaTch-based cOrrelation Ration.

It captures the signals that are transmitted through the vocal folds,\nalong with the buzz tone of the larynx. Due to its skin contact, it is more\nrobust to the environmental noise compared to the acoustic microphone that\npicks up the vibrations through air pressure, and hence the all interventions.\nThe throat speech is partly intelligible, but gives unnatural and croaky sound.\nThis thesis tries to recover missing frequency bands of the throat speech and\ninvestigates envelope and excitation mapping problem with joint analysis of\nthroat- and acoustic-microphone recordings. A new phone-dependent GMM-based\nspectral envelope mapping scheme, which performs the minimum mean square error\n(MMSE) estimation of the acoustic-microphone spectral envelope, has been\nproposed. In the source-filter decomposition framework, we observed that the\nspectral envelope difference of the excitation signals of throat- and\nacoustic-microphone recordings is an important source of the degradation in the\nthroat-microphone voice quality. Thus, we also model spectral envelope\ndifference of the excitation signals as a spectral tilt vector, and propose a\nnew phone-dependent GMM-based spectral tilt mapping scheme to enhance throat\nexcitation signal. Experimental evaluations are performed to compare the\nproposed mapping scheme using both objective and subjective evaluations.\nObjective evaluations are performed with the log-spectral distortion (LSD) and\nthe wide-band perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) metrics.\nSubjective evaluations are performed with A/B pair comparison listening test.\nBoth objective and subjective evaluations yield that the proposed\nphone-dependent mapping consistently improves performances over the\nstate-of-the-art GMM estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 13:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

This may have been the case for one of the most ancient of all\nchromophores dissipating the Archean UVC photon flux, the nucleic acids. Under\nthe empirically established imperative of increasing entropy production,\nnucleic acids with affinity to particular amino acids which foment UVC photon\ndissipation would have been \"thermodynamically selected\" through this\ndissipation-replication relation. Indeed, we show here that those amino acids\nwith characteristics most relevant to fomenting UVC photon dissipation are\nprecisely those with greatest affinity to their codons or anticodons. This\ncould provide a physical-chemical mechanism for the accumulation of information\nin nucleic acids relevant to the dissipation of the externally imposed photon\npotential. This mechanism could provide a non-equilibrium thermodynamic\nfoundation, based on increasing global entropy production of the biosphere, for\nthe tenants of Darwinian natural selection. We show how this mechanism might\nhave begun operating at the origin of life in the Archean, and how, in fact, it\nstill operates today, albeit indirectly through complex biosynthetic pathways\nnow operating in the visible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 22:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}
