For a few\nsample particle densities and amplitudes of the periodic corrugation potential\nwe investigate the depinning from the statically pinned to the dynamically\nsliding regime. This sliding state exhibits the competition between a dynamics\nwhere entire clusters are pulled from a minimum to the next and a dynamics\nwhere single colloids or smaller groups leave a cluster and move across the\ncorrugation energy barrier to join the next cluster downstream in the force\ndirection. Both kinds of sliding states can occur either coherently across the\nentire sample, or asynchronously: the two regimes result in different average\nmobilities. Finite temperature tends to destroy separate sliding regimes,\ngenerating a smoother dependence of the mobility on the driving force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 16:03:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 14:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

In simple terms, our approach stipulates\napplying a second-order Taylor expansion to the value function to replace the\nBellman equation with one in continuous space and time where the transition\nmatrix is reduced to its first and second moments. In some cases, the resulting\nequation (which we label {\\bf TCP}) can be interpreted as corresponding to a\nBrownian control problem. When tractable, the TCP serves as a useful modeling\ntool.

We study how to do reactive synthesis when part of the\nspecification of the system is that its behavior should be random. Randomness\ncan be useful, for example, in a network protocol fuzz tester whose output\nshould be varied, or a planner for a surveillance robot whose route should be\nunpredictable. However, existing reactive synthesis techniques do not provide a\nway to ensure random behavior while maintaining functional correctness. Towards\nthis end, we generalize the recently-proposed framework of control\nimprovisation (CI) to add reactivity. The resulting framework of reactive\ncontrol improvisation provides a natural way to integrate a randomness\nrequirement with the usual functional specifications of reactive synthesis over\na finite window. We theoretically characterize when such problems are\nrealizable, and give a general method for solving them. For specifications\ngiven by reachability or safety games or by deterministic finite automata, our\nmethod yields a polynomial-time synthesis algorithm. For various other types of\nspecifications including temporal logic formulas, we obtain a polynomial-space\nalgorithm and prove matching PSPACE-hardness results.

There have been recent reassessments of the expected DM\ngamma-ray signals in case of long-range interactions, commonly known as\nSommerfeld enhancement. Since details of the underlying DM phase-space\ndistribution function become critical, there are potentially large\nuncertainties in the final result. We provide here a first attempt towards a\ncomprehensive investigation of these systematics, addressing the impact on the\nexpected DM flux from Milky Way dwarfs via Bayesian inference on the available\nstellar kinematic datasets. After reconsidering the study case of ergodic\nsystems, we investigate for the first time scenarios where DM particle orbits\nmay have a radial or tangential bias. We consider both cuspy and cored\nparametric DM density profiles, together with the case of a non-parametric halo\nmodelling directly connected to line-of-sight observable quantities. The main\nfindings of our work highlight the relevance of the assumed phase-space\ndistribution: Referring to a generalized J-factor, namely the line-of-sight\nconvolution of the spatial part in case of velocity-dependent annihilation\nrate, an enhancement (suppression) with respect to the limit of isotropic\nphase-space distributions is obtained for the case of tangentially (radially)\nbiased DM particle orbits. We provide new estimates for J-factors for the eight\nbrightest Milky Way dwarfs also in the limit of velocity-independent DM\nannihilation, in good agreement with previous results in literature, and derive\ndata-driven lower-bounds based on the non-parametric modelling of the halo\ndensity.

High-contrast exoplanet imaging is a rapidly growing field as can be\nseen through the significant resources invested. In fact, the detection and\ncharacterization of exoplanets through direct imaging is featured at all major\nground-based observatories. Aims. We aim to improve the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) achievable for ground-based, adaptive-optics assisted exoplanet imaging\nby applying sophisticated post-processing algorithms. In particular, we\ninvestigate the benefits of including time domain information. Methods. We\nintroduce a new speckle-suppression technique in data post-processing based on\nwavelet transformation. This technique explicitly considers the time domain in\na given data set (specifically the frequencies of speckle variations and their\ntime dependence) and allows us to filter-out speckle noise. We combine our\nwavelet-based algorithm with state-of-the-art principal component analysis\n(PCA) based PSF subtraction routines and apply it to archival data sets of\nknown directly imaged exoplanets. The data sets were obtained in the L filter\nwhere the short integration times allow for a sufficiently high temporal\nsampling of the speckle variations. Results. We demonstrate that improvements\nin the peak SNR of up to forty to sixty percent can be achieved. We also show\nthat, when combined with wavelet-denoising, the PCA PSF model requires\nsystematically smaller numbers of components for the fit to achieve the highest\nSNR. The improvement potential is, however, data set dependent or, more\nspecifically, closely linked to the field rotation available in a given data\nset: larger amounts of rotation allow for a better suppression of the speckle\nnoise. Conclusions. We have demonstrated that by applying advanced data\npost-processing techniques, the contrast performance in archival high-contrast\nimaging data sets can be improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 17:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

These planets,\nknown as ultra-short-period (USP) planets, are unlikely to have attained their\norbits in situ. Instead, they must have migrated in. Here we propose that these\nplanets reach their current orbits by high-eccentricity migration. In a\nscaled-down version of the dynamics that may have been experienced by their\nhigh mass analog, the hot Jupiters, these planets reach high eccentricities via\nchaotic secular interactions with their companion planets and then undergo\norbital circularization due to dissipation of tides raised on the planet. This\nproposal is motivated by the following observations: planetary systems observed\nby Kepler often contain several super-Earths with non-negligible eccentricities\nand inclinations, and possibly extending beyond AU distances; while only a\nsmall fraction of USP planets have known transiting companions, and none\nclosely spaced, we argue that most of them should have companions at periods of\n~10-50 days. The outer sibling planets, through secular chaos, can remove\nangular momentum from the inner most planet, originally at periods of ~5-10\ndays. When the latter reaches an eccentricity higher than 0.8, it is tidally\ncaptured by the central star and becomes an USP planet. This scenario naturally\nexplains the observation that most USP planets have significantly more distant\ntransiting companions compared to their counterparts at slightly longer periods\n(1-3 days), a feature un-accounted for in other proposed scenarios. Our model\nalso predicts that USP planets should have: (i) spin-orbit angles, and\ninclinations relative to outer planets, in the range of ~10-50 degrees; (ii)\nseveral outer planetary companions extending to beyond AU distances, both of\nwhich may be tested by TESS and its follow-up observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

It has been\npreviously shown that the solar shape exhibits asphericity that evolves with\nthe 11-year cycle. Thanks to the capability of the SoHO/MDI and SDO/HMI\ninstruments to observe with an unprecedented accuracy the surface gravity\noscillation (f) modes, it is possible to extract information concerning the\ncoefficients of rotational frequency splitting, a1, a3 and a5, that measure the\ndifferential rotation, together with the a2, a4 and a6 asphericity\ncoefficients. Analysis of these helioseismology data for almost two solar\ncycles, from 1996 to 2017, reveals a close correlation of the a1 and a5\ncoefficients with the solar activity, whilst a3 exhibits a long-term trend and\na weak correlation in the current cycle indicating a substantial change of the\nglobal rotation, potentially associated with a long-term evolution of the solar\ncycles. Looking in more details, the asphericity coefficients, a2, a4 and a6\nare more strongly associated with the solar cycle when applying a time lag of\nrespectively 0.1, 1.6 and -1.6 years. The magnitude of a6-coefficient varies in\nphase with the sunspot number (SN), but its amplitude is ahead of the SN\nvariation. The last measurements made in mid 2017 indicate that the magnitude\nof a6-coefficient has probably reached its minimum; therefore, the next solar\nminimum can be expected by the end of 2018 or in the beginning of 2019.

The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform other\nrelated learning methods in extensive experiments on several classification\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 19:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 12:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

This reality in no\nway diminishes the central role of geophysical phenomena in shaping planetary\noutcomes, from formation, to thermal and chemical evolution, to numerous issues\nof surface and near-surface habitability. We emphasize that for a balanced\nunderstanding of extrasolar planets, it is important to look beyond the natural\nbiases of current observing tools, and actively seek unique pathways to\nunderstand exoplanet interiors as best as possible during the long interim\nprior to a time when internal components are more directly accessible. Such\npathways include but are not limited to: (a) enhanced theoretical and numerical\nmodeling, (b) laboratory research on critical material properties, (c)\nmeasurement of geophysical properties by indirect inference from imprints left\non atmospheric and orbital properties, and (d) the purpose-driven use of Solar\nSystem object exploration expressly for its value in comparative planetology\ntoward exoplanet-analogs. Breaking down barriers that envision local Solar\nSystem exploration, including the study of Earth's own deep interior, as\nseparate from and in financial competition with extrasolar planet research, may\ngreatly improve the rate of needed scientific progress for exoplanet\ngeophysics. As the number of known rocky and icy exoplanets grows in the years\nahead, we expect demand for expertise in 'exogeoscience' will expand at a\ncommensurately intense pace. We highlight key topics, including: how water\noceans below ice shells may dominate the total habitability of our galaxy by\nvolume, how free-floating nomad planets may often attain habitable subsurface\noceans supported by radionuclide decay, and how deep interiors may critically\ninteract with atmospheric mass loss via dynamo-driven magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2018 19:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

They are already a standard in high-end computer animation and\ngraphics and are becoming available in a number of geometric modelling systems\nfor engineering design. The subdivision refinement rules are usually adapted\nfrom knot insertion rules for splines. The quadrilateral Catmull-Clark scheme\nconsidered in this work is equivalent to cubic B-splines away from\nextraordinary, or irregular, vertices with other than four adjacent elements.\nAround extraordinary vertices the surface consists of a nested sequence of\nsmooth spline patches which join $C^1$ continuously at the point itself. As\nknown from geometric design literature, the subdivision weights can be\noptimised so that the surface quality is improved by minimising\nshort-wavelength surface oscillations around extraordinary vertices. We use the\nrelated techniques to determine weights that minimise finite element\ndiscretisation errors as measured in the thin-shell energy norm. The\noptimisation problem is formulated over a characteristic domain and the errors\nin approximating cup- and saddle-like quadratic shapes obtained from\neigenanalysis of the subdivision matrix are minimised.

There have been many approaches to address the\neffects of scattering such as using pulsed laser sources to reject scattered\nlight temporally, or using intensity modulated waveforms and matched filters to\nremove the scattered light spectrally. In this paper, a new method is proposed\nwhich primarily uses the backscattering asymmetry property for object detection\nand geometric profiling. In our approach, two parallel and identical continuous\nwave (CW) laser beams with narrow beam widths (~2mm) are used as active\nillumination sources. The two beams also have controllable spacing and aiming\nangle, as well as initial phase difference for convenience of scanning and\nprofiling a target. Through theory and experimental results, it will be shown\nthat when an object leans or tilts towards one of the beam's central\ntrajectory, the asymmetry in the backscattered signals can be used to indicate\nthe location or slope of the target's surface, respectively. By varying the\nspacing or aiming angle of the two beams, a number of surface samples can be\ncollected to reconstruct the object's shape geometrically. The resolution and\nrange limit of our approach are also measured and reported in this work. In\napplication, our proposed method provides an economic solution to perform\nimaging through turbid underwater environments.

The first\nobjective of this work is to review and categorize the statistical\nmethodologies proposed in the literature to approximate the home range of an\nanimal, based on a sample of observed locations. The second aim is to address\nthe open question of choosing the \"best\" home range from a collection of them\nbased on the same sample.

Present understanding of the SSE is mainly based on a\nparticle-like picture with the local equilibrium approximation (LEA), i.e.,\nspatially resolved temperature-field assumed to describe the system. In this\nwork, we abandon the LEA to some extent and develop a wave theory to explain\nthe SSE, by highlighting the interplay between wave localization and\nturbulence.

On the other hand, the competing wave turbulence of\ninteracting magnons tends to delocalize the wave, and thus remarkably revives\nthe TSSE before the magnon self-trapping. Our theory provides a promising route\nto resolve the heated debate on TSSE with a clear experiment scheme to test it\nin future spin caloritronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 03:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

In\nmost simulations, P-W estimates of the ratio total mortality / growth (Z/K\nratio) were biased beyond acceptable limits (bias > 30%). Bias in Z/K showed a\ncomplex behavior, without possible corrections. Estimates of asymptotic length\n(Linf) were less biased than Z/K, but were very sensible to intra-cohort\nvariability in growth and to changes in the occurrence of large individuals in\nthe sample. Exclusion of the largest size classes during the regression\nprocedure or weighing by abundance does not solve these issues. Perfect\nlinearization of the data and absurdly narrow confidence intervals for Z/K will\nlead users to erroneous overconfidence in outputs. Clearly, the P-W method is\nnot suitable for the assessment of Z/K ratios of natural populations.\nEstimation of Linf may be tentatively possible under very specific conditions,\nwith necessary external verifications. Also, this study demonstrates that there\nis no way to estimate Linf directly from Lmax, since there is no particular\nrelationship to expect a priori between Linf and Lmax. Errors in estimating\nLinf directly affect the estimate of the growth constant K and all other\nsubsequent calculations in population studies, stock assessments and ecosystem\nmodels.

Our\nfindings indicate Li segregation at the surfaces, suggesting Li-rich grain\nboundaries at typical synthesis and sintering conditions. On the basis of our\nresults, we propose practical strategies to curb Li segregation at the\nLi$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$ interfaces. This approach can be extended to other\nLi-ion conductors for the design of practical energy storage devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 04:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

Here, we present a topology-based model to quantitively\ncharacterize correlation effects between mutations. The method is based on the\nmolecular dynamic simulations and the amino-acid network clique analysis that\nsimply examines if two single mutation sites belong to some 3-clique. We\nanalyzed 13 dual mutations of T4 phage lysozyme and found that the clique-based\nmodel successfully distinguishes highly correlated or non-additive double-site\nmutations from those with less correlation or additive mutations. We also\napplied the model to the protein Eglin c whose topology is significantly\ndistinct from that of T4 phage lysozyme, and found that the model can, to some\nextension, still identify non-additive mutations from additive ones. Our\ncalculations showed that mutation correlation effects may heavily depend on\ntopology relationship among mutation sites, which can be quantitatively\ncharacterized using amino-acid network k-cliques. We also showed that\ndouble-site mutation correlations can be significantly altered by exerting a\nthird mutation, indicating that more detailed physico-chemistry interactions\nmight be considered with the network model for better understanding of the\nelusive mutation-correlation principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 06:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

The Al2O3/MgAl2O4/MgO system provides an ideal model\nsystem for investigating the mechanisms underlying the migration of interfaces\nduring interface reaction. MgAl2O4 layers have been grown between Al2O3 and\nMgO, and the atomic structure of Al2O3/MgAl2O4 interfaces at different growth\nstages was characterized using aberration-corrected scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy. The oxygen sublattice transforms from hexagonal\nclose-packed (hcp) stacking in Al2O3 to cubic close-packed (ccp) stacking in\nMgAl2O4. Partial dislocations associated with steps are observed at the\ninterface. At the reaction-controlled early growth stages, such partial\ndislocations coexist with the edge dislocations. However, at the\ndiffusion-controlled late growth stages, such partial dislocations are\ndominant. The observed structures indicate that progression of the\nAl2O3/MgAl2O4 interface into Al2O3 is accomplished by the glide of partial\ndislocations accompanied by the exchange of Al3+ and Mg2+ cations. The\ninterface migration may be envisaged as a plane-by-plane zipper-like motion,\nwhich repeats along the interface facilitating its propagation. MgAl2O4 grains\ncan adopt two crystallographic orientations with a twinning orientation\nrelationship, and grow by dislocations gliding in opposite directions. Where\nthe oppositely propagating partial dislocations and interface steps meet,\ninterlinked twin boundaries and incoherent {\\Sigma}3 grain boundaries form. The\nnewly grown MgAl2O4 grains compete with each other, leading to a\ngrowth-selection and successive coarsening of the MgAl2O4 grains.

We test these on empirical temporal network data sets.\nThe greedy navigation is indeed more efficient than the reference strategies,\nmeaning that there are correlations in the real temporal networks that can be\nexploited. We find that the navigability for individual nodes is most strongly\ncorrelated with degree and burstiness, i.e., both topological and temporal\nstructures affect the navigation efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 13:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

We consider different types of couplings between the order\nparameters, including a bilinear one. This kind of coupling breaks\ntime-reversal symmetry and it is only allowed if both order parameters\ntransform according to the same irreducible representation. This occurs in many\nphysical systems of actual interest like competing spin density waves,\ndifferent types of orbital antiferromagnetism, elastic instabilities of crystal\nlattices, vortices in a multigap SC and also applies to describe the unusual\nmagnetism of the heavy fermion compound URu2Si2.

The motor is a container with asymmetric geometry; when\nfilling of gas, directional motion occurs if its temperature is different from\nthe environment. The essentially new mechanism is that the asymmetric geometry\nof the container may induce anisotropic thermalization, which results in a\ndensity gradient and propels the motor.

The interest in\nthis subclass stems from the fact that many problems which are NP-complete for\nchordal graphs are solvable in polynomial time for this subclass. However, we\nare not aware of any algorithm that can generate instances of this class, often\nnecessary for testing purposes. In this paper, we address this issue. Our\nalgorithm first generates chordal graphs, using an available algorithm and then\nadds enough edges to make it strongly chordal, unless it is already so. The\nedge additions are based on a totally balanced matrix characterizations of\nstrongly chordal graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 15:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Due\nto the complex topological structure of the energy Riemann surfaces close to an\nEP and the breakdown of the adiabatic theorem due to non-Hermiticity, the state\nevolution in non-Hermitian systems is much more complex than that in Hermitian\nsystems. For example, recent experimental work [Doppler et al. Nature 537, 76\n(2016)] demonstrated that dynamically encircling an EP can lead to chiral\nbehaviors, i.e., encircling an EP in different directions results in different\noutput states. Here, we propose a coupled ferromagnetic waveguide system that\ncarries two EPs and design an experimental setup in which the trajectory of\nstate evolution can be controlled in situ using a tunable external field,\nallowing us to dynamically encircle zero, one or even two EPs experimentally.\nThe tunability allows us to control the trajectory of encircling in the\nparameter space, including the size of the encircling loop and the starting/end\npoint. We discovered that whether or not the dynamics is chiral actually\ndepends on the starting point of the loop. In particular, dynamically\nencircling an EP with a starting point in the parity-time-broken phase results\nin non-chiral behaviors such that the output state is the same no matter which\ndirection the encircling takes. The proposed system is a useful platform to\nexplore the topology of energy surfaces and the dynamics of state evolution in\nnon-Hermitian systems and will likely find applications in mode switching\ncontrolled with external parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 03:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

In particular, MagNet consisting of an adversary\ndetector and a data reformer is by far one of the strongest defenses in the\nblack-box oblivious attack setting, where the attacker aims to craft\ntransferable adversarial examples from an undefended DNN model to bypass an\nunknown defense module deployed on the same DNN model. Under this setting,\nMagNet can successfully defend a variety of attacks in DNNs, including the\nhigh-confidence adversarial examples generated by the Carlini and Wagner's\nattack based on the $L_2$ distortion metric. However, in this paper, under the\nsame attack setting we show that adversarial examples crafted based on the\n$L_1$ distortion metric can easily bypass MagNet and mislead the target DNN\nimage classifiers on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also provide explanations on why\nthe considered approach can yield adversarial examples with superior attack\nperformance and conduct extensive experiments on variants of MagNet to verify\nits lack of robustness to $L_1$ distortion based attacks.
