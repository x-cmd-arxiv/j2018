If merging is a non-negligible factor in the\ngrowth of our Galaxy, evidence of such events should be encoded in its stellar\nhalo. Reliable identification of genuine halo stars is a challenging task\nhowever. The 1st Gaia data release contains the positions, parallaxes and\nproper motions for over 2 million stars, mostly in the Solar neighbourhood.\nGaia DR2 will enlarge this sample to over 1.5 billion stars, the brightest ~5\nmillion of which will have a full phase-space information. Our aim is to\ndevelop a machine learning model to reliably identify halo stars, even when\ntheir full phase-space information is not available. We use the Gradient\nBoosted Trees algorithm to build a supervised halo star classifier. The\nclassifier is trained on a sample extracted from the Gaia Universe Model\nSnapshot, convolved with the errors of TGAS, as well as with the expected\nuncertainties of the upcoming Gaia DR2. We also trained our classifier on the\ncross-match between the TGAS and RAVE catalogues, where the halo stars are\nlabelled in an entirely model independent way. We then use this model to\nidentify halo stars in TGAS. When full phase- space information is available\nand for Gaia DR2-like uncertainties, our classifier is able to recover 90% of\nthe halo stars with at most 30% distance errors, in a completely unseen test\nset, and with negligible levels of contamination. When line-of-sight velocity\nis not available, we recover ~60% of such halo stars, with less than 10%\ncontamination. When applied to the TGAS data, our classifier detects 337 high\nconfidence RGB halo stars. Although small, this number is consistent with the\nexpectation from models given the data uncertainties. The large parallax errors\nare the biggest limitation to identify a larger number of halo stars in all the\ncases studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 16:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 09:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

In this article, for both plasmonic and dielectric objects, we have\ndemonstrated a general way to control the reversal of near field binding force\nfor different shaped dimer sets.

Vehicles in an autonomous platoon\ncan exploit vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to collect information,\nsuch as velocity and acceleration, from surrounding vehicles so as to maintain\nthe target velocity and inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the dynamic\non-vehicle data processing rate and the uncertainty of the wireless channel,\nV2V communications within a platoon will experience a delay. Such delay can\nimpair the vehicles' ability to stabilize the operation of the platoon. In this\npaper, a novel framework is proposed to optimize a platoon's operation while\njointly consider the delay of the wireless network and the stability of the\nvehicle's control system. First, stability analysis for the control system is\nperformed and the maximum wireless system delay requirements which can prevent\nthe instability of the control system are derived. Then, delay analysis is\nconducted to determine the end-to-end delay, including queuing, processing, and\ntransmission delay for the V2V link in the wireless network. Subsequently,\nusing the derived delay, a lower bound and an approximated expression of the\nreliability for the wireless system, defined as the probability that the\nwireless system meets the control system's delay needs, are derived. Then, the\ncontrol parameters are optimized to maximize the derived wireless system\nreliability. Simulation results corroborate the analytical derivations and\nstudy the impact of parameters, such as the platoon size, on the reliability\nperformance of the vehicular platoon. More importantly, the simulation results\ndisclose the benefits of integrating control system and wireless network design\nwhile providing guidelines for designing autonomous platoons so as to realize\nthe required wireless network reliability and control system stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 00:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 01:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

Cell degradation cost\nbeing a non-linear model, its incorporation in an objective function alters the\nconvexity of the optimization problem and stochastic algorithms are required\nfor its solution. This paper builds on the scope for usage of macroscopically\nsemi-empirical models for degradation cost in economic dispatch problems and\nproves that these cost models derived from the existing semi-empirical capacity\nfade equations for LiFePO4 cells are convex under some operating condi-tions.\nThe proposed non-linear model was tested on two data sets of varying size which\nportray different trends of seasonality. The results show that the model\nreflects the trends of seasonality existing in the data sets and it mini-mizes\nthe total fuel cost globally when compared to conventional systems of economic\ndispatch. The results thus indicate that the model achieves a more accurate\nestimate of fuel cost in the system and can be effectively utilized for cost\nanalysis in power system applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 02:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

The Bose-Einstein\ncondensation of the Frenkel-type excitons allowed without spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking holds a key for understanding the unique pole structure and the\npseudogap through the instantaneous hybridization between the fractionalized\nquasiparticle and the dark fermion in analogy with the Mott gap.

We propose that the spin flip of\nHydrogen by the coherent emission/absorption of axions causes a lowering of\ntheir spin temperature and can explain the stronger than expected absorption of\n21-cm light reported by the EDGES collaboration. We find the analogy of axion\ninteraction with the two level HI with the Jaynes-Cummings model of a two level\natom in a cavity and we derive the spin flip frequency in this formalism and\nshow that the coherent oscillations frequency $\\Omega \\propto 1/f_a$ in\ncontrast with the incoherent transitions between the HI hyperfine levels where\nthe transition rates $\\propto 1/f_a^2$. The axion emission and absorption rates\nare equal but the spin temperature is still lowered due to different selection\nrules for the spin flip transitions compared to the photon process. We show\nthat the axion process goes in the right direction for explaining the EDGES\nobservation. For this mechanism to work we require a coherent field of\nrelativistic axions with energy $E_\\nu$ peaked at the 21-cm spin-flip energy.\nSuch a coherent background of relativistic axions can arise from the decay of\ncosmic strings if the decay takes place in the electroweak era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 08:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 10:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

One possibility is the geometric model, in which without the\nneed for intrinsic quasi-periodic variation, the relativistic Doppler factor\nchanges periodically, resulting in observed gamma-ray QPO. We propose a method\nto test this geometric model. We analyze the {\\it Fermi}-LAT data of PG\n1553+113 spanning from 2008 August until 2018 February. According to 29\nfour-month average spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the energy range of\n0.1-300 GeV, we split the {\\it Fermi}-LAT energy range into three bands: 0.1-1\nGeV, 1-10 GeV, and 10-300 GeV. The spectrum in each energy range can be\nsuccessfully fitted by a power-law. The light curves and photon indices in the\nthree energy ranges are obtained. Then, light curves in three narrow energy\nranges, i.e., 0.2-0.5 GeV, 2-5 GeV and 20- 40 GeV, are constructed, and the\nrelative variability amplitudes in the three narrow energy ranges are\ncalculated. A discrete-correlation analysis is performed for the light curves.\nOur results indicate that (i) the light curves in the different energy ranges\nfollow the same pattern showed in the light curve above 0.1 GeV; (ii) the three\ngroups of photon indices in the energy ranges of 0.1-1 GeV, 1-10 GeV, and\n10-300 GeV keep nearly constant; (iii) the ratio between relative variability\namplitudes in different narrow energy ranges are equal (within their errors) to\nthe prediction by the Doppler effect.

Optical technologies based on\nWavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) are gaining popularity for Data Center\nNetworks (DCNs) due to their technological strengths such as low communication\nlatency, low power consumption, and high link bandwidth. Therefore, it is worth\ninvestigating optical techniques into the BCube architecture for future DCNs.\nFor this purpose, we study the forwarding and optical indices in an all-optical\nBCube network. Consider an all-optical BCube network in which every host sets\nup a connection with every other host. The optical index is the minimum number\nof wavelengths required by the network to support such a host-to-host traffic,\nunder the restriction that each connection is assigned a wavelength that\nremains constant in the network. A routing is a set of directed paths specified\nfor all host pairs. By defining the maximum link load of a routing as the\nmaximum number of paths passing through any link, the forwarding index is\nmeasured to be the minimum of maximum link load over all possible routings. The\nforwarding index turns out to be a natural lower bound of the optical index. In\nthis paper, we first compute the forwarding index of an all-optical BCube\nnetwork. Then, we derive an upper bound of the optical index by providing an\noblivious routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) schemes, which attains the\nlower bound given by the forwarding index in some small cases. Finally, a\ntighter upper bound is obtained by means of the chromatic numbers in Graph\nTheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 13:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

Naturally, there is a compelling need to address nonsmoothness, the\nlack of strong convexity, and the presence of constraints. Accordingly, this\npaper presents a quasi-Newton framework that can process merely convex and\npossibly nonsmooth (but smoothable) stochastic convex problems. We propose a\nframework that combines iterative smoothing and regularization with a\nvariance-reduced scheme reliant on using increasing sample-sizes of gradients.\nWe make the following contributions. (i) We develop a regularized and smoothed\nvariable sample-size BFGS update (rsL-BFGS) that generates a sequence of\nHessian approximations and can accommodate nonsmooth convex objectives by\nutilizing iterative regularization and smoothing. (ii) In strongly convex\nregimes with state-dependent noise, the proposed variable sample-size\nstochastic quasi-Newton scheme admits a non-asymptotic linear rate of\nconvergence while the oracle complexity of computing an $\\epsilon$-solution is\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa^{m+1}/\\epsilon)$ where $\\kappa$ is the condition number and\n$m\\geq 1$. In nonsmooth (but smoothable) regimes, using Moreau smoothing\nretains the linear convergence rate. To contend with the possible\nunavailability of Lipschitzian and strong convexity parameters, we also provide\nsublinear rates; (iii) In merely convex but smooth settings, the regularized\nVS-SQN scheme rVS-SQN displays a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/k^{(1-\\varepsilon)})$.\nWhen the smoothness requirements are weakened, the rate for the regularized and\nsmoothed VS-SQN scheme worsens to $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/3})$.

This modality, however, is significantly more challenging than\noff-line ASR, since real-time/low-latency constraints inevitably hinder the use\nof future information, that is known to be very helpful to perform robust\npredictions. A popular solution to mitigate this issue consists of feeding\nneural acoustic models with context windows that gather some future frames.\nThis introduces a latency which depends on the number of employed look-ahead\nfeatures. This paper explores a different approach, based on estimating the\nfuture rather than waiting for it. Our technique encourages the hidden\nrepresentations of a unidirectional recurrent network to embed some useful\ninformation about the future. Inspired by a recently proposed technique called\nTwin Networks, we add a regularization term that forces forward hidden states\nto be as close as possible to cotemporal backward ones, computed by a \"twin\"\nneural network running backwards in time. The experiments, conducted on a\nnumber of datasets, recurrent architectures, input features, and acoustic\nconditions, have shown the effectiveness of this approach. One important\nadvantage is that our method does not introduce any additional computation at\ntest time if compared to standard unidirectional recurrent networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 15:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 01:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

The benefits using CFRP\ncomposites are due to their lightweight, high stiffness, as well as corrosion\nresistance. For this reason, there is a fast growing trend in using CFRP\ncomposites for aircraft and wind turbine structural applications. The\nreplacement of the conventional aerospace-grade metal alloys (aluminum,\ntitanium, magnesium, etc.) with CFRP composites results in new challenges. For\nexample, an aircraft during flight is prone to be struck by lightning. To\nwithstand the injection of such massive amount of energy, adequate electrical\nproperties, mainly electrical conductivity, is required. In fact, electrical\nconductance (or its reciprocal, resistance) is a critical parameter\nrepresenting any material change and it can be considered an index for health\nmonitoring. In this paper, AS4/8552 carbon/epoxy laminated composites were\ninjected with two types of electrical currents, impulse current and direct\ncurrent. The change in measured electrical resistance was recorded. A\nsignificant resistance drop occurred after electrical current injections.\nFurthermore, four-point flexural tests were performed on these composites to\ncorrelate an electrical resistance change with a potential flexural property\nchange. There was no clear trend between a resistance change and flexural\nstrength/modulus change of the test coupons, regardless of current injection.\nHowever, it was observed that the injection of the current affects the contact\nresistance such that its resistance decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2018 21:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}
