We develop an excursion-set method to generalise a\nrange of popular HMF fitting functions from GR to screened MG, considering the\nHMF dependence on the critical density parameter $\\delta_{c}$. In particular,\nwe propose a variety of new methods to account for the environmental dependence\nof chameleon screening and compare their accuracy to existing ones via $N$-body\ndata. Finally, using the nested sampling routine MultiNest, we examine two\npossible interpretations of the MG $N$-body results: whether they can be\ninterpreted as $\\Lambda$CDM HMFs and whether the MG HMFs display any\nuniversality.\n  We find that the effects of MG can be interpreted as a change in best-fit\nparameters in the $\\Lambda$CDM HMF---i.e. can be mistaken for GR---for all of\nthe fitting functions. Alternatively, the relation can be inverted to judge the\nuniversality of the HMF---not in terms of its purported invariance to $z$,\n$H_{0}$, $\\Omega_{m}$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ as in GR, but its independence on the\nunderlying theory of gravity. Although we found no completely universal HMF,\nthe parameter values did cluster according to the type of screening mechanism.\nThe results suggest that a single, best-fit HMF might be used for each type of\nscreening, independent of the parameters in the MG model. This demonstrates\nthat the additional complexity of the gravitational collapse in screened MG\ntheories cannot always be accounted for using the techniques developed in GR.\nHowever, the variations are small enough that it is unnecessary to develop new\nfitting functions and calibrate them on a case-by-case basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 17:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 10:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

A recent two-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulation studying the dynamical evolution of supernova ejecta\nwith a central energy source has revealed that outermost layers of the ejecta\nare accelerated to mildly relativistic velocities because of the breakout of a\nhot bubble driven by the energy injection. The outermost layers decelerate as\nthey sweep a circumstellar medium surrounding the ejecta, leading to the\nformation of the forward and reverse shocks propagating in the circumstellar\nmedium and the ejecta.

On the analytical\nfront, the situation is not much better; basic calculations, such as relating\nthe average rate of reversals to various core parameters, have apparently been\nintractable. Here, we present a framework for solving such problems. Starting\nwith the magnetic induction equation, we show that by considering its sources\nto be stochastic processes with fairly general properties, we can derive a\ndifferential equation for the joint probability distribution of the dominant\ntoroidal and poloidal modes. This can be simplified to a Fokker-Planck equation\nand, with the help of an adiabatic approximation, reduced even further to an\nequation for the dipole amplitude alone. From these equations various\nquantities related to the magnetic field, including the average reversal rate,\nfield strength, and time to complete a reversal, can be computed as functions\nof a small number of numerical parameters. These parameters in turn can be\ncomputed from physical considerations or constrained by paleomagnetic,\nnumerical, and experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 21:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-02"}

A pointer or robot starts\nat the origin of a maze and moves naturally between its vertices, according to\na finite or infinite sequence of specific instructions from the set of all\ncolours called an algorithm; if the robot is at a vertex for which there is no\nout-edge of the colour indicated by the instruction, it remains at that vertex\nand proceeds to execute the next instruction in the sequence. The central\nobject of study is the existence of algorithms that simultaneously solve, that\nis guide the robot to visit the destination in, certain large sets of mazes.\n  One of the most natural and interesting sets of mazes arises from the square\nlattice $\\Z^2$ viewed as a graph with arbitrarily many edges removed (each edge\ncorresponds to a pair of opposite directed edges), together with the suggestive\ncolouring that assigns to each directed edge the corresponding cardinal\ndirection.

The first episode was accompanied by the eruption of a mini-filament\nand the fast elongation motion of a thin circular ribbon (CR1) along the\ncounterclockwise direction at a speed of about 220 km/s. Two elongated\nspine-related ribbons were also observed, with the inner ribbon co-temporal\nwith CR1 and the remote brightenings forming ~20 s later.

We develop a convolutional-recursive\nauto-encoder comprised of structure parsing of a 2D image followed by structure\nrecovering of a cuboid hierarchy. The encoder is achieved by a multi-scale\nconvolutional network trained with the task of shape contour estimation,\nthereby learning to discern object structures in various forms and scales. The\ndecoder fuses the features of the structure parsing network and the original\nimage, and recursively decodes a hierarchy of cuboids. Since the decoder\nnetwork is learned to recover part relations including connectivity and\nsymmetry explicitly, the plausibility and generality of part structure recovery\ncan be ensured. The two networks are jointly trained using the training data of\ncontour-mask and cuboid structure pairs. Such pairs are generated by rendering\nstock 3D CAD models coming with part segmentation.

The\nkey to this problem is to trade accuracy for efficiency in an effective way,\ni.e. reducing the computing cost while maintaining competitive performance. To\nseek a good balance, previous efforts usually focus on optimizing the model\narchitectures. This paper explores an alternative approach, that is, to\nreallocate the computation over a scale-time space. The basic idea is to\nperform expensive detection sparsely and propagate the results across both\nscales and time with substantially cheaper networks, by exploiting the strong\ncorrelations among them. Specifically, we present a unified framework that\nintegrates detection, temporal propagation, and across-scale refinement on a\nScale-Time Lattice. On this framework, one can explore various strategies to\nbalance performance and cost.

For simplicity, we\nconsider a static and spherically symmetric system which is composed of\nconcentric infinitely thin shells. We calculate the fifth force profile by\nusing a numerical method for a relatively large Compton wavelength of the\nchameleon field. An approximate solution is also derived for the small Compton\nwavelength limit. Our results show that, if the thin-shell condition for the\ncorresponding smoothed density profile is satisfied, the fifth force is safely\nscreened outside the system irrespective of the configuration of the shells\ninside the system. In contrast to the screening outside the system, we find\nthat the fifth force can be comparable to the Newtonian gravitational force\ninside the system. If the system is highly inhomogeneous, the chameleon field\ncannot trace the potential minimum varying with the density and repeats being\nkicked, climbing up and rolling down the potential even when the effective mass\nof the chameleon field is sufficiently large in the system on average.

A current problem with performing\nanalyses of environmental recordings is interference from noise that can mask\nsounds of interest. This makes detecting these sounds more difficult and can\nrequire additional resources. While some work has been done to remove\nstationary noise from environmental recordings, there has been little effort to\nremove noise from non-stationary sources, such as rain, wind, engines, and\nanimal vocalisations that are not of interest.\n  In this paper, we address the challenge of filtering noise from rain and\ncicada choruses from recordings containing bird sound. We improve upon\npreviously established classification approaches using acoustic indices and Mel\nFrequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as acoustic features to detect these\nnoise sources, approaching the problem with the motivation of removing these\nsounds. We investigate the use of acoustic indices, and machine learning\nclassifiers to find the most effective filters.

Here, we focus on circulant-based SC codes.\nRecently, the optimal overlap (OO), circulant power optimizer (CPO) approach\nwas introduced to construct high performance SC codes for additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) and Flash channels. The OO stage operates on the\nprotograph of the SC code to derive the optimal partitioning that minimizes the\nnumber of graphical objects that undermine the performance of SC codes under\niterative decoding. Then, the CPO optimizes the circulant powers to further\nreduce this number. Since the nature of detrimental objects in the graph of a\ncode critically depends on the characteristics of the channel of interest,\nextending the OO-CPO approach to construct SC codes for channels with intrinsic\nmemory is not a straightforward task. In this paper, we tackle one relevant\nextension; we construct high performance SC codes for practical 1-D magnetic\nrecording channels, i.e., partial-response (PR) channels.

Planetesimals may continuously form\nfrom pebbles over the age of the protoplanetary disk by yet uncertain\nmechanisms. Meanwhile, large planetary embryos grow efficiently by accumulation\nof leftover pebbles that are not incorporated in planetesimals. Although this\nprocess, called pebble accretion, is offering a new promising pathway for\nformation of giant planets' cores, architectures of planetary systems formed\nthrough the process remain elusive. In the present paper, we perform\nsimulations of formation of planetary systems using a particle-based hybrid\ncode, to which we implement most of the key physical effects as precisely as\npossible. We vary the size of a protoplanetary disk, the turbulent viscosity,\nthe pebble size, the planetesimal formation efficiency, and the initial mass\ndistribution of planetesimals. Our simulations show that planetesimals first\ngrow by mutual collisions if their initial size is the order of $100$ km or\nless. Once planetesimals reach $\\sim$ 1000 km in size, they efficiently grow by\npebble accretion. If pebble supply from the outer region continues for a long\nperiod of time in a large protoplanetary disk, planetary embryos become massive\nenough to commence runaway gas accretion, resulting in gas giant planets. Our\nsimulations suggest that planetary systems like ours form from protoplanetary\ndisks with moderately high turbulent viscosities. If the disk turbulent\nviscosity is low enough, a planet opens up a gap in the gas disk and halts\naccretion of pebbles even before the onset of runway gas accretion. Such a disk\nproduces a planetary system with several Neptune-size planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 06:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

This\ncapability is especially apparent during driving: a human driver can recognize\nwhere they are when travelling in the reverse direction along a route for the\nfirst time, without having to turn back and look. The difficulty of this\nproblem exceeds any addressed in past appearance- and viewpoint-invariant\nvisual place recognition (VPR) research, in part because large parts of the\nscene are not commonly observable from opposite directions. Consequently, as\nshown in this paper, the precision-recall performance of current\nstate-of-the-art viewpoint- and appearance-invariant VPR techniques is orders\nof magnitude below what would be usable in a closed-loop system. Current\nengineered solutions predominantly rely on panoramic camera or LIDAR sensing\nsetups; an eminently suitable engineering solution but one that is clearly very\ndifferent to how humans navigate, which also has implications for how naturally\nhumans could interact and communicate with the navigation system. In this paper\nwe develop a suite of novel semantic- and appearance-based techniques to enable\nfor the first time high performance place recognition in this challenging\nscenario. We first propose a novel Local Semantic Tensor (LoST) descriptor of\nimages using the convolutional feature maps from a state-of-the-art dense\nsemantic segmentation network. Then, to verify the spatial semantic arrangement\nof the top matching candidates, we develop a novel approach for mining\nsemantically-salient keypoint correspondences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 07:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 02:48:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 10:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

We develop a theoretical\nframework for the specification and analysis of such systems that combines five\nsemantical notions: actual physical behaviour, measured behaviour, predicted\nbehaviour, computed behaviour and exceptional behaviour. Next, we consider the\nmore general and applicable situation of complex processes that exhibit several\ndistinct modes of physical behaviour. Thus, for their design, a set of\nmathematical models may be needed, each model having its own domain of\napplication and representing a particular mode of behaviour or operation of\nphysical reality with its own physical oracle. The models may be of disparate\nkinds and, furthermore, not all physical modes may even have a reliable model.\nWe address the questions: How do we specify algorithms and software that\nmonitor or govern a complex physical situation with many physical modes? How do\nwe specify a portfolio of modes, and the computational problem of transitioning\nfrom using one mode to another mode as physical behaviour changes? We propose a\ngeneral definition of an analogue-digital system with modes, and show how any\ndiverse set of modes, with or without models, can be bound together, and how\nthe transitions between modes can be determined, by constructing a data type\nand mode selection functions. We illustrate the ideas of physical modes and our\ntheory by reflecting on simple examples, including driverless racing cars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

The\nclassical approach involves selecting a smaller set of relevant sensor signals\nusing feature selection and using them to train a machine learning algorithm.\nHowever, this fails to address two prominent problems: (1) sensors are\nsusceptible to failure when exposed to extreme conditions over a long periods\nof time; (2) sensors are electrical devices that can be affected by noise or\nelectrical interference.

Subject to a genetic variant satisfying the instrumental\nvariable assumptions, an association between the variant and outcome implies a\ncausal effect of the exposure on the outcome. Complications arise with a binary\nexposure that is a dichotomization of a continuous risk factor (for example,\nhypertension is a dichotomization of blood pressure). This can lead to\nviolation of the exclusion restriction assumption: the genetic variant can\ninfluence the outcome via the continuous risk factor even if the binary\nexposure does not change. Provided the instrumental variable assumptions are\nsatisfied for the underlying continuous risk factor, causal inferences for the\nbinary exposure are valid for the continuous risk factor. Causal estimates for\nthe binary exposure assume the causal effect is a stepwise function at the\npoint of dichotomization. Even then, estimation requires further parametric\nassumptions. Under monotonicity, the causal estimate represents the average\ncausal effect in `compliers', individuals for whom the binary exposure would be\npresent if they have the genetic variant and absent otherwise. Unlike in\nrandomized trials, genetic compliers are unlikely to be a large or\nrepresentative subgroup of the population. Under homogeneity, the causal effect\nof the exposure on the outcome is assumed constant in all individuals; often an\nunrealistic assumption. We here provide methods for causal estimation with a\nbinary exposure (although subject to all the above caveats). Mendelian\nrandomization investigations with a dichotomized binary exposure should be\nconceptualized in terms of an underlying continuous variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

This may partially be due to the\nfact that controlling an MC system at microscale is quite challenging. To link\nthe macroworld to the microworld, we propose a biological signal conversion\ninterface that can also be seen as a microscale modulator. This interface\ntranslates an optical signal, which can be easily controlled using a\nlight-emitting diode (LED), into a chemical signal by changing the pH of the\nenvironment. The modulator is realized using \\textit{Escherichia coli} bacteria\nthat express the light-driven proton pump gloeorhodopsin from\n\\textit{Gloeobacter violaceus}. Upon inducing external light stimuli, these\nbacteria can locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting protons\ninto the environment. Based on measurement data from a testbed, we develop an\nanalytical model for the induced chemical signal as a function of the applied\noptical signal. Finally, using a pH sensor as detector, we show for an example\nscenario that the proposed setup is able to successfully convert an optical\nsignal representing a sequence of binary symbols into a chemical signal with a\nbit rate of $1$~bit/min.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

The improved method, which we call SPSA-FSR, dramatically reduces the\nnumber of iterations required for convergence without impacting solution\nquality. SPSA-FSR can be used for feature ranking and feature selection both\nfor classification and regression problems. After a review of the current\nstate-of-the-art, we discuss our improvements in detail and present three sets\nof computational experiments: (1) comparison of SPSA-FS as a (wrapper) feature\nselection method against sequential methods as well as genetic algorithms, (2)\ncomparison of SPSA-FS as a feature ranking method in a classification setting\nagainst random forest importance, chi-squared, and information main methods,\nand (3) comparison of SPSA-FS as a feature ranking method in a regression\nsetting against minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), RELIEF, and linear\ncorrelation methods. The number of features in the datasets we use range from a\nfew dozens to a few thousands. Our results indicate that SPSA-FS converges to a\ngood feature set in no more than 100 iterations and therefore it is quite fast\nfor a wrapper method. SPSA-FS also outperforms popular feature selection as\nwell as feature ranking methods in majority of test cases, sometimes by a large\nmargin, and it stands as a promising new feature selection and ranking method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 10:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

The latter has been predicted to arise for a Coulomb-blockaded\nmesoscopic topological superconductor (Majorana box), where at least three\nnormal leads are tunnel-coupled to different Majorana zero modes on the box.\nThe Majorana states represent a quantum impurity spin that is partially\nscreened due to cotunneling processes between leads, with a stable non-Fermi\nliquid ground state. Our theory studies a generalization where (i) Majorana\nstates are replaced by topologically protected parafermionic zero modes, (ii)\ncharging effects again define a spin-like quantum impurity on the resulting\nparafermion box, and (iii) normal leads are substituted by fractional edge\nstates. In this multi-terminal problem, different fractional edge leads couple\nonly via the parafermion box. We show that although the linear conductance\ntensor exhibits similar behavior as in the Majorana case, both at weak and\nstrong coupling, our parafermionic generalization is actually not a Kondo\nproblem but defines a rich new class of quantum impurity problems. At the\nstrong-coupling fixed point, a current injected through a reference lead will\nbe isotropically partitioned into outgoing currents in all other leads,\ntogether with a universal negative current scattered into the reference lead.\nThe device can thus be operated as current extractor, where the current\npartitioning is noiseless at the fixed point. We describe a fractional quantum\nHall setup proximitized by superconductors and ferromagnets, which could allow\nfor an experimental realization in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 11:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 08:37:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 14:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

The interplay between these terms gives\nrise to non-monotonic dependence of the radius of gyration, $R_g$ on the\ninverse Debye length, $\\kappa$ when PA effects are important (${\\frac{\\delta\n\\sigma}{\\sigma}} > 1$).

This makes it possible for the system to track not only\ncorners, but any pixels with large enough intensity gradients. IMU information\nis accumulated between several frames using measurement preintegration, and is\ninserted into the optimization as an additional constraint between keyframes.\nWe explicitly include scale and gravity direction into our model and jointly\noptimize them together with other variables such as poses. As the scale is\noften not immediately observable using IMU data this allows us to initialize\nour visual-inertial system with an arbitrary scale instead of having to delay\nthe initialization until everything is observable. We perform partial\nmarginalization of old variables so that updates can be computed in a\nreasonable time.

This has also led to doubts over the claimed\nconnection between the NPS and Fermi Bubbles (FBs). I show in this paper, that\nsuch asymmetries of NPS and Loop-I in both X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays can be\neasily produced if the circumgalactic medium (CGM) density in the southern\nhemisphere is only smaller by $\\approx 20\\%$ than the northern counterpart in\ncase of a star formation driven wind scenario.

One of the main\nreasons for the asymmetry is the projection effects at the Solar location. Such\na proposition is also consistent with the fact that the southern FB is $\\approx\n5^\\circ$ bigger than the northern one. The results, therefore, indicate towards\na possibility for a common origin of the NPS, Loop-I and FBs from the Galactic\ncentre (GC).

The best-fitting random shapes\nresemble each other, and we suggest their average approximates the shape of the\nsilhouette at the time of the occultation. The effective diameter obtained for\nPalma, 192.1+-4.8 km, is in excellent agreement with recent estimates from\nthermal modeling of mid-infrared photometry. Finally, our computations show\nthat because of the high positional accuracy, a single radio interferometric\noccultation measurement can reduce the long-term ephemeris uncertainty by an\norder of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 12:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 09:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Then, from each stroke, we\nextract a set of static and dynamic features from new proposed model that we\ncalled Extended Beta-Elliptic model and from the Fuzzy Elementary Perceptual\nCodes. Next, all the segments which are composed of N consecutive strokes are\ncategorized into groups and subgroups according to their position and their\ngeometric characteristics. Finally, Deep Neural Network is used as classifier.\nExperimental results reveal that the proposed system achieves interesting\nresults as compared to those of the existing writer identification systems on\nLatin and Arabic scripts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 16:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 19:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2018 11:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

To be effective, a policy has to\nconsider a broad range of elements, such as pollution emission, traffic flow,\nand human mobility. Due to the complexity and variability of these elements in\nthe urban area, to produce effective policies remains a very challenging task.\nWith the introduction of the smart city paradigm, a widely available amount of\ndata can be generated in the urban spaces. Such data can be a fundamental\nsource of knowledge to improve policies because they can reflect the\nsustainability issues underlying the city. In this context, we propose an\napproach to exploit urban positioning data based on stigmergy, a bio-inspired\nmechanism providing scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. By employing\nstigmergy, samples in proximity with each other are aggregated into a\nfunctional structure called trail. The trail summarizes relevant dynamics in\ndata and allows matching them, providing a measure of their similarity.\nMoreover, this mechanism can be specialized to unfold specific dynamics.\nSpecifically, we identify high-density urban areas (i.e hotspots), analyze\ntheir activity over time, and unfold anomalies. Moreover, by matching activity\npatterns, a continuous measure of the dissimilarity with respect to the typical\nactivity pattern is provided. This measure can be used by policy makers to\nevaluate the effect of policies and change them dynamically. As a case study,\nwe analyze taxi trip data gathered in Manhattan from 2013 to 2015.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 15:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

The linear nature of\ngenome wide association studies (GWAS) used to identify associations between\ngenetic variants and the phenotype have had limited success in explaining the\nheritability variation of BMI and shown low predictive capacity in\nclassification studies.

However, for perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs), non-radiative\ncharge carrier recombination has limited electroluminescence (EL) efficiency.\nHere we demonstrate perovskite-polymer bulk heterostructure LEDs exhibiting\nrecord-high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 20%, and an EL\nhalf-life of 46 hours under continuous operation. This performance is achieved\nwith an emissive layer comprising quasi-2D and 3D perovskites and an insulating\npolymer. Transient optical spectroscopy reveals that photogenerated excitations\nat the quasi-2D perovskite component migrate to lower-energy sites within 1 ps.\nThe dominant component of the photoluminescence (PL) is primarily bimolecular\nand is characteristic of the 3D regions. From PL quantum efficiency and\ntransient kinetics of the emissive layer with/without charge-transport\ncontacts, we find non-radiative recombination pathways to be effectively\neliminated. Light outcoupling from planar LEDs, as used in OLED displays,\ngenerally limits EQE to 20-30%, and we model our reported EL efficiency of over\n20% in the forward direction to indicate the internal quantum efficiency (IQE)\nto be close to 100%. Together with the low drive voltages needed to achieve\nuseful photon fluxes (2-3 V for 0.1-1 mA/cm2), these results establish that\nperovskite-based LEDs have significant potential for light-emission\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2018 22:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}
