The present theory\nlends itself to quantify both quantum non-Gaussianity and Wigner negativity as\nresources, depending on the choice of the free-state set --- i.e., the convex\nhull of Gaussian states or the states with positive Wigner function,\nrespectively. After showing that the theory admits no maximally resourceful\nstate, we define a computable resource monotone --- the Wigner logarithmic\nnegativity. We use the latter to assess the resource content of experimentally\nrelevant states --- e.g., photon-added, photon-subtracted, cubic-phase, and cat\nstates --- and to find optimal working points of some resource concentration\nprotocols. We envisage applications of this framework to sub-universal and\nuniversal quantum information processing over continuous variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 16:05:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 17:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Many MR brain image processing techniques, such\nas tissue segmentation, require multiple MR contrasts as inputs, and each\ncontrast is treated differently. Thus it is advantageous to automate the\nidentification of image contrasts for various purposes, such as facilitating\nimage processing pipelines, and managing and maintaining large databases via\ncontent-based image retrieval (CBIR). Most automated CBIR techniques focus on a\ntwo-step process: extracting features from data and classifying the image based\non these features. We present a novel 3D deep convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based method for MR image contrast classification. The proposed CNN\nautomatically identifies the MR contrast of an input brain image volume.\nSpecifically, we explored three classification problems: (1) identify\nT1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery\n(FLAIR) contrasts, (2) identify pre vs post-contrast T1, (3) identify pre vs\npost-contrast FLAIR. A total of 3418 image volumes acquired from multiple sites\nand multiple scanners were used. To evaluate each task, the proposed model was\ntrained on 2137 images and tested on the remaining 1281 images.

The Neighborhood Activation Model\n(NAM~\\cite{Luce:1986,Luce:1998}) posits that phonological neighbors (two forms\n[words] that differ by one phoneme) compete significantly for recognition as a\nspoken word is heard. This definition of phonological similarity can be\nextended to an entire corpus of forms to produce a phonological neighbor\nnetwork~\\cite{Vitevitch:2008} (PNN). We study PNNs for five languages: English,\nSpanish, French, Dutch, and German. Consistent with previous work, we find that\nthe PNNs share a consistent set of topological features. Using an approach that\ngenerates random lexicons with increasing levels of phonological realism, we\nshow that even random forms with minimal relationship to any real language,\ncombined with only the empirical distribution of language-specific phonological\nform lengths, are sufficient to produce the topological properties observed in\nthe real language PNNs. The resulting pseudo-PNNs are insensitive to the level\nof lingusitic realism in the random lexicons but quite sensitive to the shape\nof the form length distribution. We therefore conclude that \"universal\"\nfeatures seen across multiple languages are really string universals, not\nlanguage universals, and arise primarily due to limitations in the kinds of\nnetworks generated by the one-step neighbor definition. Taken together, our\nresults indicate that caution is warranted when linking the dynamics of human\nspoken word recognition to the topological properties of PNNs, and that the\ninvestigation of alternative similarity metrics for phonological forms should\nbe a priority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 16:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Despite its ubiquitous nature, this formulation of\nmotion planning has received relatively little theoretical investigation, as\nopposed to the setup where the environment is assumed known. A fundamental\nchallenge is that, unlike motion planning with known obstacles, it is not even\nclear what an optimal policy to strive for is. Our contribution is threefold.\nFirst, we present a notion of optimality for safe planning in unknown\nenvironments in the spirit of comparative (as opposed to competitive) analysis,\nwith the goal of obtaining a benchmark that is, at least conceptually,\nattainable. Second, by leveraging this theoretical benchmark, we derive a\npseudo-optimal class of policies that can seamlessly incorporate any amount of\nprior or learned information while still guaranteeing the robot never collides.\nFinally, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithmic approach in\nnumerical experiments using a range of environment types and dynamics,\nincluding a comparison with a state of the art method.

In an SCMA system, designing multidimensional constellation plays an\nimportant role in the performance of the system. Since the behaviour of\nmultidimensional constellations highly depends on the type of the channel, it\nis crucial to employ a constellation that is suitable for a certain\napplication. In this paper, we first highlight and review the key performance\nindicators (KPIs) of multidimensional constellations that should be considered\nin their design process for various channel scenarios. We then provide a survey\non the known multidimensional constellations in the context of SCMA systems\nwith their design criteria. The performance of some of those constellations are\nevaluated for uncoded, high-rate, and low-rate LTE turbo-coded SCMA systems\nunder different channel conditions through extensive simulations. All\nturbo-coded comparisons are performed for bit-interleaved coded modulation,\nwith a concatenated detection and decoding scheme. Simulation results confirm\nthat multidimensional constellations that satisfy KPIs of a certain channel\nscenario outperform others. Moreover, the bit error rate performance of uncoded\nsystems, and the performance of the coded systems are coupled to their\nbit-labeling. The performance of the systems also remarkably depends on the\nbehavior of the multi-user detector at different signal-to-noise ratio regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 17:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 01:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Accurate modeling of this temporal\nevolution can help solve complex tasks involving real-life social and\ninteraction networks. However, existing models for learning latent\nrepresentation are inadequate for obtaining the representation vectors of the\nvertices for different time-stamps of a dynamic network in a meaningful way. In\nthis paper, we propose latent representation learning models for dynamic\nnetworks which overcome the above limitation by considering two different kinds\nof temporal smoothness: (i) retrofitted, and (ii) linear transformation. The\nretrofitted model tracks the representation vector of a vertex over time,\nfacilitating vertex-based temporal analysis of a network. On the other hand,\nlinear transformation based model provides a smooth transition operator which\nmaps the representation vectors of all vertices from one temporal snapshot to\nthe next (unobserved) snapshot-this facilitates prediction of the state of a\nnetwork in a future time-stamp. We validate the performance of our proposed\nmodels by employing them for solving the temporal link prediction task.\nExperiments on 9 real-life networks from various domains validate that the\nproposed models are significantly better than the existing models for\npredicting the dynamics of an evolving network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 17:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

Recently, there\nhas been growing interest in investigating the role of homeostatic plasticity\nmechanisms, across different spatiotemporal scales, in regulating network\nactivity and brain functioning against a wide range of environmental conditions\nand brain states (e.g., during learning, development, ageing, neurological\ndiseases). In the present study, we investigate how the inclusion of\nhomeostatic plasticity in a stochastic whole-brain model, implemented as a\nnormalization of the incoming node's excitatory input, affects the macroscopic\nactivity during rest and the formation of functional networks. Importantly, we\naddress the structure-function relationship both at the group and\nindividual-based levels. In this work, we show that normalization of the node's\nexcitatory input improves the correspondence between simulated neural patterns\nof the model and various brain functional data. Indeed, we find that the best\nmatch is achieved when the model control parameter is in its critical value and\nthat normalization minimizes both the variability of the critical points and\nneuronal activity patterns among subjects. Therefore, our results suggest that\nthe inclusion of homeostatic principles lead to more realistic brain activity\nconsistent with the hallmarks of criticality.

We focus on type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) driven\nby collisions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs). Such collisions can\narise from several channels: (1) collisions due to extremely high\neccentricities induced by secular evolution, (2) collisions following a\ndynamical instability of the system, and (3) collisions driven by semisecular\nevolution.

In this paper we model the observed\nsize-luminosity relationship of the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of AGN. We model\nthe NLR as a collection of clouds in pressure equilibrium with the ionizing\nradiation, with each cloud producing line emission calculated by Cloudy. The\nsizes of the NLRs of powerful quasars are reproduced without any free\nparameters, as long as they contain massive ($10^5 - 10^7 M_\\odot$)\nionization-bounded clouds. At lower AGN luminosities the observed sizes are\nlarger than the model sizes, likely due to additional unmodeled sources of\nionization (e.g., star formation).

This statement has been proven for local bulk operators. In this paper,\nspecializing first for simplicity to a Rindler wedge of AdS$_3$, we find that\ngeneric curves within the wedge are in fact not fully reconstructible with\nentanglement entropies in the corresponding boundary region, even after using\nthe most general variant of hole-ography, which was recently shown to suffice\nfor reconstruction of arbitrary spacelike curves in the Poincare patch. This\nlimitation is an analog of the familiar phenomenon of entanglement shadows,\nwhich we call 'entanglement shade'. We overcome it by showing that the\ninformation about the nonreconstructible curve segments is encoded in a slight\ngeneralization of the concept of entanglement of purification, whose\nholographic dual has been discussed very recently. We introduce the notion of\n'differential purification', and demonstrate that, in combination with\ndifferential entropy, it enables the complete reconstruction of all spacelike\ncurves within an arbitrary entanglement wedge in any 3-dimensional bulk\ngeometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 14:46:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2018 16:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

Age-dating these galaxies\nis, however, a difficult task, and even a small contribution of an underlying\nyoung stellar population could, in principle, affect the age estimate and its\ncosmological interpretation. We present several spectral indicators to detect,\nquantify and constrain such contamination in old galaxies, and study how their\ncombination can be used to maximize the purity of cosmic chronometers\nselection. In particular, we analyze the CaII H/K ratio, the presence (or\nabsence) of H$\\alpha$ and [OII] emission lines, higher order Balmer absorption\nlines, and UV flux; each indicator is especially sensitive to a particular age\nrange, allowing us to detect young components ranging between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr.\nThe combination of these indicators minimizes the contamination to a level\nbelow 1% in the case of ideal data. More importantly, it offers a way to\ncontrol the systematic error on $H(z)$ as a function of the contamination by\nyoung stellar populations.

With a k-means clustering algorithm a throughput per region\n(i.e., cluster) can be calculated, leading to what we refer to as\n\"area-throughput\". For evaluating the proposed orthogonality clustering scheme\nwe use a simple filtered MIMO channel model which is spatially consistent, with\nknown degrees of freedom.

It has been shown that\nthe execution times of MapReduce jobs are often adversely impacted by a few\nslow tasks, known as stragglers, which result in high latency and deadline\nviolations. While a number of strategies have been developed in existing work\nto mitigate stragglers by launching speculative or clone task attempts, none of\nthem provides a quantitative framework that optimizes the speculative execution\nfor offering guaranteed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to meet application\ndeadlines. In this paper, we bring several speculative scheduling strategies\ntogether under a unifying optimization framework, called Chronos, which defines\na new metric, Probability of Completion before Deadlines (PoCD), to measure the\nprobability that MapReduce jobs meet their desired deadlines. We systematically\nanalyze PoCD for popular strategies including Clone, Speculative-Restart, and\nSpeculative-Resume, and quantify their PoCD in closed-form. The result\nilluminates an important tradeoff between PoCD and the cost of speculative\nexecution, measured by the total (virtual) machine time required under\ndifferent strategies. We propose an optimization problem to jointly optimize\nPoCD and execution cost in different strategies, and develop an algorithmic\nsolution that is guaranteed to be optimal.

ATM\nsystems rely on the interconnectivity of components made possible by wired\nand/or wireless networks. Unfortunately, this connectivity that supports ATM\nsystems also provides potential system access points that results in\nvulnerability to cyberattacks. This is becoming more pronounced as ATM systems\nbegin to integrate internet of things (IoT) devices. Hence, there is a need to\nrigorously evaluate ATM systems for cyberattack vulnerabilities, and explore\ndesign concepts that provide stability and graceful degradation in the face of\ncyberattacks. In this research, a prototype ATM system along with a real-time\ncyberattack monitoring system were developed for a 1.5-mile section of I-66 in\nNorthern Virginia. The monitoring system detects deviation from expected\noperation of an ATM system by comparing lane control states generated by the\nATM system with lane control states deemed most likely by the monitoring\nsystem. In case of any deviation between two sets of states, the monitoring\nsystem displays the lane control states generated by the back-up data source.\nIn a simulation experiment, the prototype ATM system and cyberattack monitoring\nsystem were subject to emulated cyberattacks. The evaluation results showed\nthat when subject to cyberattack, the mean speed reduced by 15% compared to the\ncase with the ATM system and was similar to the baseline case. This illustrates\nthat the effectiveness of the ATM system was negated by cyberattacks.

We first review data\nthat shows the core density of a galaxy $\\rho_c$ varies as a function of the\ncore radius $R_c$ as $\\rho_c\\propto1/R_c^\\beta$ with $\\beta\\approx1$. We then\ncompare this to theoretical models. We examine a large class of light scalar\ndark matter models, governed by some potential $V$. For simplicity, we take the\nscalar to be complex with a global $U(1)$ symmetry in order to readily organize\nsolutions by a conserved particle number. However, we expect our central\nconclusions to persist even for a real scalar, and furthermore, a complex\nscalar matches the behavior of a real scalar in the non-relativistic limit,\nwhich is the standard regime of interest. For any potential $V$, we find the\nrelationship between $\\rho_c$ and $R_c$ for ground state solutions is always in\none of the following regimes: (i) $\\beta\\gg1$, or (ii) $\\beta\\ll1$, or (iii)\nunstable, and so it never matches the data. We also find similar conclusions\nfor virialized dark matter, more general scalar field theories, degenerate\nfermion dark matter, superfluid dark matter, and general polytropes. We\nconclude that the solution to the core-cusp problem is more likely due to\neither complicated baryonic effects or some other type of dark matter\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 20:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

A variety\nof methods has been explored to debias click data for learning to rank such as\nclick models, result interleaving and, more recently, the unbiased\nlearning-to-rank framework based on inverse propensity weighting. Despite their\ndifferences, most existing studies separate the estimation of click bias\n(namely the \\textit{propensity model}) from the learning of ranking algorithms.\nTo estimate click propensities, they either conduct online result\nrandomization, which can negatively affect the user experience, or offline\nparameter estimation, which has special requirements for click data and is\noptimized for objectives (e.g. click likelihood) that are not directly related\nto the ranking performance of the system.

The model distributes the cohesive forces over a\nthin shell surrounding each particle, thereby allowing for the spatial and\ntemporal resolution of the cohesive forces during particle-particle\ninteractions. The influence of the cohesive forces is captured by a single\ndimensionless parameter in the form of a cohesion number, which represents the\nratio of cohesive and gravitational forces acting on a particle. We test and\nvalidate the cohesive force model for binary particle interactions in the\nDrafting-Kissing-Tumbling (DKT) configuration. The DKT simulations demonstrate\nthat cohesive particle pairs settle in a preferred orientation, with particles\nof very different sizes preferentially aligning themselves in the vertical\ndirection, so that the smaller particle is drafted in the wake of the larger\none. To test this mechanism in a system of higher complexity, we perform large\nsimulations of 1,261 polydisperse settling particles starting from rest. These\nsimulations reproduce several earlier experimental observations by other\nauthors, such as the accelerated settling of sand and silt particles due to\nparticle bonding. The simulations demonstrate that cohesive forces accelerate\nthe overall settling process primarily because smaller grains attach to larger\nones and settle in their wakes. For the present cohesion number values, we\nobserve that settling can be accelerated by up to 29%. We propose physically\nbased parametrization of classical hindered settling functions proposed by\nearlier authors, in order to account for cohesive forces.

The former is called a\ntransition-based reward function, whereas the latter is called a state-based\nreward function. When the objective involves the expected cumulative reward\nonly, this simplification works perfectly. However, when the objective is\nrisk-sensitive, this simplification leads to an incorrect value. We present\nstate-augmentation transformations (SATs), which preserve the reward sequences\nas well as the reward distributions and the optimal policy in risk-sensitive\nreinforcement learning. In risk-sensitive scenarios, firstly we prove that, for\nevery MDP with a stochastic transition-based reward function, there exists an\nMDP with a deterministic state-based reward function, such that for any given\n(randomized) policy for the first MDP, there exists a corresponding policy for\nthe second MDP, such that both Markov reward processes share the same reward\nsequence. Secondly we illustrate that two situations require the proposed SATs\nin an inventory control problem. One could be using Q-learning (or other\nlearning methods) on MDPs with transition-based reward functions, and the other\ncould be using methods, which are for the Markov processes with a deterministic\nstate-based reward functions, on the Markov processes with general reward\nfunctions. We show the advantage of the SATs by considering Value-at-Risk as an\nexample, which is a risk measure on the reward distribution instead of the\nmeasures (such as mean and variance) of the distribution. We illustrate the\nerror in the reward distribution estimation from the direct use of Q-learning,\nand show how the SATs enable a variance formula to work on Markov processes\nwith general reward functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 21:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

A main reason for the existence of such networks\nis the transmission of items through the entities of these complex systems.\nHere, we consider a communicability function that accounts for the routes\nthrough which items flow on networks. Such a function induces a natural\nembedding of a network in a Euclidean high-dimensional sphere. We use one of\nthe geometric parameters of this embedding, namely the angle between the\nposition vectors of the nodes in the hyperspheres, to extract structural\ninformation from networks. Such information is extracted by using machine\nlearning techniques, such as nonmetric multidimensional scaling and K-means\nclustering algorithms. The first allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the\ncommunicability hyperspheres to 3-dimensional ones that allow network\nvisualization. The second permits to cluster the nodes of the networks based on\ntheir similarities in terms of their capacity to successfully deliver\ninformation through the network. After testing these approaches in benchmark\nnetworks and compare them with the most used clustering methods in networks we\nanalyze two real-world examples. In the first, consisting of a citation\nnetwork, we discover citation groups that reflect the level of mathematics used\nin their publications. In the second, we discover groups of genes that\ncoparticipate in human diseases, reporting a few genes that coparticipate in\ncancer and other diseases.

However, simultaneous\nexplanation of (a) distortion perception in natural image databases and (b)\ncontrast perception of artificial stimuli requires very specific modifications\nin classical Divisive Normalization. First, the wavelet response has to be\nhigh-pass filtered before the Gaussian interaction is applied. Then, distinct\nweights per subband are also required after the Gaussian interaction. In\nsummary, the classical Gaussian kernel has to be left- and right-multiplied by\ntwo extra diagonal matrices.\n  In this paper we provide a lower-level justification for this specific\nempirical modification required in the Gaussian kernel of Divisive\nNormalization.

For the baseline case with\n30% of fleet requiring battery pack replacements and a price differential of\nUS\\$50,000, we find a payback period of about 3 years.

Approach: Eight\ndrive and measurement electrode patterns are compared using a finite element\n(FE) four cylindrical shell model of a peripheral nerve and a 32 channel\ndual-ring nerve cuff. The central layer of the FE model contains impedance\nchanges representative of neural activity of -0.3 in the length axis and -8.8 x\n10-4 in the radial axis. Four of the electrode patterns generate longitudinal\ndrive current, which runs perpendicular to the anisotropic axis. Main results:\nTransverse current patterns produce higher resolution than longitudinal\npatterns but are also more susceptible to noise and errors, and exhibit poorer\nsensitivity to impedance changes in central sample locations. Three of the four\nlongitudinal current patterns considered can reconstruct fascicle level\nimpedance changes with up to 0.2 mV noise and error, which corresponds to\nbetween -5.5 and +0.18 dB of the normalised signal standard deviation. Reducing\nthe spacing between the two electrode rings in all longitudinal current\npatterns reduced the signal to error ratio across all depth locations of the\nsample. Significance: Electrode patterns which target the large impedance\nchange in the anisotropic length axis can provide improved robustness against\nnoise and errors, which is a critical step towards real time EIT imaging of\nneural activity in peripheral nerve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 00:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

In the framework\nof this approach, the main input information required for calculations of\nacoustic emission spectra is the normal displacements of the crack edges as a\nfunction of frequency and wavenumber. Two simple approximate models defining\nthis function are used in this paper for calculations of the acoustic emission\nspectra and directivity functions of a crack of finite length. The simplest\nmodel considers a crack that opens monotonously to its static value. The more\nrefined model accounts for oscillations during crack opening and considers a\ncrack of finite size as a resonator for symmetric modes of Rayleigh waves\npropagating along the crack edges and partly reflecting from the crack tips.\nAnalytical solutions for generated acoustic emission spectra are obtained for\nboth models and compared with each other. It is shown that resonant properties\nof a crack are responsible for the appearance of noticeable peaks in the\nfrequency spectra of generated acoustic emission signals that can be used for\nevaluation of crack sizes.

We report here on\nan extension of previous Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-ray burst afterglows.\nThe model now includes the synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) process and so can\nsimulate afterglows across the entire EM spectrum, and several orders of\nmagnitude in time. In keeping with earlier work, inclusion of the thermal\nelectrons increases the SSA frequency by a factor of 30, and the radio\nintensity by a factor of 100. Furthermore, these changes happen with no\nmodification to the late optical or X-ray afterglow. Our results provide very\nstrong evidence that thermal electrons must be considered in any\nmultiwavelength model for afterglows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 03:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

PCN consists of\nthree stages, each of which not only distinguishes the faces from non-faces,\nbut also calibrates the RIP orientation of each face candidate to upright\nprogressively. By dividing the calibration process into several progressive\nsteps and only predicting coarse orientations in early stages, PCN can achieve\nprecise and fast calibration. By performing binary classification of face vs.\nnon-face with gradually decreasing RIP ranges, PCN can accurately detect faces\nwith full $360^{\\circ}$ RIP angles.

This algorithm is applicable to\na broad class of problems where the cost is expressed as a time-varying\nnorm-like function of the control input, enabling inclusion of complex\noperational constraints in the control planning problem. First, it is shown\nthat the reachable sets for this problem have identical properties to those in\nprior works using constant cost functions, enabling use of existing algorithms\nin conjunction with newly derived contact and support functions. By\nreformulating the optimal control problem as a semi-infinite convex program, it\nis also demonstrated that the time-invariant component of the commonly studied\nprimer vector is an outward normal vector to the reachable set at the target\nstate. Using this formulation, a fast and robust algorithm that provides\nglobally optimal impulsive control input sequences is proposed. The algorithm\niteratively refines estimates of an outward normal vector to the reachable set\nat the target state and a minimal set of control input times until the\noptimality criteria are satisfied to within a user-specified tolerance. Next,\noptimal control inputs are computed by solving a quadratic program.

An approach to the verification of\nquantum computation within the framework of interactive proofs has been\nfruitful for addressing this problem. Specifically, an untrusted agent (prover)\nalleging to perform quantum computations can have his claims verified by\nanother agent (verifier) who only has access to classical computation and a\nsmall quantum device for preparing or measuring single qubits.

In the absence of disorder the\nsystem hosts antiferromagnetic (AFM) and columnar valence-bond-solid (VBS)\nground states. The VBS breaks $Z_4$ symmetry, and in the presence of\narbitrarily weak disorder it forms domains. Using QMC simulations, we\ndemonstrate two kinds of such disordered VBS states. Upon dilution, a removed\nsite leaves a localized spin in the opposite sublattice. These spins form AFM\norder. For random interactions, we find a different state, with no order but\nalgebraically decaying mean correlations. We identify localized spinons at the\nnexus of domain walls between different VBS patterns. These spinons form\ncorrelated groups with the same number of spinons and antispinons. Within such\na group, there is a strong tendency to singlet formation, because of\nspinon-spinon interactions mediated by the domain walls. Thus, no long-range\nAFM order forms. We propose that this state is a 2D analog of the well-known 1D\nrandom singlet (RS) state, though the dynamic exponent $z$ in 2D is finite.

If the host galaxy has a shallow profile the hardening is too slow to\nallow for coalescence within a Hubble time, unless the initial cluster orbit is\nhighly eccentric. If the galaxy hosts a nuclear star cluster, the hardening\nleads to coalescence by emission of GWs within $3-4$ Gyr. In this case, we find\na IMBH-SMBH merger rate of $\\Gamma_{\\rm IMBH-SMBH} = 2.8\\times 10^{-3}$\nyr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. If the GC hosts a population of stellar BHs, these are\ndeposited close enough to the SMBH to form extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals with a\nmerger rate of $\\Gamma_{\\rm EMRI} = 0.25$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. Finally, the\nSMBH tidal field can boost the coalescence of stellar black hole binaries\ndelivered from the infalling GCs. The merger rate for this merging channel is\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm BHB} = 0.4-4$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 09:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Massive\nMIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance\nthe average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time division\nduplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different\nuplink (UL) and downlink (DL) sub-frame configurations, is a promising\nenhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic\nTDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic\npatterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference\namong cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique\ncharacteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a\nmarriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the\nlimitation of dynamic TDD in macro cell (MC) networks.

We\nintroduce {\\it imitation games,} in which the players display linked behaviour,\nand which contains as subclasses the classes of variable assignment games,\nbinary constraint system games, synchronous games, many games based on graphs,\nand {\\it unique} games. We associate a C*-algebra $C^*(\\mathcal{G})$ to any\nimitation game $\\mathcal{G}$, and show that the existence of perfect quantum\ncommuting (resp.\\ quantum, local) strategies of $\\mathcal{G}$ can be\ncharacterised in terms of properties of this C*-algebra, extending known\nresults about synchronous games. We single out a subclass of imitation games,\nwhich we call {\\it mirror games,} and provide a characterisation of their\nquantum commuting strategies that has an algebraic flavour, showing in addition\nthat their approximately quantum perfect strategies arise from amenable traces\non the encoding C*-algebra. We describe the main classes of non-signalling\ncorrelations in terms of states on operator system tensor products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 10:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-09"}

Using an effective\nHamiltonian, we first show why the transition amplitudes that increase\noccupation numbers are exponentially suppressed and how a very special family\nof classicalizing theories compensates this suppression. This is thanks to a\nlarge micro-state entropy generated by the emergent gapless modes around the\nfinal classical state. The dressing of the process by the super-soft quanta of\nthese modes compensates the exponential suppression of the transition\nprobability. Hence, an unsuppressed classicalization takes place exclusively\ninto the states of exponentially enhanced memory storage capacity. Next, we\ndescribe this phenomenon in the language of a quantum neural network, in which\nthe neurons are represented as interconnected quantum modes with gravity-like\nnegative-energy synaptic connections. We show that upon an injection of energy\nin form of a hard quantum stimulus, the network reaches the classicalized state\nof exponentially enhanced memory capacity with order one probability. We\nconstruct a simple model in which the transition results into classical states\nthat carry an area-law micro-state entropy. In this language, a non-Wilsonian\nUV-completion of the Standard Model via classicalization implies that above\ncutoff energy the theory operates as a brain network that softens the high\nenergy quanta by bringing itself into the state of a maximal memory capacity. A\nsimilar interpretation applies to black hole formation in particle collision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 10:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

Hence, tuning the trap frequencies makes it possible to rotate the\neigenmodes such that both eigenmodes have a large projection onto any desired\ndirection in the lattice plane, in particular, onto the direction along which\nRaman cooling works. Using this, we achieve two-dimensional Raman ground-state\ncooling in a geometry where this would be impossible, if the eigenmodes were\nnot rotated. Our experiment is performed with a single atom inside an optical\nresonator but this is inessential and the scheme is expected to work equally\nwell in other situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 10:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 14:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

We show that the $(1+1)$ EA requires $\\Theta(n^w)$\nexpected function evaluations to find the optimum, whereas the $(1+1)$ MA with\nbest-improvement and first-improvement local search can find the optimum in\n$\\Theta(n^2+n^3/w^2)$ and $\\Theta(n^3/w^2)$ function evaluations, respectively.\nSurprisingly, while increasing the hurdle width makes the problem harder for\nevolutionary algorithms, the problem becomes easier for memetic algorithms. We\ndiscuss how these findings can explain and illustrate the success of memetic\nalgorithms for problems with big valley structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 11:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

The\ncost functions and the resulting optimal trajectories may have a probabilistic\ninterpretation, for instance by linking data assimilation with Maximum\nAposteriori (MAP) estimation. This is possible in particular if the unknown\ntrajectory is modelled as the solution of a stochastic differential equation\n(SDE), as is increasingly the case in weather forecasting and climate\nmodelling. In this case, the MAP estimator (or \"most probable path\" of the SDE)\nis obtained by minimising the Onsager--Machlup functional. Although this fact\nis well known, there seems to be some confusion in the literature, with the\nenergy (or \"least squares\") functional sometimes been claimed to yield the most\nprobable path. The first aim of this paper is to address this confusion and\nshow that the energy functional does not, in general, provide the most probable\npath. The second aim is to discuss the implications in practice. Although the\nmentioned results pertain to stochastic models in continuous time, they do have\nconsequences in practice where SDE's are approximated by discrete time schemes.\nIt turns out that using an approximation to the SDE and calculating its most\nprobable path does not necessarily yield a good approximation to the most\nprobable path of the SDE proper. This suggest that even in discrete time, a\nversion of the Onsager--Machlup functional should be used, rather than the\nenergy functional, at least if the solution is to be interpreted as a MAP\nestimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 11:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

This is arguably more important today than ever\nbefore, as NMT has been shown in many studies to outperform SMT, but mostly\nwhen large parallel corpora are available; in cases where data is limited, SMT\ncan still outperform NMT.\n  Recently researchers have shown that back-translating monolingual data can be\nused to create synthetic parallel corpora, which in turn can be used in\ncombination with authentic parallel data to train a high-quality NMT system.\nGiven that large collections of new parallel text become available only quite\nrarely, backtranslation has become the norm when building state-of-the-art NMT\nsystems, especially in resource-poor scenarios.\n  However, we assert that there are many unknown factors regarding the actual\neffects of back-translated data on the translation capabilities of an NMT\nmodel. Accordingly, in this work we investigate how using back-translated data\nas a training corpus -- both as a separate standalone dataset as well as\ncombined with human-generated parallel data -- affects the performance of an\nNMT model.

Our goal is to study the differences that occur in the\nphase space structure at the vertical 2:1 resonance region in this case, with\nrespect to the known, well studied, standard case, in which the families with\nthe frown-smile profiles are stable and support an X-shaped morphology. The\npotential used in the study originates in a frozen snapshot of an $N$-body\nsimulation in which a fast bar has evolved. We follow the evolution of the\nvertical stability of the central family of periodic orbits as a function of\nthe energy (Jacobi constant) and we investigate the phase space content by\nmeans of spaces of section. The two bifurcating families at the vertical 2:1\nresonance region of the new model change their stability with respect to that\nof most studied analytic potentials. The structure in the side-on view that is\ndirectly supported by the trapping of quasi-periodic orbits around 3D stable\nperiodic orbits has now an infinity symbol (i.e. $\\infty$-type) profile.\nHowever, the available sticky orbits can reinforce other types of side-on\nmorphologies as well. In the new model, the dynamical mechanism of trapping\nquasi-periodic orbits around the 3D stable periodic orbits that build the\npeanut, supports the $\\infty$-type profile. The same mechanism in the standard\ncase supports the X shape with the frown-smile orbits. Nevertheless, in both\ncases (i.e. in the new and in the standard model) a combination of 3D\nquasi-periodic orbits around the stable x1 family with sticky orbits can\nsupport a profile reminiscent of the shape of the orbits of the 3D unstable\nfamily existing in each model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 12:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Although critical, methods for learning\nheterogeneous regression ensembles have not been proposed at large scale,\nwhereas in classical ML literature, stacking, cascading and voting are mostly\nrestricted to classification problems. Regression poses distinct learning\nchallenges that may result in poor performance, even when using well\nestablished homogeneous ensemble schemas such as bagging or boosting.\n  In this paper, we introduce MetaBags, a novel, practically useful stacking\nframework for regression. MetaBags is a meta-learning algorithm that learns a\nset of meta-decision trees designed to select one base model (i.e. expert) for\neach query, and focuses on inductive bias reduction. A set of meta-decision\ntrees are learned using different types of meta-features, specially created for\nthis purpose - to then be bagged at meta-level. This procedure is designed to\nlearn a model with a fair bias-variance trade-off, and its improvement over\nbase model performance is correlated with the prediction diversity of different\nexperts on specific input space subregions.

There has been little work discussing on the backbone\nfeature extractor specifically designed for the object detection. More\nimportantly, there are several differences between the tasks of image\nclassification and object detection. 1. Recent object detectors like FPN and\nRetinaNet usually involve extra stages against the task of image classification\nto handle the objects with various scales. 2. Object detection not only needs\nto recognize the category of the object instances but also spatially locate the\nposition. Large downsampling factor brings large valid receptive field, which\nis good for image classification but compromises the object location ability.\nDue to the gap between the image classification and object detection, we\npropose DetNet in this paper, which is a novel backbone network specifically\ndesigned for object detection.

Under this scenario, DCNNs offers a\nviable solution to automate the information extraction process from digital\ndocuments.

EDFs are derived from effective\ninteractions commonly fitted to nuclear masses, charge radii and, in many\ncases, also to pseudo-data such as nuclear matter properties. Although in a\nmodel dependent way, EDFs constitute nowadays a unique tool to reliably and\nconsistently access bulk ground state and collective excited state properties\nof atomic nuclei along the nuclear chart as well as the EoS. For comparison,\nsome emphasis is also given to the results obtained with the so called {\\it ab\ninitio} approaches that aim at describing the nuclear EoS based on interactions\nfitted to few-body data only.

More specifically, we\nshow that key geometric characteristics of the random motion, such as Busemann\nfunctions and bipolar coordinates evaluated at its location, and hyperbolic\ndistance from the origin, can be either explicitly computed or approximated in\nterms of the random walk. We also consider a variant of the model where the\nmotion is not confined to a single arc, but rather the particle switches\nbetween arcs of a parabolic pencil of circles at random times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 13:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 01:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across\nthe disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,\nthe polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can\nalso be explained by models of pure scattering. We compare the polarization\nwith that of the Class I/II source HL Tau. A comparison of cuts of the\npolarization fraction across the major and minor axes of both sources reveals\nthat IM Lup has a substantially higher polarization fraction than HL Tau toward\nthe center of the disk. This enhanced polarization fraction could be due a\nnumber of factors, including higher optical depth in HL Tau, or scattering by\nlarger dust grains in the more evolved IM Lup disk.

Experimental determination of protein structures is\ncostly and therefore limited to a small fraction of all known proteins. Hence,\ndifferent computational structure prediction methods are necessary for the\nmodelling of the vast majority of all proteins. In most structure prediction\npipelines, the last step is to select the best available model and to estimate\nits accuracy. This model quality estimation problem has been growing in\nimportance during the last decade, and progress is believed to be important for\nlarge scale modelling of proteins. The current generation of model quality\nestimation programs performs well at separating incorrect and good models, but\nfails to consistently identify the best possible model.

Using $\\ell_1$ regularization results in a convex problem but\nrequires $O(n^2)$ storage, and is typically solved by the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers which takes $O(n^3)$ flops. The $\\ell_0$ model is\nnon-convex but only needs memory linear in $n$, and is solved via orthogonal\nmatching pursuit and cannot handle the case of affine subspaces.

This\npaper catalogues the first step in the design of globally constraint-preserving\nDGTD schemes. The algorithms presented here are based on a novel DG-like method\nthat is applied to a Yee-type staggering of the electromagnetic field variables\nin the faces of the mesh. The other two novel building blocks of the method\ninclude constraint-preserving reconstruction of the electromagnetic fields and\nmultidimensional Riemann solvers; both of which have been developed in recent\nyears by the first author.

The use of HLS\nincreases accessibility across a broad user community and allows for a drastic\ndecrease in firmware development time. We map out FPGA resource usage and\nlatency versus neural network hyperparameters to identify the problems in\nparticle physics that would benefit from performing neural network inference\nwith FPGAs. For our example jet substructure model, we fit well within the\navailable resources of modern FPGAs with a latency on the scale of 100 ns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 16:46:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 21:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

Then the resource allocation is defined as\na total utilitarianism problem that is an optimization problem of sum of users\nutility functions subjected to capacity constraint. Recently, a stochastic\nstate-dependent variant of AIMD algorithm is used for allocation of common\ngoods among users with strictly increasing and concave utility functions. Here,\nthe stochastic AIMD algorithm is derandomized and its efficiency is compared\nwith the stochastic version. Moreover, the algorithm is improved to allocate\nsubsidized goods to users with concave and non-monotone utility functions as\nwell as users with Sigmoidal utility functions.

The existing formal semantics for\nRust only covers limited subsets of the major language features of Rust.\nMoreover, they formalize OBS as type systems at the language-level, which can\nonly be used to conservatively analyze programs against the OBS invariants at\ncompile-time. That is, they are not executable, and thus cannot be used for\nautomated verification of runtime behavior.\n  In this paper, we propose RustSEM, a new executable operational semantics for\nRust.

Moreover, RustSEM provides an operational semantics for OBS\nat the memory-level, which can be used to verify the runtime behavior of Rust\nprograms against the OBS invariants. We have implemented RustSEM in the\nexecutable semantics modeling tool K-Framework. We have evaluated the semantics\ncorrectness of RustSEM wrt. the Rust compiler using around 700 tests. In\nparticular, we have proposed a new technique for testing semantic consistency\nto ensure the absence of semantic ambiguities on all possible execution\nselections.

Although we have a number of theoretical approaches enabling to\nquantitatively estimate equilibrium properties by applying given potential\nenergy surface (PES) to the thermodynamic average, it is generally unclear\nwhether PES can be stablly, inversely determined from a given set of\nproperties. This essentially comes from the fact that bidirectional stability\ncharacters of thermodynamic average for classical system is not sufficiently\nunderstood so far. Our recent study reveals that for classical discrete system,\nthis property for a set of microscopic states satisfying special condition can\nbe well-characterized by a newly-introduced concept of anharmonicity in the\nstructural degree of freedom of D, where these states are expected to be stably\ninversed to underlying PES, known without any thermodynamic information.\nHowever, it is still quantitatively unclear how the bidirectional stability\ncharacter is broken inside the configuration space. Here we show that the\nbreaking in bidirectional stability for thermodynamic average is quantitatively\nformulated: We find that the breaking is mainly dominated by the sum of\ndivergence and Jacobian of vector field D in configuration space, which can be\nfully known a priori only from geometric information of underlying lattice,\nwithout using any thermodynamic information such as energy or temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 06:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 10:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}
