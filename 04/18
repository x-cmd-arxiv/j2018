For Modified Gravity models, we use the scale-independent and\n-dependent parametrizations, in particular, two $f(R)$ and two Chameleon-like\nmodels are considered within the quasi-static approximation. Given the employed\nformalism, we found that the critical points and stability features of the\ndynamical systems for Modified Gravity models are the same as those found in\nthe standard $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model. However, the behavior around the\ncritical points suffers important modifications in some specific cases.

The first synthesizer extends the well\nknown cylinder-bell-funnel (CBF) dataset to multidimensional time series. Here,\neach time series has an arbitrary type (cylinder, bell, or funnel) in each\ndimension, thus for $d$-dimensional time series there are $3^{d}$ different\nclasses. The second synthesizer (RAM) creates time series with ideas adapted\nfrom Brownian motions which is a common model of movement in physics. Finally,\nwe evaluate the applicability of a 1-nearest neighbor classifier using DTW on\ndatasets generated by our synthesizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 16:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 15:46:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 06:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}

Adaptivity\nquantifies the number of sequential rounds that an algorithm makes when\nfunction evaluations can be executed in parallel. Adaptivity is a fundamental\nconcept that is heavily studied across a variety of areas in computer science,\nlargely due to the need for parallelizing computation. For the canonical\nproblem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality\nconstraint, it is well known that a simple greedy algorithm achieves a $1-1/e$\napproximation and that this approximation is optimal for polynomial-time\nalgorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, despite extensive efforts on submodular\noptimization for large-scale datasets, until very recently there was no known\nalgorithm that achieves a constant factor approximation for this problem whose\nadaptivity is sublinear in the size of the ground set $n$.\n  Recent work by Balkanski and Singer describes an algorithm that obtains an\napproximation arbitrarily close to $1/3$ in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ adaptive\nrounds and shows that no algorithm can obtain a constant factor approximation\nin $\\tilde{o}(\\log n)$ adaptive rounds. This approach achieves an exponential\nspeedup in adaptivity (and parallel running time) at the expense of\napproximation quality.\n  In this paper we describe a novel approach that yields an algorithm whose\napproximation is arbitrarily close to the optimal $1-1/e$ guarantee in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ adaptive rounds. This algorithm therefore achieves an\nexponential speedup in parallel running time for submodular maximization at the\nexpense of an arbitrarily small loss in approximation quality. This guarantee\nis optimal in both approximation and adaptivity, up to lower order terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 16:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

In this work, we study a new problem, that is, simultaneously\nrecovering 3D shape and surface color from a single image, namely \"colorful 3D\nreconstruction\". This problem is both challenging and intriguing because the\nability to infer textured 3D model from a single image is at the core of visual\nunderstanding. Here, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework, Colorful\nVoxel Network (CVN), to tackle this problem. Conditioned on a single 2D input,\nCVN learns to decompose shape and surface color information of a 3D object into\na 3D shape branch and a surface color branch, respectively. Specifically, for\nthe shape recovery, we generate a shape volume with the state of its voxels\nindicating occupancy. For the surface color recovery, we combine the strength\nof appearance hallucination and geometric projection by concurrently learning a\nregressed color volume and a 2D-to-3D flow volume, which are then fused into a\nblended color volume. The final textured 3D model is obtained by sampling color\nfrom the blended color volume at the positions of occupied voxels in the shape\nvolume. To handle the severe sparse volume representations, a novel loss\nfunction, Mean Squared False Cross-Entropy Loss (MSFCEL), is designed.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant\nimprovement over baselines, and shows great generalization across diverse\nobject categories and arbitrary viewpoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 17:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

A common way to achieve the\nconsensus is to enable each component to equally participate in the aggregation\nprocess. A problem with this approach is that poor components are likely to\nnegatively affect the quality of the consensus result. To address this issue,\nalternatives have been explored in the literature to build selective classifier\nand cluster ensembles, where only a subset of the components contributes to the\ncomputation of the consensus. Of the family of ensemble methods, outlier\nensembles are the least studied. Only recently, the selection problem for\noutlier ensembles has been discussed. In this work we define a new graph-based\nclass of ranking selection methods.

The main effect of pore vibrations is the suppression of stalling\nevents of the translocation dynamics, hence, a proper frequency tuning allows\nboth regularization and control of the overall transport process. Finally, the\ninterpretation of the simulation results is easily achieved by resorting to a\nfirst passage theory of elementary driven-diffusion processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 17:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-18"}

In this\nletter, we split the standard CMB lensing quadratic estimator into a new set of\noptimal \"multipole\" estimators. On large scales, these multipole estimators\nreduce to the known magnification and shear estimators, and a new shear B-mode\nestimator. We leverage the different symmetries of the lensed CMB and\nextragalactic foregrounds to argue that the shear-only estimator should be\napproximately immune to extragalactic foregrounds.

Further, it\ndelineates the boundary at which single stars will end their lives stripped of\ntheir hydrogen-rich envelope, which in turn is a key factor in the relative\nrates of Type-II to Type-Ibc supernovae from single star channels. In this\npaper we have revisited the issue of $L_{\\rm max}$ by studying the luminosity\ndistributions of cool supergiants (SGs) in the Large and Small Magellanic\nClouds (LMC/SMC). We assemble samples of cool SGs in each galaxy which are\nhighly-complete above $\\log L/L_{\\odot}$=5.0, and determine their spectral\nenergy distributions from the optical to the mid-infrared using modern\nmulti-wavelength survey data. We show that in both cases $L_{\\rm max}$ appears\nto be lower than previously quoted, and is in the region of $\\log\nL/L_{\\odot}$=5.5. There is no evidence for $L_{\\rm max}$ being higher in the\nSMC than in the LMC, as would be expected if metallicity-dependent winds were\nthe dominant factor in the stripping of stellar envelopes. We also show that\n$L_{\\rm max}$ aligns with the lowest luminosity of single nitrogen-rich\nWolf-Rayet stars, indicating of a change in evolutionary sequence for stars\nabove a critical mass. From population synthesis analysis we show that the\nGeneva evolutionary models greatly over-predict the numbers of cool SGs in the\nSMC. We also argue that the trend of earlier average spectral types of cool SGs\nin lower metallicity environments represents a genuine shift to hotter\ntemperatures. Finally, we use our new bolometric luminosity measurements to\nprovide updated bolometric corrections for cool supergiants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Capillary\nwaves are produced here by gravity waves from nonlinear wave interactions.\nUsing a spatio-temporal measurement of the free-surface, we characterize\nstatistically the random regimes of capillary waves in the spatial and temporal\nFourier spaces. For a significant wave steepness ($0.2-0.3$), power-law spectra\nare observed both in space and time, defining a turbulent regime of capillary\nwaves transferring energy from large scale to small scale. Analysis of temporal\nfluctuations of spatial spectrum demonstrates that the capillary power-law\nspectra result from the temporal averaging over intermittent and strong\nnonlinear events transferring energy to small scale in a fast time scale, when\ncapillary wave trains are generated in a way similar to the parasitic capillary\nwave generation mechanism.

However, the energy flux is not constant through the\nscales and the wave spectrum scaling with this flux is not in good agreement\nwith Wave Turbulence Theory. These results suggest that theoretical\ndevelopments beyond the classic Wave Turbulence Theory are necessary to\ndescribe the dynamics and statistics of capillary waves in natural environment.\nIn particular, in presence of broad scale viscous dissipation and strong\nnonlinearity, the role of non-local and non-resonant interactions could be\nreconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

However, thermal\ntransport on the nanoscale is driven by infrequent collisions between thermal\nenergy carriers known as phonons and is not well described by Fourier's law. In\nthis paper, the role of non-Fourier heat conduction in nanoscale solidification\nis studied by coupling the Stefan condition to the Guyer--Krumhansl (GK)\nequation, which is an extension of Fourier's law, valid on the nanoscale, that\nincludes memory and non-local effects.

The presumed necessity of very strong materials stems from a design\nparadigm which requires structures to operate at a small fraction of their\nmaximum tensile strength (usually, 50% or less). This criterion limits the\nprobability of failure by giving structures sufficient leeway in handling\nstochastic components, such as variability in material strength and/or external\nforces. While reasonable for typical engineering structures, low working stress\nratios --- defined as operating stress as a fraction of ultimate tensile\nstrength --- in the case of megastructures are both too stringent and unable to\nadequately control the failure probability. We draw inspiration from natural\nbiological structures, such as bones, tendons and ligaments, which are made up\nof smaller substructures and exhibit self-repair, and suggest a design that\nrequires structures to operate at significantly higher stress ratios, while\nmaintaining reliability through a continuous repair mechanism. We outline a\nmathematical framework for analysing the reliability of structures with\ncomponents exhibiting probabilistic rupture and repair that depend on their\ntime-in-use (age). Further, we predict time-to-failure distributions for the\noverall structure. We then apply this framework to the space elevator and find\nthat a high degree of reliability is achievable using currently existing\nmaterials, provided it operates at sufficiently high working stress ratios,\nsustained through an autonomous repair mechanism, implemented via, e.g.,\nrobots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 19:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

Compared with machines, human beings are extremely good at\nlearning a specific target concept (e.g., classifying the images into given\ncategories) and they can also easily transfer the learned concepts into similar\nlearning tasks. Therefore, a more effective way of utilizing crowdsourcing is\nby supervising the crowd to label in the form of teaching. In order to perform\nthe teaching and expertise estimation simultaneously, we propose an adaptive\nteaching framework named JEDI to construct the personalized optimal teaching\nset for the crowdsourcing workers. In JEDI teaching, the teacher assumes that\neach learner has an exponentially decayed memory. Furthermore, it ensures\ncomprehensiveness in the learning process by carefully balancing teaching\ndiversity and learner's accurate learning in terms of teaching usefulness.\nFinally, we validate the effectiveness and efficacy of JEDI teaching in\ncomparison with the state-of-the-art techniques on multiple data sets with both\nsynthetic learners and real crowdsourcing workers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 22:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 19:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

The generalization performance of ZSL is\ngoverned by the attributes, which transfer semantic information from seen\nclasses to unseen classes. To take full advantage of the knowledge transferred\nby attributes, in this paper, we introduce the notion of complementary\nattributes (CA), as a supplement to the original attributes, to enhance the\nsemantic representation ability. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that\ncomplementary attributes can improve the PAC-style generalization bound of\noriginal ZSL model. Since the proposed CA focuses on enhancing the semantic\nrepresentation, CA can be easily applied to any existing attribute-based ZSL\nmethods, including the label-embedding strategy based ZSL (LEZSL) and the\nprobability-prediction strategy based ZSL (PPZSL). In PPZSL, there is a strong\nassumption that all the attributes are independent of each other, which is\narguably unrealistic in practice. To solve this problem, a novel rank\naggregation framework is proposed to circumvent the assumption.

At their core, CNN\ncomputations are made up of multi-dimensional dot products between weight and\ninput vectors. This paper studies how weight repetition ---when the same weight\noccurs multiple times in or across weight vectors--- can be exploited to save\nenergy and improve performance during CNN inference. This generalizes a popular\nline of work to improve efficiency from CNN weight sparsity, as reducing\ncomputation due to repeated zero weights is a special case of reducing\ncomputation due to repeated weights.\n  To exploit weight repetition, this paper proposes a new CNN accelerator\ncalled the Unique Weight CNN Accelerator (UCNN). UCNN uses weight repetition to\nreuse CNN sub-computations (e.g., dot products) and to reduce CNN model size\nwhen stored in off-chip DRAM ---both of which save energy. UCNN further\nimproves performance by exploiting sparsity in weights. We evaluate UCNN with\nan accelerator-level cycle and energy model and with an RTL implementation of\nthe UCNN processing element. On three contemporary CNNs, UCNN improves\nthroughput-normalized energy consumption by 1.2x - 4x, relative to a similarly\nprovisioned baseline accelerator that uses Eyeriss-style sparsity\noptimizations.

Two distinct non-Markovian mechanisms are considered via two types of\ncollision models, one where the system $S$ consecutively interacts with the\nancillas and a second where $S$ collides only with an intermediate system $S'$\nwhich in turn interacts with the ancillas. We show that in both models the\nrelation between non-Markovianity and temperature is non-monotonic. In\nparticular, revivals of non-Markovianity may occur as temperature increases.

The robot Laika is\nunder development as a quadruped with a flexible, actuated spine designed to\nassist with foot movement and balance during these gaits. This paper presents\nthe first set of hardware designs for the spine of Laika, a physical prototype\nof those designs, and tests in both hardware and simulations that show the\nprototype's capabilities. Laika's spine is a tensegrity structure, used for its\nadvantages with weight and force distribution, and represents the first working\nprototype of a tensegrity spine for a quadruped robot. The spine bends by\nadjusting the lengths of the cables that separate its vertebrae, and twists\nusing an actuated rotating vertebra at its center. The current prototype of\nLaika has stiff legs attached to the spine, and is used as a test setup for\nevaluation of the spine itself. This work shows the advantages of Laika's spine\nby demonstrating the spine lifting each of the robot's four feet, both as a\nform of balancing and as a precursor for a walking gait. These foot motions,\nusing specific combinations of bending and rotation movements of the spine, are\nmeasured in both simulation and hardware experiments.

We show\nthat while the p-wave contacts related to the scattering volume monotonically\nincreases with increasing the interaction strength, one related to the\neffective range non-monotonically depends on interaction strength and its sign\nchanges in the intermediate-coupling regime. The non-monotonic interaction\ndependence of these quantities is shown to originate from the competition\nbetween the increase of the cutoff momentum and the decrease of the coupling\nconstant of the p-wave interaction with increasing the effective range.

It solves the original problem to optimality by\nsuccessively linearizing non-convex dynamics and constraints about the solution\nof the previous iteration. The resulting convex subproblems are numerically\ntractable, and can be computed quickly and reliably using convex optimization\nsolvers, making the SCvx algorithm well suited for real-time applications.\nAnalysis is presented to show that the algorithm converges both globally and\nsuperlinearly, guaranteeing i) local optimality recovery: if the converged\nsolution is feasible with respect to the original problem, then it is also a\nlocal optimum; ii) strong convergence: if the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL)\ninequality holds at the converged solution, then the solution is unique. The\nsuperlinear rate of convergence is obtained by exploiting the structure of\noptimal control problems, showcasing that faster rate of convergence can be\nachieved by leveraging specific problem properties when compared to generic\nnonlinear programming methods.

The initial photospheric disturbances were localized in the region of\nstrong horizontal magnetic field of the PIL, and, thus, are likely associated\nwith a compact sheared magnetic structure elongated along the PIL.

Aims. In this work\nwe aim to determine stellar distances and ages using Gaia and\nspectrophotometric data in a consistent way. We estimate precisions of age and\ndistance determinations with Gaia end-of-mission and TGAS parallax precisions.\nMethods. To this end we incorporated parallax and extinction data into the\nisochrone fitting method used in the Unified tool to estimate Distances, Ages,\nand Masses (UniDAM).

Using TGAS\nparallaxes in isochrone fitting we are able to reduce distance and age estimate\nuncertainties for TGAS stars for distances up to 1 kpc by more than one third,\ncompared to results based only on spectrophotometric data.

Since then, there have been many developments in the\nstudy of edge states in the quantum Hall effect, including the prediction of\nmultiple counter-propagating modes in the fractional quantum Hall regime, the\nprediction of edge mode renormalization due to disorder, and studies of how the\nsample confining potential affects the edge state structure (edge\nreconstruction), among others. In this paper, we study edge transport for the\n$\\nu_{\\text{bulk}}=2/3$ edge in the disordered, fully incoherent transport\nregime. To do so, we use a hydrodynamic approximation for the calculation of\nvoltage and temperature profiles along the edge of the sample.

We\nfind that in the fully incoherent regime, the topological characteristics of\ntransport (quantized electrical and heat conductance) are intact, with finite\nsize corrections which are determined by the extent of equilibration.

Due to the tremendous system\nthroughput requirements that next generation Satellite Communications (SatCom)\nexpect to achieve, traditional 4-colour frequency reuse schemes are not\nsufficient anymore and more aggressive solutions as full frequency reuse are\nbeing considered for multi-beam SatCom. These approaches require advanced\ninterference management techniques to cope with the significantly increased\ninter-beam interference both at the transmitter, e.g., precoding, and at the\nreceiver, e.g., Multi User Detection (MUD). With respect to the former, several\npeculiar challenges arise when designed for SatCom systems. In particular,\nmultiple users are multiplexed in the same transmission radio frame, thus\nimposing to consider multiple channel matrices when computing the precoding\ncoefficients. In previous works, the main focus has been on the users'\nclustering and precoding design. However, even though achieving significant\nthroughput gains, no analysis has been performed on the impact of the system\nscheduling algorithm on multicast precoding, which is typically assumed random.\nIn this paper, we focus on this aspect by showing that, although the overall\nsystem performance is improved, a random scheduler does not properly tackle\nspecific scenarios in which the precoding algorithm can poorly perform. Based\non these considerations, we design a Geographical Scheduling Algorithm (GSA)\naimed at improving the precoding performance in these critical scenarios and,\nconsequently, the performance at system level as well.

They are cellular automata\n$\\tau \\colon A^G \\to A^G$ whose local defining map is induced by a homomorphism\nof algebraic groups $X^M \\to X$ where $M\\subset G$ is a finite memory set of\n$\\tau$.

The\nfundamental advantage of using a vector sensor as a receiver is that a single\nsensor is able to provide diversity gains offered by MIMO systems. In a recent\nwork novel framework for evaluating capacity of underwater channel was\nproposed. The approach is based on modeling the channel as a set of paths along\nwhich the signal arrives at the receiver with different Angles of Arrival. In\nthis work, we build on that framework to provide a bound on the achievable\ncapacity of such a system. The analytical bounds have been compared against\nsimulation results for a vector sensor based SIMO underwater communications\nsystem. The channel parameters are modeled by analysing the statistics\ngenerated with Bellhop simulation tool.

The graph exploration problem is a theoretical and abstract model,\nwhere an algorithm has to decide how the agent, also called explorer, moves\nthrough a network such that every point of interest is visited at least once.\nFor its decisions, the knowledge of the algorithm is limited by the perception\nof the explorer.\n  There are different models regarding the perception of the explorer.

The Kronig-Penney model is a one-dimensional\nperiodic array of delta functions that models the energy bands in a crystal.\nHere we investigate contact interactions that generalize the delta function\npotential and corresponding generalizations of the Kronig-Penney model within\nconventional and parity-time symmetric quantum mechanics (PTQM). In\nconventional quantum mechanics we determine the most general contact\ninteraction compatible with self-adjointness; in PTQM we consider interactions\nthat are symmetric under the combined transformation PT. In both cases we find\nthat the most general interaction has four independent real parameters;\ndepending on the parameter values the interaction can support more bound states\nthan the conventional delta function. In the PT case the two bound state\nenergies can be both real or a complex conjugate pair, with the transition\ncorresponding to the breaking of PT-symmetry. The scattering states for the PT\ncase are also found to exhibit spontaneous breaking of PT-symmetry. We\ninvestigate the energy bands when the generalized contact interactions are\nrepeated periodically in space in one dimension. In the Hermitian case we find\nthat the two bound states result in two narrow bands generically separated by a\ngap. These bands intersect at a single point in the Brillouin zone as the\ninteraction parameters are varied. Near the intersection the bands form a\nmassless Dirac cone. In the PT-symmetric case, as the parameters of the contact\ninteraction are varied the two bound state bands undergo a PT-symmetry breaking\ntransition wherein the two band energies go from being real to being a complex\nconjugate pair. The PT-symmetric Kronig-Penney model provides a simple soluble\nexample of the transition which has the same form as in other models of\nPT-symmetric crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 12:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

In particular, we introduce the Reeb commutator\nfunction and the Reeb Killing function, we define the new classes of canonical\nalmost 3-contact metric manifolds and of 3-$(\\alpha,\\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds\n(including as special cases 3-Sasaki manifolds, quaternionic Heisenberg groups,\nand many others) and prove that the latter are hypernormal, thus generalizing a\nseminal result by Kashiwada. We study their behaviour under a new class of\ndeformations, called $\\mathcal{H}$-homothetic deformations, and prove that they\nadmit an underlying quaternionic contact structure, from which we deduce the\nRicci curvature. For example, a 3-$(\\alpha,\\delta)$-Sasaki manifold is Einstein\neither if $\\alpha=\\delta$ (the 3-$\\alpha$-Sasaki case) or if\n$\\delta=(2n+3)\\alpha$, where $\\dim M=4n+3$.\n  The second part is actually devoted to finding these adapted connections.

These new variables\n(two tensor fields for the graviton, one tensor-spinor for the gravitino) are\ninjected into the action and equations of motion, which take a geometrically\nsimple form in terms of the Cotton tensor(-spinors) of the prepotentials. In\nparticular, the equations of motion of the graviton are equivalent to twisted\nself-duality conditions. We express the supersymmetric transformations of the\ngraviton and gravitino into each other in terms of the prepotentials. We also\nreproduce the dimensional reduction of supergravity within the prepotential\nformalism. Finally, our formulas in dimension five are recovered from the\ndimensional reduction of the already known prepotential formulation of the\nsix-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ maximally supersymmetric theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 13:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 12:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Our detailed analysis\nof third-order interatomic force constants reveals that the anharmonicity and\nsoft phonon modes associated with [Se$_2$]$^{2-}$ dimers lead to ultra-low\nlattice thermal conductivities in Pd$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ monolayers (1.5 and 2.9\nWm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ along the $a$- and $b$-axes at 300\\,K respectively), which\nare comparable to those of high-performance bulk thermoelectric materials such\nas PbTe. Moreover, the \"pudding-mold\" type band structure, caused by Pd$^{2+}$\n($d^{8}$) cations coordinated in a square planar crystal field, leads to high\npower factors in Pd$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ monolayers. Consequently, both electron and\nhole doped thermoelectric materials with a considerably high $zT$ can be\nachieved at moderate carrier concentrations, suggesting that Pd$_{2}$Se$_{3}$\nis a promising two-dimensional thermoelectric material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 14:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

This paper aims to explore the\nchallenges of long-horizon forecasting using LSTM networks.

This is done by building a Markov-chain representation of\nthe Lagrangian dynamics. The geography is composed of weakly interacting\nprovinces that constrain the connectivity at depth. The main geography includes\ntwo provinces of near equal areas and separated by a roughly meridional\nboundary. The residence time is about 4.5 (3.5) years in the western (eastern)\nprovince. The exchange between these provinces is effected through a slow\ncyclonic circulation, which is well constrained in the western basin by\npreservation of $f/H$, where $f$ is the Coriolis parameter and $H$ is depth.\nSecondary provinces of varied shapes covering smaller areas are identified with\nresidence times ranging from about 0.4 to 1.2 years or so. Except for the main\nprovinces, the deep Lagrangian geography does not resemble the surface\nLagrangian geography recently inferred from satellite-tracked drifter\ntrajectories. This implies disparate connectivity characteristics with\npotential implications for pollutant (e.g., oil) dispersal at the surface and\ndepth.

Yet, the complex hierarchical arrangement of\nmusic makes end-to-end learning hard for some MIR tasks - a very deep and\nflexible processing chain is necessary to model some aspect of music audio.\nRepresentations involving tones, chords, and rhythm are fundamental building\nblocks of music. This paper discusses how these can be used as intermediate\ntargets and priors in MIR to deal with structurally complex learning problems,\nwith learning modules connected in a directed acyclic graph. It is suggested\nthat this strategy for inference, referred to as deep layered learning (DLL),\ncan help generalization by (1) - enforcing the validity and invariance of\nintermediate representations during processing, and by (2) - letting the\ninferred representations establish the musical organization to support\nhigher-level invariant processing. A background to modular music processing is\nprovided together with an overview of previous publications. Relevant concepts\nfrom information processing, such as pruning, skip connections, and performance\nsupervision are reviewed within the context of DLL.

This framework naturally extends to the construction of\na perceptron model that takes into account such dynamic geometric\nconsiderations.

We then derive upper and lower bounds\nfor a notion of optimal efficient signaling between vertex pairs based on the\nstructure of the framework. Efficient signaling in the context of the framework\nwe develop here means that there needs to be a temporal match between the\narrival time of the signals relative to how quickly nodes can internally\nprocess signals. These bounds reflect numerical constraints on the compensation\nof the timing of signaling events of upstream nodes attempting to activate\ndownstream nodes they connect into that preserve this notion of efficiency.\nWhen a mismatch between signal arrival times and the internal states of\nactivated nodes occurs, it can cause a break down in the signaling dynamics of\nthe network.

Thermal stressing of jet fuel produces soluble\nmacromolecular oxidatively reactive species (SMORS) and heteroatomic deposits.\nSMORS are deposit precursors and elementary heteroatomic units containing\nunsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons. Fuel additives such as antioxidants can\ninhibit SMORS and deposit formation within limited heating residence time and\ntemperature range. Jet A-1 was thermally stressed in the autoxidation regime\n(150 to 300 0C) followed by spectroscopic analysis. Thermally stressed jet fuel\nstatic tests electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) show higher\nmolecular weight compounds in the mass range 300-1000 Da compared with\nunstressed fuel samples supporting deposition. Jet A-1 samples were analyzed by\nelectrospray ion source mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), Fourier transform infrared\n(FTIR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. FTIR bands for\noxygen containing species reveal the presence of alcohol, phenol and ether\ngroups. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) standard and distorsionless\nenhancement polarization transfer (DEPT 135) spectra recorded heteroatomic\nalkoxy species in both unstressed and thermally stressed fuel samples. Natural\nproducts polyphenols and lichen derived oxygenated compounds are excellent\nantioxidants. A new perspective of using lichen substances as fuel additives\nemerged in this study. Exploring further, natural products extraction methods\noptimization remains a key challenge and advantages of polyphenolic lichen\nacids as potential fuel and chemical additives are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 10:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}
