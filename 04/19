The present work proposes a novel modeling and\ncharacterization approach for micron-scale metal powders, with a special focus\non characteristics of importance to powder-bed AM. The model is based on the\ndiscrete element method (DEM), and the considered particle-to-particle and\nparticle-to-wall interactions involve frictional contact, rolling resistance\nand cohesive forces. Special emphasis lies on the modeling of cohesion. The\nproposed adhesion force law is defined by the pull-off force resulting from the\nsurface energy of powder particles in combination with a van-der-Waals force\ncurve regularization. The model is applied to predict the angle of repose (AOR)\nof exemplary spherical Ti-6Al-4V powders, and the surface energy value\nunderlying the adhesion force law is calibrated by fitting the corresponding\nangle of repose values from numerical and experimental funnel tests. To the\nbest of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work providing an\nexperimental estimate for the effective surface energy of the considered class\nof metal powders. By this approach, an effective surface energy of $0.1mJ/m^2$\nis found for the investigated Ti-6Al-4V powder. This value is considerably\nlower than typical experimental values for flat metal contact surfaces in the\nrange of $30-50 mJ/m^2$, indicating the crucial influence of factors such as\nsurface roughness and chemical surface contamination on fine metal powders.\nMore importantly, the present study demonstrates that a neglect of the related\ncohesive forces leads to a drastical underestimation of the AOR and,\nconsequently, to an insufficient representation of the bulk powder behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 17:08:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 08:44:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 07:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

However, the tiny Majorana\nmass splitting between TeV singlets, introduced to accommodate small neutrino\nmasses, is left unexplained. Moreover, we argue that these models suffer from a\nstructural limitation that prevents a successful leptogenesis if one insists on\nhaving unsuppressed Yukawa couplings and TeV scale singlets. In this work we\npropose a hybrid seesaw model, where we replace the mass splitting with a\ncoupling to a high scale seesaw module including a TeV scalar. We show that\nthis structure achieves the goal of filling both the above gaps with couplings\nof order unity.

Indeed, they\ngenerally predict new TeV scale physics (including scalars) potentially\naccessible at present and future colliders, whereas weakly-coupled versions may\nalso have astrophysical and cosmological signatures due to the presence of a\nlight Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to neutrinos.

Due to\ntheir different ages and different positions in phase space, different streams\ntell us different things about the Galaxy. Here we employ a Cramer--Rao (CRLB)\nor Fisher-matrix approach to understand the quantitative information content in\neleven known streams (ATLAS, GD-1, Hermus, Kwando, Orinoco, PS1A, PS1C, PS1D,\nPS1E, Sangarius and Triangulum). This approach depends on a generative model,\nwhich we have developed previously, and which permits calculation of\nderivatives of predicted stream properties with respect to Galaxy and stream\nparameters. We find that in simple analytic models of the Milky Way, streams on\neccentric orbits contain the most information about the halo shape. For each\nstream, there are near-degeneracies between dark-matter-halo properties and\nparameters of the bulge, the disk, and the stream progenitor, but simultaneous\nfitting of multiple streams will constrain all parameters at the percent level.\nAt this precision, simulated dark matter halos deviate from simple analytic\nparametrizations, so we add an expansion of basis functions to give the\ngravitational potential more freedom. As freedom increases, the information\nabout the halo reduces overall, and it becomes more localized to the current\nposition of the stream. In the limit of high model freedom, a stellar stream\nappears to measure the local acceleration at its current position; this\nmotivates thinking about future non-parametric approaches. The CRLB formalism\nalso permits us to assess the value of future measurements of stellar\nvelocities, distances, and proper motions. We show that kinematic measurements\nof stream stars are essential for producing competitive constraints on the\ndistribution of dark matter, which bodes well for stream studies in the age of\nGaia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Stars are projected back to their birth positions according to\nthe observationally derived age and [Fe/H] with no kinematical information\nrequired.

The model suggests that a virtually transparent\nlocal Universe becomes considerably opaque at redshifts $z > 2-3$. Such opacity\nis hardly to be detected in the Type Ia supernova data, but confirmed using\nquasar data. The opacity steeply increases with redshift because of a high\nproper density of intergalactic dust in the previous epochs. The temperature of\nintergalactic dust increases as $(1+z)$ and exactly compensates the change of\nwavelengths due to redshift, so that the dust radiation looks apparently like\nthe radiation of the blackbody with a single temperature. The predicted dust\ntemperature is $T^{D} = 2.776 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, which differs from the CMB\ntemperature by 1.9\\% only, and the predicted ratio between the total CMB and\nEBL intensities is 13.4 which is close to 12.5 obtained from observations.

This emission has\nbeen attributed by some as evidence for rapid formation of dust in the cooling\npostshock CSM. We investigate the physical processes that may inhibit or\nfacilitate the formation of dust in the CSM. When only radiative cooling is\nconsidered, the temperature of the dense shocked gas rapidly drops below the\ndust condensation temperature. However, by accounting for the heating of the\npostshock gas by the downstream radiation from the shock, we show that dust\nformation is inhibited until the radiation from the shock weakens, as the shock\npropagates into the less dense outer regions of the CSM. In SN 2010jl dust\nformation can therefore only commence after day 380. Only the IR emission since\nthat epoch can be attributed to the newly formed CSM dust. Observations on day\n460 and later show that the IR luminosity exceeds the UV-optical luminosity.\nThe post-shock dust cannot extinct the radiation emitted by the expanding SN\nshock. Therefore, its IR emission must be powered by an interior source, which\nwe identify with the reverse shock propagating through the SN ejecta.

We then propose a\nreal-time object detection system by combining PeleeNet with Single Shot\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) method and optimizing the architecture for fast speed.\nOur proposed detection system2, named Pelee, achieves 76.4% mAP (mean average\nprecision) on PASCAL VOC2007 and 22.4 mAP on MS COCO dataset at the speed of\n23.6 FPS on iPhone 8 and 125 FPS on NVIDIA TX2. The result on COCO outperforms\nYOLOv2 in consideration of a higher precision, 13.6 times lower computational\ncost and 11.3 times smaller model size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 19:27:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 00:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 05:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

In this context,\nit is desirable to model the development of multiple primary cancers to enable\nbetter clinical management of LFS. Here, we propose a Bayesian recurrent event\nmodel based on a non-homogeneous Poisson process in order to obtain penetrance\nestimates for multiple primary cancers related to LFS. We employed a\nfamily-wise likelihood that facilitates using genetic information inherited\nthrough the family pedigree and properly adjusted for the ascertainment bias\nthat was inevitable in studies of rare diseases by using an inverse probability\nweighting scheme. We applied the proposed method to data on LFS, using a family\ncohort collected through pediatric sarcoma patients at MD Anderson Cancer\nCenter from 1944 to 1982.

To answer this question, we perform an extensive benchmark of SCAN\nby computing the formation energies for a diverse group of nearly one thousand\ncrystalline compounds for which experimental values are known. Due to an\nenhanced exchange interaction in the covalent bonding regime, SCAN\nsubstantially decreases the formation energy errors for strongly-bound\ncompounds, by approximately 50% to 110 meV/atom, as compared to the generalized\ngradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).

The formation energy errors can\nbe further reduced via elemental chemical potential fitting.

The errors add\nrandomly, before exponential divergence sets in, with exponentiation rate\nvirtually independent of $N$, but scale saturating as $\\sim 1/\\sqrt{N}$, in\nline with theoretical estimates presented. In a third phase, the growth rate is\ninitially driven by multiplicative enhancement of errors, as in the exponential\nstage. It is then qualitatively different for the phase space variables and\nmean field conserved quantities (energy and momentum); for the former, the\nerrors grow systematically through phase mixing, for the latter they grow\ndiffusively.

This is also true for\nangular momentum in the fixed stepsize runs, although the associated error\nthreshold is higher and the relaxation time smaller.

Using refractive index matching\nand time-resolved PIV, we quantify the redistribution of energy in the drop and\nthe surrounding fluid during the drop's impact and motion through a round-edged\norifice. The measurements show the importance of a) drop kinetic energy\ntransferred to and dissipated within the surrounding liquid, and b) the drop\nkinetic energy due to internal deformation and rotation during impact and\npassage through the orifice. While a rounded orifice edge prevents contact\nbetween the drop and orifice surface, a sharp edge promotes contact immediately\nupon impact, changing the near surface flow field as well as the drop passage\ndynamics. For a sharp-edged hydrophobic orifice, the contact lines remain\nlocalized near the orifice edge, but slipping and pinning strongly affect the\ndrop propagation and outcome. For a sharp-edged hydrophilic orifice, on the\nother hand, the contact lines propagate away from the orifice edge, and their\nmotion is coupled with the global velocity fields in the drop and the\nsurrounding fluid. By examining the contact line propagation over a hydrophilic\norifice surface with minimal drop penetration, we characterize two stages of\ndrop spreading that exhibit power-law dependence with variable exponent.

A canonical value of the solar radius of 959\".63 was adopted by Auwers\nin 1891.

In these stars, heavy elements produced by H-He\nburning in the rapid proton capture (rp-) process continually freeze to form\nnew crust. In this paper, we explore the expected composition of the solid\nphase. We first demonstrate using molecular dynamics that two distinct types of\nchemical separation occur, depending on the composition of the rp-process\nashes. We then calculate phase diagrams for three-component mixtures and use\nthem to determine the allowed crust compositions. We show that, for the large\nrange of atomic numbers produced in the rp-process ($Z\\sim 10$--$50$), the\nsolid that forms has only a small number of available compositions. We conclude\nthat accreting neutron star crusts should be polycrystalline, with domains of\ndistinct composition. Our results motivate further work on the size of the\ncompositional domains, and have implications for crust physics and accreting\nneutron star phenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 23:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Most DES techniques\nestimate the competence of classifiers using a given criterion over the region\nof competence of the test sample (its the nearest neighbors in the validation\nset). The K-Nearest Oracles Eliminate (KNORA-E) DES selects all classifiers\nthat correctly classify all samples in the region of competence of the test\nsample, if such classifier exists, otherwise, it removes from the region of\ncompetence the sample that is furthest from the test sample, and the process\nrepeats. When the region of competence has samples of different classes,\nKNORA-E can reduce the region of competence in such a way that only samples of\na single class remain in the region of competence, leading to the selection of\nlocally incompetent classifiers that classify all samples in the region of\ncompetence as being from the same class. In this paper, we propose two DES\ntechniques: K-Nearest Oracles Borderline (KNORA-B) and K-Nearest Oracles\nBorderline Imbalanced (KNORA-BI). KNORA-B is a DES technique based on KNORA-E\nthat reduces the region of competence but maintains at least one sample from\neach class that is in the original region of competence. KNORA-BI is a\nvariation of KNORA-B for imbalance datasets that reduces the region of\ncompetence but maintains at least one minority class sample if there is any in\nthe original region of competence. Experiments are conducted comparing the\nproposed techniques with 19 DES techniques from the literature using 40\ndatasets. The results show that the proposed techniques achieved interesting\nresults, with KNORA-BI outperforming state-of-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 23:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

We\nbegin by exploring a general \"simulate-and-infer\" strategy for such inference\nproblems where the center simulates the desired number of samples from the\nunknown distribution and applies standard inference algorithms for the\ncollocated setting.

We first mathematically prove that class localization maps can be\nobtained by directly selecting the class-specific feature maps of the last\nconvolutional layer, which paves a simple way to identify object regions. We\nthen present a simple network architecture including two parallel-classifiers\nfor object localization. Specifically, we leverage one classification branch to\ndynamically localize some discriminative object regions during the forward\npass. Although it is usually responsive to sparse parts of the target objects,\nthis classifier can drive the counterpart classifier to discover new and\ncomplementary object regions by erasing its discovered regions from the feature\nmaps. With such an adversarial learning, the two parallel-classifiers are\nforced to leverage complementary object regions for classification and can\nfinally generate integral object localization together. The merits of ACoL are\nmainly two-fold: 1) it can be trained in an end-to-end manner; 2) dynamically\nerasing enables the counterpart classifier to discover complementary object\nregions more effectively. We demonstrate the superiority of our ACoL approach\nin a variety of experiments. In particular, the Top-1 localization error rate\non the ILSVRC dataset is 45.14%, which is the new state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 01:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}

All the results show the EUV wave is a fast-mode\nmagnetohydrodynamic shock wave, likely triggered by the flare impulses. We\nsuggest that part of the EUV wave was probably trapped in the closed magnetic\nfields of streamer-like structure, and upward SWs possibly resulted from the\nrelease of trapped waves in the form of slow-mode. It is believed that an\ninterplay of the strong compression of the coronal shock and the configuration\nof the streamer-like structure is crucial for the formation of upward SWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 05:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

However, there are many unwanted attributes that\nconstrain the potentials of TIR tracking, such as the absence of visual color\npatterns and low resolutions. Recently, structured output support vector\nmachine (SOSVM) and discriminative correlation filter (DCF) have been\nsuccessfully applied to visible object tracking, respectively. Motivated by\nthese, in this paper, we propose a large margin structured convolution operator\n(LMSCO) to achieve efficient TIR object tracking.

Finally, a collaborative optimization\nstrategy is exploited to significantly update the operators.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\nincorporate the advantages of DCF and SOSVM for TIR object tracking.\nComprehensive evaluations on two thermal infrared tracking benchmarks, i.e.\nVOT-TIR2015 and VOT-TIR2016, clearly demonstrate that our LMSCO tracker\nachieves impressive results and outperforms most state-of-the-art trackers in\nterms of accuracy and robustness with sufficient frame rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 06:12:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 08:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

The problem is challenging as it needs the\nunderstanding of both video and sentence. Existing research predominantly\nemploys a costly \"scan and localize\" framework, neglecting the global video\ncontext and the specific details within sentences which play as critical issues\nfor this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention Based Location\nRegression (ABLR) approach to solve the temporal sentence localization from a\nglobal perspective.

We propose a novel approach for the\nnumerical approximation of such heterogeneous systems combining, for the first\ntime: (1) a dual mixed hybrid (DMH) finite element method (FEM) based on the\nlowest order Raviart-Thomas space (RT0); (2) a Three-Field (3F) formulation;\nand (3) a Streamline Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization method. Using\nthe abstract theory for generalized saddle-point problems and their\napproximation, we show that the weak formulation of the proposed method and its\nnumerical counterpart are both uniquely solvable and that the resulting finite\nelement scheme enjoys optimal convergence properties with respect to the\ndiscretization parameter. In addition, an efficient implementation of the\nproposed formulation is presented. The implementation is based on a systematic\nuse of static condensation which reduces the method to a nonconforming finite\nelement approach on a grid made by three-dimensional simplices. Extensive\ncomputational tests demonstrate the theoretical conclusions and indicate that\nthe proposed DMH-RT0 FEM scheme is accurate and stable even in the presence of\nmarked interface jump discontinuities in the solution and its associated normal\nflux.

A tight criterion under which the \\emph{abstract} version LLL (ALLL)\nholds was given by Shearer. It turns out that Shearer's bound is generally not\ntight for \\emph{variable} version LLL (VLLL).

As a by-product of our analysis we introduce a class of\nBayesian nonparametric estimators (predictors) which can be thought of as\nGood-Turing type estimators for ancestral inference. The proposed approach is\nillustrated through an application to genetic data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 10:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}

Our model consists of a two-stream network\n(one stream for appearance map extraction and the other one for body part map\nextraction) and a bilinear-pooling layer that generates and spatially pools a\npart-aligned map. Each local feature of the part-aligned map is obtained by a\nbilinear mapping of the corresponding local appearance and body part\ndescriptors. Our new representation leads to a robust image matching\nsimilarity, which is equivalent to an aggregation of the local similarities of\nthe corresponding body parts combined with the weighted appearance similarity.\nThis part-aligned representation reduces the part misalignment problem\nsignificantly. Our approach is also advantageous over other pose-guided\nrepresentations (e.g., extracting representations over the bounding box of each\nbody part) by learning part descriptors optimal for person re-identification.\nFor training the network, our approach does not require any part annotation on\nthe person re-identification dataset.

Intuitively, the players enter the game sequentially and choose an\noptimal action under the assumption that the $k-1$ subsequent players play\nsubgame-perfectly. Our model naturally interpolates between outcomes of greedy\nbest-response ($k=1$) and subgame-perfect outcomes ($k=n$, the number of\nplayers). We study the impact of limited lookahead (parameterized by $k$) on\nthe stability and inefficiency of the resulting outcomes. As our results\nreveal, increased lookahead does not necessarily lead to better outcomes; in\nfact, its effect crucially depends on the existence of ties and the type of\ngame under consideration.\n  More specifically, already for very simple network congestion games we show\nthat subgame-perfect outcomes (full lookahead) can be unstable, whereas greedy\nbest-response outcomes (no lookahead) are known to be stable. We show that this\ninstability is due to player indifferences (ties). If the game is generic (no\nties exist) then all outcomes are stable, independent of the lookahead $k$. In\nparticular, this implies that the price of anarchy of $k$-lookahead outcomes\n(for arbitrary $k$) equals the standard price of anarchy. For special cases of\ncost-sharing games and consensus games we show that no lookahead leads to\nstable outcomes. Again this can be resolved by removing ties, though for\ncost-sharing games only full lookahead provides stable outcomes. We also\nidentify a class of generic cost-sharing games for which the inefficiency\ndecreases as the lookahead $k$ increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 12:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}

Yet, both distributions have been discussed in mostly\nseparate communities. Here, we study both patterns simultaneously using a\nspatially explicit, evolutionary community assembly approach. We present and\ninvestigate a metacommunity model, consisting of a grid of patches, where each\npatch contains a local food web. Species survival depends on predation and\ncompetition interactions, which in turn depend on species body masses as the\nkey traits. The system evolves due to the migration of species to neighboring\npatches, the addition of new species as modifications of existing species, and\nlocal extinction events. The structure of each local food web thus emerges in a\nself-organized manner as the highly non-trivial outcome of the relative time\nscales of these processes. Our model generates a large variety of complex,\nmulti-trophic networks and therefore serves as a powerful tool to investigate\necosystems on long temporal and large spatial scales.

However, since the Cherenkov angle depends only on\nmaterial's permittivity, the material unavoidably sets a fundamental limit to\nthe momentum coverage and sensitivity of Cherenkov detectors. For example, Ring\nImaging Cherenkov detectors must employ materials transparent to the frequency\nof interest as well as possessing permittivities close to unity to identify\nparticles in the multi GeV range, and thus are often limited to large gas\nchambers. It would be extremely important albeit challenging to lift this\nfundamental limit and control Cherenkov angles as preferred. Here we propose a\nnew mechanism that uses constructive interference of resonance transition\nradiation from photonic crystals to generate both forward and backward\nCherenkov radiation. This mechanism can control Cherenkov angles in a flexible\nway with high sensitivity to any desired range of velocities. Photonic crystals\nthus overcome the severe material limit for Cherenkov detectors, enabling the\nuse of transparent materials with arbitrary values of permittivity, and provide\na promising option suited for identification of particles at high energy with\nenhanced sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 12:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Previous theoretical\nstudies assume the atmosphere of KELT-9b to be in chemical equilibrium. Despite\nthe high ultraviolet flux from KELT-9, we show using photochemical kinetics\ncalculations that the observable atmosphere of KELT-9b is predicted to be close\nto chemical equilibrium, which greatly simplifies any theoretical\ninterpretation of its spectra. It also makes the atmosphere of KELT-9b, which\nis expected to be cloudfree, a tightly constrained chemical system that lends\nitself to a clean set of theoretical predictions. Due to the lower pressures\nprobed in transmission (compared to emission) spectroscopy, we predict the\nabundance of water to vary by several orders of magnitude across the\natmospheric limb depending on temperature, which makes water a sensitive\nthermometer. Carbon monoxide is predicted to be the dominant molecule under a\nwide range of scenarios, rendering it a robust diagnostic of the metallicity\nwhen analyzed in tandem with water. All of the other usual suspects (acetylene,\nammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, methane) are predicted to be\nsubdominant at solar metallicity, while atomic oxygen, iron and magnesium are\npredicted to have relative abundances as high as 1 part in 10,000. Neutral\natomic iron is predicted to be seen through a forest of optical and\nnear-infrared lines, which makes KELT-9b suitable for high-resolution\nground-based spectroscopy with HARPS-N or CARMENES.

The\nnova speed class is unknown because of lack of the earliest half of optical\nlight curve and short supersoft X-ray phase due to eclipse by the disk rim.\nUsing the universal decline law and time-stretching method, we analyzed the\ndata of V959 Mon and obtained nova parameters. We estimated the distance\nmodulus in the V band to be (m-M)_V=13.15\\pm0.3 for the reddening of\nE(B-V)=0.38\\pm0.01 by directly comparing with the similar type of novae, LV\nVul, V1668 Cyg, IV Cep, and V1065 Cen.

If we assume that the early phase light curve of V959 Mon is the same as\nthat of time-stretched light curves of LV Vul, our model light curve fitting\nsuggests that the white dwarf (WD) mass is 0.9-1.15 M_sun, being consistent\nwith a neon nova identification.

For two-class\nimbalanced problems, the classification success is typically measured by the\ngeometric mean (GM) of the true positive and true negative rates. Here we prove\nthat GM can be improved upon by instance selection, and give the theoretical\nconditions for such an improvement. We demonstrate that GM is non-monotonic\nwith respect to the number of retained instances, which discourages systematic\ninstance selection. We also show that balancing the distribution frequencies is\ninferior to a direct maximisation of GM. To verify our theoretical findings, we\ncarried out an experimental study of 12 instance selection methods for\nimbalanced data, using 66 standard benchmark data sets.

Today the effect is still\ndiscussed in elementary physics courses to demonstrate that the angular\nmomentum associated with the aligned electron spins in a ferromagnet can be\nconverted to mechanical angular momentum by reversing the direction of\nmagnetisation using an external magnetic field. In recent times, a related\nproblem in magnetism concerns the time-scale over which this angular momentum\ntransfer can occur. It is known experimentally for several metallic\nferromagnets that intense photoexcitation leads to a drop in the magnetisation\non a time scale shorter than 100 fs, a phenomenon called ultrafast\ndemagnetisation. The microscopic mechanism for this process has been hotly\ndebated, with one key question still unanswered: where does the angular\nmomentum go on these sub-picosecond time scales? Here we show using femtosecond\ntime-resolved x-ray diffraction that a large fraction of the angular momentum\nlost from the spin system on the laserinduced demagnetisation of ferromagnetic\niron is transferred to the lattice on sub-picosecond timescales, manifesting as\na transverse strain wave that propagates from the surface into the bulk. By\nfitting a simple model of the x-ray data to simulations and optical data, we\nroughly estimate that the angular momentum occurs on a time scale of 200 fs and\ncorresponds to 80% of the angular momentum lost from the spin system. Our\nresults show that interaction with the lattice plays an essential role in the\nprocess of ultrafast demagnetisation in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 13:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 17:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

After appropriately normalizing the\nfields, the conformally coupled scalar only interacts directly with the\nwould-be Higgs field through kinetic-mixing and Higgs-portal terms. Thus, for\nthe first time, we describe the equivalence of conformally coupled\nscalar-tensor modifications of gravity and Higgs-portal theories, and we find\nthat the usual tree-level fifth forces only emerge if there is mass mixing\nbetween the conformally coupled scalar and the Higgs field.

As evidenced by our micromagnetic simulations,\nskyrmions can hardly be driven by either a static electric field or a static\nmagnetic field alone. Although the magnetic anisotropy can be modified by an\nelectric field, parametric pumping with an oscillating electric field can only\nexcite the breathing modes. On the other hand, a static magnetic field can\nbreak rotational symmetry through the Zeeman interaction, but it cannot serve\nas an energy source for propelling a skyrmion.

The most efficient driving occurs when the frequency\nof the oscillating field is close to that of the breathing motion.

Valid statistical tests are\nrequired to have a size that is smaller than a predefined significance level,\nand different tests usually have power against a different class of\nalternatives.

Public safety networks accommodate\npublic safety communication (PSC) applications to track the location of its\nutilizers and enable to sustain transmissions even in the crucial scenarios.\nDespite that, if the traditional setups responsible for PSCs are unavailable,\nit becomes prodigiously arduous to handle any of the safety applications, which\nmay cause havoc in the society. Dependence on a secondary network may assist to\nsolve such an issue. But, the secondary networks should be facilely deployable\nand must not cause exorbitant overheads in terms of cost and operation. For\nthis, LoRaWAN can be considered as an ideal solution as it provides low power\nand long-range communication. However, an excessive utilization of the\nsecondary network may result in high depletion of its own resources and can\nlead to a complete shutdown of services, which is a quandary at hand. As a\nsolution, this paper proposes a novel network model via a combination of\nLoRaWAN and traditional public safety networks, and uses a self-enforcing\nagreement based game theory for allocating resources efficiently amongst the\navailable servers. The proposed approach adopts memory and energy constraints\nas agreements, which are satisfied through Nash equilibrium. The numerical\nresults show that the proposed approach is capable of efficiently allocating\nthe resources with sufficiently high gains for resource conservation, network\nsustainability, resource restorations and probability to continue at the\npresent conditions even in the complete absence of traditional Access Points\n(APs) compared with a baseline scenario with no failure of nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 14:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}

We re-compute heliocentric orbits for the\n25 meteorite falls published to date from original data sources. Using these\norbits, we constrain their most likely escape routes from the main asteroid\nbelt and the cometary region by utilizing a state-of-the-art orbit model of the\nnear-Earth-object population, which includes a size-dependence in delivery\nefficiency. While we find that our general results for escape routes are\ncomparable to previous work, the role of trajectory measurement uncertainty in\nescape-route identification is explored for the first time.

To circumvent this drawback, motivated by the\nDivide-and-Conquer strategy, we propose Multi-view Hybrid Embedding (MvHE), a\nunique method of dividing the problem of cross-view classification into three\nsubproblems and building one model for each subproblem. Specifically, the first\nmodel is designed to remove view discrepancy, whereas the second and third\nmodels attempt to discover the intrinsic nonlinear structure and to increase\ndiscriminability in intra-view and inter-view samples respectively.

The approach utilizes Gaussian process regression\nto perform Bayesian inference on the parameter-to-observation map describing\nthe quantity of interest.

The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A\nlinear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude wave\nstructures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam\nvelocity and density.

If prime numbers were distributed\nrandomly, we would expect the two polynomials to generate the same number of\nprimes. Instead, as the reported findings show, we note that the polynomial\n$5+6n$ tends to generate many more primes, and that this divergence grows\nprogressively as more prime numbers are considered. A possible explanation for\nthis phenomenon can be found by calculating the number of products that\ngenerate composite numbers which are expressible by the two polynomials.

Various diagnostic\ntechniques were employed to evaluate the parameters of uCAP devices with\ndifferent lengths such as potential distribution, electron density, and optical\nemission spectroscopy. The generation of short- and long-lived species (such as\nhydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrite\n(NO2-), et al) were studied. These data revealed that uCAP treatment with a 20\nmm length tube has a stronger effect than that of the 60 mm tube due to the\nsynergetic effects of reactive species and free radicals. Reactive species\ngenerated by uCAP enhanced tumor cell death in a dose-dependent fashion and was\nnot specific with regards to tumor cell type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 21:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

Each particle, or signal, moves\nat constant speed in continuous time and space. When signals meet, they get\nreplaced by other signals. A signal machine defines the types of available\nsignals, their speeds and the rules for replacement in collision. A signal\nmachine A simulates another one B if all the space-time diagrams of B can be\ngenerated from space-time diagrams of A by removing some signals and renaming\nother signals according to local information. Given any finite set of speeds S,\nwe construct a signal machine that is able to simulate any signal machine whose\nspeeds belong to S. Each signal is simulated by a macro-signal, a ray of\nparallel signals. Each macro-signal has a main signal located exactly where the\nsimulated signal would be, as well as auxiliary signals which encode its id and\nthe collision rules of the simulated machine. The simulation of a collision, a\nmacro-collision, consists of two phases. In the first phase, macro-signals are\nshrunk, then the macro-signals involved in the collision are identified and it\nis ensured that no other macro-signal comes too close. If some do, the process\nis aborted and the macro-signals are shrunk, so that the correct\nmacro-collision will eventually be restarted and successfully initiated.\nOtherwise, the second phase starts: the appropriate collision rule is found and\nnew macro-signals are generated accordingly. Considering all finite set of\nspeeds S and their corresponding simulators provides an intrinsically universal\nfamily of signal machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 15:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 12:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

In this\nstudy, a new framework of modeling is suggested. Compared with other popular\nmethods, a distinctive characteristic is \"from image based model to analysis\nbased model (e.g. stress, strain, and deformation)\". In such a framework, a\nreconstruction neural network (ReConNN) model designed for simulation-based\nphysical field's reconstruction is proposed. The ReConNN contains two submodels\nthat are convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial net-work\n(GAN). The CNN is employed to construct the mapping between contour images of\nphysical field and objective function. Subsequently, the GAN is utilized to\ngenerate more images which are similar to the existing contour images. Finally,\nLagrange polynomial is applied to complete the reconstruction. However, the\nexisting CNN models are commonly applied to the classification tasks, which\nseem to be difficult to handle with regression tasks of images. Meanwhile, the\nexisting GAN architectures are insufficient to generate high-accuracy \"pseudo\ncontour images\". Therefore, a ReConNN model based on a Convolution in\nConvolution (CIC) and a Convolutional AutoEncoder based on Wasserstein\nGenerative Adversarial Network (WGAN-CAE) is suggested. To evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed model representatively, a classical topology\noptimization procedure is considered. Then the ReConNN is utilized to the\nreconstruction of heat transfer process of a pin fin heat sink. It demonstrates\nthat the proposed ReConNN model is proved to be a potential capability to\nreconstruct physical field for multidisciplinary, such as structural\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 08:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 00:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 02:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}
