However, it is recently found that a small number of objects can\nexhibit properties of both asteroids and comets. Some are more consistent with\nasteroids despite episodic ejections and are labeled as \"active asteroids\",\nwhile some might be aging comets with depleting volatiles. Ejecta produced by\nactive asteroids and/or dormant comets are potentially detectable as meteor\nshowers at the Earth if they are in Earth-crossing orbits, allowing us to\nretrieve information about the historic activities of these objects. Meteor\nshowers from small bodies with low and/or intermittent activities are usually\nweak, making shower confirmation and parent association challenging. We show\nthat statistical tests are useful for identifying likely parent-shower pairs.\nComprehensive analyses of physical and dynamical properties of meteor showers\ncan lead to deepen understanding on the history of their parents. Meteor\noutbursts can trace to recent episodic ejections from the parents, and \"orphan\"\nshowers may point to historic disintegration events. The flourish of NEO and\nmeteor surveys during the past decade has produced a number of high-confidence\nparent-shower associations, most have not been studied in detail. More work is\nneeded to understand the formation and evolution of these parent-shower pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 16:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The first and third steps involve an ordinary\ndifferential equation, which can be solved analytically. The intermediate step\ninvolves a 3D linear fractional diffusion equation, which is solved by the\nCrank-Nicolson alternating directional implicit (ADI) method. The ADI technique\ncan convert the multidimensional problem into a series of one-dimensional\nproblems, which greatly reduces the computational cost. A fourth-order\ndifference scheme is adopted for discretization of the space fractional\nderivatives. Finally, Richardson extrapolation is exploited to increase the\ntemporal accuracy. The proposed method is shown to be unconditionally stable by\nFourier analysis. Another contribution of this paper is to show that the\nnumerical solutions satisfy the discrete maximum principle under reasonable\ntime step constraint. For fabricated smooth solutions, numerical results show\nthat the proposed method is unconditionally stable and fourth-order accurate in\nboth time and space variables. In addition, the discrete maximum principle is\nalso numerically verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 16:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-20"}

[1] we analyzed the behavior of these\nclumps, assuming spherical symmetry, allowing for both attractive and repulsive\nself-interactions. There is a maximum allowed mass for the clumps in the case\nof attractive interactions, and a minimum radius for the clumps in the case of\nrepulsive interactions, which is saturated at large mass. Here we extend this\nwork to include non-spherically symmetric clumps. Since the system tries to\nre-organize into a BEC ground state, we consider configurations with a\nconserved non-zero angular momentum, and construct minimum energy\nconfigurations at fixed particle number and fixed angular momentum. We find\ngeneralizations of the previous spherically symmetric results. In particular,\nwhile there is still a maximum mass for the attractive case, its value\nincreases with angular momentum. Also, the minimum radius in the repulsive case\nis raised to higher radii. We clarify how a recent claim in the literature of\nan upper bound on angular momentum is due to inaccurate numerics.

However, mechanical systems have remained a\nchallenge, with only indirect demonstrations of mechanical state\nsuperpositions, in spite of the intellectual appeal and technical utility such\na capability would bring. This is due in part to the highly linear response of\nmost mechanical systems, making quantum operation difficult, as well as their\ncharacteristically low frequencies, making it difficult to reach the quantum\nground state. In this work, we demonstrate full quantum control of the\nmechanical state of a macroscopic mechanical resonator. We strongly couple a\nsurface acoustic wave resonator to a superconducting qubit, using the qubit to\ncontrol and measure quantum states in the mechanical resonator. Most notably,\nwe generate a quantum superposition of the zero and one phonon states and map\nthis and other states using Wigner tomography. This precise, programmable\nquantum control is essential to a range of applications of surface acoustic\nwaves in the quantum limit, including using surface acoustic waves to couple\ndisparate quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

We develop a functional generalization of stochastic quasi-gradient\nmethod to solve it, which, owing to the structure of the RKHS, admits a\nparameterization in terms of scalar weights and past state-action pairs which\ngrows proportionately with the algorithm iteration index. To ameliorate this\ncomplexity explosion, we apply Kernel Orthogonal Matching Pursuit to the\nsequence of kernel weights and dictionaries, which yields a controllable error\nin the descent direction of the underlying optimization method.

Linear\ndimensionality reduction methods such as Independent component analysis (ICA)\nand Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are commonly employed to reduce the\ndimensionality of HSI. These methods fail to capture non-linear dependency in\nthe HSI data, as data lies in the nonlinear manifold. To handle this, nonlinear\ntransformation techniques based on kernel methods were introduced for\ndimensionality reduction of HSI. However, the kernel methods involve cubic\ncomputational complexity while computing the kernel matrix, and thus its\npotential cannot be explored when the number of pixels (samples) are large. In\nliterature a fewer number of pixels are randomly selected to partial to\novercome this issue, however this sub-optimal strategy might neglect important\ninformation in the HSI.

The measurement-based model provides a concrete manifestation of\ncontextuality as a computational resource, as follows. If local measurements on\na multi-qubit state can be used to evaluate non-linear boolean functions with\nonly linear control processing, then this computation constitutes a proof of\nstrong contextuality - the possible local measurement outcomes cannot all be\npre-assigned. However, this connection is restricted to the special case when\nthe local measured systems are qubits, which have unusual properties from the\nperspective of contextuality. A single qubit cannot allow for a proof of\ncontextuality, unlike higher-dimensional systems, and multiple qubits can allow\nfor state-independent contextuality with only Pauli observables, again unlike\nhigher-dimensional generalisations. Here we identify precisely that strong\nnon-locality is necessary in a qudit measurement-based computation that\nevaluates high-degree polynomial functions with only linear control. We\nintroduce the concept of local universality, which places a bound on the space\nof output functions accessible under the constraint of single-qudit\nmeasurements. Thus, the partition of a physical system into subsystems plays a\ncrucial role for the increase in computational power. A prominent feature of\nour setting is that the enabling resources for qubit and qudit\nmeasurement-based computations are of the same underlying nature, avoiding the\npathologies associated with qubit contextuality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 20:15:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 06:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 03:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

Numerical examples demonstrate improved\nVolterra series estimation up to the 4th order using the regularized basis\nfunction method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 02:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

It is assumed that the seller knows \"each\nsingle bit\" of the distributions and is able to optimize perfectly based on the\nentire distributions. Unfortunately, this is a strong assumption and may not\nhold in reality: for example, when the value distributions have exponentially\nlarge supports or do not have succinct representations.\n  In this work we consider, for the first time, the query complexity of\nBayesian mechanisms. We only allow the seller to have limited oracle accesses\nto the players' value distributions, via quantile queries and value queries.\nFor a large class of auction settings, we prove logarithmic lower-bounds for\nthe query complexity for any DSIC Bayesian mechanism to be of any constant\napproximation to the optimal revenue. For single-item auctions and multi-item\nauctions with unit-demand or additive valuation functions, we prove tight\nupper-bounds via efficient query schemes, without requiring the distributions\nto be regular or have monotone hazard rate.

In order to alleviate the effects of\nview variations, this paper introduces a novel view adaptation scheme, which\nautomatically determines the virtual observation viewpoints in a learning based\ndata driven manner. We design two view adaptive neural networks, i.e., VA-RNN\nbased on RNN, and VA-CNN based on CNN. For each network, a novel view\nadaptation module learns and determines the most suitable observation\nviewpoints, and transforms the skeletons to those viewpoints for the end-to-end\nrecognition with a main classification network. Ablation studies find that the\nproposed view adaptive models are capable of transforming the skeletons of\nvarious viewpoints to much more consistent virtual viewpoints which largely\neliminates the viewpoint influence. In addition, we design a two-stream scheme\n(referred to as VA-fusion) that fuses the scores of the two networks to provide\nthe fused prediction.

This lies in contrast to\nthe situation in high dimensional spaces, where except for the work of\nHar-Peled, Indyk and Sidiropoulos (SODA 2013), who showed that any $n$-point\nEuclidean metric has an $O(t)$-spanner with $\\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/t^2})$ edges,\nlittle is known.\n  In this paper we study several aspects of spanners in high dimensional normed\nspaces. First, we build spanners for finite subsets of $\\ell_p$ with $1<p\\le\n2$. Second, our construction yields a spanner which is both sparse and also\n{\\em light}, i.e., its total weight is not much larger than that of the minimum\nspanning tree. In particular, we show that any $n$-point subset of $\\ell_p$ for\n$1<p\\le 2$ has an $O(t)$-spanner with $n^{1+\\tilde{O}(1/t^p)}$ edges and\nlightness $n^{\\tilde{O}(1/t^p)}$.\n  In fact, our results are more general, and they apply to any metric space\nadmitting a certain low diameter stochastic decomposition. It is known that\narbitrary metric spaces have an $O(t)$-spanner with lightness $O(n^{1/t})$. We\nexhibit the following tradeoff: metrics with decomposability parameter\n$\\nu=\\nu(t)$ admit an $O(t)$-spanner with lightness $\\tilde{O}(\\nu^{1/t})$. For\nexample, $n$-point Euclidean metrics have $\\nu\\le n^{1/t}$, metrics with\ndoubling constant $\\lambda$ have $\\nu\\le\\lambda$, and graphs of genus $g$ have\n$\\nu\\le g$. While these families do admit a ($1+\\epsilon$)-spanner, its\nlightness depend exponentially on the dimension (resp. $\\log g$).

The electric\nfield E is gauge invariant, but its capacity of being the canonical momentum is\nnot. \" The wrong emphasis as summarized by G.K{\\'o}nya al. would be: \"The use\nof the canonical coordinate/momentum pair A p and E in Poincar{\\'e} gauge is\npresented as mandatory in Rousseau and Felbacq paper, whereas as there is a\ncertain freedom of choice in selecting this pair.

When sequential data assimilation\nis considered, the joint distribution of the latent state and the observations\nis described mathematically using a state-space model, and filtering or\nsmoothing algorithms are used to approximate the conditional distribution of\nthe state given the observations. The most popular algorithms in the data\nassimilation community are based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter and Smoother\n(EnKF/EnKS) and its extensions. In this paper we investigate an alternative\napproach where a Conditional Particle Filter (CPF) is combined with Backward\nSimulation (BS). This allows to explore efficiently the latent space and\nsimulate quickly relevant trajectories of the state conditionally to the\nobservations. We also tackle the difficult problem of parameter estimation.\nIndeed, the models generally involve statistical parameters in the physical\nmodels and/or in the stochastic models for the errors. These parameters\nstrongly impact the results of the data assimilation algorithm and there is a\nneed for an efficient method to estimate them. Expectation-Maximization (EM) is\nthe most classical algorithm in the statistical literature to estimate the\nparameters in models with latent variables. It consists in updating\nsequentially the parameters by maximizing a likelihood function where the state\nis approximated using a smoothing algorithm. In this paper, we propose an\noriginal Stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm combined to the\nCPF-BS smoother to estimate the statistical parameters. We show on several toy\nmodels that this algorithm provides, with reasonable computational cost,\naccurate estimations of the statistical parameters and the state in highly\nnonlinear state-space models, where the application of EM algorithms using EnKS\nis limited.

To\nfacilitate the device applications, there are three key requirements for a\nmaterial: sizeable band gap, high carrier mobility and robust environmental\nstability. However, for the hottest 2D materials studied in recent years,\ngraphene is gapless, transition metal dichalcogenides have low carrier\nmobility, and black phosphorene is environmentally sensitive. So far, these\nthree characteristics can seldom be satisfied in one single material.\nTherefore, it becomes a great challenge for finding an ideal 2D material to\novercome such a limitation. In this work, we theoretically predict a novel\nplanar 2D material: Penta-Pt2N4, which are designed by the fantastic Cario\npentagonal tiling as well as the rare nitrogen double bond. Most significantly,\nthe 2D Penta-Pt2N4 exhibits excellent intrinsic properties, including large\ndirect band gap up to 1.51 eV, high carrier mobility up to 105 cm2V-1s-1, giant\nYoung's module up to 0.70 TPa, and robust dynamic, thermal and chemical\nstability. Moreover, Penta-Pt2N4 is a global minimal with PtN2 stoichiometry in\n2D, so we also propose a CVD/MBE scheme to enable its experimental synthesis.\nWe envision that the 2D Penta-Pt2N4 may find a wide application for future\nnanoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 08:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

Braess' paradox constitutes a counterintuitive collective phenomenon\nthat occurs if adding new transmission line capacity to a network increases\nloads on other lines, effectively reducing the system's performance and\npotentially even entirely removing its operating state. Combining simple\nanalytical considerations with numerical investigations on a small sample\nnetwork, we here study dynamical consequences of secondary control in AC power\ngrid models. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong control not only implies\ndynamical stability of the system but may also cure Braess' paradox. Our\nresults highlight the importance of demand control in conjunction with grid\ntopology for stable operation and reveal a new functional benefit of secondary\ncontrol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 09:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Optimal production capacities are installed\nchoosing from a range of well-established production and storage technologies\nincluding boilers, combined heat and power (CHP) units, power-to-heat\ntechnologies and heat storages. The optimal heat production system is\ncharacterized in three different electricity pricing scenarios: Historical,\nwind power dominated and demand dominated. Coal CHP, large heat pumps and heat\nstorages dominate the optimal system if fossil fuels are allowed. Heat pumps\nand storages take over if fossil fuels are excluded. The capacity allocation\nbetween CHP and heat pumps is highly dependent on cost assumptions in the\nfossil fuel scenario, but the optimal capacities become much more robust if\nfossil fuels are not included. System cost becomes less robust in a fossil free\nscenario. If the electricity pricing is dominated by wind power generation or\nby the electricity demand, heat pumps become more favorable compared to\ncogeneration units. The need for heat storage more than doubles, if fossil\nfuels are not included, as the heating system becomes more closely coupled to\nthe electricity system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 11:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

The provider therefore has to continuously decide\nwhether she can add additional workloads to a given cluster or if doing so\nwould impact existing workloads' ability to scale. Currently, this is often\ndone using simple threshold policies to reserve large parts of each cluster,\nwhich leads to low efficiency (i.e., low average utilization of the cluster).\nWe propose more sophisticated policies for controlling admission to a cluster\nand demonstrate that they significantly increase cluster utilization. We first\nintroduce the cluster admission problem and formalize it as a constrained\nPartially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). As it is infeasible to\nsolve the POMDP optimally, we then systematically design admission policies\nthat estimate moments of each workload's distribution of future resource usage.\nVia extensive simulations grounded in a trace from Microsoft Azure, we show\nthat our admission policies lead to a substantial improvement over the simple\nthreshold policy. We then show that substantial further gains are possible if\nhigh-quality information is available about arriving workloads. Based on this,\nwe propose an information elicitation approach to incentivize users to provide\nthis information and simulate its effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 12:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 17:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 10:05:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 12:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 14:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 09:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 16:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 16:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

Sorting\nperfectly in this model is impossible, and the objective is to minimize the\n\\emph{dislocation} of each element in the output sequence, that is, the\ndifference between its true rank and its position. Existing lower bounds for\nthis problem show that no algorithm can guarantee, with high probability,\n\\emph{maximum dislocation} and \\emph{total dislocation} better than\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ and $\\Omega(n)$, respectively, regardless of its running time.\n  In this paper, we present the first \\emph{$O(n\\log n)$-time} sorting\nalgorithm that guarantees both \\emph{$O(\\log n)$ maximum dislocation} and\n\\emph{$O(n)$ total dislocation} with high probability.

The structure\nof this object is complex, and the HCO$^+$ emission arises from the\ncontribution of a young NW-SE outflow, the proto-stellar envelope and the\nforeground cloud. We aim at constraining the physical parameters of these\nstructures using all the observed transitions.

While the use of large mini-batches increases\nthe available computational parallelism, small batch training has been shown to\nprovide improved generalization performance and allows a significantly smaller\nmemory footprint, which might also be exploited to improve machine throughput.\n  In this paper, we review common assumptions on learning rate scaling and\ntraining duration, as a basis for an experimental comparison of test\nperformance for different mini-batch sizes. We adopt a learning rate that\ncorresponds to a constant average weight update per gradient calculation (i.e.,\nper unit cost of computation), and point out that this results in a variance of\nthe weight updates that increases linearly with the mini-batch size $m$.\n  The collected experimental results for the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet\ndatasets show that increasing the mini-batch size progressively reduces the\nrange of learning rates that provide stable convergence and acceptable test\nperformance. On the other hand, small mini-batch sizes provide more up-to-date\ngradient calculations, which yields more stable and reliable training. The best\nperformance has been consistently obtained for mini-batch sizes between $m = 2$\nand $m = 32$, which contrasts with recent work advocating the use of mini-batch\nsizes in the thousands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 13:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

More interestingly, being core-dependent\n-larger in Pd@Pt and smaller in Ni@Pt-, it relates to an effective electron\ntransfer from ethanol and the M-core towards the Pt-shell. On the view of this\nnew analysis, Pd@Pt nanoalloys show the most promissing features for ethanol\noxidation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 14:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In gauge theories, the\nsituation is complicated by the fact that a covariant (w.r.t. the background\nfield) gauge fixing breaks this split independence of the action. Nevertheless,\nbackground independence is preserved on the observables, as defined via the\nBRST formalism, since the violation term is BRST exact. In quantized gauge\ntheories, however, BRST exactness of the violation term is not sufficient to\nguarantee background independence, due to potential anomalies. We define\nbackground independent observables in a geometrical formulation as flat\nsections of the observable algebra bundle over the manifold of background\nconfigurations, with respect to a flat connection which implements background\nvariations. A theory is then called background independent if such a flat\n(Fedosov) connection exists. We analyze the obstructions to preserve background\nindependence at the quantum level for pure Yang-Mills theory and for\nperturbative gravity. We find that in the former case all potential\nobstructions can be removed by finite renormalization.

Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the\nbanking system, thus facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees\nsuch as remittances, with a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities\ntogether with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and\nmade its price skyrocket during 2017. However, while the Bitcoin blockchain\nattracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this\nattention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and\nconsequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to\ncharacterize the adoption of the bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first\npart of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software\nclient downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and\nthe Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the\nsystem evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for\nuser adoption, we identified several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per\ncapita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables\ncorrelated with the degree of user adoption. In the second part of the work, we\nbuild a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP\naddresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of\nthe gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked\nto the flow of bitcoins between countries.

However, existing dialogue\npolicy transfer methods cannot transfer across dialogue domains with different\nspeech-acts, for example, between systems built by different companies. Also,\nthey depend on either common slots or slot entropy, which are not available\nwhen the source and target slots are totally disjoint and no database is\navailable to calculate the slot entropy. To solve this problem, we propose a\nPolicy tRansfer across dOMaIns and SpEech-acts (PROMISE) model, which is able\nto transfer dialogue policies across domains with different speech-acts and\ndisjoint slots. The PROMISE model can learn to align different speech-acts and\nslots simultaneously, and it does not require common slots or the calculation\nof the slot entropy. Experiments on both real-world dialogue data and\nsimulations demonstrate that PROMISE model can effectively transfer dialogue\npolicies across domains with different speech-acts and disjoint slots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

In its simple form, a\ncombinatorial strategy can reduce several input parameters (configurations) of\na system into a small set based on their interaction (or combination). In\npractice, the input configurations of software systems are subjected to\nconstraints, especially in case of highly configurable systems. To implement\nthis feature within a strategy, many difficulties arise for construction. While\nthere are many combinatorial interaction testing strategies nowadays, few of\nthem support constraints. Objective: This paper presents a new strategy, to\nconstruct combinatorial interaction test suites in the presence of constraints.\nMethod: The design and algorithms are provided in detail. To overcome the\nmulti-judgment criteria for an optimal solution, the multi-objective particle\nswarm optimization and multithreading are used. The strategy and its associated\nalgorithms are evaluated extensively using different benchmarks and\ncomparisons. Results: Our results are promising as the evaluation results\nshowed the efficiency and performance of each algorithm in the strategy. The\nbenchmarking results also showed that the strategy can generate constrained\ntest suites efficiently as compared to state-of-the-art strategies. Conclusion:\nThe proposed strategy can form a new way for constructing of constrained\ncombinatorial interaction test suites. The strategy can form a new and\neffective base for future implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

The induced lift force is\nattributed to an elastohydrodynamic coupling that arises from the breaking of\nthe flow reversal symmetry induced by the elastic deformation of the\ntranslating object or the interface. Here we derive explicit analytical\nexpressions for the quasi-steady state lift force exerted on a rigid spherical\nparticle translating parallel to a finite-sized membrane exhibiting a\nresistance toward both shear and bending. Our analytical approach proceeds\nthrough the application of the Lorentz reciprocal theorem so as to obtain the\nsolution of the flow problem using a perturbation technique for small\ndeformations of the membrane. We find that the shear-related contribution to\nthe normal force leads to an attractive interaction between the particle and\nthe membrane. This emerging attractive force decreases quadratically with the\nsystem size to eventually vanish in the limit of an infinitely-extended\nmembrane. In contrast, membrane bending leads to a repulsive interaction whose\neffect becomes more pronounced upon increasing the system size, where the lift\nforce is found to diverge logarithmically for an infinitely-large membrane. The\nunphysical divergence of the bending-induced lift force can be rendered finite\nby regularizing the solution with a cut-off length beyond which the bending\nforces become subdominant to an external body force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 17:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

One\nespecially effective technique is digital back propagation (DBP), an algorithm\ncapable of simultaneously compensating for linear and nonlinear channel\ndistortions. The most significant barrier to implementing this technique,\nhowever, is its high computational complexity. In recent years, there have been\nseveral proposed alternatives to DBP with reduced computational complexity,\nalthough such techniques have not demonstrated performance benefits\ncommensurate with the complexity of implementation. In order to fully\ncharacterize the computational requirements of DBP, there is a need to model\nthe algorithm behavior when constrained to the logic used in a digital coherent\nreceiver. Such a model allows for the analysis of any signal recovery algorithm\nin terms of true hardware complexity which, crucially, includes the bit-depth\nof the multiplication operation. With a limited bit depth, there is\nquantization noise, introduced with each arithmetic operation, and it can no\nlonger be assumed that the conventional DBP algorithm will outperform its low\ncomplexity alternatives.

We show that the answer to that\nquestion is sensitive to both the number of changes cells are allowed to make,\nand geometric features of the space.

However, some discrepancies have been\nobserved, highlighting underestimation of sorption process and overestimation\nof desorption process. Some studies intend to explain the discrepancies by\nanalysing the importance of hysteresis effects as well as carrying out\nsensitivity analyses on the input parameters as convective transfer\ncoefficients. This article intends to investigate the accuracy and efficiency\nof the coupled solution by adding advective transfer of both heat and moisture\nin the physical model. In addition, the efficient Scharfetter and Gummel\nnumerical scheme is proposed to solve the system of advection-diffusion\nequations, which has the advantages of being well-balanced and asymptotically\npreserving. Moreover, the scheme is particularly efficient in terms of accuracy\nand reduction of computational time when using large spatial discretisation\nparameters. Several linear and non-linear cases are studied to validate the\nmethod and highlight its specific features. At the end, an experimental\nbenchmark from the literature is considered. The numerical results are compared\nto the experimental data for a pure diffusive model and also for the proposed\nmodel. The latter presents better agreement with the experimental data. The\ninfluence of the hysteresis effects on the moisture capacity is also studied,\nby adding a third differential equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 09:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 14:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

However, challenges persist in baseline correction due to\nbackground radiation, causing non-linear interference with emission lines. This\nnecessitates proper baseline correction for accurate quantification of elements\nin LIBS spectra. Our study focuses on the quantification of total carbon in\nsoil samples, conducting a comparative analysis of filters and methods for\nnoise removal and baseline correction in LIBS spectra. We exhaustively tested\nall combinations of filters and methods, optimizing their parameters to\nestablish the strongest correlation between corrected spectra and carbon\ncontent in a training sample set. We then evaluated these combinations using\noptimized parameters on a separate test sample set. Through rigorous\nevaluation, we found that the combination of the Savitzky-Golay filter and the\n4S Peak Filling method achieved the most effective baseline correction. This\ncombination demonstrated a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.93 and a root\nmean square error of 0.21. Notably, it outperformed a linear regression model\nbased solely on the carbon emission line at 193.04 nm, which yielded a\ncorrelation of 0.91 with a root mean square error of 0.26. Our proposed\nprocedure presents a novel approach for baseline correction in LIBS spectra,\nopening new possibilities for the development of multivariate methods utilizing\nspecific spectral ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 16:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 22:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}
