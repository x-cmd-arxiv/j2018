The main objective of this paper\nis to present our code and use it to demonstrate and verify the now widely -\naccepted global features of a pulsar magnetosphere. Our results qualitatively\nagree with previously developed time-dependent models for an oblique rotator.\nIn line with earlier studies, we also demonstrate that our simulations can run\nfor many stellar rotations. Once we extend our code, we believe that our\nimplicit approach can be extremely useful to investigate magnetospheres filled\nwith resistive plasma, develop better resolution current sheets and investigate\nsmall scale microphysics of pair creation using particle-in-cell techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 16:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

In particular, the\neffect of non-uniform Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) levels on the spectral\nproperties of the generated signal is analyzed. It is analytically shown that\nthe DAC non-uniform levels result in degraded harmonic suppression performance.\nMoreover, a new approach is proposed for designing ternary sequences, which is\nflexible and can be adapted to suit different requirements. The resulting\nsequences, denoted as randomized constrained sequences, are characterized\ntheoretically by deriving an analytical expression of the power spectral\ndensity. Furthermore, they are extensively compared with three synthesis\napproaches proposed in the literature.

The LambdaCDM model, which is the standard and by far most\nsuccessful current cosmological model, faces what I call the downscaling\nproblem when it comes to explain some recalcitrant evidence at the scale of\nindividual galaxies, such as the mass-discrepancy acceleration relation (MDAR)\nand the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTF). While the fastgrowing development\nof computer simulations has addressed these problems, nagging worries remain\nabout some of the epistemic limits of these computer simulations in retrieving\n(as opposed to explaining) the data. The so-called upscaling problem affects\nMOND and its ability not just to explain but even simply retrieve large-scale\nstructure and galaxy clusters. Recent attempts at extending MOND (EMOND) have\nhad a limited empirical success, and are still far from providing a consistent\nexplanation for possible formation mechanisms at the large-scale structure.\nFinally, the in between scales problem affects proposals designed to achieve\nthe best of both worlds at the meso-scale.

However,\nlittle attention has been paid to the fact that the success of an information\ndiffusion campaign might depend not only on the number of the initial\ninfluencers to be detected but also on their diversity w.r.t. the target of the\ncampaign. Our main hypothesis is that if we learn seeds that are not only\ncapable of influencing but also are linked to more diverse (groups of) users,\nthen the influence triggers will be diversified as well, and hence the target\nusers will get higher chance of being engaged. Upon this intuition, we define a\nnovel problem, named Diversity-sensitive Targeted Influence Maximization\n(DTIM), which assumes to model user diversity by exploiting only topological\ninformation within a social graph. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to bring the concept of topology-driven diversity into targeted IM\nproblems, for which we define two alternative definitions. Accordingly, we\npropose approximate solutions of DTIM, which detect a size-k set of users that\nmaximizes the diversity-sensitive capital objective function, for a given\nselection of target users. We evaluate our DTIM methods on a special case of\nuser engagement in online social networks, which concerns users who are not\nactively involved in the community life. Experimental evaluation on real\nnetworks has demonstrated the meaningfulness of our approach, also highlighting\nthe opportunity of further development of solutions for DTIM applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 16:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-23"}

We present a new theoretical treatment for tidal\nheating in thin subsurface oceans with overlying incompressible elastic shells\nof arbitrary thickness. The stabilizing effect of an overlying shell damps\nocean tides, reducing tidal heating. This effect is more pronounced on\nEnceladus than on Europa because the effective rigidity on a small body like\nEnceladus is larger. For the range of likely shell and ocean thicknesses of\nEnceladus and Europa, the thin shell approximation of Beuthe (2016) is\ngenerally accurate to less than about 4%.The time-averaged surface distribution\nof ocean tidal heating is distinct from that due to dissipation in the solid\nshell, with higher dissipation near the equator and poles for eccentricity and\nobliquity forcing respectively. This can lead to unique horizontal shell\nthickness variations if the shell is conductive. The surface displacement\ndriven by eccentricity and obliquity forcing can have a phase lag relative to\nthe forcing tidal potential due to the delayed ocean response. For Europa and\nEnceladus, eccentricity forcing generally produces greater tidal amplitudes due\nto the large eccentricity values relative to the obliquity values. Despite the\nsmall obliquity values, obliquity forcing generally produces larger phase lags\ndue to the generation of Rossby-Haurwitz waves. If Europa's shell and ocean are\nrespectively 10 and 100 km thick, the tide amplitude and phase lag are 26.5 m\nand $<1$ degree for eccentricity forcing, and $<2.5$ m and $<18$ degrees for\nobliquity forcing.

Unresolved and unrecognized binaries give rise to systematic errors\nin planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets and mistakes in\ncompleteness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs,\nmaking it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates.\nHere we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try\nand clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate\ndensity measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The\nformula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary\nstars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and\nsingle stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries\nare over-represented in flux-limited samples. Application of the formula to an\nidealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 $R_\\oplus$,\nthe net systematic error is of order 5%. In particular, unrecognized binaries\nare unlikely to be the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot\nJupiter occurrence rates measured in different surveys. For smaller planets the\nerrors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be\noverestimated by as much as 50%. We also show that whenever high-resolution\nimaging reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more\nlikely to orbit the primary star than the secondary star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

This timescale, in turn, places a lower limit on the age of\nthe cluster.

Like Jupiter, it is predicted to have an atmosphere rich in\nmethane, water, and ammonia, with clouds of volatile ices. WISE 0855 is faint\nat near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its energy in the\nmid-infrared. Skemer et al. 2016 presented a spectrum of WISE 0855 from 4.5-5.1\nmicron (M band), revealing water vapor features. Here, we present a spectrum of\nWISE 0855 in L band, from 3.4-4.14 micron. We present a set of atmosphere\nmodels that include a range of compositions (metallicities and C/O ratios) and\nwater ice clouds. Methane absorption is clearly present in the spectrum. The\nmid-infrared color can be better matched with a methane abundance that is\ndepleted relative to solar abundance. We find that there is evidence for water\nice clouds in the M band spectrum, and we find a lack of phosphine spectral\nfeatures in both the L and M band spectra. We suggest that a deep continuum\nopacity source may be obscuring the near-infrared flux, possibly a deep\nphosphorous-bearing cloud, ammonium dihyrogen phosphate. Observations of WISE\n0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres, bridging the\ntemperature range between the long-studied solar system planets and accessible\nexoplanets. JWST will soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs\nwith high-precision spectroscopy across the infrared, allowing us to study\ntheir compositions and cloud properties, and to infer their atmospheric\ndynamics and formation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

The discrete model considered in\nthis paper is the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), which simulates\nconcrete at the level of coarse aggregate pieces. In LDPM, the size of the\naggregate particles follows the actual particle size distribution that is used\nin experiment to produce concrete specimens. Consequently, modeling large\nstructural systems entirely with LDPM leads to a tremendous number of degrees\nof freedom and is not feasible with the currently available computational\nresources. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the formulation of\na coarse-grained model obtained by (1) increasing the actual size of the\nparticles in the fine-scale model by a specific coarsening factor and (2)\ncalibrating the parameters of the coarse grained model by best fitting the\nmacroscopic, average response of the coarse grained model to the corresponding\nfine scale one for different loading conditions. A Representative Volume\nElement (RVE) of LDPM is employed to obtain the macroscopic response of the\nfine scale and coarse grained models through a homogenization procedure.\nAccuracy and efficiency of the developed coarse graining method is verified by\ncomparing the response of fine scale and coarse grained simulations of several\nreinforced concrete structural systems in terms of both accuracy of the results\nand computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 18:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

Materials and Methods: We propose a\ndistant supervision paradigm empowered by deep representation for extracting\ninformation from clinical text. In this paradigm, the rule-based NLP algorithms\nare utilized to generate weak labels and create large training datasets\nautomatically. Additionally, we use pre-trained word embeddings as deep\nrepresentation to eliminate the need of task-specific feature engineering for\nmachine learning. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm on\ntwo clinical information extraction tasks: smoking status extraction and\nproximal femur (hip) fracture extraction. We tested three prevalent machine\nlearning models, namely, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector\nMachine (SVM), and Random Forrest (RF). Results: The results indicate that CNN\nis the best fit to the proposed distant supervision paradigm. It outperforms\nthe rule-based NLP algorithms given large datasets by capturing additional\nextraction patterns. We also verified the advantage of word embedding feature\nrepresentation in the paradigm over term frequency-inverse document frequency\n(tf-idf) and topic modeling representations. Discussion: In the clinical\ndomain, the limited amount of labeled data is always a bottleneck for applying\nmachine learning. Additionally, the performance of machine learning approaches\nhighly depends on task-specific feature engineering.

More\nspecifically, we bring off a dynamic constellation by introducing secure shared\nrandomness between the legitimate transmitter and receiver, and hence break the\nsymmetricity between the authorized signal and the disguised jamming. We\nanalyze the channel capacities of both the traditional OFDM and SP-OFDM under\nhostile jamming using the arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) model. It is shown\nthat the deterministic coding capacity of the traditional OFDM is zero under\nthe worst disguised jamming. On the other hand, due to the secure randomness\nshared between the authorized transmitter and receiver, SP-OFDM can achieve a\npositive capacity under disguised jamming since the AVC channel corresponding\nto SP-OFDM is not symmetrizable. A remarkable feature of the proposed SP-OFDM\nscheme is that while achieving strong jamming resistance, it has roughly the\nsame high spectral efficiency as the traditional OFDM system. The robustness of\nthe proposed SP-OFDM scheme under disguised jamming is demonstrated through\nboth theoretic and numerical analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 19:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

In addition, the roots of the Lopatinskii determinant\nof the para-linearized system may coincide with the poles of the system. Such a\nnew collapsing phenomenon causes serious difficulties when applying the\nbicharacteristic extension method.

In addition, chiral phononic\nprocesses, which are necessary for conventional phononic quantum networks, are\ndifficult to implement in a solid-state system. To overcome these seemingly\nunsolvable obstacles, we have developed a new network architecture that breaks\na large mechanical network into small and closed mechanical subsystems.

Subjects from the RCT are placed in strata defined by the propensity\nthey would have had, had they been in the ODB. Our first method simply spikes\nthe RCT data into their corresponding ODB strata. Our second method takes a\ndata-driven convex combination of the ODB and RCT treatment effect estimates\nwithin each stratum. Using the delta method and simulations we show that the\nspike-in method works best when the RCT covariates are drawn from the same\ndistribution as in the ODB.

As more sources are detected, it will be possible to measure\nproperties of the local population of black holes and neutron stars, including\ntheir mass and spin distributions. Once at design sensitivity, existing\ninstruments will be able to detect heavy binary black holes at redshifts of\n$\\sim 1$. Significant upgrades in the current facilities could increase the\nsensitivity by another factor of few, further extending reach and\nsignal-to-noise ratio.

Third-generation gravitational-wave detectors have been proposed,\nwhich could observe most of the binary black holes merging anywhere in the\nuniverse. In this paper we check if and to which extent it makes sense to keep\nprevious-generation detectors up and running once a significantly more\nsensitive detector is online. First, we focus on a population of binary black\nholes with redshifts distributed uniformly in comoving volume. We show that\nmeasurement of extrinsic parameters, such as sky position, inclination and\nluminosity distance can significantly benefit from the presence of a less\nsensitive detector. Conversely, intrinsic parameters such as\n\\emph{detector-frame} masses and spins are largely unaffected. Measurement of\nthe \\emph{source-frame masses} is instead improved, owing to the improvement of\nthe distance measurement. Then, we focus on nearby events. We simulated sources\nsimilar to GW150914 and GW151226 and check how well their parameters can be\nmeasured by various networks.

In particular, we find\nthat reentrance is appreciable when the characteristic energy cost of the\nhomogeneous and modulated phases are comparable to each other, and for systems\nin which the local order parameter is limited. In the asymptotic limit of high\nenergy cost of the homogeneous phase we obtain analytically that the degree of\nreentrance of the phase diagram decreases exponentially with the ratio of the\ncharacteristic energy cost of homogeneous and modulated phases. We are also\nable to establish theoretical (upper and lower) bounds for the degree of the\nreentrance, according to the nature of the competing interactions.

These systems unfold three major\nphases: pool generation, selection and integration. One of the most promising\nMCS approaches is Dynamic Selection (DS), which relies on finding the most\ncompetent classifier or ensemble of classifiers to predict each test sample.\nThe majority of the DS techniques are based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)\ndefinition, and the quality of the neighborhood has a huge impact on the\nperformance of DS methods. In this paper, we perform an analysis comparing the\nclassification results of DS techniques and the K-NN classifier under different\nconditions. Experiments are performed on 18 state-of-the-art DS techniques over\n30 classification datasets and results show that DS methods present a\nsignificant boost in classification accuracy even though they use the same\nneighborhood as the K-NN. The reasons behind the outperformance of DS\ntechniques over the K-NN classifier reside in the fact that DS techniques can\ndeal with samples with a high degree of instance hardness (samples that are\nlocated close to the decision border) as opposed to the K-NN. In this paper,\nnot only we explain why DS techniques achieve higher classification performance\nthan the K-NN but also when DS should be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 03:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

Leading sparse sensing methods typically exploit either spatial\nor temporal correlations, but rarely both. This work introduces a new sparse\nsensor optimization that is designed to leverage the rich spatiotemporal\ncoherence exhibited by many systems. Our approach is inspired by the remarkable\nperformance of flying insects, which use a few embedded strain-sensitive\nneurons to achieve rapid and robust flight control despite large gust\ndisturbances. Specifically, we draw on nature to identify targeted\nneural-inspired sensors on a flapping wing to detect body rotation. This task\nis particularly challenging as the rotational twisting mode is three\norders-of-magnitude smaller than the flapping modes. We show that nonlinear\nfiltering in time, built to mimic strain-sensitive neurons, is essential to\ndetect rotation, whereas instantaneous measurements fail. Optimized sparse\nsensor placement results in efficient classification with approximately ten\nsensors, achieving the same accuracy and noise robustness as full measurements\nconsisting of hundreds of sensors. Sparse sensing with neural inspired encoding\nestablishes a new paradigm in hyper-efficient, embodied sensing of\nspatiotemporal data and sheds light on principles of biological sensing for\nagile flight control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 03:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

We speculate that\nthe space geometry stems as a geodesic tensor network which defines the quantum\nstate complexity of a fundamental quantum state under a given metric. Spacetime\ncorresponds to an evolving tensor network that generates an evolutional\nfundamental quantum system. This mechanism provides (a) a constructive\ncorrespondence between quantum states and spacetime geometry; (b)a spacetime\nstructure emerging from a highly constrained geodesic so that the QEC-like\nstructure shown in AdS/CFT can be naturally realized and (c) a mechanism to\nderive the gravity equation from the concept of quantum state complexity.

The outburst properties deduced from our\nsimulations suggest that, although the recurrent nova events observed in RS~Oph\nare due to a thermonuclear runaway at the white dwarf surface, these runaways\nare triggered by accretion disc instabilities. In quiescence, the disc builds\nup its mass and it is only during the disc-instability outburst that mass is\naccreted on to the white dwarf at rates comparable to or larger than the\nmass-transfer rate.

While making clear about behavior of the\npropensity score our analysis shows how the so-called prognostic score can be\nderived simultaneously. However the prognostic score is derived in a limited\nsense in the current literature whereas our derivation is more general and\nshows all possibilities of having the score. And we call it outcome score. We\nargue that application of both the propensity score and the outcome score is\nthe most efficient way for reduction of dimension in the confounding covariates\nas opposed to current belief that the propensity score alone is the most\nefficient way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 08:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

Expert finding in CQA often exhibits very different\nchallenges compared to traditional methods. Sparse data and new features\nviolate fundamental assumptions of traditional recommendation systems. This\npaper focuses on reviewing and categorizing the current progress on expert\nfinding in CQA. We classify all the existing solutions into four different\ncategories: matrix factorization based models (MF-based models), gradient\nboosting tree based models (GBT-based models), deep learning based models\n(DL-based models) and ranking based models (R-based models). We find that\nMF-based models outperform other categories of models in the field of expert\nfinding in CQA.

Further,\nwe compare the performance of different models on different types of matching\ntasks, including text vs. text, graph vs. text, audio vs. text and video vs.\ntext. The results can help the model selection of expert finding in practice.\nFinally, we explore some potential future issues in expert finding research in\nCQA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 12:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

To produce these phrase-structure representations from sentences in\nnatural language, shift-reduce constituent parsers have become one of the most\nefficient approaches. Increasing their accuracy and speed is still one of the\nmain objectives pursued by the research community so that artificial\nintelligence applications that make use of parsing outputs, such as machine\ntranslation or voice assistant services, can improve their performance. With\nthis goal in mind, we propose in this article a novel non-binary shift-reduce\nalgorithm for constituent parsing. Our parser follows a classical bottom-up\nstrategy but, unlike others, it straightforwardly creates non-binary branchings\nwith just one Reduce transition, instead of requiring prior binarization or a\nsequence of binary transitions, allowing its direct application to any language\nwithout the need of further resources such as percolation tables. As a result,\nit uses fewer transitions per sentence than existing transition-based\nconstituent parsers, becoming the fastest such system and, as a consequence,\nspeeding up downstream applications. Using static oracle training and greedy\nsearch, the accuracy of this novel approach is on par with state-of-the-art\ntransition-based constituent parsers and outperforms all top-down and bottom-up\ngreedy shift-reduce systems on the Wall Street Journal section from the English\nPenn Treebank and the Penn Chinese Treebank. Additionally, we develop a dynamic\noracle for training the proposed transition-based algorithm, achieving further\nimprovements in both benchmarks and obtaining the best accuracy to date on the\nPenn Chinese Treebank among greedy shift-reduce parsers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 13:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 13:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 12:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

Traditional approaches\nshow limitations for such problems. To address these difficulties, we have\ndeveloped a general framework of constructing surrogate models on spaces of\nstochastic input with arbitrary probability measure irrespective of the mutual\ndependencies between individual components and the analytical form. The present\nData-driven Sparsity-enhancing Rotation for Arbitrary Randomness (DSRAR)\nframework includes a data-driven construction of multivariate polynomial basis\nfor arbitrary mutually dependent probability measure and a sparsity enhancement\nrotation procedure. This sparsity-enhancing rotation method was initially\nproposed in our previous work [1] for Gaussian distributions, which may not be\nfeasible for non-Gaussian distributions due to the loss of orthogonality after\nthe rotation. To remedy such difficulties, we developed the new approach to\nconstruct orthonormal polynomials for arbitrary mutually dependent (amdP)\nrandomness, ensuring the constructed basis maintains the orthogonality with\nrespect to the density of the rotated random vector, where directly applying\nthe regular polynomial chaos including arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) [2]\nshows limitations due to the assumption of the mutual independence between the\ncomponents of the random inputs. The developed DSRAR framework leads to\naccurate recovery of a sparse representation of the target functions.

Contrary to the existing multi-task methods which only\nuse a shared CNN feature space to train these two tasks jointly, we fuse the\npredicted attributes with the features from the face modality in order to\nimprove the face identification performance. Experimental results show that our\nmodel brings benefits to both face identification as well as facial attribute\nprediction performance, especially in the case of identity facial attributes\nsuch as gender prediction.
