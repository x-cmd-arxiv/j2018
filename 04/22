We extend this result to periodic\ngraphs under fixed lattice representations. A periodic graph is\nvertex-redundantly rigid if the deletion of a single vertex orbit under the\nperiodicity results in a periodically rigid graph. Our proof is similar to the\none of Tanigawa, but there are some added difficulties. First, it is not known\nwhether periodic global rigidity is a generic property. This issue is resolved\nvia a slight modification of a recent result of Kaszanitzy, Schulze and\nTanigawa (2016). Secondly, while the rigidity of finite graphs in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ on at most $d$ vertices obviously implies their global rigidity,\nit is non-trivial to prove a similar result for periodic graphs.

Computation of competitive equilibria has\nreceived a significant amount of interest in algorithmic game theory, mainly\nfor the prominent case of Fisher markets. Natural and decentralized processes\nlike tatonnement and proportional response dynamics (PRD) converge quickly\ntowards equilibrium in large classes of Fisher markets. Almost all of the\nliterature assumes that the market is a static environment and that the\nparameters of agents and goods do not change over time. In contrast, many large\nreal-world markets are subject to frequent and dynamic changes. In this paper,\nwe provide the first provable performance guarantees of discrete-time\ntatonnement and PRD in markets that are subject to perturbation over time. We\nanalyze the prominent class of Fisher markets with CES utilities and quantify\nthe impact of changes in supplies of goods, budgets of agents, and utility\nfunctions of agents on the convergence of tatonnement to market equilibrium.\nSince the equilibrium becomes a dynamic object and will rarely be reached, our\nanalysis provides bounds expressing the distance to equilibrium that will be\nmaintained via tatonnement and PRD updates. Our results indicate that in many\ncases, tatonnement and PRD follow the equilibrium rather closely and quickly\nrecover conditions of approximate market clearing.

Disease diagnosis\ndue to its sensitive nature, huge costs of error, and complexity has become an\nincreasingly important focus of research in past years. Existing studies model\nEHR by capturing co-occurrence of clinical events to learn their latent\nembeddings. However, relations among clinical events carry various semantics\nand contribute differently to disease diagnosis which gives precedence to a\nmore advanced modeling of heterogeneous data types and relations in EHR data\nthan existing solutions. To address these issues, we represent how\nhigh-dimensional EHR data and its rich relationships can be suitably translated\ninto HeteroMed, a heterogeneous information network for robust medical\ndiagnosis. Our modeling approach allows for straightforward handling of missing\nvalues and heterogeneity of data. HeteroMed exploits metapaths to capture\nhigher level and semantically important relations contributing to disease\ndiagnosis. Furthermore, it employs a joint embedding framework to tailor\nclinical event representations to the disease diagnosis goal. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study to use Heterogeneous Information Network\nfor modeling clinical data and disease diagnosis. Experimental results of our\nstudy show superior performance of HeteroMed compared to prior methods in\nprediction of exact diagnosis codes and general disease cohorts. Moreover,\nHeteroMed outperforms baseline models in capturing similarities of clinical\nevents which are examined qualitatively through case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 00:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

Gradient quantization has been proposed\nas an effective approach to reducing the communication volume. One key issue in\ngradient quantization is setting the number of bits for quantizing the\ngradients. Small number of bits can significantly reduce the communication\noverhead while hurts the gradient accuracies, and vise versa. An ideal\nquantization method would dynamically balance the communication overhead and\nmodel accuracy, through adjusting the number bits according to the knowledge\nlearned from the immediate past training iterations. Existing methods, however,\nquantize the gradients either with fixed number of bits, or with predefined\nheuristic rules. In this paper we propose a novel adaptive quantization method\nwithin the framework of reinforcement learning. The method, referred to as\nMQGrad, formalizes the selection of quantization bits as actions in a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) where the MDP states records the information collected\nfrom the past optimization iterations (e.g., the sequence of the loss function\nvalues). During the training iterations of a machine learning algorithm, MQGrad\ncontinuously updates the MDP state according to the changes of the loss\nfunction. Based on the information, MDP learns to select the optimal actions\n(number of bits) to quantize the gradients. Experimental results based on a\nbenchmark dataset showed that MQGrad can accelerate the learning of a large\nscale deep neural network while keeping its prediction accuracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 04:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

'What is the gravitational\npotential induced by black holes with a cosmological constant (Schwarzschild-de\nSitter (S-dS) metric) on finite thickness global topological defects?'. This is\nthe main question addressed in the present analysis. We also discuss the\nvalidity of Derrick's theorem when scalar fields are embedded in non-trivial\ngravitational backgrounds. In the context of the above question, we consider\nthree global defect configurations: a finite thickness spherical domain wall\nwith a central S-dS black hole, a global string loop with a S-dS black hole in\nthe center and a global monopole near a S-dS black hole. Using an analytical\nmodel and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the\nspherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass\nof the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant. For initial domain wall radius larger than a\ncritical value, the repulsive potential dominates over the wall tension and the\nwall expands towards the cosmological horizon of the S-dS metric where it\ndevelops ghost instabilities. For smaller initial radius, tension dominates and\nthe wall contracts towards the black hole horizon where it also develops ghost\ninstabilities. We also show, using the same analytical model and energetic\narguments that a global monopole is gravitationally attracted by a black hole\nwhile a cosmological constant induces a repulsive gravitational potential as in\nthe case of test particles. Finally we show that a global string loop with\nfinite thickness experiences gravitational repulsion due to the cosmological\nconstant which dominates over its tension for a radius larger than a critical\nradius leading to an expanding rather than contracting loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 11:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

Their atomic\nformulas become instances of sub-atoms, non-commutative self-dual relations\namong logical constants, and their rules are derivable by means of a unique\ndeductive scheme, the medial shape. One of the results is that the\ncut-elimination of subatomic systems implies the cut-elimination of every\nstandard system we can represent sub-atomically.\n  We here introduce Subatomic systems-1.1. They relax and widen the properties\nthat the sub-atoms of Subatomic systems can satisfy while maintaining the use\nof the medial shape as their only inference principle. Since sub-atoms can\noperate directly on variables we introduce P. The cut-elimination of P is a\ncorollary of the cut-elimination that we prove for Subatomic systems-1.1.\nMoreover, P is sound and complete with respect to the clone at the top of\nPost's Lattice. I.e. P proves all and only the tautologies that contain\nconjunctions, disjunctions and projections. So, P extends Propositional logic\nwithout any encoding of its atoms as sub-atoms of P.\n  This shows that the logical principles underpinning Subatomic systems also\napply outside the sub-atomic level which they are conceived to work at. We\nreinforce this point of view by introducing the set R of medial shapes. The\nformulas that the rules in R deal with belong to the union of two disjoint\nclones of Post's Lattice. The SAT-problem of the first clone is in P-Time. The\nSAT-problem of the other is NP-Time complete. So, R and the proof technology of\nSubatomic systems could help to identify proof-theoretical properties that\nhighlight the phase transition from P-Time to NP-Time complete satisfiability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 12:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

In this paper, for all integers\n$q\\geq 3$ and $\\Delta\\geq 3$, we develop algorithms that produce samples within\nerror $o(1)$ from the $q$-state Potts model on random $\\Delta$-regular graphs,\nwhenever the temperature is in uniqueness, for both the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic cases.\n  The algorithm for the antiferromagnetic Potts model is based on iteratively\nadding the edges of the graph and resampling a bichromatic class that contains\nthe endpoints of the newly added edge. Key to the algorithm is how to perform\nthe resampling step efficiently since bichromatic classes may induce\nlinear-sized components. To this end, we exploit the tree uniqueness to show\nthat the average growth of bichromatic components is typically small, which\nallows us to use correlation decay algorithms for the resampling step. While\nthe precise uniqueness threshold on the tree is not known for general values of\n$q$ and $\\Delta$ in the antiferromagnetic case, our algorithm works throughout\nuniqueness regardless of its value.\n  In the case of the ferromagnetic Potts model, we simplify the algorithm\nsignificantly by utilising the random-cluster representation of the model.

It has previously been argued that the only\nside-effect of quantum mining would be an increased difficulty.\n  In this work, we argue that a crucial argument in the analysis of Bitcoin\nsecurity breaks down when quantum mining is performed.\n  Classically, a Bitcoin fork occurs rarely, i.e., when two miners find a block\nalmost simultaneously, due to propagation time effects. The situation differs\ndramatically when quantum miners use Grover's algorithm, which repeatedly\napplies a procedure called a Grover iteration. The chances of finding a block\ngrow quadratically with the number of Grover iterations applied. Crucially, a\nminer does not have to choose how many iterations to apply in advance. Suppose\nAlice receives Bob's new block. To maximize her revenue, she should stop and\nmeasure her state immediately in the hopes that her block (rather than Bob's)\nwill become part of the longest chain. The strong correlation between the\nminers' actions and the fact that they all measure their states at the same\ntime may lead to more forks -- which is known to be a security risk for\nBitcoin. We propose a mechanism that, we conjecture, will prevent this form of\nquantum mining, thereby circumventing the high rate of forks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 14:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 09:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 08:39:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 14:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

Key questions that need to\nbe addressed when planning the deployment of aerial UEs are whether the\ncellular network is a suitable candidate for enabling such connectivity, and\nhow the inclusion of aerial UEs might impact the overall network efficiency.\nThis paper provides an in-depth analysis of user and network level performance\nof a cellular network that serves both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and\nground users in the downlink. Our results show that the favorable propagation\nconditions that UAVs enjoy due to their height often backfire on them, as the\nincreased co-channel interference received from neighboring ground BSs is not\ncompensated by the improved signal strength. When compared with a ground user\nin an urban area, our analysis shows that a UAV flying at 100 meters can\nexperience a throughput decrease of a factor 10 and a coverage drop from 76% to\n30%. Motivated by these findings, we develop UAV and network based solutions to\nenable an adequate integration of UAVs into cellular networks. In particular,\nwe show that an optimal tilting of the UAV antenna can increase their coverage\nand throughput from 23% to 89% and from 3.5 b/s/Hz to 5.8 b/s/Hz, respectively,\noutperforming ground UEs. Furthermore, our findings reveal that depending on\nUAV altitude, the aerial user performance can scale with respect to the network\ndensity better than that of a ground user.

The approximate analytical solutions to the model are\ncompared with the results obtained by numerical fourth order Runge-Kutta\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2018 16:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

One of the\nissues in the standard bat algorithm is the premature convergence that can\noccur due to the low exploration ability of the algorithm under some\nconditions. To overcome this deficiency, directional echolocation is introduced\nto the standard bat algorithm to enhance its exploration and exploitation\ncapabilities. In addition to such directional echolocation, three other\nimprovements have been embedded into the standard bat algorithm to enhance its\nperformance. The new proposed approach, namely the directional Bat Algorithm\n(dBA), has been then tested using several standard and non-standard benchmarks\nfrom the CEC2005 benchmark suite. The performance of dBA has been compared with\nten other algorithms and BA variants using non-parametric statistical tests.\nThe statistical test results show the superiority of the directional bat\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 10:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}
