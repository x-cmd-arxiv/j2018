However, we find a contrary trend that enhancing the\nlinear coupling might not suppress more the nonlinear effect but backfire to\ntrigger some collapse of linear characters. Indeed, in strong SPP couplings a\ntiny strength of TPP may dramatically change properties of the system, like a\nsymmetry spontaneous breaking. By extracting the ground-state phase diagram\nincluding both SPP and TPP, we find TPP in low frequency limit induces a\nquantum phase transition with continuity-discontinuity double faces, which\nsplit into two distinct transitions at finite frequencies and yields a triple\npoint.

In this approach, a deep\n(multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is trained in a supervised manner\nusing backpropagation. Huge amounts of labeled examples are required, but the\nresulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming\nhumans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static,\ncontinuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to\ncompute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike\nrates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically\nrealistic than ANNs, and arguably the only viable option if one wants to\nunderstand how the brain computes. SNNs are also more hardware friendly and\nenergy-efficient than ANNs, and are thus appealing for technology, especially\nfor portable devices. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking\nneurons' transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using\nbackpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to\ntrain deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy, but also computational\ncost and hardware friendliness. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag\nbehind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even\nvanish on some tasks, while the SNNs typically require much fewer operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 18:27:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 02:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2018 14:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 14:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

The rattleback is a toy with some curious properties. When placed\non a surface with reasonable friction, the rattleback has a preferred direction\nof spin. If rotated anti to it, longitudinal vibrations are set up and spin\ndirection is reversed.\n  In this paper, the dynamics of a rattleback placed on a sinusoidally\nvibrating platform are simulated. We can expect base vibrations to excite the\npitch motion of the rattleback, which, because of the coupling between pitch\nand spin motion, should cause the rattleback to spin. Results are presented\nwhich show that this indeed is the case- the rattleback has a mono-peak spin\nresonance with respect to base vibrations. The rattleback, thus, transduces\ntranslating vibrations into continuous rotary motion and, therefore, is ideal\nfor applications in Energy harvesting and Vibration sensing.\n  The dynamic response of the rattleback was found to be composed of two\nprincipal frequencies that appeared in the pitch and rolling motions. One of\nthe frequencies was found to have a large coupling with the spin of the\nrattleback. Spin resonance was found to occur when the base oscillatory\nfrequency was twice the value of the coupled frequency. A linearized model is\ndeveloped which can predict the values of the two frequencies accurately and\nanalytical expressions for the same in terms of the parameters of the\nrattleback have been derived. The analysis, thus, forms an effective and easy\nmethod for obtaining the spin resonant frequency of a given rattleback.\n  Novel ideas for applications utilizing the phenomenon of spin resonance, for\nexample, an energy harvester composed of a magnetized rattleback surrounded by\nferromagnetic walls and a small scale vibration sensor comprising an array of\nseveral magnetized rattlebacks, are included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2018 20:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

For time-of-arrival based\nlocalization, a key factor affecting the positioning error is the relative\npositions of the anchors, with respect to the target location. Specifically,\nthe positioning error is a function of (a) the distance-dependent\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the anchor-target links, and (b) the pairwise\nangles subtended by the anchors at the target location. From a design\nperspective, characterizing the distribution of the positioning error over an\nensemble of target and anchor locations is essential for providing\nprobabilistic performance guarantees against outage. To solve this difficult\nproblem, previous works have assumed all links to have the same SNR (i.e., SNR\nhomogeneity), which neglects the impact of distance variation among the anchors\non the positioning error. In this paper, we model SNR heterogeneity among\nanchors using a distance-dependent pathloss model and derive an accurate\napproximation for the error complementary cumulative distribution function\n(ccdf).

Such users can behave as consumer or producer (hence,\nwe denote them as prosumers) at different time instances. A prosumer may sell\nthe energy to other prosumers in exchange of money. We consider a demand\nresponse model, where the price of conventional energy depends on the total\ndemand of all the prosumers at a certain time. A prosumer depending on its own\nutility has to select the amount of energy it wants to buy either from the grid\nor from other prosumers, or the amount of excess energy it wants to sell to\nother prosumers. However, the strategy, and the payoff of a prosumer inherently\ndepends on the strategy of other prosumers as a prosumer can only buy if the\nother prosumers are willing to sell. We formulate the problem as a coupled\nconstrained game, and seek to obtain the generalized Nash equilibrium.

We consider that a platform will set the price\nfor distributed interchange of energy among the prosumers in order to minimize\nthe consumption of the conventional energy.

An ISO number density estimated from the\ndiscovery of `Oumuamua is so high ($\\sim 0.2$~au$^{-3}$) that Pop.~III\nsurvivors have chances at colliding with ISOs $\\gtrsim 10^5$ times per $1$~Gyr.\n`Oumuamua itself would be sublimated near Pop.~III survivors, since it has\nsmall size, $\\sim 100$~m. However, ISOs with size $\\gtrsim 3$~km would reach\nthe Pop.~III survivor surfaces. Supposing an ISO cumulative number density with\nsize larger than $D$ is $n \\propto D^{-\\alpha}$, Pop.~III survivors can accrete\nISO mass $\\gtrsim 10^{-16}M_\\odot$, or ISO iron mass $\\gtrsim 10^{-17}M_\\odot$,\nif $\\alpha < 4$.

Furthermore, an implicit interpolation is applied to\nconvert the multi-resolution feature maps to the continuous domain and make all\nprimal confidence score maps have the same spatial resolution.

The marginal distributions are nonparametric, with means given by the\nregression means. The model has the advantage of preserving the heavy\nright-hand tail in the predictive densities of price. We fit the model to\nhalf-hourly spot price data in the five interconnected regions of the\nAustralian national electricity market. The fitted model is then used to\nmeasure how both supply and price shocks in one region are transmitted to the\ndistribution of prices in all regions in subsequent periods. Finally, to\nvalidate our econometric model, we show that prices forecast using the proposed\nmodel compare favorably with those from some benchmark alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 01:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

Photon calibrators have so far been the primary tools for absolute\ncalibration of test-mass displacement, relying on measurement of the photon\npressure. The current technological limit of the absolute calibration\nuncertainty for gravitational-wave amplitudes is limited to a few percent, due\nto the uncertainty in the laser power-standard maintained by the metrology\ninstitutes. To reduce this uncertainty, this article proposes a novel\ncalibration method that combines a photon calibrator and a gravity field\ncalibrator.

In previous\nstudies, uncertainty in the distance between the test mass and the gravity\nfield calibrator has proven a serious source of systematic error. To suppress\nthis uncertainty, we propose a novel method that uses a combination of\nquadrupole and hexapole mass distributions in the gravity field calibrator.

The results are analyzed using a generalized\ntunneling formula for the current, which is reminiscent of the Meir-Wingreen\nformula and provides insights into the relevant physical processes. In the DC\ncase, the spectrum of the NESSs exhibits Wannier-Stark (WS) states associated\nwith the lower and upper Hubbard bands. In addition, there emerge WS sidebands\nfrom many-body states. Using the tunneling formula, we demonstrate that the\ntunneling between these WS states leads to peaks or humps in the induced DC\ncurrent.

In the crossover regime, the\nsingle-particle spectrum is characterized by a coexistence of Floquet sidebands\nand WS peaks, and the current and double occupation exhibits a nontrivial\ndependence on the field strength. The tunneling formula works quantitatively\nwell even in the AC case, and we use it to discuss the potential cooperation of\ntunneling and multi-photon processes in the crossover regime.

While automatic\ncontent generation has played a fundamental challenge to multimedia community\nfor decades, recent advances of deep learning have made this problem feasible.\nFor example, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a rewarding approach\nto synthesize images. Nevertheless, it is not trivial when capitalizing on GANs\nto generate videos. The difficulty originates from the intrinsic structure\nwhere a video is a sequence of visually coherent and semantically dependent\nframes. This motivates us to explore semantic and temporal coherence in\ndesigning GANs to generate videos. In this paper, we present a novel Temporal\nGANs conditioning on Captions, namely TGANs-C, in which the input to the\ngenerator network is a concatenation of a latent noise vector and caption\nembedding, and then is transformed into a frame sequence with 3D\nspatio-temporal convolutions. Unlike the naive discriminator which only judges\npairs as fake or real, our discriminator additionally notes whether the video\nmatches the correct caption. In particular, the discriminator network consists\nof three discriminators: video discriminator classifying realistic videos from\ngenerated ones and optimizes video-caption matching, frame discriminator\ndiscriminating between real and fake frames and aligning frames with the\nconditioning caption, and motion discriminator emphasizing the philosophy that\nthe adjacent frames in the generated videos should be smoothly connected as in\nreal ones. We qualitatively demonstrate the capability of our TGANs-C to\ngenerate plausible videos conditioning on the given captions on two synthetic\ndatasets (SBMG and TBMG) and one real-world dataset (MSVD). Moreover,\nquantitative experiments on MSVD are performed to validate our proposal via\nGenerative Adversarial Metric and human study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 07:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

To combine these two worlds, we integrate a new design, namely\ndescriptiveness regression, into a single shot detection structure to infer the\ndescriptive complexity of each detected proposal via sentence generation. This\nin turn adjusts the temporal locations of each event proposal. Our model\ndiffers from existing dense video captioning methods since we propose a joint\nand global optimization of detection and captioning, and the framework uniquely\ncapitalizes on an attribute-augmented video captioning architecture. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on ActivityNet Captions dataset and our framework\nshows clear improvements when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. More\nremarkably, we obtain a new record: METEOR of 12.96% on ActivityNet Captions\nofficial test set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 08:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

Recent research has shown that leveraging\nsupervised information can lead to high quality hashing. However, the cost of\nannotating data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing to a new\ndomain. Moreover, the results can suffer from the robustness problem as the\ndata at training and test stage could come from similar but different\ndistributions. This paper studies the exploration of generating synthetic data\nthrough semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), which leverages\nlargely unlabeled and limited labeled training data to produce highly\ncompelling data with intrinsic invariance and global coherence, for better\nunderstanding statistical structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the\nabove two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for\nhashing. Specifically, a novel deep semantic hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is\npresented, which mainly consists of four components: a deep convolution neural\nnetworks (CNN) for learning image representations, an adversary stream to\ndistinguish synthetic images from real ones, a hash stream for encoding image\nrepresentations to hash codes and a classification stream. The whole\narchitecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing three losses, i.e.,\nadversarial loss to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample, triplet\nranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input\nreal-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify each sample\naccurately. Extensive experiments conducted on both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image\nbenchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing.\nOur framework also achieves superior results when compared to state-of-the-art\ndeep hash models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 08:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

In a number of recent studies, it is been\nshown that exposure to this form of pollution eventually outweighs the\ncardio-vascular benefits associated with cycling. Hence during cycling there\nare conflicting effects that affect the cyclist. On the one hand, cycling\neffort gives rise to health benefits, whereas exposure to pollution clearly\ndoes not. Mathematically speaking, these conflicting effects give rise to\nconvex utility functions that describe the health threats accrued to cyclists.\nMore particularly, and roughly speaking, for a given level of background\npollution, there is an optimal length of journey time that minimises the health\nrisks to a cyclist. In this paper, we consider a group of cyclists that share a\ncommon route. This may be recreational cyclists, or cyclists that travel\ntogether from an origin to destination. Given this context, we ask the\nfollowing question. What is the common speed at which the cyclists should\ntravel, so that the overall health risks can be minimised? We formulate this as\nan optimisation problem with consensus constraints.

To do this, we extend a recently\nderived consensus result to the case of quasi-convex utility functions.\nSimulation studies in different scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of our\nproposed system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 08:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

It is\nparticularly important today since cloud services become increasingly common\nmaking it necessary to protect users' private information from database access\npattern analyses. Previous ORAM studies focused mostly on reducing the access\noverhead.

Furthermore, for the real\ntime applications, active distribution networks require fast real time\ndistribution state estimation (DSE). Forecasting aided state estimator (FASE),\ndeploys measured data in consecutive time samples to refine the state estimate.\nAlthough most of the DSE algorithms deal with real and imaginary parts of\ndistribution networks states independently, we propose a non iterative complex\nDSE algorithm based on augmented complex Kalman filter (ACKF) which considers\nthe states as complex values. In case of real time DSE and in presence of a\nlarge number of customer loads in the system, employing DSEs in one single\nestimation layer is not computationally efficient.

Previous measurements reported on negligible convective flows in umbral\ncores. Based on this, numerous studies have taken the umbra as zero reference\nto calculate Doppler velocities of the ambient active region. To clarify the\namount of convective motion in the darkest part of umbrae, we directly measured\nDoppler velocities with an unprecedented accuracy and precision. We performed\nspectroscopic observations of sunspot umbrae with the Laser Absolute Reference\nSpectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. A laser frequency\ncomb enabled the calibration of the high-resolution spectrograph and absolute\nwavelength positions. A thorough spectral calibration, including the\nmeasurement of the reference wavelength, yielded Doppler shifts of the spectral\nline Ti i 5713.9 {\\AA} with an uncertainty of around 5 m s-1. The measured\nDoppler shifts are a composition of umbral convection and magneto-acoustic\nwaves. For the analysis of convective shifts, we temporally average each\nsequence to reduce the superimposed wave signal. Compared to convective\nblueshifts of up to -350 m s-1 in the quiet Sun, sunspot umbrae yield a\nstrongly reduced convective blueshifts around -30 m s-1. {W}e find that the\nvelocity in a sunspot umbra correlates significantly with the magnetic field\nstrength, but also with the umbral temperature defining the depth of the\ntitanium line. The vertical upward motion decreases with increasing field\nstrength. Extrapolating the linear approximation to zero magnetic field\nreproduces the measured quiet Sun blueshift. Simply taking the sunspot umbra as\na zero velocity reference for the calculation of photospheric Dopplergrams can\nimply a systematic velocity error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 09:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Stellar photometry, therefore,\nprovides an economical method to obtain intrinsic stellar parameters. With the\naddition of distance information - deriving reliable ages from photometry is a\npossibility. We have developed a Bayesian method that generates 2D probability\nmaps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using\nisochrones. Our synthetic tests show that including a near-UV passband enables\nus to break the degeneracy between a star's age and metallicity for certain\nevolutionary stages. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and\nmetallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band\nand a parallax with uncertainty less than ~20%. Metallicities alone are\npossible for the main sequence and giant branch. We find good agreement with\nthe literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark stars,\nparticularly for turn-off and young stars. Further tests on the old open\ncluster NGC 188, however, reveal significant limitations in the stellar\nisochrones. The ages derived for the cluster stars vary with evolutionary\nstage, such that turn-off ages disagree with those on the sub-giant branch, and\nmetallicities vary significantly throughout. Furthermore, the parameters vary\nappreciably depending on which colour combinations are used in the derivation.\nWe identify the causes of these mismatches and show that improvements are\nneeded in the modelling of giant branch stars and in the creation and\ncalibration of synthetic near-UV photometry. Our results warn against applying\nisochrone fitting indiscriminately. In particular, the uncertainty on the\nstellar models should be quantitatively taken into account. Further efforts to\nimprove the models will result in significant advancements in our ability to\nstudy the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 10:22:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 19:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Moreover, we compute the sterile neutrino spectra of the nuclear\nproton-proton nuclear reactions -- $pp$, $hep$ and $^8B$ and the\ncarbon-nitrogen-oxygen -- $^{13}N$, $^{15}O$ and $^{17}F$ and the spectral\nlines of $^7Be$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 11:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

Firstly, the source images are divided into several\npatches by sliding window technique. Then, the patches are classified according\nto the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features.

In this work, we propose the VLocNet++ architecture\nthat employs a multitask learning approach to exploit the inter-task\nrelationship between learning semantics, regressing 6-DoF global pose and\nodometry, for the mutual benefit of each of these tasks. Our network overcomes\nthe aforementioned limitation by simultaneously embedding geometric and\nsemantic knowledge of the world into the pose regression network.

From a computational standpoint, this necessitates fine\nmeshes, at least locally, in order to accurately resolve the phase-field\nprofile. In the classical approach, phase-field models are computed on a fixed\nmesh that is a priori refined in the areas where the crack is expected to\npropagate. This on the other hand curbs the convenience of using phase-field\nmodels for unknown crack paths and its ability to handle complex crack\npropagation patterns. In this work, we overcome this issue by employing the\nmulti-level hp-refinement technique that enables a dynamically changing mesh\nwhich in turn allows the refinement to remain local at singularities and high\ngradients without problems of hanging nodes. Yet, in case of complex\ngeometries, mesh generation and in particular local refinement becomes\nnon-trivial. We address this issue by integrating a two-dimensional phase-field\nframework for brittle fracture with the finite cell method (FCM). The FCM based\non high-order finite elements is a non-geometry-conforming discretization\ntechnique wherein the physical domain is embedded into a larger fictitious\ndomain of simple geometry that can be easily discretized. This facilitates mesh\ngeneration for complex geometries and supports local refinement. Numerical\nexamples including a comparison to a validation experiment illustrate the\napplicability of the multi-level hp-refinement and the FCM in the context of\nphase-field simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 12:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Using the\nAustralian Long Baseline Array we have conducted very long baseline\ninterferometric observations of PSR B1259-63 over 4.4 years, fully sampling the\n3.4-year orbital period. From our measured parallax of $0.38\\pm0.05$ mas we use\na Bayesian approach to infer a distance of $2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ kpc. We find\nthat the binary orbit is viewed at an angle of $154\\pm3$ degrees to the line of\nsight, implying that the pulsar moves clockwise around its orbit as viewed on\nthe sky. Taking our findings together with previous results from pulsar timing\nobservations, all seven orbital elements for the system are now fully\ndetermined.

But this task is challenging due to the weak boundaries of organs, the\ncomplexity of the background, and the variable sizes of different organs. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for multi-organ\nsegmentation by using organ-attention networks with reverse connections\n(OAN-RCs) which are applied to 2D views, of the 3D CT volume, and output\nestimates which are combined by statistical fusion exploiting structural\nsimilarity. OAN is a two-stage deep convolutional network, where deep network\nfeatures from the first stage are combined with the original image, in a second\nstage, to reduce the complex background and enhance the discriminative\ninformation for the target organs. RCs are added to the first stage to give the\nlower layers semantic information thereby enabling them to adapt to the sizes\nof different organs. Our networks are trained on 2D views enabling us to use\nholistic information and allowing efficient computation. To compensate for the\nlimited cross-sectional information of the original 3D volumetric CT,\nmulti-sectional images are reconstructed from the three different 2D view\ndirections. Then we combine the segmentation results from the different views\nusing statistical fusion, with a novel term relating the structural similarity\nof the 2D views to the original 3D structure. To train the network and evaluate\nresults, 13 structures were manually annotated by four human raters and\nconfirmed by a senior expert on 236 normal cases. We tested our algorithm and\ncomputed Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficients and surface distances for\nevaluating our estimates of the 13 structures.

Equal error rate (EER) of the CM, a confusability index of VC\nsamples with real human speech, serves as our artifact measure. Two clusters of\nVCC'18 entries are identified: low-quality ones with detectable artifacts (low\nEERs), and higher quality ones with less artifacts. None of the VCC'18 systems,\nhowever, is perfect: all EERs are < 30 % (the `ideal' value would be 50 %). Our\npreliminary findings suggest potential of CMs outside of their original\napplication, as a supplemental optimization and benchmarking tool to enhance VC\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 13:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 17:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

The dark\nenergy has a constant equation of state and the interaction model produces\nstable perturbations. The resulting picture is constrained using different\nastronomical data aiming to measure the impact of the anisotropic stress on the\ncosmological parameters. Our analyses show that a non-zero interaction in the\ndark sector is allowed while a non-interaction scenario is recovered within\n68\\% CL. The anisotropic stress is also constrained to be small, and its zero\nvalue is permitted within 68\\% CL. The dark energy equation of state, $w_x$, is\nalso found to be close to `$-1$' boundary. However, from the ratio of the CMB\nTT spectra, we see that the model has a mild deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology while such deviation is almost forbidden from the CMB TT spectra\nalone. Although the deviation is not much significant, but from the present\ndata, we cannot exclude such deviation.

In this paper, we take one step further to investigate generation of\npoetic language (with multiple lines) to an image for automatic poetry\ncreation. This task involves multiple challenges, including discovering poetic\nclues from the image (e.g., hope from green), and generating poems to satisfy\nboth relevance to the image and poeticness in language level. To solve the\nabove challenges, we formulate the task of poem generation into two correlated\nsub-tasks by multi-adversarial training via policy gradient, through which the\ncross-modal relevance and poetic language style can be ensured. To extract\npoetic clues from images, we propose to learn a deep coupled visual-poetic\nembedding, in which the poetic representation from objects, sentiments and\nscenes in an image can be jointly learned. Two discriminative networks are\nfurther introduced to guide the poem generation, including a multi-modal\ndiscriminator and a poem-style discriminator. To facilitate the research, we\nhave released two poem datasets by human annotators with two distinct\nproperties: 1) the first human annotated image-to-poem pair dataset (with 8,292\npairs in total), and 2) to-date the largest public English poem corpus dataset\n(with 92,265 different poems in total).

These are the classic signatures of a quantum critical\npoint, as observed in heavy-fermion and iron-based superconductors where their\nantiferromagnetic phase ends. We conclude that the pseudogap phase of cuprates\nends at a quantum critical point, whose associated fluctuations are most likely\ninvolved in the $d$-wave pairing and the anomalous scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 15:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}
