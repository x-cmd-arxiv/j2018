This idea of Channel Boosting exploits both\nthe channel dimension of CNN (learning from multiple input channels) and\nTransfer learning (TL). TL is utilized at two different stages; channel\ngeneration and channel exploitation. In the proposed methodology, a deep CNN is\nboosted by various channels available through TL from already trained Deep\nNeural Networks, in addition to its original channel. The deep architecture of\nCNN then exploits the original and boosted channels down the stream for\nlearning discriminative patterns. Churn prediction in telecom is a challenging\ntask due to the high dimensionality and imbalanced nature of the data.\nTherefore, churn prediction data is used to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed Channel Boosted CNN (CB CNN). In the first phase, informative\ndiscriminative features are being extracted using a stacked autoencoder, and\nthen in the second phase, these features are combined with the original\nfeatures to form Channel Boosted images. Finally, the knowledge gained by a\npretrained CNN is exploited by employing TL. The results are promising and show\nthe ability of the Channel Boosting concept in learning complex classification\nproblems by discerning even minute differences in churners and nonchurners.

Under suitable smoothness\nassumptions that guarantee uniqueness of the MFG equilibrium, a form of law of\nlarge of numbers (LLN), also known as propagation of chaos, has been\nestablished to show that the MFG equilibrium arises as the limit of the\nsequence of empirical measures of the $n$-player game Nash equilibria,\nincluding the case when player dynamics are driven by both idiosyncratic and\ncommon sources of noise. The proof of convergence relies on the so-called\nmaster equation for the value function of the MFG, a partial differential\nequation on the space of probability measures.

Achieving\ncompression requires encoding such grammar as a binary string; there are a few\ncommonly used encodings. We bound the size of practically used encodings for\nseveral heuristical compression methods, including \\RePair and \\Greedy\nalgorithms: the standard encoding of \\RePair, which combines entropy coding and\nspecial encoding of a grammar, achieves $1.5|S|H_k(S)$, where $H_k(S)$ is\n$k$-th order entropy of $S$. We also show that by stopping after some iteration\nwe can achieve $|S|H_k(S)$. This is particularly interesting, as it explains a\nphenomenon observed in practice: introducing too many nonterminals causes the\nbit-size to grow.

Storing keys in a centralized location, like an\nInternet-accessible server, raises serious security concerns (e.g. server\ncompromise). Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a\nwell-known solution for protecting sensitive data in untrusted environments,\nand are now becoming available on commodity server platforms.\n  Although the idea of protecting keys using a server-side TEE is\nstraight-forward, in this paper we validate this approach and show that it\nenables new desirable functionality.

Due to the ejection\nlocation, such a HVS initially has negligible azimuthal angular momentum Lz ~ 0\nkpc km/s. Even if the halo is mildly triaxial, Lz of a recently ejected nearby\nHVS remains negligible, since its flight time from the Galactic Center is too\nshort to accumulate noticeable torque. However, if we make a wrong assumption\nabout the Solar position and velocity, such a HVS would apparently have\nnoticeable non-zero azimuthal angular momentum, due to the wrong reflex motion\nof the Sun.

Data generated from the\ndictionary A (an n by m matrix, with m > n in the over-complete setting) is\ngiven by Y = AX where X is a matrix whose columns have supports chosen from a\ndistribution over k-sparse vectors, and the non-zero values chosen from a\nsymmetric distribution. Given Y, the goal is to recover A and X in polynomial\ntime. Existing algorithms give polytime guarantees for recovering incoherent\ndictionaries, under strong distributional assumptions both on the supports of\nthe columns of X, and on the values of the non-zero entries. In this work, we\nstudy the following question: Can we design efficient algorithms for recovering\ndictionaries when the supports of the columns of X are arbitrary?\n  To address this question while circumventing the issue of\nnon-identifiability, we study a natural semirandom model for dictionary\nlearning where there are a large number of samples $y=Ax$ with arbitrary\nk-sparse supports for x, along with a few samples where the sparse supports are\nchosen uniformly at random. While the few samples with random supports ensures\nidentifiability, the support distribution can look almost arbitrary in\naggregate. Hence existing algorithmic techniques seem to break down as they\nmake strong assumptions on the supports.\n  Our main contribution is a new polynomial time algorithm for learning\nincoherent over-complete dictionaries that works under the semirandom model.\nAdditionally the same algorithm provides polynomial time guarantees in new\nparameter regimes when the supports are fully random. Finally using these\ntechniques, we also identify a minimal set of conditions on the supports under\nwhich the dictionary can be (information theoretically) recovered from\npolynomial samples for almost linear sparsity, i.e., $k=\\tilde{O}(n)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 17:57:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 15:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The Future Circular Collider (FCC) study at\nCERN is considering a 100 TeV collider to be installed in a 100 km tunnel in\nthe Lake Geneva basin. Another 100 km collider being considered in China is the\nSuper proton-proton Collider (SppC).

In\nthis work we investigate the potential of HE-LHC for the discovery of\nsupersymmetry.

For comparison, we study model points at HE-LHC which\nare also discoverable at HL-LHC.

This black box might be any number of simple or complicated\nthings: a linear or non-linear filter, some app on your phone, etc. The latter\nis a good canonical example for the problem we address: Given only \"the app\"\nand an image produced by the app, find the image that was fed to the app. You\ncan run the given image (or any other image) through the app as many times as\nyou like, but you can not look inside the (code for the) app to see how it\nworks. At first blush, the problem sounds a lot like a standard inverse\nproblem, but it is not in the following sense: While we have access to the\nblack box $f(\\cdot)$ and can run any image through it and observe the output,\nwe do not know how the block box alters the image. Therefore we have no\nexplicit form or model of $f(\\cdot)$. Nor are we necessarily interested in the\ninternal workings of the black box. We are simply happy to reverse its effect\non a particular image, to whatever extent possible. This is what we call the\n\"rendition\" (rather than restoration) problem, as it does not fit the mold of\nan inverse problem (blind or otherwise). We describe general conditions under\nwhich rendition is possible, and provide a remarkably simple algorithm that\nworks for both contractive and expansive black box operators.

If the latter model is assumed, GRB X-ray afterglow light curves\ncan be analytically reproduced. We fit a sample of GRB X-ray plateaus,\ninterestingly yielding a distribution in the magnetic field versus spin period\n(B-P) diagram consistent with $B\\propto P^{7/6}$. This is expected from the\nwell-established physics of the spin-up line minimum period for Galactic\nmillisecond pulsars. The normalisation of the relation we obtain perfectly\nmatches spin-up line predictions for the expected masses ($\\sim 1 M_{\\odot}$)\nand radii ($\\sim 10 {\\rm ~km}$) of newly born magnetars, and mass accretion\nrates consistent with GRB expectations of $10^{-4} M_{\\odot}/{\\rm s} <\\dot{M}<\n10^{-1} M_{\\odot}/{\\rm s}$. Short GRBs with extended emission (SEE) appear\ntowards the high period end of the distribution, while the long GRBs (LGRBs)\ntowards the short period end. This result is consistent with spin-up limit\nexpectations where the total accreted mass determines the position of the\nneutron star in the B-P diagram. The P-B distribution for LGRBs and SEE are\nstatistically different, further supporting the idea that the fundamental plane\nrelation \\citep{dainotti16c,Dainotti2017} is a powerful discriminant among\nthose populations. Our conclusions are robust against suppositions regarding\nthe GRB collimation angle and magnetar breaking index, which shifts the\nresulting magnetar properties parallel to the spin-up line, and strongly\nsupport a magnetar origin for GRBs presenting X-ray plateaus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 18:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 10:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Specifically,\nin the quantum chaotic system, a simple operator can become increasingly\ncomplicated under unitary time evolution. This can be diagnosed by various\nmeasures such as square of the commutator (out-of-time-ordered correlator),\noperator entanglement entropy etc. In this paper, we discuss operator\nscrambling in three representative models: a chaotic spin-$1/2$ chain with\nspatially local interactions, a 2-local spin model and the quantum linear map.\nIn the first two examples, although the speeds of scrambling are quite\ndifferent, a simple Pauli spin operator can eventually approach a \"highly\nentangled\" operator with operator entanglement entropy taking a volume law\nvalue (close to the Page value). Meanwhile, the spectrum of the operator\nreduced density matrix develops a universal spectral correlation which can be\ncharacterized by the Wishart random matrix ensemble. In the second example, we\nfurther connect the 2-local model into a one dimensional chain and briefly\ndiscuss the operator scrambling there. In contrast, in the quantum linear map,\nalthough the square of commutator can increase exponentially with time, a\nsimple operator does not scramble but performs chaotic motion in the operator\nbasis space determined by the classical linear map. We show that once we modify\nthe quantum linear map such that operator can mix in the operator basis, the\noperator entanglement entropy can grow and eventually saturate to its Page\nvalue, thus making it a truly quantum chaotic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 18:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

The existing\nwork in this domain has focused on simulation settings of small areas with\ntoroidal shapes.

In our work, we study new\nenvironments with lower agent density, wherein interactions are more rare. We\nstudy the efficacy of placement strategies and influencing agent behaviors\ndrawn from the literature, and find that the behaviors that have been shown to\nwork well in high-density conditions tend to be much less effective in lower\ndensity environments. The source of this ineffectiveness is that the\ninfluencing agents explored in prior work tended to face directions optimized\nfor maximal influence, but which actually separate the influencing agents from\nthe flock. We find that in low-density conditions maintaining a connection to\nthe flock is more important than rushing to orient towards the desired\ndirection. We use these insights to propose new influencing agent behaviors,\nwhich we dub \"follow-then-influence\"; agents act like normal members of the\nflock to achieve positions that allow for control and then exert their\ninfluence. This strategy overcomes the difficulties posed by low density\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 18:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

In contrast to the existing works, we\nfound that integrating the path gradient into the control framework improves\nthe speed tracking efficacy. Since the control law is implemented over a\nshrinking domain scheme, it minimizes the integrated error by recomputing the\ncontrol inputs at every discretized step and consequently provides less\nreaction time. This makes our control law suitable for motion planning\nframeworks that are operating at high frequencies.

We focus on the\nsemi-leptonic final states, and make projections of the reach for future runs\nof the LHC with integrated luminosities of 300 fb$^{-1}$ and 3 ab$^{-1}$.

With possession of the private key, an attacker\nvirtually owns all of the currency in the compromised wallet. Managing\ncryptocurrency wallets offline, in isolated ('air-gapped') computers, has been\nsuggested in order to secure the private keys from theft. Such air-gapped\nwallets are often referred to as 'cold wallets.' In this paper, we show how\nprivate keys can be exfiltrated from air-gapped wallets. In the adversarial\nattack model, the attacker infiltrates the offline wallet, infecting it with\nmalicious code.

Probabilistic predictions that incorporate this uncertainty can then\nbe made to evaluate system performance and make decisions. While Bayesian\nmethods are very useful, they are often computationally intensive. This\nnecessitates the development of more efficient algorithms. Here, we discuss a\ngroup of population Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian\nupdating and system reliability assessment that we call Sequential Tempered\nMCMC (ST-MCMC) algorithms.

However,\nstandard algorithms currently adopted by the plasma physics community do not\npossess the long-term accuracy and fidelity required in these large-scale\nsimulations.

The traditional\nway to quantify the degradation of ballast is to use an index called Fouling\nIndex (FI) through ballast sampling and sieve analysis. However, determining\nthe FI values in lab is very time-consuming and laborious, but with the help of\nrecent development in the field of computer vision, a novel method for a\npotential machine-vison based ballast inspection system can be employed that\ncan hopefully replace the traditional mechanical method. The new machine-vision\napproach analyses the images of the in-service ballasts, and then utilizes\nimage segmentation algorithm to get ballast segments. By comparing the segment\nresults and their corresponding FI values, this novel method produces a\nmachine-vision-based index that has the best-fit relation with FI. The\nimplementation details of how this algorithm works are discussed in this\nreport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 04:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

One may intuitively use the number of parameters\nrequired as a rough gauge of the difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are\nsuch notions? How many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt\nto answer this question by training networks not in their native parameter\nspace, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented subspace. We slowly increase\nthe dimension of this subspace, note at which dimension solutions first appear,\nand define this to be the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The\napproach is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces\nseveral suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions\nthan one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given dataset varies\nlittle across a family of models with vastly different sizes. This latter\nresult has the profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough\nto solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase the\ndimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension allows some\nquantitative comparison of problem difficulty across supervised, reinforcement,\nand other types of learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the\ninverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from\nMNIST, and playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying\nCIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes\nwandered by parameterized models, the method is a simple technique for\nconstructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a\nsolution. A byproduct of this construction is a simple approach for compressing\nnetworks, in some cases by more than 100 times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 04:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

The $^{35}$Mg\nnucleus has a smaller radius than the neighboring even-$N$ nuclei, which is\nattributed to its smaller deformation. In contrast, a neutron halo is obtained\nin $^{37}$Mg. We point out that, in contrast to the pairing anti-halo effect\nthat may operate on the even-$N$ nuclei, the pair correlation enhances halos in\nodd-$N$ nuclei, owing to the new mechanism which we call\n\\textit{unpaired-particle haloing}. The halo in $^{37}$Mg is predicted to have\npeanut shape in its intrinsic state, reflecting $p$-wave contribution, as in\n$^{40}$Mg. The $N$-dependence of the deformation is significant again, by which\nthe single-particle level dominated by the $p$-wave component comes down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 06:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 00:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 00:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

A number of theories have been proposed, yet\ncritical tests are missing and the validity of these theories is unclear. In\nparticular, the precise location of the crossover frequency remains\ncontroversial, and more critically, even the validity of the Rayleigh\nscattering itself has been seriously questioned. The present work settles these\nissues by using information on the underlying vibrational eigenmodes.\nVibrational eigenmodes were recently clarified over a wide frequency regime: a\nmixture of phonon modes and soft localized modes in the continuum limit and\ndisordered and extended modes in the boson peak regime. Here, we demonstrate\nthat Rayleigh scattering occurs in the continuum limit and viscous damping\noccurs in the boson peak regime, and these behaviors are therefore linked to\nthe underlying eigenmodes in the corresponding frequency regimes. Our results\nunambiguously determine the crossover frequency. Furthermore, we establish\ncharacteristic scaling laws of phonon transport, which are consistent with the\nprediction of the mean-field theory at higher frequencies but inconsistent in\nthe low-frequency, Rayleigh scattering regime. Our results therefore reveal\ncrucial issues to be solved with regard to the current theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 06:21:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 03:43:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 04:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-24"}

If most of\nX-ray photons have traveled from the primary source to the observer with\nminimum light-matter interaction, a fraction of radiation is emitted at\ndifferent directions and is reprocessed by the parsec-scale equatorial\ncircumnuclear region or the polar outflows. It is still unclear how much the\npolarization expected from type-1 AGN is affected by radiation that have\nscattered on the distant AGN components. In this paper, we examine the\ncontribution of remote material onto the polarized X-ray spectrum of type-1\nSeyfert galaxies using radiative transfer Monte Carlo codes. We find that the\nobserved X-ray polarization strongly depends on the initial polarization\nemerging from the disk-corona system. For unpolarized and parallelly polarized\nphotons (parallel to the disk), the contribution is negligible below 3 keV and\ntends to increase the polarization degree by up to one percentage points at\nhigher energies, smoothing out the energy-dependent variations of the\npolarization angle. For perpendicularly polarized corona photons, the addition\nof the circumnuclear scattered (parallel) component adds to the polarization\nabove 10 keV, decreases polarization below 10 keV and shifts the expected 90\ndeg rotation of the polarization angle to lower energies.

The present\nwork deals with the determination of the longitudinal Young's modulus of single\nnon-lignified plant roots, chick-peas (Cicer arietinum L.), tested in\ncompression along their root axis for different external environments: in\ncontrolled conditions of natural drying in air or in a osmotic solution of\nmannitol at the isotonic concentration where no water exchange occurs between\nthe root and the external solution.

Self-assembly is frequently used to create monolayers that redefine\nthe surface chemistry in just a single-molecule-thick layer. Indeed, STM images\nreveal rich information about the structure of self-assembled monolayers since\nthey convey chemical and physical properties of the studied material.\n  In order to assist in and to enhance the analysis of STM and other images, we\npropose and demonstrate an image-processing framework that produces two image\nsegmentations: one is based on intensities (apparent heights in STM images) and\nthe other is based on textural patterns. The proposed framework begins with a\ncartoon+texture decomposition, which separates an image into its cartoon and\ntexture components. Afterward, the cartoon image is segmented by a modified\nmultiphase version of the local Chan-Vese model, while the texture image is\nsegmented by a combination of 2D empirical wavelet transform and a clustering\nalgorithm. Overall, our proposed framework contains several new features,\nspecifically in presenting a new application of cartoon+texture decomposition\nand of the empirical wavelet transforms and in developing a specialized\nframework to segment STM images and other data.

A supercell\nof drilled holes in an acoustically rigid surface is proposed as the basic unit\ncell, and analytical expressions for an inverse diffraction problem are\nderived. It is found that the the number of holes required for the realization\nof an anomalous reflector is equal to the number of diffracted modes to cancel,\nand this number depends on the relationship between the incident and reflected\nangles. Then, the \"retrorreflection\" effect is obtained by just one hole per\nunit cell, also with only two holes it is possible to change the reflection\nangle of a normally incident wave and five holes are enough to design a general\nretroreflector changing the incident and reflected angles at oblique incidence.\nFinally, the concept of Snell's law violation is extended not only to the\nincident and reflected angles, but also to the plane in which it happens, and a\ndevice based on a single hole in a square lattice is designed in such a way\nthat the reflection plane is rotated $\\pi/4$ with respect to the plane of\nincidence.

We\npropose a simple and easy-to-implement modification to the integration scheme\nof the Langevin algorithm that addresses the fundamental source of the\noverdamped behaviour of high-friction Langevin dynamics: if the action of the\nthermostat causes the momentum of a particle to change direction, it is flipped\nback.

Whenever the runtime behaviour of the monitored\nsystem is about to deviate from the specification (either due to a programming\nbug or a security hijack attack), the monitors apply enforcement techniques to\nprevent this deviation.\n  Current Runtime Enforcement techniques require that the correctness\nspecification defines the behaviour of the enforcement monitor itself. This\nburdens the specifier with not only having to define property that needs to be\nenforced, but also with having to specify how this should be enforced at\nruntime; we thus relieve the specifier from this burden by resorting to a\nhighly expressive logic. Using a logic we allow the specifier to define the\ncorrectness specification as a logic formula from which we can automatically\nsynthesise the appropriate enforcement monitor.\n  Highly expressive logics can, however, permit for defining a wide variety of\nformulae, some of which cannot actually be enforced correctly at runtime. We\nthus study the enforceability of Hennessy Milner Logic with Recursion for which\nwe identify a subset that allows for defining enforceable formulae. This allows\nus to define a synthesis function that translates enforceable formulae into\nenforcement monitors. As our monitors are meant to ensure the correct behaviour\nof the monitored system, it is imperative that they work correctly themselves.\nWe thus study formal definitions that allow us to ensure that our enforcement\nmonitors behave correctly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 09:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 17:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

To date, simulation softwares have been\ndeveloped by individual researchers or research groups in each field, with a\nhuge amount of time and effort, even though numerical algorithms used are very\nsimilar. To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have\nprovided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran. In order to support arbitrary\ndata types of particle in Fortran, we design the Fortran interface layer as\nfollows. Based on a given derived data type in Fortran representing particle, a\nPython script provided by us automatically generates a library that manipulates\nthe C++ core part of FDPS. This library is seen as a Fortran module providing\nAPI of FDPS from the Fortran side and uses C programs internally to\ninteroperate Fortran with C++. In this way, we have overcome several technical\nissues when emulating `template' in Fortran. By using the Fortran interface,\nusers can develop all parts of their codes in Fortran.

However,\nexisting attempts usually focus on the former one while pay less attention to\nreliability learning. This may make the learned filter be dominated by the\nunexpected salient regions on the feature map, thereby resulting in model\ndegradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel CF-based optimization\nproblem to jointly model the discrimination and reliability information. First,\nwe treat the filter as the element-wise product of a base filter and a\nreliability term. The base filter is aimed to learn the discrimination\ninformation between the target and backgrounds, and the reliability term\nencourages the final filter to focus on more reliable regions. Second, we\nintroduce a local response consistency regular term to emphasize equal\ncontributions of different regions and avoid the tracker being dominated by\nunreliable regions. The proposed optimization problem can be solved using the\nalternating direction method and speeded up in the Fourier domain.

Our main result is that the following\nstatements are equivalent.\n  - The polyhedron $P$ is principally box-integer.\n  - The polyhedron $P$ is box-TDI.\n  - Every face-defining matrix of $P$ is equimodular.\n  - Every face of $P$ has an equimodular face-defining matrix.\n  - Every face of $P$ has a totally unimodular face-defining matrix.\n  - For every face $F$ of $P$, lin($F$) has a totally unimodular basis.\n  Along our proof, we show that a cone $\\{x:Ax\\leq \\mathbf{0}\\}$ is box-TDI if\nand only if it is box-integer, and that these properties are passed on to its\npolar.\n  We illustrate the use of these characterizations by reviewing well known\nresults about box-TDI polyhedra. We also provide several applications. The\nfirst one is a new perspective on the equivalence between two results about\nbinary clutters. Secondly, we refute a conjecture of Ding, Zang, and Zhao about\nbox-perfect graphs. Thirdly, we discuss connections with an abstract class of\npolyhedra having the Integer Carath\\'eodory Property. Finally, we characterize\nthe box-TDIness of the cone of conservative functions of a graph and provide a\ncorresponding box-TDI system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 12:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

For example, the $O(n^2)$ dynamic programming solution to\nthe Longest Common Subsequence problem (LCS) was improved to $O(n^2/\\log^2 n)$\nin several ways and using a variety of ingenious tricks. This line of research,\nalso known as \"the art of shaving log factors\", lacks a tool for proving\nnegative results. Specifically, how can we show that it is unlikely that LCS\ncan be solved in time $O(n^2/\\log^3 n)$?\n  Perhaps the only approach for such results was suggested in a recent paper of\nAbboud, Hansen, Vassilevska W. and Williams (STOC'16).

They show that an\n$O(n^2/\\log^{1000} n)$ algorithm for LCS would imply a major advance in circuit\nlower bounds. Whether this approach can lead to tighter barriers was unclear.\n  In this paper, we push this approach to its limit and, in particular, prove\nthat a well-known barrier from complexity theory stands in the way for shaving\nfive additional log factors for fundamental combinatorial problems. For LCS,\nregular expression pattern matching, as well as the Fr\\'echet distance problem\nfrom Computational Geometry, we show that an $O(n^2/\\log^{7+\\varepsilon} n)$\nruntime would imply new Formula-SAT algorithms.\n  Our main result is a reduction from SAT on formulas of size $s$ over $n$\nvariables to LCS on sequences of length $N=2^{n/2} \\cdot s^{1+o(1)}$.

Echo State Network (ESN)\nis a recent specific kind of Recurrent Neural Network which presents very rich\ndynamics thanks to its reservoir-based hidden layer.

It is found that the magnetic effect plays\nthe role of a catalyzer for the topological phase transition (topological\ndeformation for the skyrmion crystal configuration from the skrymion phase to\nhalf-skyrmion phase). Furthermore, we observe that in the presence of the\nmagnetic field, the inhomogeneous chiral condensate persists both in the\nskyrmion and half-skyrmion phases. Explicitly, as the strength of magnetic\nfield gets larger, the inhomogeneous chiral condensate in the skyrmion phase\ntends to be drastically localized, while in the half-skyrmion phase the\ninhomogeneity configuration is hardly affected. It also turns out that a large\nmagnetic effect in a low density region distorts the baryon shape to an\nelliptic form but the crystal structure is intact. However, in a high density\nregion, the crystal structure is strongly effected by the strong magnetic\nfield. A possible correlation between the chiral inhomogeneity and the\ndeformation of the skrymion configuration is also addressed. The results\nobtained in this paper might be realized in the deep interior of compact stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 13:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 15:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Given a\ntime deadline, the goal is to maximize the sum-rate of transmitters under\nrandom energy arrivals with both perfect and imperfect channel state\ninformation (CSI) at the receiver. The original sumrate maximization (SRM)\nproblem is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP). To obtain the\noptimal scheduling policy, we first reduce the original optimization problem to\na convex MINLP and solve it using the generalized Benders decomposition\nalgorithm. We observe that the SRM problem results in an unfair rate allocation\namong transmitters, i.e., the transmitter closer to the receiver achieves a\nhigher rate than that by the transmitter farther from the receiver. Hence, to\ninduce fairness among transmitters, we consider the minimumrate maximization\n(MRM) problem.

Without friction, the contact line\nshows a stick-slip behaviour and a dot-like deposit is left after the droplet\nis evaporated.

However, applying this Suns-VOC\ntechnique to perovskite cells is problematic since the VOC evolves with time in\na way which depends on the previously applied bias (Vpre), the light intensity,\nand the device architecture/processing. Here we show that the dominant\nrecombination mechanism in two structurally similar CH3NH3PbI3 devices\ncontaining either mesoporous Al2O3 or TiO2 layers can be identified from the\nsignature of the transient ideality factor following application of a forward\nbias, Vpre, to the device in the dark. The transient ideality factor, is\nmeasured by monitoring the temporal evolution of VOC at different light\nintensities. The initial values of the transient ideality were consistent with\ncorresponding photoluminescence vs intensity as well as electroluminescence vs\ncurrent density measurements. Time-dependent simulations of the measurement on\nmodelled devices, which include the effects of mobile ionic charge, show that\nShockley Read Hall (SRH) recombination through deep traps at the charge\ncollection interfaces is dominant in both devices. Using transient photovoltage\nmeasurements superimposed on the evolving VOC of bifacial devices we further\nshow that the charge collection interface extends throughout the mesoporous\nTiO2 layer, consistent with a transient ideality signature corresponding to SRH\nrecombination in the bulk of the film. This information could not be inferred\nfrom an ideality factor determined from only steady-state VOC values.

Lyman continuum irradiation\ngreatly increases the level of ionisation in the uppermost atmospheric regions.\nOur results suggest that a shell of an almost fully ionised atmospheric gas\nemerges for brown dwarfs in star forming regions and brown dwarfs in white\ndwarf binary systems. As a consequence, brown dwarf atmospheres can be\nmagnetically coupled which is the presumption for chromospheric heating to\noccur and for Aurorae to emerge. First tests for assumed chromosphere-like\ntemperature values suggest that the resulting free-free X-ray luminosities are\ncomparable with those observed from non-accreting brown dwarfs in star forming\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 14:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

This means that close to a maximum, the poles look like\ntypical limb, quiet-Sun regions. However, the magnetic field distributions at\nthe limbs are different from the distribution inferred at disc centre. At the\nlimbs, we infer a new population of magnetic fields with relatively strong\nintensities ($\\sim$600-$\\sim$800 G), inclined by 30 deg with respect to the\nline of sight, and with an azimuth aligned with the solar disc radial\ndirection.

These loops\nhave typical granular sizes as measured in the disc centre. At the limbs, where\nthe spatial resolution decreases, we observe them spatially unresolved, which\nexplains the new population of magnetic fields that is inferred. This is the\nfirst (indirect) evidence of small-scale magnetic loops outside the disc centre\nand would imply that these small-scale structures are ubiquitous on the entire\nsolar surface.

We argue this is a more realistic setting in the presence of\nmassive amounts of content, most of which cannot be easily factchecked. To that\nend, we represent collections of news articles as multi-dimensional tensors,\nleverage tensor decomposition to derive concise article embeddings that capture\nspatial/contextual information about each news article, and use those\nembeddings to create an article-by-article graph on which we propagate limited\nlabels. Results on three real-world datasets show that our method performs on\npar or better than existing models that are fully supervised, in that we\nachieve better detection accuracy using fewer labels. In particular, our\nproposed method achieves 75.43% of accuracy using only 30% of labels of a\npublic dataset while an SVM-based classifier achieved 67.43%. Furthermore, our\nmethod achieves 70.92% of accuracy in a large dataset using only 2% of labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 15:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

To cope with this\ndynamicity in a cost-efficient manner, operators need advanced service\nmanagement capabilities such as those provided by NFV. NFV enables operators to\nscale network services with higher granularity and agility than today. For this\nend, automation is key. In search of this automation, the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has defined a reference NFV\nframework that make use of model-driven templates called Network Service\nDescriptors (NSDs) to operate network services through their lifecycle. For the\nscaling operation, an NSD defines a discrete set of instantiation levels among\nwhich a network service instance can be resized throughout its lifecycle. Thus,\nthe design of these levels is key for ensuring an effective scaling. In this\narticle, we provide an overview of the automation of the network service\nscaling operation in NFV, addressing the options and boundaries introduced by\nETSI normative specifications. We start by providing a description of the NSD\nstructure, focusing on how instantiation levels are constructed. For\nillustrative purposes, we propose an NSD for a representative NS. This NSD\nincludes different instantiation levels that enable different ways to\nautomatically scale this NS. Then, we show the different scaling procedures the\nNFV framework has available, and how it may automate their triggering. Finally,\nwe propose an ETSI-compliant workflow to describe in detail a representative\nscaling procedure.

Here, we report on an alternative\ngelation method based on physical inter-NC interactions: short-range\ndepletion-attractions balanced by long-range electrostatic repulsions. The\nlatter are established by removing the native organic ligands that passivate\ntin-doped indium oxide (ITO) NCs while the former are introduced by mixing with\nsmall polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. As we incorporate increasing\nconcentrations of PEG, we observe a reentrant phase behavior featuring two\nfavorable gelation windows; the first arises from bridging effects while the\nsecond is attributed to depletion-attractions according to phase behavior\npredicted by our unified theoretical model. The NCs remain discrete within the\ngel network, based on X-ray scattering and high-resolution transmission\nelectron microscopy. The infrared optical response of the gel is reflective of\nboth the NC building blocks and the network architecture, being characteristic\nof ITO NC LSPR with coupling interactions between neighboring NCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 15:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

However, the generated\nexcitons have short lifetimes (ps) and are also subject to the electron-hole\nexchange interaction leading to fast relaxation of the valley pseudospin and\ncoherence.

Instead, stochastic\nconditional gradient methods are proposed as an alternative solution relying on\n(i) Approximating gradients via a simple averaging technique requiring a single\nstochastic gradient evaluation per iteration; (ii) Solving a linear program to\ncompute the descent/ascent direction. The averaging technique reduces the noise\nof gradient approximations as time progresses, and replacing projection step in\nproximal methods by a linear program lowers the computational complexity of\neach iteration. We show that under convexity and smoothness assumptions, our\nproposed method converges to the optimal objective function value at a\nsublinear rate of $O(1/t^{1/3})$. Further, for a monotone and continuous\nDR-submodular function and subject to a general convex body constraint, we\nprove that our proposed method achieves a $((1-1/e)OPT-\\eps)$ guarantee with\n$O(1/\\eps^3)$ stochastic gradient computations. This guarantee matches the\nknown hardness results and closes the gap between deterministic and stochastic\ncontinuous submodular maximization. Additionally, we obtain $((1/e)OPT -\\eps)$\nguarantee after using $O(1/\\eps^3)$ stochastic gradients for the case that the\nobjective function is continuous DR-submodular but non-monotone and the\nconstraint set is down-closed. By using stochastic continuous optimization as\nan interface, we provide the first $(1-1/e)$ tight approximation guarantee for\nmaximizing a monotone but stochastic submodular set function subject to a\nmatroid constraint and $(1/e)$ approximation guarantee for the non-monotone\ncase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 13:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 18:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

The optimization of a patch-fed dielectric\nrod antenna design at millimeter wave band is presented in this work. This\ndesign is composed of simple dielectric rod antenna made of low cost Teflon\nwith relative permittivity of 2.1 that is fed by a rectangular patch antenna.\nCompared to the conventionally used tapered dielectric rod antennas, this\nconfiguration is capable of producing higher gain for a given antenna length.\nThe design is optimized to achieve gain up to 17.5 dBi and impedance bandwidth\nup to 4.4 GHz at 60 GHz. A 4-element array is proposed to increase the gain up\nto 21 dBi. Simulations are performed using CST microwave studio, and their\nresults are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 20:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

It is generally modeled as a stochastic\nprocess and have been studied through different techniques by comparing the\nhistoric time series of demand, supply and the price itself. However, there are\nmany historic events where the demand or supply changes are not sufficient in\nexplaining the price changes. In such cases, it is the expectations on the\nfuture changes of demand or supply that causes heavy and quick influences on\nthe price. There are many parameters and variables that shape these\nexpectations, and are usually neglected in traditional models. In this paper,\nwe have proposed a model based on System Dynamics approach that takes into\naccount these non-traditional factors. The validity of the proposed model is\nthen evaluated using real and potential scenarios in which the proposed model\nfollows the trend of the real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 05:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}
