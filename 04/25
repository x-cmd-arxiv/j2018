This simplicity has led to\na variety of numerically exact quantum methods for reduced density matrix\npropagation. When using these methods, a spectral density has to be computed\nfrom dynamical properties of system and environment, which is commonly done\nusing classical molecular dynamics simulations. However, there are situations,\nwhere quantum effects could play a role. Therefore, we reformulate our recently\ndeveloped Fourier method in order to enable spectral density calculations from\nsemiclassical simulations which approximately consider quantum effects. We\npropose two possible protocols based on either correlation functions or\nexpectation values. These protocols are tested for the linearized semiclassical\ninitial-value representation (LSC-IVR), the thawed Gaussian wave packet\ndynamics (TGWD) and hybrid schemes combining the two with the more accurate\nHerman-Kluk (HK) formula. Surprisingly, spectral densities from the LSC-IVR\nmethod, based on a completely classical propagation, are extremely accurate\nwhereas those from the single-trajectory TGWD are of poor quality in the\nanharmonic regime. The hybrid methods provide reasonable quality when the\nsystem is close to the classical regime, although, at finite temperature, the\ncomputation protocol from expectation values turns out to be more robust. If\nstronger quantum effects are observed, both hybrid methods turn out as too\ninaccurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 16:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Long-term, multi-filter, high-cadence monitoring of large YSO\nsamples is the key to understand the partly unusual light-curves that many of\nthese objects show. Here we introduce and present the first results of the\nHOYS-CAPS citizen science project which aims to perform such monitoring for\nnearby (d<1kpc) and young (age<10Myr) clusters and star forming regions,\nvisible from the northern hemisphere, with small telescopes. We have identified\nand characterised 466 variable (413 confirmed young) stars in 8 young, nearby\nclusters. All sources vary by at least 0.2mag in V, have been observed at least\n15 times in V, R and I in the same night over a period of about 2yrs and have a\nStetson index of larger than 1. This is one of the largest samples of variable\nYSOs observed over such a time-span and cadence in multiple filters. About two\nthirds of our sample are classical T-Tauri stars, while the rest are objects\nwith depleted or transition disks. Objects characterised as bursters show by\nfar the highest variability.

Detecting QoS violations after the fact is even more\ndetrimental when a service consists of hundreds of thousands of loosely-coupled\nmicroservices, since performance hiccups can quickly propagate across the\ndependency graph of microservices. In this work we focus on anticipating QoS\nviolations in cloud settings to mitigate performance unpredictability to begin\nwith.

Once an imminent QoS violation is detected Seer\nuses machine-level hardware events to determine the cause of the QoS violation,\nand adjusts the resource allocations to prevent it. In local clusters with 10\n40-core servers and 200-instance clusters on GCE running diverse cloud\nmicroservices, we show that Seer correctly anticipates QoS violations 91% of\nthe time, and attributes the violation to the correct microservice in 89% of\ncases.

The quantum maximum\nentropy method is found to be a \"universal method of density matrix inference\"\nas it can process information about data and moments simultaneously (giving\njoint generalized quantum inference solutions), which when processed separately\ngives the Quantum Bayes Rule [2,39] or a canonical quantum (von Neumann)\nmaximum entropy solution [10], respectively, as special cases.\n  The second part of this thesis revolves around a foundational theory of QM\ncalled Entropic Dynamics (ED) [13].

Our goal is\nto analyze how price impact affects optimal policies, as well as both pricing\nrules and demand schedules for contingent claims. For exponential market makers\npreferences, we establish two effects due to price impact: constrained trading,\nand non-linear hedging costs. To the former, wealth processes in the impact\nmodel are identified with those in a model without impact, but with constrained\ntrading, where the (random) constraint set is generically neither closed nor\nconvex. Regarding hedging, non-linear hedging costs motivate the study of\narbitrage free prices for the claim. We provide three such notions, which\ncoincide in the frictionless case, but which dramatically differ in the\npresence of price impact. Additionally, we show arbitrage opportunities, should\nthey arise from claim prices, can be exploited only for limited position sizes,\nand may be ignored if outweighed by hedging considerations. We also show that\narbitrage inducing prices may arise endogenously in equilibrium, and that\nequilibrium positions are inversely proportional to the market makers'\nrepresentative risk aversion. Therefore, large positions endogenously arise in\nthe limit of either market maker risk neutrality, or a large number of market\nmakers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 17:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 18:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

In the\nsimplest version L\\'evy walks move with a finite speed. Here, we present an\nextension of the L\\'evy walk scenario for the case when external force fields\ninfluence the motion. The resulting motion is a combination of the response to\nthe deterministic force acting on the particle, changing its velocity according\nto the principle of total energy conservation, and random velocity reversals\ngoverned by the distribution of waiting times. For the fact that the motion\nstays conservative, that is, on a constant energy surface, our scenario is\nfundamentally different from thermal motion in the same external potentials. In\nparticular, we present results for the velocity and position distributions for\nsingle well potentials of different steepness. The observed dynamics with its\ncontinuous velocity changes enriches the theory of L\\'evy walk processes and\nwill be of use in a variety of systems, for which the particles are externally\nconfined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 17:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 21:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 16:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

We show that the K\\\"ahler\ngeometry can be described by a $U(1)$ gauge theory on a symplectic manifold\nwith a slight generalization. We derive a natural Poisson algebra associated\nwith the K\\\"ahler geometry we have started with. The quantization of the\nunderlying Poisson algebra leads to a noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theory which\narguably describes a quantized K\\\"ahler geometry. The Hilbert space\nrepresentation of quantized K\\\"ahler geometry eventually ends in a\nzero-dimensional matrix model.

The MM1 core is fragmented into six compact sources\ncoexisting within $\\sim 1000$ au. In our models, three of these compact sources\nare better represented as disc-envelope systems around a central (proto)star,\ntwo as envelopes with a central object, and one as a pure envelope. The model\nof the most prominent object (Main) contains the most massive (proto)star\n($M_\\star\\approx7~M_\\odot$) and disc+envelope\n($M_\\mathrm{gas}\\approx0.4~M_\\odot$), and is the most luminous\n($L_\\mathrm{Main} \\sim 10^4~L_\\odot$). The model discs are small (a few hundred\nau) for all sources. The composite model shows that the elongated spiral-like\nfeature converging to the MM1 core can be convincingly interpreted as a\nfilamentary accretion flow that feeds the rising stellar system. The kinematics\nof this filament is reproduced by a parabolic trajectory with focus at the\ncenter of mass of the region. Radial collapse and fragmentation within this\nfilament, as well as smaller filamentary flows between pairs of sources are\nproposed to exist. Our modelling supports an interpretation where what was once\nconsidered as a single massive star with a $\\sim 10^3$ au disc and envelope, is\ninstead a forming stellar association which appears to be virialized and to\nform several low-mass stars per high-mass object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 18:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

This suggests an important difference between the sources either in\ntheir evolutionary stage or warm-up timescales.

As it is the case for all semiconductors, however, the\nphysical response of these systems is strongly determined by defects in a way\nspecific to each individual compound. Here we investigate the ability of\nexfoliated monolayers of these TMDCs to support high-quality, well-balanced\nambipolar conduction, which has been demonstrated for WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and\nWSe$_2$, but not for MoS$_2$. Using ionic-liquid gated transistors we show\nthat, contrary to WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$, hole transport in exfoliated\nMoS$_2$ monolayers is systematically anomalous, exhibiting a maximum in\nconductivity at negative gate voltage (V$_G$) followed by a suppression of up\nto 100 times upon further increasing V$_G$. To understand the origin of this\ndifference we have performed a series of experiments including the comparison\nof hole transport in MoS$_2$ monolayers and thicker multilayers, in exfoliated\nand CVD-grown monolayers, as well as gate-dependent optical measurements (Raman\nand photoluminescence) and scanning tunneling imaging and spectroscopy.

An example is\nin air traffic control, where we aim to identify the leading indicators for\neach type of accident cause from historical records. Among all three types of\naccident causes, historical records with 'personnel issues' are much more than\nthe other two types ('aircraft issues' and 'environmental issues') combined.\nThus, the resulting dataset is highly imbalanced, and can be naturally modeled\nas a network. Up until now, most existing work on imbalanced data analysis\nfocused on the classification setting, and very little is devoted to learning\nthe node representation from imbalanced networks. To address this problem, in\nthis paper, we propose Vertex-Diminished Random Walk (VDRW) for imbalanced\nnetwork analysis. The key idea is to encourage the random particle to walk\nwithin the same class by adjusting the transition probabilities each step. It\nresembles the existing Vertex Reinforced Random Walk in terms of the dynamic\nnature of the transition probabilities, as well as some convergence properties.\nHowever, it is more suitable for analyzing imbalanced networks as it leads to\nmore separable node representations in the embedding space. Then, based on\nVDRW, we propose a semi-supervised network representation learning framework\nnamed ImVerde for imbalanced networks, in which context sampling uses VDRW and\nthe label information to create node-context pairs, and balanced-batch sampling\nadopts a simple under-sampling method to balance these pairs in different\nclasses. Experimental results demonstrate that ImVerde based on VDRW\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for learning network representation\nfrom imbalanced data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 19:18:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Unfortunately, ensembles cannot generally be\nconsidered as a sample from such a predictive probability distribution without\na preliminary post-processing treatment to calibrate the ensemble. Two main\nfamilies of post-processing methods, either competing such as BMA or\ncollaborative such as EMOS, can be found in the literature.

By virtue of the\nCayley-Hamilton theorem for characteristic polynomials and the\nCoulson-Rushbrooke pairing theorem for alternant hydrocarbons, it is possible\nto derive a finite series expansion of the Green's function for electron\ntransmission in terms of the odd powers of the vertex adjacency matrix or\nH{\\\"u}ckel matrix. This means that only odd-length walks on a molecular graph\ncontribute to the conductivity through a molecule. Thus, if there are only\neven-length walks between two atoms, quantum interference is expected to occur\nin the electron transport between them. However, even if there are only\nodd-length walks between two atoms, a situation may come about where the\ncontributions to the QI of some odd-length walks are canceled by others,\nleading to another class of quantum interference. For non-alternant\nhydrocarbons, the finite Green's function expansion may include both even and\nodd powers. Nevertheless, QI can in some circumstances come about for\nnon-alternants, from the cancellation of odd and even-length walk terms. We\nreport some progress, but not a complete resolution of the problem of\nunderstanding the coefficients in the expansion of the Green's function in a\npower series of the adjacency matrix, these coefficients being behind the\ncancellations that we have mentioned.

Both statistical and\nclassical methods are used for the forward and inverse problems, so that the\ncontributions to the overall uncertainty of the measured quantities can be\nevaluated. The correlations between the parameters are taken into account\nthrough the Bayesian inference with error-in-variable (EiV) model. In the\nforward problem, very small differences were found when using Monte Carlo (MC),\nPolynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and linear perturbation methods. In flow\nvelocity measurements with HWA, the results indicate that the estimated\nuncertainty is lower when the correlations among parameters are considered,\nthan when they are not taken into account. Moreover, global sensitivity\nanalyses with Sobol indices showed that the HWA measurements are most sensitive\nto the wire voltage, and in the case of OFI the most sensitive factor is the\ncalculation of fringe velocity. The relative errors in wall-shear stress,\nfriction velocity and viscous length are 0.44%, 0.23% and 0.22%, respectively.\nNote that these values are lower than the ones reported in other wall-bounded\nturbulence studies. Note that in most studies of wall-bounded turbulence the\ncorrelations among parameters are not considered, and the uncertainties from\nthe various parameters are directly added when determining the overall\nuncertainty of the measured quantity. In the present analysis we account for\nthese correlations, which may lead to a lower overall uncertainty estimate due\nto error cancellation.

This is accomplished by projecting the\nhigh-dimensional dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace, typically utilizing\ndimensionality reduction techniques like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD),\ncoupled with Galerkin projection.

Its continuous evolution\nwith doping directly connects the Mott insulator and high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. We show this by numerically studying the extremely small\ndoping region close to the Mott insulating phase in a standard model for\ncuprates, the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We first identify two relevant\nself-energy structures in the Mott insulator; the pole generating the Mott gap\nand a relatively broad peak generating the so-called waterfall structure, which\nis another consequence of strong correlations present in the Mott insulator. We\nnext reveal that either the Mott-gap pole or the waterfall structure (the\nfeature at the energy closer to the Fermi level) directly transforms itself\ninto another self-energy pole at the same energy and momentum when the system\nis doped with carriers. The anomalous self-energy yielding the\nsuperconductivity is simultaneously born exactly at this energy-momentum point.\nThus created self-energy pole, interpreted as arising from a hidden fermionic\nexcitation, continuously evolves upon further doping and considerably enhances\nthe superconductivity. Above the critical temperature, the same self-energy\npole generates a pseudogap in the normal state.

The major limitations of such theories include unbounded rationality of\neconomic agents, reducing the economic aggregates to a set of predictable\nfactors and lack of attention to adaptability and the evolutionary nature of\neconomic agents.

However, a deeper understanding of how weak labels affect the\nlearning for sound events is still missing from literature. In this work, we\nfirst describe a CNN based approach for weakly supervised training of audio\nevents. The approach follows some basic design principle desirable in a\nlearning method relying on weakly labeled audio. We then describe important\ncharacteristics, which naturally arise in weakly supervised learning of sound\nevents. We show how these aspects of weak labels affect the generalization of\nmodels. More specifically, we study how characteristics such as label density\nand corruption of labels affects weakly supervised training for audio events.\nWe also study the feasibility of directly obtaining weak labeled data from the\nweb without any manual label and compare it with a dataset which has been\nmanually labeled. The analysis and understanding of these factors should be\ntaken into picture in the development of future weak label learning methods.\nAudioset, a large scale weakly labeled dataset for sound events is used in our\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 23:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

Outliers deviated from the uniform sparsity pattern in each group may\nsignificantly degrade the effectiveness of common sparsity, and hence bring\nlimited (or negative) gain for channel estimation. To better capture the group\nsparse structure in practice, we provide a general model having two sparsity\ncomponents: commonly shared sparsity and individual sparsity, where the\nadditional individual sparsity accounts for any outliers. Then, we propose a\nnovel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based framework to address the joint\nchannel estimation and user grouping problem under the general sparsity model.\nThe framework can fully exploit the common sparsity among nearby users and\nexclude the harmful effect from outliers simultaneously.

In this work, we aim to derive the\nfundamental parameters of a close triple star system, HD 188753, for which\nasteroseismic and astrometric observations allow independent measurements of\nstellar masses. We used six months of Kepler photometry available for HD 188753\nto detect the oscillation envelopes of the two brightest stars.

We then derived initial guesses\nof the stellar masses and ages based on two seismic parameters and on a\ncharacteristic frequency ratio, and modelled the two components independently\nwith the stellar evolution code CESTAM. In addition, we derived the masses of\nthe three stars by applying a Bayesian analysis to the position and\nradial-velocity measurements of the system. Based on stellar modelling, the\nmean common age of the system is $10.8 \\pm 0.2\\,$Gyr and the masses of the two\nseismic components are $M_A =$ $0.99 \\pm 0.01\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_{Ba} =$ $0.86\n\\pm 0.01\\,M_\\odot$.

One of\nthe key issues for a workforce diversity campaign is to understand in real-time\nwho is participating - specifically, whether the participants are individuals\nor organizations, and in case of individuals, whether they are male or female.\nIn this paper, we present a study to demonstrate a case for AI for social good\nthat develops a model to infer in real-time the different user types\nparticipating in a cause-driven hashtag campaign on Twitter,\nILookLikeAnEngineer (ILLAE). A generic framework is devised to classify a\nTwitter user into three classes: organization, male and female in a real-time\nmanner. The framework is tested against two datasets (ILLAE and a general\ndataset) and outperforms the baseline binary classifiers for categorizing\norganization/individual and male/female. The proposed model can be applied to\nfuture social cause-driven campaigns to get real-time insights on the\nmacro-level social behavior of participants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 00:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

The optimal importance sampling density was\nderived in 1950s for the deterministic simulation model, which maps an input to\nan output deterministically, and is approximated in practice using various\nmethods. For the stochastic simulation model whose output is random given an\ninput, the optimal importance sampling density was derived only recently. In\nthe existing literature, metamodel-based approaches have been used to\napproximate this optimal density. However, building a satisfactory metamodel is\noften difficult or time-consuming in practice. This paper proposes a\ncross-entropy based method, which is automatic and does not require specific\ndomain knowledge. The proposed method uses an expectation-maximization\nalgorithm to guide the choice of a mixture distribution model for approximating\nthe optimal density. The method iteratively updates the approximated density to\nminimize its estimated discrepancy, measured by estimated cross-entropy, from\nthe optimal density. The mixture model's complexity is controlled using the\ncross-entropy information criterion.

Here we investigate the spatial\ncoherence of highly multimode lasers in the regime of short time scales.\nCounter intuitively, we show that in this regime, the temporal (longitudinal)\nmodes play a crucial role in spatial coherence reduction. To evaluate the\nspatial coherence we measured the temporal dynamics of speckle fields generated\nby a highly multimode laser with over $10^5$ lasing spatial (transverse) modes,\nand examined the dependence of speckle contrast on the exposure time of the\ndetecting device. We show that in the regime of short time scale, the spatial\nand temporal modes interact to form spatio-temporal supermodes, such that the\nspatial degrees of freedom are encoded onto the temporal modes. As a result,\nthe speckle contrast depends on the number of temporal modes, and the degree of\nspatial coherence is reduced and the speckle contrast is suppressed. In the\nregime of long times scale, the supermodes are no longer a valid representation\nof the laser modal structure. Consequently, the spatial coherence is\nindependent of the temporal modes, and the classical result, where the speckle\ncontrast is suppressed as the number of spatial modes, is obtained. Due to this\nnew spatio-temporal mechanism, highly multimode lasers can be used for speckle\nsuppression in high-speed full-field imaging applications, as we demonstrate\nhere for imaging of a fast moving object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 01:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

In this work, we introduce a new class of priors, called\nthe jointly robust prior, for both the emulation and calibration. This prior is\ndesigned to maintain various advantages from the reference prior. In emulation,\nthe jointly robust prior has an appropriate tail decay rate as the reference\nprior, and is computationally simpler than the reference prior in parameter\nestimation. Moreover, the marginal posterior mode estimation with the jointly\nrobust prior can separate the influential and inert inputs in mathematical\nmodels, while the reference prior does not have this property.

This class of objectives gives rise to an interesting trade-off between\nfull and partial information. As in full observation, the strategy in the MDP\ncan depend on the state of the system, but similar to partial information, the\nstrategy needs to account for all the states at the same time. In this paper,\nwe focus on two safety problems that arise naturally in this context, namely,\nexistential and universal safety. Given an MDP A and a closed and convex\npolytope H of probability distributions over the states of A, the existential\nsafety problem asks whether there exists some distribution d in H and a\nstrategy of A, such that starting from d and repeatedly applying this strategy\nkeeps the distribution forever in H. The universal safety problem asks whether\nfor all distributions in H, there exists such a strategy of A which keeps the\ndistribution forever in H. We prove that both problems are decidable, with\ntight complexity bounds: we show that existential safety is PTIME-complete,\nwhile universal safety is co-NP-complete. Further, we compare these results\nwith existential and universal safety problems for Rabin's probabilistic\nfinite-state automata (PFA), the subclass of Partially Observable MDPs which\nhave zero observation. Compared to MDPs, strategies of PFAs are not\nstate-dependent. In sharp contrast to the PTIME result, we show that\nexistential safety for PFAs is undecidable, with H having closed and open\nboundaries. On the other hand, it turns out that the universal safety for PFAs\nis decidable in EXPTIME, with a co-NP lower bound. Finally, we show that an\nalternate representation of the input polytope allows us to improve the\ncomplexity of universal safety for MDPs and PFAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 04:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

To this end, two new\nquantities, called maximum incremental and minimum decremental ratios are\nintroduced; and a polynomial-time procedure is developed to calculate them. The\nsecond part of the paper is devoted to introducing and investigating left- and\nright-hand RTS notions in FDH models. Some necessary and sufficient conditions\nare established, leading to a polynomial-time test for identification of the\none-sided RTS status of DMUs. Finally, the relationships between one-sided RTS,\nGlobal RTS (GRS), and the newly-defined ratios are established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 05:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

In this work, we study the age-optimal\ntrajectory planning problem in UAV-enabled wireless sensor networks, where a\nUAV is dispatched to collect data from the ground sensor nodes (SNs). The age\nof information (AoI) collected from each SN is characterized by the data\nuploading time and the time elapsed since the UAV leaves this SN. We attempt to\ndesign two age-optimal trajectories, referred to as the Max-AoI-optimal and\nAve-AoI-optimal trajectories, respectively. The Max-AoI-optimal trajectory\nplanning is to minimize the age of the `oldest' sensed information among the\nSNs. The Ave-AoI-optimal trajectory planning is to minimize the average AoI of\nall the SNs. Then, we show that each age-optimal flight trajectory corresponds\nto a shortest Hamiltonian path in the wireless sensor network where the\ndistance between any two SNs represents the amount of inter-visit time. The\ndynamic programming (DP) method and genetic algorithm (GA) are adopted to find\nthe two different age-optimal trajectories.

The internal analysis of the\ndata shows that the photometric calibrations can reach a precision as low as 2\nmmag on individual CCD measurements. Other tests show that systematic effects\nare present in the data at the 10 mmag level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 06:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 12:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Aims: This paper provides a detailed description of\nthe Gaia spectroscopic data processing pipeline, and of the approach adopted to\nderive the radial velocities presented in DR2. Methods: The pipeline must\nperform four main tasks: (i) clean and reduce the spectra observed with the\nRadial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS); (ii) calibrate the RVS instrument,\nincluding wavelength, straylight, line-spread function, bias non-uniformity,\nand photometric zeropoint; (iii) extract the radial velocities; and (iv) verify\nthe accuracy and precision of the results. The radial velocity of a star is\nobtained through a fit of the RVS spectrum relative to an appropriate synthetic\ntemplate spectrum. An additional task of the spectroscopic pipeline was to\nprovide 1st-order estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters required to\nselect such template spectra. We describe the pipeline features and present the\ndetailed calibration algorithms and software solutions we used to produce the\nradial velocities published in DR2. Results: The spectroscopic processing\npipeline produced median radial velocities for Gaia stars with narrow-band\nnear-IR magnitude Grvs < 12 (i.e. brighter than V~13). Stars identified as\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binaries were removed from the pipeline, while\nvariable stars, single-lined, and non-detected double-lined spectroscopic\nbinaries were treated as single stars. The scatter in radial velocity among\ndifferent observations of a same star, also published in DR2, provides\ninformation about radial velocity variability.

To exploit the epoch astrometry of asteroids in Gaia DR2 it is\nnecessary to take into account the unusual properties of the uncertainty, as\nthe position information is nearly one-dimensional. When this aspect is handled\nappropriately, an orbit fit can be obtained with post-fit residuals that are\noverall consistent with the a-priori error model that was used to define\nindividual values of the astrometric uncertainty. The distribution of residuals\nallowed us to identify possible contaminants in the data set. Photometry in the\nG band was compared to computed values from reference asteroid shapes and to\nthe flux registered at the corresponding epochs by the red and blue photometers\n(RP and BP). The overall astrometric performance is close to the expectations,\nwith an optimal range of brightness G~12-17. In this range, the typical\ntransit-level accuracy is well below 1 mas. For fainter asteroids, the growing\nphoton noise deteriorates the performance. Asteroids brighter than G~12 are\naffected by a lower performance of the processing of their signals. The\ndramatic improvement brought by Gaia DR2 astrometry of SSOs is demonstrated by\npreliminary tests on the detection of subtle non-gravitational effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 06:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

The latter can be identified\nwith the semidirect product of the maximal compact subgroup $ K $ acting on $\n\\mathfrak{k}^* $ via the coadjoint action.\n  In the quantum case the role of the Cartan motion group is played by the\nDrinfeld double of the classical group $ K $, whose associated group $ C^*\n$-algebra is the crossed product of $ C(K) $ with respect to the adjoint action\nof $ K $. Our quantum assembly map is obtained by varying the deformation\nparameter in the Drinfeld double construction applied to the standard\ndeformation $ K_q $ of $ K $.

This improves on\n[Dragan, WG'97], who proposed such an algorithm for the subclass of\n(tent,hexahedron)-free distance-hereditary graphs. Furthermore, our result is\nderived from a more general one that is obtained for b-Matching. In the (unit\ncost) b-Matching problem, we are given a graph G = (V, E) together with a\nnonnegative integer capacity b v for every vertex v $\\in$ V. The objective is\nto assign nonnegative integer weights (x e) e$\\in$E so that: for every v $\\in$\nV the sum of the weights of its incident edges does not exceed b v , and\ne$\\in$E x e is maximized. We present the first algorithm for solving b-Matching\non cographs, distance-hereditary graphs and some of their generalizations in\nquasi linear time. For that, we use a decomposition algorithm that outputs for\nany graph G a collection of subgraphs of G with no edge-cutsets inducing a\ncomplete bipartite subgraph (a.k.a., splits). The latter collection is\nsometimes called a split decomposition of G. Furthermore, there exists a\ngeneric method in order to design graph algorithms based on split decomposition\n[Rao, DAM'08]. However, this technique only applies to \"localized\" problems:\nfor which a \"best\" partial solution for any given subgraph in a split\ndecomposition can be computed almost independently from the remaining of the\ngraph. Such framework does not apply to matching problems since an augmenting\npath may cross the subgraphs arbitrarily. We introduce a new technique that\nsomehow captures all the partial solutions for a given union of subgraphs in a\nsplit decomposition, in a compact and amenable way for algorithms - assuming\nsome piecewise linear assumption holds on the value of such solutions. The\nlatter assumption is shown to hold for b-Matching. Doing so, we prove that\nsolving b-Matching on any pair G, b can be reduced in quasi linear-time to\nsolving this problem on a collection of smaller graphs: that are obtained from\nthe subgraphs in any split decomposition of G by replacing every vertex with a\nconstant-size module. In particular, if G has a split decomposition where all\nsubgraphs have order at most a fixed k, then we can solve b-Matching for G, b\nin O((k log 2 k)$\\times$(m+n)$\\times$log ||b|| 1)-time.

A major\ndifficulty in this task is that the Maximum Matching problem is not preserved\nby quotient, thereby making difficult to exploit the structural properties of\nthe quotient subgraphs of the modular decomposition. So far, we are only aware\nof a recent framework in [Coudert et al., SODA'18] that only applies when the\nquotient subgraphs have bounded order and/or under additional assumptions on\nthe nontriv-ial modules in the graph. As a first attempt toward improving this\nframework we study the combined effect of modular decomposition with a pruning\nprocess over the quotient subgraphs. More precisely, we remove sequentially\nfrom all such subgraphs their so-called one-vertex extensions (i.e., pendant,\nanti-pendant, twin, universal and isolated vertices). Doing so, we obtain a\n\"pruned modular decomposition\", that can be computed in O(m log n)-time. Our\nmain result is that if all the pruned quotient subgraphs have bounded order\nthen a maximum matching can be computed in linear time. This result is mostly\nbased on two pruning rules on pendant and anti-pendant modules -- that are\nadjacent, respectively, to one or all but one other modules in the graph.\nFurthermore, these two latter rules are surprisingly intricate and we consider\nthem as our main technical contribution in the paper. We stress that the class\nof graphs that can be totally decomposed by the pruned modular decomposition\ncontains all the distance-hereditary graphs, and so, it is larger than\ncographs. In particular, as a byproduct of our approach we also obtain the\nfirst known linear-time algorithms for Maximum Matching on distance-hereditary\ngraphs and graphs with modular-treewidth at most one. Finally, we can use an\nextended version of our framework in order to compute a maximum matching, in\nlinear-time, for all graph classes that can be modularly decomposed into\ncycles. Our work is the first to explain why the existence of some nice\nordering over the modules of a graph, instead of just over its vertices, can\nhelp to speed up the computation of maximum matchings on some graph classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 07:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

Herein, the self-consistent scheme accurately predicts both bulk\nand shear moduli, with no adjustable parameter, provided the porosity is less\nthan 35%, for layers composed of particles as small as 15 nm in diameter.\nConversely, Kendall's approach is found to predict the Young's modulus over the\nfull porosity range.

But in order for this to work, an\nexternal magnetic field ${\\bf B}$ must be present. In several cases ${\\bf B}$\nis modeled as a domain-like network with `sharp edges': all domains have the\nsame size $L_{\\rm dom}$ (set by the ${\\bf B}$ coherence length) and the same\nstrength B, but the direction of ${\\bf B}$ changes randomly and abruptly from\none domain to the next. It is obviously a highly mathematical idealization\nwherein the components of ${\\bf B}$ are discontinuous across the edges (whence\nthe name sharp edges). It is therefore highly desirable to go a step further,\nand to find out what happens when the edges are smoothed out, namely when the\nabrupt change of ${\\bf B}$ is replaced by a smooth one. Moreover, this step\nbecomes compelling when the photon-ALP oscillation length $l_{\\rm osc}$ turns\nout to be comparable to -- or smaller than -- $L_{\\rm dom}$, because in this\ncase the photon survival probability $P_{\\gamma \\to \\gamma} ({\\cal E})$\ncritically depends on the domain shape. In the present paper we propose a\nsmoothed out version of the previous domain-like structure of ${\\bf B}$ which\nincorporates the above changes, and we work out its implications.

However, most\nknowledge about atmospheric dynamics has been obtained with cloud-tracking\ntechnique, which consists of tracking visible features from images taken at\ndifferent dates. Doppler imaging is as challenging - motions can be less than\n100 m/s - as appealing because it measures the speed of cloud particles instead\nof large cloud structures. Significant difference is expected in case of\natmospheric waves interfering with cloud structures. The purpose of this paper\nis to provide a theoretical basis for conducting accurate Doppler measurements\nof planetary atmospheres, especially from the ground with reflected solar\nabsorption lines. We focus on three aspects which lead to significant biases.\nFirstly, we fully review the Young effect, which is an artificial radial\nvelocity field caused by the solar rotation that mimics a retrograde planetary\nrotation. Secondly, we extensively study the impact of atmospheric seeing and\nshow that it modifies the apparent location of the planet in the sky whenever\nthe planet is not observed at full phase (opposition). Besides, the seeing\nconvolves regions of variable radial velocity and photometry, which biases\nradial-velocity measurements, by reducing the apparent amplitude of atmospheric\nmotions. Finally, we propose a method to interpret data, i.e., how to retrieve\nzonal, meridional, vertical, and subsolar-to-antisolar circulation from radial\nvelocity maps, by optimizing the signal to noise ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 09:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 09:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

Mimicking the same behavior on\nmachine learning vision systems is an interesting and very challenging research\nproblem with many practical advantages on real world vision applications. In\nthis context, the goal of our work is to devise a few-shot visual learning\nsystem that during test time it will be able to efficiently learn novel\ncategories from only a few training data while at the same time it will not\nforget the initial categories on which it was trained (here called base\ncategories). To achieve that goal we propose (a) to extend an object\nrecognition system with an attention based few-shot classification weight\ngenerator, and (b) to redesign the classifier of a ConvNet model as the cosine\nsimilarity function between feature representations and classification weight\nvectors. The latter, apart from unifying the recognition of both novel and base\ncategories, it also leads to feature representations that generalize better on\n\"unseen\" categories. We extensively evaluate our approach on Mini-ImageNet\nwhere we manage to improve the prior state-of-the-art on few-shot recognition\n(i.e., we achieve 56.20% and 73.00% on the 1-shot and 5-shot settings\nrespectively) while at the same time we do not sacrifice any accuracy on the\nbase categories, which is a characteristic that most prior approaches lack.\nFinally, we apply our approach on the recently introduced few-shot benchmark of\nBharath and Girshick [4] where we also achieve state-of-the-art results. The\ncode and models of our paper will be published on:\nhttps://github.com/gidariss/FewShotWithoutForgetting\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 09:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

Previous approaches train detection models with\nentire images all at once, making the models prone to being trapped in\nsub-optimums due to the introduced false positive examples. Unlike them, we\npropose a zigzag learning strategy to simultaneously discover reliable object\ninstances and prevent the model from overfitting initial seeds. Towards this\ngoal, we first develop a criterion named mean Energy Accumulation Scores (mEAS)\nto automatically measure and rank localization difficulty of an image\ncontaining the target object, and accordingly learn the detector progressively\nby feeding examples with increasing difficulty. In this way, the model can be\nwell prepared by training on easy examples for learning from more difficult\nones and thus gain a stronger detection ability more efficiently. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a novel masking regularization strategy over the high level\nconvolutional feature maps to avoid overfitting initial samples. These two\nmodules formulate a zigzag learning process, where progressive learning\nendeavors to discover reliable object instances, and masking regularization\nincreases the difficulty of finding object instances properly. We achieve 47.6%\nmAP on PASCAL VOC 2007, surpassing the state-of-the-arts by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 10:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

The various proxies of solar\nactivity from various observatory including the sunspot area records of\nKodaikanal Observatory have been analyzed to study the irregular aspects of\nsolar cycles and an analysis has been carried out on the correlation between\nthe decay rate and the next cycle amplitude. Theoretical analysis starts with\nexplaining how the magnetic buoyancy has been treated in the flux transport\ndynamo models, and advantages and disadvantages of different treatments. It is\nfound that some of the irregular properties of the solar cycle in the decaying\nphase can only be well explained using a particular treatment of the magnetic\nbuoyancy. Next, the behavior of the dynamo with different spatial structures of\nthe meridional flow based on recent helioseismology results has been studied. A\ntheoretical model is constructed considering the back reaction due to the\nLorentz force on the meridional flows which explains the observed variation of\nthe meridional flow with the solar cycle. Finally, some results with 3D FTD\nmodels are presented. This 3D model is developed to handle the Babcock-Leighton\nmechanism and magnetic buoyancy more realistically than previous 2D models and\ncan capture some important effects connected with the subduction of the\nmagnetic field in polar regions, which are missed in 2D surface flux transport\nmodels.

The initial hypothesis is that databases that rely on journal selection\ncriteria for their document coverage may not necessarily provide an accurate\nrepresentation of highly-cited documents across all subject areas, while\ninclusive databases, which give each document the chance to stand on its own\nmerits, might be better suited to identify highly-cited documents. To test this\nhypothesis, an analysis of 2,515 highly-cited documents published in 2006 that\nGoogle Scholar displays in its Classic Papers product is carried out at the\nlevel of broad subject categories, checking whether these documents are also\ncovered in Web of Science and Scopus, and whether the citation counts offered\nby the different sources are similar. The results show that a large fraction of\nhighly-cited documents in the Social Sciences and Humanities (8.6%-28.2%) are\ninvisible to Web of Science and Scopus. In the Natural, Life, and Health\nSciences the proportion of missing highly-cited documents in Web of Science and\nScopus is much lower. Furthermore, in all areas, Spearman correlation\ncoefficients of citation counts in Google Scholar, as compared to Web of\nScience and Scopus citation counts, are remarkably strong (.83-.99). The main\nconclusion is that the data about highly-cited documents available in the\ninclusive database Google Scholar does indeed reveal significant coverage\ndeficiencies in Web of Science and Scopus in several areas of research.\nTherefore, using these selective databases to compute bibliometric indicators\nbased on counts of highly-cited documents might produce biased assessments in\npoorly covered areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 11:04:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 12:45:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 16:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

In this paper we propose a completely different\nstrategy. We address the problem of geometrically complex free surface boundary\nconditions with a novel diffuse interface method on adaptive Cartesian meshes\nthat consists in the introduction of a characteristic function $\n0\\leq\\alpha\\leq 1$ which identifies the location of the solid medium and the\nsurrounding air and thus implicitly defines the location of the free surface\nboundary. Our new approach completely avoids the problem of mesh generation,\nsince all that is needed for the definition of the complex surface topography\nis to set a scalar color function to unity inside the regions covered by the\nsolid and to zero outside. An analysis of the eigenvalues of the PDE system\nshows that the complexity of the geometry has no influence on the admissible\ntime step size due to the CFL condition. The model reduces to the classical\nlinear elasticity equations inside the solid medium where the gradients of\n$\\alpha$ are zero, while in the diffuse interface zone at the free surface\nboundary the governing PDE system becomes nonlinear. We can prove that the\nsolution of the Riemann problem with arbitrary data and a jump in $\\alpha$ from\nunity to zero yields a Godunov-state at the interface that satisfies the\nfree-surface boundary condition exactly.

To solve the problem, this paper\nproposes a novel feature matching algorithm that is robust to large NRD. The\nproposed method is called radiation-invariant feature transform (RIFT). There\nare three main contributions in RIFT: first, RIFT uses phase congruency (PC)\ninstead of image intensity for feature point detection. RIFT considers both the\nnumber and repeatability of feature points, and detects both corner points and\nedge points on the PC map. Second, RIFT originally proposes a maximum index map\n(MIM) for feature description. MIM is constructed from the log-Gabor\nconvolution sequence and is much more robust to NRD than traditional gradient\nmap. Thus, RIFT not only largely improves the stability of feature detection,\nbut also overcomes the limitation of gradient information for feature\ndescription. Third, RIFT analyzes the inherent influence of rotations on the\nvalues of MIM, and realizes rotation invariance. We use six different types of\nmulti-model image datasets to evaluate RIFT, including optical-optical,\ninfrared-optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-optical, depth-optical,\nmap-optical, and day-night datasets. Experimental results show that RIFT is\nmuch more superior to SIFT and SAR-SIFT.

The scheme used for distributing the input tensor among the processors\n(MPI ranks) critically influences the HOOI execution time. Prior work has\nproposed different distribution schemes: an offline scheme based on\nsophisticated hypergraph partitioning method and simple, lightweight\nalternatives that can be used real-time. While the hypergraph based scheme\ntypically results in faster HOOI execution time, being complex, the time taken\nfor determining the distribution is an order of magnitude higher than the\nexecution time of a single HOOI iteration. Our main contribution is a\nlightweight distribution scheme, which achieves the best of both worlds. We\nshow that the scheme is near-optimal on certain fundamental metrics associated\nwith the HOOI procedure and as a result, near-optimal on the computational load\n(FLOPs).

The approach is to understand\nsecond-order set theory by studying the structure of models of second-order set\ntheories. The main results are the following, organized by chapter. First, I\ninvestigate the poset of $T$-realizations of a fixed countable model of\n$\\mathsf{ZFC}$, where $T$ is a reasonable second-order set theory such as\n$\\mathsf{GBC}$ or $\\mathsf{KM}$, showing that it has a rich structure. In\nparticular, every countable partial order embeds into this structure. Moreover,\nwe can arrange so that these embedding preserve the existence/nonexistence of\nupper bounds, at least for finite partial orders. Second I generalize some\nconstructions of Marek and Mostowski from $\\mathsf{KM}$ to weaker theories.\nThey showed that every model of $\\mathsf{KM}$ plus the Class Collection schema\n\"unrolls\" to a model of $\\mathsf{ZFC}^-$ with a largest cardinal. I calculate\nthe theories of the unrolling for a variety of second-order set theories, going\nas weak as $\\mathsf{GBC} + \\mathsf{ETR}$. I also show that being $T$-realizable\ngoes down to submodels for a broad selection of second-order set theories $T$.\nThird, I show that there is a hierarchy of transfinite recursion principles\nranging in strength from $\\mathsf{GBC}$ to $\\mathsf{KM}$. This hierarchy is\nordered first by the complexity of the properties allowed in the recursions and\nsecond by the allowed heights of the recursions. Fourth, I investigate the\nquestion of which second-order set theories have least models. I show that\nstrong theories---such as $\\mathsf{KM}$ or $\\Pi^1_1\\text{-}\\mathsf{CA}$---do\nnot have least transitive models while weaker theories---from $\\mathsf{GBC}$ to\n$\\mathsf{GBC} + \\mathsf{ETR}_\\mathrm{Ord}$---do have least transitive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 13:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

Traditional methods use standard all-to-all collective\ncommunication of contiguous memory buffers, thus necessary requiring local data\nrealignment steps intermixed in-between redistribution and transform steps.\nInstead, our method takes advantage of subarray datatypes and generalized\nall-to-all scatter/gather from the MPI-2 standard to communicate discontiguous\nmemory buffers, effectively eliminating the need for local data realignments.\nDespite generalized all-to-all communication of discontiguous data being\ngenerally slower, our proposal economizes in local work. For a range of strong\nand weak scaling tests, we found the overall performance of our method to be on\npar and often better than well-established libraries like MPI-FFTW, P3DFFT, and\n2DECOMP&FFT. We provide compact routines implemented at the highest possible\nlevel using the MPI bindings for the C programming language.

In addition to facilitating the computationally\nintensive task of processing 3D point clouds, working at the level of segments\naddresses the data compression requirements of real-time single- and\nmulti-robot systems. While current methods extract descriptors for the single\ntask of localization, SegMap leverages a data-driven descriptor in order to\nextract meaningful features that can also be used for reconstructing a dense 3D\nmap of the environment and for extracting semantic information.

With the proliferation of\nwireless devices, it is important to understand how radio frequency\ninterference (RFI) can impact on pervasive computing applications. In this\npaper, we investigate the impact of RFI on device-free CSI-based\nlocation-oriented activity recognition. We present data to show that RFI can\nhave a significant impact on the CSI vectors. In the absence of RFI, different\nactivities give rise to different CSI vectors that can be differentiated\nvisually. However, in the presence of RFI, the CSI vectors become much noisier\nand activity recognition also becomes harder.

This has potential as a tool for trial\ndesign; the cost and value of different designs could be compared to find the\ntrial with the greatest net benefit. However, despite recent developments, EVSI\nanalysis can be slow especially when optimising over a large number of\ndifferent designs. Methods: This paper develops a method to reduce the\ncomputation time required to calculate the EVSI across different sample sizes.\nOur method extends the moment matching approach to EVSI estimation to optimise\nover different sample sizes for the underlying trial with a similar\ncomputational cost to a single EVSI estimate.

We extend those results to\nnondifferentiable regularisers on uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach\nspaces. This gives a (more) complete answer to the question when there is a\nrepresenter theorem. We then note that for regularised interpolation in fact\nthe solution is determined by the function space alone and independent of the\nregulariser, making the extension to Banach spaces even more valuable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 14:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-26"}

These spectra are\ndesigned to interpolate between the upper box-counting and Assouad dimensions.\nIt is known that the Assouad spectrum approaches the upper box-counting\ndimension at the left hand side of its domain, but does not necessarily\napproach the Assouad dimension on the right. Here we show that it necessarily\napproaches the \\emph{quasi-Assouad dimension} at the right hand side of its\ndomain. We further show that the upper Assouad spectrum can be expressed in\nterms of the Assouad spectrum, thus motivating the definition used by\nFraser-Yu.\n  We also provide a large family of examples demonstrating new phenomena\nrelating to the form of the Assouad spectrum.

The two challenge editions in 2015\nand 2017 involved the assessment of spoofing countermeasures (CMs) in isolation\nfrom ASV using an equal error rate (EER) metric. While a strategic approach to\nassessment at the time, it has certain shortcomings. First, the CM EER is not\nnecessarily a reliable predictor of performance when ASV and CMs are combined.\nSecond, the EER operating point is ill-suited to user authentication\napplications, e.g. telephone banking, characterised by a high target user prior\nbut a low spoofing attack prior. We aim to migrate from CM- to ASV-centric\nassessment with the aid of a new tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) metric.\nIt extends the conventional DCF used in ASV research to scenarios involving\nspoofing attacks. The t-DCF metric has 6 parameters: (i) false alarm and miss\ncosts for both systems, and (ii) prior probabilities of target and spoof trials\n(with an implied third, nontarget prior). The study is intended to serve as a\nself-contained, tutorial-like presentation. We analyse with the t-DCF a\nselection of top-performing CM submissions to the 2015 and 2017 editions of\nASVspoof, with a focus on the spoofing attack prior. Whereas there is little to\nchoose between countermeasure systems for lower priors, system rankings derived\nwith the EER and t-DCF show differences for higher priors.

Many real-world applications are\ndynamic in nature and so are their data. To deal with this dynamic nature of\ndata, there exist a variety of online tensor decomposition algorithms. A\ncentral assumption in all those algorithms is that the number of latent\nconcepts remains fixed throughout the entire stream. However, this need not be\nthe case. Every incoming batch in the stream may have a different number of\nlatent concepts, and the difference in latent concepts from one tensor batch to\nanother can provide insights into how our findings in a particular application\nbehave and deviate over time. In this paper, we define \"concept\" and \"concept\ndrift\" in the context of streaming tensor decomposition, as the manifestation\nof the variability of latent concepts throughout the stream. Furthermore, we\nintroduce SeekAndDestroy, an algorithm that detects concept drift in streaming\ntensor decomposition and is able to produce results robust to that drift. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates concept\ndrift in streaming tensor decomposition. We extensively evaluate SeekAndDestroy\non synthetic datasets, which exhibit a wide variety of realistic drift. Our\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SeekAndDestroy, both in the\ndetection of concept drift and in the alleviation of its effects, producing\nresults with similar quality to decomposing the entire tensor in one shot.\nAdditionally, in real datasets, SeekAndDestroy outperforms other streaming\nbaselines, while discovering novel useful components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 15:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2018 01:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

Negative Capacitance (NC) in ferroelectric materials is\nproposed in order to address this physical limitation of CMOS technology. A\npolarization destabilization in ferroelectrics causes an effective negative\npermittivity, resulting in a differential voltage amplification and a reduced\nsubthreshold swing when integrated into the gate stack of a transistor. Recent\ndemonstrations of negative capacitance concerned mainly n-type MOSFETs and\ntheir subthreshold slope. An effective technology booster should be capable of\nimproving the performance of both n- and p-type transistors.

Direct\nvisualisation of the stray field surrounding the probe apex using electron\nholography convincingly demonstrates a striking difference in the spatial\ndistribution and strength of the magnetic flux in FM and A-FM states.

We use a flexible approach in which\nno a priori assignment of an electrical nature to the circuit branches is\nnecessary. Such an assignment is eventually done just by setting certain model\nparameters, in a way which avoids the need for a distinction between voltage\nand current sources and, additionally, makes it possible to get rid of voltage-\nor current-control assumptions on the impedances. This paves the way for a\ncompletely general $m$-dimensional reduction of any circuit defined by $m$\ntwo-terminal, uncoupled linear elements, contrary to most classical methods\nwhich at one step or another impose certain restrictions on the allowed\ndevices. The reduction has the form $$\\begin{pmatrix} AP \\\\ BQ \\end{pmatrix} u\n= \\begin{pmatrix} AQ \\\\ -BP \\end{pmatrix} \\bar{s}.$$ Here, $A$ and $B$ capture\nthe graph topology, whereas $P$, $Q$, $\\bar{s}$ comprise homogeneous\ndescriptions of all the circuit elements; the unknown $u$ is an $m$-dimensional\nvector of (say) ``seed'' variables from which currents and voltages are\nobtained as $i=Pu -Q\\bar{s}$, $v=Qu + P\\bar{s}$.

And, (ii) why do they\nsuccessfully predict under-resolved turbulent flows even without a\nsubgrid-scale model? The answer to these two questions can in turn provide\ncrucial guidelines to construct more robust and accurate schemes for complex\nunder-resolved flows, commonly found in industrial applications. For\nillustration purposes, this analysis technique is applied to the hybridized\ndiscontinuous Galerkin methods as representatives of spectral element methods.\nThe effect of the polynomial order, the upwinding parameter and the P\\'eclet\nnumber on the so-called \\textit{short-term diffusion} of the scheme are\ninvestigated. From a purely non-modal analysis point of view, polynomial orders\nbetween $2$ and $4$ with standard upwinding are well suited for under-resolved\nturbulence simulations. For lower polynomial orders, diffusion is introduced in\nscales that are much larger than the grid resolution. For higher polynomial\norders, as well as for strong under/over-upwinding, robustness issues can be\nexpected. The non-modal analysis results are then tested against under-resolved\nturbulence simulations of the Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. While\ndevised in the linear setting, our non-modal analysis succeeds to predict the\nbehavior of the scheme in the nonlinear problems considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 00:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In this\npaper, we adopt a new approach toward thermodynamic phase space and\nsuccessfully explore the critical behaviour of $(n+1)$-dimensional Lifshitz\ndilaton black holes. For this purpose, we write down the equation of state as\n$Q^s=Q^s(T,\\Psi)$ with $\\Psi=\\left({\\partial M}/{\\partial Q^{s} }\\right)_{S,P}$\nis the conjugate of $Q^s$ and construct Smarr relation based on this new phase\nspace as $ M=M(S,Q^{s},P)$, where $s=2p/(2p-1)$ with $p$ is the power of the\npower-law Maxwell Lagrangian. We justify such a choice mathematically and show\nthat with this new phase space, the system admits the critical behaviour and\nresembles the Van der Waals fluid system when the cosmological constant\n(pressure) is treated as a fixed parameter, while the charge of the system\nvaries. We obtain Gibbs free energy of the system and find swallow tail shape\nin Gibbs diagrams which represents the first order phase transition.

The study examines the practical implications of estimating individual\nscores in a paper-and-pencil high-stakes test using 2PL and 3PL models,\nspecifically whether the principle of consistent order holds when scoring with\nIRT. The principle states that student A, who answers the same (or a larger)\nnumber of items of greater difficulty than student B, should outscore B.\nResults of analyses conducted using actual scores from the Chilean national\nadmission test in mathematics indicate the principle does not hold when scoring\nwith 2PL or 3PL models. Students who answer more items and of greater\ndifficulty may be assigned lower scores. The findings can be explained by\nexamining the mathematical models, since estimated ability scores are an\nincreasing function of the accumulated estimated discriminations for the\ncorrect items, not their difficulty. For high stakes tests the decision to use\ncomplex model should therefore be a matter of serious deliberation for policy\nmakers and test experts, since fairness and transparency may be compromised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 21:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

Along the way, the project could generate important\nsupplementary benefits to solar system exploration. A number of hard\nengineering challenges remain to be solved before these missions can become a\nreality.\n  A system model has been formulated as part of the Starshot systems\nengineering work. This paper presents the model and describes how it computes\ncost-optimal point designs. Three point designs are computed: A 0.2 c mission\nto Alpha Centauri, a 0.01 c solar system precursor mission, and a ground-based\ntest facility based on a vacuum tunnel. All assume that the photon pressure\nfrom a 1.06 {\\mu}m wavelength beam accelerates a circular dielectric sail. The\n0.2 c point design assumes \\$0.01/W lasers, \\$500/m$^2$ optics, and \\$50/kWh\nenergy storage to achieve \\$8.0B capital cost for the ground-based beam\ndirector. In contrast, the energy needed to accelerate each sail costs \\$6M.\nBeam director capital cost is minimized by a 4.1 m diameter sail that is\naccelerated for 9 min. The 0.01 c point design assumes \\$1/W lasers,\n\\$10k/m$^2$ optics, and \\$100/kWh energy storage to achieve \\$517M capital cost\nfor the beam director and \\$8k energy cost to accelerate each 19 cm diameter\nsail. The ground-based test facility assumes \\$100/W lasers, \\$1M/m$^2$ optics,\n\\$500/kWh energy storage, and \\$10k/m vacuum tunnel. To reach 20 km/s, fast\nenough to escape the solar system from Earth, takes 0.4 km of vacuum tunnel, 22\nkW of lasers, and a 0.6 m diameter telescope, all of which costs \\$5M.\n  The system model predicts that, ultimately, Starshot can scale to propel\nprobes faster than 0.9 c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 23:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 22:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 09:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}
