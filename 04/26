As major driving force of the disk wind we disentangle the toroidal\nmagnetic field pressure gradient, however,magneto-centrifugal driving may also\ncontribute. Black hole rotation in our simulations suppresses the accretion\nrate due to an enhanced toroidal magnetic field pressure that seems to be\ninduced by frame-dragging.

These techniques are based\non the fact that the ASR amplitude can be suppressed by a pre-stimulus of\nlower, non-startling intensity, an effect named pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). For\nhearing threshold estimation, pure tone pre-stimuli of varying amplitudes are\npresented before an intense noise burst serving as startle stimulus. The amount\nof suppression of the ASR amplitude as a function of the pre-stimulus intensity\ncan be used as a behavioral correlate to determine the hearing ability. For\ntinnitus assessment, the pure-tone pre-stimulus is replaced by a gap of silence\nin a narrowband noise background, a paradigm termed GPIAS (gap-pre-pulse\ninhibition of the acoustic startle response). A proper application of these\nparadigms depend on a reliable measurement of the ASR amplitudes, an exact\nstimulus presentation in terms of frequency and intensity.

Second, the non-Euclidean nature of the angle variable reveals the\ngeometry of a suitable target set, which is compact and attractive for the zero\ndynamics. On this set, circuit-theoretic aspects come into play, giving rise to\na network potential function which relates the electrical circuit variables to\nthe machine rotor angles.

The\nposterior surface of the modes is convex in the linear regime, leading to a\nunique global maximum (MAP), but this is no longer guaranteed in the nonlinear\nregime. In this paper we investigate the nature of posterior surface using the\nrecently developed MAP reconstruction method, with a simplified but realistic\nN-body simulation as the forward model. The reconstruction method uses\noptimization with analytic gradients from back-propagation through the\nsimulation. For low noise cases we recover the initial conditions well into the\nnonlinear regime ($k\\sim 1$ h/Mpc) nearly perfectly. We show that the large\nscale modes can be recovered more precisely than the linear expectation, which\nwe argue is a consequence of nonlinear mode coupling. For noise levels\nachievable with current and planned LSS surveys the reconstruction cannot\nrecover very small scales due to noise. We see some evidence of non-convexity,\nspecially for smaller scales where the non-injective nature of the mappings:\nseveral very different initial conditions leading to the same near perfect\nfinal data reconstruction.

For this setup, we characterize two performance\nmetrics: (i) energy coverage and (ii) joint signal-to-interference-plus-noise\n(SINR) and energy coverage. The analysis is performed using a realistic spatial\nmodel that captures the spatial coupling between the locations of the IoT\ndevices and the nodes of the wireless network (referred henceforth as the IoT\ngateways), which is often ignored in the literature.

The\nlevel of coupling can be controlled by tuning the fraction of total GWs that\nare deployed at the cluster centers.

For six-dimensional SCFTs such\na role is played by the BPS strings on the tensorial Coulomb branch. In this\npaper we develop a uniform description of the worldsheet theories of a BPS\nstring for rank-one 6d SCFTs. These strings are the basic constituents of the\nBPS string spectrum of arbitrary rank six-dimensional models, which they\ngenerate by forming bound states. Motivated by geometric engineering in\nF-theory, we describe the worldsheet theories of the BPS strings in terms of\ntopologically twisted 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories in the presence of $1/2$-BPS\n2d $(0,4)$ defects. As the superconformal point of a 6d theory with gauge group\n$G$ is approached, the resulting worldsheet theory flows to an\n$\\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ NLSM with target the moduli space of one $G$ instanton,\ntogether with a nontrivial left moving bundle characterized by the matter\ncontent of the six-dimensional model. We compute the anomaly polynomial and\ncentral charges of the NLSM, and argue that the 6d flavor symmetry $F$ is\nrealized as a current algebra on the string, whose level we compute. We find\nevidence that for generic theories the $G$ dependence is captured at the level\nof the elliptic genus by characters of an affine Kac-Moody algebra at negative\nlevel, which we interpret as a subsector of the chiral algebra of the BPS\nstring worldsheet theory. We also find evidence for a spectral flow relating\nthe R-R and NS-R elliptic genera. These properties of the string CFTs lead to\nconstraints on their spectra, which in combination with modularity allow us to\ndetermine the elliptic genera of a vast number of string CFTs, leading also to\nnovel results for 6d and 5d instanton partition functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 17:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 09:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2018 14:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Performing these tasks repeatedly requires a system in\nwhich measurement and feedback decision times are short compared to qubit\ncoherence times, where the measurement reproduces faithfully the desired\nprojection, and for which the measurement process has no detrimental effect on\nthe ability to perform further operations.

To this end, a powerful tool would be a framework for unsupervised\nlearning, where the machine learns the intricate high-dimensional contours of\nthe data upon which it is trained, without reference to pre-established labels.\nIn order to approach such a complex task, an unsupervised network must be\nstructured intelligently, based on a qualitative understanding of the data. In\nthis paper, we scaffold the neural network's architecture around a\nleading-order model of the physics underlying the data. In addition to making\nunsupervised learning tractable, this design actually alleviates existing\ntensions between performance and interpretability. We call the framework\nJUNIPR: \"Jets from UNsupervised Interpretable PRobabilistic models\". In this\napproach, the set of particle momenta composing a jet are clustered into a\nbinary tree that the neural network examines sequentially. Training is\nunsupervised and unrestricted: the network could decide that the data bears\nlittle correspondence to the chosen tree structure. However, when there is a\ncorrespondence, the network's output along the tree has a direct physical\ninterpretation. JUNIPR models can perform discrimination tasks, through the\nstatistically optimal likelihood-ratio test, and they permit visualizations of\ndiscrimination power at each branching in a jet's tree. Additionally, JUNIPR\nmodels provide a probability distribution from which events can be drawn,\nproviding a data-driven Monte Carlo generator. As a third application, JUNIPR\nmodels can reweight events from one (e.g. simulated) data set to agree with\ndistributions from another (e.g. experimental) data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Using the replica trick to handle the\nlogarithm in the definition of the $n$th R\\'enyi entropy $S_n$, we map the\ncalculation of the entanglement after a quench to a problem of interacting\nrandom walks. A key role is played by effective classical spins (taking values\nin a permutation group) which distinguish between different ways of pairing\nspacetime histories in the replicated system. For the second R\\'enyi entropy,\n$S_2$, we are able to take the replica limit explicitly.

This ever increasing number of recorded neurons opens up the possibility\nto address new questions and extract higher dimensional stimuli from the\nrecordings. Modeling neural spike trains as point processes, this task of\nextracting dynamical signals from spike trains is commonly set in the context\nof nonlinear filtering theory. Particle filter methods relying on importance\nweights are generic algorithms that solve the filtering task numerically, but\nexhibit a serious drawback when the problem dimensionality is high: they are\nknown to suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' (COD), i.e. the number of\nparticles required for a certain performance scales exponentially with the\nobservable dimensions. Here, we first briefly review the theory on filtering\nwith point process observations in continuous time. Based on this theory, we\ninvestigate both analytically and numerically the reason for the COD of\nweighted particle filtering approaches: Similarly to particle filtering with\ncontinuous-time observations, the COD with point-process observations is due to\nthe decay of effective number of particles, an effect that is stronger when the\nnumber of observable dimensions increases. Given the success of unweighted\nparticle filtering approaches in overcoming the COD for continuous- time\nobservations, we introduce an unweighted particle filter for point-process\nobservations, the spike-based Neural Particle Filter (sNPF), and show that it\nexhibits a similar favorable scaling as the number of dimensions grows.\nFurther, we derive rules for the parameters of the sNPF from a maximum\nlikelihood approach learning.

Later, it was extended to the\nblack-oil model, whereby the gas component is allowed to dissolve in the oil\nphase. Most recently, the SFI approach was extended to fully compositional\nisothermal displacements. SFI schemes solve the fully coupled system in two\nsteps: (1) Construct and solve the pressure equation (flow problem). (2) Solve\nthe coupled species transport equations for the phase saturations and phase\ncompositions. Experience indicates that complex interphase mass transfer\nbehaviors often lead to large numbers of SFI outer iterations compared with the\nFully Implicit (FI) method. Here, we demonstrate that the convergence\ndifficulties are directly related to the treatment of the coupling between the\nflow and transport problems, and we propose a new SFI variant based on a\nnonlinear overall-volume balance equation. The first step consists of forming\nand solving a nonlinear pressure equation, which is a weighted sum of all the\ncomponent mass conservation equations.

We analyze the `splitting errors' associated\nwith the compositional SFI scheme, and we show how to control these errors in\norder to converge to the same solution as the Fully Implicit (FI) method.

The contribution also describes a simplified\ncalculation of the spacetime sector model that students can carry out on their\nown, if they are familiar with the Minkowski metric. The teaching materials\npresented in this paper are available online for teaching purposes at\nhttp://www.spacetimetravel.org .\n  -----\n  Sektormodelle erm\\\"oglichen einen modellbasierten Zugang zur Allgemeinen\nRelativit\\\"atstheorie, der auf das Verst\\\"andnis der geometrischen Konzepte\nabzielt und in seinen mathematischen Anforderungen nicht \\\"uber Schulmathematik\nhinausgeht.

Experiments show that the gripper\nallows for more accurate and faster picking of strawberries compared to\nexisting systems. The gripper consists of four functional parts for sensing,\npicking, transmission, and storing. It has six fingers that open to form a\nclosed space to swallow a target strawberry and push other surrounding berries\naway from the target. Equipped with three IR sensors, the gripper controls a\nmanipulator arm to correct for positional error, and can thus pick strawberries\nthat are not exactly localized by the vision algorithm, improving the\nrobustness. Experiments show that the gripper is gentle on the berries as it\nmerely cuts the stem and there is no physical interaction with the berries\nduring the cutting process. We show that the gripper has close-to-perfect\nsuccessful picking rate when addressing isolated strawberries. By including\ninternal perception, we get high positional error tolerance, and avoid using\nslow, high-level closed-loop control. Moreover, the gripper can store several\nberries, which reduces the overall travel distance for the manipulator, and\ndecreases the time needed to pick a single strawberry substantially. The\nexperiments show that the gripper design decreased picking execution time\nnoticeably compared to results found in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 19:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

The parties\nare promised that the interleaved product $a_{11}\\dots a_{k1}a_{12}\\dots\na_{k2}\\dots a_{1t}\\dots a_{kt}$ is equal either to the identity $e$ or to some\nother fixed element $g\\in G$, and their goal is to determine which of the two\nthe product is equal to. We show that for all fixed $k$ and all sufficiently\nlarge $t$ the communication is $\\Omega(t \\log |G|)$, which is tight. Even for\n$k=2$ the previous best lower bound was $\\Omega(t)$. As an application, we\nestablish the security of the leakage-resilient circuits studied by Miles and\nViola in the \"only computation leaks\" model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 20:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

It is\nwell known that the solutions of K-means can be arbitrarily distant from the\ntrue MSSC global optimum, and dozens of alternative heuristics have been\nproposed for this problem. However, no other algorithm has been predominantly\nadopted in the literature. This may be related to differences of computational\neffort, or to the assumption that a near-optimal solution of the MSSC has only\na marginal impact on clustering validity. In this article, we dispute this\nbelief. We introduce an efficient population-based metaheuristic that uses\nK-means as a local search in combination with problem-tailored crossover,\nmutation, and diversification operators. This algorithm can be interpreted as a\nmulti-start K-means, in which the initial center positions are carefully\nsampled based on the search history. The approach is scalable and accurate,\noutperforming all recent state-of-the-art algorithms for MSSC in terms of\nsolution quality, measured by the depth of local minima. This enhanced accuracy\nleads to clusters which are significantly closer to the ground truth than those\nof other algorithms, for overlapping Gaussian-mixture datasets with a large\nnumber of features.

At the\ncosmological level, we explore the stability of the electric and magnetic\nattractor solutions, both within and beyond the perturbation theory, and find\nthat thanks to these latter the cancellation between the electric and the\nmagnetic vacua components is achieved at macroscopic space and time\nseparations. This implies the disappearance of the conformal anomaly in the\nclassical limit of an effective Yang-Mills theory. In this picture, the\ntunneling probability from the Mirror vacua to the other vacua is exponentially\nsuppressed in the quantum non-thermal state --- similarly to what happens for\nelectroweak instantonic tunneling solutions. Specifically, we show that, in a\ndynamical Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological background,\nthe Nielsen-Olsen argument --- on the instability of uniform chromo-electric\nand chromo-magnetic Mirror vacua --- is subtly violated. The chromo-magnetic\nand chromo-electric uniform vacua are unstable only at asymptotic times, when\nthe attractor to a zero energy density is already reached. The two vacua can\nsafely decay into one anisotropic vacuum that has zero energy-density. We also\ndiscover a new surprising pattern of solitonic and anti-solitonic space-like\nsolutions, which are sourced by the Yang-Mills dynamics in FLRW. We dub such\nnon-perturbative configurations, which are directly related to dynamical\ncancellation mechanism of the vacuum energy, as {\\it chronons}, or\n$\\chi$-solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 22:45:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 23:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 10:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

This ambitious mission has strict requirements on residual\nsystematic errors resulting from instrumental corrections in order to meet a\ndesign goal of sub-10 microarcsecond astrometry. During the design and build\nphase of the science instruments, various critical calibrations were studied in\ndetail to ensure that this goal could be met in orbit. In particular, it was\ndetermined that the video-chain offsets on the analogue side of the\nanalogue-to-digital conversion electronics exhibited instabilities that could\nnot be mitigated fully by modifications to the flight hardware. We provide a\ndetailed description of the behaviour of the electronic offset levels on\nmicrosecond timescales, identifying various systematic effects that are known\ncollectively as offset non-uniformities. The effects manifest themselves as\ntransient perturbations on the gross zero-point electronic offset level that is\nroutinely monitored as part of the overall calibration process. Using in-orbit\nspecial calibration sequences along with simple parametric models, we show how\nthe effects can be calibrated, and how these calibrations are applied to the\nscience data. While the calibration part of the process is relatively\nstraightforward, the application of the calibrations during science data\nprocessing requires a detailed on-ground reconstruction of the readout timing\nof each charge-coupled device (CCD) sample on each device in order to predict\ncorrectly the highly time-dependent nature of the corrections. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our offset non-uniformity models in mitigating the effects\nin Gaia data.

Many pruning schemes have been proposed, but\nthese have mainly focused on the number of pruned weights. Previous pruning\nschemes scarcely considered ASIC or FPGA accelerator architectures. When these\npruned networks are run on accelerators, the lack of consideration of the\narchitecture causes some inefficiency problems, including internal buffer\nmisalignments and load imbalances. This paper proposes a new pruning scheme\nthat reflects accelerator architectures. In the proposed scheme, pruning is\nperformed so that the same number of weights remain for each weight group\ncorresponding to activations fetched simultaneously. In this way, the pruning\nscheme resolves the inefficiency problems, doubling the accelerator\nperformance. Even with this constraint, the proposed pruning scheme reached a\npruning ratio similar to that of previous unconstrained pruning schemes, not\nonly on AlexNet and VGG16 but also on state-of-the-art very deep networks such\nas ResNet. Furthermore, the proposed scheme demonstrated a comparable pruning\nratio on compact networks such as MobileNet and on slimmed networks that were\nalready pruned in a channel-wise manner. In addition to improving the\nefficiency of previous sparse accelerators, it will be also shown that the\nproposed pruning scheme can be used to reduce the logic complexity of sparse\naccelerators.The pruned models are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/HyeongjuKang/accelerator-aware-pruning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 02:35:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 12:49:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 07:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

When mutation is not\nsignificant, the two strains segregate and form stripe patterns along the\nchannel. The formed lanes are gradually rearranged, with increasing length\nscales in the two-dimensional cross-sectional plane.

In particular,\nfor the simple model without mutation and killing, we find logarithmically slow\ncoarsening, which is characteristic of the two-dimensional voter model. With\nmutation and killing, we find a phase transition from a monopolistic phase, in\nwhich lanes are formed and coarsened until the system is eventually dominated\nby one of the two strains, to an equally mixed and disordered phase without\nlane structure.

Open information extraction (IE) systems\nmine relation tuples (i.e., entity arguments and a predicate string to describe\ntheir relation) from sentences. These relation tuples are not confined to a\npredefined schema for the relations of interests. However, current Open IE\nsystems focus on modeling local context information in a sentence to extract\nrelation tuples, while ignoring the fact that global statistics in a large\ncorpus can be collectively leveraged to identify high-quality sentence-level\nextractions. In this paper, we propose a novel Open IE system, called ReMine,\nwhich integrates local context signals and global structural signals in a\nunified, distant-supervision framework. Leveraging facts from external\nknowledge bases as supervision, the new system can be applied to many different\ndomains to facilitate sentence-level tuple extractions using corpus-level\nstatistics. Our system operates by solving a joint optimization problem to\nunify (1) segmenting entity/relation phrases in individual sentences based on\nlocal context; and (2) measuring the quality of tuples extracted from\nindividual sentences with a translating-based objective. Learning the two\nsubtasks jointly helps correct errors produced in each subtask so that they can\nmutually enhance each other.

This phenomenon is most easily studied by numerical\nsimulation, using specialized biased-sampling techniques to overcome the\nlimitations imposed by the rarity of nucleation events. Here, I focus on the\nbarrier to homogeneous ice nucleation in supercooled water, as represented by\nthe monatomic-water model, which in the bulk exhibits a complex interplay\nbetween different ice structures. I consider various protocols to identify\nsolidlike particles on a computer, which perform well enough for the\nLennard-Jones model, and compare their respective impact on the shape and\nheight of the nucleation barrier. It turns out that the effect is stronger on\nthe nucleus size than on the barrier height. As a by-product of the analysis, I\ndetermine the structure of the nucleation cluster, finding that the relative\namount of ice phases in the cluster heavily depends on the method used for\nclassifying solidlike particles. Moreover, the phase which is most favored\nduring the earlier stages of crystallization may happen, depending on the\nnucleation coordinate adopted, to be different from the stable polymorph.\nTherefore, the quality of a reaction coordinate cannot be assessed simply on\nthe basis of the barrier height obtained. I explain how this outcome is\npossible and why it just points out the shortcoming of collective variables\nappropriate to simple fluids in providing a robust method of particle\nclassification for monatomic water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 09:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

This is the first time that CI is detected in the\nenvelope around an oxygen-rich M-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. We\nalso confirm the previously tentative CI detection around V Hya, a carbon-rich\nAGB star. As one of the main photodissociation products of parent species in\nthe circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars, CI can be used to trace\nsources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in CSEs. The observed flux density\ntowards omi Cet can be reproduced by a shell with a peak atomic fractional\nabundance of $2.4 \\times 10^{-5}$ predicted based on a simple chemical model\nwhere CO is dissociated by the interstellar radiation field. However, the CI\nemission is shifted by $\\sim$ 4 km/s from the stellar velocity. Based on this\nvelocity shift, we suggest that the detected CI emission towards omi Cet\npotentially arises from a compact region near its hot binary companion. The\nvelocity shift could, therefore, be the result of the orbital velocity of the\nbinary companion around omi Cet. In this case, the CI column density is\nestimated to be $1.1 \\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. This would imply that strong UV\nradiation from the companion and/or accretion of matter between two stars is\nmost likely the origin of the CI enhancement.

We investigate a novel approach to estimate\nthe force vector directly from optical coherence tomography image volumes.\n  \\textit{Methods} We introduce a novel Siamese 3D CNN architecture. The\nnetwork takes an undeformed reference volume and a deformed sample volume as an\ninput and outputs the three components of the force vector.

The geodesic X-ray\ntransform is the generalization of the standard X-ray transform in Riemannian\nmanifolds and is defined by integration of a function along geodesics. This\npaper is motivated by Uhlmann and Vasy's theoretical reconstruction algorithm\nfor geodesic X-ray transform and mathematical formulation for traveltime\ntomography to develop a novel numerical algorithm for the stated goal. Our\nnumerical scheme is based on a Neumann series approximation and a layer\nstripping approach. In particular, we will first reconstruct the unknown\nfunction by using a convergent Neumann series for each small neighborhood near\nthe boundary. Once the solution is constructed on a layer near the boundary, we\nrepeat the same procedure for the next layer, and continue this process until\nthe unknown function is recovered on the whole domain. One main advantage of\nour approach is that the reconstruction is localized, and is therefore very\nefficient, compared with other global approaches for which the reconstructions\nare performed on the whole domain. We illustrate the performance of our method\nby showing some test cases including the Marmousi model.

Abundances of Mg and K were determined\nusing archival VLT FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra, in combination with the 1D NLTE\nspectral synthesis methodology. Spectral line profiles were computed with the\nMULTI code, using ATLAS9 stellar model atmospheres.

No statistically\nsignificant relations between the abundance of K and other light elements were\ndetected. Also, we did not find any significant correlations or\nanti-correlations between the [Mg/Fe] and [K/Fe] ratios and projected distance\nfrom the cluster center.

An atomic splittable routing game is played on a network where\nthe edges have traffic-dependent cost functions, and player strategies\ncorrespond to flows in the network. A player can thus split it's traffic\narbitrarily among different paths. While many properties of equilibria in these\ngames have been studied, efficient algorithms for equilibrium computation are\nknown for only two cases: if cost functions are affine, or if players are\nsymmetric. Neither of these conditions is met in most practical applications.\nWe present two algorithms for routing games with general convex cost functions\non parallel links.

Second, high computational and memory cost hinders their\napplication in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a graph-based\ndistillation framework to address these problems: (1) We propose logits graph\nand representation graph to transfer knowledge from multiple self-supervised\ntasks, where the former distills classifier-level knowledge by solving a\nmulti-distribution joint matching problem, and the latter distills internal\nfeature knowledge from pairwise ensembled representations with tackling the\nchallenge of heterogeneity among different features; (2) The proposal that\nadopts a teacher-student framework can reduce the redundancy of knowledge\nlearnt from teachers dramatically, leading to a lighter student model that\nsolves classification task more efficiently.

SED is typically\nposed as a supervised machine learning problem, requiring strong annotations\nfor the presence or absence of each sound source at every time instant within\nthe recording. However, strong annotations of this type are both labor- and\ncost-intensive for human annotators to produce, which limits the practical\nscalability of SED methods.\n  In this work, we treat SED as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem,\nwhere training labels are static over a short excerpt, indicating the presence\nor absence of sound sources but not their temporal locality. The models,\nhowever, must still produce temporally dynamic predictions, which must be\naggregated (pooled) when comparing against static labels during training. To\nfacilitate this aggregation, we develop a family of adaptive pooling\noperators---referred to as auto-pool---which smoothly interpolate between\ncommon pooling operators, such as min-, max-, or average-pooling, and\nautomatically adapt to the characteristics of the sound sources in question. We\nevaluate the proposed pooling operators on three datasets, and demonstrate that\nin each case, the proposed methods outperform non-adaptive pooling operators\nfor static prediction, and nearly match the performance of models trained with\nstrong, dynamic annotations.

I. The DNA changes that\ncontribute to cell transformation of a LC can be generated in the LCs in\nmarrow, thymus, lymph nodes (LNs), and/or lymphoid tissues (LTs). In LNs/LTs,\npathogen-infections may be the main cause for cell injuries of LCs.

In thymus, thymic\ninvolution and death of stromal cells may be a damaging factor for the\ndeveloping T-cells. II. Point DNA mutation (PDM) and chromosome change (CC) are\nthe two major types of DNA changes. CCs include numerical CCs (NCCs) and\nstructural CCs (SCCs). Generation of a PDM/SCC may be a result of Misrepair of\nDNA on DNA breaks. Generation of NCC is rather a consequence of dysfunction of\ncell division. III. Repeated cell injuries and cell proliferation drive the\naccumulation of DNA changes in LCs and HSCs.

Previous approaches, rather than\ncomputing a loss on the reconstructed signal, used a surrogate loss based on\nthe target STFT magnitudes. This ignores reconstruction error introduced by\nphase inconsistency. In our approach, the loss function is directly defined on\nthe reconstructed signals, which are optimized for best separation. In\naddition, we train through unfolded iterations of a phase reconstruction\nalgorithm, represented as a series of STFT and inverse STFT layers. While mask\nvalues are typically limited to lie between zero and one for approaches using\nthe mixture phase for reconstruction, this limitation is less relevant if the\nestimated magnitudes are to be used together with phase reconstruction. We thus\npropose several novel activation functions for the output layer of the T-F\nmasking, to allow mask values beyond one.

Unlike in traditional\nmodification-based steganography, in our method the stego image is directly\nsampled by a powerful generator: no explicit cover is used. Both parties share\na secret key used for message embedding and extraction. The Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence is introduced as a new criterion for evaluating the security of\ngenerative steganography. Based on these principles, we propose a simple\npractical generative steganography method that uses semantic image inpainting.\nThe message is written in advance to an uncorrupted region that needs to be\nretained in the corrupted image. Then, the corrupted image with the secret\nmessage is fed into a Generator trained by a generative adversarial network\n(GAN) for semantic completion. Message loss and prior loss terms are proposed\nfor penalizing message extraction error and unrealistic stego image.

There exists only a handful of methods which classify\npatients by viral load patterns. Most methods place limits on the use of viral\nload measurements, are often specific to a particular study design, and do not\naccount for complex, temporal variation. To address this issue, we propose a\nset of four unambiguous computable characteristics (features) of time-varying\nHIV viral load patterns, along with a novel centroid-based classification\nalgorithm, which we use to classify a population of 1,576 HIV positive clinic\npatients into one of five different viral load patterns (clusters) often found\nin the literature: durably suppressed viral load (DSVL), sustained low viral\nload (SLVL), sustained high viral load (SHVL), high viral load suppression\n(HVLS), and rebounding viral load (RVL). The centroid algorithm summarizes\nthese clusters in terms of their centroids and radii. We show that this allows\nnew viral load patterns to be assigned pattern membership based on the distance\nfrom the centroid relative to its radius, which we term radial normalization\nclassification. This method has the benefit of providing an objective and\nquantitative method to assign viral load pattern membership with a concise and\ninterpretable model that aids clinical decision making. This method also\nfacilitates meta-analyses by providing computably distinct HIV categories.\nFinally we propose that this novel centroid algorithm could also be useful in\nthe areas of cluster comparison for outcomes research and data reduction in\nmachine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 22:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

We propose two different\nmethods of finding a linear space from a model: the first is the \\emph{linear\nclosure} which is the smallest linear space which contains the model, and the\nsecond is the \\emph{linear version} which changes multiplicative constraints in\nthe model to additive ones. For each of these linear spaces we then find the\nLie closures of them. Under both methods, it was found that closed codon models\nwould require thousands of parameters, and that any partial solution to this\nproblem that was of a reasonable size violated stochasticity. Investigation of\ntoy models indicated that finding the Lie closure of matrix linear spaces which\ndeviated only slightly from a simple model resulted in a Lie closure that was\nclose to having the maximum number of parameters possible.

The agent trained with this approach is able\nto actively acquire information by asking questions about novel objects and use\nthe just-learned knowledge in subsequent conversations in a one-shot fashion.\nResults compared with other methods verified the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

A wireless sensor can collect, analyze, and transmit measurements\nof its environment. To date, wireless sensors used in IoT are predominately\nbased on electronic devices that may suffer from electromagnetic interference\nin many circumstances. Immune to the electromagnetic interference, optical\nsensors provide a significant advantage in harsh environments. Furthermore, by\nintroducing optical resonance to enhanced light-matter interactions, optical\nsensors based on resonators exhibit small footprints, extreme sensitivity and\nversatile functionalities, which can signifi-cantly enhance the capability and\nflexibility of wireless sensors.

Here, we report an innovative mechanism that allows\nmultifold reconfiguration of mechanical rotation of semiconductor nanoentities\nin electric (E) fields by visible light stimulation. When illuminated by light\nin the visible to infrared range, the rotation speed of semiconductor Si\nnanowires in electric fields can instantly increase, decrease, and even reverse\nthe orientation depending on the intensity of the applied light and the AC\nE-field frequency. This multifold rotation configuration is highly efficient,\ninstant, and facile. Switching between different modes can be simply controlled\nby the light intensity at an AC frequency. An array of experimentations,\ntheoretical analysis, and simulations are carried out to understand the\nunderlying principle, which can be attributed to the optically tunable\npolarization of Si nanowires in aqueous suspension and an external electric\nfield. Finally, leveraging this newly discovered effect, we successfully\ndifferentiate semiconductor and metallic nanoentities in a non-contact and\nnon-destructive manner.
