Among other insights,\nthese observations help explain the existence of negative pulse spectral lags,\nand allow us to conclude that GRB pulses are less common, more complex, and\nhave longer durations than previously thought. Because structured emission\nmechanisms that can operate forwards and backwards in time seem unlikely, we\nlook to $\\textit{kinematic}$ behaviors to explain the time-reversed light curve\nstructures.

The\nRMS approach can be performed up to larger heights where the noise level is\ngreater, provided that the noise itself can be quantified.

The radiative transfer is carried out with POLARIS for\nwavelengths from 70 $\\mu$m to 3 mm at a resolution of 0.12 pc, and includes\nself-consistently calculated alignment efficiencies for radiative torque\nalignment.

The depolarisation is rather caused by strong variations of the magnetic\nfield direction along the LOS due to turbulent motions. The observed magnetic\nfield structure thus resembles best the mass-weighted, line-of-sight averaged\nfield structure. Furthermore, it differs by only a few 1$^\\circ$ for different\nwavelengths and is little affected by the spatial resolution of the synthetic\nobservations.

High-resolution imaging of Kepler and K2 planet\ncandidate hosts to detect very close (within ~0.5\") background or bound stellar\ncompanions has been crucial for both confirming the planetary nature of\ncandidates, and the determination of accurate planetary radii and mean\ndensities. Here we present an investigation of the effect of close companions,\nboth detected and undetected, on the observed (raw count) exoplanet radius\ndistribution.

Demaine et al. [ACM\nTrans. on Algorithms, 6(1), 2009] showed how to compute the edit distance\nbetween rooted trees on $n$ nodes in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3})$ time. However,\ngeneralizing their method to unrooted trees seems quite problematic, and the\nmost efficient known solution remains to be the previous $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}\\log\nn)$ time algorithm by Klein [ESA 1998]. Given the lack of progress on improving\nthis complexity, it might appear that unrooted trees are simply more difficult\nthan rooted trees. We show that this is, in fact, not the case, and edit\ndistance between unrooted trees on $n$ nodes can be computed in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^{3})$ time.

Within this general class of systems, we consider time-triggered\nstochastic hybrid systems (TTSHS), where the state evolves continuously\naccording to a linear time-varying dynamical system. Discrete events occur\nbased on an underlying renewal process (timer), and the intervals between\nsuccessive events follow an arbitrary continuous probability density function.\nMoreover, whenever the event occurs, the state is reset based on a linear\naffine transformation that allows for the inclusion of state-dependent and\nindependent noise terms. Our key contribution is derivation of necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the stability of statistical moments, along with\nexact analytical expressions for the steady-state moments. These results are\nillustrated on an example from cell biology, where deterministic synthesis and\ndecay of a gene product (RNA or protein) is coupled to random timing of\ncell-division events. As experimentally observed, cell-division events occur\nbased on an internal timer that measures the time elapsed since the start of\ncell cycle (i.e., last event). Upon division, the gene product level is halved,\ntogether with a state-dependent noise term that arises due to randomness in the\npartitioning of molecules between two daughter cells. We show that the TTSHS\nframework is conveniently suited to capture the time evolution of gene product\nlevels, and derive unique formulas connecting its mean and variance to\nunderlying model parameters and noise mechanisms. Systematic analysis of the\nformulas reveal counterintuitive insights, such as, if the partitioning noise\nis large then making the timing of cell division more random reduces noise in\ngene product levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 17:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

The ETPIR problem is\ncomprised of $K$ messages, $N$ servers where each server stores all $K$\nmessages, a user who wants to retrieve one of the $K$ messages without\nrevealing the desired message index to any set of $T$ colluding servers, and an\neavesdropper who can listen to the queries and answers of any $E$ servers but\nis prevented from learning any information about the messages. The information\ntheoretic capacity of ETPIR is defined to be the maximum number of desired\nmessage symbols retrieved privately per information symbol downloaded. We show\nthat the capacity of ETPIR is $C = \\left( 1- \\frac{E}{N} \\right) \\left(1 +\n\\frac{T-E}{N-E} + \\cdots + \\left( \\frac{T-E}{N-E} \\right)^{K-1} \\right)^{-1}$\nwhen $E < T$, and $C = \\left( 1 - \\frac{E}{N} \\right)$ when $E \\geq T$.

Otherwise, with less amount of shared\ncommon randomness, ETPIR is not feasible and the capacity reduces to zero.\n  An interesting observation is that the ETPIR capacity expression takes\ndifferent forms in two regimes. When $E < T$, the capacity equals the inverse\nof a sum of a geometric series with $K$ terms and decreases with $K$; this form\nis typical for capacity expressions of PIR. When $E \\geq T$, the capacity does\nnot depend on $K$, a typical form for capacity expressions of SPIR (symmetric\nPIR, which further requires data-privacy, {\\it i.e.,} the user learns no\ninformation about other undesired messages); the capacity does not depend on\n$T$ either.

To carry this out, a sample of 4663 quasars (QSOs) in the\nredshift range of 0.20 to 0.40 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey--Data Release\n7 was analyzed. Three QSO sub-samples were defined, taking into account the\nprojected separations and radial velocity differences with neighboring\ngalaxies. In this way, we utilized two sub-samples of QSOs with strong and weak\ngalaxy interactions, with projected separations smaller than 70 kpc, and\nbetween 70 and 140 kpc, respectively, and with radial velocity differences less\nthan $5000~$\\kms. These sub-samples were compared with isolated QSOs defined as\nhaving greater projected separations and radial velocity differences to the\ngalaxies. From a statistical study of the EWs of relevant spectral lines in the\nQSOs, we show an increment of the EWs of about 20\\% in the [OIII]4959,5007\nlines and 7\\% in H$_\\alpha$ for QSOs with stronger galaxy interactions relative\nto the isolated QSOs. These results indicate that some line EWs of QSOs could\nbe marginally influenced by the environment and that they are not affected by\nthe emission of the host galaxy, which was estimated to be around 10\\% of the\ntotal emission. Furthermore, in order to gain a better understanding of the\norigin of the H$_{\\alpha}$ emission line, we performed broad and narrow line\ndecomposition in 100 QSOs in the restricted Sint sub-sample and also 100\nrandomly selected QSOs in the Iso sub-sample. When these QSOs were compared,\nthe narrow component remained constant whereas the broad component was\nincremented. Our results, which reveal slight differences in EWs of some\nemission lines, suggest that galaxy interactions with QSOs may affect the QSO\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Recently, parameterized sublimative torque models have\nbeen developed to study rotation state changes of individual comet nuclei and\npopulations of cometary bodies. However, these models simplify the interactions\nbetween the escaping gas and cometary surface into only a few parameters that\nhide the details of these complex interactions. Here we directly compare the\nX-parameter model (Samarasinha & Mueller, 2013) with the SYORP model (Steckloff\n& Jacobson, 2016) to tease out insights into the details of the gas-surface\ninteractions driving sublimative torques. We find that, for both of these\nmodels to accurately model sublimative torques, the number of sublimating\nmolecules that contribute to the net torque is largely independent of the\ndetailed shape and activity of the nucleus, but rather depends primarily on the\nsize of the nucleus and the effective heliocentric distance of the comet. We\nsuggest that cometary activity must be largely restricted to regions of steep\ngravitational surface slopes (above the angle of repose), where mass wasting\ncan refresh activity by shedding mantles of refractory materials and exposing\nfresh volatiles. We propose a new classification scheme for comets based on the\nfrequency of this mass-wasting process (relative to the timescale of activity\nfading): quasi-equilibrium, episodic, quasi-dormant, and extinct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Systems such as ProbLog, PITA, etc., use propositional data\nstructures like explanation graphs, BDDs, SDDs, etc., to represent the possible\nworlds.

Starting from\na high symmetry optical flux lattice, we superpose a scalar potential with a\nsuper- or sublattice period in order to eliminate links between the original\nlattice sites. As an alternative to changing connectivity, the approach can\nalso be used to create or remove lattice sites from the underlying parent\nlattice. To demonstrate our concept, we consider the dice lattice geometry as\nan explicit example, and construct a dice lattice with a flux density of half a\nflux quantum per plaquette, providing a pathway to flat bands with a large band\ngap. While the intuition for our proposal stems from analysis of deep optical\nlattices, we demonstrate that the approach is robust even for shallow optical\nflux lattices far from the tight-binding limit. We also provide an alternative\nexperimental proposal to realize a synthetic gauge field in a fully frustrated\ndice lattice based on laser-induced hoppings along individual bonds of the\nlattice, again involving a superlattice potential. In this approach, atoms with\na long-lived excited state are trapped using an 'anti-magic' wavelength of\nlight, allowing the desired complex hopping elements to be induced in a\nspecific laser coupling scheme for the dice lattice geometry. We conclude by\ncomparing the complexity of these alternative approaches, and advocate that\ncomplex optical flux lattices provide the more elegant and easily generalisable\nstrategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 19:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

This article presents\ndevelopments towards accurate simulation of the annihilation process for use in\na cold, free neutron beam for neutron-antineutron searches from\nantineutron-carbon annihilation, as carbon-12 is the target of choice for the\nEuropean Spallation Source's NNBar Collaboration. Initial efforts are also made\nin this paper to perform analogous studies for intra-nuclear transformation\nsearches in argon-40 nuclei, although this latter work will be properly\naddressed in our next publication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 20:23:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 19:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 14:39:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 19:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Nonstationary\ndynamics pose both theoretical and practical challenges to statistical machine\nlearning algorithms that aim to accurately capture the complexities governing\nthe evolution of such processes. Typically the nonstationary dynamics are\nmodeled using nonstationary Gaussian Process models (NGPS) that employ local\nlatent dynamics parameterization to correspondingly model the nonstationary\nreal observable dynamics. Recently, an approach based on most likely induced\nlatent dynamics representation attracted research community's attention for a\nwhile. The approach could not be employed for large scale real world\napplications because learning a most likely latent dynamics representation\ninvolves maximization of marginal likelihood of the observed real dynamics that\nbecomes intractable as the number of induced latent points grows with problem\nsize.

First, the use of narrow beams and the\nsensitivity of mmWave signals to blockage greatly impact the coverage and\nreliability of highly-mobile links. Second, highly-mobile users in dense mmWave\ndeployments need to frequently hand-off between base stations (BSs), which is\nassociated with critical control and latency overhead. Further, identifying the\noptimal beamforming vectors in large antenna array mmWave systems requires\nconsiderable training overhead, which significantly affects the efficiency of\nthese mobile systems. In this paper, a novel integrated machine learning and\ncoordinated beamforming solution is developed to overcome these challenges and\nenable highly-mobile mmWave applications. In the proposed solution, a number of\ndistributed yet coordinating BSs simultaneously serve a mobile user. This user\nideally needs to transmit only one uplink training pilot sequence that will be\njointly received at the coordinating BSs using omni or quasi-omni beam\npatterns.

Thus, it is essential to be able to recognize these equations, to\nbe able to identify their type, and to see where they belong in the\nclassification scheme. The definite classification scheme for dP equations was\nproposed by H. Sakai, who used geometric ideas to identify 22 different classes\nof these equations. However, in a major contrast with the theory of ordinary\ndifferential Painlev\\'e equations, there are infinitely many non-equivalent\ndiscrete equations in each class. Thus, there is no general form for a dP\nequation in each class, although some nice canonical examples in each equation\nclass are known. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate that, in\naddition to providing the classification scheme, the geometric ideas of Sakai\ngive us a powerful tool to study dP equations. We consider a very complicated\nexample of a dP equation that describes a simple Schlesinger transformation of\na Fuchsian system and we show how this equation can be identified with a much\nsimpler canonical example of the dP equation of the same type and moreover, we\ngive an explicit change of coordinates transforming one equation into the\nother. Among our main tools are the birational representation of the affine\nWeyl symmetry group of the equation and the period map. Even though we focus on\na concrete example, the techniques that we use are general and can be easily\nadapted to other examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 04:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2018 05:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

Network embedding learns low dimensional representations\nof the nodes, which can further be used for downstream network mining\napplications such as community detection or node clustering.

We have compared the bulge and the\nglobal properties of spirals and S0 galaxies in our sample and find indications\nthat spiral galaxies which host a classical bulge, preferentially get converted\ninto S0 population as compared to pseudobulge hosting spirals. By studying the\nstar formation properties of our galaxies in the NUV-r color-mass diagram, we\nfind that the pseudobulge hosting spirals are mostly star forming while the\nmajority of classical bulge host spirals are in the green valley or in the\npassive sequence. We suggest that some internal process, such as AGN feedback\nor morphological quenching due to the massive bulge, quenches these classical\nbulge hosting spirals and transforms them into S0 galaxies, thus resulting in\nthe observed predominance of the classical bulge in S0 galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 08:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. In particular,\nwe adopt the cyber-insurance as an economic tool for neutralizing cyber risks\ndue to attacks in blockchain networks. We consider a blockchain service market,\nwhich is composed of the infrastructure provider, the blockchain provider, the\ncyber-insurer, and the users. The blockchain provider purchases from the\ninfrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the\nblockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The\nblockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the\nservice price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the\nblockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider\nalso purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from\nthe potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts\nthe insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain\nservice.

An\nMEC environment consists of many MEC servers and ubiquitous access points\ninterconnected into an edge cloud network. Mobile users can offload their\ncomputing-intensive tasks to one or multiple MEC servers for execution to save\ntheir batteries. Due to large numbers of MEC servers deployed in MEC, selecting\na subset of servers to serve user tasks while satisfying delay requirements of\ntheir users is challenging. In this paper, we formulate a novel delay-energy\njoint optimization problem through jointly considering the CPU-cycle frequency\nscheduling at mobile devices, server selection to serve user offloading tasks,\nand task allocations to the selected servers. To this end, we first formulate\nthe problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, due to the hardness to\nsolve this nonlinear programming, we instead then relax the problem into a\nnonlinear programming problem that can be solved in polynomial time.

New experimental approaches extended the availability\nof fissioning systems considerably and provided a full identification of all\nfission products in A and Z for the first time. In particular, the transition\nfrom symmetric to asymmetric fission around 226Th and some unexpected structure\nin the mass distributions in the fission of systems around Z = 80 to 84 as well\nas an extended systematics of the odd-even effect in fission fragment Z\ndistributions have been measured [A. N. Andreyev et al., Rep. Progr. Phys. 81\n(2018) 016301]. Three classes of theoretical descriptions of fission presently\nappear to be the most promising or the most successful ones: Self-consistent\nquantum-mechanical models fully consider the quantum-mechanical features of the\nfission process. Intense efforts are presently made to develop suitable\ntheoretical tools [N. Schunck, L. M. Robledo, Rep. Prog. Phys. 79 (2016)\n116301] for modeling the non-equilibrium, large-amplitude collective motion\nleading to fission. Stochastic, essentially classical models provide a fully\ndeveloped technical framework. The main features of the fission-fragment mass\ndistribution are well reproduced from mercury to fermium and beyond [P.\nM\\\"oller, J. Randrup, Phys. Rev. C 91 (2015) 044316]. In an alternative\nsemi-empirical approach [K.-H. Schmidt et al., Nucl. Data Sheets 131 (2016)\n107], considerable progress in describing the fission observables has been\nachieved by combining several general theoretical concepts.

While low-level\ncontrol systems take care of navigating such driverless vehicles along\nprogrammed routes and avoid collisions even under unforeseen circumstances, in\nthe common case of multiple vehicles sharing the same operation area, the\nproblem remains how to set up routes such that a collection of transport tasks\nis accomplished most effectively.

Such ad-hoc methods may suffice as long as a running production\nprocess remains in place, while any change in the factory layout or production\ntargets necessitates tedious manual reconfiguration, not to mention the missing\nportability between different production plants.

The\nadvantages include a transparent and executable problem formalization, provable\noptimality of routes relative to objective criteria, as well as elaboration\ntolerance towards particular factory layouts and production targets. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that our approach is efficient enough to deal with the transport\ntasks evolving in realistic production processes at the car factory of\nMercedes-Benz Ludwigsfelde GmbH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 11:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-30"}

This is mainly due to the fact that (1)\ncontrary to real world single-view (SV) datasets, MV datasets are often\ncaptured in controlled environments to collect precise 3D annotations, which do\nnot cover all real world challenges, and (2) the model parameters are learned\nfor specific camera setups. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage\napproach to detect and estimate 3D human poses, which separates SV pose\ndetection from MV 3D pose estimation. This separation enables us to utilize\neach dataset for the right task, i.e. SV datasets for constructing robust pose\ndetection models and MV datasets for constructing precise MV 3D regression\nmodels. In addition, our 3D regression approach only requires 3D pose data and\nits projections to the views for building the model, hence removing the need\nfor collecting annotated data from the test setup. Our approach can therefore\nbe easily generalized to a new environment by simply projecting 3D poses into\n2D during training according to the camera setup used at test time. As 2D poses\nare collected at test time using a SV pose detector, which might generate\ninaccurate detections, we model its characteristics and incorporate this\ninformation during training. We demonstrate that incorporating the detector's\ncharacteristics is important to build a robust 3D regression model and that the\nresulting regression model generalizes well to new MV environments.

Here, the identification of active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) is based on the VLBI detection of the source, i.e., it is\nindependent of X-ray or infrared properties. The milli-arcsecond resolution\nprovided by the VLBI technique implies that the detected sources must be\ncompact and have large brightness temperatures, and therefore they are most\nlikely AGN (when the host galaxy is located at z$\\geq$0.1). On the other hand,\nthis technique allows us to only positively identify when a radio-active AGN is\npresent, i.e., we cannot affirm that there is no AGN when the source is not\ndetected. For this reason, the number of identified AGN using VLBI should be\nalways treated as a lower limit. We present a catalogue containing the 35 radio\nsources detected with the VLBA+GBT, 10 of which were not previously detected\nusing only the VLBA. We have constructed the radio source counts at 1.4 GHz\nusing the samples of the VLBA and VLBA+GBT detected sources of the COSMOS field\nto determine a lower limit for the AGN contribution to the faint radio source\npopulation. We found an AGN contribution of >40-75% at flux density levels\nbetween 150 $\\mu$Jy and 1 mJy. This flux density range is characterised by the\nupturn of the Euclidean-normalised radio source counts, which implies a\ncontribution of a new population. This result supports the idea that the\nsub-mJy radio population is composed of a significant fraction of\nradio-emitting AGN, rather than solely by star-forming galaxies, in agreement\nwith previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 12:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

To understand why different forms of LL/lymphoma occur at\ndifferent ages, we analyzed the effects of different types of DNA changes on a\nLC and the cellular characteristics of LCs. Point DNA mutations (PDMs) and\nchromosome changes (CCs) are the two major types of DNA changes. CCs have three\nsubtypes by their effects on a LC: great-effect CCs (GECCs), mild-effect CCs\n(MECCs), and intermediate-effect CCs (IECCs). PDMs and MECCs are mostly mild\nthus can accumulate in cells. Some of the PDMs/MECCs contribute to cell\ntransformation. A GECC affects one or more genes and can alone drive cell\ntransformation. An IECC affects one or more genes and participates in cell\ntransformation. Due to cellular characteristics, a LC may have higher\nsurvivability from DNA changes and require obtaining fewer cancerous properties\nfor transformation than a tissue cell. Hence, a LC can be more rapidly\ntransformed by a CC. On this basis, we hypothesize that a LC may have three\npathways on transformation: a slow, a rapid, and an accelerated. Slow pathway\nis driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs. Rapid pathway is driven by a GECC in\n\"one step\". Accelerated pathway is driven by accumulation of\nPDMs/MECCs/IECC(s). Cell transformations of a LC via different pathways occur\nat different ages. A transformation via slow pathway occurs mainly in adults. A\ntransformation via rapid pathway occurs at any age and has no increasing\nincidence with age. A transformation via accelerated pathway occurs also at any\nage but has increasing incidence with age. In conclusion, a LC may have three\npathways on cell transformation, and the occurring age of LL/lymphoma may be\ndetermined by the transforming pathway of a LC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 13:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-30"}

Those small-scale cells,\nalthough provide higher data rates and better indoor coverage by reducing the\ndistance between base stations (BSs) and end users, have raised severe\nconfiguration concerns. As the deployments are becoming irregular and flexible,\ninappropriate configurations occur frequently and undermine the network\nreliability and service quality. We envision that the fine-grained\ncharacterization of user traffic is a key pillar to diagnosing inappropriate\nconfigurations. In this article, we investigate the fine-grained traffic\npatterns of mobile users by analyzing the network data containing millions of\nsubscribers and covering thousands of cells in a large metropolitan area.

Our starting\npoint is the classical notion of an abelian group-valued \"flow\" on an abstract\ngraph (Tutte, 1954). Typing a linear lambda term may be naturally seen as\nconstructing a flow (on an embedded 3-valent graph with boundary) valued in a\nmore general algebraic structure consisting of a preordered set equipped with\nan \"implication\" operation and unit satisfying composition, identity, and unit\nlaws. Interesting questions and results from the theory of flows (such as the\nexistence of nowhere-zero flows) may then be re-examined from the standpoint of\nlambda calculus and logic. For example, we give a characterization of when the\nlocal flow relations (across vertices) may be categorically lifted to a global\nflow relation (across the boundary), proving that this holds just in case the\nunderlying map has the orientation of a lambda term.

The aim of this work is to develop a novel\nCNN framework to reconstruct video sequence of dynamic live cells captured\nusing a computational microscopy technique, Fourier ptychographic microscopy\n(FPM). The unique feature of the FPM is its capability to reconstruct images\nwith both wide field-of-view (FOV) and high resolution, i.e. a large\nspace-bandwidth-product (SBP), by taking a series of low resolution intensity\nimages. For live cell imaging, a single FPM frame contains thousands of cell\nsamples with different morphological features. Our idea is to fully exploit the\nstatistical information provided by this large spatial ensemble so as to make\npredictions in a sequential measurement, without using any additional temporal\ndataset. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reconstruct high-SBP\ndynamic cell videos by a CNN trained only on the first FPM dataset captured at\nthe beginning of a time-series experiment. Our CNN approach reconstructs a\n12800X10800 pixels phase image using only ~25 seconds, a 50X speedup compared\nto the model-based FPM algorithm. In addition, the CNN further reduces the\nrequired number of images in each time frame by ~6X. Overall, this\nsignificantly improves the imaging throughput by reducing both the acquisition\nand computational times. The proposed CNN is based on the conditional\ngenerative adversarial network (cGAN) framework. Additionally, we also exploit\ntransfer learning so that our pre-trained CNN can be further optimized to image\nother cell types. Our technique demonstrates a promising deep learning approach\nto continuously monitor large live-cell populations over an extended time and\ngather useful spatial and temporal information with sub-cellular resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 02:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 20:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 22:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

There is one fact that flicker of\nLED light should be avoid in any VLC systems. Current flicker mitigation\nsolutions based on run-length limited (RLL) codes suffer from reduced code\nrates, or are limited to hard-decoding forward error correction (FEC) decoders.\nRecently, soft-decoding techniques of RLL-codes are proposed to support\nsoft-decoding FEC algorithms, but they contain potentials of high-complexity\nand time-consuming computations. Fortunately, non-RLL direct current\n(DC)-balance solutions can overcome the drawbacks of RLL-based algorithms,\nhowever, they meet some difficulties in system latency or inferior\nerror-correction performances. Recently, non-RLL flicker mitigation solution\nbased on Polar code has proved to be an optimal approach due to its natural\nequal probabilities of short runs of 1's and 0's with high error-correction\nperformance. However, we found that this solution can only maintain the DC\nbalance only when the data frame length is sufficiently long. Accordingly,\nshort beacon-based data frames might still be a big challenge for flicker\nmitigation in such non-RLL cases.

The concept of self-equilibrated nanoscale microprestress\nhas been accepted as a viable model for marked multi-decade decline of creep\nviscosity after the hydration effect became too feeble, and for increase of\ncreep viscosity after any sudden change of pore humidity or temperature.\nRecently, though, it appeared that the original microprestress-solidification\ntheory (MPS) predicts incorrectly the diffusion size effect on drying creep and\nthe delay of drying creep behind drying shrinkage. Presented here is an\nextension (XMPS) that overcomes both problems and also improves a few other\nfeatures of the model response. To this end, different nano- and macro-scale\nviscosities are distinguished. The aforementioned incorrect predictions are\novercome by a dependence of the macro-scale viscosity on the rate of pore\nhumidity change, which is a new feature inspired by previous molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations of a molecular layer of water moving between two parallel\nsliding C-S-H sheets. The aging is based on calculating the hydration degree,\nand the temperature change effect on pore relative humidity is taken into\naccount. Empirical formula for estimating the parameters of permeability\ndependence on pore humidity from concrete mix composition are also developed.\nExtensive validations by pertinent test data from the literature are\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 01:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

This paper presents \\textit{Touch-And-Guard (TAG)}, a system that\nuses hand touch as an intuitive manner to establish a secure connection between\na wristband wearable and the touched device. It generates secret bits from hand\nresonant properties, which are obtained using accelerometers and vibration\nmotors. The extracted secret bits are used by both sides to authenticate each\nother and then communicate confidentially. The ubiquity of accelerometers and\nmotors presents an immediate market for our system. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our system using an experimental prototype and conduct\nexperiments involving 12 participants with 1440 trials. The results indicate\nthat we can generate secret bits at a rate of 7.15 bit/s, which is 44% faster\nthan conventional text input PIN authentication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 15:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}
