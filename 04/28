It requires propagating error gradients sequentially from the\noutput layer all the way back to the input layer. The backward locking in\nbackpropagation algorithm constrains us from updating network layers in\nparallel and fully leveraging the computing resources. Recently, several\nalgorithms have been proposed for breaking the backward locking. However, their\nperformances degrade seriously when networks are deep. In this paper, we\npropose decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm for deep learning\noptimization with convergence guarantee. Firstly, we decouple the\nbackpropagation algorithm using delayed gradients, and show that the backward\nlocking is removed when we split the networks into multiple modules. Then, we\nutilize decoupled parallel backpropagation in two stochastic methods and prove\nthat our method guarantees convergence to critical points for the non-convex\nproblem. Finally, we perform experiments for training deep convolutional neural\nnetworks on benchmark datasets. The experimental results not only confirm our\ntheoretical analysis, but also demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve\nsignificant speedup without loss of accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 16:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2018 17:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

This allows us to reinterpret,\nrigorously prove and extend for general spherical models the main ideas of the\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) approach originally introduced in the 70s for\nthe Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. In particular, we establish a TAP\nrepresentation for the free energy, valid for any overlap value which can be\nsampled as many times as we wish in an appropriate sense. We call such overlaps\nmulti-samplable. The correction to the Hamiltonian in the TAP representation\narises in our analysis as the free energy of a certain model on an overlap\ndependent band. For the largest multi-samplable overlap it coincides with the\nOnsager reaction term from physics. For smaller multi-samplable overlaps the\nformula we obtain is new. We also derive the corresponding TAP equation for\ncritical points. We prove all the above without appealing to the celebrated\nParisi formula or the ultrametricity property.\n  We prove that any overlap value in the support of the Parisi measure is\nmulti-samplable. For generic models, we further show that the set of\nmulti-samplable overlaps coincides with a certain set that arises in the\ncharacterization for the Parisi measure by Talagrand. The ultrametric tree of\npure states can be embedded in the interior of the sphere in a natural way. For\nthis embedding, we show that the points on the tree uniformly maximize the free\nenergies we define.

Here\nwe simulate Europa's exosphere using a 3-D Monte Carlo routine including, for\nthe first time, the role of Europa's rotation on the evolution of exospheric\nmolecules throughout the orbit. We focus on O$_2$, sputtered by a trailing\nhemisphere source with a temperature-dependence under isotropic plasma\nconditions. We find that the O$_2$ component, while global, is not homogenous\nin Europa local time. Rather, the O$_2$ accumulates at the dusk hemisphere.\nWhen rotation is explicitly excluded, no diurnal asymmetries exist. We find\nthat the assumed thermal-dependence on the O$_2$ source is critical for a\ndiurnal asymmetry: the diurnal surface temperature profile is imprinted on to\nthe near-surface O$_2$ atmosphere, due to the small hop times of the\nnon-adsorbing O$_2$ effectively rotating with Europa. Altogether, our\nsimulations conclude that the dusk-over-dawn asymmetry is driven by Europa's\nday-night O$_2$ cycle synchronized with Europa's orbital period based on our\nmodel assumptions on O$_2$ production and loss. This conclusion is in agreement\nwith the recent understanding that a non-adsorbing, rotating O$_2$ source\npeaking at noon will naturally accumulate from dawn-to-dusk, should the O$_2$\nlifetime be sufficiently long compared to the orbital period. Lastly we compare\nhemispherically-averaged dusk-over-dawn ratios to the recently observed oxygen\nemission data by the Hubble Space Telescope.

Belovs and\nReichardt first showed that the positive witness size is exactly characterized\nby the effective resistance of the input graph, but only rough upper bounds\nwere known previously on the negative witness size. We show that the negative\nwitness size in an st-connectivity span program is exactly characterized by the\ncapacitance of the input graph. This gives a tight analysis for algorithms\nbased on st-connectivity span programs on any set of inputs.\n  We use this analysis to give a new quantum algorithm for estimating the\ncapacitance of a graph. We also describe a new quantum algorithm for deciding\nif a graph is connected, which improves the previous best quantum algorithm for\nthis problem if we're promised that either the graph has at least kappa > 1\ncomponents, or the graph is connected and has small average resistance, which\nis upper bounded by the diameter. We also give an alternative algorithm for\ndeciding if a graph is connected that can be better than our first algorithm\nwhen the maximum degree is small. Finally, using ideas from our second\nconnectivity algorithm, we give an algorithm for estimating the algebraic\nconnectivity of a graph, the second largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 16:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

Transmission power may vary from one\ntransmitter to another, and a transmitter's signal strength at a given point is\nmodeled by the transmitter's power divided by some constant power $\\alpha$ of\nthe distance it traveled. Roughly, a receiver at a given location can hear a\nspecific transmitter only if the transmitter's signal is stronger by a\nspecified ratio than the signals of all other transmitters combined. An SINR\nquery is to determine whether a receiver at a given location can hear any\ntransmitter, and if yes, which one.\n  An approximate answer to an SINR query is such that one gets a definite YES\nor definite NO, when the ratio between the strongest signal and all other\nsignals combined is well above or well below the reception threshold, while the\nanswer in the intermediate range is allowed to be either YES or NO.\n  We describe compact data structures that support approximate SINR queries in\nthe plane in a dynamic context, i.e., where transmitters may be inserted and\ndeleted over time. We distinguish between two main variants --- uniform power\nand non-uniform power. In both variants the preprocessing time is $O(n\n\\mathop{\\textrm{polylog}} n)$ and the amortized update time is\n$O(\\mathop{\\textrm{polylog}} n)$, while the query time is\n$O(\\mathop{\\textrm{polylog}} n)$ for uniform power, and randomized time\n$O(\\sqrt{n} \\mathop{\\textrm{polylog}} n)$ with high probability for non-uniform\npower.\n  Finally, we observe that in the static context the latter data structure can\nbe implemented differently, so that the query time is also\n$O(\\mathop{\\textrm{polylog}} n)$, thus significantly improving all previous\nresults for this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2018 19:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 17:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

Are there simpler ways to quickly generate models that\nperform as well as the more convoluted methods and also be human-readable?\n  To answer these questions, we explore a combination of LDA (Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation) and FFTs (Fast and Frugal Trees) to classify NASA software bug\nreports from six different projects.

For data-intensive applications that aim to keep\nthe overestimate error low, the count-min sketch may become too large to store\nin available RAM and may have to migrate to external storage (e.g., SSD.) Due\nto the random-read/write nature of hash operations of the count-min sketch,\nsimply placing it on SSD stifles the performance of time-critical applications,\nrequiring about 4-6 random reads/writes to SSD per estimate (lookup) and update\n(insert) operation.\n  In this paper, we expand on the preliminary idea of the Buffered Count-Min\nSketch (BCMS) [15], an SSD variant of the count-min sketch, that used hash\nlocalization to scale efficiently out of RAM while keeping the total error\nbounded. We describe the design and implementation of the buffered count-min\nsketch, and empirically show that our implementation achieves 3.7x-4.7x the\nspeedup on update (insert) and 4.3x speedup on estimate (lookup) operations.\n  Our design also offers an asymptotic improvement in the external-memory model\n[1] over the original data structure: r random I/Os are reduced to 1 I/O for\nthe estimate operation.

For a downlink C-RAN consisting of a single\ncluster of BSs and wireless backhaul, this paper studies the optimal cache size\nallocation strategy among the BSs and the optimal multicast beamforming\ntransmission strategy at the CP such that the user's requested messages are\ndelivered from the CP to the BSs in the most efficient way. We first state a\nmulticast backhaul rate expression based on a joint cache-channel coding\nscheme, which implies that larger cache sizes should be allocated to the BSs\nwith weaker channels. We then formulate a two-timescale joint cache size\nallocation and beamforming design problem, where the cache is optimized offline\nbased on the long-term channel statistical information, while the beamformer is\ndesigned during the file delivery phase based on the instantaneous channel\nstate information. By leveraging the sample approximation method and the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we develop efficient\nalgorithms for optimizing cache size allocation among the BSs, and quantify how\nmuch more cache should be allocated to the weaker BSs. We further consider the\ncase with multiple files having different popularities and show that it is in\ngeneral not optimal to entirely cache the most popular files first.

The main obstacle preventing to\nuse found regression models for prediction on the unseen test points is the\nabsence of a reasonable way to obtain CLR cluster labels when the values of\ntarget variable are unknown. In this paper we propose two novel approaches on\nhow to solve this problem. The first approach, predictive CLR builds a separate\nclassification model to predict test CLR labels.

At the\nsame time, the spin-singlet superconducting condensate was always assumed to\nstay neutral to magnetic impurities. Due to a spin-orbit coupling (SOC),\nhowever, Cooper pairs gain an admixture of spin-triplet correlated states which\nprovide for a link between impurity spins and an s-wave condensate. It is shown\nthat its static Goldstone mode mediates the $1/r^2$ interaction of the spins in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) systems. This effect is considered within two models: of a\nclean 2D s-wave superconductor with the strong Rashba SOC and of a bilayer\nsystem combining a 2D Rashba coupled electron gas and an s-wave superconducting\nfilm. The predicted long-range interaction can have a strong effect on a spin\norder in superconductor-magnetic impurity systems that are expected to host\nMajorana fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2018 07:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 09:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-10"}

In a previous work [Correia {\\it et\nal.}, Phys.Rev.D90, 023521 (2014)] we numerically studied the evolution of\nvarious types of biased domain wall networks in the early universe, confirming\nthat anisotropic networks ultimately reach scaling while those with a biased\npotential or biased initial conditions decay.

Here we extend our previous work in several ways. For the cases of biased\npotential and biased initial conditions we study in detail the field\ndistributions in the simulations, confirming that the validity (or not) of the\nGaussian approximation is the key difference between the two cases. For\nanisotropic walls we carry out a more extensive set of numerical simulations\nand compare them to the canonical velocity-dependent one-scale model for domain\nwalls, finding that the model accurately predicts the linear scaling regime\nafter isotropization.

As it is well\nknown, a nontrivial behavior of conductivity in metals in strong magnetic\nfields is connected usually with appearance of non-closed quasiclassical\nelectron trajectories on the Fermi surface in a magnetic field. The structure\nof the electron trajectories depends strongly on the direction of the magnetic\nfield and usually the greatest interest is caused by open trajectories that are\nstable to small rotations of the direction of $\\, {\\bf B} $. The geometry of\nthe corresponding Stability Zones on the angular diagram in the space of\ndirections of $\\, {\\bf B} \\, $ represents a very important characteristic of\nthe electron spectrum in a metal linking the parameters of the spectrum to the\nexperimental data. Here we will consider some very general features inherent in\nthe angular diagrams of metals with Fermi surfaces of the most arbitrary form.\nIn particular, we will show here that any Stability Zone actually has a second\nboundary, restricting a larger region with a certain behavior of conductivity.\nBesides that, we shall discuss here general questions of complexity of the\nangular diagrams for the conductivity and propose a theoretical scheme for\ndividing the angular diagrams into \"simple\" and \"complex\" diagrams.

In this work, we combine 15 large neuroimaging\ndatasets to study bias. First, we detect bias by demonstrating that scans can\nbe correctly assigned to a dataset with 73.3% accuracy.

Unfortunately, the existing techniques have their own limitations. For\ninstance, the communication-based approach (e.g., transmission of GPS\ninformation) has high latency and low reliability while the reflection-based\napproach (e.g., RADAR) is incapable of detecting hidden vehicles (HVs) without\nline-of-sight. This is arguably the reason behind some recent fatal accidents\ninvolving autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, this paper presents a\nnovel HV-sensing technology that exploits multi-path transmission from a HV to\na sensing vehicle (SV). The powerful technology enables the SV to detect\nmultiple HV-state parameters including position, orientation of driving\ndirection, and size. Its implementation does not even require\ntransmitter-receiver synchronization like conventional mobile positioning\ntechniques. Our design approach leverages estimated information on multi-path\n(AoA/AoD/ToA) and their geometric relations. As a result, a complex system of\nequations or optimization problems, where the desired HV-state parameters are\nvariables, can be formulated for different channel-noise conditions. The\ndevelopment of intelligent solution methods ranging from least-square estimator\nto disk/box minimization yields a set of practical HV-sensing techniques. We\nstudy their feasibility conditions in terms of the required number of paths.\nFurthermore, practical solutions, including sequential path combining and\nrandom directional beamforming, are proposed to enable HV-sensing given\ninsufficient paths. Last, realistic simulation of driving in both highway and\nrural scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. In\nsummary, the proposed technique will enhance the capabilities of existing\nvehicular sensing technologies by enabling HV-sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2018 09:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2018 01:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 06:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 06:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 05:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a machine learning\ntechnique that is effective in classification tasks.

To deal with this problem, cost-sensitive approaches\nassign different misclassification costs for different classes without\ndisrupting the true data sample distributions. However, due to lack of prior\nknowledge, the misclassification costs are usually unknown and hard to choose\nin practice. Moreover, it has not been well studied as to how cost-sensitive\nlearning could improve DBN performance on imbalanced data problems. This paper\nproposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive deep belief network (ECS-DBN) for\nimbalanced classification.

Such causality notion appeared in the literature\nwithin the framework of operational probabilistic theories. It is a genuinely\ntheoretical notion, corresponding to establish a definite partial order among\nevents, in the same way as we do by using the future causal cone on Minkowski\nspace. The causality notion is logically completely independent of the\nmisidentified concept of \"determinism\", and, being a consequence of quantum\ntheory, is ubiquitous in physics. In addition, as classical theory can be\nregarded as a restriction of quantum theory, causality holds also in the\nclassical case, although the determinism of the theory trivializes it. I then\nconclude arguing that causality naturally establishes an arrow of time. This\nimplies that the scenario of the \"Block Universe\" and the connected \"Past\nHypothesis\" are incompatible with causality, and thus with quantum theory: they\nboth are doomed to remain mere interpretations and, as such, not falsifiable,\nsimilar to the hypothesis of \"super-determinism\".

Vessels and\nducts are present in all breast images, and spiculations radiating from a mass\ncan indicate malignancy. Accordingly, fiber objects are one of the three types\nof signals used in the American College of Radiology digital mammography\n(ACR-DM) accreditation phantom. This work focuses on the image properties of\nfiber-like structures in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and how image\nreconstruction can affect their appearance. The impact of DBT image\nreconstruction algorithm and regularization strength on the conspicuity of\nfiber-like signals of various orientations is investigated in simulation. A\nmetric is developed to characterize this orientation dependence and allow for\nquantitative comparison of algorithms and associated parameters in the context\nof imaging fiber signals. The imaging properties of fibers, characterized in\nsimulation, are then demonstrated in detail with physical DBT data of the\nACR-DM phantom. The characterization of imaging of fiber signals is used to\nexplain features of an actual clinical DBT case. For the algorithms\ninvestigated, at low regularization setting, the results show a striking\nvariation in conspicuity as a function of orientation in the viewing plane. In\nparticular, the conspicuity of fibers nearly aligned with the plane of the\nX-ray source trajectory is decreased relative to more obliquely oriented\nfibers. Increasing regularization strength mitigates this orientation\ndependence at the cost of increasing depth blur of these structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2018 14:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 16:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Such applications aim at bridging the virtual\nand real worlds through sensors and actuators. Actuators are responsible for\nthe execution of sensory effects (e.g., wind, heat, light), which produce\nsensory stimulations on the users. In these applications sensory stimulation\nmust happen in a timely manner regarding the other traditional media content\nbeing presented. For example, at the moment in which an explosion is presented\nin the audiovisual content, it may be adequate to activate actuators that\nproduce heat and light. It is common to use some declarative multimedia\nauthoring language to relate the timestamp in which each media object is to be\npresented to the execution of some sensory effect. One problem in this setting\nis that the synchronization of media objects and sensory effects is done\nmanually by the author(s) of the application, a process which is time-consuming\nand error prone.
