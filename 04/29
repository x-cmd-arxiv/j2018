Most existing security\ntesting techniques for DNNs try to find adversarial examples without providing\nany formal security guarantees about the non-existence of such adversarial\nexamples. Recently, several projects have used different types of\nSatisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to formally check security\nproperties of DNNs. However, all of these approaches are limited by the high\noverhead caused by the solver.\n  In this paper, we present a new direction for formally checking security\nproperties of DNNs without using SMT solvers. Instead, we leverage interval\narithmetic to compute rigorous bounds on the DNN outputs. Our approach, unlike\nexisting solver-based approaches, is easily parallelizable. We further present\nsymbolic interval analysis along with several other optimizations to minimize\noverestimations of output bounds.\n  We design, implement, and evaluate our approach as part of ReluVal, a system\nfor formally checking security properties of Relu-based DNNs.

On a single 8-core machine\nwithout GPUs, within 4 hours, ReluVal is able to verify a security property\nthat Reluplex deemed inconclusive due to timeout after running for more than 5\ndays.

Our approach is based on formulating transfer from\nsource to target as a problem of geometric mean metric learning on manifolds.\nSpecifically, we exploit the curved Riemannian manifold geometry of symmetric\npositive definite (SPD) covariance matrices. We exploit a simple but important\nobservation that as the space of covariance matrices is both a Riemannian space\nas well as a homogeneous space, the shortest path geodesic between two\ncovariances on the manifold can be computed analytically. Statistics on the SPD\nmatrix manifold, such as the geometric mean of two matrices can be reduced to\nsolving the well-known Riccati equation. We show how the Ricatti-based solution\ncan be constrained to not only reduce the statistical differences between the\nsource and target domains, such as aligning second order covariances and\nminimizing the maximum mean discrepancy, but also the underlying geometry of\nthe source and target domains using diffusions on the underlying source and\ntarget manifolds. A key strength of our proposed approach is that it enables\nintegrating multiple sources of variation between source and target in a\nunified way, by reducing the combined objective function to a nested set of\nRicatti equations where the solution can be represented by a cascaded series of\ngeometric mean computations.

For each cutoff, we\nobtain the density parameter, the equation of state (EoS) and the deceleration\nparameter of the system. In case of future event horizon, we find out that the\nEoS parameter, $w_{D}$, can cross the phantom line, as a result the transition\nfrom deceleration to acceleration expansion of the universe can be achieved\nprovided the model parameters are chosen suitably. Then, we investigate the\ninstability of the sign-changeable interacting HDE model against perturbations\nin BD theory. For this purpose, we study the squared sound speed $v_s^2$ whose\nsign determines the stability of the model. When $v_s^2<0$ the model is\nunstable against perturbation. For future event horizon cutoff, our universe\ncan be stable (${v}^{2}_s>0$) depending on the model parameters. Then, we focus\non GO and Ricci cutoffs and find out that although other features of these two\ncutoffs seem to be consistent with observations, they cannot leads to stable\ndominated universe, except in special case with GO cutoff. Our studies confirm\nthat for the sign-changeable HDE model in the setup of BD cosmology, the event\nhorizon is the most suitable horizon which can passes all conditions and leads\nto a stable DE dominated universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2018 19:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In particular, existing deep\nlearning methods consider mostly either class balanced data or moderately\nimbalanced data in model training, and ignore the challenge of learning from\nsignificantly imbalanced training data. To address this problem, we formulate a\nclass imbalanced deep learning model based on batch-wise incremental minority\n(sparsely sampled) class rectification by hard sample mining in majority\n(frequently sampled) classes during model training. This model is designed to\nminimise the dominant effect of majority classes by discovering sparsely\nsampled boundaries of minority classes in an iterative batch-wise learning\nprocess.

Combining the spectral and photometry products of SPIRE and PACS we\nmodel the dust continuum Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) and the most\ncomplete $^{12}$CO Line SED reported so far toward the nuclear region of NGC\n253. Properties and excitation of the molecular gas were derived from a\nthree-component non-LTE radiative transfer model, using the SPIRE $^{13}$CO\nlines and ground based observations of the lower-$J$ $^{13}$CO and HCN lines,\nto constrain the model parameters. Three dust temperatures were identified from\nthe continuum emission, and three components are needed to fit the full CO\nLSED. Only the third CO component (fitting mostly the HCN and PACS $^{12}$CO\nlines) is consistent with a shock/mechanical heating scenario. A hot core\nchemistry is also argued as a plausible scenario to explain the high-$J$\n$^{12}$CO lines detected with PACS. The effect of enhanced cosmic ray\nionization rates, however, cannot be ruled out, and is expected to play a\nsignificant role in the diffuse and dense gas chemistry. This is supported by\nthe detection of ionic species like OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$, as well as the\nenhanced fluxes of the OH lines with respect to those of H$_2$O lines detected\nin both PACS and SPIRE spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2018 02:12:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 22:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

We propose Collaborative\nMemory Networks (CMN), a deep architecture to unify the two classes of CF\nmodels capitalizing on the strengths of the global structure of latent factor\nmodel and local neighborhood-based structure in a nonlinear fashion. Motivated\nby the success of Memory Networks, we fuse a memory component and neural\nattention mechanism as the neighborhood component. The associative addressing\nscheme with the user and item memories in the memory module encodes complex\nuser-item relations coupled with the neural attention mechanism to learn a\nuser-item specific neighborhood. Finally, the output module jointly exploits\nthe neighborhood with the user and item memories to produce the ranking score.\nStacking multiple memory modules together yield deeper architectures capturing\nincreasingly complex user-item relations. Furthermore, we show strong\nconnections between CMN components, memory networks and the three classes of CF\nmodels. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMN\non three public datasets outperforming competitive baselines.

Though\nthey both have residual flux as luminous as $10^{43}erg/s$, their PDLAs are\nquite different in, e.g., HI column density, metal line absorption strength,\nhigh-ionization absorption lines as well as residual flux strength. For J1456,\nthe HI column density is $20.6\\pm0.2$, with za=2.3138, nearly identical to the\nquasar redshift (z=2.3142) determined from the [OIII] emission line.

The metallicity of this system is quite low and\nthere is a lack of significant high-ionization absorption lines therein,\nsuggesting that the system is beyond the quasar host galaxy. The residual flux\nis wide (1000 km/s) in J1456, with a significance of $8\\sigma$, while also wide\n(1500 km/s) but with a smaller significance of $3\\sigma$ in J2153.

Dual to the ensemble control problem, ensemble estimation\ndeals with the problem of using a finite number of measurement outputs to\nestimate the initial condition of every individual system in the ensemble. We\nintroduce in the paper an innovative class of ensemble systems, termed\ndistinguished ensemble systems, and establish sufficient conditions for\ncontrollability and observability of such systems. Every distinguished ensemble\nsystem has two key components, namely distinguished control vector fields and\ncodistinguished observation functions. Roughly speaking, a set of vector fields\nis distinguished if it is closed (up to scaling) under Lie bracket, and\nmoreover, every vector field in the set can be obtained by a Lie bracket of two\nvector fields in the same set. Similarly, a set of functions is codistinguished\nto a set of vector fields if the Lie derivatives of the functions along the\ngiven vector fields yield (up to scaling) the same set of functions. We\ndemonstrate in the paper that the structure of a distinguished ensemble system\ncan significantly simplify the analysis of ensemble controllability and\nobservability, and can be used as a principle for ensemble system design.

Inspired by the success and\nmethodology of the AlphaGo Zero, MM-Tag formalizes the problem of sequence\ntagging with a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhanced Markov decision process\n(MDP) model, in which the time steps correspond to the positions of words in a\nsentence from left to right, and each action corresponds to assign a tag to a\nword. Two long short-term memory networks (LSTM) are used to summarize the past\ntag assignments and words in the sentence. Based on the outputs of LSTMs, the\npolicy for guiding the tag assignment and the value for predicting the whole\ntagging accuracy of the whole sentence are produced. The policy and value are\nthen strengthened with MCTS, which takes the produced raw policy and value as\ninputs, simulates and evaluates the possible tag assignments at the subsequent\npositions, and outputs a better search policy for assigning tags. A\nreinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to train the model parameters. Our\nwork is the first to apply the MCTS enhanced MDP model to the sequence tagging\ntask. We show that MM-Tag can accurately predict the tags thanks to the\nexploratory decision making mechanism introduced by MCTS.

Many of these complex tasks reduce to the computation of a global\nfunction of values privately held by the agents, such as the maximum or the\naverage. Distributed algorithms implementing these functions should rely on\nlimited assumptions on the topology of the network or the information available\nto the agents, reflecting the decentralized nature of the problem.\n  We present a randomized algorithm for computing the average in networks with\ndirected, time-varying communication topologies. With high probability, the\nsystem converges to an estimate of the average in linear time in the number of\nagents, provided that the communication topology remains strongly connected\nover time. This algorithm leverages properties of exponential random variables,\nwhich allows for approximating sums by computing minima. It is completely\ndecentralized, in the sense that it does not rely on agent identifiers, or\nglobal information of any kind. Besides, the agents do not need to know their\nout-degree; hence, our algorithm demonstrates how randomization can be used to\ncircumvent the impossibility result established in [1].\n  Using a logarithmic rounding rule, we show that this algorithm can be used\nunder the additional constraints of finite memory and channel capacity. We\nfurthermore extend the algorithm with a termination test, by which the agents\ncan decide irrevocably in finite time - rather than simply converge - on an\nestimate of the average.

Here we\nintroduce a network model of the hypothetical co-evolution of the two most\ncommon modes of cellular division for reproduction: by mitosis (supporting\nasexual reproduction) and by meiosis (supporting sexual reproduction). Our\nmodel is based on a random hypergraph, with two nodes for each possible\ngenotype, each encompassing both ncDNA and mtDNA. One of the nodes is\nnecessarily generated by mitosis occurring at a parent genotype, the other by\nmeiosis occurring at two parent genotypes. A genotype's fitness depends on the\ncompatibility of its ncDNA and mtDNA. The model has two probability parameters,\n$p$ and $r$, the former accounting for the diversification of ncDNA during\nmeiosis, the latter for the diversification of mtDNA accompanying both meiosis\nand mitosis. Another parameter, $\\lambda$, is used to regulate the relative\nrate at which mitosis- and meiosis-generated genotypes are produced. We have\nfound that, even though $p$ and $r$ do affect the existence of evolutionary\npathways in the network, the crucial parameter regulating the coexistence of\nthe two modes of cellular division is $\\lambda$. Depending on genotype size,\n$\\lambda$ can be valued so that either mode of cellular division prevails.

Despite an\nincreasing focus on the fracture behavior of organic-rich shale, the\nrelationships between geochemistry and fracture behavior remain unclear and\nthere is a scarcity of experimental data available. To this end, we carry out\n59 mesoscale scratch-based fracture tests on 14 specimens extracted from 7\nmajor gas shale plays both in the United States and in France. Post-scratch\ntesting imaging reveal fractures with small crack width of about 400 nm. The\nfracture toughness is evaluated using the energetic size effect law, which is\nextended to generic axisymmetric probes. A nonlinear anisotropic and multiscale\nfracture behavior is observed. In addition, a positive correlation is found\nbetween the fracture toughness and the presence of of kerogen, clay and\ncalcite. Moreover, the geochemistry is found to influence the timescale and the\nregime of propagation of the hydraulic fracture at the macroscopic\nlength-scale. In particular, shale systems rich in TOC, clay and calcite are\nmore likely to exhibit high values of the fluid lag and low hydraulic crack\nwidth. Our findings highlight the need for advanced constitutive models for\norganic-rich shale systems and advanced hydraulic fracturing solutions that can\nfully integrate the complex fracture response of organic-rich shale materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2018 13:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

The data were compared with\nnon-LTE model atmosphere synthetic spectra computed with CMFGEN and with CLOUDY\nmodels for ionized interstellar medium regions. Results: The current $m_V=18.8$\nmag, is the faintest at which this source has ever been observed.

We inevitably have the trade-off between the\naccuracy of structure learning and the cost we need to pay to perform a given\nmessage-passing based inference task because the learnt edge structures of data\ndependency and physical connectivity graph are often highly different. In this\npaper, we formalize this trade-off in an optimization problem which outputs the\ndata dependency graph that jointly considers learning accuracy and\nmessage-passing costs. We focus on a distributed MAP as the target inference\ntask, and consider two different implementations, ASYNC-MAP and SYNC-MAP that\nhave different message-passing mechanisms and thus different cost structures.\nIn ASYNC- MAP, we propose a polynomial time learning algorithm that is optimal,\nmotivated by the problem of finding a maximum weight spanning tree. In\nSYNC-MAP, we first prove that it is NP-hard and propose a greedy heuristic. For\nboth implementations, we then quantify how the probability that the resulting\ndata graphs from those learning algorithms differ from the ideal data graph\ndecays as the number of data samples grows, using the large deviation\nprinciple, where the decaying rate is characterized by some topological\nstructures of both original data dependency and physical connectivity graphs as\nwell as the degree of the trade-off. We validate our theoretical findings\nthrough extensive simulations, which confirms that it has a good match.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2018 14:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

In addition, fuel expenses due to traffic congestion in the U.S.\ntranslate to billions of dollars annually. These issues are motivating\nresearchers across many disciplines to develop strategies to implement\nautomation in transportation. The advent of connected-vehicle (CV) technology\nhas added a new dimension to the research. The CV technology allows a vehicle\nto communicate with roadside infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure), and\nother vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle) on roads wirelessly using dedicated\nshort-range communication (DSRC) protocol. Collectively, the vehicle-to-vehicle\n(V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication technologies are known\nas V2X technology. Automotive companies have started to include On-Board Units\n(OBUs) on latest automobiles which can run safety-critical and assistive\napplications using V2X technology. For example, US Department of Transportation\nhas already launched various applications including but not limited to\nlane-change assistance, collision avoidance, SPaT for emergency and transit\nvehicles. Merge conflicts, especially when vehicles are trying to merge from\nramps to freeways, are a significant source of collisions, traffic congestion\nand fuel use.

The freeway merge\nassistance system uses an innovative three-way handshaking protocol and\nprovides advisories to drivers to guide the merging sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2018 04:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

In this model with two\nsided preferences, stability is a well accepted notion of optimality. However,\nin the presence of lower quotas, a stable and feasible matching need not exist.\nFor the HRLQ problem, our goal therefore is to output a good feasible matching\nassuming that a feasible matching exists. Computing matchings with minimum\nnumber of blocking pairs (MinBP) and minimum number of blocking residents\n(MinBR) are known to be NP-Complete. The only approximation algorithms for\nthese problems work under severe restrictions on the preference lists. We\npresent an algorithm which circumvents this restriction and computes a popular\nmatching in the HRLQ instance. We show that on data-sets generated using\nvarious generators, our algorithm performs very well in terms of blocking pairs\nand blocking residents. Yokoi (ISAAC 2017) recently studied envy-free matchings\nfor the HRLQ problem. We propose a simple modification to Yokoi's algorithm to\noutput a maximal envy-free matching. We observe that popular matchings\noutperform envy-free matchings on several parameters of practical importance,\nlike size, number of blocking pairs, number of blocking residents.\n  In the absence of lower quotas, that is, in the Hospital Residents (HR)\nproblem, stable matchings are guaranteed to exist. Even in this case, we show\nthat popularity is a practical alternative to stability. For instance, on\nsynthetic data-sets generated using a particular model, as well as on real\nworld data-sets, a popular matching is on an average 8-10% larger in size,\nmatches more number of residents to their top-choice, and more residents prefer\nthe popular matching as compared to a stable matching.
