In the context of identifying causal\neffects of a treatment variable, we argue that such deviations should be chosen\nbased on the form of selection on unobservables they allow. For quantile\nindependence, we characterize this form of treatment selection. Specifically,\nwe show that quantile independence is equivalent to a constraint on the average\nvalue of either a latent propensity score (for a binary treatment) or the cdf\nof treatment given the unobservables (for a continuous treatment). In both\ncases, this average value constraint requires a kind of non-monotonic treatment\nselection. Using these results, we show that several common treatment selection\nmodels are incompatible with quantile independence. We introduce a class of\nassumptions which weakens quantile independence by removing the average value\nconstraint, and therefore allows for monotonic treatment selection. In a\npotential outcomes model with a binary treatment, we derive identified sets for\nthe ATT and QTT under both classes of assumptions. In a numerical example we\nshow that the average value constraint inherent in quantile independence has\nsubstantial identifying power. Our results suggest that researchers should\ncarefully consider the credibility of this non-monotonicity property when using\nquantile independence to weaken full independence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2018 16:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

Such a\nconstruction rests mainly on the so-called Lie theorem on integrability by\nquadratures. It is worth mentioning that, in the context of Hamiltonian\nsystems, the NCI has been for around 40 years, essentially, the unique\ncriterium for exact solvability expressed in the terms of first integrals\n(containing the usual Liouville-Arnold integrability criterium as a particular\ncase).

However, the advantages of PCDs may\nbe compromised by various hardware-related degradation factors. For example, at\nhigh count rate, quasi-coincident photons may be piled up and result in not\nonly lost counts but also distorted spectrums, which is called the pulse pileup\neffects. Considering the relative slow detection speed of current PCDs and high\nx-ray flux for clinical imaging, it is vital to develop an effective approach\nto compensate or correct for the pileup effect. The aim of this paper was to\ndevelop a model-free, end-to-end, and data-driven approach in the neural\nnetwork framework. We first introduce the trigger threshold concept to\nregularize the correction process. Then, we design a fully-connected cascade\nartificial neural network and train it with measurements and true counts.

Only in 2012 Sj\\\"oqvist et al.\nformulated a strategy to generate non-Abelian (i.e. holonomic) quantum gates\nthrough non-adiabatic transformation. Successful experimental demonstrations of\nthis concept followed on various physical qubit systems and proved the\nfeasibility of this fast, holonomic quantum gate concept. Despite these\nsuccesses, the experimental implementation of such non-Abelian quantum gates\nremains experimentally challenging since in general the emergence of a suitable\nholonomy requires encoding of the logical qubit within a three (or higher)\nlevel system being driven by two (or more) control fields.\n  A very recent proposal by Liang et al. offers an elegant solution generating\na non-Abelian, geometric quantum gate on a simple, two-level system driven by\none control field. Exploiting the concept of transitionless quantum driving it\nallows the generation of universal geometric quantum gates through\nsuperadiabatic evolution.

Various biological mechanisms have evolved that can tune the\nreflectivity for visible and ultraviolet light. These examples inspire many\nartificial systems for mimicking adaptive coloration to match the visual\nappearance to their surroundings. Thermal camouflage, however, has been an\noutstanding challenge which requires an ability to control of the emitted\nthermal radiation from the surface. Here we report a new class of active\nthermal surfaces capable of efficient real-time electrical-control of thermal\nemission over the full infrared (IR) spectrum without changing the temperature\nof the surface.

The algorithm for parameter\nestimation is developed to handle genome-wide-scale data. Through comprehensive\nsimulation studies, we demonstrated the advantages of LEP over the existing\nmethods. We further applied LEP to perform integrative analysis of Crohn's\ndisease from WTCCC and summary statistics from GWAS of some other diseases,\nsuch as Type 1 diabetes, Ulcerative colitis and Primary biliary cirrhosis. LEP\nwas able to significantly increase the statistical power of identifying risk\nvariants and improve the risk prediction accuracy from 63.39\\% ($\\pm$ 0.58\\%)\nto 68.33\\% ($\\pm$ 0.32\\%) using about 195,000 variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 01:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

Unfortunately, the access latency and energy of NVM is often higher\nthan those of DRAM, while the endurance of NVM is lower. Many DRAM-NVM hybrid\nmemory systems use DRAM as a cache to NVM, to achieve the low access latency,\nlow energy, and high endurance of DRAM, while taking advantage of the large\ncapacity of NVM. A key question for a hybrid memory system is what data to\ncache in DRAM to best exploit the advantages of each technology while avoiding\nthe disadvantages of each technology as much as possible.\n  We propose a new memory controller design that improves hybrid memory\nperformance and energy efficiency.

Accesses that are row buffer hits incur similar latencies (and energy\nconsumption) in both DRAM and NVM, whereas accesses that are row buffer misses\nincur longer latencies (and higher energy consumption) in NVM than in DRAM. To\nexploit this, we devise a policy that caches heavily-reused data that\nfrequently misses in the NVM row buffers into DRAM. Our policy tracks the row\nbuffer miss counts of recently-used rows in NVM, and caches in DRAM the rows\nthat are predicted to incur frequent row buffer misses.

Strong gravitationally lensed quasars are among the most interesting\nand useful observable extragalactic phenomena.

Indeed, even in this era of all-sky surveys, their\nrecognition remains a great challenge, with barely a few hundred currently\nknown systems. Aims. In this work we aim to detect new strongly lensed quasar\ncandidates in the recently published Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), which is the\nhighest spatial resolution astrometric and photometric all-sky survey,\nattaining effective resolutions from 0.4\" to 2.2\". Methods. We cross-matched a\nmerged list of quasars and candidates with the Gaia DR2 and found 1,839,143\ncounterparts within 0.5\". We then searched matches with more than two Gaia DR2\ncounterparts within 6\". We further narrowed the resulting list using astrometry\nand photometry compatibility criteria between the Gaia DR2 counterparts. A\nsupervised machine learning method, Extremely Randomized Trees, is finally\nadopted to assign to each remaining system a probability of being lensed.\nResults. We report the discovery of three quadruply-imaged quasar candidates\nthat are fully detected in Gaia DR2.

Using the maximum likelihood ansatz, we have developed a method for\nstate estimation such that the reconstructed density matrix does not have\nnegative eigenvalues and the errors are within the space of valid density\noperators. Due to interactions with the environment, unwanted changes occur in\nthe system, leading to decoherence. Controlling decoherence is one of the\nbiggest challenges to be overcome to build quantum computers. We have used\nseveral experimental strategies to decouple the quantum system from its\nenvironment. These strategies are based on how much we know about\nsystem-environment interaction and what states we want to preserve. We first\nconsider a case where we are aware of the system state but have no knowledge\nabout its interaction with the environment. We demonstrate the efficacy of the\nsuper-Zeno scheme to tackle decoherence in this case. Then we consider a\nsituation where only the subspace is known to which the system state belongs.\nTo address such a situation we used a nested Uhrig dynamical decoupling scheme.\nNext, we consider situations where we have knowledge of the state of the system\nas well as its interaction with the environment. In such situations, since the\nnoise model is known, decoupling strategies can be explicitly designed to\ncancel this noise. Using these decoupling strategies, we can experimentally\nextend the lifetime of time-invariant discord of two-qubit Bell-diagonal states\nand are also able to preserve the entanglement of three NMR qubits, to a\nremarkable extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 06:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

However, not all systems fall into this category,\nwith many body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to\nfail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain\nperfect insulators at non-zero temperature, which do not thermalize and\ntherefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. In this Colloquium\nwe review recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL\nsystems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and\nnon-equilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically,\nMBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of\nquasi-local integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive\nexplanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on\nquasi-local integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL\nsystems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local\nobservables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore,\nMBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in\nthermodynamic equilibrium. We outline the current theoretical understanding of\nthe quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic\nphases, and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition.\nExperimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well-isolated from an\nexternal thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL\nphase.

Although the\nattached-eddy hypothesis postulated by Townsend can be used to predict\nturbulence intensities and serves as a unified theory for the asymptotic\nbehaviors of turbulence, the presence of attached structures has not been\nconfirmed.Here, we demonstrate the logarithmic region of turbulence intensity\nby identifying wall-attached structures of velocity fluctuations ($u_i$)\nthrough direct numerical simulation of a moderate-Reynolds-number boundary\nlayer ($Re_\\tau \\approx 1000$). The wall-attached structures are self-similar\nwith respect to their heights ($l_y$), and in particular the population density\nof the streamwise component ($u$) scales inversely with $l_y$, which is\nreminiscent of the hierarchy of attached eddies. The turbulent intensities\ncontained within the wall-parallel components ($u$ and $w$) exhibit the\nlogarithmic behavior. The tall attached structures ($l_y^+ > 100$) of $u$ are\ncomposed of multiple uniform momentum zones (UMZs) with a long streamwise\nextent, whereas those of the cross-stream components ($v$ and $w$) are\nrelatively short with a comparable width, suggesting the presence of tall\nvortical structures associated with multiple UMZs. The magnitudes of the\nnear-wall peak observed in the streamwise turbulent intensity increase with\nincreasing $l_y$, reflecting nested hierarchies of the attached $u$ structures.\nThese findings suggest that the identified structures are prime candidates for\nTownsend's attached-eddy hypothesis and serve as cornerstones for understanding\nthe multiscale phenomena of high-Reynolds-number boundary layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 07:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

As a\ntype of blood cell, a MC may have higher survivability from DNAchanges and\nrequire obtaining fewer cancerous properties for cell transformation than a\ntissuecell. III. Point DNA mutations (PDMs) and chromosome changes (CCs) are\nthe two majortypes of DNA changes. CCs have three subtypes by effects on a\ncell: great effect CCs(GECCs), mild-effect CCs (MECCs), and intermediate-effect\nCCs (IECCs). A GECC affectsone or more genes and can alone trigger cell\ntransformation. PDMs/MECCs are mostly mildand can accumulate in cells. Some of\nthe PDMs/MECCs contribute to cell transformation.

The problem can be easily solved on\na word RAM with word length $w$ in time $O(n^2 \\log{n})$. Using Han's fast\ninteger sorting algorithm (2002/2004) this can be reduced to $O(n^2\n\\log{\\log{n}})$. With randomization or a sophisticated deterministic dictionary\nconstruction, creating a hash table for $X$ with constant lookup time leads to\nan algorithm with (expected) running time $O(n^2)$. At present, seemingly no\nfaster algorithms are known. We present a surprisingly simple deterministic,\nquadratic time algorithm for 3XOR.

Furthermore, aggregated data present a natural\n\\textit{multilevel} structure, where individuals or samples are nested within\ndifferent sites, such as countries or hospitals. Imputation of multilevel data\nhas therefore drawn some attention recently, but current solutions are not\ndesigned to handle mixed data, and suffer from important drawbacks such as\ntheir computational cost. In this article, we propose a single imputation\nmethod for multilevel data, which can be used to complete either quantitative,\ncategorical or mixed data. The method is based on multilevel singular value\ndecomposition (SVD), which consists in decomposing the variability of the data\ninto two components, the between and within groups variability, and performing\nSVD on both parts. We show on a simulation study that in comparison to\ncompetitors, the method has the great advantages of handling data sets of\nvarious size, and being computationally faster. Furthermore, it is the first so\nfar to handle mixed data. We apply the method to impute a medical data set\nresulting from the aggregation of several data sets coming from different\nhospitals. This application falls in the framework of a larger project on\nTrauma patients. To overcome obstacles associated to the aggregation of medical\ndata, we turn to distributed computation.

Dynamic loop scheduling (DLS)\ntechniques improve the performance of computationally-intensive scientific\napplications via load balancing of their execution on high-performance\ncomputing (HPC) systems. Identifying the most suitable choices of data\ndistribution strategies, system sizes, and DLS techniques which improve the\nperformance of a given application, requires intensive assessment and a large\nnumber of exploratory native experiments (using real applications on real\nsystems), which may not always be feasible or practical due to associated time\nand costs.

In last twenty years, cosmological\nobservations related to SNIa, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillations etc, have put stringent constraints on the the dark\nenergy evolution, still there is enough uncertainty in our knowledge about dark\nenergy that demands new generation of cosmological observations.\nPost-reionization neutral hydrogen 21 cm intensity mapping surveys are one of\nthe most promising future cosmological observations that have the potential to\nmap the cosmological evolution from dark ages till present time with\nunprecedented accuracy and Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is one of the most\nsensitive instruments to measure the post-reionization 21 cm signal. In this\nwork, we study the future dark energy constraints using post-reionization 21 cm\nintensity mapping power spectra with SKA1-mid specifications. We use three\ndifferent parametrizations for dark energy equation of state (EoS) including\nthe widely used CPL one. To generate simulated data, we use to two fiducial\nmodels: the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM and the best fit CPL model for\nPlanck+SNIa+BAO+HST. Our study shows that SKA1-mid alone has the potential to\nreach the present accuracy for combined Planck+SNIa+BAO+HST to constrain the\ndark energy behaviour. Whether dark energy is phantom or non-phantom or whether\nit exhibits phantom crossing, we may potentially address such questions with\nSKA1-mid. We also show that it is crucial to choose the correct parametrization\nfor dark energy equation of state as some parametrizations are better than\nothers to constrain the dark energy behaviour. Specifically, as observed in\nthis study, the widely used CPL parametrization may not give the best\nconstraint for dark energy behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 11:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

Fitting stellar models to\nthese mode frequencies, however, is more difficult than in main-sequence stars.\nThis is partly because of the uncertain magnitude of the surface effect: the\nsystematic difference between observed and modelled frequencies caused by poor\nmodelling of the near-surface layers. We aim to study the magnitude of the\nsurface effect in RGB stars. Surface effect corrections used for main-sequence\ntargets are potentially large enough to put the non-radial mixed modes in RGB\nstars out of order, which is unphysical. Unless this can be circumvented,\nmodel-fitting of evolved RGB stars is restricted to the radial modes, which\nreduces the number of available modes. Here, we present a method to suppress\ngravity modes (g-modes) in the cores of our stellar models, so that they have\nonly pure pressure modes (p-modes).

In all three\nstars, the surface effect decreases the model frequencies consistently by about\n0.1--0.3 $\\mu$Hz at the frequency of maximum oscillation power\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$, which agrees with existing predictions from\nthree-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Though our method in\nessence discards information about the stellar cores, it provides a useful step\nforward in understanding the surface effect in RGB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 12:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

We propose a\nnew theoretical and algorithmic framework to evaluate and reduce the noise\nlevel for PIC simulations based on the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) theory,\nwhich has been widely adopted in machine learning and big data science.\nAccording to this framework, the error on particle density estimation for PIC\nsimulations can be characterized by the Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE),\nwhich consists of two parts, systematic error and noise. A careful analysis\nshows that in the standard PIC methods noise is the dominate error, and the\nnoise level can be reduced if we select different shape functions that are\ncapable of balancing the systematic error and the noise. To improve\nperformance, we use the von Mises distribution as the shape function and seek\nan optimal particle width that minimizes the MISE, represented by a\nCross-Validation (CV) function. This procedure significantly reduces both the\nnoise and the MISE for PIC simulations. A particle-wise width adjustment\nalgorithm and a width update algorithm are further developed to reduce the\nMISE. Simulations using the examples of Langmuir wave and Landau Damping\ndemonstrate that the KDE algorithm developed in the present study reduces the\nnoise level on density estimation by 98%, and gives a much more accurate result\non the linear damping rate compared to the standard PIC methods. Meanwhile, it\nis computational efficient that can save 40% time to achieve the same accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 13:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 07:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

However, the requirement that the weak-field limit of the contracted\nBianchi identities should be consistent with the Newtonian limit of the local\nconservation laws, forbids a full coupling between space-time geometry and the\nactive stress-energy tensor. Nevertheless, in this paper it is shown how it is\npossible to relax the restrictions on quasi-metric space-time geometry\nsufficiently to avoid these problems. That is, the original quasi-metric field\nequations can be extended with one extra field equation, without having said\nfull coupling and such that the contracted Bianchi identities have a sensible\nNewtonian limit. For weak fields in vacuum, said extra field equation has a\ndynamical structure somewhat similar to that of its counterpart in canonical\ngeneral relativity (GR). In this way, the prediction of weak GR-like\ngravitational waves in vacuum becomes possible. Moreover, exact results from\nthe original quasi-metric gravitational theory are recovered for metrically\nstatic systems and for isotropic cosmology. This means that the current\nexperimental status of the extended quasi-metric gravitational theory is the\nsame as for the original theory, except for the prediction of weak GR-like\ngravitational waves in vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 14:12:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 21:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 13:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 23:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 22:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

It is common use to apply the binomial distribution to\ndetermine n to detect the presence of more than one species in the same sample,\nalthough the multinomial distribution should necessarily be used instead.\n  The mathematical theory of sample size computation using the multinomial\ndistribution is adapted to the computation of n for any number of species to be\ndetected together (K) at any level of confidence.

Video summarization, the task of finding the smallest subset\nof frames, which still conveys the whole story of a given video, is thus of\ngreat significance to improve efficiency of video understanding. We propose a\nnovel Dilated Temporal Relational Generative Adversarial Network (DTR-GAN) to\nachieve frame-level video summarization. Given a video, it selects the set of\nkey frames, which contain the most meaningful and compact information.\nSpecifically, DTR-GAN learns a dilated temporal relational generator and a\ndiscriminator with three-player loss in an adversarial manner. A new dilated\ntemporal relation (DTR) unit is introduced to enhance temporal representation\ncapturing. The generator uses this unit to effectively exploit global\nmulti-scale temporal context to select key frames and to complement the\ncommonly used Bi-LSTM. To ensure that summaries capture enough key video\nrepresentation from a global perspective rather than a trivial randomly shorten\nsequence, we present a discriminator that learns to enforce both the\ninformation completeness and compactness of summaries via a three-player loss.\nThe loss includes the generated summary loss, the random summary loss, and the\nreal summary (ground-truth) loss, which play important roles for better\nregularizing the learned model to obtain useful summaries.

Support for multiple page sizes\ncan help relax the page size trade-off so that address translation and demand\npaging optimizations work together synergistically. However, existing page\ncoalescing and splintering policies require costly base page migrations that\nundermine the benefits multiple page sizes provide. In this paper, we observe\nthat GPGPU applications present an opportunity to support multiple page sizes\nwithout costly data migration, as the applications perform most of their memory\nallocation en masse (i.e., they allocate a large number of base pages at once).\nWe show that this en masse allocation allows us to create intelligent memory\nallocation policies which ensure that base pages that are contiguous in virtual\nmemory are allocated to contiguous physical memory pages. As a result,\ncoalescing and splintering operations no longer need to migrate base pages.\n  We introduce Mosaic, a GPU memory manager that provides\napplication-transparent support for multiple page sizes. Mosaic uses base pages\nto transfer data over the system I/O bus, and allocates physical memory in a\nway that (1) preserves base page contiguity and (2) ensures that a large page\nframe contains pages from only a single memory protection domain.

We show that, under broad conditions, as we\nmake the architecture increasingly wide, the implied random function converges\nin distribution to a Gaussian process, formalising and extending existing\nresults by Neal (1996) to deep networks. To evaluate convergence rates\nempirically, we use maximum mean discrepancy.

This instability can drive the system away from its original path in\nfield space into a new inflationary attractor, a scenario that we dub\nsidetracked inflation.

Within the framework of this model, a Neptune-like\nperturber sculpts the orbital distribution of distant Kuiper Belt objects\nthrough a complex interplay of resonant and secular effects, such that in\naddition to perihelion-circulating objects, the surviving orbits get organized\ninto apsidally aligned and anti-aligned configurations with respect to Planet\nNine's orbit. In this work, we investigate the role of Kuiper Belt initial\nconditions on the evolution of the outer solar system using numerical\nsimulations. Intriguingly, we find that the final perihelion distance\ndistribution depends strongly on the primordial state of the system, and\ndemonstrate that a bimodal structure corresponding to the existence of both\naligned and anti-aligned clusters is only reproduced if the initial perihelion\ndistribution is assumed to extend well beyond $\\sim 36$ AU. The bimodality in\nthe final perihelion distance distribution is due to the existence of\npermanently stable objects, with the lower perihelion peak corresponding to the\nanti-aligned orbits and the higher perihelion peak corresponding to the aligned\norbits. We identify the mechanisms which enable the persistent stability of\nthese objects and locate the regions of phase space in which they reside. The\nobtained results contextualize the Planet Nine hypothesis within the broader\nnarrative of solar system formation, and offer further insight into the\nobservational search for Planet Nine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Thus, one of the major challenges\nin WSNs is to determine the coordinates of sensors while minimizing the\nhardware cost. To address this, numerous localization algorithms have been\nproposed in the literature. However, outcomes of these algorithms are affected\nby noise, fading, and interference. As a result, their levels of accuracy may\nbecome unacceptable in complex environments that contain obstacles and\nreflecting surfaces. The alternative is to use topological maps based only on\nconnectivity information. Since they do not contain information about physical\ndistances, however, they are not faithful representatives of the physical\nlayout. Thus, the primary goal of this research is to discover a topology map\nthat provides more accurate information about physical layouts. In doing so,\nthis research has resulted in four main contributions. First, a novel concept\nMaximum-Likelihood Topology Map for RF WSNs is presented. This topology map\nprovides a more accurate physical representation, by using the probability of\npacket reception. The second contribution is Millimetre wave Topology Map\ncalculation, which is a novel topology mapping algorithm based on maximum\nlikelihood estimation for millimetre wave WSNs. The third contribution is a\ndistributed algorithm being proposed to calculate the topology coordinates of\nsensors by themselves as two algorithms above calculate centrally, which\nrequires time. Since a topology map contains significant non-linear\ndistortions, two WSN applications i.e. target searching and extremum seeking,\nwhich use a proposed topology map to localize the sensors and perform its\nspecified task are presented as the final contribution of this dissertation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

It is expected that a trancitor coupled with a\ntransistor can provide a minimal circuit configuration, i.e., low circuit\ncomplexity, helping virtually to meet the Moore's law. And this may also lead\nto a lower power-consumption and higher speed of circuits compared to a\ntransistor-only circuit. These are supported with a circuit simulation and\nsimple Tetris-like block analysis. In this regards, in the future, it should be\nrequired to find a trancitor to be another foundation of electronics along with\ntransistors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 13:35:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 09:08:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 16:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 06:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 13:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 12:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 07:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

Change\nprovides opportunities for growth and innovation. Here we review patterns and\nprocesses that are responsible for a 'double tale' of evolutionary accretion at\nvarious levels of complexity, from proteins and nucleic acids to high-rise\nbuilding structures in cities. Parts are at first weakly linked and associate\nvariously. As they diversify, they compete with each other and are selected for\nperformance. The emerging interactions constrain their structure and\nassociations. This causes parts to self-organize into modules with tight\nlinkage. In a second phase, variants of the modules evolve and become new parts\nfor a new generative cycle of higher-level organization. Evolutionary genomics\nand network biology support the 'double tale' of structural module creation and\nvalidate an evolutionary principle of maximum abundance that drives the gain\nand loss of modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 02:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

For example, we show that incremental\ndeployability is at least as general a concept as the Nash equilibrium (in that\nthe latter can be derived from the former).

However, most existing bug detection\ntools ignore this information and therefore miss some classes of bugs. The few\nexisting name-based bug detection approaches reason about names on a syntactic\nlevel and rely on manually designed and tuned algorithms to detect bugs. This\npaper presents DeepBugs, a learning approach to name-based bug detection, which\nreasons about names based on a semantic representation and which automatically\nlearns bug detectors instead of manually writing them. We formulate bug\ndetection as a binary classification problem and train a classifier that\ndistinguishes correct from incorrect code. To address the challenge that\neffectively learning a bug detector requires examples of both correct and\nincorrect code, we create likely incorrect code examples from an existing\ncorpus of code through simple code transformations. A novel insight learned\nfrom our work is that learning from artificially seeded bugs yields bug\ndetectors that are effective at finding bugs in real-world code. We implement\nour idea into a framework for learning-based and name-based bug detection.\nThree bug detectors built on top of the framework detect accidentally swapped\nfunction arguments, incorrect binary operators, and incorrect operands in\nbinary operations. Applying the approach to a corpus of 150,000 JavaScript\nfiles yields bug detectors that have a high accuracy (between 89% and 95%), are\nvery efficient (less than 20 milliseconds per analyzed file), and reveal 102\nprogramming mistakes (with 68% true positive rate) in real-world code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 13:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}
