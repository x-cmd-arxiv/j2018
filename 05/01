However, the robustness of such neural networks is seldom\napprised, especially after high classification accuracy has been attained. In\nthis paper, we evaluate the robustness of three recurrent neural networks to\ntiny perturbations, on three widely used datasets, to argue that high accuracy\ndoes not always mean a stable and a robust (to bounded perturbations,\nadversarial attacks, etc.) system. Especially, normalizing the spectrum of the\ndiscrete recurrent network to bound the spectrum (using power method, Rayleigh\nquotient, etc.) on a unit disk produces stable, albeit highly non-robust neural\nnetworks. Furthermore, using the $\\epsilon$-pseudo-spectrum, we show that\ntraining of recurrent networks, say using gradient-based methods, often result\nin non-normal matrices that may or may not be diagonalizable. Therefore, the\nopen problem lies in constructing methods that optimize not only for accuracy\nbut also for the stability and the robustness of the underlying neural network,\na criterion that is distinct from the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 16:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

By\ntreating phonons and light classically and decoupling interactions to integrate\nout the fermionic degrees of freedom, we arrive at an effective theory of order\nparameter fluctuations about the spatially uniform saddle-point solution. We\nfind that, due to the $(k_x^2-k_y^2) (B_{1g})$ symmetry of the form factor\nappearing in the vertex, nematic fluctuations couple to light only at fourth\norder, unlike isotropic density fluctuations which couple at second order.\nHence, to lowest order, the interaction between electrons and the\nelectromagnetic field contributes a driving force for plasmon oscillations\nwhile it provides a frequency shift for nematic fluctuations. From the\nresulting coupled harmonic oscillator equations of motion, we argue that\nultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy could be a useful tool to extract and\nanalyze various electronic properties of interest such as the frequency of the\ncollective mode and the coupling between electrons and phonons.

The method's accuracy is tested in nearly 300\nexperiments using simulated galaxy maps, showing that it is capable of\nconstraining the molecular cloud lifetime and feedback time-scale to $<0.1$ dex\nprecision. Access to the evolutionary timeline provides a variety of additional\nphysical quantities, such as the cloud-scale star formation efficiency, the\nfeedback outflow velocity, the mass loading factor, and the feedback energy or\nmomentum coupling efficiencies to the ambient medium. We show that the results\nare robust for a wide variety of gas and star formation tracers, spatial\nresolutions, galaxy inclinations, and galaxy sizes. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat our method can be applied out to high redshift ($z\\lesssim4$) with a\nfeasible time investment on current large-scale observatories. This is a major\nshift from previous studies that constrained the physics of star formation and\nfeedback in the immediate vicinity of the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 09:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

However, since the proto-Earth\nhas experienced many giant-impacts, several moons are naturally expected to\nform through a sequence of multiple (including smaller scale) impacts. Each\nimpact potentially forms a sub-Lunar mass moonlet that interacts\ngravitationally with the proto-Earth and possibly with previously-formed\nmoonlets. Such interactions result in either moonlet-moonlet mergers, moonlet\nejections or infall of moonlets on the Earth. The latter possibility, leading\nto low-velocity moonlet-Earth collisions is explored here for the first time.\nWe make use of SPH simulations and consider a range of moonlet masses,\ncollision impact-angles and initial proto-Earth rotation rates. We find that\ngrazing/tidal-collisions are the most frequent and produce comparable fractions\nof accreted-material and debris. The latter typically clump in smaller moonlets\nthat can potentially later interact with other moonlets. Other collision\ngeometries are more rare.

Our contribution is threefold.\nFirst, we formulate the quality decisions of video chunks constrained by the\navailable bandwidth, the playback buffer, and the chunk deadlines as an\noptimization problem. The objective is to optimize a novel QoE metric that\nmodels a combination of the three objectives of minimizing the stall/skip\nduration of the video, maximizing the playback quality of every chunk, and\nminimizing the number of quality switches. Second, we develop Layered Bin\nPacking (LBP) Adaptation Algorithm, a novel algorithm that solves the proposed\noptimization problem. Moreover, we show that LBP achieves the optimal solution\nof the proposed optimization problem with linear complexity in the number of\nvideo chunks. Third, we propose an online algorithm (online LBP) where several\nchallenges are addressed including handling bandwidth prediction errors, and\nshort prediction duration. Extensive simulations with real bandwidth traces of\npublic datasets reveal the robustness of our scheme and demonstrate its\nsignificant performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art SVC\nstreaming algorithms.

However, the short lags can also be produced by reflection\nfrom more distant material, because the primary photons with no time-delay\ndilute the time-lags caused by the reprocessed photons.

We prepare\ntwo-component mixtures of varying relative population and implement a disorder\npotential which is only experienced by one of the components. The second\nnon-disordered ''clean'' component plays the role of a bath of adjustable size\nthat is collisionally coupled to the ''dirty'' component. Our experiments show\nhow the dynamics of the dirty component, which, when on its own, show strong\nevidence of localization, become affected by the coupling to the clean\ncomponent. For a high clean population, the clean component appears to behave\nas an effective bath for the system which leads to its delocalization, while\nfor a smaller clean population, the ability of the bath to destabilize the\nsystem becomes strongly reduced. Our results reveal how a finite-sized quantum\nsystem can bring another one towards thermalization, in a regime of complex\ninterplay between disorder, tunneling and intercomponent interactions.

For the special case of optimizing\naverage rank for linear ranking functions, however, the recently developed\nSVM-PropRank method has shown that counterfactual inference techniques can be\nused to provably overcome the distorting effect of presentation bias. Going\nbeyond this special case, this paper provides a general and theoretically\nrigorous framework for counterfactual learning-to-rank that enables unbiased\ntraining for a broad class of additive ranking metrics (e.g., Discounted\nCumulative Gain (DCG)) as well as a broad class of models (e.g., deep\nnetworks). Specifically, we derive a relaxation for propensity-weighted\nrank-based metrics which is subdifferentiable and thus suitable for\ngradient-based optimization.

But as Reynolds himself later showed, his theory can only be\nformalized in a meta-theory with an impredicative universe, such as the\nCalculus of Inductive Constructions. Abstracting from Reynolds' ideas, Dunphy\nand Reddy developed their well-known framework for parametricity that uses\nparametric limits in reflexive graph categories and aims to subsume a variety\nof parametric models. As we observe, however, their theory is not sufficiently\ngeneral to subsume the very model that inspired parametricity, namely Reynolds'\noriginal model, expressed inside type theory. To correct this, we develop an\nabstract framework for relational parametricity that generalizes the notion of\na reflexive graph categories and delivers Reynolds' model as a direct instance\nin a natural way. This framework is uniform with respect to a choice of\nmeta-theory, which allows us to obtain the well-known PER model of Longo and\nMoggi as a direct instance in a natural way as well. In addition, we offer two\nnovel relationally parametric models of System F: i) a categorical version of\nReynolds' model, where types are functorial on isomorphisms and all polymorphic\nfunctions respect the functorial action, and ii) a proof-relevant categorical\nversion of Reynolds' model (after Orsanigo), where, additionally, witnesses of\nrelatedness are themselves suitably related. We show that, unlike previously\nexisting frameworks for parametricity, ours recognizes both of these new models\nin a natural way. Our framework is thus descriptive, in that it accounts for\nwell-known models, as well as prescriptive, in that it identifies abstract\nproperties that good models of relational parametricity should satisfy and\nsuggests new constructions of such models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 19:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 16:22:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 17:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on\nCPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or\ncode-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks).\nUnfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime\ndata-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics\nchecking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for\ndefending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution\nsemantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical\nexecution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the\nphysical context and program control flows), including the event identification\nand dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new\nprogram behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA).\neFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and\nincorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented\nexploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding\nevent dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by\nconducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can\nsuccessfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi\nincurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity\nchecking, and 0.063s~0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency\nchecking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 19:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 02:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

Beam position was measured using the Spot Position Monitor (SPM),\na multi-wire proportional counter (MWPC) in the nozzle approximately 0.5 meters\nupstream of the treatment isocenter. Measured beam positions as a function of\nmomentum offset were fitted to a linear function to extract dispersion. In one\ngantry, dispersions for 70 and 140 MeV beams were also measured. Because spot\nposition is continuously monitored during treatments and a position deviation\nwill abort the beam delivery, the dispersion at the spot position monitor was\nused to set an upper limit of range uncertainty originating from momentum\ndeviation. When dispersion was approximately zero, dose rate measurements were\nused to set an upper limit of momentum deviation that could reach the patient.\n  Results: Dispersion was 0.45 m, 0.48 m and 0.30 m for 70 MeV, 140 MeV, and\n230 MeV beams in a gantry, respectively, corresponding to 0.3 mm, 1.0 mm and\n3.5 mm maximum range uncertainty during treatments.

Most of them have weaker than expected spectral features\nin the $1.1-1.7\\mu m$ bandpass probed by HST/WFC3 but stronger spectral\nfeatures at longer wavelengths probed by Spitzer. This led previous authors to\npuzzling conclusions about the thermal structures and chemical abundances of\nthese planets. Using the SPARC/MITgcm, we investigate how thermal dissociation,\nionization, H$^-$ opacity and clouds shape the thermal structures and spectral\nproperties of ultra hot Jupiters with a special focus on WASP-121b. We expand\nour findings to the whole population of ultra hot Jupiters through analytical\nquantification of the thermal dissociation and its influence on the strength of\nspectral features.\n  We predict that most molecules are thermally dissociated and alkalies are\nionized in the dayside photospheres of ultra hot Jupiters. This includes\nH$_{\\rm 2}$O, TiO, VO, and H$_{\\rm 2}$ but not CO, which has a stronger\nmolecular bond. The vertical molecular gradient created by the dissociation\nsignificantly weakens the spectral features from water while the $4.5\\mu m$ CO\nfeature remain unchanged. The water band in the HST/WFC3 bandpass is further\nweakened by H$^-$ continuum opacity. Molecules are expected to recombine before\nreaching the limb, leading to order of magnitude variations of the chemical\ncomposition and cloud coverage between the limb and the dayside. Overall,\nmolecular dissociation provides a qualitative understanding of the lack of\nstrong spectral feature of water in the $1-2\\mu m$ bandpass observed in most\nultra hot Jupiters. Quantitatively, however, our model does not provide a\nsatisfactory match to the WASP-121b emission spectrum. Together with WASP-33b\nand Kepler-33Ab, they seem the outliers among the population of ultra hot\nJupiters in need of a more thorough understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 20:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 09:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

A subclass of\nsoft fluid-driven actuators known as fiber reinforced elastomeric enclosures\n(FREEs) is particularly well suited as actuators for these types of systems.\nFREEs are inherently soft and can impart spatial forces without imposing a\nrigid structure. Furthermore, they can be configured to produce a large variety\nof force and moment combinations. In this paper we explore the potential of\ncombining multiple differently configured FREEs in parallel to achieve fully\ncontrollable multi-dimensional soft actuation. To this end, we propose a novel\nmethodology to represent and calculate the generalized forces generated by soft\nactuators as a function of their internal pressure. This methodology relies on\nthe notion of a state dependent fluid Jacobian that yields a linear expression\nfor force. We employ this concept to construct the set of all possible forces\nthat can be generated by a soft system in a given state. This force zonotope\ncan be used to inform the design and control of parallel combinations of soft\nactuators. The approach is verified experimentally with the parallel\ncombination of three carefully designed actuators constrained to a 2DOF testing\nrig. The force predictions matched measured values with a root-mean-square\nerror of less than 1.5 N force and 8 x 10^(-3)Nm moment, demonstrating the\nutility of the presented methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 22:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 17:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

In a centralized setting where the\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) is unknown, the empirical CDF (ECDF) can\nbe used to estimate such quantiles after aggregating the data. In a fully\ndistributed sensor network, however, it is challenging to estimate quantiles.\nThis is because each sensor node observes local measurement data with limited\nstorage and data transmission power which make it difficult to obtain the\nglobal ECDF. This paper proposes consensus-based quantile estimation for such a\ndistributed network. The states of the proposed algorithm are recursively\nupdated with two-steps at each iteration: one is a local update based on the\nmeasurement data and the current state, and the other is averaging the updated\nstates with neighboring nodes. We consider the realistic case of communication\nlinks between nodes being corrupted by independent random noise. It is shown\nthat the estimated state sequence is asymptotically unbiased and converges\ntoward the sample quantile in the mean-square sense. The two step-size\nsequences corresponding to the averaging and local update steps result in a\nmixed-time scale algorithm with proper decay rates in order to achieve\nconvergence.

We\nmodel incomplete functional programs as expressions with holes, with empty\nholes standing for missing expressions or types, and non-empty holes operating\nas membranes around static and dynamic type inconsistencies. Rather than\naborting when evaluation encounters any of these holes as in some existing\nsystems, evaluation proceeds around holes, tracking the closure around each\nhole instance as it flows through the remainder of the program.

The efficient load-balancing design is strongly\nneeded for supporting high-quality wireless connections in high-density areas.\nDespite the presence of a variety of earlier works on the design and analysis\nof the load-balancing schemes in wireless networks, there does not exist a work\non the load-balancing design in the realistic flow-level dynamic model.\n  In this work, we propose a Join-the-Least-Workload (JLW) Algorithm that\nalways forwards the incoming flows to the AP with the smallest workload in the\npresence of flow-level dynamics. However, our considered flow-level dynamic\nmodel differs from traditional queueing model for wireless networks in the\nfollowing two aspects: (1) the dynamics of the flows is short-term and flows\nwill leave the network once they received the desired amount of service; (2)\neach individual flow faces an independent channel fading. These differences\npose significant challenges on the system performance analysis. To tackle these\nchallenges, we perform Lyapunov-drift-based analysis of the stochastic network\ntaking into account sharp flow-level dynamics. Our analysis reveals that our\nproposed JLW Algorithm not only achieves maximum system throughput, but also\nminimizes the total system workload in heavy-traffic regimes. Moreover, we\nobserve from both our theoretical and simulation results that the mean total\nworkload performance under the proposed JLW Algorithm does not degrade as the\nnumber of APs increases, which is strongly desirable in high-density wireless\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 02:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

The goal is to reconstruct an x-ray spectrum that can accurately model\nthe x-ray transmission curves and reflects a realistic shape of the typical\nenergy spectra of the CT system. To this end, spectrum estimation is posed as\nan optimization problem with x-ray spectrum as unknown variables, and a\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint is employed to incorporate prior\nknowledge of the spectrum and enhance numerical stability of the estimation\nprocess. The formulated constrained optimization problem is convex and can be\nsolved efficiently by use of the exponentiated-gradient (EG) algorithm. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the simulated and\nexperimental data. The comparison to the expectation-maximization (EM) method\nis also discussed. In simulations, the proposed algorithm is seen to yield\nx-ray spectra that closely match the ground truth and represent the attenuation\nprocess of x-ray photons in materials, both included and not included in the\nestimation process. In experiments, the calculated transmission curve is in\ngood agreement with the measured transmission curve, and the estimated spectra\nexhibits physically realistic looking shapes. The results further show the\ncomparable performance between the proposed optimization-based approach and EM.\nIn conclusion, our formulation of a constrained optimization provides an\ninterpretable and flexible framework for spectrum estimation. Moreover, a\nKL-divergence constraint can include a prior spectrum and appears to capture\nimportant features of x-ray spectrum, allowing accurate and robust estimation\nof x-ray spectrum in CT imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 02:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

However, its application to small quantum systems suffers from two\ncardinal problems: (i) The Clausius inequality does not hold when the system\nand environment are initially correlated - a commonly encountered scenario in\nmicroscopic setups. (ii) In some other cases, the Clausius inequality does not\nprovide any useful information (e.g. in dephasing scenarios). We address these\ndeficiencies by developing the notion of global passivity and employing it as a\ntool for deriving thermodynamic inequalities on observables. For initially\nuncorrelated thermal environments the global passivity framework recovers the\nClausius inequality. More generally, global passivity provides an extension of\nthe Clausius inequality that holds even in the presences of strong initial\nsystem-environment correlations. Crucially, the present framework provides\nadditional thermodynamic bounds on expectation values. To illustrate the role\nof the additional bounds we use them to detect unaccounted heat leaks and weak\nfeedback operations (\"Maxwell's demons\") that the Clausius inequality cannot\ndetect. In addition, it is shown that global passivity can put practical upper\nand lower bounds on the buildup of system-environment correlation for dephasing\ninteractions.

In this paper we analyse the local scaling\nproperties of the lateral temperature structure functions in the BLs of this\nsimulation of 2D RB, employing extended self-similarity (ESS) (i.e., plotting\nthe structure functions against each other, rather than only against the scale)\nin the spirit of the attached eddy hypothesis, as we have recently introduced\nfor velocity structure functions in wall turbulence (Krug \\textit{et al.},\n\\textit{J.

In striking\ncorrespondence to the $Nu$ scaling, the ESS scaling region is negligible at $Ra\n= 10^{11}$ and well developed at $Ra = 10^{14}$, thus providing strong evidence\nthat the observed transition in the global Nusselt number at $Ra \\approx\n10^{13}$ indeed is the transition from a laminar type BL to a turbulent type\nBL.

This is\nachieved by using entity and template seeds jointly (as opposed to just one as\nin previous work), by expanding entities and templates in parallel and in a\nmutually constraining fashion in each iteration and by introducing\nhigherquality similarity measures for templates. Experimental results show that\nBREX achieves an F1 that is 0.13 (0.87 vs. 0.74) better than the state of the\nart for four relationships.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 09:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

Through an observation, we find that principle\ncomponent analysis (PCA) can be used to characterise fitness landscapes.

In\norder to verify the effectiveness of PCA-projection, we design two algorithms\nenhanced with PCA-projection for solving constrained optimization problems,\ncalled PMODE and HECO-PDE, respectively.

This should have the benefit of not only giving simpler semantics\nand proofs of properties such as adequacy, but also hopefully in the future to\nscale to languages with advanced features, such as general references, outside\nthe reach of traditional domain theoretic techniques. Working in Guarded\nDependent Type Theory (GDTT), we develop denotational semantics for FPC, the\nsimply typed lambda calculus extended with recursive types, modelling the\nrecursive types of FPC using the guarded recursive types of GDTT. We prove\nsoundness and computational adequacy of the model in GDTT using a logical\nrelation between syntax and semantics constructed also using guarded recursive\ntypes. The denotational semantics is intensional in the sense that it counts\nthe number of unfold-fold reductions needed to compute the value of a term, but\nwe construct a relation relating the denotations of extensionally equal terms,\ni.e., pairs of terms that compute the same value in a different number of\nsteps. Finally we show how the denotational semantics of terms can be executed\ninside type theory and prove that executing the denotation of a boolean term\ncomputes the same value as the operational semantics of FPC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 12:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 12:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-07"}

Current\nmethods to achieve this goal rely on matching the data with a superposition of\nexponentially damped sinusoids with amplitudes fitted to numerical-relativity\n(NR) simulations of binary black-hole (BBH) mergers. These models presume the\nability to correctly estimate the time at which the gravitational-wave (GW)\nsignal starts to be dominated by the QNMs of a perturbed BH. Here we show that\nthis difficulty can be overcome by using multipolar inspiral-merger-ringdown\nwaveforms, calibrated to NR simulations, as already developed within the\neffective-one-body formalism (EOBNR).

Recent research has shown that about 75 percent of protests that\nare regarded as legal, are planned in advance. Twitter, the prominent\nmicro-blogging website, has been used as a tool by protestors for planning,\norganizing, and announcing many of the recent protests worldwide such as those\nthat led to the Arab Spring, Britain riots, and those against Mr. Trump after\nthe presidential election in the U.S. In this paper, we aim to predict protests\nby means of machine learning algorithms.

The numerical simulations and theoretical analyses\nboth indicate that there is a first-order phase transition in the spreading\ndynamics, and that a hysteresis loop emerges in the system when there is a\nvariety of initially-adopted seeds.

Currently, applications using CNN\nalgorithms are deployed mainly on general purpose hardwares, such as CPUs, GPUs\nor FPGAs. However, power consumption, speed, accuracy, memory footprint, and\ndie size should all be taken into consideration for mobile and embedded\napplications. Domain Specific Architecture (DSA) for CNN is the efficient and\npractical solution for CNN deployment and implementation. We designed and\nproduced a 28nm Two-Dimensional CNN-DSA accelerator with an ultra\npower-efficient performance of 9.3TOPS/Watt and with all processing done in the\ninternal memory instead of outside DRAM. It classifies 224x224 RGB image inputs\nat more than 140fps with peak power consumption at less than 300mW and an\naccuracy comparable to the VGG benchmark. The CNN-DSA accelerator is\nreconfigurable to support CNN model coefficients of various layer sizes and\nlayer types, including convolution, depth-wise convolution, short-cut\nconnections, max pooling, and ReLU. Furthermore, in order to better support\nreal-world deployment for various application scenarios, especially with\nlow-end mobile and embedded platforms and MCUs (Microcontroller Units), we also\ndesigned algorithms to fully utilize the CNN-DSA accelerator efficiently by\nreducing the dependency on external accelerator computation resources,\nincluding implementation of Fully-Connected (FC) layers within the accelerator\nand compression of extracted features from the CNN-DSA accelerator. Live demos\nwith our CNN-DSA accelerator on mobile and embedded systems show its\ncapabilities to be widely and practically applied in the real world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 17:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

The main objective,\nhowever, is to transfer this model to a target domain and task. Currently, the\nmost effective transfer strategy is fine-tuning, which restricts one to use the\nsame model or parts thereof for both pretext and target tasks. In this paper,\nwe present a novel framework for self-supervised learning that overcomes\nlimitations in designing and comparing different tasks, models, and data\ndomains. In particular, our framework decouples the structure of the\nself-supervised model from the final task-specific fine-tuned model. This\nallows us to: 1) quantitatively assess previously incompatible models including\nhandcrafted features; 2) show that deeper neural network models can learn\nbetter representations from the same pretext task; 3) transfer knowledge\nlearned with a deep model to a shallower one and thus boost its learning. We\nuse this framework to design a novel self-supervised task, which achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the common benchmarks in PASCAL VOC 2007,\nILSVRC12 and Places by a significant margin. Our learned features shrink the\nmAP gap between models trained via self-supervised learning and supervised\nlearning from 5.9% to 2.6% in object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 15:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

This duality calls for an\nindependent validation of compartment axial diffusivities, to determine which\nof the two cases holds. The aim of the present study was to use an\nintracerebroventricular injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent to\nselectively reduce the extracellular water signal in the rat brain, and compare\ndiffusion metrics in the genu of the corpus callosum before and after\ngadolinium infusion.

A strong decrease in genu T1 and T2\nrelaxation times post-Gd was observed (p < 0.001), as well as an increase of\n48% in radial kurtosis (p < 0.05), which implies that the relative fraction of\nextracellular water signal was selectively decreased.

While these interviews are crucial\nto understanding the \"peculiar institution\" from the standpoint of the slave\nhimself, issues relating to bias cloud analyses of these interviews. The\nproblem I investigate is the problem of candour in the WPA slave narratives: it\nis widely held in the historical community that the strict racial caste system\nof the Deep South compelled black ex-slaves to tell white interviewers what\nthey thought they wanted to hear, suggesting that there was a significant\ndifference candour depending on whether their interviewer was white or black.\nIn this work, I attempt to quantitatively characterise this race-related\nproblem of candour. Prior work has either been of an impressionistic,\nqualitative nature, or utilised exceedingly simple quantitative methodology. In\ncontrast, I use more sophisticated statistical methods: in particular word\nfrequency and sentiment analysis and comparative topic modelling with LDA to\ntry and identify differences in the content and sentiment expressed by\nex-slaves in front of white interviewers versus black interviewers. While my\nsentiment analysis methodology was ultimately unsuccessful due to the\ncomplexity of the task, my word frequency analysis and comparative topic\nmodelling methods both showed strong evidence that the content expressed in\nfront of white interviewers was different from that of black interviewers. In\nparticular, I found that the ex-slaves spoke much more about unfavourable\naspects of slavery like whipping and slave patrollers in front of interviewers\nof their own race. I hope that my more-sophisticated statistical methodology\nhelps improve the robustness of the argument for the existence of this problem\nof candour in the slave narratives, which some would seek to deny for\nrevisionist purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 05:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

The maximum likelihood analysis has been reviewed to obtain the\nconstraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the model parameter $n$ by taking\ninto account the observational Hubble data set $H(z)$, the Union 2.1\ncompilation data set $SNeIa$, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data $BAO$, and\nthe joint data set $H(z)$ + $ SNeIa$ and $H(z)$ + $SNeIa$ + $BAO $. It is\ndemonstrated that the model is in good agreement with various observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 08:21:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 12:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

For this reason, we introduce the\naxial momentum operator, $ - i \\gamma_5 \\nabla$ as a new observable for this\nparticle. In the Heisenberg picture, the axial momentum contains a component\nwhich oscillates with the amplitude proportional to $m/E$, where $E$ is the\nenergy and $m$ the mass of the particle. The presence of the oscillations\ndiscriminates between the massive and massless Majorana particle. We show how\nthe eigenvectors of the axial momentum, called the axial plane waves, can be\nused as a basis for obtaining the general solution of the evolution equation,\nalso in the case of free Majorana field. Here a novel feature is a coupling of\nmodes with the opposite momenta, again present only in the case of massive\nparticle or field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 13:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 12:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

This paper investigates various\npre- and post-processing techniques for improving the performance of U-Nets as\nmeasured by the Jaccard Index. The dataset provided as part of the \"2017 ISBI\nChallenges on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection\" was used for\nthis evaluation and the performance of the finalist competitors was the\nstandard for comparison. The pre-processing techniques employed in the proposed\nsystem included contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and vignette\ncorrection. More advanced image transformations, such as local binary patterns\nand wavelet decomposition, were also employed to augment the raw grayscale\nimages used as network input features. While the performance of the proposed\nsystem fell short of the winners of the challenge, it was determined that using\nwavelet decomposition as an early transformation step improved the overall\nperformance of the system over pre- and post-processing steps alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}
