However,\nexisting depth-image-based face recognition methods still suffer from noisy\ndepth values and varying poses and expressions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method for normalizing facial depth images to frontal pose and neutral\nexpression and extracting robust features from the normalized depth images. The\nmethod is implemented via two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN),\nnormalization network ($Net_{N}$) and feature extraction network ($Net_{F}$).\nGiven a facial depth image, $Net_{N}$ first converts it to an HHA image, from\nwhich the 3D face is reconstructed via a DCNN. $Net_{N}$ then generates a\npose-and-expression normalized (PEN) depth image from the reconstructed 3D\nface. The PEN depth image is finally passed to $Net_{F}$, which extracts a\nrobust feature representation via another DCNN for face recognition. Our\npreliminary evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nmethod in recognizing faces of arbitrary poses and expressions with depth\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 16:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-02"}

We modeled these data with a 3D GCM and 1D\nself-consistent forward models. The 1D models indicate that the atmosphere has\na thermal inversion, weak heat redistribution, and water dissociation that\nlimits the range of pressures probed. This result suggests that WFC3\nobservations of HAT-P-7b and possibly some other ultra-hot Jupiters appear\nblackbody-like because they probe a region near the tropopause where the\natmospheric temperature changes slowly with pressure. Additionally, the 1D\nmodels constrain the atmospheric metallicity\n($[\\text{M/H}]=-0.87^{+0.38}_{-0.34}$) and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O $<1$\nat 99 % confidence). The solar composition 3D GCM matches the Spitzer data but\ngenerally underpredicts the flux in the WFC3 bandpass and cannot reproduce its\nfeatureless shape. This discrepancy could be explained by high atmospheric drag\nor nightside clouds, and may be better understood through further observation\nwith the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 16:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

This equation is an\nextension of the equation that describes dynamics in Kerr-nonlinear ring\nresonators, referred to as the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) due to its\nformulation by Lugiato and Lefever in 1987. We use the new equation to study\nthe properties of Kerr frequency combs in FP resonators. The derivation of the\nequation starts from the set of Maxwell-Bloch equations that govern the\ndynamics of the forward and backward propagating envelopes of the electric\nfield coupled to the atomic polarization and population difference variables in\na FP cavity. The final equation is formulated in terms of an auxiliary field\n$\\psi(z,t)$ that evolves over a slow time $t$ on the domain $-L \\leq z \\leq L$\nwith periodic boundary conditions, where $L$ is the cavity length. We describe\nhow the forward and backward propagating field envelopes are obtained after\nsolving the equation for $\\psi$. This formulation makes the comparison between\nthe FP and ring geometries straightforward. The FP equation includes an\nadditional nonlinear term relative to the LLE for the ring cavity, with the\neffect that the value of the detuning parameter $\\alpha$ of the ring LLE is\nincreased by twice the average of $|\\psi|^2$.

Eight of the high energy, old halo GCs are strongly clumped in\nazimuthal and vertical action, yet strung out like beads on a chain at extreme\nradial action. They are very radially anisotropic ($\\beta \\sim 0.95$) and move\non orbits that are all highly eccentric ($e \\gtrsim 0.80$). They also form a\ntrack in the age-metallicity plane distinct from the bulk of the Milky Way GCs\nand compatible with a dwarf spheroidal origin.

It affects planet formation, vertical settling and is one possible\norigin of the large scale axisymmetric structures, such as rings, recently\nimaged by ALMA and SPHERE. Among the variety of MHD processes, the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) has raised particular interest since it\nprovides a source of turbulence and potentially organizes the flow into radial\nstructures. However, the weak ionization of discs prevents the MRI from being\nexcited beyond 1 AU. The strong sedimentation of millimetre dust measured in\nT-Tauri discs is also in contradiction with predictions based on ideal MRI\nturbulence. In this paper, we study the effects of non-ideal MHD and winds on\nthe dynamics and sedimentation of dust grains. We consider a weakly ionized\nplasma subject to ambipolar diffusion characterizing the disc outer regions (>1\nAU). For that, we perform numerical MHD simulations in the stratified shearing\nbox, using the PLUTO code. Our simulations show that the mm-cm dust is\ncontained vertically in a very thin layer, with typical heightscale ~0.4 AU at\n30 AU, compatible with recent ALMA observations. Horizontally, the grains are\ntrapped within pressure maxima induced by ambipolar diffusion, leading to the\nformation of dust rings. For micrometer grains, dust and gas scaleheights are\nsimilar. In this regime, the settling cannot be explained by a simple 1D\ndiffusion theory but results from a large scale 2D circulation induced by both\nMHD winds and zonal flows. Overall, our results show that non-ideal MHD effects\nand their related winds play a major role in shaping the radial and vertical\ndistribution of dust in protoplanetary discs. Leading to substantial accretion\nefficiency, non-ideal effects also a promising avenue to reconcile the low\nturbulent activity measured in discs with their relatively high accretion\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 17:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Spinning dust is one variety of AME that\ncould be partially polarized and therefore relevant for ongoing and future\ncosmic microwave background polarization studies. The Planck satellite mission\nidentified candidate AME regions in approximately $1^\\circ$ patches that were\nfound to have spectra generally consistent with spinning dust grain models. The\nspectra for one of these regions, G107.2+5.2, was also consistent with\noptically thick free-free emission because of a lack of measurements between 2\nand 20 GHz. Follow-up observations were needed. Therefore, we used the C-band\nreceiver (4 to 8 GHz) and the VEGAS spectrometer at the Green Bank Telescope to\nconstrain the AME mechanism. For the study described in this paper, we produced\nthree band averaged maps at 4.575, 5.625, and 6.125 GHz and used aperture\nphotometry to measure the spectral flux density in the region relative to the\nbackground. We found if the spinning dust description is correct, then the\nspinning dust signal peaks at $30.9 \\pm 1.4$ GHz, and it explains the excess\nemission. The morphology and spectrum together suggest the spinning dust grains\nare concentrated near S140, which is a star forming region inside our chosen\nphotometry aperture.

We\nhave undertaken a multiwavelength study of a young, bipolar H II region in the\nGalactic disc, G$316.81-0.06$, which lies at the centre of a massive\n($\\sim10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$) infrared-dark cloud filament. It is still accreting\nmolecular gas as well as driving a $\\sim 0.2$ pc ionised gas outflow\nperpendicular to the filament. Intriguingly, we observe a large velocity\ngradient ($47.81 \\pm 3.21$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$) across the ionised gas in a\ndirection perpendicular to the outflow. This kinematic signature of the ionised\ngas shows a reasonable correspondence with the simulations of young H II\nregions.

If the velocity gradient perpendicular to the\noutflow is caused by rotation of the ionised gas, then we infer that this\nrotation is a direct result of the initial net angular momentum in the natal\nmolecular cloud. If this explanation is correct, this kinematic signature\nshould be common in other young (bipolar) H II regions. We suggest that further\nquantitative analysis of the ionised gas kinematics of young H II regions,\ncombined with additional simulations, should improve our understanding of\nfeedback at these early stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

Methods: Cancer was induced within the sciatic nerves of male\nCopenhagen rats, and tissues from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were collected and\nused for measurements of immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The TRPV1\nantagonist capsazepine, the selective TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 and the\ncalcium ions inhibitor ruthenium red were used to treat thermal and/or\nmechanical hyperalgesia. Results: Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1\nshowed a lower expression in DRGs on days 7 and 14.

In the nested LESO, the\ninner-loop LESO actively estimates and eliminates the generalized disturbance.\nIncreasing the bandwidth improves the estimation accuracy which may tolerate\nnoise and conflict with H/W limitations and the sampling frequency of the\nsystem. Therefore, an alternative scenario is offered without increasing the\nbandwidth of the inner-loop LESO provided that the rate of change of the\ngeneralized disturbance estimation error is upper bounded. This is achieved by\nthe placing an outer-loop LESO in parallel with the inner one, it estimates and\neliminates the remaining generalized disturbance that eluded from the\ninner-loop LESO due to bandwidth limitations. The stability of LESO and nested\nLESO is investigated using Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulations on\nuncertain nonlinear SISO system with time-varying exogenous disturbance\nrevealed that the proposed nested LESO can successfully deal with a generalized\ndisturbance in both noisy and noise-free environments, where the Integral Time\nAbsolute Error (ITAE) of the tracking error for the nested LESO is reduced by\n69.87% from that of the LESO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 18:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 11:35:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 23:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

This lets the slice flow through shadows. To aid in\ndeveloping intuition for these slices, many explicit examples of holographic\nslices are investigated. Finally, the relationship to tensor networks and\nrenormalization (particularly in AdS/CFT) is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 19:28:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 17:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 05:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

A main technique to theoretically understand\nearly-warning signs for tipping points is to use the framework of fast-slow\nstochastic differential equations. A key assumption in many arguments for the\nexistence of variance and auto-correlation growth before a tipping point is to\nuse a linearization argument, i.e., the leading-order term governing the\ndeterministic (or drift) part of stochastic differential equation is linear.\nThis assumption guarantees a local approximation via an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess in the normally hyperbolic regime before, but sufficiently bounded away\nfrom, a bifurcation. In this paper, we generalize the situation to\nleading-order nonlinear terms for the setting of one fast variable.

In\nthis extended abstract, we explore methods to localize flexibly image regions\nfrom the top-down signal (in a form of one-hot label or natural languages) with\na weakly supervised attention learning mechanism. In our model, two types of\nmodules are utilized: a backbone module for visual feature capturing, and an\nattentive module generating maps based on regularized bilinear pooling. We\nconstruct the model in an end-to-end fashion which is trained by encouraging\nthe spatial attentive map to shift and focus on the region that consists of the\nbest matched visual features with the top-down signal. We demonstrate the\npreliminary yet promising results on a testbed that is synthesized with\nmulti-label MNIST data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 20:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

A solution to this problem in vision relied on\ncharacterizing receptor responses to different wavelengths of light and\nsubsequently relating these responses to perception. In olfaction,\nexperimentally measuring receptor responses to a representative set of complex\nmixtures is intractable due to the vast number of possibilities. To meet this\nchallenge, we develop a biophysical model that predicts mammalian receptor\nresponses to complex mixtures using responses to single odorants.

However, the thermal\ntransport properties of h-BN, which can be critical for device reliability and\nfunctionality, are little studied both experimentally and theoretically. The\nprimary challenge in the experimental measurements of the anisotropic thermal\nconductivity of h-BN is that typically sample size of h-BN single crystals is\ntoo small for conventional measurement techniques, as state-of-the-art\ntechnologies synthesize h-BN single crystals with lateral sizes only up to 2.5\nmm and thickness up to 200 {\\mu}m. Recently developed time-domain\nthermoreflectance (TDTR) techniques are suitable to measure the anisotropic\nthermal conductivity of such small samples, as it only requires a small area of\n50x50 {\\mu}m2 for the measurements. Accurate atomistic modeling of thermal\ntransport in bulk h-BN is also challenging due to the highly anisotropic\nlayered structure. Here we conduct an integrated experimental and theoretical\nstudy on the anisotropic thermal conductivity of bulk h-BN single crystals over\nthe temperature range of 100 K to 500 K, using TDTR measurements with multiple\nmodulation frequencies and a full-scale numerical calculation of the phonon\nBoltzmann transport equation starting from the first principles. Our\nexperimental and numerical results compare favorably for both the in-plane and\nthrough-plane thermal conductivities. We observe unusual temperature-dependence\nand phonon-isotope scattering in the through-plane thermal conductivity of h-BN\nand elucidate their origins. This work not only provides an important benchmark\nof the anisotropic thermal conductivity of h-BN but also develops fundamental\ninsights into the nature of phonon transport in this highly anisotropic layered\nmaterial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 21:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The\nlatter is the signature of energetic photons reprocessed by the optically thick\nmaterial of an accretion disk. Given their abundance and fluorescence yield,\nthe iron K-shell lines are the most prominent features in the X-ray reflected\nspectrum. Their line profiles can be grossly broadened and skewed by Doppler\neffects and gravitational redshift. Consequently, modeling the reflection\nspectrum provides one of the best methods to measure, among other physical\nquantities, the black-hole spin. At present the accuracy of the spin estimates\nis called into question because the data fits require very high iron\nabundances: typically several times the solar value. Concurrently no plausible\nphysical explanation has been proffered for these black-hole systems to be so\niron rich. The most likely explanation for the supersolar iron abundances is\nmodel shortfall at very high densities ($>10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$) due to atomic\ndata shortcomings in this regime. We review the current observational evidence\nfor the iron supersolar abundance in many black-hole systems, and show the\neffects of high density in state-of-the-art reflection models. We also briefly\ndiscuss our current efforts to produce new atomic data for high-density\nplasmas, which are required to refine the photoionization models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 00:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

To solve this problem, we propose a novel scheme for\ndeciding whether a context switch produces destructive or constructive\ninterference.

Following up on recent experimental studies, we\nnumerically study the occurrence of Anderson localization in plasmonic systems\nat terahertz frequencies. The low losses in the material at these frequencies\nallow us to separately quantify the localization length and the loss length in\nthe system. We measure a non-monotonic variation of loss length as a function\nof disorder, and attribute it to the participation ratio of the localized modes\nand resulting light occupancy in the metal. Next, we identify a unique behavior\nof the gap state frequencies and the density of states under disorder. We\nobserve that the maximally displaced gap state frequencies have a propensity to\nremain pinned to the frequency of the gap center. Even under strong disorder,\nthe gap does not close, and density of states profile continues to remain\npeaked in the gap, unlike in conventionally studied disordered systems. The\norigins of this behavior are traced to the nature of the quasiparticle\ndispersion. In our case, the quasiparticles are identified to be hybrid\nplasmons generated due to the hybridization of surface plasmon polaritons at a\nmetal-dielectric interface and cavity resonances at sub-wavelength apertures\nthereon. This situation is akin to the Kondo systems, where dispersive\nconduction electrons hybridise with a localized impurity state opening a\nhybridization gap.

When applied to state space models, it moves a\ncollection of parameters and latent states (which are called particles) through\na number of stages, with each stage having its own target distribution. The\nparticles are initially generated from a distribution that is easy to sample\nfrom, e.g. the prior; the target at the final stage is the posterior\ndistribution. Tempering is usually carried out either in batch mode, involving\nall the data at each stage, or sequentially with observations added at each\nstage, which is called data tempering. Our paper proposes efficient Markov\nmoves for generating the parameters and states for each stage of particle based\ndensity tempering. This allows the proposed SMC methods to increase (scale up)\nthe number of parameters and states that can be handled. Most of the current\nliterature uses a pseudo-marginal Markov move step with the states integrated\nout, and the parameters generated by a random walk proposal; although this\nstrategy is general, it is very inefficient when the states or parameters are\nhigh dimensional. We also build on the work of Dufays (2016) and make data\ntempering more robust to outliers and structural changes for models with\nintractable likelihoods by adding batch tempering at each stage.

We\nshow that for many of these pseudovarieties, the membership problem is actually\nin AC^0. To this end, we show that these pseudovarieties can be characterized\nby first-order sentences with multiplication as the only predicate.

In our proposed approach,a convolutional long-term\nencoder is used to encode the whole given motion sequence into a long-term\nhidden variable, which is used with a decoder to predict the remainder of the\nsequence. The decoder itself also has an encoder-decoder structure, in which\nthe short-term encoder encodes a shorter sequence to a short-term hidden\nvariable, and the spatial decoder maps the long and short-term hidden variable\nto motion predictions. By using such a model, we are able to capture both\ninvariant and dynamic information of human motion, which results in more\naccurate predictions.

Formally, we\nstart from the syntax of First Order Logic with equality and the semantics of\nQuantified Equilibrium Logic with evaluable functions (QELF). Then, we proceed\nto incorporate a new kind of logical term, intensional set (a construct\ncommonly used to denote the set of objects characterised by a given formula),\nand to extend QELF semantics for this new type of expression. In our extended\napproach, intensional sets can be arbitrarily used as predicate or function\narguments or even nested inside other intensional sets, just as regular\nfirst-order logical terms. As a result, aggregates can be naturally formed by\nthe application of some evaluable function (count, sum, maximum, etc) to a set\nof objects expressed as an intensional set. This approach has several\nadvantages. First, while other semantics for aggregates depend on some\nsyntactic transformation (either via a reduct or a formula translation), the\nQELF interpretation treats them as regular evaluable functions, providing a\ncompositional semantics and avoiding any kind of syntactic restriction. Second,\naggregates can be explicitly defined now within the logical language by the\nsimple addition of formulas that fix their meaning in terms of multiple\napplications of some (commutative and associative) binary operation. For\ninstance, we can use recursive rules to define sum in terms of integer\naddition. Last, but not least, we prove that the semantics we obtain for\naggregates coincides with the one defined by Gelfond and Zhang for the Alog\nlanguage, when we restrict to that syntactic fragment.

We also investigate our\nidealised model of the PD and show that the barycentre of the slit varies only\nslightly with time, meaning that the modal noise contribution is very low when\ncompared to conventional fibre systems.

The seismic response of steel storage tanks is quite different from\nbuilding structures not only due to hydrodynamic effects acting on the shell\nand bottom plate but also because of many sources of nonlinear behaviour\nmechanisms. For the earthquake-resistant design of tanks, it is important to\nuse a rational and reliable nonlinear dynamic analysis procedure, which is\ncapable of capturing the seismic behaviour of the tanks under artificial or\nreal earthquakes. The present paper deals with the nonlinear finite element\nmodelling of steel storage tanks subjected to seismic loadings. The interaction\neffects of fluid and structure are modelled using a surface-based\nacoustic-structural interaction in the ABAQUS software. The successive contact\nand separation between the bottom plate and its rigid foundation caused by\nsliding and uplift are taken into account by a contact modelling approach.\nReduced scales of both slender and broad cylindrical steel storage tanks from a\nshaking table campaign within the framework of the INDUSE-2-SAFETY project are\nselected for the study. The seismic responses of the tanks including the\nhydrodynamic pressure distribution acting on the shell plate, the elevation of\nthe liquid free surface, and the uplift response of the bottom plate when the\ntank is unanchored are presented and compared with the experimental results.\nThe responses obtained from the refined models are also compared with those\nobtained using a simplified approach, which is based on the lumped mass model\nof the liquid motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 08:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

However, the occurrence\nof an intrinsic antiferromagnetism above the Tc of (Li, Fe)OHFeSe\nsuperconductor is questioned. Here we report a systematic study on a series of\n(Li, Fe)OHFeSe single crystal samples with Tc up to ~41 K. We observe an\nevident drop in the static magnetization at Tafm ~125 K, in some of the SC (Tc\n< ~38 K, cell parameter c < ~9.27 {\\AA}) and non-SC samples. We verify that\nthis AFM signal is intrinsic to (Li, Fe)OHFeSe. Thus, our observations indicate\nmesoscopic-to-macroscopic coexistence of an AFM state with the normal (below\nTafm) or SC (below Tc) state in (Li, Fe)OHFeSe. We explain such coexistence by\nelectronic phase separation, similar to that in high-Tc cuprates and iron\narsenides. However, such an AFM signal can be absent in some other samples of\n(Li, Fe)OHFeSe, particularly it is never observed in the SC samples of Tc > ~38\nK, owing to a spatial scale of the phase separation too small for the\nmacroscopic magnetic probe. For this case, we propose a microscopic electronic\nphase separation. It is suggested that the microscopic static phase separation\nreaches vanishing point in high-Tc (Li, Fe)OHFeSe, by the occurrence of\ntwo-dimensional AFM spin fluctuations below nearly the same temperature as Tafm\nreported previously for a (Li, Fe)OHFeSe (Tc ~42 K) single crystal.

As one of its salient features, the wireless nodes involved in\nphysical-layer GSK generation extract randomness from a subset of their\nwireless channels, referred as the common source of randomness (CSR). Unlike\ntwo-user key generation, in GSK generation, some nodes must act as facilitators\nby broadcasting quantized versions of the linear combinations of the channel\nrealizations, so as to assist all the nodes to observe a CSR. However, we note\nthat broadcasting linear combination of channel realizations incurs non-zero\nleakage of the CSR to an eavesdropper, and moreover, quantizing the linear\ncombination also reduces the overall key-rate. Identifying these issues, we\npropose a practical GSK generation protocol, referred to as Algebraic\nSymmetrically Quantized GSK (A-SQGSK) protocol, in a network of three nodes,\nwherein due to quantization of symbols at the facilitator, the other two nodes\nalso quantize their channel realizations, and use them appropriately over\nalgebraic rings to generate the keys. First, we prove that the A-SQGSK protocol\nincurs zero leakage to an eavesdropper. Subsequently, on the CSR provided by\nthe A-SQGSK protocol, we propose a consensus algorithm among the three nodes,\ncalled the Entropy-Maximization Error-Minimization (EM-EM) algorithm, which\nmaximizes the entropy of the secret-key subject to an upper-bound on the\nmismatch-rate.

We refer to this approach as COBRAS-TS.\nAn extensive experimental evaluation supports the following claims: (1)\nCOBRAS-TS far outperforms the current state of the art in semi-supervised\nclustering for time series, and thus presents a new baseline for the field; (2)\nCOBRAS-TS can identify clusters with separated components; (3) COBRAS-TS can\nidentify clusters that are characterized by small local patterns; (4) a small\namount of semi-supervision can greatly improve clustering quality for time\nseries; (5) the choice of the clustering algorithm matters (contrary to earlier\nclaims in the literature).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 13:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

Aside from their fundamental significance,\nthey play an important role in practical applications, such as detection of\nquantum correlations and security requirements in quantum cryptography. In\ncontinuous variable systems, the spectra of the relevant observables form a\ncontinnuum and this necessitates the coarse graining of measurements. However,\nthese coarse-grained observables do not necessarily obey the same uncertainty\nrelations as the original ones, a fact that can lead to false results when\nconsidering applications. That is, one cannot naively replace the original\nobservables in the uncertainty relation for the coarse-grained observables and\nexpect consistent results. As such, a number of uncertainty relations that are\nspecifically designed for coarse-grained observables have been developed.

The modelling resulted in a\nstellar mass $M_{\\star} = 5.8^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$$\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, a central\nhydrogen mass fraction $X_c = 0.54^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$, and exponential convective\ncore overshooting parameter $f_{\\rm ov} = 0.004^{+0.014}_{-0.002}$. The low\nvalue for $f_{\\rm ov}$ is compatible with the suppression of near-core mixing\ndue to a magnetic field but the uncertainties are too large to pinpoint such\nsuppression as the sole physical interpretation. $[...]$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 13:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 15:12:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 12:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 11:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 08:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

In such situations, alternative multiple IS estimators involving\nsamples from multiple proposal distributions are preferred. Just like the naive\nIS, the success of these multiple IS estimators crucially depends on the choice\nof the proposal distributions. The selection of these proposal distributions is\nthe focus of this article. We propose three methods: (i) a geometric space\nfilling approach, (ii) a minimax variance approach, and (iii) a maximum entropy\napproach. The first two methods are applicable to any IS estimator, whereas the\nthird approach is described in the context of Doss's (2010) two-stage IS\nestimator. For the first method, we propose a suitable measure of 'closeness'\nbased on the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence, while the second and third\napproaches use estimates of asymptotic variances of Doss's (2010) IS estimator\nand Geyer's (1994) reverse logistic regression estimator, respectively. Thus,\nwhen samples from the proposal distributions are obtained by running Markov\nchains, we provide consistent spectral variance estimators for these asymptotic\nvariances.

For large or infinite state\nspaces, exact representations of the value function are usually not available,\nand it must be approximated by a function in some parametric family.\n  However, with \\emph{nonlinear} parametric approximations (such as neural\nnetworks), TD is not guaranteed to converge to a good approximation of the true\nvalue function within the family, and is known to diverge even in relatively\nsimple cases. TD lacks an interpretation as a stochastic gradient descent of an\nerror between the true and approximate value functions, which would provide\nsuch guarantees.\n  We prove that approximate TD is a gradient descent provided the current\npolicy is \\emph{reversible}. This holds even with nonlinear approximations.\n  A policy with transition probabilities $P(s,s')$ between states is reversible\nif there exists a function $\\mu$ over states such that\n$\\frac{P(s,s')}{P(s',s)}=\\frac{\\mu(s')}{\\mu(s)}$.

By using model of the database it means we use only the\nsummary or the very characteristic patterns of the database. Modeling is the\nPreserving Privacy Stage I, since by modeling the data is being symbolized. We\nimplement encryption on the database as preserving privacy Stage II.

Label learning is to let\nsemantic channels match Shannon's channels and label selection is to let\nShannon's channels match semantic channels. The Channel Matching (CM) algorithm\nis provided for multi-label classification. This algorithm adheres to maximum\nsemantic information criterion which is compatible with maximum likelihood\ncriterion and regularized least squares criterion. If samples are very large,\nwe can directly convert Shannon's channels into semantic channels by the third\nkind of Bayes' theorem; otherwise, we can train truth functions with parameters\nby sampling distributions. A label may be a Boolean function of some atomic\nlabels. For simplifying learning, we may only obtain the truth functions of\nsome atomic label. For a given label, instances are divided into three kinds\n(positive, negative, and unclear) instead of two kinds as in popular studies so\nthat the problem with binary relevance is avoided. For each instance, the\nclassifier selects a compound label with most semantic information or richest\nconnotation. As a predictive model, the semantic channel does not change with\nthe prior probability distribution (source) of instances. It still works when\nthe source is changed. The classifier changes with the source, and hence can\novercome class-imbalance problem.

The overarching objective of our HPCA 2014 paper is to reduce the\nsignificant negative performance impact of DRAM refresh with intelligent memory\ncontroller mechanisms.\n  To mitigate the negative performance impact of DRAM refresh, our HPCA 2014\npaper proposes two complementary mechanisms, DARP (Dynamic Access Refresh\nParallelization) and SARP (Subarray Access Refresh Parallelization). The goal\nis to address the drawbacks of state-of-the-art per-bank refresh mechanism by\nbuilding more efficient techniques to parallelize refreshes and accesses within\nDRAM. First, instead of issuing per-bank refreshes in a round-robin order, as\nit is done today, DARP issues per-bank refreshes to idle banks in an\nout-of-order manner. Furthermore, DARP proactively schedules refreshes during\nintervals when a batch of writes are draining to DRAM. Second, SARP exploits\nthe existence of mostly-independent subarrays within a bank. With minor\nmodifications to DRAM organization, it allows a bank to serve memory accesses\nto an idle subarray while another subarray is being refreshed. Our extensive\nevaluations on a wide variety of workloads and systems show that our mechanisms\nimprove system performance (and energy efficiency) compared to three\nstate-of-the-art refresh policies, and their performance bene ts increase as\nDRAM density increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 05:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

But all of\nexisting works focus on discrete time window super point cardinality estimation\nwhich has great latency and ignores many measuring periods. Sliding time window\nmeasures super point cardinality in a finer granularity than that of discrete\ntime window but also more complex. This paper firstly introduces an algorithm\nto estimate super point cardinality under sliding time window from distributed\nedge routers. This algorithm's ability of sliding super point cardinality\nestimating comes from a novel method proposed in this paper which can record\nthe time that a host appears. Based on this method, two sliding cardinality\nestimators, sliding rough estimator and sliding linear estimator, are devised\nfor super points detection and their cardinalities estimation separately. When\nusing these two estimators together, the algorithm consumes the smallest memory\nwith the highest accuracy. This sliding super point cardinality algorithm can\nbe deployed in distributed environment and acquire the global super points'\ncardinality by merging estimators of distributed nodes. Both of these\nestimators could process packets parallel which makes it becom possible to deal\nwith high speed network in real time by GPU.
