Noise pollution is one of the\ntopmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the U.S. with proven\neffects on health, education, the economy, and the environment. Yet, most\ncities lack the resources to continuously monitor noise and understand the\ncontribution of individual sources, the tools to analyze patterns of noise\npollution at city-scale, and the means to empower city agencies to take\neffective, data-driven action for noise mitigation. The SONYC project advances\nnovel technological and socio-technical solutions that help address these\nneeds.\n  SONYC includes a distributed network of both sensors and people for\nlarge-scale noise monitoring. The sensors use low-cost, low-power technology,\nand cutting-edge machine listening techniques, to produce calibrated acoustic\nmeasurements and recognize individual sound sources in real time. Citizen\nscience methods are used to help urban residents connect to city agencies and\neach other, understand their noise footprint, and facilitate reporting and\nself-regulation. Crucially, SONYC utilizes big data solutions to analyze,\nretrieve and visualize information from sensors and citizens, creating a\ncomprehensive acoustic model of the city that can be used to identify\nsignificant patterns of noise pollution. These data can be used to drive the\nstrategic application of noise code enforcement by city agencies to optimize\nthe reduction of noise pollution. The entire system, integrating cyber,\nphysical and social infrastructure, forms a closed loop of continuous sensing,\nanalysis and actuation on the environment.\n  SONYC provides a blueprint for the mitigation of noise pollution that can\npotentially be applied to other cities in the US and abroad.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 16:07:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 19:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

The reason for this is simple: it\nis prudent to seek to reduce sensor costs, since resources (e.g. hardware,\npersonnel and time) are finite. Consequently, rather than treating our plant as\nif it had infinite sensing resources, we seek to jointly maximise the utility\nof each perception. This reduces resource expenditure by explicitly minimising\nan observation-associated cost (e.g. battery use) while also facilitating the\npotential to yield better state estimates by virtue of being able to use more\nperceptions in noisy or unpredictable regions of state-space (e.g. a busy\ntraffic junction).

Programmers must try different combinations of a large set of\ntechniques to develop the best implementation for a specific algorithm and type\nof graph. Existing graph frameworks lack flexibility, supporting only a limited\nset of optimizations.\n  This paper introduces GraphIt, a new DSL for graph computations that\ngenerates fast implementations for algorithms with different performance\ncharacteristics running on graphs with different sizes and structures. GraphIt\nseparates what is computed (algorithm) from how it is computed (schedule).\nProgrammers specify the algorithm using an algorithm language, and performance\noptimizations are specified using a scheduling language. The algorithm language\nsimplifies expressing the algorithms. We formulate graph optimizations,\nincluding edge traversal direction, data layout, parallelization, cache, NUMA,\nand kernel fusion optimizations, as tradeoffs among locality, parallelism, and\nwork-efficiency.

The WR component in AB 6 was\npreviously found to be very luminous (logL=6.3[Lsun]) compared to its reported\norbital mass (8Msun), placing it significantly above the Eddington limit.\nThrough spectroscopy and orbital analysis of newly acquired optical data taken\nwith UVES, we aim to understand the peculiar results reported for this system\nand explore its evolutionary history.\n  Results: We find that AB 6 contains at least four stars. The 6.5d period WR\nbinary comprises the WR primary (WN3:h, star A) and a rather rapidly rotating\nearly O-type companion (O5.5 V, star B). Static N and He lines suggest the\npresence of an emission line star (O5.5 I(f), star C). Finally, narrow\nabsorption lines portraying a long-term radial velocity variation show the\nexistence of a fourth star (O7.5 V, star D). Star D appears to form a second\n140d period binary together with a fifth stellar member, which is a B-type\ndwarf or a black hole. It is not clear that these additional components are\nbound to the WR binary. The WR star is found to be less luminous than\npreviously thought (logL = 5.9[Lsun]) and, adopting 41Msun for star B, more\nmassive (18Msun). Correspondingly, the WR star does not exceed the Eddington\nlimit. We derive the initial masses of 60 and 40Msun for stars A and B and an\nage of 3.9 Myr for the system. The WR binary likely experienced nonconservative\nmass transfer in the past supported by the relatively rapid rotation of star B.\n  Conclusion: Our study shows that AB 6 is a multiple -- probably quintuple --\nsystem. This finding resolves the previously reported puzzle of the WR primary\nexceeding the Eddington limit and suggests that the WR star exchanged mass with\nits companion in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 18:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Recent studies suggest using SSDs as a\ncaching layer for HDD-based storage subsystems in virtualization platforms.\nSuch studies neglect to address the endurance and cost of SSDs, which can\nsignificantly affect the efficiency of I/O caching. Moreover, previous studies\nonly configure the cache size to provide the required performance level for\neach VM, while neglecting other important parameters such as cache write policy\nand request type, which can adversely affect both performance-per-cost and\nendurance.\n  In this paper, we present a new high-Endurance and Cost-efficient I/O Caching\n(ECI-Cache) scheme for virtualized platforms, which can significantly improve\nboth the performance-per-cost and endurance of storage subsystems as opposed to\npreviously proposed I/O caching schemes.

Via online characterization of workloads and using\nURD, ECI-Cache partitions the SSD cache across VMs and is able to dynamically\nadjust the cache size and write policy for each VM. To evaluate the proposed\nscheme, we have implemented ECI-Cache in an open source hypervisor, QEMU\n(version 2.8.0), on a server running the CentOS 7 operating system (kernel\nversion 3.10.0-327).

Such dependence on sensors and communication links\nexposes AVs to cyber-physical (CP) attacks by adversaries that seek to take\ncontrol of the AVs by manipulating their data. Thus, to ensure safe and optimal\nAV dynamics control, the data processing functions at AVs must be robust to\nsuch CP attacks. To this end, in this paper, the state estimation process for\nmonitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel\nadversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize\nthe robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and\nthe AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In\nthe formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor\nreadings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and\npotentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the\nroads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the\ndeviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions.\nSince the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the\ninfinite possibilities for data value manipulations, the outcome of the\nplayers' past interactions are fed to long-short term memory (LSTM) blocks.\nEach player's LSTM block learns the expected spacing deviation resulting from\nits own action and feeds it to its RL algorithm. Then, the the attacker's RL\nalgorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the\nAV's RL algorithm tries to find the optimal action that minimizes such\ndeviation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 19:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 16:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Second, to examine the data's support for\na covariate and to understand how adding that covariate moves variation in the\noutcome y out of the GP and error parts of the fit, we apply a linear-model\ndiagnostic, the added variable plot (AVP), both to the original observations\nand to projections of the data onto the spectral basis functions.

Deep\nlearning methods often parameterise a pose with a representation that separates\nrotation and translation. As commonly available frameworks do not provide means\nto calculate loss on a manifold, regression is usually performed using the\nL2-norm independently on the rotation's and the translation's\nparameterisations, which is a metric for linear spaces that does not take into\naccount the Lie group structure of SE(3).

In addition, it is well-known that due to\nnon-stationarity based covariate shifts, the input data distributions of\nEEG-based BCI systems change during inter- and intra-session transitions, which\nposes great difficulty for developments of online adaptive data-driven systems.\nEnsemble learning approaches have been used previously to tackle this\nchallenge. However, passive scheme based implementation leads to poor\nefficiency while increasing high computational cost. This paper presents a\nnovel integration of covariate shift estimation and unsupervised adaptive\nensemble learning (CSE-UAEL) to tackle non-stationarity in motor-imagery (MI)\nrelated EEG classification. The proposed method first employs an exponentially\nweighted moving average model to detect the covariate shifts in the common\nspatial pattern features extracted from MI related brain responses. Then, a\nclassifier ensemble was created and updated over time to account for changes in\nstreaming input data distribution wherein new classifiers are added to the\nensemble in accordance with estimated shifts. Furthermore, using two publicly\navailable BCI-related EEG datasets, the proposed method was extensively\ncompared with the state-of-the-art single-classifier based passive scheme,\nsingle-classifier based active scheme and ensemble based passive schemes. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed active scheme based ensemble\nlearning algorithm significantly enhances the BCI performance in MI\nclassifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 22:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

Thermal fluctuations affect\nthe buckling instability by two mechanisms. On the one hand, thermal\nfluctuations can renormalize the capsule's elastic properties and its pressure\nbecause of anharmonic couplings between normal displacement modes of different\nwavelengths. This effectively lowers its critical buckling pressure [Kosmrlj\nand Nelson, Phys. Rev. X 7, 011002 (2017)]. On the other hand, buckled shapes\nare energetically favorable already at pressures below the classical buckling\npressure. At these pressures, however, buckling requires to overcome an energy\nbarrier, which only vanishes at the critical buckling pressure. In the presence\nof thermal fluctuations the capsule can spontaneously overcome an energy\nbarrier of the order of the thermal energy by thermal activation already at\npressures below the critical buckling pressure. We revisit parameter\nrenormalization by thermal fluctuations and formulate a buckling criterion\nbased on scale-dependent renormalized parameters to obtain a\ntemperature-dependent critical buckling pressure. Then we quantify the\npressure-dependent energy barrier for buckling below the critical buckling\npressure using numerical energy minimization and analytical arguments. This\nallows us to obtain the temperature-dependent critical pressure for buckling by\nthermal activation over this energy barrier. Finally, we study the combined\neffect of parameter renormalization and thermal activation by using\nrenormalized parameters for the energy barrier in thermal activation to obtain\nour final result for the temperature-dependent critical pressure, which is\nsignificantly below the results if only parameter renormalization or only\nthermal activation is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 23:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Our solution achieves\nConcordant Correlation Coefficient (CCC) scores of 0.397 and 0.520 on arousal\nand valence respectively for the validation dataset, which outperforms the\nbaseline systems with the best CCC scores of 0.15 and 0.23 on arousal and\nvalence by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 00:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

The presence of fixed\nminimal adjustment costs produces adjustment stickiness so that agents must\nchoose a sequence of points at which time to perform their actions. This paper\nperforms an analysis of the effect of transaction costs on agent behaviour\nwithin a dynamic optimisation problem by way of introducing the theory of\nincentive design to optimal stochastic impulse control. The setup consists of\nan agent that maximises their utility by performing a sequence of purchases of\nsome consumable good over some time horizon whilst facing transaction costs and\na Principal that chooses the agent's transaction costs. This results in a\ndynamic Principal-Agent model in which the agent uses impulse controls to\nperform adjustments to their cash-flow process. We address the question of\nwhich fixed value of the transaction cost the Principal must choose to induce a\ndesired behaviour from the agent. We study the effect of changes to the\ntransaction cost and show that with an appropriate choice of transaction cost,\nthe agent's preferences can be sufficiently distorted so that the agent finds\nit optimal to maximise the Principal's objective even when the agent's\ncash-flow is unobserved by the Principal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 00:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 13:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

To better establish the early\nhistory of UCDs, we investigate the formation of UCD progenitor clusters from\nsuper giant molecular clouds (SGMCs), using hydrodynamical simulations. In this\nstudy we focus on SGMCs with masses $10^{7} - 10^{8} \\rm M_{\\odot}$ that can\nform massive star clusters that display physical properties similar to UCDs.

Recent simulations of spinning black holes and (indirect) theoretical\npredictions, suggest that a somewhat analogous effect may occur for purely\ngravitational phenomena. The magnitude and precise direction of this\n\"gravitational Magnus effect\" is still the subject of debate. Starting from the\nrigorous equations of motion for spinning bodies in General Relativity\n(Mathisson-Papapetrou equations), we show that indeed such an effect takes\nplace and is a fundamental part of the spin-curvature force. The effect arises\nwhenever there is a current of mass/energy, non-parallel to a body's spin. We\ncompute the effect explicitly for some astrophysical systems of interest: a\ngalactic dark matter halo, a black hole accretion disk, and the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime.

We also determine the phase boundary in the $V_1$-$V_2$ plane that\nseparates the semimetal from the quantum anomalous Hall state. Finally, we show\nthat the nematic semimetal, which was proposed for $|V_2| \\gg V_1$ at weak\ncoupling in a previous study, is absent, and the quantum anomalous Hall state\nis the only weak coupling instability of the spinless quadratic band touching\nsemimetal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 05:03:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 06:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

A single dedicated\nteam, typically practicing DevOps, is responsible for each microservice, i.e.,\nit \"owns\" the service. However, while systems relying on MSA have several\narchitectural advantages especially for cloud applications, their realization\nis characterized by an increased accidental complexity due to redundant\nhandcrafting of implementation, e.g., to make each service standalone runnable.\nA promising way to cope with such complexity is the usage of Model-driven\nDevelopment (MDD) whereby models are used as first-class entities in the\nsoftware development process.

Experimentally, this\nrepresents a significant measurement challenge, especially when full\nthree-dimensional data is needed to accurately characterise the turbulent\nfields. This paper presents a new approach to obtaining such data through\nwell-resolved, near-instantaneous volume-spanning measurements. This is\naccomplished by rapidly scanning the volume with a light sheet so that, at each\nscan location, planar two-dimensional measurements of three velocity components\nvia stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) and simultaneous density\ninformation via planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) can be made.\nUltimately, this rapid scanning technique permits the measurement of all three\ncomponents of velocity in a volume as well as simultaneously capturing the\nthree-dimensional density field. The scanning of the light sheet is\naccomplished by mounting the optics producing the light sheet on a linear\ntraverse that is capable of rapidly scanning the volume in a continuous manner.\nThe key and novel aspect enabling high scan rates is the addition of two\nmirrors on galvanometers to make small adjustments to the position of the light\nsheet and ensure a precise overlap between pairs of image frames. This new\ntechnique means the light sheet does not have to be excessively thick, the\nscanning speed too slow, or that inappropriately small interframe times have to\nbe used, while ensuring overlapping particle patterns between pairs of images\nthat are required by the PIV algorithm. The technique is illustrated with some\npreliminary results from the buoyancy-driven exchange flow through an inclined\nduct connecting two reservoirs containing different density fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 09:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

In this paper, we propose a general Partial\nHeterogeneous Context Label Embedding (PHCLE) framework to address these\nchallenges. Categorizing heterogeneous contexts into two groups, relational\ncontext and descriptive context, we design tailor-made matrix factorization\nformula to effectively exploit the label relatedness in each context. With a\nshared embedding principle across heterogeneous contexts, the label relatedness\nis selectively aligned in a shared space.

By taking the ratio of angular distributions for two\nprocesses, viz. breakup and elastic scattering, this new observable is nearly\nindependent of the reaction mechanism and hence much more sensitive to the\nprojectile structure than the cross sections for each single process. We study\nthe extension of the ratio method to proton-rich nuclei and also explore the\noptimum experimental conditions for measuring this new observable. We compare\naccurate dynamical calculations of reactions for proton-rich projectiles to the\nprediction of the ratio method. We use the dynamical eikonal approximation that\nprovides good results for this kind of reactions at intermediate energy. Our\ntests for 8B, an archteypical one-proton halo nucleus, on Pb, Ni, and C targets\nat 44 MeV/nucleon show that, the ratio works less well than for neutron halos\ndue to the non-negligible Coulomb interaction between the valence proton and\nthe target. Nevertheless, the ratio method still provides pertinent information\nabout nuclear structure on the proton-rich side of the valley of stability.\nInterestingly the method is not affected if energy ranges-or bins-are\nconsidered in the projectile continuum. This makes the ratio easier to measure\nexperimentally by increasing the breakup cross section. We also extend our\nanalysis to 17F, 25Al, and 27P, whose study is of interest to both nuclear\nastrophysics and nuclear structure. We show that, albeit less precise than for\none-neutron halo nuclei, nuclear-structure information can be inferred from the\nratio method applied to exotic proton-rich nuclei.

Our\ngoal is to minimize the end-to-end connection outage probability (COP) under\nthe constraint of a secrecy outage probability (SOP) threshold, by optimizing\nthe routing path and the transmit power of each hop jointly. We show that the\nglobally optimal solution could be obtained by a two-step procedure where the\noptimal transmit power has a closed-form and the optimal routing path can be\nfound by Dijkstra's algorithm. Then a friendly jammer with multiple antennas is\napplied to enhance the secrecy performance further, and the optimal transmit\npower of the jammer and each hop of the selected route is investigated. This\nproblem can be solved optimally via an iterative outer polyblock approximation\nwith one-dimension search algorithm.

Therefore, inferences of the intrinsic structure of \\sgra\\ at these\nwavelengths are sensitive to the assumed scattering model. In addition,\nextrapolations of the scattering model from long wavelengths, at which its\nparameters are usually estimated, to 1.3 mm, where the Event Horizon Telescope\n(EHT) seeks to image Sgr A* on Schwarzschild-radius scales, are also sensitive\nto the assumed scattering model. Past studies of Sgr A* have relied on simple\nGaussian models for the scattering kernel that effectively presume an inner\nscale of turbulence far greater than the diffractive scale; this assumption is\nlikely violated for Sgr A* at 1.3 mm. We develop a physically motivated model\nfor anisotropic scattering, using a simplified model for MHD turbulence with a\nfinite inner scale and a wandering transverse magnetic field direction.

If confirmed, one\nimplication is that the spin temperature of the 21 cm line is coupled to the\ngas temperature by z=20. The known mechanism for accomplishing this is the\nWouthuysen-Field effect, whereby Lyman-alpha photons scatter in the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) and impact the hyperfine level populations. This\nsuggests that early star formation had already produced a copious Lyman-alpha\nbackground by z=20, and strongly constrains models in which the linear matter\npower spectrum is suppressed on small-scales, since halo and star formation are\ndelayed in such scenarios. Here we consider the case that the dark matter\nconsists of ultra-light axions with macroscopic de Broglie wavelengths (fuzzy\ndark matter, FDM). We assume that star formation tracks halo formation and\nadopt two simple models from the current literature for the halo mass function\nin FDM.

However, opportunities to optimize such therapies are\nchallenged by the fact that the beneficial impact of focal stimulation on both\nneighboring and distant regions is not well understood. Here, we use network\ncontrol theory to build a model of brain network function that makes\npredictions about how stimulation spreads through the brain's white matter\nnetwork and influences large-scale dynamics. We test these predictions using\ncombined electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data\nwho volunteered to participate in an extensive stimulation regimen. We posit a\nspecific model-based manner in which white matter tracts constrain stimulation,\ndefining its capacity to drive the brain to new states, including states\nassociated with successful memory encoding. In a first validation of our model,\nwe find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more\naccurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical\nstimulation than the artificial patterns of null models. We then use a targeted\noptimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the\nbrain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger\nenergy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a\ntarget memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural\nproperties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on\nenergy requirements. Our work demonstrates that individual white matter\narchitecture plays a vital role in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical\nstimulation, more generally offering empirical support for the utility of\nnetwork control theoretic models of brain response to stimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 12:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

In the most common\napplications of the model, the pulse amplitudes are assumed exponentially\ndistributed, supported by conditional averaging of large-amplitude fluctuations\nin experimental measurement data. This basic assumption has two potential\nlimitations. First, statistical analysis of measurement data using conditional\naveraging only reveals the tail of the amplitude distribution to be\nexponentially distributed. Second, exponentially distributed amplitudes leads\nto a positive definite signal which cannot capture fluctuations in for example\nelectric potential and radial velocity. Assuming pulse amplitudes which are not\npositive definite often make finding a closed form for the probability density\nfunction difficult, even if the characteristic function remains relatively\nsimple. Thus estimating model parameters requires an approach based on the\ncharacteristic function, not the probability density function. In this\ncontribution, the effect of changing the amplitude distribution on the moments,\nprobability density function and characteristic function of the process is\ninvestigated and a parameter estimation method using the empirical distribution\nfunction is presented and tested on synthetically generated data.

Realistic motion sequences were generated using computer graphics\nsimulating self-motion in an underwater scene. Local retinal motion was\nestimated with a motion detector and encoded in four populations of\ndirectionally tuned retinal ganglion cells, represented as two signed input\nvariables. This activity was then used as input into one of two learning\nnetworks: a sparse coding network (competitive learning) and backpropagation\nnetwork (supervised learning). Both simulations develop specificities for optic\nflow which are comparable to those found in a neurophysiological study (Kubo et\nal. 2014), and relative frequencies of the various neuronal responses are best\nmodeled by the sparse coding approach. We conclude that the optic flow neurons\nin the zebrafish pretectum do reflect the optic flow statistics.

Stellar activity is currently challenging the detection of young\nplanets via the radial velocity (RV) technique. Aims. We attempt to\ndefinitively discriminate the nature of the RV variations for the young active\nK5 star BD+20 1790, for which visible (VIS) RV measurements show divergent\nresults on the existence of a substellar companion. Methods. We compare VIS\ndata with high precision RVs in the near infrared (NIR) range by using the\nGIANO - B and IGRINS spectrographs. In addition, we present for the first time\nsimultaneous VIS-NIR observations obtained with GIARPS (GIANO - B and HARPS -\nN) at Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). Orbital RVs are achromatic, so the RV\namplitude does not change at different wavelengths, while stellar activity\ninduces wavelength-dependent RV variations, which are significantly reduced in\nthe NIR range with respect to the VIS. Results. The NIR radial velocity\nmeasurements from GIANO - B and IGRINS show an average amplitude of about one\nquarter with respect to previously published VIS data, as expected when the RV\njitter is due to stellar activity. Coeval multi-band photometry surprisingly\nshows larger amplitudes in the NIR range, explainable with a mixture of cool\nand hot spots in the same active region. Conclusions. In this work, the claimed\nmassive planet around BD+20 1790 is ruled out by our data. We exploited the\ncrucial role of multi- wavelength spectroscopy when observing young active\nstars: thanks to facilities like GIARPS that provide simultaneous observations,\nthis method can reach its maximum potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 13:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

However, in real-world applications, labelled\ndata are only provided for some commonly used attributes (such as age, gender);\nwhereas, unlabelled data are available for other attributes (such as\nattraction, hairline). To address the above problem, we propose a novel deep\ntransfer neural network method based on multi-label learning for facial\nattribute classification, termed FMTNet, which consists of three sub-networks:\nthe Face detection Network (FNet), the Multi-label learning Network (MNet) and\nthe Transfer learning Network (TNet). Firstly, based on the Faster Region-based\nConvolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), FNet is fine-tuned for face\ndetection. Then, MNet is fine-tuned by FNet to predict multiple attributes with\nlabelled data, where an effective loss weight scheme is developed to explicitly\nexploit the correlation between facial attributes based on attribute grouping.\nFinally, based on MNet, TNet is trained by taking advantage of unsupervised\ndomain adaptation for unlabelled facial attribute classification. The three\nsub-networks are tightly coupled to perform effective facial attribute\nclassification. A distinguishing characteristic of the proposed FMTNet method\nis that the three sub-networks (FNet, MNet and TNet) are constructed in a\nsimilar network structure.

This problem is motivated from the Genome-wide association studies\n(GWAS) that have been widely used to identify risk variants underlying complex\nhuman traits/diseases. With a large number of completed GWAS, statistical\nmethods using summary statistics become more and more important because of\nrestricted accessibility to individual-level data sets. Theoretically\nguaranteed methods are highly demanding to advance the statistical inference\nwith a large amount of available marginal information. Here we propose an\n$\\ell_1$ penalized approach, REMI, to estimate high dimensional regression\ncoefficients with marginal information and external reference samples. We\nestablish an upper bound on the error of the REMI estimator, which has the same\norder as that of the minimax error bound of Lasso with complete\nindividual-level data. In particular, when marginal information is obtained\nfrom a large number of samples together with a small number of reference\nsamples, REMI yields good estimation and prediction results, and outperforms\nthe Lasso because the sample size of accessible individual-level data can be\nlimited. Through simulation studies and real data analysis of the NFBC1966 GWAS\ndata set, we demonstrate that REMI can be widely applicable.

These methods\nignore the inherent dependencies among these tasks (i.e., face detection,\nfacial landmark localization and FAC).

The motivating example is a group of animals\nthat disperse over patches of food of different abundances. In such scenarios,\nindividuals are biased towards selecting the higher quality patches, while, at\nthe same time, aiming to avoid costly collisions or overlaps. Our goal is to\ninvestigate the impact of collision costs on the parallel coverage of resources\nby the whole group. Consider M sites, where a site x has value f(x). We think\nof f(x) as the reward associated with site x, and assume that if a single\nindividual visits x exclusively, it receives this exact reward. Typically, we\nassume that if > 1 individuals visit x then each receives at most f(x). In\nparticular, when competition costs are high, each individual might receive an\namount strictly less than f(x), which could even be negative. Conversely,\nmodeling cooperation at a site, we also consider cases where each one gets more\nthan f(x). There are k identical players that compete over the rewards. They\nindependently act in parallel, in a one-shot scenario, each specifying a single\nsite to visit, without knowing which sites are explored by others. The group\nperformance is evaluated by the expected coverage, defined as the sum of f(x)\nover all sites that are explored by at least one player. Since we assume that\nplayers cannot coordinate before choosing their site we focus on symmetric\nstrategies. The main takeaway message of this paper is that the optimal\nsymmetric coverage is expected to emerge when collision costs are relatively\nhigh, so that the following \"Judgment of Solomon\" type of rule holds: If a\nsingle player explores a site x then it gains its full reward f(x), but if\nseveral players explore it, then neither one receives any reward. Under this\npolicy, it turns out that there exists a unique symmetric Nash Equilibrium\nstrategy, which is, in fact, evolutionary stable. Moreover, this strategy\nyields the best possible coverage among all symmetric strategies. Viewing the\ncoverage measure as the social welfare, this policy thus enjoys a (Symmetric)\nPrice of Anarchy of precisely 1, whereas, in fact, any other congestion policy\nhas a price strictly greater than 1. Our model falls within the scope of\nmechanism design, and more precisely in the area of incentivizing exploration.\nIt finds relevance in evolutionary ecology, and further connects to studies on\nBayesian parallel search algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 14:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

To prevent retrograde blood flow, the two intraluminal\nleaflets meet in the center of the vein and occlude the vessel. In\nfluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations of venous valves, the large\nstructural displacements may lead to mesh deteriorations and entanglements,\ncausing instabilities of the solver and, consequently, the numerical solution\nto diverge. In this paper, we propose an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)\nscheme for FSI simulations designed to solve these instabilities. A monolithic\nformulation for the FSI problem is considered and, due to the complexity of the\noperators, the exact Jacobian matrix is evaluated using automatic\ndifferentiation. The method relies on the introduction of a staggered in time\nvelocity %in the discretization scheme to improve stability, and on fictitious\nsprings to model the contact force of the valve leaflets. Since the large\nstructural displacements may compromise the quality of the fluid mesh as well,\na smoother fluid displacement, obtained with the introduction of a scaling\nfactor that measures the distance of a fluid element from the valve leaflet\ntip, guarantees that there are no mesh entanglements in the fluid domain. To\nfurther improve stability, a Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) method is\nemployed. The proposed ALE scheme is applied to a 2D model of a venous valve.\nThe presented simulations show that the proposed method deals well with the\nlarge structural displacements of the problem, allowing a reconstruction of the\nvalve behavior in both the opening and closing phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 14:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

For the\nsake of convenience, the three direction choices are respectively called\ndestination direction, following direction and detour direction in this paper.\nHere, it is found that the featured direction choices could be inspired by the\nshape characteristics of Voronoi diagram. To be specific, in the Voronoi cell\nof a pedestrian, the direction to a Voronoi node is regarded as a potential\n\"detour\" direction, and the direction perpendicular to a Voronoi link is\nregarded as a potential \"following\" direction. A pedestrian generally owns\nseveral alternative Voronoi nodes and Voronoi links in a Voronoi cell, and the\noptimal detour and following direction are determined by considering related\nfactors such as deviation. Plus the destination direction which is directly\npointing to the destination, the three basic direction choices are defined in a\nVoronoi cell. In order to evaluate the Voronoi diagram based basic directions,\nthe empirical trajectory data in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments\nare extracted. A time series method considering the step frequency is used to\nreduce the original trajectories' swaying phenomena which might disturb the\nrecognition of actual forward direction. The deviations between the empirical\nvelocity direction and the basic directions are investigated, and each velocity\ndirection is classified into a basic direction or regarded as an inexplicable\ndirection according to the deviations.

The current used a Fuse Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printer\nto print samples with known defects, in order to characterise the relative\neffects of different variables on the Lock-In phase data. Samples were printed\nusing ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and PLA (Polylactic Acid) for\ncomparisons, and variables such as print direction, cameras, heating power,\nLock-In frequency, as well as thickness, width and depth of defects were\nexplored.

Even cheap cameras like the Seek Thermal CompactXR\nwere proven capable of detecting the same defects as other cameras such as the\nFLIR SC7500. Heating power did not affect phase contrast, except for shallower\ndefects up to 1.0 mm deep, where higher power resulted in better contrast.

Magnetic\nreconnection is the rearrangement of magnetic field topology. The conventional\nSweet-Parker scheme and some of its extensions presume a non-turbulent medium\nand generally produce very slow reconnection or an unstable configuration.\nHowever, the assumption of laminar flow is unrealistic in astrophysics since,\neven in an initially quiet environment, magnetic reconnection by itself can\ndrive turbulence. The resulting turbulence has the potential to enhance the\nreconnection rate. This can lead to an unstable feedback loop as reconnection\ndrives turbulence and turbulence drives reconnection. Stochastic reconnection\nwas proposed, and subsequently tested by numerical simulations, for high\n$\\beta$ plasmas with a magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, $Pr_m\\sim 1$.\nThis model predicts reconnection speeds comparable to the large scale turbulent\neddy velocity. A recent study of stochastic reconnection for $Pr_m>1$ has shown\nthat the width of the outflow layer and the ejection velocity of matter from\nthe reconnection region seem to be unaffected by viscosity in typical\nastrophysical systems.

Using this method we are able to derive a new expression of\nthe expected running time of divisible load applications. This expression\nenables us to predict under which conditions a given run will yield acceptable\nperformance. For instance, we can easily calibrate the maximal number of\nprocessors one should use for a given work platform combination. We also\nconsider the impact of several algorithmic variants like simultaneous transfers\nof work or thresholds for avoiding useless transfers.

This\ntight-coupling between the software-provided resource specification and\nresource management in hardware leads to significant challenges in programming\nease, portability, and performance. Zorua is a new resource virtualization\nframework, that decouples the programmer-specified resource usage of a GPU\napplication from the actual allocation in the on-chip hardware resources.

Channels switch\nbetween an 'open' state with a well defined single amplitude of current and\n'closed' states with nearly zero current. The existing mean-field theory of ion\nchannels focuses almost solely on the open state. The physical modeling of the\ndynamical features of ion channels is still in its infancy, and does not\ndescribe the transitions between open and closed states, nor the distribution\nof the duration times of open states. One hypothesis is that gating corresponds\nto noise-induced fast transitions between multiple steady (equilibrium) states\nof the underlying system. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis.\nParticularly, our study focuses on the (high order) steric\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck-Cahn-Hilliard model since it has been successful in\npredicting permeability and selectivity of ionic channels in their open state,\nand since it gives rise to multiple steady states. We show that this system\ngives rise to a gating-like behavior, but that important features of this\nswitching behavior are different from the defining features of gating in\nbiological systems. Furthermore, we show that noise prohibits switching in the\nsystem of study. The above phenomena are expected to occur in other PNP-type\nmodels, strongly suggesting that one has to go beyond over-damped (gradient\nflow) Nernst-Planck type dynamics to explain the spontaneous gating of single\nchannels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2018 19:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}
