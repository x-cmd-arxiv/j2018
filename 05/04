For\nsubjective logic, a number of different fusion operators have been proposed,\neach matching a fusion scenario with different assumptions. However, not all of\nthese operators are associative, and therefore multi-source fusion is not\nwell-defined for these settings. In this paper, we address this challenge, and\ndefine multi-source fusion for weighted belief fusion (WBF) and consensus &\ncompromise fusion (CCF). For WBF, we show the definition to be equivalent to\nthe intuitive formulation under the bijective mapping between subjective logic\nand Dirichlet evidence PDFs. For CCF, since there is no independent\ngeneralization, we show that the resulting multi-source fusion produces valid\nopinions, and explain why our generalization is sound. For completeness, we\nalso provide corrections to previous results for averaging and cumulative\nbelief fusion (ABF and CBF), as well as belief constraint fusion (BCF), which\nis an extension of Dempster's rule. With our generalizations of fusion\noperators, fusing information from multiple sources is now well-defined for all\ndifferent fusion types defined in subjective logic. This enables wider\napplicability of subjective logic in applications where multiple actors\ninteract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 16:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

Our equations are expressed in terms of natality rates,\nmean productivity and mean consumption of the home-population and the immigrant\npopulation as well as policies of the Society to distribute resources among\nindividuals. We also study the impact of integration of one sub-population into\nthe other one, and in a third model, the additional influence of a continuous\nstream of new immigrants. Proofs of the results are based on classical limit\ntheorems, on Borel-Cantelli type arguments, on the Theorem of envelopment of\nBruss and Duerinckx (2015), on a maximum inequality of Bruss and Robertson\n(1991) and, in particular, on an extension of J.M.

Our result has several\nimplications in different contexts in which dynamics are adopted for\ncomputational and biological modeling purposes. In the context of Label\nPropagation Algorithms, a class of widely used heuristics for community\ndetection, it represents the first theoretical result on the behavior of a\ndistributed label propagation algorithm with quasi-linear message complexity.\nIn the context of evolutionary biology, dynamics such as the Moran process have\nbeen used to model the spread of mutations in genetic populations [Lieberman,\nHauert, and Nowak 2005]; our result shows that, when the probability of\nadoption of a given mutation by a node of the evolutionary graph depends\nsuper-linearly on the frequency of the mutation in the neighborhood of the node\nand the underlying evolutionary graph exhibits a community structure, there is\na non-negligible probability for species differentiation to occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 16:21:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 12:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

We aim to resolve, spatially and spectrally, the continuum and\nhydrogen emission lines in the 2.12-2.47 micron region, to shed light on the\nimmediate circumstellar environment of the star. VLTI/AMBER K-band observations\nprovide spectra, visibilities, differential phases, and closure phases along\nthree long baselines for the continuum, and HI emission in Br$\\gamma$ and five\nhigh-n Pfund lines.

Here,\nwe consider theoretically and numerically a single droplet sitting on an\n(insulated) conductor, i.e., within a capacitor. The droplet consists of a pure\nphase without solutes, while the surrounding fluid contains a symmetric\nmonovalent electrolyte, and the interface between them is impermeable. Using\nnonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann theory, we present a theoretical prediction of the\ndependency of the apparent contact angle on the applied electric potential. We\nthen present well-resolved dynamic simulations of electrowetting using a\nphase-field model, where the entire two-phase electrokinetic problem, including\nthe electric double layers (EDLs), is resolved. The simulations show that,\nwhile the contact angle on scales smaller than the EDL is unaffected by the\napplication of an electric field, an apparent contact angle forms on scales\nbeyond the EDL. This contact angle relaxes in time towards a saturated apparent\ncontact angle. The dependency of the contact angle upon applied electric\npotential is in good compliance with the theoretical prediction. The only\nphenomenological parameter in the prediction is shown to only depend on the\npermeability ratio between the two phases. Based on the resulting unified\ndescription, we obtain an effective expression of the contact angle which can\nbe used in more macroscopic numerical simulations, i.e. where the\nelectrokinetic problem is not fully resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 17:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

An important step in the\nuncertainty analysis is the sensitivity analysis of various uncertain input\nparameters. The common approach for computing the sensitivities, e.g.\nvariance-based and regression-based methods, requires solving the governing\nequation multiple times, which is expensive in terms of computational cost. An\nalternative approach to compute the sensitivities is the adjoint method. The\ncost of solving an adjoint equation is comparable to the cost of solving the\ngoverning equation. Once the adjoint solution is available, the sensitivities\nto any number of parameters can be obtained with little cost. However,\nsuccessful application of adjoint sensitivity analysis to two-phase flow\nsimulations is rare. In this work, an adjoint sensitivity analysis framework is\ndeveloped based on the discrete adjoint method and a new implicit forward\nsolver. The framework is tested with the faucet flow problem and the BFBT\nbenchmark. Adjoint sensitivities are shown to match analytical sensitivities\nvery well in the faucet flow problem.

We first describe\nthe ergodic region using a GOE random matrix and perform an exact\ndiagonalization study of small systems. The results are in excellent agreement\nwith a refined theory of the thermalization avalanche that includes transient\nfinite-size effects, lending strong support to the avalanche scenario. We then\nexplore the limit of large system sizes by modeling the ergodic region via a\nHubbard model with all-to-all random hopping: the combined system, consisting\nof the bubble and the insulator, can be reduced to an effective Anderson\nimpurity problem. We find that the spectral function of a local operator in the\nergodic region changes dramatically when coupling to a large number of\nlocalized fermionic states---this occurs even when the localized sites are\nweakly coupled to the bubble. In principle, for a given size of the ergodic\nregion, this may arrest the avalanche.

The magnitude of this feature is\npredicted to be independent of age at fixed chemical composition. For this\nreason, its difference in magnitude with respect to the MS turn-off (MS-TO)\npoint has been suggested as a possible diagnostic to estimate absolute globular\ncluster (GC) ages. We first demonstrate that the operational definition of the\nMS-knee currently adopted in the literature refers to the inflection point of\nthe MS (that we here more appropriately named MS-saddle), a feature that is\nwell distinct from the knee and that cannot be used as its proxy. The MS-knee\nis only visible in near-infrared CMDs, while the MS-saddle can be also detected\nin optical-NIR CMDs. By using different sets of isochrones we then demonstrate\nthat the absolute magni- tude of the MS-knee varies by a few tenths of a dex\nfrom one model to another, thus showing that at the moment stellar models may\nnot capture the full systematic error in the method. We also demonstrate that\nwhile the absolute magnitude of the MS-saddle is almost coincident in different\nmodels, it has a systematic dependence on the adopted color combinations which\nis not predicted by stellar models. Hence, it cannot be used as a reliable\nreference for absolute age determination. Moreover, when statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties are properly taken into ac- count, the difference in\nmagnitude between the MS-TO and the MS-saddle does not provide absolute ages\nwith better accuracy than other methods like the MS-fitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 18:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Folded Reed-Solomon codes were the first\nexplicit constructions of codes known to achieve list-decoding capacity;\nmultivariate multiplicity codes were the first constructions of high-rate\nlocally correctable codes; and univariate multiplicity codes are also known to\nachieve list-decoding capacity.\n  However, previous analyses of the error-correction properties of these codes\ndid not yield optimal results. In particular, in the list-decoding setting, the\nguarantees on the list-sizes were polynomial in the block length, rather than\nconstant; and for multivariate multiplicity codes, local list-decoding\nalgorithms could not go beyond the Johnson bound.\n  In this paper, we show that Folded Reed-Solomon codes and multiplicity codes\nare in fact better than previously known in the context of list-decoding and\nlocal list-decoding. More precisely, we first show that Folded RS codes achieve\nlist-decoding capacity with constant list sizes, independent of the block\nlength; and that high-rate univariate multiplicity codes can also be\nlist-recovered with constant list sizes. Using our result on univariate\nmultiplicity codes, we show that multivariate multiplicity codes are high-rate,\nlocally list-recoverable codes.

Detection of these biomarkers is challenging since due to the\ndiffusion and degradation, the biomarkers are only detectable in the vicinity\nof the target. In addition, the exact location of the target within the tissue\nis not known.

In relation to the face recognition problem, we\nformulated an example of such a usecase, the `backyard dog' problem. The\n`backyard dog', implemented by a lean network, should correctly identify\nmembers from a limited group of individuals, a `family', and should distinguish\nbetween them. At the same time, the network must produce an alarm to an image\nof an individual who is not in a member of the family. To produce such a\nnetwork, we propose a shallowing algorithm. The algorithm takes an existing\ndeep learning model on its input and outputs a shallowed version of it. The\nalgorithm is non-iterative and is based on the Advanced Supervised Principal\nComponent Analysis. Performance of the algorithm is assessed in exhaustive\nnumerical experiments. In the above usecase, the `backyard dog' problem, the\nmethod is capable of drastically reducing the depth of deep learning neural\nnetworks, albeit at the cost of mild performance deterioration.\n  We developed a simple non-iterative method for shallowing down pre-trained\ndeep networks.

The study\nfocuses on the effects of three parameters: Ohnesorge number, the ratio of the\nviscous forces to inertial and surface tension forces, the liquid filament\naspect ratio, and where there is a substrate, a measure of the fluid slip on\nthe substrate, i.e. slip length. Through these parameters, it is determined\nwhether a liquid filament breaks up during the evolution toward its final\nequilibrium state. Three scenarios are identified: a collapse into a single\ndroplet, the breakup into one or multiple droplets, and recoalescence into a\nsingle droplet after the breakup (or even possibly another breakup after\nrecoalescence). The results are compared with the ones available in the\nliterature for free-standing liquid filaments. The findings show that the\npresence of the substrate promotes breakup of the filament. The effect of the\ndegree of slip on the breakup is also discussed. The parameter domain regions\nare comprehensively explored when including the slip effects. An experimental\ncase is also carried out to illustrate the collapse and breakup of a\nfinite-size silicon oil filament supported on a substrate, showcasing a\ncritical length of the breakup in a physical configuration.

This critical value separates a phase where the amount of vaccines\nis sufficient, from a phase where the disease is strong enough to exhaust all\nthe vaccination units.

We show that it is often possible to\naccurately estimate this \"learnability\" even when given an amount of data that\nis too small to reliably learn any accurate model. Our first result applies to\nthe setting where the data is drawn from a $d$-dimensional distribution with\nisotropic covariance (or known covariance), and the label of each datapoint is\nan arbitrary noisy function of the datapoint. In this setting, we show that\nwith $O(\\sqrt{d})$ samples, one can accurately estimate the fraction of the\nvariance of the label that can be explained via the best linear function of the\ndata. In contrast to this sublinear sample size, finding an approximation of\nthe best-fit linear function requires on the order of $d$ samples. Our\nsublinear sample results and approach also extend to the non-isotropic setting,\nwhere the data distribution has an (unknown) arbitrary covariance matrix: we\nshow that, if the label $y$ of point $x$ is a linear function with independent\nnoise, $y = \\langle x , \\beta \\rangle + noise$ with $\\|\\beta \\|$ bounded, the\nvariance of the noise can be estimated to error $\\epsilon$ with\n$O(d^{1-1/\\log{1/\\epsilon}})$ if the covariance matrix has bounded condition\nnumber, or $O(d^{1-\\sqrt{\\epsilon}})$ if there are no bounds on the condition\nnumber.

Using Shannon's\ncommunications theory, we posit that information in the brain is represented in\ndiscrete form. We address this hypothesis using 2 approaches. First, we\nidentify the fundamental communication requirements of the brain. Second, we\nestimate the symbol error probability and channel capacity for a continuous\ninformation representation. Our work concludes that information cannot be\ncommunicated and represented reliably in the brain using a continuous\nrepresentation - it has to be in a discrete form.

With the two dose\nvalues, the expected and the measured total dose, the radiation shielding and\nthe activity of the Sun are estimated. To judge the risk or safety margin the\nradiation effects on humans are opposed. The radiation from the Sun has to be\nset to zero in the computer model to achieve the published radiation dose value\nof the Apollo 11 flight. Galactic and cosmic particles have not been modelled\neither. The Apollo 11 astronauts must have been lucky that during their flight\nthe Sun was totally quiet in the solar maximum year 1969 - and also their\ncolleagues of the subsequent Apollo flights, i.e. until 1972, where the\npublished dose values still require a quiet Sun. The here built mathematical\nmodel allows assessing the total dose of a journey to Mars by only changing the\nflight duration.

This\nenergy range represents the low-energy limit of the string models (degree of\nfreedom: quark and gluon) or the high-energy limit of the so-called spallation\nmodels (degree of freedom: hadrons). A well known spallation model is INCL, the\nLi\\`ege intranuclear cascade model (combined with a de-excitation model to\ncomplete the reaction). INCL, known to give good results up to 2-3 GeV, was\nrecently upgraded by the implementation of multiple pion emission to extend the\nenergy range of applicability up to roughly 15 GeV. The next step, to account\nalso for strange particle production, both for refining the high energy domain\nand making it usable when strangeness appears, requires the following main\ningredients: i) the relevant elementary cross sections (production, scattering,\nand absorption) and ii) the characteristics of the associated final states.\nSome of those ingredients are already known and, sometimes, are already used in\nmodels of the same type (e.g., Bertini, GiBUU), but this paper aims at\nreviewing the situation by compiling, updating, and comparing the necessary\nelementary information which are independent of the model used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 08:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

One way out\nof this conundrum restricts communication to proceed by round. A great variety\nof message-passing models can then be captured in the Heard-Of model, through\npredicates on the messages sent in a round and received during or before this\nround. Then, the issue is to find the most accurate Heard-Of predicate to\ncapture a given model. This is straightforward in synchronous models, because\nwaiting for the upper bound on communication delay ensures that all available\nmessages are received, while not waiting forever. On the other hand, asynchrony\nallows unbounded message delays. Is there nonetheless a meaningful\ncharacterization of asynchronous models by a Heard-Of predicate?\n  We formalize this characterization by introducing Delivered collections: the\ncollections of all messages delivered at each round, whether late or not.\nPredicates on Delivered collections capture message-passing models. The\nquestion is to determine which Heard-Of predicates can be generated by a given\nDelivered predicate. We answer this by formalizing strategies for when to\nchange round. Thanks to a partial order on these strategies, we also find the\n\"best\" strategy for multiple models, where \"best\" intuitively means it waits\nfor as many messages as possible while not waiting forever. Finally, a strategy\nfor changing round that never blocks a process forever implements a Heard-Of\npredicate. This allows us to translate the order on strategies into an order on\nHeard-Of predicates. The characterizing predicate for a model is then the\ngreatest element for that order, if it exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 08:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 15:48:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 15:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

Such non-stationary models arise\nnaturally in contexts in which time-of-day effects or seasonality effects need\nto be incorporated. Our approximations are valid asymptotically in regimes in\nwhich the transition probabilities change slowly over time. Specifically, we\ndevelop approximations for the expected infinite horizon discounted reward, the\nexpected reward to the hitting time of a set, the expected reward associated\nwith the state occupied by the chain at time $n$, and the expected cumulative\nreward over an interval $[0,n]$. In each case, the approximation involves a\nlinear system of equations identical in form to that which one would need to\nsolve to compute the corresponding quantity for a Markov model having\nstationary transition probabilities. In that sense, the theory provides an\napproximation no harder to compute than in the traditional stationary context.\nWhile most of the theory is developed for finite state Markov chains, we also\nprovide generalizations to continuous state Markov chains, and finite state\nMarkov jump processes in continuous time. In the latter context, one of our\napproximations coincides with the uniform acceleration asymptotic due to Massey\nand Whitt (1998).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 08:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-07"}

Possible underlying processes\nresponsible for the instant rise in temperature during condensation are\ndiscussed.

In the last 10-15 years,\nseveral papers have dealt with weakly admissible external fields, in the sense\nthat $Q$ satisfies a weaker condition at infinity, namely, $$\\exists\nM\\in(-\\infty,\\infty],\\quad\\liminf_{|x| \\rightarrow \\infty}(Q(x) - \\log |x|) =\nM.$$ Under this last assumption, there still exists a unique equilibrium\nmeasure in the external field $Q$, but the support need not be a compact subset\nof $\\Sigma$ anymore. In most examples considered in the literature the support\nis indeed unbounded. Our main goal in this paper is to illustrate this topic by\nmeans of a simple class of external fields on the real axis created by a pair\nof attractive and repellent charges in the complex plane, and to study the\ndynamics of the associated equilibrium measures as the strength of the charges\nevolves. As one of our findings, we exhibit configurations where the support of\nthe equilibrium measure in a weakly admissible external field is a compact\nsubset of the real axis. To achieve our goal, we extend some results from\npotential theory, known for admissible external fields, to the weakly\nadmissible case. These new results may be of independent interest. Finally, the\nso--called signed equilibrium measure is an important tool in our analysis. Its\nrelationship with the (positive) equilibrium measure is also explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 09:28:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 16:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

It is because of their\nmagnetic fields that these otherwise small ed inert, cooling dead stars emit\nradio pulses and shine in various part of the electromagnetic spectrum. But the\npresence of a strong magnetic field has more subtle and sometimes dramatic\nconsequences: In the last decades of observations indeed, evidence mounted that\nit is likely the magnetic field that makes of an isolated neutron star what it\nis among the different observational manifestations in which they come. The\ncontribution of the magnetic field to the energy budget of the neutron star can\nbe comparable or even exceed the available kinetic energy. The most magnetised\nneutron stars in particular, the magnetars, exhibit an amazing assortment of\nexplosive events, underlining the importance of their magnetic field in their\nlives. In this chapter we review the recent observational and theoretical\nachievements, which not only confirmed the importance of the magnetic field in\nthe evolution of neutron stars, but also provide a promising unification scheme\nfor the different observational manifestations in which they appear. We focus\non the role of their magnetic field as an energy source behind their persistent\nemission, but also its critical role in explosive events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 09:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

We generate\nseveral optimised designs, ranked in terms of their predicted load power\noutput. The three best designs are subsequently constructed and subjected to\ncontrolled practical evaluation while attached to the leg of a human subject.\nThe results show that the ranking of the measured output power corresponds to\nthe ranking predicted by the optimisation, and that the numerical model\ncorrectly Predicts the relative differences in generated power for complex\nmotion.

The amount of internal energy imparted\nto the ions prior to the ion mobility cell is a source of experimental\nvariation. Here we investigated the effects of virtually all tuning parameters\nof the Agilent 6560 IM-Q-TOF on the arrival time distributions of Ubiquitin7+,\nand found conditions in which the native state prevails. We will discuss the\neffects of solvent evaporation conditions in the source, in the entire pre-IM\nDC voltage gradient, and with the funnel RF amplitudes, and will also report on\nubiquitin7+ conformations in different solvents, including native supercharging\nconditions. Collision-induced unfolding (CIU) can be conveniently provoked in\ntwo distinct regions: behind the source capillary (by changing the fragmentor\nvoltage) and in the trapping funnel (by changing the trap entrance grid delta\nvoltage). The softness of the instrumental conditions were then optimized with\nthe benchmark DNA G-quadruplex [(dG4T4G4)2.(NH4+)3-8H]5-, for which ion\nactivation results in ammonia loss. To reduce the ion internal energy and\nobtain the intact 3-NH4+ complex, we reduced the post-IM voltage gradient, but\nthis resulted in a lower IM resolving power due to increased diffusion behind\nthe drift tube. The article thus describes the various trade-offs between ion\nactivation, ion transmission, and ion mobility performance for native MS of\nvery fragile structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 12:15:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 14:05:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 13:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

The transport of heat\ncan be particularly revealing because, in principle, all types of excitations\nin a solid may contribute. Heat transport is well understood for phonons and\nelectrons, but relatively little is known about heat transported by magnetic\nexcitations. However, during the last about two decades, the magnetic heat\ntransport attracted increasing attention after the discovery of large and\nunusual signatures of it in low-dimensional quantum magnetic cuprate materials.\nToday it constitutes an important probe to otherwise often elusive, topological\nquasiparticles in a broader class of quantum magnets.

Our approach differs from recent fair ranking approaches in two\nimportant ways. First, existing works measure unfairness at the level of\nsubject groups while our measures capture unfairness at the level of individual\nsubjects, and as such subsume group unfairness.

The latter is usually assumed to be deleterious for the\nfeasibility of specific control tasks, since it can be responsible for\nuncontrolled time-dependent changes of the system. However, if the effects of\nthe random interaction with a noisy environment are properly modeled by the\nintroduction of a given stochasticity within the dynamics of the system, then\neven noise contributions might be seen as control knobs. As a matter of fact,\neven a partial knowledge of the environment can allow to set the system in a\ndynamical condition in which the response is optimized by the presence of noise\nsources. In particular, we have investigated what kind of measurement devices\ncan work better in noisy dynamical regimes and studied how to maximize the\nresultant information via the adoption of estimation algorithms.

Finally, the energy cost in maintaining the system in the\nnon-equilibrium regime due to the presence of the environment is evaluated by\nreconstructing the corresponding thermodynamics entropy production.

We use\nnonlinear dynamical systems to model the physical environment (plants). The\ngoal is to synthesize controllers for these plants while guaranteeing formal\ncorrectness w.r.t. given specifications. We consider different fundamental\nspecifications including stability, safety, and reach-while-stay. Stability\nspecification states that the execution traces of the system remain close to an\nequilibrium state and approach it asymptotically. Safety specification requires\nthe execution traces to stay in a safe region. Finally, for reach-while-stay\nspecification, safety is needed until a target set is reached.\n  The design task consists of two phases. In the first phase, the control\ndesign problem is reduced to the question of finding a control certificate.\nMore precisely, the goal of the first phase is to define a class of control\ncertificates with a specific structure. This definition should guarantee the\nfollowing: \"Having a control certificate, one can systematically design a\ncontroller and prove its correctness at the same time.\" The goal in the second\nphase is to find such a control certificate. We define a potential control\ncertificate space (hypothesis space) using parameterized functions. Next, we\nprovide an inductive search framework to find proper parameters, which yield a\ncontrol certificate.\n  Finally, we evaluate our framework. We show that discovering control\ncertificates is practically feasible and demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nautomatically designed controllers through simulations and real physical\nsystems experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 15:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-07"}

The considered positioning approach exploits\nmeasurement of Time-Of-Arrival (TOA) and Angle-Of-Departure (AOD), which are\nestimated from beamformed NR synchronization signals. Based on the given\nmeasurements and the assumed train movement model, the train position is\ntracked by using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is able to handle the\nnon-linear relationship between the TOA and AOD measurements, and the estimated\ntrain position parameters.

Despite their good performance in downstream processes (e.g., node\nclassification, link prediction), there is still room for improvement in\ndifferent aspects, like efficacy, visualization, and interpretability. In this\npaper, we propose, t-PINE, a method that addresses these limitations. Contrary\nto baseline methods, which generally learn explicit graph representations by\nsolely using an adjacency matrix, t-PINE avails a multi-view information graph,\nthe adjacency matrix represents the first view, and a nearest neighbor\nadjacency, computed over the node features, is the second view, in order to\nlearn explicit and implicit node representations, using the Canonical Polyadic\n(a.k.a.

We argue that the implicit and the explicit mapping\nfrom a higher-dimensional to a lower-dimensional vector space is the key to\nlearn more useful, highly predictable, and gracefully interpretable\nrepresentations. Having good interpretable representations provides a good\nguidance to understand how each view contributes to the representation learning\nprocess. In addition, it helps us to exclude unrelated dimensions.

We present by generators and\nequations the PROP IH of string diagrams whose free model is SVk. IH stands for\ninteracting Hopf algebras: its equations arise by distributive laws between\nHopf algebras, which we obtain using Lack's technique for composing PROPs. The\nsignificance of the result is two-fold. First, it offers a canonical\ndiagrammatic syntax for linear algebra: linear maps, kernels, subspaces, etc...\nare all faithfully represented in the graphical language. Second, the equations\nof IH describe familiar algebraic structures - Hopf algebras and Frobenius\nalgebras - which are at the heart of graphical formalisms as seemingly diverse\nas quantum circuits, signal flow graphs, simple electrical circuits and Petri\nnets. Our characterisation enlightens the provenance of these axioms and\nreveals their linear algebraic nature. Our second main contribution is an\napplication of IH to the semantics of signal processing circuits. We develop a\nformal theory of signal flow graphs, featuring a diagrammatic circuit syntax, a\nstructural operational semantics and a denotational semantics. We prove\ncompleteness of the equations of IH for denotational equivalence. Also, we\nstudy full abstraction: it turns out that the purely operational picture is too\nconcrete - two denotationally equal graphs may exhibit different operational\nbehaviour. We classify the ways in which this can occur and show that any graph\ncan be realised - rewritten, using the equations of IH, into an executable form\nwhere the operational behaviour and the denotation coincide.

The cost\nper capacity of SSDs, however, prevents them from entirely replacing HDDs in\nsuch systems. One approach to effectively take advantage of SSDs is to use them\nas a caching layer to store performance critical data blocks to reduce the\nnumber of accesses to disk subsystem. Due to characteristics of Flash-based\nSSDs such as limited write endurance and long latency on write operations,\nemploying caching algorithms at the Operating System (OS) level necessitates to\ntake such characteristics into consideration. Previous caching techniques are\noptimized towards only one type of application, which affects both generality\nand applicability. In addition, they are not adaptive when the workload pattern\nchanges over time. This paper presents an efficient Reconfigurable Cache\nArchitecture (ReCA) for storage systems using a comprehensive workload\ncharacterization to find an optimal cache configuration for I/O intensive\napplications. For this purpose, we first investigate various types of I/O\nworkloads and classify them into five major classes. Based on this\ncharacterization, an optimal cache configuration is presented for each class of\nworkloads. Then, using the main features of each class, we continuously monitor\nthe characteristics of an application during system runtime and the cache\norganization is reconfigured if the application changes from one class to\nanother class of workloads. The cache reconfiguration is done online and\nworkload classes can be extended to emerging I/O workloads in order to maintain\nits efficiency with the characteristics of I/O requests. Experimental results\nobtained by implementing ReCA in a server running Linux show that the proposed\narchitecture improves performance and lifetime up to 24\\% and 33\\%,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2018 19:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

The Loki many-core processor architecture is\nvery promising for achieving specialised hardware performance and efficiency\nwhile being a general purpose solution. Loki combines many simple cores with\nincreased control for the programmer. This freedom can be exploited to produce\nmuch more efficient code than in conventional multiprocessors but it also\ncreates a very big design space for possible optimisations. In this project, I\nexplore possible optimisations for a CNN application, their portability on\ndifferent Loki-specific configurations, convolution parameters and inputs.\nFinally, I investigate the potential for adaptive algorithms for further\nperformance increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 11:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}
