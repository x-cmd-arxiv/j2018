Inappropriate analysis methods may result in\nmisleading conclusions about a therapy's safety and consequently its\nbenefit-risk ratio. The statistical analysis of AEs is complicated by the fact\nthat the follow-up times can vary between the patients included in a clinical\ntrial. This paper takes as its focus the analysis of AE data in the presence of\nvarying follow-up times within the benefit assessment of therapeutic\ninterventions. Instead of approaching this issue directly and solely from an\nanalysis point of view, we first discuss what should be estimated in the\ncontext of safety data, leading to the concept of estimands. Although the\ncurrent discussion on estimands is mainly related to efficacy evaluation, the\nconcept is applicable to safety endpoints as well. Within the framework of\nestimands, we present statistical methods for analysing AEs with the focus\nbeing on the time to the occurrence of the first AE of a specific type. We give\nrecommendations which estimators should be used for the estimands described.\nFurthermore, we state practical implications of the analysis of AEs in clinical\ntrials and give an overview of examples across different indications. We also\nprovide a review of current practices of health technology assessment (HTA)\nagencies with respect to the evaluation of safety data. Finally, we describe\nproblems with meta-analyses of AE data and sketch possible solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 16:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 08:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

The energetically most stable polaron site is the subsurface Ti\natom below the undercoordinated surface Ti atom, owing to a small energy cost\nto distort the lattice and a suitable electrostatic potential. Polaron-polaron\nrepulsion and polaron-vacancy attraction determine the spatial distribution of\npolarons as well as the energy of the polaronic in-gap state. In the range of\nexperimentally reachable oxygen vacancy concentrations the calculated data are\nin excellent agreement with observations, thus validating the overall\ninterpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 16:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

One complication, however, is that it is\noften difficult to anticipate the effects of algorithmic policies prior to\ndeployment, making the decision to adopt them risky. In particular, one\ngenerally cannot use historical data to directly observe what would have\nhappened had the actions recommended by the algorithm been taken. One standard\nstrategy is to model potential outcomes for alternative decisions assuming that\nthere are no unmeasured confounders (i.e., to assume ignorability). But if this\nignorability assumption is violated, the predicted and actual effects of an\nalgorithmic policy can diverge sharply. In this paper we present a flexible,\nBayesian approach to gauge the sensitivity of predicted policy outcomes to\nunmeasured confounders. We show that this policy evaluation problem is a\ngeneralization of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in observational\nstudies, and so our methods can immediately be applied to that setting.\nFinally, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that under certain\nconditions it is possible to construct near-optimal algorithmic policies even\nwhen ignorability is violated. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on a\nlarge dataset of judicial actions, in which one must decide whether defendants\nawaiting trial should be required to pay bail or can be released without\npayment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 17:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-07"}

The induced stellar\nmultipoles are an added source of gravitational radiation and modify the\norbital dynamics, producing a slight acceleration of the coalescence which\nmanifests as a phase shift in the waveform relative to point-particles. The\ndominant piece of this tidal phase comes from the mass quadrupoles, which\ncontribute at fifth post-Newtonian order (5PN). Current quadrupoles and mass\noctupoles contribute at higher orders. For spinning neutron stars, additional\nmultipole moments are induced by nonlinear couplings between spin and tides. We\ncalculate these rotational-tidal deformations assuming the stars are rotating\nslowly and the tides are weak and quasi-stationary. The stellar multipole\nmoments are read off from an asymptotically flat metric that encodes the\ndifference between their tidal response and a black hole's. The multipoles are\nsubsequently inserted into post-Newtonian formulas for the orbit and the\ngravitational radiation. We find that, at leading order, the rotational-tidal\ndeformations make a 6.5PN contribution to the tidal phase. Their effect on the\nwaveform is thus larger than that of the mass octupoles, and nearly as large as\nthat of the current quadrupoles, in systems with non-negligible spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 17:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-07"}

However, for missing data generated by\nmissing not at random (MNAR) mechanisms, MI performed assuming MAR might not be\nsatisfactory. For an incomplete variable in a given dataset, its corresponding\npopulation marginal distribution might also be available in an external data\nsource. We show how this information can be readily utilised in the imputation\nmodel to calibrate inference to the population, by incorporating an\nappropriately calculated offset termed the `calibrated-$\\delta$ adjustment'. We\ndescribe the derivation of this offset from the population distribution of the\nincomplete variable and show how in applications it can be used to closely (and\noften exactly) match the post-imputation distribution to the population level.\nThrough analytic and simulation studies, we show that our proposed\ncalibrated-$\\delta$ adjustment MI method can give the same inference as\nstandard MI when data are MAR, and can produce more accurate inference under\ntwo general MNAR missingness mechanisms. The method is used to impute missing\nethnicity data in a type 2 diabetes prevalence case study using UK primary care\nelectronic health records, where it results in scientifically relevant changes\nin inference for non-White ethnic groups compared to standard MI.\nCalibrated-$\\delta$ adjustment MI represents a pragmatic approach for utilising\navailable population-level information in a sensitivity analysis to explore\npotential departure from the MAR assumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 17:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

The current paradigm is that the corona is heated by\nnanoflares, which were originally proposed as miniature versions of the\nobserved solar flares. It was recently suggested that the nanoflares could be\nidentified as annihilation events of the nuggets from the Axion Quark Nugget\n(AQN) dark matter model. This model was invented as an explanation of the\nobserved ratio $\\Omega_{\\rm dark} \\sim \\Omega_{\\rm visible}$, based only on\ncosmological and particle physics considerations. In this new paradigm, the AQN\nparticles moving through the coronal plasma and annihilating with normal matter\ncan lead to the drastic change of temperatures seen in the Sun's Transition\nRegion (TR), and significantly contribute to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)\nexcess of $10^{27}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. To test this proposal, we perform\nnumerical simulations with a realistically modeled AQN particle distribution\nand explore how the nuggets interact with the coronal plasma. Remarkably, our\nsimulations predict the correct energy budget for the solar corona, and show\nthat the energy injection mostly occurs at an altitude of around 2000 km, which\nis where the TR lies. Therefore, we propose that these long unresolved\nmysteries could be two sides of the same coin. We make several predictions\nbased on this proposal, some of which could be tested by the recently launched\nNASA mission, the Parker Solar Probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 18:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

In accord with the self-shadowing hypothesis recently proposed by Debes\net al., we find that the total and polarized intensity of the disk exhibits\nstrong azimuthal asymmetries at projected distances consistent with the\npreviously reported bright and dark ring-shaped structures (~45-99 au). The\nsinusoidal-like variations possess a maximum brightness at position angles near\n~268-300 degrees and are up to ~28% stronger in total intensity. Furthermore,\nsignificant radial and azimuthal variations are also detected in the\npolarization fraction of the disk.

Moreover, we find\nstrong (~20%) azimuthal variation in the polarization fraction along the\nshadowed region of the disk.

We present designs\nof superconducting optoelectronic neurons based on superconducting\nsingle-photon detectors, Josephson junctions, semiconductor light sources, and\nmulti-planar dielectric waveguides. These circuits achieve complex synaptic and\nneuronal functions with high energy efficiency, leveraging the strengths of\nlight for communication and superconducting electronics for computation. The\nneurons send few-photon signals to synaptic connections. These signals\ncommunicate neuronal firing events as well as update synaptic weights.\nSpike-timing-dependent plasticity is implemented with a single photon\ntriggering each step of the process. Microscale light-emitting diodes and\nwaveguide networks enable connectivity from a neuron to thousands of synaptic\nconnections, and the use of light for communication enables synchronization of\nneurons across an area limited only by the distance light can travel within the\nperiod of a network oscillation. Experimentally, each of the requisite circuit\nelements has been demonstrated, yet a hardware platform combining them all has\nnot been attempted. Compared to digital logic or quantum computing, device\ntolerances are relaxed. For this neural application, optical sources providing\nincoherent pulses with 10,000 photons produced with efficiency of 10$^{-3}$\noperating at 20\\,MHz at 4.2\\,K are sufficient to enable a massively scalable\nneural computing platform with connectivity comparable to the brain and thirty\nthousand times higher speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 22:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 17:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Modern DRAMs have multiple banks to serve multiple memory\nrequests in parallel. However, when two requests go to the same bank, they have\nto be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of on-chip memory. Adding\nmore banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. Our\ngoal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks\nwith a low-cost approach. To this end, we propose three new mechanisms, SALP-1,\nSALP-2, and MASA (Multitude of Activated Subarrays), to reduce the\nserialization of different requests that go to the same bank. The key\nobservation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern DRAM bank is\nimplemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently\nwhile sharing few global peripheral structures.\n  Our three proposed mechanisms mitigate the negative impact of bank\nserialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies\nof multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank.\nSALP-1 requires no changes to the existing DRAM structure, and needs to only\nreinterpret some of the existing DRAM timing parameters. SALP-2 and MASA\nrequire only modest changes (< 0.15% area overhead) to the DRAM peripheral\nstructures, which are much less design constrained than the DRAM core. Our\nevaluations show that SALP-1, SALP-2 and MASA significantly improve performance\nfor both single-core systems (7%/13%/17%) and multi-core systems (15%/16%/20%),\naveraged across a wide range of workloads.

For the comparison we consider a sample of $54$ clusters which\nare a subsample of the second Planck catalogue of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sources.\nWe first compare the $Y$ estimates of the three models, and find that the PM\ngenerally yields lower estimates relative to the OMs. We then compute the Earth\nMover's Distance between the $\\theta$ - $Y$ posterior distributions obtained\nfrom each model for each cluster, and find that the two models which are most\ndiscrepant are PM and OM I. Finally, we compare the Bayesian evidence values\nobtained from each model for each cluster.

To improve Tor performance, we propose\nPredicTor, a path selection technique that uses a Random Forest classifier\ntrained on recent measurements of Tor to predict the performance of a proposed\npath. If the path is predicted to be fast, then the client builds a circuit\nusing those relays. We implemented PredicTor in the Tor source code and show\nthrough live Tor experiments and Shadow simulations that PredicTor improves Tor\nnetwork performance by 11% to 23% compared to Vanilla Tor and by 7% to 13%\ncompared to the previous state-of-the-art scheme. Our experiments show that\nPredicTor is the first path selection algorithm to dynamically avoid highly\ncongested nodes during times of high congestion and avoid long-distance paths\nduring times of low congestion. We evaluate the anonymity of PredicTor using\nstandard entropy-based and time-to-first-compromise metrics, but these cannot\ncapture the possibility of leakage due to the use of location in path\nselection. To better address this, we propose a new anonymity metric called\nCLASI: Client Autonomous System Inference.

As a result, the \"selling point\" of traditional spinning Hard Disk\nDrives (HDDs) as a backend storage - low cost and large capacity - is no longer\nunique, and eventually they will be replaced by low-end SSDs which have large\ncapacity but perform orders of magnitude better than HDDs. Thus, it is widely\nbelieved that all-flash multi-tier storage systems will be adopted in the\nenterprise datacenters in the near future. However, existing caching or tiering\nsolutions for SSD-HDD hybrid storage systems are not suitable for all-flash\nstorage systems. This is because that all-flash storage systems do not have a\nlarge speed difference (e.g., 10x) among each tier. Instead, different\nspecialties (such as high performance, high capacity, etc.) of each tier should\nbe taken into consideration. Motivated by this, we develop an automatic data\nplacement manager called \"AutoTiering\" to handle virtual machine disk files\n(VMDK) allocation and migration in an all-flash multi-tier datacenter to best\nutilize the storage resource, optimize the performance, and reduce the\nmigration overhead. AutoTiering is based on an optimization framework, whose\ncore technique is to predict VM's performance change on different tiers with\ndifferent specialties without conducting real migration.

Conventionally, compression techniques are used to reduce the\nload of communication by combining intermediate results of the same computation\ntask as much as possible. Recently, via the development of coded distributed\ncomputing (CDC), it has been shown that it is possible to enable coding\nopportunities across intermediate results of different computation tasks to\nfurther reduce the communication load. We propose a new scheme, named\ncompressed coded distributed computing (in short, compressed CDC), which\njointly exploits the above two techniques (i.e., combining the intermediate\nresults of the same computation and coding across the intermediate results of\ndifferent computations) to significantly reduce the communication load for\ncomputations with linear aggregation (reduction) of intermediate results in the\nfinal stage that are prevalent in machine learning (e.g., distributed training\nalgorithms where partial gradients are computed distributedly and then averaged\nin the final stage). In particular, compressed CDC first compresses/combines\nseveral intermediate results for a single computation, and then utilizes\nmultiple such combined packets to create a coded multicast packet that is\nsimultaneously useful for multiple computations. We characterize the achievable\ncommunication load of compressed CDC and show that it substantially outperforms\nboth combining methods and CDC scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 May 2018 03:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

It is shown that if (a) $3\\times 3$ Majorana neutrino matrix $M_\\nu$\nis invariant under a discrete $Z_2\\times Z_2$ symmetry generated by $S_{1,2}$,\n(b) CP symmetry $X$ transform $M_\\nu$ as $X^T M_\\nu X=M_\\nu^*$, and (c) $X$ and\n$S_{1,2}$ obey consistency conditions $X S_{1,2}^* X^\\dagger=S_{2,1}$, then two\nof the neutrino masses are degenerate independent of specific forms of $X$,\n$S_1$ and $S_2$. Explicit examples of this result are discussed in the context\nof $\\Delta(6 n^2)$ groups which can also be used to constrain neutrino mixing\nmatrix $U$. Degeneracy in two of the masses does not allow complete\ndetermination of $U$ but it can also be fixed once the perturbations are\nintroduced. We consider explicit perturbations which break $Z_2\\times Z_2$\nsymmetries but respect CP. These are shown to remove the degeneracy and provide\na predictive description of neutrino spectrum. In particular, a correlation\n$\\sin 2\\theta_{23}\\sin\\delta_{CP}=\\pm {\\rm Im}[p]$ is obtained between the\natmospheric mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ and the CP violating phase $\\delta_{CP}$\nin terms of a group theoretically determined phase factor $p$.

Radiative\nspin-polarization is a manifestation of quantum radiation reaction affecting\nthe spin-dynamics of electrons. We recently proposed that an analogue of the\nSokolov-Ternov effect could occur in the strong electromagnetic fields of\nultra-high-intensity lasers, which would result in a build-up of\nspin-polarization in femtoseconds. In this paper we develop a density matrix\nformalism for describing beam polarization in strong electromagnetic fields. We\nstart by using the density matrix formalism to study spin-flips in non-linear\nCompton scattering and its dependence on the initial polarization state of the\nelectrons. Numerical calculations show a radial polarization of the scattered\nelectron beam in a circularly polarized laser, and we find azimuthal\nasymmetries in the polarization patterns for ultra-short laser pulses. A degree\nof polarization approaching 9 % is achieved after emitting just a single\nphoton. We develop the theory by deriving a local constant crossed field\napproximation (LCFA) for the polarization density matrix, which is a\ngeneralization of the well known LCFA scattering rates. We find spin-dependent\nexpressions that may be included in electromagnetic charged-particle simulation\ncodes, such as particle-in-cell plasma simulation codes, using Monte-Carlo\nmodules. In particular, these expressions include the spin-flip rates for\narbitrary initial polarization of the electrons.

As a solution, various studies proposed\nsegmenting words into sub-word units and performing translation at the\nsub-lexical level. However, statistical word segmentation methods have recently\nshown to be prone to morphological errors, which can lead to inaccurate\ntranslations. In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by replacing\nthe source-language embedding layer of NMT with a bi-directional recurrent\nneural network that generates compositional representations of the input at any\ndesired level of granularity. We test our approach in a low-resource setting\nwith five languages from different morphological typologies, and under\ndifferent composition assumptions. By training NMT to compose word\nrepresentations from character n-grams, our approach consistently outperforms\n(from 1.71 to 2.48 BLEU points) NMT learning embeddings of statistically\ngenerated sub-word units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 May 2018 10:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

These\nquasibound states exhibit a discrete scaling symmetry, i.e., the energy ratio\nbetween two successive states is a constant. Through the calculation of the\nenergy spectrum directly, we find that in two dimension an applied magnetic\nfield can shift or even destroy the quasibound states around the Dirac point\nand their discrete scaling symmetry disappears. However, as the magnetic field\nincreases, the remaining quasibound states are pushed up to the Dirac point.\nWhen one quasibound state is close to the Dirac point, the spectrum is modified\nsignificantly, due to the resonant scattering.

However, with present detectors only\nthe mass-weighted combination of the components of the spin along the orbital\nangular momentum can be measured accurately. This quantity, the effective spin\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is conserved up to at least the second post-Newtonian\norder. The measured distribution of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ values from a\npopulation of detected binaries, and in particular whether this distribution is\nsymmetric about zero, encodes valuable information about the underlying\ncompact-binary formation channels. In this paper we focus on two important\ncomplications of using the effective spin to study astrophysical population\nproperties: (i) an astrophysical distribution for $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ values\nwhich is symmetric does not necessarily lead to a symmetric distribution for\nthe detected effective spin values, leading to a \\emph{selection bias}; and\n(ii) the posterior distribution of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for individual events\nis \\emph{asymmetric} and it cannot usually be treated as a Gaussian.

AL-DRAM is a mechanism that optimizes DRAM latency based on the DRAM\nmodule and the operating temperature, by exploiting the extra margin that is\nbuilt into the DRAM timing parameters. DRAM manufacturers provide a large\nmargin for the timing parameters as a provision against two worst-case\nscenarios. First, due to process variation, some outlier DRAM chips are much\nslower than others. Second, chips become slower at higher temperatures. The\ntiming parameter margin ensures that the slow outlier chips operate reliably at\nthe worst-case temperature, and hence leads to a high access latency.\n  Using an FPGA-based DRAM testing platform, our work first characterizes the\nextra margin for 115 DRAM modules from three major manufacturers. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that it is possible to reduce four of the most\ncritical timing parameters by a minimum/maximum of 17.3%/54.8% at 55C while\nmaintaining reliable operation. AL-DRAM uses these observations to adaptively\nselect reliable DRAM timing parameters for each DRAM module based on the\nmodule's current operating conditions. AL-DRAM does not require any changes to\nthe DRAM chip or its interface; it only requires multiple different timing\nparameters to be specified and supported by the memory controller. Our real\nsystem evaluations show that AL-DRAM improves the performance of\nmemory-intensive workloads by an average of 14% without introducing any errors.\nOur characterization and proposed techniques have inspired several other works\non analyzing and/or exploiting different sources of latency and performance\nvariation within DRAM chips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2018 19:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The capacity and cost-per-bit of DRAM have historically scaled to\nsatisfy the needs of increasingly large and complex computer systems. However,\nDRAM latency has remained almost constant, making memory latency the\nperformance bottleneck in today's systems. We observe that the high access\nlatency is not intrinsic to DRAM, but a trade-off is made to decrease the cost\nper bit. To mitigate the high area overhead of DRAM sensing structures,\ncommodity DRAMs connect many DRAM cells to each sense amplifier through a wire\ncalled a bitline. These bit-lines have a high parasitic capacitance due to\ntheir long length, and this bitline capacitance is the dominant source of DRAM\nlatency. Specialized low-latency DRAMs use shorter bitlines with fewer cells,\nbut have a higher cost-per-bit due to greater sense amplifier area overhead. To\nachieve both low latency and low cost per bit, we introduce Tiered-Latency DRAM\n(TL-DRAM). In TL-DRAM, each long bitline is split into two shorter segments by\nan isolation transistor, allowing one of the two segments to be accessed with\nthe latency of a short-bitline DRAM without incurring a high cost per bit. We\npropose mechanisms that use the low-latency segment as a hardware-managed or\nsoftware-managed cache. Our evaluations show that our proposed mechanisms\nimprove both performance and energy efficiency for both single-core and\nmultiprogrammed workloads.

BSMs contain data about the sending vehicle's\nstate, such as speed, location, and the status of the turn signal. Currently,\nmany BSM datasets are available through the connected vehicle testbeds of U.S.\nDepartment of Transportation from all over the country. However, without a\nproper visualization tool, it is not possible to analyze or visually get an\noverview of the spatio-temporal distribution of the data. With this goal, a web\napplication has been developed which can ingest a raw BSM dataset and display a\ntime-based simulation of vehicle movement. The simulation also displays\nmulti-hop vehicular network connectivity over DSRC. This paper gives details\nabout the application, including an explanation of the multi-hop partitioning\nalgorithm used to classify the vehicles into separate network partitions. A\nperformance analysis for the simulation is included, in which it is suggested\nthat calculating a connectivity matrix with the multi-hop partitioning\nalgorithm is computationally expensive for large number of vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 May 2018 14:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}
