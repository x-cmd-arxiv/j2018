This decomposition gives a dynamic\nprogram for counting the homomorphisms of $H$ in $G$ by exploiting the\ndegeneracy of $G$, which allows us to beat the state-of-the-art subgraph\ncounting algorithms when $G$ is sparse enough.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as\nfully convolutional network (FCN) and SegNet, have shown outstanding\nperformance in many segmentation tasks. One key pillar of these successes is\nmining useful information from features in convolutional layers for producing\nhigh resolution segmentation maps. For example, FCN nonlinearly combines\nhigh-level features extracted from last convolutional layers; whereas SegNet\nutilizes a deconvolutional network which takes as input only coarse, high-level\nfeature maps of the last convolutional layer. However, how to better fuse\nmulti-level convolutional feature maps for semantic segmentation of remote\nsensing images is underexplored.

While many deterministic studies clarified these\nadvantageous features in the mean sense, a closed-form statistical model is\nindispensable for determining the tail probability of failure in the range of 1\nin a million, which is what is demanded for most engineering applications. In\nthe authors' preceding study, the so-called `fishnet' statistics, exemplified\nby a diagonally pulled fishnet, was conceived to describe the probability\ndistribution. The fishnet links, representing interlaminar bonds, were\nconsidered to be elastic perfectly-brittle.

This paper extends the fishnet statistics to links with\npost-peak softening slope of arbitrary steepness. Probabilistic analysis is\nenabled by assuming the postpeak softening of a link to occur as a series of\nfinite drops of stress and stiffness. The maximum load of the structure is\napproximated by the strength of the k-th weakest link (k >= 1), and the\ndistribution of structure strength is expressed as a weighted sum of the\ndistributions of order statistics. The analytically obtained probabilities are\ncompared and verified by histograms of strength data obtained by millions of\nMonte Carlo simulations for each of many nacreous bodies with different link\nsoftening steepness and with various overall shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2018 02:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The novelty, in\nrelation to previous versions of the $q$-voter model, is memory possessed by\neach agent and external noise $T$, which plays the role of social temperature.\nEach agent has its own memories of past experiences related to the social costs\nand benefits of being independent or conformist.

We will show that depending on the\nsocial temperature $T$ the system spontaneously organizes into one of two\nregimes. Below a certain critical social temperature $T_c$, all agents in the\nsociety acquire personal traits (so called person state).

This\nmeans that initially homogeneous population becomes heterogeneous, and agents\nrespond differently to social influence.

Histogram specification (HS) is one of\nthe most widely used techniques for contrast enhancement of an image, which\nrequires an appropriate probability density function for the transformation. In\nthis paper, we propose a fuzzy method to find a suitable PDF automatically for\nhistogram specification using interval type - 2 (IT2) fuzzy approach, based on\nthe fuzzy membership values obtained from the histogram of input image. The\nproposed algorithm works in 5 stages which includes - symmetric Gaussian\nfitting on the histogram, extraction of IT2 fuzzy membership functions (MFs)\nand therefore, footprint of uncertainty (FOU), obtaining membership value (MV),\ngenerating PDF and application of HS. We have proposed 4 different methods to\nfind membership values - point-wise method, center of weight method, area\nmethod, and karnik-mendel (KM) method. The framework is sensitive to local\nvariations in the histogram and chooses the best PDF so as to improve contrast\nenhancement. Experimental validity of the methods used is illustrated by\nqualitative and quantitative analysis on several images using the image quality\nindex - Average Information Content (AIC) or Entropy, and by comparison with\nthe commonly used algorithms such as Histogram Equalization (HE), Recursive\nMean-Separate Histogram Equalization (RMSHE) and Brightness Preserving Fuzzy\nHistogram Equalization (BPFHE).

The result is obtained by reducing RDTPs to\nthe Single-Source Shortest-Paths (SSSP) and the 2-SAT problem (jointly),\ninstead of reducing to CRCs. In passing, we obtain a faster (quadratic-time)\nalgorithm for RDTPs having only Type-1 and Type-2 constraints (and no Type-3\nconstraint). As a second main contribution, we study the tractability frontier\nof solving RDTPs by considering Hyper Temporal Networks (\\HTNs), a strict\ngeneralization of \\STNs grounded on hypergraphs: on one side, we prove that\nsolving temporal problems having only Type-2 constraints and either only\nmulti-tail or only multi-head hyperarc constraints lies in both NP and co-NP\nand it admits deterministic pseudo-polynomial time algorithms; on the other\nside, solving problems with Type-3 constraints and either only multi-tail or\nonly multi-head hyperarc constraints turns strongly NP-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2018 10:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 10:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 19:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

Many\nordered indexes, such as B+ tree and skip list, have a O(log N) lookup cost,\nwhere N is number of keys in an index. For an ordered index hosting billions of\nkeys, it may take more than 30 key-comparisons in a lookup, which is an order\nof magnitude more expensive than that on a hash table. With availability of\nlarge memory and fast network in today's data centers, this O(log N) time is\ntaking a heavy toll on applications that rely on ordered indexes.\n  In this paper we introduce a new ordered index structure, named Wormhole,\nthat takes O(log L) worst-case time for looking up a key with a length of L.\nThe low cost is achieved by simultaneously leveraging strengths of three\nindexing structures, namely hash table, prefix tree, and B+ tree, to\norchestrate a single fast ordered index. Wormhole's range operations can be\nperformed by a linear scan of a list after an initial lookup. This improvement\nof access efficiency does not come at a price of compromised space efficiency.\nInstead, Wormhole's index space is comparable to those of B+ tree and skip\nlist. Experiment results show that Wormhole outperforms skip list, B+ tree,\nART, and Masstree by up to 8.4x, 4.9x, 4.3x, and 6.6x in terms of key lookup\nthroughput, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2018 12:31:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 03:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

For a\nspatially flat FRW universe filled with pressureless dark matter and DBI dark\nenergy, we first obtain the evolutionary behaviors of the background\nquantities. Our results show that in our DBI model, the universe starts from a\nmatter dominated epoch and approaches to the de Sitter universe at late times,\nas expected. Also the DBI potential behaves like the power law one\n$V(\\phi)\\propto \\phi^n$.\n  In addition, we use the Pseudo-Newtonian formalism to obtain the growth\nfactor of dark matter perturbations in the linear regime. We conclude that for\nsmaller $c_s$ (or $f_0$), the growth factor of dark matter is smaller for\nclustering DBI model compared to the homogeneous one.

Characterization of\nthe reactions products (hydrogenated and deuterated graphene) was carried out\nby thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS) and Raman\nspectroscopy including statistical Raman spectroscopy (SRS) and -microscopy\n(SRM). The results reveal that the choice of the hydrogen/deuterium source, the\nnature of the graphite (used as starting material), the potassium concentration\nin the intercalation compound as well as the choice of the solvent have a great\nimpact on the reaction outcome. Furthermore, it was possible to proof that both\nmono and few-layer hydrogenated/deuterated graphene can be produced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2018 06:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}
