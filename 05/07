In this work, we contend\nthat these tasks do not adequately meet the needs of citizen scientists\nmotivated by scientific learning. We propose to provide intrinsic motivation by\nasking them to no- tice, compare, and synthesize qualitative observations. We\ndescribe the process of learning and performing qualitative assessments in the\ndomain of water quality monitoring, which appraises the impact of land use on\nhabitat quality and biological diversity. We use the example of water\nmonitoring because qualitative wa- tershed assessments are exclusively\nperformed by professionals, yet do not require specialized tools, making it an\nexcellent fit for volunteers. Within this domain, we observe and report on\ndifferences in background and training between professional and volunteer\nmonitors, using these experiences to synthesize findings about volunteer\ntraining needs. Our findings reveal that to successfully make qualitative\nstream assessments, vol- unteers need to: (1) experience a diverse range of\nstreams, (2) discuss judgments with other monitors, and (3) construct internal\nnarratives about water quality. We use our findings to describe how different\ntechnologies may support these needs and generalize our findings to the larger\ncitizen science community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 13:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

For the strongest existing bounds on\nthe graviton mass, the memory is essentially wiped out for the sources located\nat distances above 10 Mpc. On the other hand, for the weaker bounds found in\nthe LIGO observations, the memory is reduced to zero for distances above 0.1\nPc.

We\nevaluate the performance of our model with multiple metrics.

We observed CS Cha with the high contrast imager VLT/SPHERE in\npolarimetric differential imaging mode to resolve the circumbinary disk in near\ninfrared scattered light. These observations were followed-up by VLT/NACO\nL-band observations and complemented by archival VLT/NACO K-band and HST/WFPC2\nI-band data.

We have found that the underlying cause of the flying ice\ncube effect is a violation of balance leading to systematic redistributions of\nkinetic energy under simple velocity rescaling and the Berendsen thermostat.\nWhen velocities are instead rescaled to the canonical ensemble's kinetic energy\ndistribution, as is done with the CSVR thermostat, the equipartition theorem is\nnot violated, and we show that the CSVR thermostat satisfies detailed balance.\nThe critical necessity for molecular dynamics practitioners to abandon the use\nof popular yet incorrect velocity rescaling algorithms is underscored with an\nexample demonstrating that the main result of a highly-cited study is entirely\ndue to artifacts resulting from the study's use of the Berendsen thermostat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2018 23:51:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 19:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

This scaling behaviour arises when these\nspectra are presented in terms of a suitable variable, $z=p_{\\rm{T}}/K$. The\nscaling parameter $K$ is determined by the quality factor method and is\nparameterized by $a \\langle N_{\\rm{part}}\\rangle^{b}$, where $\\langle\nN_{\\rm{part}}\\rangle$ is the average value of the number of participating\nnucleons, $a$ and $b$ are free parameters, $b$ characterizes the rate at which\n$\\textrm{ln} K$ changes with $\\textrm{ln} \\langle N_{\\rm{part}}\\rangle$. The\nvalues of $b$ for pions and kaons are consistent within uncertainties, while\nthey are smaller than that for protons. In the high $p_{\\rm{T}}$ region, due to\nthe suppression of the spectra, a violation of the proposed scaling is observed\ngoing from central to peripheral collisions. The more peripheral the collisions\nare, the more clearly violated the proposed scaling becomes. In the framework\nof the colour string percolation model, we argue that the pions, kaons and\nprotons originate from the fragmentation of clusters which are formed by\nstrings overlapping and the cluster's fragmentation functions are different for\ndifferent hadrons. The scaling behaviour of the pion, kaon and proton spectra\nin the low $p_{\\rm T}$ region can be simultaneously explained by the colour\nstring percolation model in a qualitative way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 00:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

To reduce the overcrowding and waiting\ntime of ED, we build a classifier to predict the disposition of patients using\nmanually-typed nurse notes collected during triage, thereby allowing hospital\nstaff to begin necessary preparation beforehand. However, these triage notes\ninvolve high dimensional, noisy, and also sparse text data which makes model\nfitting and interpretation difficult.

This result suggests not only the robustness of the appearance of\ndiverging flux in instantaneous limits of DCE but also that the type of\ndivergence sensitively depends on the combination of initial and final BCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 06:55:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Most current predictions are based on the\nMaxwellian approximation which is not only theoretically inconsistent in\nbounded systems, but also not supported by cosmological simulations. A more\nconsistent method sometimes used in calculations for direct WIMP searches\nrelies on the so-called Eddington inversion method, which relates the DM\nphase-space distribution function (DF) to its mass density profile and the\ntotal gravitational potential of the system. Originally built upon the isotropy\nassumption, this method can be extended to anisotropic systems. We investigate\nthese inversion methods in the context of Galactic DM searches, motivated by\nthe fact that the MW is a strongly constrained system, and should be even more\nso with the ongoing Gaia survey. We still draw conclusions that apply to the\ngeneral case. In particular, we illustrate how neglecting the radial boundary\nof the DM halo leads to theoretical inconsistencies. We also show that several\nrealistic configurations of the DM halo and the MW baryonic content entail\nill-defined DFs, significantly restricting the configuration space over which\nthese inversion methods can apply. We propose consistent solutions to these\nissues. Finally, we compute several observables inferred from constrained\nGalactic mass models relevant to DM searches (WIMPs or PBHs), {\\em e.g.}\nmoments and inverse moments of the DM speed and relative speed distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 08:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

In this paper, we consider so-called complex ranking\nsettings where it is not clear what should be displayed, that is, what the\nrelevant items are, and how they should be displayed, that is, where the most\nrelevant items should be placed. These ranking settings are complex as they\ninvolve both traditional ranking and inferring the best display order. Existing\nlearning to rank methods cannot handle such complex ranking settings as they\nassume that the display order is known beforehand. To address this gap we\nintroduce a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning method that is capable of\nlearning complex rankings, both the layout and the best ranking given the\nlayout, from weak reward signals. Our proposed method does so by selecting\ndocuments and positions sequentially, hence it ranks both the documents and\npositions, which is why we call it the Double-Rank Model (DRM). Our experiments\nshow that DRM outperforms all existing methods in complex ranking settings,\nthus it leads to substantial ranking improvements in cases where the display\norder is not known a priori.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 08:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

We examine non-negativity constraints on entity\nrepresentations and approximate entailment constraints on relation\nrepresentations.

In particular, it has been argued that it is an appropriate\nmodel to describe the cuprate high-Tc superconductors. It turns out that a\ncomprehensive understanding of the gamut of physics encoded by the t-J model is\nstill an open problem. In recent years some remarkable experiments on the\ncuprates, for example, discovery of nodeless superconductivity in underdoped\nsamples (PNAS 109, 18332 (2012)), discovery of s-wave like gap in the pseudogap\nphase (Phys.

A significant challenge for periodic gossip\nalgorithms is difficult to predict the convergence rate for large-scale\nnetworks. To facilitate the convergence rate evaluation, we study a\none-dimensional lattice network model.

By\nproposing an algorithm to construct $n-1$ internally disjoint paths in\n$B_{n-1,k-1}$, we show that $\\kappa_{3}(B_{n,k})=n-2$ for $2\\leq k\\leq n-1$,\nwhich generalizes the known result about the bubble-sort graph $B_{n}$ [Applied\nMathematics and Computation 274 (2016) 41-46] given by Li $et$ $al.$, as the\nbubble-sort graph $B_{n}$ is the special $(n,k)$-bubble-sort graph for $k=n-1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 10:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

Its long-term goal is in the development\nof beyond-Moore low dissipation technology devices. Recent progress\ndemonstrated the long-distance transport of spin signals across ferromagnetic\ninsulators. Antiferromagnetically ordered materials are however the most common\nclass of magnetic materials with several crucial advantages over ferromagnetic\nsystems. In contrast to the latter, antiferromagnets exhibit no net magnetic\nmoment, which renders them stable and impervious to external fields. In\naddition, they can be operated at THz frequencies. While fundamentally their\nproperties bode well for spin transport, previous indirect observations\nindicate that spin transmission through antiferromagnets is limited to short\ndistances of a few nanometers. Here we demonstrate the long-distance, over tens\nof micrometers, propagation of spin currents through hematite (\\alpha-Fe2O3),\nthe most common antiferromagnetic iron oxide, exploiting the spin Hall effect\nfor spin injection. We control the spin current flow by the interfacial\nspin-bias and by tuning the antiferromagnetic resonance frequency with an\nexternal magnetic field. This simple antiferromagnetic insulator is shown to\nconvey spin information parallel to the compensated moment (N\\'eel order) over\ndistances exceeding tens of micrometers. This newly-discovered mechanism\ntransports spin as efficiently as the net magnetic moments in the best-suited\ncomplex ferromagnets.

Recent works\nhave demonstrated the superiority of simultaneous feature representations and\nhash functions learning with deep neural networks. However, most existing deep\nhashing methods directly learn the hash functions by encoding the global\nsemantic information, while ignoring the local spatial information of images.\nThe loss of local spatial structure makes the performance bottleneck of hash\nfunctions, therefore limiting its application for accurate similarity\nretrieval. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Ordinal Hashing (DOH) method,\nwhich learns ordinal representations by leveraging the ranking structure of\nfeature space from both local and global views. In particular, to effectively\nbuild the ranking structure, we propose to learn the rank correlation space by\nexploiting the local spatial information from Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)\nand the global semantic information from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nsimultaneously. More specifically, an effective spatial attention model is\ndesigned to capture the local spatial information by selectively learning\nwell-specified locations closely related to target objects. In such hashing\nframework,the local spatial and global semantic nature of images are captured\nin an end-to-end ranking-to-hashing manner.

The exploitation of this exfoliated material in cutting-edge\ntechnologies, e.g., in flexible electronics and energy storage, is however\nlimited by the fact that the LPE of BP is usually carried out at a high boiling\npoint and in toxic solvents. In fact, the solvent residual is detrimental to\ndevice performance in real applications; thus, complete solvent removal is\ncritical. Here, we tackle these issues by exfoliating BP in different low\nboiling-point solvents. Among these solvents, we find that acetone also\nprovides a high concentration of exfoliated BP, leading to the production of\nFL-BP flakes with an average lateral size and thickness of c.a. 30 and 7 nm,\nrespectively. The use of acetone to produce less defective few-layer BP flakes\n(FL-BPacetone) from bulk crystals is a straightforward process which enables\nthe rapid preparation of homogeneous thin films thanks to the fast solvent\nevaporation. The ratio of edge to bulk atoms for the BP flakes here produced,\ncombined with the use of low-boiling-point solvents for the exfoliation process\nsuggests that these thin films are promising anodes for lithium-ion batteries.\nTo this end, we tested Li-ion half cells with FL-BPacetone anodes achieving a\nreversible specific capacity of 480 mAh/g at a current density of 100 mA/g,\nover 100 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, a reversible specific capacity of\n345 mAh/g is achieved for the FL-BPacetone-based anode at a high current\ndensity (i.e., 1 A/g). These findings indicate that the FL-BPacetone-based\nbattery is promising with regards to the design of fast charge/discharge\ndevices. Overall, the presented process is a step forward toward the\nfabrication of phosphorene-based devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 12:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

We perform a detailed observational analysis of network jets to\nunderstand their kinematics, rotational motion and underlying triggering\nmechanism(s). We have analyzed the quiet-Sun (QS) data. Methods. IRIS high\nresolution imaging and spectral observations (SJI: Si iv 1400.0 \\AA, Raster: Si\niv 1393.75 \\AA) are used to analyze the omnipresent rotating network jets in\nthe transition-region (TR). In addition, we have also used Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamic Observation (SDO) observations. Results.\nThe statistical analysis of fifty-one network jets is performed to understand\nvarious their mean properties, e.g., apparent speed (140.16+/-39.41 km/s),\nlength (3.16+/-1.18 Mm), lifetimes (105.49+/-51.75 s). The Si iv 1393.75 \\AA\nline has secondary component along with its main Gaussian, which is formed due\nto the high-speed plasma flows (i.e., network jets). The variation of Doppler\nvelocity across these jets (i.e., blue shift on one edge and red shift on the\nother) signify the presence of inherited rotational motion. The statistical\nanalysis predicts that the mean rotational velocity (i.e., \\delV) is 49.56\nkm/s. The network jets have high angular velocity in comparison to the other\nclass of solar jets. Conclusions. The signature of network jets are inherited\nin TR spectral lines in terms of the secondary component of the Si iv 1393.75\n\\AA line. The rotational motion of network jets is omnipresent, which is\nreported firstly for this class of jet-like features.

In this paper, we give a geometric characterization of the robustness\nof shape-restricted least squares estimators (LSEs) to error distributions with\nan $L_{2,1}$ moment, in terms of the `localized envelopes' of the model.\n  This envelope perspective gives a systematic approach to proving oracle\ninequalities for the LSEs in shape-restricted regression problems in the random\ndesign setting, under a minimal $L_{2,1}$ moment assumption on the errors. The\ncanonical isotonic and convex regression models, and a more challenging\nadditive regression model with shape constraints are studied in detail.\nStrikingly enough, in the additive model both the adaptation and robustness\nproperties of the LSE can be preserved, up to error distributions with an\n$L_{2,1}$ moment, for estimating the shape-constrained proxy of the marginal\n$L_2$ projection of the true regression function. This holds essentially\nregardless of whether or not the additive model structure is correctly\nspecified.\n  The new envelope perspective goes beyond shape constrained models. Indeed, at\na general level, the localized envelopes give a sharp characterization of the\nconvergence rate of the $L_2$ loss of the LSE between the worst-case rate as\nsuggested by the recent work of the authors [25], and the best possible\nparametric rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 14:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

Most existing methods use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract spatio-temporal information embedded\nin the skeleton sequences for action recognition. However, these approaches are\nlimited in the ability of relational modeling in a single skeleton, due to the\nloss of important structural information when converting the raw skeleton data\nto adapt to the input format of CNN or RNN. In this paper, we propose an\nAttentional Recurrent Relational Network-LSTM (ARRN-LSTM) to simultaneously\nmodel spatial configurations and temporal dynamics in skeletons for action\nrecognition. We introduce the Recurrent Relational Network to learn the spatial\nfeatures in a single skeleton, followed by a multi-layer LSTM to learn the\ntemporal features in the skeleton sequences. Between the two modules, we design\nan adaptive attentional module to focus attention on the most discriminative\nparts in the single skeleton. To exploit the complementarity from different\ngeometries in the skeleton for sufficient relational modeling, we design a\ntwo-stream architecture to learn the structural features among joints and lines\nsimultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular skeleton\ndatasets and the results show that the proposed approach achieves better\nresults than most mainstream methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 14:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 06:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 12:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

The model reproduces the\napparent reduction of the friction velocity and enhancement of the roughness\nlength estimated from current profiles, detected in a number of studies.

Here we study the temperature effect on the\nseparation via gel agarose chromatography by varying the separation process\ntemperatures between 6C and 50C, for four different SWNT sources. Exploiting\nthe gel agarose micro-beads filtration technique we achieved up to 70% m-SWNTs\nand more than 90% s-SWNTs, independent of the source material. The process is\ntemperature dependent, with improved yields up to 95% for s-SWNT (HiPco) at 6C.\nTemperature affects the sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS surfactant-micelle\ndistribution along the SWNT sidewalls, thus helping to act as an aid in the\nsorting of SWNTs by electronic type. The sorted SWNTs are then used to\nfabricate transistors with very low OFF-currents (10^-13 A), high ON/OFF\ncurrent ratio (>10^6) and improved charge carriers mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 15:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

With the increasing\ncomplexity the existing control system of power system conditions which\nincludes operative actions of the dispatcher and work of special automatic\ndevices proves to be insufficiently effective more and more frequently, which\nraises risks of dangerous and emergency conditions in power systems. The paper\nis aimed at compensating for the shortcomings of man (a cognitive barrier,\nexposure to stresses and so on) and automatic devices by combining their strong\npoints, i.e. the dispatcher's intelligence and the speed of automatic devices\nby virtue of development of the intelligent system \"Artificial dispatcher\" on\nthe basis of deep machine learning technology. For realization of the system\n\"Artificial dispatcher\" in addition to deep learning it is planned to attract\nthe game theory approaches to formalize work of the up-to-date power system as\na game problem. The \"gain\" for \"Artificial dispatcher\" will consist in bringing\nin a power system in the normal steady-state or post-emergency conditions by\nmeans of the required control actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 07:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

The method exploits the original idea of accounting for\nthe shape of roughness as a correction to the normal gap function, rather than\nexplicitly discretizing roughness with higher-order numerical interpolation\nschemes. The resulting interface finite element with eMbedded Profile for Joint\nRoughness (MPJR interface finite element) is derived and its implementation as\na user-defined element is comprehensively described. The method is validated\nagainst Hertzian contact problems between a cylinder and a half-plane, also in\nthe presence of adhesion, showing a remarkable accuracy in spite of the\nlow-order interpolation used. The capability and efficiency of the method are\nsubsequently illustrated in relation to the challenging frictionless normal\ncontact problems between deformable substrates and rough profiles analytically\ndescribed by the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function. This method opens new\nperspectives for the solution of contact problems with roughness using the\nfinite element method that, so far, were strongly limited by the issue of\nproviding an accurate representation of roughness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 08:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}
