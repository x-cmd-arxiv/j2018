Our infinitely many new diffeomorphism types of AC G_2-manifolds are\nparticularly noteworthy: previously the three examples constructed by Bryant\nand Salamon in 1989 furnished the only known simply connected AC G_2-manifolds.\n  We also construct a closely related conically singular G_2 holonomy space:\naway from a single isolated conical singularity, where the geometry becomes\nasymptotic to the G_2-cone over the standard nearly K\\\"ahler structure on the\nproduct of a pair of 3-spheres, the metric is smooth and it has ALC geometry at\ninfinity. We argue that this conically singular ALC G_2-space is the natural\nG_2 analogue of the Taub-NUT metric in 4-dimensional hyperKaehler geometry and\nthat our new AC G_2-metrics are all analogues of the Eguchi-Hanson metric, the\nsimplest ALE hyperK\\\"ahler manifold. Like the Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson\nmetrics, all our examples are cohomogeneity one, i.e. they admit an isometric\nLie group action whose generic orbit has codimension one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 16:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 06:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 14:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

It is important to study the rotation number of the\nsystem as a function $\\rho=\\rho(B,A)$ and to describe the phase-lock areas: its\nlevel sets $L_r=\\{\\rho =r\\}$ with non-empty interiors. They were studied by\nV.M.Buchstaber, O.V.Karpov, S.I.Tertychnyi, who observed in 2010 that the\nphase-lock areas exist only for integer values of the rotation number. It is\nknown that each phase-lock area is a garland of infinitely many bounded domains\ngoing to infinity in the vertical direction; each two subsequent domains are\nseparated by one point called constriction (if it does not lie in the abscissa\naxis). There is a conjecture stating that all the constrictions of every\nphase-lock area $L_r$ lie in its axis $\\Lambda_r=\\{ B=r\\omega\\}$.

In each\niteration, JacSketch efficiently updates the Jacobian matrix by first obtaining\na random linear measurement of the true Jacobian through (cheap) sketching, and\nthen projecting the previous estimate onto the solution space of a linear\nmatrix equation whose solutions are consistent with the measurement. The\nJacobian estimate is then used to compute a variance-reduced unbiased estimator\nof the gradient. Our strategy is analogous to the way quasi-Newton methods\nmaintain an estimate of the Hessian, and hence our method can be seen as a\nstochastic quasi-gradient method. We prove that for smooth and strongly convex\nfunctions, JacSketch converges linearly with a meaningful rate dictated by a\nsingle convergence theorem which applies to general sketches. We also provide a\nrefined convergence theorem which applies to a smaller class of sketches. This\nenables us to obtain sharper complexity results for variants of JacSketch with\nimportance sampling. By specializing our general approach to specific sketching\nstrategies, JacSketch reduces to the stochastic average gradient (SAGA) method,\nand several of its existing and many new minibatch, reduced memory, and\nimportance sampling variants.

Efforts to use\ncosmological perturbation theory to model the dependence of IA on the\nlarge-scale structure have thus far been relatively successful; however, extant\nmodels do not consistently account for time evolution. In particular, advection\nof galaxies due to peculiar velocities alters the impact of IA, because galaxy\npositions when observed are generally different from their positions at the\nepoch when IA is believed to be set. In this work, we evolve the galaxy IA from\nthe time of galaxy formation to the time at which they are observed, including\nthe effects of this advection, and show how this process naturally leads to a\ndependence of IA on the velocity shear.

It\nhas been argued that these models provide an effective, but complete,\ndescription of the evaporation of black holes at all times up to their eventual\ndisappearance. However, here we point out that known models fail to be\nself-consistent: the regular core is exponentially unstable against\nperturbations with a finite timescale, while the evaporation time is infinite,\ntherefore making the instability impossible to prevent.

In this work, we investigate the problem of predicting the\ncategory (domain) of arbitrary networks. This includes complex networks from\ndifferent domains as well as synthetically generated graphs from five different\nnetwork models. A classification accuracy of $96.6\\%$ is achieved using a\nrandom forest classifier with both real and synthetic networks. This work makes\ntwo important findings. First, our results indicate that complex networks from\nvarious domains have distinct structural properties that allow us to predict\nwith high accuracy the category of a new previously unseen network. Second,\nsynthetic graphs are trivial to classify as the classification model can\npredict with near-certainty the network model used to generate it. Overall, the\nresults demonstrate that networks drawn from different domains (and network\nmodels) are trivial to distinguish using only a handful of simple structural\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 18:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 17:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

He showed that the solution to the\nproblem could be obtained trough a system of two linear equations with\nnonlinear coupling at the boundary (Schr\\\"odinger system). Existence and\nuniqueness for such a system, which represents a sort of bottleneck for the\nproblem, was first established by R. Fortet in 1938/40 under rather general\nassumptions by proving convergence of an ingenious but complex approximation\nmethod. It is the first proof of what are nowadays called Sinkhorn-type\nalgorithms in the much more challenging continuous case. Schr\\\"odinger bridges\nare also an early example of the maximum entropy approach and have been more\nrecently recognized as a regularization of the important Optimal Mass Transport\nproblem. Unfortunately, Fortet's contribution is by and large ignored in\ncontemporary literature. This is likely due to the complexity of his approach\ncoupled with an idiosyncratic exposition style and to missing details and steps\nin the proofs. Nevertheless, Fortet's approach maintains its importance to this\nday as it provides the only existing algorithmic proof under rather mild\nassumptions. It can be adapted, in principle, to other relevant problems such\nas the regularized Wasserstein barycenter problem. It is the purpose of this\npaper to remedy this situation by rewriting the bulk of his paper with all the\nmissing passages and in a transparent fashion so as to make it fully available\nto the scientific community.

User mobility impacts network performance as well\nas user perceived service quality. For efficient network dimensioning and\noptimization, it is therefore required to characterize the mobility-aware\nnetwork performance metrics such as the handoff rate, handoff probability,\nsojourn time, direction switch rate, and users' throughput or coverage. This\ncharacterization is particularly challenging for heterogeneous,\ndense/ultra-dense, and random cellular networks such as the emerging 5G and\nbeyond 5G (B5G) networks. In this article, we provide a tutorial on\nmobility-aware performance analysis of both the spatially random and\nnon-random, single-tier and multi-tier cellular networks. We first provide a\nsummary of the different mobility models which include purely random models,\nspatially correlated, and temporally correlated models. The differences among\nvarious mobility models, their statistical properties, and their pros and cons\nare presented. We then describe two main analytical approaches for\nmobility-aware performance analysis of both random and non-random cellular\nnetworks. For the first approach, we describe a general methodology and present\nseveral case studies for different cellular network tessellations such as\nsquare lattice, hexagon lattice, single-tier and multi-tier models in which\nbase-stations (BSs) follow a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP). For the\nsecond approach, we also outline the general methodology. In addition, we\ndiscuss some limitations/imperfections of the existing techniques and provide\ncorrections to these imperfections. Finally, we point out specific 5G\napplication scenarios where the impact of mobility would be significant and\noutline the challenges associated with mobility-aware analysis of those\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 19:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

However, when performing BO on hardware\nfor high-dimensional policies, sample-efficiency can be an issue. Here, we\ndevelop an approach that utilizes simulation to map the original parameter\nspace into a domain-informed space.

Experiments on the ATRIAS robot\nhardware and another bipedal robot simulation show that our approach succeeds\nat sample-efficiently learning controllers for multiple robots. Another\nquestion arises: What if the simulation significantly differs from hardware? To\nanswer this, we create increasingly approximate simulators and study the effect\nof increasing simulation-hardware mismatch on the performance of Bayesian\noptimization. We also compare our approach to other approaches from literature,\nand find it to be more reliable, especially in cases of high mismatch. Our\nexperiments show that our approach succeeds across different controller types,\nbipedal robot models and simulator fidelity levels, making it applicable to a\nwide range of bipedal locomotion problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 20:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

Studies of solar wind\nturbulence have repeatedly demonstrated the impact of discontinuities and\ncoherent structures on the measured spectral index. Whether or not such\ndiscontinuities are self-generated by the turbulence or simply observations of\nadvected structures from the inner heliosphere has been a matter of\nconsiderable debate. This work presents a statistical study of magnetic field\nand velocity spectral indices over 10 years of solar-wind observations; we find\nthat anomalously steep magnetic spectra occur in magnetically dominated\nintervals with negative residual energy. However, this increase in negative\nresidual energy has no noticeable impact on the spectral index of the velocity\nfluctuations, suggesting that these intervals with negative residual energy\ncorrespond to intermittent magnetic structures. We show statistically that the\ndifference between magnetic and velocity spectral indices is a monotonic\nfunction of residual energy, consistent with previous work which suggests that\nintermittency in fluctuations causes spectral steepening. Additionally, a\nstatistical analysis of cross helicity demonstrates that when the turbulence is\nbalanced (low cross-helicity), the magnetic and velocity spectral indices are\nnot equal, which suggests that our observations of negative residual energy and\nintermittent structures are related to non-linear turbulent interactions rather\nthan the presence of advected pre-existing flux-tube structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 20:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Given the complexity of mobile applications and unpredictability of\ndistributed, parallel crowdtesting process, it is difficult to estimate (a) the\nremaining number of bugs as yet undetected or (b) the required cost to find\nthose bugs. Experience-based decisions may result in ineffective crowdtesting\nprocess.\n  This paper aims at exploring automated decision support to effectively manage\ncrowdtesting process. The proposed ISENSE applies incremental sampling\ntechnique to process crowdtesting reports arriving in chronological order,\norganizes them into fixed-size groups as dynamic inputs, and predicts two test\ncompletion indicators in an incrementally manner. The two indicators are:\n1)total number of bugs predicted with Capture-ReCapture (CRC)model, and 2)\nrequired test cost for achieving certain test objectives predicted with\nAutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) model.

The nuclear spectral functions are necessary for the description\nof high energy nuclear processes currently being studied at different labs such\nas JLAB, LHC and FNAL. The model followed the effective Feynman diagrammatic\napproach in order to account for the relativistic effects important in the SRC\ndomain. In addition to the two-nucleon (2N) SRC with center of mass motion\ncontribution, the contribution of the three-nucleon SRCs to the spectral\nfunctions was also derived. The latter was modeled based on the assumption that\nthe 3N SRCs are a product of two sequential short range nucleon-nucleon (NN)\ninteractions. The nuclear spectral functions models were derived from two\ntheoretical frameworks for evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first,\nreferred to as the virtual nucleon approximation, the Feynman diagrams were\nreduced to the time ordered non-covariant diagrams by evaluating the nucleon\nspectators in the SRC at their positive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the\ncontribution from vacuum diagrams. In the second approach, referred to as the\nlight-front approximation, the boost invariant nuclear spectral function was\nformulated in the light-front reference frame in which case the vacuum diagrams\nare kinematically suppressed and the bound nucleon is described by its\nlight-front variables such as momentum fraction, transverse momentum and\ninvariant mass. On the basis of the derived nuclear spectral functions, the\ncorresponding computational models were developed from which the numerical\nestimates of the SRC spectral functions, the SRC momentum distributions, and\nthe SRC density matrices were obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 23:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

An active distribution power\nsystem (DPS) having DERs reportedly can work as a reactive power prosumer to\nhelp balance the reactive power in the TPS. The reactive power potential (RPP)\nof a DPS, which is the range between the maximal inductive and capacitive\nreactive power the DPS can reliably provide, should be accurately estimated.\nHowever, an accurate estimation is difficult because of the network\nconstraints, mixed discrete and continuous variables, and the nonnegligible\nuncertainty in the DPS. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a robust RPP\nestimation method based on two-stage robust optimization, where the uncertainty\nin DERs and the boundary-bus voltage is considered. In this two-stage robust\nmodel, the RPP is pre-estimated in the first stage and its robust feasibility\nfor any possible instance of the uncertainty is checked via a tractable problem\nin the second stage. The column-and-constraint generation algorithm is adopted,\nwhich solves this model in finite iterations. Case studies show that this\nrobust method excels in yielding a completely reliable RPP, and also that a\nDPS, even under the uncertainty, is still an effective reactive power prosumer\nfor the TPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 00:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

In this work, we\npresent a deep adversarial learning methodology that overcomes the limitations\nof existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology, generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN) are trained to learn the mapping between latent variables and\nmicrostructures.

In the literature, there are two relevant groups of\napproaches: generating a trailer for a video or fast-forwarding while\nwatching/processing the video. The first group is supported by video\nsummarization techniques, which require processing of the entire video to\nselect an important subset for showing to users. In the second group, current\nfast-forwarding methods depend on either manual control or automatic adaptation\nof playback speed, which often do not present an accurate representation and\nmay still require processing of every frame.

It is an online\nframework that automatically fast-forwards a video and presents a\nrepresentative subset of frames to users on the fly. It does not require\nprocessing the entire video, but just the portion that is selected by the\nfast-forward agent, which makes the process very computationally efficient.

Thanks to the\nrecent advances in deep learning, several deep neural networks for medical\nimage segmentation have been introduced successfully for this purpose. In this\npaper, we focus on learning a deep multi-organ segmentation network that labels\nvoxels. In particular, we examine the critical choice of a loss function in\norder to handle the notorious imbalance problem that plagues both the input and\noutput of a learning model. The input imbalance refers to the class-imbalance\nin the input training samples (i.e., small foreground objects embedded in an\nabundance of background voxels, as well as organs of varying sizes). The output\nimbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positives and false\nnegatives of the inference model. In order to tackle both types of imbalance\nduring training and inference, we introduce a new curriculum learning based\nloss function. Specifically, we leverage Dice similarity coefficient to deter\nmodel parameters from being held at bad local minima and at the same time\ngradually learn better model parameters by penalizing for false\npositives/negatives using a cross entropy term.

We find that delayed submission of newly discovered NEA\ncandidate to the NEOCP drove a large fraction of the unconfirmed NEA\ncandidates. A high rate of motion was another significant contributing factor.\nWe suggest that prompt submission of suspected NEA discoveries and rapid\nresponse to fast moving targets and targets with fast growing ephemeris\nuncertainty would allow better coordination among dedicated follow-up\nobservers, decrease the number of unconfirmed NEA candidates, and increase the\ndiscovery rate of NEAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 02:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 05:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 14:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

In Web image search a different type of search result presentation is\nused than in general Web search, which leads to different interaction\nmechanisms and user behavior. For example, image search results are\nself-contained, so that users do not need to click the results to view the\nlanding page as in general Web search, which generates sparse click data. Also,\ntwo-dimensional result placement instead of a linear result list makes browsing\nbehaviors more complex. Thus, it is hard to apply standard user behavior models\n(e.g., click models) developed for general Web search to Web image search.\n  In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive image search user behavior analysis\nusing data from a lab-based user study as well as data from a commercial search\nlog. We then propose a novel interaction behavior model, called grid-based user\nbrowsing model (GUBM), whose design is motivated by observations from our data\nanalysis. GUBM can both capture users' interaction behavior, including cursor\nhovering, and alleviate position bias. The advantages of GUBM are two-fold: (1)\nIt is based on an unsupervised learning method and does not need manually\nannotated data for training. (2) It is based on user interaction features on\nsearch engine result pages (SERPs) and is easily transferable to other\nscenarios that have a grid-based interface such as video search engines. We\nconduct extensive experiments to test the performance of our model using a\nlarge-scale commercial image search log.

Retention errors, caused by charge leakage over time, are\nthe dominant source of flash memory errors. Understanding, characterizing, and\nreducing retention errors can significantly improve NAND flash memory\nreliability and endurance. In this work, we first characterize, with real 2Y-nm\nMLC NAND flash chips, how the threshold voltage distribution of flash memory\nchanges with different retention ages -- the length of time since a flash cell\nwas programmed. We observe from our characterization results that 1) the\noptimal read reference voltage of a flash cell, using which the data can be\nread with the lowest raw bit error rate (RBER), systematically changes with its\nretention age, and 2) different regions of flash memory can have different\nretention ages, and hence different optimal read reference voltages.\n  Based on our findings, we propose two new techniques. First, Retention\nOptimized Reading (ROR) adaptively learns and applies the optimal read\nreference voltage for each flash memory block online. The key idea of ROR is to\nperiodically learn a tight upper bound of the optimal read reference voltage,\nand from there approach the optimal read reference voltage. Our evaluations\nshow that ROR can extend flash memory lifetime by 64% and reduce average error\ncorrection latency by 10.1%.

Usually, we can estimate these subspaces by computing moments from\ndata. Often, there are many ways to estimate a subspace, by using moments of\ndifferent orders, transformed moments, etc. A natural question is: how can we\ncombine all these moment conditions and achieve optimality for subspace\nestimation?\n  In this paper, we formulate our problem as estimation of an unknown subspace\n$\\mathcal{S}$ of dimension $r$, given a set of overidentifying vectors $\\{\n\\mathrm{\\bf v}_\\ell \\}_{\\ell=1}^m$ (namely $m \\ge r$) that satisfy $\\mathbb{E}\n\\mathrm{\\bf v}_{\\ell} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and have the form $$ \\mathrm{\\bf v}_\\ell\n= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{\\bf f}_\\ell(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i), $$ where\ndata are i.i.d. and each function $\\mathrm{\\bf f}_\\ell$ is known.

Yet, the contact angle\ndependence is so large that the apparent line tension becomes always negative\nthough the intrinsic line tension without the correction is always positive.\nThese two examples demonstrate clear distinction between the theoretical\ncalculated intrinsic line tension and the experimentally determined apparent\nline tension which includes these two corrections. Naive comparison of the\nexperimentally determined and the theoretically calculated line tension is not\nalways possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 05:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Robotic cell injection systems provide the automation of the process as\nopposed to the manual and semi-automated cell injection systems, which require\nexpert operators and involve time consuming processes and also have lower\nsuccess rates. The automation of the cell injection process is achieved by\ncontrolling the injection force and planning the motion of the injection\npipette. Traditionally, these systems are analyzed using paper-and-pencil proof\nand computer simulation methods. However, the former is human-error prone and\nthe later is based on the numerical algorithms, where the approximation of the\nmathematical expressions introduces inaccuracies in the analysis. Formal\nmethods can overcome these limitations and thus provide an accurate analysis of\nthe cell injection systems.

Recent state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) based\naction recognition systems frequently involve 3D spatio-temporal ConvNet\nfilters, chunking videos into fixed length clips and Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM) networks. Such architectures are designed to take advantage of both\nshort term and long term temporal contexts, but also requires the accumulation\nof a predefined number of video frames (e.g., to construct video clips for 3D\nConvNet filters, to generate enough inputs for LSTMs). For applications that\nrequire low-latency online predictions of fast-changing action scenes, a new\naction recognition system is proposed in this paper. Termed \"Weighted\nMulti-Region Convolutional Neural Network\" (WMR ConvNet), the proposed system\nis LSTM-free, and is based on 2D ConvNet that does not require the accumulation\nof video frames for 3D ConvNet filtering. Unlike early 2D ConvNets that are\nbased purely on RGB frames and optical flow frames, the WMR ConvNet is designed\nto simultaneously capture multiple spatial and short term temporal cues (e.g.,\nhuman poses, occurrences of objects in the background) with both the primary\nregion (foreground) and secondary regions (mostly background). On both the\nUCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, the proposed WMR ConvNet achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance among competing low-latency algorithms.\nFurthermore, WMR ConvNet even outperforms the 3D ConvNet based C3D algorithm\nthat requires video frame accumulation. In an ablation study with the optical\nflow ConvNet stream removed, the ablated WMR ConvNet nevertheless outperforms\ncompeting algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 07:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

We evaluate the proposed model in two different languages.\nExperiments show that the adversarial multi-task neural metric achieves a high\ncorrelation with human annotation, which yields better performance than\nmonolingual ones and various existing metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 09:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

Protoplanetary disks show large diversity regarding their morphology\nand dust composition. With mid-infrared interferometry the thermal emission of\ndisks can be spatially resolved, and the distribution and properties of the\ndust within can be studied. Aims. Our aim is to perform a statistical analysis\non a large sample of 82 disks around low- and intermediate-mass young stars,\nbased on mid-infrared interferometric observations. We intend to study the\ndistribution of disk sizes, variability, and the silicate dust mineralogy.\nMethods. Archival mid-infrared interferometric data from the MIDI instrument on\nthe VLTI are homogeneously reduced and calibrated. Geometric disk models are\nused to fit the observations to get spatial information about the disks. An\nautomatic spectral decomposition pipeline is applied to analyze the shape of\nthe silicate feature. Results. We present the resulting data products in the\nform of an atlas, containing N band correlated and total spectra, visibilities,\nand differential phases. The majority of our data can be well fitted with a\ncontinuous disk model, except for a few objects, where a gapped model gives a\nbetter match. From the mid-infrared size--luminosity relation we find that\ndisks around T Tauri stars are generally colder and more extended with respect\nto the stellar luminosity than disks around Herbig Ae stars. We find that in\nthe innermost part of the disks ($r \\lesssim 1$~au) the silicate feature is\ngenerally weaker than in the outer parts, suggesting that in the inner parts\nthe dust is substantially more processed. We analyze stellar multiplicity and\nfind that in two systems (AB Aur and HD 72106) data suggest a new companion or\nasymmetric inner disk structure. We make predictions for the observability of\nour objects with the upcoming MATISSE instrument, supporting the practical\npreparations of future MATISSE observations of T Tauri stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 10:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Such flows are important across a\nrange of applications, including jet pumps, combustion chambers and aerospace\nengineering. Previous studies show that swirl can increase shear layer growth\nrates and, in the case of confining walls, reduce flow separation. However, the\neffect of swirl on pressure loss in a confined flow is uncertain. To address\nthis, we develop a simplified model that approximates the axial flow profile as\na linear shear layer separating uniform-velocity core and annular streams. The\nazimuthal flow profile is approximated as a solid body rotation within the core\nregion, and a parabolic mixing profile within the shear layer. This model shows\ngood agreement with computational turbulence modelling, whilst its simplicity\nand low computational cost make it ideal for benchmark predictions and design\npurposes. Using this model, we confirm that a swirling core is useful for\nincreasing shear layer growth rates, but find that it is detrimental to\npressure recovery. This has important implications for the design of diffusers\nthat incorporate swirling flows. We use the model to describe the slow\nrecirculation region that can form along the pipe axis for sufficiently large\nswirl, by approximating it as a stagnant zone with zero velocity.

By properly pricing the geographically\ndistributed ENs, the proposed framework generates a market equilibrium (ME)\nsolution that not only maximizes the edge computing resource utilization but\nalso allocates optimal (i.e., utility-maximizing) resource bundles to the\nservices given their budget constraints. When the utility of a service is\ndefined as the maximum revenue that the service can achieve from its resource\nallotment, the equilibrium can be computed centrally by solving the\nEisenberg-Gale (EG) convex program. drawn from the economics literature.

A more efficient learning strategy is required for\nimproving the performance of peptide identification on challenging datasets.\n  Results: In this work, we present an online learning method to conquer the\nchallenges remained for exiting peptide identification algorithms. We propose a\ncost-sensitive learning model by using different loss functions for decoy and\ntarget PSMs respectively. A larger penalty for wrongly selecting decoy PSMs\nthan that for target PSMs, and thus the new model can reduce its false\ndiscovery rate on hard datasets.

Up till now, the dynamic contribution induced by optical\nelements has been clearly recognized. However, the contribution of geometric\nphase still seems obscure, especially considering the vector vortex beams. In\nthis work, an analytical formula is derived to fully describe the OAM variation\nintroduced by the nonabsorbing optical elements, which perform space-variant\npolarization-state manipulations. It is found that the geometric contribution\ncan be further divided into two parts: one is directly related to optical\nelements and the other one explicitly relies solely on the vortices before and\nafter the transformations.

In this method, we reformulate the MFS$_C$ problem as an $\\ell_0$\noptimization problem and construct a sequence of continuous optimization\nproblems to approximate it. The objective of each approximation problem is the\nsum of the composition of a nonnegative nondecreasing continuously\ndifferentiable concave function with the squared distance function to a closed\nset. Although this objective function is nonsmooth in general, a subgradient\ncan be obtained in terms of the projections onto the closed sets. Based on this\nobservation, we adapt a subgradient projection method to solve these\napproximation problems. Unlike classical subgradient methods, the convergence\n(clustering to stationary points) of our subgradient method is guaranteed with\na {\\em nondiminishing stepsize} under mild assumptions. This allows us to\nfurther study the sequential convergence of the subgradient method under\nsuitable Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz assumptions. Finally, we illustrate our\nalgorithm numerically for solving the MFS$_C$ problems on a collection of\nhalfspaces and a collection of unions of halfspaces, respectively, with respect\nto the set of $s$-sparse vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 14:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

On an undirected graph with\n$n$ nodes and $m$ edges, $O(\\log n)$ round connectivity algorithms have been\nknown for over 35 years. However, no algorithms with better complexity bounds\nwere known. In this work, we give fully scalable, faster algorithms for the\nconnectivity problem, by parameterizing the time complexity as a function of\nthe diameter of the graph. Our main result is a $O(\\log D \\log\\log_{m/n} n)$\ntime connectivity algorithm for diameter-$D$ graphs, using $\\Theta(m)$ total\nmemory. If our algorithm can use more memory, it can terminate in fewer rounds,\nand there is no lower bound on the memory per processor.\n  We extend our results to related graph problems such as spanning forest,\nfinding a DFS sequence, exact/approximate minimum spanning forest, and\nbottleneck spanning forest. We also show that achieving similar bounds for\nreachability in directed graphs would imply faster boolean matrix\nmultiplication algorithms.\n  We introduce several new algorithmic ideas. We describe a general technique\ncalled double exponential speed problem size reduction which roughly means that\nif we can use total memory $N$ to reduce a problem from size $n$ to $n/k$, for\n$k=(N/n)^{\\Theta(1)}$ in one phase, then we can solve the problem in\n$O(\\log\\log_{N/n} n)$ phases. In order to achieve this fast reduction for graph\nconnectivity, we use a multistep algorithm. One key step is a carefully\nconstructed truncated broadcasting scheme where each node broadcasts neighbor\nsets to its neighbors in a way that limits the size of the resulting neighbor\nsets. Another key step is random leader contraction, where we choose a smaller\nset of leaders than many previous works do.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 14:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

A commonly overlooked challenge in such function fitting procedures\nis that fluctuations around mean values, by construction, exhibit temporal\ncorrelations.

We hereby\naddress the above issues by exploring the synergistic effect of\n2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4- benzoquinone and H2O on the oxygen chemistry in a\nnon-aqueous Li-O2 battery. Water stabilizes the quinone monoanion and dianion,\nshifting the reduction potentials of the quinone and monoanion to more positive\nvalues (vs. Li+). When water and the quinone are used together in a (largely)\nnon-aqueous Li-O2 battery, the cell discharge operates via a two-electron\noxygen reduction reaction to form Li2O2, the battery discharge voltage, rate,\ncapacity all being considerably increased and fewer side reactions being\ndetected; Li2O2 crystals can grow up to 30 um, more than an order of magnitude\nlarger than cases with the quinone alone or without any additives, suggesting\nthat water is essential to promoting a solution dominated process with the\nquinone on discharging. The catalytic reduction of O2 by the quinone monoanion\nis predominantly responsible for the attractive features mentioned above. Water\nstabilizes the quinone monoanion via hydrogen bond formation and by\ncoordination of the Li+ ions, and it also helps increase the solvation,\nconcentration, life time and diffusion length of reduced oxygen species that\ndictate the discharge voltage, rate and capacity of the battery.

The agent has an incentive\nto try to deceive the adversary about its intentions, while at the same time\nworking to achieve its objective. The primary contribution of this paper is to\nintroduce a mathematically rigorous framework for the notion of deception\nwithin the context of optimal control. The central notion introduced in the\npaper is that of a belief-induced reward: a reward dependent not only on the\nagent's state and action, but also adversary's beliefs. Design of an optimal\ndeceptive strategy then becomes a question of optimal control design on the\nproduct of the agent's state space and the adversary's belief space. The\nproposed framework allows for deception to be defined in an arbitrary control\nsystem endowed with a reward function, as well as with additional\nspecifications limiting the agent's control policy. In addition to defining\ndeception, we discuss design of optimally deceptive strategies under\nuncertainties in agent's knowledge about the adversary's learning process. In\nthe latter part of the paper, we focus on a setting where the agent's behavior\nis governed by a Markov decision process, and show that the design of optimally\ndeceptive strategies under lack of knowledge about the adversary naturally\nreduces to previously discussed problems in control design on partially\nobservable or uncertain Markov decision processes. Finally, we present two\nexamples of deceptive strategies: a \"cops and robbers\" scenario and an example\nwhere an agent may use camouflage while moving. We show that optimally\ndeceptive strategies in such examples follow the intuitive idea of how to\ndeceive an adversary in the above settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 15:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

This application is particularly\nuseful when one is concerned with the field locally around special points\n(e.g.~maxima or minima), as we exemplify by the problem of cosmic `manyfield'\ninflation in the early universe. Second, we show that this method has\napplications in machine learning, and greatly simplifies the regression problem\nof determining the hyperparameters of the covariance function given a training\ndata set consisting of local Taylor coefficients at single point.

Indeed, the predicted\nbirefringence of vacuum is $\\Delta n = 4.0\\times 10^{-24}$ @ 1~T. One of the\nkey ingredients when designing a polarimeter capable of detecting such a small\nbirefringence is a long optical path length within the magnetic field and a\ntime dependent effect. To lengthen the optical path within the magnetic field a\nFabry-Perot optical cavity is generally used with a finesse ranging from ${\\cal\nF} \\approx 10^4$ to ${\\cal F} \\approx7\\times 10^5$. Interestingly, there is a\ndifficulty in reaching the predicted shot noise limit of such polarimeters. We\nhave measured the ellipticity and rotation noises along with a Cotton-Mouton\nand a Faraday effect as a function of the finesse of the cavity of the PVLAS\npolarimeter. The observations are consistent with the idea that the cavity\nmirrors generate a birefringence-dominated noise whose ellipticity is amplified\nby the cavity itself.

However,\nwhen applied to a MANET, several problematics arise mainly due to the absence\nof a centralized administration, the inherent MANETs constraints and the nodes\nmobility. In this paper, we present a hybrid distributed monitoring\narchitecture for mobile adhoc networks in context of mobility pattern. We get\ninspired of gossip-based and hierarchical-based algorithms for query\ndissemination and data aggregation. We define gossip-based mechanisms that help\nour virtual hierarchical topology to complete the data aggregation, and then\nensure the stability and robustness of our approach in dynamic environments.\nFurther, we propose a fully distributed monitoring protocol that ease the nodes\ncommunications. We evaluate our approach through a simulated testbed by using\nNS3 and Docker, and illustrate the efficiency of our mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 19:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

In this work we assess the robustness of such\napproach with respect to errors in the training stage, and propose an extension\nthat alleviates such problems. We introduce robustness in the process by\nincorporating a combination of radial basis kernel functions and stochastic\ndistances with Support Vector Machines (SVM). We consider several stochastic\ndistances between Wishart: Bhatacharyya, Kullback-Leibler, Chi-Square,\nR\\'{e}nyi, and Hellinger. We perform two case studies with PolSAR images, both\nsimulated and from actual sensors, and different classification scenarios to\ncompare the performance of Minimum Distance and SVM classification frameworks.\nWith this, we model the situation of imperfect training samples. We show that\nSVM with the proposed kernel functions achieves better performance with respect\nto Minimum Distance, at the expense of more computational resources and the\nneed of parameter tuning.

In domains like materials discovery, due to the\nflaws and biases in raw experimental data, the identification of X-ray\ndiffraction patterns (XRD) often requires a huge amount of manual work in\nfinding refined phases that are similar to the ideal theoretical ones.\nAutomatically refining the raw XRDs utilizing the simulated theoretical data is\nthus desirable. We propose imitation refinement, a novel approach to refine\nimperfect input patterns, guided by a pre-trained classifier incorporating\nprior knowledge from simulated theoretical data, such that the refined patterns\nimitate the ideal data. The classifier is trained on the ideal simulated data\nto classify patterns and learns an embedding space where each class is\nrepresented by a prototype. The refiner learns to refine the imperfect patterns\nwith small modifications, such that their embeddings are closer to the\ncorresponding prototypes. We show that the refiner can be trained in both\nsupervised and unsupervised fashions. We further illustrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach both qualitatively and quantitatively in a digit\nrefinement task and an X-ray diffraction pattern refinement task in materials\ndiscovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 22:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 16:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

In this work, we present an attention\nbased deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal AF episodes from a\nsequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording\nwindows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep\nconvolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then\npresented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer\nfor AF detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework\nfor transient AF detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the\nUniversity of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an AUC of 0.94 on\nthe testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also\ndemonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the\nlearned model parameters from one recording modality (ECG) to another\n(photoplethysmogram) with improved AF detection performance. The proposed high\naccuracy, low false alarm algorithm for detecting paroxysmal AF has potential\napplications in long-term monitoring using wearable sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2018 20:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

A key aspect of this method is that it operates on a space of\nvector-valued observables using a kernel measure of similarity that takes into\naccount both temporal and spatial degrees of freedom (in contrast, classical\nkernel techniques such as PCA utilize aggregate measures of similarity between\n'snapshots'). As a result, spectral decomposition of data via our approach\nyields a significantly more efficient and physically meaningful representation\nof complex spatiotemporal signals than conventional methods based on\nscalar-valued kernels.
