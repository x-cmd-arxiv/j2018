When dealing with unrealizable\nspecifications, finding the weakest environment assumptions that would ensure\nrealizability is typically a desirable property; in such context the weakness\nof the assumptions is a major quality parameter. The question of whether one\nassumption is weaker than another is commonly interpreted using implication or,\nequivalently, language inclusion.

They are both characterized by an equally spaced energy\nspectrum (Picket Fence) where all the levels are coupled between each other by\na constant coupling which is real for the BCS model and purely imaginary for\nthe SES model. While the former corresponds to the discrete BCS-model\ndescribing the coupling of Cooper pairs in momentum space and it induces a\nSuperconductive regime, the latter describes the coupling of single particle\nenergy levels to a common decay channel and it induces a Superradiant\ntransition. We show that the transition to a Superradiant regime can be\nconnected to the emergence of an imaginary energy gap, similarly to the\ntransition to a Superconductive regime where a real energy gap emerges. Despite\ntheir different physical origin, it is possible to show that both the\nSuperradiant and the Superconducting gaps have the same magnitude in the large\ngap limit.

We\npreviously proposed systems based on Weightless Neural Networks (WNN) to\naddress this problem as a classification task.

In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem as follows. Firstly,\ngiven a live image, the place recognition system returns the most similar image\nand its pose. Then, given live and recollected images, a visual localization\nsystem outputs the relative camera pose represented by those images. To\nestimate the relative camera pose between the recollected and the current\nimages, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with the two images as\ninput and a relative pose vector as output. Together, these systems solve the\nglobal localization problem using the topological and metric information to\napproximate the current vehicle pose. The full approach is compared to a Real-\nTime Kinematic GPS system and a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\nsystem.

Contemporary systems perform bulk data movement movement\ninefficiently, by transferring data from DRAM to the processor, and then back\nto DRAM, across a narrow off-chip channel. The use of this narrow channel\nresults in high latency and energy consumption. Prior work proposes to avoid\nthese high costs by exploiting the existing wide internal DRAM bandwidth for\nbulk data movement, but the limited connectivity of wires within DRAM allows\nfast data movement within only a single DRAM subarray. Each subarray is only a\nfew megabytes in size, greatly restricting the range over which fast bulk data\nmovement can happen within DRAM.\n  Our HPCA 2016 paper proposes a new DRAM substrate, Low-Cost Inter-Linked\nSubarrays (LISA), whose goal is to enable fast and efficient data movement\nacross a large range of memory at low cost. LISA adds low-cost connections\nbetween adjacent subarrays. By using these connections to interconnect the\nexisting internal wires (bitlines) of adjacent subarrays, LISA enables\nwide-bandwidth data transfer across multiple subarrays with little (only 0.8%)\nDRAM area overhead. As a DRAM substrate, LISA is versatile, enabling a variety\nof new applications.

SoftMC is an FPGA-based\ntesting platform that can control and test memory modules designed for the\ncommonly-used DDR (Double Data Rate) interface. SoftMC has two key properties:\n(i) it provides flexibility to thoroughly control memory behavior or to\nimplement a wide range of mechanisms using DDR commands; and (ii) it is easy to\nuse as it provides a simple and intuitive high-level programming interface for\nusers, completely hiding the low-level details of the FPGA.\n  We demonstrate the capability, flexibility, and programming ease of SoftMC\nwith two example use cases.

We have studied the orbital and spin evolution of\nbinary BHs in triple systems, where the tertiary companion excites large\neccentricity in the inner binary through Lidov-Kozai oscillations, causing the\nbinary to merge via gravitational radiation. Using the single-orbital-averaged\nand double-orbital-averaged secular dynamics equations of triples, we determine\nthe merger window (the range of companion inclinations that allows the inner\nbinary to merge) and the merger fraction as a function of various system\nparameters. For typical BH binaries, the merger fraction increases rapidly with\nthe perturber eccentricity $e_{\\rm out}$ because of the octupole perturbation,\nreaching $10-20\\%$ at $e_{\\rm out}=0.9$. We derive the analytical expressions\nfor the merger window and merger fraction for systems with negligible octupole\neffect, and apply them to neutron star binary mergers in triples. We also\nfollow the spin evolution of the BHs during the companion-induced orbital\ndecay. Starting from aligned spin axes, a wide range of final spin-orbit\nmisalignment angle $\\theta_{\\rm sl}^{\\rm f}$ can be generated when the binary\nenters the LIGO band. For systems where the octupole effect is small (such as\nequal mass binaries or $e_{\\rm out}\\sim 0$), the distribution of $\\theta_{\\rm\nsl}^{\\rm f}$ peaks around $90^\\circ$. As the octuple effect increases, a more\nisotropic distribution of final spin axis is produced.

Observations show\nthat many binaries that have undergone AGB mass transfer have orbital periods\nof 1-10 yr, at odds with the predictions of binary population synthesis models.\nWe investigate the mass-accretion efficiency and angular-momentum loss via wind\nmass transfer in AGB binary systems. We use these quantities to predict the\nevolution of the orbit. We perform 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the stellar\nwind lost by an AGB star using the AMUSE framework. We approximate the thermal\nevolution of the gas by imposing a simple effective cooling balance and we vary\nthe orbital separation and the velocity of the stellar wind. We find that for\nwind velocities $v_{\\infty}$ larger than the relative orbital velocity of the\nsystem $v_\\mathrm{orb}$ the flow is described by the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton\napproximation and the angular-momentum loss is modest, leading to an expansion\nof the orbit. For low wind velocities an accretion disk is formed around the\ncompanion and the accretion efficiency as well as the angular-momentum loss are\nenhanced, implying that the orbit will shrink. We find that the transfer of\nangular momentum from the orbit to the outflowing gas occurs within a few\norbital separations from the center of mass of the binary. Our results suggest\nthat the orbital evolution of AGB binaries can be predicted as a function of\nthe ratio $v_{\\infty}/v_\\mathrm{orb}$. Our results can provide insight into the\npuzzling orbital periods of post-AGB binaries and suggest that the number of\nstars entering into the common-envelope phase will increase. The latter can\nhave significant implications for the expected formation rates of the end\nproducts of low-mass binary evolution, such as cataclysmic binaries, type Ia\nsupernova and double white-dwarf mergers.

ALMA observations in Band 6 at 234 GHz and Band 7 at 328\nGHz at 0.3\" resolution toward the K6 star V1094 Sco in Lupus III are presented,\nand its disk structure is analyzed. The spectral index $\\alpha_{mm}$ is\ndetermined in the inner 150 AU of the disk. The ALMA continuum data show a very\nextended disk with two gap/ring pairs. The gaps are located at 100 AU and 170\nAU, the bright rings at 130 AU and 220 AU. Continuum emission is detected out\nto a 300 AU distance, similar to IM Lup but a factor of 5 larger than typically\nfound for Lupus disks at this sensitivity and resolution. The bright central\nregion of the disk (within 35 AU) is possibly optically thick at 1 mm\nwavelengths, and has a brightness temperature of only 13 K. The spectral index\nincreases between the inner disk and the first ring, at the location of the\nfirst gap. Due to the low temperature of the disk midplane, snow lines can be\nexcluded as the drivers behind the ring and gap formation in this disk. Disks\nthe size of V1094 Sco are rare, and only 2.1+-1.5% of disks in Lupus show\ncontinuum emission beyond 200 AU. Possible connections between the large\nprimordial disk population, transition disks, and exoplanets are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 18:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Since 3D pose is a continuous quantity, a\nnatural formulation for this task is to solve a pose regression problem.\nHowever, since pose regression methods return a single estimate of the pose,\nthey have difficulties handling multimodal pose distributions (e.g. in the case\nof symmetric objects). An alternative formulation, which can capture multimodal\npose distributions, is to discretize the pose space into bins and solve a pose\nclassification problem. However, pose classification methods can give large\npose estimation errors depending on the coarseness of the discretization. In\nthis paper, we propose a mixed classification-regression framework that uses a\nclassification network to produce a discrete multimodal pose estimate and a\nregression network to produce a continuous refinement of the discrete estimate.\nThe proposed framework can accommodate different architectures and loss\nfunctions, leading to multiple classification-regression models, some of which\nachieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Pascal3D+ dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 18:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

This was first shown in 2004 for jumps of\ntracer atoms that lead to reorientation of the local electric field-gradient,\nsuch as jumps on the connected a-sublattice in the L12 crystal structure.\nStudies on many such phases using the 111In/Cd PAC probe are reviewed in this\npaper. A major finding from a 2009 study of indides of rare-earth elements,\nIn3R, was the apparent observation of two diffusional regimes: one dominant for\nheavy-lanthanide phases, R= Lu, Tm, Er, Dy, Tb, Gd, that was consistent with a\nsimple model of vacancy diffusion on the In a-sublattice, and another for\nlight-lanthanides, R= La, Ce, Pr, Nd, that had no obvious explanation but for\nwhich several alternative diffusion mechanisms were suggested. It is herein\nproposed that the latter regime arises not from a diffusion mechanism but from\ntransfer of Cd-probes from In-sites where they originate to R-sites as a\nconsequence of a change in site-preference of 111Cd-daughter atoms from\nIn-sites to R-sites following transmutation of 111In. Support for this transfer\nmechanism comes from a study of site-preferences and jump-frequencies of\n111In/Cd probes in Pd3R phases. Possible mechanisms for transfer are described,\nwith the most likely mechanism identified as one in which Cd-probes on a-sites\ntransfer to interstitial sites, diffuse interstitially, and then react with\nvacancies on b-sites. Implications of this proposal are discussed. For indides\nof heavy-lanthanide elements, the Cd-tracer remains on the In-sublattice and\nrelaxation gives the diffusional jump-frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 20:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

Approaches to\nresolve this ambiguity and correct position errors are generally known as radar\nautofocus. Common techniques that attempt to resolve the antenna ambiguity\ngenerally assume an unknown gain and phase error afflicting the radar\nmeasurements. However, ensuring identifiability and tractability of the unknown\nerror imposes strict restrictions on the allowable antenna perturbations.\nFurthermore, these techniques are often not applicable in near-field imaging,\nwhere mapping the position ambiguity to phase errors breaks down.\n  In this paper, we propose an alternate formulation where the position error\nof each antenna is mapped to a spatial shift operator in the image-domain.\nThus, the radar autofocus problem becomes a multichannel blind deconvolution\nproblem, in which the radar measurements correspond to observations of a static\nradar image that is convolved with the spatial shift kernel associated with\neach antenna. To solve the reformulated problem, we also develop a block\ncoordinate descent framework that leverages the sparsity and piece-wise\nsmoothness of the radar scene, as well as the one-sparse property of the two\ndimensional shift kernels.

The early steps of membrane fusion and viral capsid entry are\nmediated by adsorption to the cell surface, and receptor and coreceptor\nbinding. HIV-1 specifically targets CD4+ helper T-cells of the human immune\nsystem and binds to the receptor CD4 and coreceptor CCR5 before fusion is\ninitiated. Previous experiments have been performed using a cell line\n(293-Affinofile) in which the expression of CD4 and CCR5 concentration were\nindependently controlled. After exposure to HIV-1 of various strains, the\nresulting infectivity was measured through the fraction of infected cells. To\ndesign and evaluate the effectiveness of drug therapies that target the\ninhibition of the entry processes, an accurate functional relationship between\nthe CD4/CCR5 concentrations and infectivity is desired in order to more\nquantitatively analyze experimental data. We propose three kinetic models\ndescribing the possible mechanistic processes involved in HIV entry and fit\ntheir predictions to infectivity measurements, contrasting and comparing\ndifferent outcomes. Our approach allows interpretation of the clustering of\ninfectivity of different strains of HIV-1 in the space of mechanistic kinetic\nparameters. Our model fitting also allows inference of nontrivial\nstoichiometries of receptor and coreceptor binding and provides a framework\nthrough which to quantitatively investigate the effectiveness of fusion\ninhibitors and neutralizing antibodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 20:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

In this study we use 1D nonlinear\nMHD simulations to validate the predicted results from the linear theory and\ninvestigate the standing slow-mode wave excitation mechanism. We first explore\nthe wave trigger based on the magnetic field extrapolation and flare emission\nfeatures. Using a flow pulse driven at one footpoint we simulate the wave\nexcitation in two types of loop models: model 1 with the classical transport\ncoefficients and model 2 with the seismology-determined transport coefficients.\nWe find that model 2 can form the standing wave pattern (within about one\nperiod) from initial propagating disturbances much faster than model 1, in\nbetter agreement with the observations. Simulations of the harmonic waves and\nthe Fourier decomposition analysis show that the scaling law between damping\ntime ($\\tau$) and wave period ($P$) follows $\\tau\\propto{P^2}$ in model 2,\nwhile $\\tau\\propto{P}$ in model 1. This indicates that the largely enhanced\nviscosity efficiently increases the dissipation of higher harmonic components,\nfavoring the quick formation of the fundamental standing mode. Our study\nsuggests that observational constraints on the transport coefficients are\nimportant in understanding both, the wave excitation and damping mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 20:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

NAND flash memory reliability continues to degrade as the\nmemory is scaled down and more bits are programmed per cell. A key contributor\nto this reduced reliability is read disturb, where a read to one row of cells\nimpacts the threshold voltages of unread flash cells in different rows of the\nsame block.\n  For the first time in open literature, this work experimentally characterizes\nread disturb errors on state-of-the-art 2Y-nm (i.e., 20-24 nm) MLC NAND flash\nmemory chips. Our findings (1) correlate the magnitude of threshold voltage\nshifts with read operation counts, (2) demonstrate how program/erase cycle\ncount and retention age affect the read-disturb-induced error rate, and (3)\nidentify that lowering pass-through voltage levels reduces the impact of read\ndisturb and extend flash lifetime. Particularly, we find that the probability\nof read disturb errors increases with both higher wear-out and higher\npass-through voltage levels.\n  We leverage these findings to develop two new techniques. The first technique\nmitigates read disturb errors by dynamically tuning the pass-through voltage on\na per-block basis. Using real workload traces, our evaluations show that this\ntechnique increases flash memory endurance by an average of 21%. The second\ntechnique recovers from previously-uncorrectable flash errors by identifying\nand probabilistically correcting cells susceptible to read disturb errors. Our\nevaluations show that this recovery technique reduces the raw bit error rate by\n36%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2018 21:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

As MLC NAND flash memory scaled down to smaller manufacturing\nprocess technologies, manufacturers adopted a two-step programming method to\nimprove reliability.

For the rest,\nreliable DR2 distances differ significantly from values in the literature, and\nin most cases the Gaia DR2 distance is smaller. Two key results are that the S\nDoradus instability strip may not be as clearly defined as previously thought,\nand that there exists a population of LBVs at relatively low luminosities. LBVs\nseem to occupy a wide swath from the end of the main sequence at the blue edge\nto 8000 K at the red side, with a spread in luminosity reaching as low as\nlog(L/Lsun)=4.5. The lower-luminosity group corresponds to effective\nsingle-star initial masses of 10-25 Msun, and includes objects that have been\nconsidered as confirmed LBVs.

As part of a project to search for hot binary companions to\ncool AGB stars using the GALEX archive, we discovered a late-M star, Y Gem, to\nbe a source of strong and variable UV and X-ray emission. Here we report UV\nspectroscopic observations of Y Gem obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope\nthat show strong flickering in the UV continuum on time-scales of <~20 s,\ncharacteristic of an active accretion disk. Several UV lines with P-Cygni-type\nprofiles from species such as Si IV and C IV are also observed, with emission\nand absorption features that are red- and blue- shifted by velocities of ~500\nkm/s from the systemic velocity. Our model for these (and previous)\nobservations is that material from the primary star is gravitationally captured\nby a companion, producing a hot accretion disk. The latter powers a fast\noutflow that produces blue-shifted features due to absorption of UV continuum\nemitted by the disk, whereas the red-shifted emission features arise in heated\ninfalling material from the primary. The outflow velocities support a previous\ninference by Sahai et al. (2015) that Y Gem's companion is a low-mass\nmain-sequence star.

Each update of the particle cloud consists of three steps:\nreweighting, resampling, and moving. In the move step, each particle is moved\nusing a Markov kernel; this is typically the most computationally expensive\npart, particularly when the dataset is large. It is crucial to have an\nefficient move step to ensure particle diversity. Our article makes two\nimportant contributions. First, in order to speed up the SMC computation, we\nuse an approximately unbiased and efficient annealed likelihood estimator based\non data subsampling. The subsampling approach is more memory efficient than the\ncorresponding full data SMC, which is an advantage for parallel computation.\nSecond, we use a Metropolis within Gibbs kernel with two conditional updates.

A typical example is the social network, where the behaviour of every\nuser is depicted by a transaction database that stores his daily posted\ncontents. A transaction database is a set of transactions, where a transaction\nis a set of items. Every path of the network is a sequence of vertices that\ninduces multiple sequences of transactions. The sequences of transactions\ninduced by all of the paths in the network forms an extremely large sequence\ndatabase. Finding frequent sequential patterns from such sequence database\ndiscovers interesting subsequences that frequently appear in many paths of the\nnetwork. However, it is a challenging task, since the sequence database induced\nby a database graph is too large to be explicitly induced and stored. In this\npaper, we propose the novel notion of database graph, which naturally models a\nwide spectrum of real world networks by associating each vertex with a\ntransaction database. Our goal is to find the top-k frequent sequential\npatterns in the sequence database induced from a database graph. We prove that\nthis problem is #P-hard.

To construct CuDvine, we first build a semiparametric\nunivariate D-vine time series model (uDvine) based on a D-vine. The uDvine\ngeneralizes the existing first-order copula-based Markov chain models to Markov\nchains of an arbitrary-order. Building upon uDvine, we construct CuDvine by\nlinking multiple uDvines via a parametric copula. As a simple and tractable\nmodel, CuDvine provides flexible models for marginal behavior and temporal\ndependence of time series, and can also incorporate sophisticated\ncross-sectional dependence such as time-varying and spatio-temporal dependence\nfor high-dimensional applications. Robust and computationally efficient\nprocedures, including a sequential model selection method and a two-stage MLE,\nare proposed for model estimation and inference, and their statistical\nproperties are investigated. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate\nthe flexibility of CuDvine, and to examine the performance of the sequential\nmodel selection procedure and the two-stage MLE.

State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms - especially\ncollaborative filtering (CF)-based approaches with shallow or deep models -\nusually work with various unstructured information sources for recommendation,\nsuch as textual reviews, visual images, and various implicit or explicit\nfeedbacks. Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based\napproaches, they have been largely ignored recently due to the research focus\non CF approaches. However, structured knowledge exhibit unique advantages in\npersonalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge about users\nand items is considered for recommendation, the system could provide highly\ncustomized recommendations based on users' historical behaviors and the\nknowledge is helpful for providing informed explanations regarding the\nrecommended items. A great challenge for using knowledge bases for\nrecommendation is how to integrate large-scale structured data, while taking\nadvantage of collaborative filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent\nachievements in knowledge-base embedding (KBE) sheds light on this problem,\nwhich makes it possible to learn user and item representations while preserving\nthe structure of their relationship with external knowledge for explanation. In\nthis work, we propose to explain knowledge-base embeddings for explainable\nrecommendation.

Because of the\nexistence of different ways for dimension reduction, we construct two\nestimators that may improve the estimator without using $Z$.

Finding an MIS is a fundamental problem in\ndistributed computing. Although the problem is extensively studied and well\nunderstood in simple graphs, our knowledge is still quite limited when solving\nit in hypergraphs, especially in the distributed CONGEST model. In this paper,\nwe focus on linear hypergraphs---a class of hypergraphs in which any two\nhyperedges overlap on at most one node.\n  We first present a randomized algorithm for computing an MIS in linear\nhypergraphs. It has poly-logarithmic runtime and it works in the CONGEST model.\nThe algorithm uses a network decomposition to achieve fast parallel processing.\nWithin each cluster of the decomposition, we run a distributed variant of a\nparallel hypergraph MIS algorithm by Luczak and Szymanska.\n  We then propose the concept of a generalized maximal independent set (GMIS)\nas an extension to the classical MIS in hypergraphs. More specifically, in a\nGMIS, for each hyperedge $e$ in a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}$, we associate an\ninteger threshold $t_e$ in the range $[1, |e|-1]$, and the goal is to find a\nmaximal subset $\\mathcal{I}$ of vertices that do not violate any threshold\nconstraints: $\\forall e \\in E(\\mathcal{H}), |e \\cap \\mathcal{I}| \\leq t_e$. We\nhope that GMIS might capture a broader class of real-world problems than MIS;\nwe also believe that GMIS is an interesting and challenging symmetry breaking\nproblem on its own.\n  Our second upper bound result is a distributed algorithm for computing a GMIS\nin linear hypergraphs, subject to the constraint that the maximum hyperedge\nsize is bounded by some constant. Again, the algorithm has poly-logarithmic\nruntime and it works in the CONGEST model. It is obtained by generalizing our\nprevious (linear) hypergraph MIS algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 03:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

By\nperforming numerical simulations, Yuan et al. studied the detailed properties\nof wind generated from weakly magnetized accretion flow.

In this paper, we study the properties of wind generated from both\nweakly and strongly magnetized accretion flow. We focus on how the magnetic\nfield strength affects the wind properties. We solve time-steady\ntwo-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations of black hole accretion in\nthe presence of large-scale magnetic field. We assume self-similarity in radial\ndirection. The magnetic field is assumed to be evenly symmetric with the\nequatorial plane. We find that wind exists in both weakly and strongly\nmagnetized accretion flow. When magnetic field is weak (magnetic pressure is\nmore than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than gas pressure), wind is driven by\ngas pressure gradient and centrifugal forces. When magnetic field is strong\n(magnetic pressure is slightly smaller than gas pressure), wind is driven by\ngas pressure gradient and magnetic pressure gradient forces. The power of wind\nin strongly magnetized case is just slightly larger than that in weakly\nmagnetized case.

The thermally-driven turbulent convection\nin water is a typical example. In such a case the smallest scale in the problem\nis the Batchelor scale $l_b$, rather than the Kolmogorov scale $l_k$, as $l_b =\nl_k/Sc^{1/2}$, where Sc is the Schmidt number (or Prandtl number in the case of\ntemperature). In the numerical studies of such scalar turbulence, the\nconventional approach is to use a single grid for both the velocity and scalar\nfields. Such single-resolution scheme often over-resolves the velocity field\nbecause the resolution requirement for scalar is higher than that for the\nvelocity field, since $l_b<l_k$ for $Sc>1$. In this paper we put forward an\nalgorithm that implements the so-called multiple-resolution method with a\nfinite-volume code. In this scheme, the velocity and pressure fields are solved\nin a coarse grid, while the scalar field is solved in a dense grid. The central\nidea is to implement the interpolation scheme on the framework of finite-volume\nto reconstruct the divergence-free velocity from the coarse to the dense grid.\nWe demonstrate our method using a canonical model system of fluid turbulence,\nthe Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection.

The resulting\nproblem is reduced to the equivalent one for the component of three quarks and\nno gluons. Each of the three quark-quark interaction terms thus obtained\nconsists of a spin-dependent Coulomb term and a spin-independent harmonic\noscillator term. Quark masses are chosen to fit the lightest spin-one quarkonia\nmasses most accurately. The resulting estimates for bbb and ccc states match\nestimates obtained in lattice QCD and in quark models. Masses of ccb and bbc\nstates are also estimated. The corresponding wave functions are invariant with\nrespect to boosts. In the ccb states, charm quarks tend to form diquarks. The\naccuracy of our approximate Hamiltonian can be estimated through comparison by\nincluding components with two gluons within the same method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 09:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 12:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

Despite its high accuracies, CNN has been shown to be easily\nfooled by some adversarial examples, indicating that CNN is not robust enough\nfor pattern classification. In this paper, we argue that the lack of robustness\nfor CNN is caused by the softmax layer, which is a totally discriminative model\nand based on the assumption of closed world (i.e., with a fixed number of\ncategories). To improve the robustness, we propose a novel learning framework\ncalled convolutional prototype learning (CPL). The advantage of using\nprototypes is that it can well handle the open world recognition problem and\ntherefore improve the robustness. Under the framework of CPL, we design\nmultiple classification criteria to train the network. Moreover, a prototype\nloss (PL) is proposed as a regularization to improve the intra-class\ncompactness of the feature representation, which can be viewed as a generative\nmodel based on the Gaussian assumption of different classes. Experiments on\nseveral datasets demonstrate that CPL can achieve comparable or even better\nresults than traditional CNN, and from the robustness perspective, CPL shows\ngreat advantages for both the rejection and incremental category learning\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 09:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-10"}

At\nthe nanoscale, local temperature differences can be harnessed to design novel\nthermal nanoelectronic devices or test quantum thermodynamical concepts.\nDetermining temperature locally is hence of particular relevance. Here, we\npresent a primary electron thermometer that allows probing the local\ntemperature of a single electron reservoir in single-electron devices. The\nthermometer is based on cyclic electron tunneling between a system with\ndiscrete energy levels and a single electron reservoir. When driven at a finite\nrate, close to a charge degeneracy point, the system behaves like a variable\ncapacitor whose magnitude and line-shape varies with temperature. In this\nexperiment, we demonstrate this type of thermometer using a quantum dot in a\nCMOS nanowire transistor. We drive cyclic electron tunneling by embedding the\ndevice in a radio-frequency resonator which in turn allows us to read the\nthermometer dispersively. We find that the full width at half maximum of the\nresonator phase response depends linearly with temperature via well known\nphysical law by using the ratio $k_\\text{B}/e$ between the Boltzmann constant\nand the electron charge.

We first\nderive a generalised gyromotion, in which the electric field is reduced to its\nmotional component. Steady-state is assumed, and simplified models of the\ncometary density and of the electron fluid are used to express the force\nexperienced by individual solar wind protons during the interaction. A\nthree-dimensional (3D) analytical expression of the gyration of two interacting\nplasma beams is obtained. Applying it to a comet case, the force on protons is\nalways perpendicular to their velocity and has an amplitude proportional to\n1/r^2. The solar wind deflection is obtained at any point in space. The\nresulting picture presents a caustic of intersecting trajectories, and a\ncircular region is found that is completely free of particles. The particles do\nnot lose any kinetic energy and this absence of deceleration, together with the\nsolar wind deflection pattern and the presence of a solar wind ion cavity, is\nin good agreement with the general results of the Rosetta mission. The\nqualitative match between the model and the in situ data highlights how\ndominant the motional electric field is throughout most of the interaction\nregion for the solar wind proton dynamics. The model provides a simple general\nkinetic description of how momentum is transferred between these two\ncollisionless plasmas. It also shows the potential of this semi-analytical\nmodel for a systematic quantitative comparison to the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 11:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

This trend supports evolutionary mixing processes as the explanation for\nNa overabundances seen in some red giants. In this same mass range, the surface\nAl abundance was shown to be constant. Our main aim was to extend the\ninvestigation of the Na and Al surface abundances to giants more massive than 3\nMsun. We sought to establish accurately whether the Na abundances keep\nincreasing with stellar mass or a plateau is reached. In addition, we\ninvestigated whether mixing can affect the surface abundance of Al in giants\nmore massive than 3 Msun. We obtained new high-resolution spectra of 20 giants\nin the field of 10 open clusters; 17 of these stars were found to be members of\n9 clusters. The giants have masses between 2.5 Msun and 5.6 Msun. Abundances of\nC, N, and O were determined using spectrum synthesis. The abundances of Na and\nAl were corrected for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects (non-LTE).\nMoreover, to extend the mass range of our sample, we collected from the\nliterature high-quality C, N, O, and Na abundances of 32 Galactic Cepheids with\naccurate masses in the range between 3 Msun and 14 Msun. The surface abundances\nof C, N, O, Na, and Al were compared to predictions of stellar evolution models\nwith and without the inclusion of rotation-induced mixing.

For giants above ~ 2.5 Msun, the Na abundances reach a\nplateau level of about [Na/Fe] ~ 0.20-0.25 dex (in non-LTE).

The study is based on a semi-analytical\nmodel developed by simultaneously solving the energy equation and the\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck/Navier-Stokes equations with the lubrication theory. The\nsemi-analytical model is shown to be mainly governed by eight parameters,\nincluding two temperature-related parameters (temperature and its gradient),\ntwo electrokinetic parameters ($\\zeta$ potential and the ratio of capillary\nradius to the Debye length $\\kappa_0a$) and four physical properties of cation\nand anion (i.e. Soret coefficient difference $\\Delta S_T$, average Soret\ncoefficient $S_T$, normalized difference in diffusivities $\\chi$ and intrinsic\nPeclet number $\\lambda$). It is found that the thermoelectric field is induced\nby three effects, which are respectively due to (1) the difference in the Soret\ncoefficients of cation and anion; (2) the selective ion diffusion resulting\nfrom the temperature-modified Boltzmann distribution of ions; (3) the advective\ntransport of ions caused by the fluid flow. The first thermoelectric effect\nprevails for lower $\\zeta$ potentials or large $\\kappa_0a$, while the second is\ndominant for higher $\\zeta$ potentials with very small $\\kappa_0a$.

In this situation we are interested in the optimal\nprocess which correctly classifies the input qubit with the largest probability\nallowed by quantum mechanics.

The problem of interest here is one where a completely inhomogeneous\nensemble of two-level systems (spins-1/2) are coupled to a single bosonic mode.\n  The long-time averaged magnetisation along the z-axis as well as the bosonic\noccupation are evaluated in the diagonal ensemble by performing the complete\nsum over the full Hilbert space for small system sizes. These numerically exact\nresults are independent of any particular choice of Hamiltonian and therefore\ndescribe general results valid for any member of this class of quantum\nintegrable models built out of the same underlying conserved quantities.\n  The collection of numerical results obtained can be qualitatively understood\nby a relaxation process for which, at infinitely strong coupling, every initial\nstate will relax to a common state where each spin is in a maximally coherent\nsuperposition of its $\\left|\\uparrow\\right>$ and $\\left|\\downarrow\\right>$\nstates, i.e. they are in-plane polarised, and consequently the bosonic mode is\nalso in a maximally coherent superposition of different occupation number\nstates. This bosonic coherence being a feature of a superradiant state, we\nshall loosely use the term superradiant steady-state to describe it.\n  A finite value of the coupling between the spins and the bosonic mode then\nleads to a long-time limit steady-state whose properties are qualitatively\ncaptured by a simple \"dynamical\" vision in which the coupling strength $V$\nplays the role of a time $t_V$ at which this \"relaxation process\" towards the\ncommon strong coupling superradiant steady-state is interrupted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 12:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Contrary to previous\nworks that try to learn an unsupervised representation of the Action Unit\nregions, we propose to directly and jointly estimate all AU intensities through\nheatmap regression, along with the location in the face where they cause\nvisible changes. Our approach aims to learn a pixel-wise regression function\nreturning a score per AU, which indicates an AU intensity at a given spatial\nlocation. Heatmap regression then generates an image, or channel, per AU, in\nwhich each pixel indicates the corresponding AU intensity. To generate the\nground-truth heatmaps for a target AU, the facial landmarks are first\nestimated, and a 2D Gaussian is drawn around the points where the AU is known\nto cause changes. The amplitude and size of the Gaussian is determined by the\nintensity of the AU. We show that using a single Hourglass network suffices to\nattain new state of the art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of such a\nsimple approach. The use of heatmap regression allows learning of a shared\nrepresentation between AUs without the need to rely on latent representations,\nas these are implicitly learned from the data.

We consider an idealized setting where the\nupdate time of an algorithm can take any arbitrary fractional value, and use\ninsights from this setting to come up with an appropriate potential function.\nConceptually, this framework mimics the idea of an LP-relaxation for an\noptimization problem. The difference is that instead of relaxing an integral\nobjective function, we relax the update time of an algorithm itself. We believe\nthat this technique will find further applications in the analysis of dynamic\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 13:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

However, random walk based embedding methods have two\nlimitations. First, random walk methods are fragile when the sampling frequency\nor the number of node sequences changes. Second, in disequilibrium networks\nsuch as highly biases networks, random walk methods often perform poorly due to\nthe lack of global network information. In order to solve the limitations, we\npropose in this paper a network diffusion based embedding method. To solve the\nfirst limitation, our method employs a diffusion driven process to capture both\ndepth information and breadth information. The time dimension is also attached\nto node sequences that can strengthen information preserving. To solve the\nsecond limitation, our method uses the network inference technique based on\ncascades to capture the global network information. To verify the performance,\nwe conduct experiments on node classification tasks using the learned\nrepresentations. Results show that compared with random walk based methods,\ndiffusion based models are more robust when samplings under each node is rare.\nWe also conduct experiments on a highly imbalanced network.

As a result, the reaction barrier is reduced\nconsiderably along the MRCL, and hydrogenation continues like a mechanical\nchain reaction.

The\nfusion center collects the single observation from each of the n sensors to\ndetect a binary parameter. The sensors are clustered into multiple groups, and\ndifferent groups follow different distributions under a given hypothesis. The\nkey challenge for the fusion center is the anonymity of sensors - although it\nknows the exact number of sensors and the distribution of observations in each\ngroup, it does not know which group each sensor belongs to. It is hence natural\nto consider it as a composite hypothesis testing problem. First, we propose an\noptimal test called mixture likelihood ratio test based on the ratio of the\nuniform mixture of all distributions under one hypothesis to that under the\nother. Optimality is shown by first arguing that symmetric tests are optimal,\nwhich do not depend on the order of observations across the sensors, and then\nproving that the mixture likelihood ratio test is optimal among all symmetric\ntests. Second, we focus on the Neyman-Pearson setting and characterize the\nerror exponent of the worst-case type-II error probability as n tends to\ninfinity, assuming the number of sensors in each group is proportional to n.\nFinally, we generalize our result to find the collection of all achievable\ntype-I and type-II error exponents, where the boundary of the region can be\nobtained by solving a convex program. Our results elucidate the price of\nanonymity in heterogeneous distributed detection, and can be extended to M-ary\nhypothesis testing with heterogeneous observations generated according to\nhidden latent variables. The results are also applied to distributed detection\nunder Byzantine attacks, which hints that the conventional approach based on\nsimple hypothesis testing might be too pessimistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 14:29:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 23:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

Our experiment includes 19\nvolunteers using a virtual reality headset to look at 30 scenarios filmed in\n360{\\textdegree} from the point of view of a passenger sitting in the driver's\nseat of an autonomous car.They were asked to say \"stop\" when they felt\ndiscomfort visualizing the scenarios.As said, the scenarios voluntarily avoid\ncollision effect as we do not want to measure fear but discomfort.The scenarios\ninvolve one or three pedestrians walking past the car at different distances\nfrom the wings of the car, relative to the direction of motion of the car, on\nboth sides.

Considering the two common nonlinear\nenergy harvester models introduced in the literature, two sets of constraints\nare considered. First the capacity is studied under average power (AP), peak\namplitude (PA) and receiver delivery power (RDP) constraints. The RDP\nconstraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the\nchannel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of\nan AWGN channel under AP and RDP constraints is the same as the capacity of an\nAWGN channel under an AP constraint, however, depending on the two constraints,\nit can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that\nunder AP, PA and RDP constraints, the amplitude of the optimal inputs is\ndiscrete with a finite number of mass points.

Temporal discretization is carried out by low-storage\nexplicit Runge-Kutta schemes and the arbitrary derivative (ADER) method. For\nADER, we propose a flexible basis change approach that combines cheap face\nintegrals with cell evaluation using collocated nodes and quadrature points.\nAdditionally, a degree reduction for the optimized cell evaluation is presented\nto decrease the computational cost when evaluating higher order spatial\nderivatives as required in ADER time stepping.

At the same time, an all-normal\nchromatic dispersion profile over an entire transmission window, and small\ndispersion of nonlinearity in the developed fibers, would facilitate use of\ncommercially available femtosecond fiber lasers as pump sources for the\ndeveloped fibers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 12:57:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 10:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

DR schemes can be used to harness residential devices'\nflexibility and to utilize it to achieve social and financial objectives.\nHowever, existing DR schemes suffer from low user participation as they fail at\ntaking into account the users' requirements. First, DR schemes are highly\ndemanding for the users, as users need to provide direct information, e.g. via\nsurveys, on their energy consumption preferences. Second, the user utility\nmodels based on these surveys are hard-coded and do not adapt over time. Third,\nthe existing scheduling techniques require the users to input their energy\nrequirements on a daily basis. As an alternative, this paper proposes a DR\nscheme for user-oriented direct load-control of residential appliances\noperations. Instead of relying on user surveys to evaluate the user utility, we\npropose an online data-driven approach for estimating user utility functions,\npurely based on available load consumption data, that adaptively models the\nusers' preference over time. Our scheme is based on a day-ahead scheduling\ntechnique that transparently prescribes the users with optimal device operation\nschedules that take into account both financial benefits and user-perceived\nquality of service. To model day-ahead user energy demand and flexibility, we\npropose a probabilistic approach for generating flexibility models under\nuncertainty. Results on both real-world and simulated datasets show that our DR\nscheme can provide significant financial benefits while preserving the\nuser-perceived quality of service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 12:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Existing frameworks\nmanaging and orchestrating MEC and NFV are either tightly coupled or completely\nseparated. The former design is inflexible and increases the complexity of one\nframework. Whereas, the latter leads to inefficient use of computation\nresources because information are not shared. We introduce APMEC, a dedicated\nframework for MEC while enabling the collaboration with the management and\norchestration (MANO) frameworks for NFV.

These devices are known as Programmable System on Chip (PSoC). Their ARM\ncores (embedded in the processing system or PS) communicates with the\nprogrammable logic cells (PL) using ARM-standard AXI buses. In this paper we\nanalyses the performance of exhaustive data transfers between PS and PL for a\nXilinx Zynq FPGA in a co-design real scenario for Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN) accelerator, which processes, in dedicated hardware, a stream of visual\ninformation from a neuromorphic visual sensor for classification. In the PS\nside, a Linux operating system is running, which recollects visual events from\nthe neuromorphic sensor into a normalized frame, and then it transfers these\nframes to the accelerator of multi-layered CNNs, and read results, using an\nAXI-DMA bus in a per-layer way. As these kind of accelerators try to process\ninformation as quick as possible, data bandwidth becomes critical and\nmaintaining a good balanced data throughput rate requires some considerations.\nWe present and evaluate several data partitioning techniques to improve the\nbalance between RX and TX transfer and two different ways of transfers\nmanagement: through a polling routine at the userlevel of the OS, and through a\ndedicated interrupt-based kernellevel driver. We demonstrate that for longer\nenough packets, the kernel-level driver solution gets better timing in\ncomputing a CNN classification example. Main advantage of using kernel-level\ndriver is to have safer solutions and to have tasks scheduling in the OS to\nmanage other important processes for our application, like frames collection\nfrom sensors and their normalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 08:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

Generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) emerges as an unsupervised learning approach with promising\naccuracy and are under extensively study.

In this work, we proposed a holistic solution for fast\nand energy-efficient GAN computation through a memristor-based neuromorphic\nsystem.

We also proposed an efficient data\nflow for optimal parallelism training and testing, depending on the computation\ncorrelations between different computing blocks. To compute the unique and\ncomplex loss of GAN, we developed a diff-block with optimized accuracy and\nperformance.
