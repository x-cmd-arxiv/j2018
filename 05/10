The structure is\noperated in the regime of collective strong coupling, giving rise to hybrid\nexciton-polariton modes composed of a Tamm-plasmon resonance, GaAs quantum well\nexcitons and two-dimensional excitons confined in a monolayer of MoSe2.\nPolariton condensation in a monolayer crystal manifests by a superlinear\nincrease of emission intensity from the hybrid polariton mode at injection\npowers as low as 4.8 pJ/pulse, as well as its density-dependent blueshift and a\ndramatic collapse of the emission linewidth as a hallmark of temporal\ncoherence. Importantly, we observe a significant spin-polarization in the\ninjected polariton condensate, a fingerprint of the core property of monolayer\nexcitons subject to spin-valley locking. The observed effects clearly underpin\nthe perspective of building novel highly non-linear valleytronic devices based\non light-matter fluids, coherent bosonic light sources based on atomically thin\nmaterials, and paves the way towards studying materials with unconventional\ntopological properties in the framework of bosonic condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 17:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

In this\npaper, we demonstrate that a chiral free-fermion theory can live on an\nultra-local spacetime lattice if we allow the Lagrangian to be non-hermitian.\nRather than a violation of unitarity, the non-hermitian structure of our\nLagrangian arises because time is discrete, and we show that our model is obeys\nan elementary unitarity condition: namely, that the norm of the two-point\nfunctions conserves probability. Beyond unitarity, our model displays several\nsurprising properties: it is formulated directly in Minkowskian time; it has\nexactly Lorentz invariant dynamics for all frequencies and momenta (in the\nlarge volume limit); and it is free from all gauge anomalies, despite the\nprediction from field theory that it should suffer one. We show that our model\nis a discrete time description of a single chiral edge mode of several recently\nproposed $2+1$d Floquet models. That the chiral edge can be treated without the\nrest of the $2+1$d system, even when coupled to a gauge field, implies that the\nFloquet models are radically different from Integer Quantum Hall models, which\nalso support chiral edge modes. Furthermore, the Floquet results imply that our\nmodel can be physically realized, which presents an opportunity for gauge\ntheories to be simulated in a condensed matter or cold atom context. Our\nresults present a solution to the `Chiral-fermion problem:' a chiral field\ntheory can indeed be defined on an ultra-local spacetime lattice, and we\naddress how our model avoids several no-go arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 18:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

The mass outflow rates are 12-400 Msun/yr and the inclination\ncorrected average velocity of the outflowing gas 350-550 km/s (v_max = 500-900\nkm/s). The origin of these outflows can be explained by the nuclear starbursts\nalthough the contribution of an obscured AGN can not be completely ruled out.\nThe position angle (PA) of the outflowing gas along the kinematic minor axis of\nthe nuclear molecular disk suggests that the outflow axis is perpendicular to\nthe disk for three of these outflows. Only in one case, the outflow PA is\nclearly not along the kinematic minor axis.

However, we estimate that only 15-30% of the outflowing gas\nwill escape the gravitational potential of the nucleus. The majority of the\noutflowing gas will return to the disk after 5-10 Myr and become available to\nform new stars. Therefore, these outflows will not likely quench the nuclear\nstarbursts. These outflows would be consistent with being driven by radiation\npressure (momentum-driven) only if the coupling between radiation and dust\nincreases with increasing SF rates. This can be achieved if the dust optical\ndepth is higher in objects with higher SF. The relatively small sizes (<1 kpc)\nand dynamical times (<3 Myr) of the cold molecular outflows suggests that\nmolecular gas cannot survive longer in the outflow environment or that it\ncannot form efficiently beyond these distances or times.

However, time is of the essence to take full\nadvantage of this opportunity. JWST, although delayed, will still complete its\nnominal five year mission on a timeline that motivates rapid identification,\nconfirmation, and mass measurement of the top atmospheric characterization\ntargets from TESS. Beyond JWST, future dedicated missions for atmospheric\nstudies such as ARIEL require the discovery and confirmation of several hundred\nadditional sub-Jovian size planets (R_p < 10 R_Earth) orbiting bright stars,\nbeyond those known today, to ensure a successful statistical census of\nexoplanet atmospheres. Ground-based ELTs will also contribute to surveying the\natmospheres of the transiting planets discovered by TESS. Here we present a set\nof two straightforward analytic metrics, quantifying the expected\nsignal-to-noise in transmission and thermal emission spectroscopy for a given\nplanet, that will allow the top atmospheric characterization targets to be\nreadily identified among the TESS planet candidates. Targets that meet our\nproposed threshold values for these metrics would be encouraged for rapid\nfollow-up and confirmation via radial velocity mass measurements.

The study of solar-like oscillations\nobserved in red giant stars by these satellites allows a better understanding\nof the different physical processes occurring in their interiors. In\nparticular, the study of the mode excitation and damping is a promising way to\nimprove our understanding of stellar physics that has, so far, been performed\nonly on a limited number of targets. Aims: the recent asteroseismic\ncharacterization of the evolutionary status for a large number of red giants\nallows us to study the physical processes acting in the interior of red giants\nand how they are modify during stellar evolution. In this work, we aim to\nobtain information on the excitation and damping of pressure modes through the\nmeasurement of the stars' pressure mode widths and amplitudes and to analyze\nhow they are modified with stellar evolution. The objective is to bring\nobservational constraints on the modeling of the physical processes behind mode\nexcitation and damping. Methods: we fit the frequency spectra of red giants\nwith well defined evolutionary status using Lorentzians functions to derive the\npressure mode widths and amplitudes. To strengthen our conclusions, we used two\ndifferent fitting techniques. Results: pressure mode widths and amplitudes were\ndetermined for more than 5000 red giants. With a stellar sample two orders of\nmagnitude larger than previous results, we confirmed that the mode width\ndepends on stellar evolution and varies with stellar effective temperature. In\naddition, we discovered that the mode width depends on stellar mass. We also\nconfirmed observationally the influence of the stellar metallicity on the mode\namplitudes, as predicted by models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 18:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

We assume that each task has a\ndemand that should be satisfied but not exceeded, i.e., there is an optimal\nnumber of ants that should be working on this task at a given time. The goal is\nto assign a near-optimal number of workers to each task in a distributed manner\nand without explicit access to the values of the demands nor the number of ants\nworking on the task.\n  We seek to answer the question of how the quality of task allocation depends\non the accuracy of assessing whether too many (overload) or not enough (lack)\nants are currently working on a given task. Concretely, we address the open\nquestion of solving task allocation in the model where each ant receives\nfeedback that depends on the deficit defined as the (possibly negative)\ndifference between the optimal demand and the current number of workers in the\ntask. The feedback is modeled as a random variable that takes value lack or\noverload with probability given by a sigmoid of the deficit. Each ants receives\nthe feedback independently, but the higher the overload or lack of workers for\na task, the more likely it is that all the ants will receive the same, correct\nfeedback from this task; the closer the deficit is to zero, the less reliable\nthe feedback becomes. We measure the performance of task allocation algorithms\nusing the notion of regret, defined as the absolute value of the deficit summed\nover all tasks and summed over time.\n  We propose a simple, constant-memory, self-stabilizing, distributed algorithm\nthat quickly converges from any initial distribution to a near-optimal\nassignment.

Recent studies indicate that\ndoping with chloride increases the ion conductivity of Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$,\nalthough to a much lesser extent than expected if chloride is assumed as a\ndonor dopant [Gerbig et al., Adv. Mater.,2013, 25, 3129]. Subsequently, it has\nbeen shown that the addition of lithium chloride, LiCl, to the battery\nelectrolyte increases its discharge capacity while this effect is not observed\nwith other halogens [Matsuda et al., J.

We have calculated the formation\nenergies of the different defects and impurities and we analysed how they\naffect the activation barriers and diffusion coefficients . We have\ndemonstrated that the chloride does not behave like a donor dopant, thus\nexplaining the meager increase of the ionic conductivity experimentally\nobserved neither it promotes the polaron formation and its mobility. We have\nalso found that chloride does not present any special behaviour among the\nhalogen series. Our results reveal that all the studied configurations\nassociated with the halogen defects do not derive in metallic states nor extra\npolarons that would increase considerably the electronic conductivity. This is\nmainly due to the ionic characteristics of the Li$_{2}$O$_{2}$ crystal and the\ncapability of the oxygen dimers to adapt its valence rather than to the nature\nof the dopant itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 18:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

In this work, we propose a tumor\nsegmentation framework based on the novel concept of persistent homology\nprofiles (PHPs). For a given image patch, the homology profiles are derived by\nefficient computation of persistent homology, which is an algebraic tool from\nhomology theory. We propose an efficient way of computing topological\npersistence of an image, alternative to simplicial homology. The PHPs are\ndevised to distinguish tumor regions from their normal counterparts by modeling\nthe atypical characteristics of tumor nuclei. We propose two variants of our\nmethod for tumor segmentation: one that targets speed without compromising\naccuracy and the other that targets higher accuracy. The fast version is based\non the selection of exemplar image patches from a convolution neural network\n(CNN) and patch classification by quantifying the divergence between the PHPs\nof exemplars and the input image patch. Detailed comparative evaluation shows\nthat the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than competing algorithms\nwhile achieving comparable results. The accurate version combines the PHPs and\nhigh-level CNN features and employs a multi-stage ensemble strategy for image\npatch labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of PHPs\nand CNN features outperforms competing algorithms. This study is performed on\ntwo independently collected colorectal datasets containing adenoma,\nadenocarcinoma, signet and healthy cases. Collectively, the accurate tumor\nsegmentation produces the highest average patch-level F1-score, as compared\nwith competing algorithms, on malignant and healthy cases from both the\ndatasets. Overall the proposed framework highlights the utility of persistent\nhomology for histopathology image analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 19:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

The combination of both these components into telepresence\nsystems, however, comes with significant technical challenges. All approaches\nproposed so far are extremely demanding on input and output devices, compute\nresources and transmission bandwidth, and they do not reach the level of\nimmediacy required for applications such as remote collaboration. Here, we\nintroduce what we believe is the first practical client-server system for\nreal-time capture and many-user exploration of static 3D scenes. Our system is\nbased on the observation that interactive frame rates are sufficient for\ncapturing and reconstruction, and real-time performance is only required on the\nclient site to achieve lag-free view updates when rendering the 3D model.\nStarting from this insight, we extend previous voxel block hashing frameworks\nby overcoming internal dependencies and introducing, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first thread-safe GPU hash map data structure that is robust\nunder massively concurrent retrieval, insertion and removal of entries on a\nthread level. We further propose a novel transmission scheme for volume data\nthat is specifically targeted to Marching Cubes geometry reconstruction and\nenables a 90% reduction in bandwidth between server and exploration clients.\nThe resulting system poses very moderate requirements on network bandwidth,\nlatency and client-side computation, which enables it to rely entirely on\nconsumer-grade hardware, including mobile devices.

To\nensure survivability, scalability, and availability of a storage service in the\npresence of failures, traditional approaches for atomic memory emulation, in\nmessage passing environments, replicate the objects across multiple servers.\nCompared to replication based algorithms, erasure code-based atomic memory\nalgorithms has much lower storage and communication costs, but usually, they\nare harder to design. The difficulty of designing atomic memory algorithms\nfurther grows, when the set of servers may be changed to ensure survivability\nof the service over software and hardware upgrades, while avoiding service\ninterruptions. Atomic memory algorithms for performing server reconfiguration,\nin the replicated systems, are very few, complex, and are still part of an\nactive area of research; reconfigurations of erasure-code based algorithms are\nnon-existent.\n  In this work, we present ARES, an algorithmic framework that allows\nreconfiguration of the underlying servers, and is particularly suitable for\nerasure-code based algorithms emulating atomic objects. ARES introduces new\nconfigurations while keeping the service available.

The algorithm is motivated by the application of array\nimaging. We describe it for a generic hyperbolic system that applies to\nacoustic, electromagnetic or elastic waves in a scattering medium modeled by an\nunknown coefficient called the reflectivity. The goal of imaging is to invert\nthe nonlinear mapping from the reflectivity to the array data. Many existing\nimaging methodologies ignore the nonlinearity i.e., operate under the\nassumption that the Born (single scattering) approximation is accurate. This\nleads to image artifacts when multiple scattering is significant. Our algorithm\nseeks to transform the array data to those corresponding to the Born\napproximation, so it can be used as a pre-processing step for any linear\ninversion method. The nonlinear data transformation algorithm is based on a\nreduced order model defined by a proxy wave propagator operator that has four\nimportant properties. First, it is data driven, meaning that it is constructed\nfrom the data alone, with no knowledge of the medium. Second, it can be\nfactorized in two operators that have an approximately affine dependence on the\nunknown reflectivity. This allows the computation of the Fr\\'{e}chet derivative\nof the reflectivity to the data mapping which gives the Born approximation.\nThird, the algorithm involves regularization which balances numerical stability\nand data fitting with accuracy of the order of the standard deviation of\nadditive data noise. Fourth, the algebraic nature of the algorithm makes it\napplicable to scalar (acoustic) and vectorial (elastic, electromagnetic) wave\ndata without any specific modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 22:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

The structure\nparameters of the synchrotron bumps for 68 blazars and those of the\ninverse-Compton bumps for 56 blzars are obtained. Then, we adopted statistical\nanalysis to the parameters (curvature, peak frequency, peak luminosity,\nbolometric luminosity, and X/$\\gamma$-ray spectral indexes). From our analysis\nand discussions, we can get following conclusions: 1. There is a clear positive\ncorrelation between the synchrotron peak frequency, $\\log \\nu_p^s$, and the\ninverse-Compton peak frequency $\\log \\nu_p^{IC}$, and that between the\nsynchrotron peak luminosity, $\\log \\nu_p^s L_p^s$, and the inverse-Compton peak\nluminosity, $\\log \\nu_p^{IC}L_p^{IC}$. 2. The correlation between the peak\nfrequency and the curvature of synchrotron bump is clearly different from that\nof the inverse-Compton bump, which further indicates that there are different\nemission mechanisms between them. 3.

The transition is between the N\\'eel\nphase and a twofold degenerate valence bond solid (lattice-symmetry-breaking)\nphase. The combined order parameter at the transition is effectively a\nfour-component superspin. It has been argued that in some weakly first order\n`pseudocritical' deconfined phase transitions, the renormalization group flow\ncan take the system very close to the ordered fixed point of the symmetric\n$O(N)$ sigma model, where $N$ is the total number of `soft' order parameter\ncomponents, despite the fact that $O(N)$ is not a microscopic symmetry.

Cr interstitials diffuse preferably along the diagonal of corundum\nlattice in a two step process via an intermediate defect complex comprising a\nCr interstitial and an adjacent Cr Frenkel defect in the neighboring Cr\nbilayer. This mechanism is similar to that of the vacancy mediated Cr diffusion\nalong the c-axis with intermediate Cr vacancy and Cr Frenkel defect\ncombination. In contrast, O interstitials diffuse via bond switching mechanism.\nO interstitials in -1 and -2 charge states have very high mobility compared to\nneutral O interstitials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 01:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 00:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

Recently, Kuramoto's scenario was shown to hold\nfor a large class of coupled systems on convergent families of deterministic\nand random graphs. Guided by these results, in the present work, we study\nseveral model problems illustrating the link between network topology and\nsynchronization in coupled dynamical systems.\n  First, we identify several families of graphs, for which the transition to\nsynchronization in the Kuramoto model starts at the same critical value of the\ncoupling strength and proceeds in practically the same way.

The former family of graphs endows the\nKuramoto model with very good synchronizability: the synchronization threshold\ncan be made arbitrarily low by varying the parameter of the power law degree\ndistribution. For the Kuramoto model on small-world graphs, in addition to the\ntransition to synchronization, we identify a new bifurcation leading to stable\nrandom twisted states.

Owing to the complexity of multi-layer models, an implicit\nassumption in Linsker's and subsequent papers has been that propagation delay\nis homogeneous and plays little functional role in neural behaviour. We relax\nthis assumption to examine the impact of distance-dependent axonal propagation\ndelay on neural learning. We show that propagation delay induces low-pass\nfiltering by dispersing the arrival times of spikes from presynaptic neurons,\nproviding a natural correlation cancellation mechanism for distal connections.\nThe cut-off frequency decreases as the radial propagation delay within a layer\nincreases relative to propagation delay between the layers, introducing an\nupper limit on temporal resolution. Given that the PSP also acts as a low-pass\nfilter, we show that the effective time constant of each should enable the\nprocessing of similar scales of temporal information. This result has\nimplications for the visual system, in which receptive field size and, thus,\nradial propagation delay, increases with eccentricity. Furthermore, the network\nresponse is frequency dependent since higher frequencies require increased\ninput amplitude to compensate for attenuation. This concords with\nfrequency-dependent contrast sensitivity in the visual system, which changes\nwith eccentricity and receptive field size.

An overwhelming majority of the pure state\nlooks almost identical if we neglect macroscopic non-local correlations,\nsuggesting that thermal equilibrium is the collection of the typical\nproperties. Quantum entanglement, which characterizes a non-local correlation,\nalso has a typical behavior in equilibrium systems. However, it remains elusive\nwhether there is a typical behavior of entanglement in dynamical\nnon-equilibrium systems. To investigate the typicality, we consider a situation\nwhere a system in a pure state starts to share entanglement with its\nenvironment system due to the interaction between them. Assuming the initial\nstate is randomly chosen from an ensemble of pure states, a criteria for the\ntypicality of the R\\'enyi entropies is presented. In addition, it is\nanalytically proven that the second R\\'enyi entropy has a typical behavior in\ntwo cases. The first one is an energy dissipation process in a multiple-qubit\nsystem which is initially in a random pure state in an energy shell. Since the\ntypical behavior is qualitatively the same as the prediction of the Page curve\nconjecture, it gives the first proof of the Page curve conjecture in a\ndynamical process. In the second case, the typicality is proven for any\ndynamics described by a multiple-product of a single-qudit channel when the\nsystem is initially in a pure state randomly chosen from the whole Hilbert\nspace. This result shows that entanglement typicality is not a specific feature\nof energy dissipating processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 04:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 01:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

This is accomplished bypassing the usual need of numerically\nsolving the relative EOB dynamics described by a set of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs). Under the assumption that radiation reaction is small, the\nHamilton's equations for the momenta can be solved {\\it analytically} for given\nvalues of the relative separation. Time and orbital phase are then recovered by\nsimple numerical quadratures. For the least-adiabatic BBH case, equal-mass,\nquasi-extremal spins anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, 6PA/8PA\norders are able to generate waveforms that accumulate less than $10^{-3}$ rad\nof phase difference with respect to the complete EOB ones up to $\\sim 3$ orbits\nbefore merger.

We measure condensation along a cloud's wake, with and\nwithout the presence of an ambient magnetic field, using two- (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D), high-resolution simulations.

The magnetic field suppresses the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability responsible for the ablation and consequent mixing of a cloud with\nhalo gas which drives the condensation. This effect is universal across\ndifferent cloud properties (density, metallicity, velocity) and magnetic field\nproperties (strength and orientation). Simple convergence tests demonstrate\nthat resolving the gas on progressively smaller scales leads to even less\ncondensation. While condensation still occurs in all cases, our results show\nthat an ambient magnetic field drastically lowers the efficiency of\nfountain-driven accretion and likely also accretion from condensation around\nhigh-velocity clouds.

We hence introduce a soft-margin softmax\nfunction to explicitly encourage the discrimination between different classes.\nOn the other hand, the learned classifier of softmax loss is weak. We propose\nto assemble multiple these weak classifiers to a strong one, inspired by the\nrecognition that the diversity among weak classifiers is critical to a good\nensemble.

An\nadditional benefit is that marginal likelihood estimates are unbiased. In\ncontrast to NS, the analysis of NS-SMC does not require the (unrealistic)\nassumption that the simulated samples be independent. As the original NS\nalgorithm is a special case of NS-SMC, this provides insights as to why NS\nseems to produce accurate estimates despite a typical violation of its\nassumptions. For applications of NS-SMC, we give advice on tuning MCMC kernels\nin an automated manner via a preliminary pilot run, and present a new method\nfor appropriately choosing the number of MCMC repeats at each iteration.\nFinally, a numerical study is conducted where the performance of NS-SMC and\ntemperature-annealed SMC is compared on several challenging and realistic\nproblems.

A particular\nattention will be devoted to its consequences when applied to cosmological\ninflation. Primarily, affine spacetime, composed of geodesics with no notion of\nlength and angle, accommodates gravity but not matter. The thesis study is\nexpected to reveal salient properties of matter dynamics in affine spacetime\nand may reveal an intimate connection between vacuum state and metrical\ngravity. An interesting application of the framework is the inflationary\nregime, where it is shown that affine gravity prefers only a unique metric\ntensor such that the transition from nonminimal to minimal coupling of the\ninflaton is performed only via redefinition of the latter. This allows us to\navoid the use of the so called conformal frames. In fact, unlike metric\ngravity, the metric tensor in affine gravity is generated and not postulated a\npriori, thus this tensor is absent in the actions and conformal transformation\ndoes not make sense. Last but not least, we try to show how metric gravity can\nbe induced through a simple structure that contains only affine connection and\nscalar fields. General relativity arises classically only at the vacuum, and\nthis view of gravity may be considered as a new way to inducing metric\nelasticity of space, not through quantum corrections as in standard induced\ngravity, but only classically. The thesis is concluded by analyzing affine\ngravity in a particular higher-dimensional manifold (product of two spaces) in\nan attempt to understand both, the cosmological constant and matter\ndynamically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 12:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

A threshold $\\zeta_{\\rm th}$ for the\ncurvature perturbation is somewhat inappropriate for this purpose, because it\ndepends significantly on environmental effects, not essential to the local\ndynamics. By contrast, a threshold $\\delta_{\\rm th}$ for the density\nperturbation at horizon crossing seems to provide a more robust criterion. On\nthe other hand, the density perturbation is known to be bounded above by a\nmaximum limit $\\delta_{\\rm max}$, and given that $\\delta_{\\rm th}$ is\ncomparable to $\\delta_{\\rm max}$, the density perturbation will be far from\nGaussian near or above the threshold. In this paper, we provide a new plausible\nestimate for the primordial black hole abundance based on peak theory. In our\napproach, we assume that the curvature perturbation is given as a random\nGaussian field with the power spectrum characterized by a single scale, while\nan optimized criterion for PBH formation is imposed, based on the locally\naveraged density perturbation. Both variables are related by the full nonlinear\nexpression derived in the long-wavelength approximation of general relativity.\nWe do not introduce a window function, and the scale of the inhomogeneity is\nintroduced as a random variable in the peak theory. We find that the mass\nspectrum is shifted to larger mass scales by one order of magnitude or so,\ncompared to a conventional calculation. The abundance of PBHs becomes\nsignificantly larger than the conventional one, by many orders of magnitude,\nmainly due to the optimized criterion for PBH formation and the removal of the\nsuppresion associated with a window function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 12:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 05:26:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 01:20:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 00:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 08:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 01:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

This work focuses on the first task, in the context of a\nhybrid MPI+X paradigm. Although we will describe algorithms in the FE context,\na similar strategy can be straightforwardly applied to other discretization\nmethods, like the finite volume method. The matrix assembly consists of a loop\nover the elements of the MPI partition to compute element matrices and\nright-hand sides and their assemblies in the local system to each MPI\npartition. In a MPI+X hybrid parallelism context, X has consisted traditionally\nof loop parallelism using OpenMP. Several strategies have been proposed in the\nliterature to implement this loop parallelism, like coloring or substructuring\ntechniques to circumvent the race condition that appears when assembling the\nelement system into the local system. The main drawback of the first technique\nis the decrease of the IPC due to bad spatial locality. The second technique\navoids this issue but requires extensive changes in the implementation, which\ncan be cumbersome when several element loops should be treated. We propose an\nalternative, based on the task parallelism of the element loop using some\nextensions to the OpenMP programming model. The taskification of the assembly\nsolves both aforementioned problems. In addition, dynamic load balance will be\napplied using the DLB library, especially efficient in the presence of hybrid\nmeshes, where the relative costs of the different elements is impossible to\nestimate a priori. This paper presents the proposed methodology, its\nimplementation and its validation through the solution of large computational\nmechanics problems up to 16k cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 16:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

These long-range contacts have been attributed to\nvarious nucleoid-associated proteins, including the ATPase SMC condensin.\nAlthough the molecular structure of these ATPases has been mapped in detail, it\nstill remains unclear by which physical mechanisms they collectively generate\nlong-range chromosomal contacts. Here, we develop a computational model that\ncaptures the subtle interplay between molecular-scale activity of slip-links\nand large-scale chromosome organization. We first consider a scenario in which\nthe ATPase activity of slip-links regulates their DNA-recruitment near the\norigin of replication, while the slip-link dynamics is assumed to be diffusive.\nWe find that such diffusive slip-links can collectively organize the entire\nchromosome into a state with aligned arms, but not within physiological\nconstraints.

More specifically, these\ncriteria are exclusively determined by the eigenvalues of the velocity gradient\ntensor or the related invariants and thereby can be regarded as\neigenvalue-based criteria. However, these criteria have been found to be\nplagued with two shortcomings: (1) these criteria fail to identify the swirl\naxis or orientation; (2) these criteria are prone to contamination by shearing.\nIn this paper, an alternative eigenvector-based definition of Rortex is\nintroduced. The real eigenvector of the velocity gradient tensor is used to\ndefine the direction of Rortex as the possible axis of the local fluid\nrotation, and the rotational strength obtained in the plane perpendicular to\nthe possible local axis is defined as the magnitude of Rortex. This alternative\ndefinition is mathematically equivalent to our previous one but allows a much\nmore efficient implementation. Furthermore, a complete and systematic\ninterpretation of scalar, vector and tensor versions of Rortex is presented to\nprovide a unified and clear characterization of the instantaneous local rigidly\nrotation. By relying on the tensor interpretation of Rortex, a new\ndecomposition of the velocity gradient tensor is proposed to shed light on the\nanalytical relations between Rortex and eigenvalue-based criteria. It can be\nobserved that shearing always manifests its effect on the imaginary part of the\ncomplex eigenvalues and consequently contaminates eigenvalue-based criteria,\nwhile Rortex can exclude the shearing contamination and accurately quantify the\nlocal rotational strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 16:19:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 20:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

This paper proposes\nan event-driven OF algorithm called adaptive block-matching optical flow\n(ABMOF). ABMOF uses time slices of accumulated DVS events.

The main\ndifficulty is in reasoning about the view of the memory obtained by the\nthreads, because as they execute, threads observe different fragments of memory\nfrom different points in time. Until today, every linearizability proof has\ntackled this challenge from scratch.\n  We present a unifying proof argument for the correctness of unsynchronized\ntraversals, and apply it to prove the linearizability of several highly\nconcurrent search data structures, including an optimistic self-balancing\nbinary search tree, the Lazy List and a lock-free skip list. Our framework\nharnesses {\\em sequential reasoning} about the view of a thread, considering\nthe thread as if it traverses the data structure without interference from\nother operations. Our key contribution is showing that properties of\nreachability along search paths can be deduced for concurrent traversals from\nsuch interference-free traversals, when certain intuitive conditions are met.\nBasing the correctness of traversals on such \\emph{local view arguments}\ngreatly simplifies linearizability proofs.\n  To apply our framework, the user proves that the data structure satisfies two\nconditions: (1) acyclicity of the order on memory, even when it is considered\nacross intermediate memory states, and (2) preservation of search paths to\nlocations modified by interfering writes. Establishing the conditions, as well\nas the full linearizability proof utilizing our proof argument, reduces to\nsimple concurrent reasoning.

Berstel found that the number of erasures can be linearly limited\nif the grammar is in Greibach normal form; Berstel and Boasson (and later,\nindependently, Okhotin) proved a non-erasing variant of CST for grammars in\nDouble Greibach Normal Form. In all these CST statements, however, the size of\nthe Dyck alphabet $\\Omega$ depends on the grammar size for $L$. In the Stanley\nvariant of the CST, $|\\Omega|$ only depends on $|\\Sigma|$ and not on the\ngrammar, but the homomorphism erases many more symbols than in the other\nversions of CST; also, the regular language $R$ is strictly locally testable\nbut not local. We prove a new version of CST which combines both features of\nbeing non-erasing and of using a grammar-independent alphabet. In our\nconstruction, $|\\Omega|$ is polynomial in $|\\Sigma|$, namely\n$O(|\\Sigma|^{46})$, and the regular language $R$ is strictly locally testable.\nUsing a recent generalization of Medvedev's homomorphic characterization of\nregular languages, we prove that the degree in the polynomial dependence of\n$|\\Omega|$ on $|\\Sigma|$ may be reduced to just 2 in the case of linear\ngrammars in Double Greibach Normal Form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 14:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

A crucial test of different energy loss mechanisms is how the energy\nloss depends on the length of traversed medium (so-called path-length\ndependence). The upcoming experimental results will allow to, at least in\nprinciple, for the first time, clearly observe how the energy loss changes with\nthe size of the medium, in particular, by comparing already available $Pb+Pb$\nmeasurements with now upcoming $Xe+Xe$ data at the LHC. However, in practice,\nto actually perform such test, it becomes crucial to chose an optimal\nobservable.

The key idea is to\ndeliberately reformulate the VINS with respect to a moving local frame, rather\nthan a fixed global frame of reference as in the standard world-centric VINS,\nin order to obtain relative motion estimates of higher accuracy for updating\nglobal poses. As an immediate advantage of this robocentric formulation, the\nproposed R-VIO can start from an arbitrary pose, without the need to align the\ninitial orientation with the global gravitational direction. More importantly,\nwe analytically show that the linearized robocentric VINS does not undergo the\nobservability mismatch issue as in the standard world-centric counterpart which\nwas identified in the literature as the main cause of estimation inconsistency.\nAdditionally, we investigate in-depth the special motions that degrade the\nperformance in the world-centric formulation and show that such degenerate\ncases can be easily compensated in the proposed robocentric formulation,\nwithout resorting to additional sensors as in the world-centric formulation,\nthus leading to better robustness. The proposed R-VIO algorithm has been\nextensively tested through both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world\nexperiments with different sensor platforms navigating in different\nenvironments, and shown to achieve better (or competitive at least) performance\nthan the state-of-the-art VINS, in terms of consistency, accuracy and\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 15:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

Following a procedure developed by Dalibard, Dupont-Roc\nand Cohen-Tannoudji, our intention is to identify in a quantitative way the\ncontributions of vacuum fluctuations and the radiation reaction to the\ngeneration of quantum entanglement and to the degradation of entangled states.\nWe find that when the distance between two atoms larger than the characteristic\nlength scale, the rate of variation of atomic energy in the de Sitter-invariant\nvacuum behaves differently compared with that in the thermal Minkowski\nspacetime. In particular, the generation and degradation of quantum\nentanglement can be enhanced or inhibited, which are dependent not only on the\nspecific entangled state but also on the distance between the atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 00:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

In this paper, we propose\nthree network architectures of varying complexity to achieve multilabel\nsemantic segmentation of facade images while exploiting their unique\ncharacteristics. Specifically, we propose a MULTIFACSEGNET architecture to\nassign multiple labels to each pixel, a SEPARABLE architecture as a low-rank\nformulation that encourages extraction of rectangular elements, and a\nCOMPATIBILITY network that simultaneously seeks segmentation across facade\nelement types allowing the network to 'see' intermediate output probabilities\nof the various facade element classes.

Exploration of automatic facial micro-expression\nrecognition systems is relatively new in the computer vision domain. This is\ndue to the difficulty in implementing optimal feature extraction methods to\ncope with the subtlety and brief motion characteristics of the expression. Most\nof the existing approaches extract the subtle facial movements based on\nhand-crafted features. In this paper, we address the micro-expression\nrecognition task with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which\nwell integrates the features extracted from each video. A new feature\ndescriptor, Optical Flow Features from Apex frame Network (OFF-ApexNet) is\nintroduced. This feature descriptor combines the optical ow guided context with\nthe CNN. Firstly, we obtain the location of the apex frame from each video\nsequence as it portrays the highest intensity of facial motion among all\nframes. Then, the optical ow information are attained from the apex frame and a\nreference frame (i.e., onset frame). Finally, the optical flow features are fed\ninto a pre-designed CNN model for further feature enhancement as well as to\ncarry out the expression classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nOFF-ApexNet, comprehensive evaluations are conducted on three public\nspontaneous micro-expression datasets (i.e., SMIC, CASME II and SAMM). The\npromising recognition result suggests that the proposed method can optimally\ndescribe the significant micro-expression details.

Many such deep neural networks exist today that can\neasily differentiate cats from dogs. One such model is the ResNeXt model that\nuses a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture for image classification. This\npaper aims at implementing and evaluating the ResNeXt model architecture on\nsubsets of the CIFAR-10 dataset. It also tweaks the original ResNeXt\nhyper-parameters such as cardinality, depth and base-width and compares the\nperformance of the modified model with the original. Analysis of the\nexperiments performed in this paper show that a slight decrease in depth or\nbase-width does not affect the performance of the model much leading to\ncomparable results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2018 20:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Previous GRIN acoustic lenses are mostly inherently\ntwo-dimensional designs that are difficult to be extended to all three\ndimensions. Besides, manually designing the spatially inhomogeneous structure\nis both time-consuming and error-prone. In this work, we proposed and\nnumerically verified an automated computer-aided design tool: GRadient Index\nPick-and-Place (GRIPP) algorithm, for generating three-dimensional GRIN\nacoustic wave controlling devices with scalable and 3D printable structures.\nThe algorithm receives as inputs a spatial distribution of refractive index and\na pre-defined library of gradient index unit cells, and outputs a 3D model of\nGRIN device that is ready to be 3D printed. The tool enables rapid design and\nrealization of a large variety of 3D GRIN acoustic devices, which can be useful\nin areas such as speaker system design, airborne ultrasonic sensing, as well as\ntherapeutic ultrasound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 12:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

Here WO3 nanostructures are expected\nto be attached mainly to the edges of graphene thus making the hybrid structure\nnot only highly porous but also capable of preventing graphene stacking and\ncreating numerous sites for the deposition of Pt nanoparticles. Comparison has\nbeen made to the analogous systems utilizing neither reduced graphene oxide nor\ntungsten oxide component. By over-coating the reduced-graphene-oxide support\nwith WO3 nanorods, the electrocatalytic activity of the system toward the\nreduction of oxygen in acid medium has been enhanced even at the low Pt loading\nof 30 microg cm-2. The RRDE data are consistent with decreased formation of\nhydrogen peroxide in the presence of WO3. Among important issues are such\nfeatures of the oxide as porosity, large population of hydroxyl groups, high\nBroensted acidity, as well as fast electron transfers coupled to unimpeded\nproton displacements. The conclusions are supported with mechanistic and\nkinetic studies involving double-potential-step chronocoulometry as an\nalternative diagnostic tool to rotating ring-disk voltammetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 07:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}
