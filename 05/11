We\nintroduce the robustness of coherence of a quantum channel---which reduces to\nthe homonymous measure for states when computed on constant-output\nchannels---and prove that: i) it quantifies the minimal rank of a maximally\ncoherent state required to implement the channel; ii) its logarithm quantifies\nthe amortized cost of implementing the channel provided some coherence is\nrecovered at the output; iii) its logarithm also quantifies the zero-error\nasymptotic cost of implementation of many independent copies of a channel. We\nalso consider the generalized problem of imperfect implementation with\narbitrary resource states. Using the robustness of coherence, we find that in\ngeneral a quantum channel can be implemented without employing a maximally\ncoherent resource state. In fact, we prove that \\textit{every} pure coherent\nstate in dimension larger than $2$, however weakly so, turns out to be a\nvaluable resource to implement \\textit{some} coherent unitary channel.

In particular the\nPlancherel measure is a probability that arises naturally from representation\ntheory, and in this thesis we consider three ramifications of asymptotic\nquestions for random Plancherel distributed representations. First we recall\nirreducible characters of the symmetric group, which are indexed by integer\npartitions. We focus on the so called 'dual approach', in which the partition\nindexing a character is now considered to be the variable. We extend a famous\nresult of Kerov on the asymptotic of Plancherel distributed characters by\nstudying partial trace and partial sum of a representation matrix. We decompose\neach of these objects into a main term and a remainder, and in each case we\nprove a central limit theorem for the main term. We apply these results to\nprove a law of large numbers for the partial sum. In the second part we\nconsider projective representations of the symmetric group by converting a\nmultirectangular approach developed by Stanley for the classical case. In\nparticular, we present a positivity conjecture for the coefficients of the\nrenormalized projective character, written as a polynomial in a new set of\ncoordinates. We prove the positivity for the leading term of the polynomial. In\nthe last part of the thesis we recall the theory of supercharacters, which is\nan alternative tool to representation theory when the classical approach proves\nto be intractable. We show that a generalization of the Plancherel measure,\ncalled the superplancherel measure, arises naturally.

Given the rapid increase in the\nnumber and complexity of phylogenetic models, methods for approximating\nmarginal likelihoods are increasingly important.

This leads to failure\nin adapting it to sub-micron and nanotechnologies. The carbon nanotube (CNT)\ntechnology overcomes the threshold voltage and subthreshold leakage problems\ndespite reduction in size. The CNT based technology develops the most promising\ndevices among emerging technologies because it has most of the desired\nfeatures. Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs) are the novel\ndevices that are expected to sustain the transistor scalability while\nincreasing its performance.

We select galaxy members based on, e.g., parallax, PM,\ncolor-magnitude-diagram location, and local stellar density. The PM rotation of\nboth galaxies is confidently detected, consistent with the known line-of-sight\nrotation curves: $V_{\\rm rot} = -206\\pm86$ km s$^{-1}$ (counter-clockwise) for\nM31, and $V_{\\rm rot} = 80\\pm52$ km s$^{-1}$ (clockwise) for M33.

Our work aims to bridge this gap and\nproposes an efficient and effective direct prediction method based on ConvNets.\nCentral part to our approach is the incorporation of a parametric statistical\nbody shape model (SMPL) within our end-to-end framework. This allows us to get\nvery detailed 3D mesh results, while requiring estimation only of a small\nnumber of parameters, making it friendly for direct network prediction.\nInterestingly, we demonstrate that these parameters can be predicted reliably\nonly from 2D keypoints and masks.

Simultaneously, by\nmaintaining differentiability, at training time we generate the 3D mesh from\nthe estimated parameters and optimize explicitly for the surface using a 3D\nper-vertex loss. Finally, a differentiable renderer is employed to project the\n3D mesh to the image, which enables further refinement of the network, by\noptimizing for the consistency of the projection with 2D annotations (i.e., 2D\nkeypoints or masks). The proposed approach outperforms previous baselines on\nthis task and offers an attractive solution for direct prediction of 3D shape\nfrom a single color image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 17:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

The replicated databases scenario was considered by Sun and Jafar,\n2016, where $N$ databases can store the same $K$ messages completely. A PIR\nscheme was developed to achieve the optimal download cost given by $\\left(1+\n\\frac{1}{N}+ \\frac{1}{N^{2}}+ \\cdots + \\frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\\right)$. In this work,\nwe consider the problem of PIR from storage constrained databases. Each\ndatabase has a storage capacity of $\\mu KL$ bits, where $L$ is the size of each\nmessage in bits, and $\\mu \\in [1/N, 1]$ is the normalized storage. On one\nextreme, $\\mu=1$ is the replicated databases case.

We aim to characterize the optimal download cost versus storage\ntrade-off for any storage capacity in the range $\\mu \\in [1/N, 1]$.

A\ntwofold interpolation method is realized which implements both, the density\ndependence of a confining bag pressure at the onset of the hadron-to-quark\nmatter transition as well as the stiffening of quark matter at higher densities\nby a density-dependent vector meson coupling.

A critical review of the literature\nfrom the 19th Century to the present shows this is factually incorrect. The\nliterature shows the term asteroid was broadly recognized as a subset of planet\nfor 150 years. On-going discovery of asteroids resulted in a de facto\nstretching of the concept of planet to include the ever-smaller bodies.\nScientists found utility in this taxonomic identification as it provided\ncategories needed to argue for the leading hypothesis of planet formation,\nLaplace's nebular hypothesis. In the 1950s, developments in planet formation\ntheory found it no longer useful to maintain taxonomic identification between\nasteroids and planets, Ceres being the primary exception. At approximately the\nsame time, there was a flood of publications on the geophysical nature of\nasteroids showing them to be geophysically different than the large planets.\nThis is when the terminology in asteroid publications calling them planets\nabruptly plunged from a high level of usage where it had hovered during the\nperiod 1801 - 1957 to a low level that held constant thereafter. This marks the\npoint where the community effectively formed consensus that asteroids should be\ntaxonomically distinct from planets. The evidence demonstrates this consensus\nformed on the basis of geophysical differences between asteroids and planets,\nnot the sharing of orbits. We suggest attempts to build consensus around\nplanetary taxonomy not rely on the non-scientific process of voting, but rather\nthrough precedent set in scientific literature and discourse, by which\nperspectives evolve with additional observations and information, just as they\ndid in the case of asteroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 18:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 23:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

All recent improvements on Path TSP crucially exploit a\nstructural property shown by An, Kleinberg, and Shmoys [Journal of the ACM,\n2015], namely that narrow cuts with respect to a Held-Karp solution form a\nchain. We significantly deviate from these approaches by showing the benefit of\ndealing with larger $s$-$t$ cuts, even though they are much less structured.\nMore precisely, we show that a variation of the dynamic programming idea\nrecently introduced by Traub and Vygen [SODA, 2018] is versatile enough to deal\nwith larger size cuts, by exploiting a seminal result of Karger on the number\nof near-minimum cuts. This avoids a recursive application of dynamic\nprogramming as used by Traub and Vygen, and leads to a considerably simpler\nalgorithm avoiding an additional error term in the approximation guarantee. We\nmatch the still unbeaten $1.5$-approximation guarantee of Christofides'\nalgorithm for TSP. Hence, any further progress on the approximability of Path\nTSP will also lead to an improvement for TSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 18:49:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2018 16:37:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2018 10:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

Most of existing\nmethods attempt to improve accuracy with sophisticated network design, while\npaying less attention on speed. In this paper, we propose a general framework\nfor text detection called Guided CNN to achieve the two goals simultaneously.\nThe proposed model consists of one guidance subnetwork, where a guidance mask\nis learned from the input image itself, and one primary text detector, where\nevery convolution and non-linear operation are conducted only in the guidance\nmask. On the one hand, the guidance subnetwork filters out non-text regions\ncoarsely, greatly reduces the computation complexity. On the other hand, the\nprimary text detector focuses on distinguishing between text and hard non-text\nregions and regressing text bounding boxes, achieves a better detection\naccuracy. A training strategy, called background-aware block-wise random\nsynthesis, is proposed to further boost up the performance.

Current systems like Tensorflow and MXNet focus on one\nspecific parallelization strategy, data parallelism, which requires large\ntraining batch sizes in order to scale. We cast the problem of finding the best\nparallelization strategy as the problem of finding the best tiling to partition\ntensors with the least overall communication. We propose an algorithm that can\nfind the optimal tiling. Our resulting parallelization solution is a hybrid of\ndata parallelism and model parallelism. We build the SoyBean system that\nperforms automatic parallelization. SoyBean automatically transforms a serial\ndataflow graph captured by an existing deep learning system frontend into a\nparallel dataflow graph based on the optimal tiling it has found.

In this paper, we\npresent a tactile-sensing based approach to this challenging problem of\ngrasping novel objects without prior knowledge of their location or physical\nproperties. Our key idea is to combine touch based object localization with\ntactile based re-grasping. To train our learning models, we created a\nlarge-scale grasping dataset, including more than 30 RGB frames and over 2.8\nmillion tactile samples from 7800 grasp interactions of 52 objects. To learn a\nrepresentation of tactile signals, we propose an unsupervised auto-encoding\nscheme, which shows a significant improvement of 4-9% over prior methods on a\nvariety of tactile perception tasks. Our system consists of two steps. First,\nour touch localization model sequentially 'touch-scans' the workspace and uses\na particle filter to aggregate beliefs from multiple hits of the target. It\noutputs an estimate of the object's location, from which an initial grasp is\nestablished. Next, our re-grasping model learns to progressively improve grasps\nwith tactile feedback based on the learned features. This network learns to\nestimate grasp stability and predict adjustment for the next grasp. Re-grasping\nthus is performed iteratively until our model identifies a stable grasp.\nFinally, we demonstrate extensive experimental results on grasping a large set\nof novel objects using tactile sensing alone. Furthermore, when applied on top\nof a vision-based policy, our re-grasping model significantly boosts the\noverall accuracy by 10.6%.

The introduction of the residual module at the\nconvolutional layer for residual learning makes the network structure sensitive\nto changes in the output, as to better adjust the weight of the generator. In\norder to reduce the number of parameters and calculations, using a small\nconvolution to halve the number of channels in the input signature before using\na large convolution kernel.

By verifying the method on the DRIVE and STARE\ndatasets, the segmentation accuracy rate is 96.08% and 97.71%, the sensitivity\nreaches 82.74% and 85.34% respectively, and the F-measure reaches 82.08% and\n85.02% respectively.

In realm of fuzzy system community, data\nstream is handled by algorithmic development of self-adaptive neurofuzzy\nsystems (SANFS) characterized by the single-pass learning mode and the open\nstructure property which enables effective handling of fast and rapidly\nchanging natures of data streams. The underlying bottleneck of SANFSs lies in\nits design principle which involves a high number of free parameters (rule\npremise and rule consequent) to be adapted in the training process.

While achieving impressive results, this strategy has two\nkey limitations. First, it ignores Program Aliasing: the fact that many\ndifferent programs may satisfy a given specification (especially with\nincomplete specifications such as a few input-output examples). By maximizing\nthe likelihood of only a single reference program, it penalizes many\nsemantically correct programs, which can adversely affect the synthesizer\nperformance.

To\nreduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches)\nfor their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to\nthe issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than\nvendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless\nand decentralized blockchain-based network in which nodes can host and deliver\nsecurity updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network.\nHowever, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the\nnetwork, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space,\nbandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndecentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes\nreferred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency\nfor delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a\nvendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that\ndeliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart\ncontracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart\ncontract promises compensation to any distributor that provides\nproof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was\ndelivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution\nby exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge\nContingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the\nneed for trust between the security update distributor and the security\nconsumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly\nincrease the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 09:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

In\nthis paper, we try to reduce this gap by studying the fine-grained image\nrecognition problem in a challenging few-shot learning setting, termed few-shot\nfine-grained recognition (FSFG). The task of FSFG requires the learning systems\nto build classifiers for novel fine-grained categories from few examples (only\none or less than five). To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end\ntrainable deep network which is inspired by the state-of-the-art fine-grained\nrecognition model and is tailored for the FSFG task.\n  Specifically, our network consists of a bilinear feature learning module and\na classifier mapping module: while the former encodes the discriminative\ninformation of an exemplar image into a feature vector, the latter maps the\nintermediate feature into the decision boundary of the novel category. The key\nnovelty of our model is a \"piecewise mappings\" function in the classifier\nmapping module, which generates the decision boundary via learning a set of\nmore attainable sub-classifiers in a more parameter-economic way. We learn the\nexemplar-to-classifier mapping based on an auxiliary dataset in a meta-learning\nfashion, which is expected to be able to generalize to novel categories.

Most of our knowledge on the stellar component of galaxies is based\non the analysis of distant systems and comes from integrated light data. It is\nimportant to test whether the results of the star formation histories (SFH)\nobtained with standard full-spectrum fitting methods are in agreement with\nthose obtained through colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting (usually\nconsidered the most reliable approach). Aims. We compare SFHs recovered from\nboth techniques in Leo~A, a Local Group dwarf galaxy whose majority of stars\nformed during the last 8 Gyrs. This complements our previous findings in a\nfield in the Large Magellanic Cloud bar, where star formation has been on-going\nsince early epochs though at varying rates. Methods. We have used GTC/OSIRIS in\nlong-slit mode to obtain a high-quality integrated light spectrum by scanning a\nselected region within Leo~A, for which a CMD reaching the old main mequence\nturn-off (oMSTO) is available from HST. We compared the SFH obtained from the\ntwo datasets, using state-of-art methods of integrated light ({\\tt STECKMAP})\nand resolved stellar population analysis. In the case of the CMD, we computed\nthe SFH both from a deep CMD (observed with HST/ACS), and from a shallower one\n(archival data from HST/WFPC2). Results. The agreement between the SFHs\nrecovered from the oMSTO CMD and from full spectrum fitting is remarkable,\nparticularly regarding the time evolution of the star formation rate. The\noverall extremely low metallicity of Leo~A is recovered up to the last 2 Gyrs,\nwhen some discrepancies appear.

We significantly refine that empirical model by removing spurious\nsolar-rotational effects and by including an additional term that captures\nlong-term variations. Our results show that long-term variability cannot be\nreconstructed from the short-term response of the spectral irradiance, which\ncautions the extension of solar proxy models to these timescales. In addition,\nwe find that the solar response is nonlinear in such a way that cannot be\ncorrected simply by applying a rescaling to sunspot area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 12:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

The present\nstudy focuses on the integrated impact of mixing processes induced by a\npropagative normal mode-1 over long term experiments in an idealised setup. The\ninternal wave dynamics and the evolution of the density profile are followed\nusing the light attenuation technique. Diagnostics of the turbulent diffusivity\n$K_{T}$ and background potential energy $BPE$ are provided. Mixing effects\nresult in a partially mixed layer colocated with the region of maximum shear\ninduced by the forcing normal mode. The maximum measured turbulent diffusivity\nis 250 times larger than the molecular value, showing that diapycnal mixing is\nlargely enhanced by small scale turbulent processes.

To evaluate the impact of the use of the app in these\ncourses, we captured the results on engaging girls in design and coding\nactivities. For this paper, the authors present the data of surveys during the\nsecond cycle of the project. With a focus on female teenagers, the results\nallow us to conclude that a suitable classroom setting is significantly more\nimportant for them than the coding tool itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 12:53:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 11:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

We study the consequences of crossing symmetry for the\nfour-point correlator of $\\sigma$ in a $1/N$ expansion, using analytic\nbootstrap techniques. To order $1/N$ we show that crossing symmetry fixes the\ncontribution from the tower of currents, providing an alternative derivation of\nwell-known results by Maldacena and Zhiboedov. When $\\sigma$ has twist $1$ its\nOPE receives a contribution from the exchange of $\\sigma$ itself with an\narbitrary coefficient, due to the existence of a marginal sextic coupling. We\ndevelop the machinery to determine the corrections to the OPE data of\ndouble-trace operators due to this, and to similar exchanges. This in turns\nallows us to fix completely the correlator up to three known truncated\nsolutions to crossing. We then proceed to study the problem to order $1/N^2$.\nWe find that crossing implies the appearance of odd-twist double-trace\noperators, and calculate their OPE coefficients in a large spin expansion.\nAlso, surprisingly, crossing at order $1/N^2$, implies non-trivial $O(1/N)$\nanomalous dimensions for even-twist double-trace operators, even though such\ncontributions do not appear in the four-point function at order $1/N$ (in the\ncase where there is no scalar exchange).

But for a new task, videos are often\nunlabeled and it is also time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate them.\nInstead of human annotation, we try to make use of existing fully labeled\nimages to help recognize those videos. However, due to the problem of domain\nshifts and heterogeneous feature representations, the performance of\nclassifiers trained on images may be dramatically degraded for video\nrecognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called\nHierarchical Generative Adversarial Networks (HiGAN), to enhance recognition in\nvideos (i.e., target domain) by transferring knowledge from images (i.e.,\nsource domain). The HiGAN model consists of a \\emph{low-level} conditional GAN\nand a \\emph{high-level} conditional GAN. By taking advantage of these two-level\nadversarial learning, our method is capable of learning a domain-invariant\nfeature representation of source images and target videos. Comprehensive\nexperiments on two challenging video recognition datasets (i.e. UCF101 and\nHMDB51) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared with\nthe existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 13:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

However, in many applications, different\nsets of color names are used for the accurate description of objects. Labeling\ndata to learn these domain-specific color names is an expensive and laborious\ntask. Therefore, in this article we aim to learn color names from weakly\nlabeled data. For this purpose, we add an attention branch to the color naming\nnetwork. The attention branch is used to modulate the pixel-wise color naming\npredictions of the network. In experiments, we illustrate that the attention\nbranch correctly identifies the relevant regions. Furthermore, we show that our\nmethod obtains state-of-the-art results for pixel-wise and image-wise\nclassification on the EBAY dataset and is able to learn color names for various\ndomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 13:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

Due to the reduced\nprecision of the p\\text{-values} or test statistics, the usual approach for\nfitting mixture models may not be feasible. We instead use a binned-data\ntechnique, which can be proved to consistently estimate the z\\text{-score}\ndistribution parameters under mild correlation assumptions, as is often the\ncase in neuroimaging data. A simulation study shows that our methodology is\ncompetitive when compared with popular alternatives, especially with data in\nthe presence of misspecification. We demonstrate the applicability of our\nmethodology in practice via a brain imaging study of mice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 13:40:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 07:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

In line with the Sensorimotor\nContingencies Theory, we make the fundamental assumption that the semantic\ncontent of sensory inputs at least partially stems from the way an agent can\nactively transform it. We illustrate our approach by formalizing how simple\nvisual features can induce invariants in a naive agent's sensorimotor\nexperience, and evaluate it on a simple simulated visual system. Without any a\npriori knowledge about the way its sensorimotor information is encoded, we show\nhow an agent can characterize the uniformity and edge-ness of the visual\nfeatures it interacts with.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 13:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

Fitting the data with templates from two different MC\nevent generators, PYTHIA and POWHEG, the charm and beauty cross sections at\nmidrapidity are extracted for the first time at this collision energy: ${\\rm\nd}\\sigma_{\\rm c\\bar{c}}/{\\rm\nd}y|_{y=0}=974\\pm138(\\rm{stat.})\\pm140(\\rm{syst.})~\\mu{\\rm b}$ and ${\\rm\nd}\\sigma_{\\rm b\\bar{b}}/{\\rm\nd}y|_{y=0}=79\\pm14(\\rm{stat.})\\pm11(\\rm{syst.})~\\mu{\\rm b}$ using PYTHIA\nsimulations and ${\\rm d}\\sigma_{\\rm c\\bar{c}}/{\\rm\nd}y|_{y=0}=1417\\pm184(\\rm{stat.})\\pm204(\\rm{syst.})~\\mu{\\rm b}$ and ${\\rm\nd}\\sigma_{\\rm b\\bar{b}}/{\\rm\nd}y|_{y=0}=48\\pm14(\\rm{stat.})\\pm7(\\rm{syst.})~\\mu{\\rm b}$ for POWHEG. These\nvalues, whose uncertainties are fully correlated between the two generators,\nare consistent with extrapolations from lower energies. The different results\nobtained with POWHEG and PYTHIA imply different kinematic correlations of the\nheavy-quark pairs in these two generators. Furthermore, comparisons of\ndielectron spectra in inelastic events and in events collected with a trigger\non high charged-particle multiplicities are presented in various $p_{\\rm T}$\nintervals. The differences are consistent with the already measured scaling of\nlight-hadron and open-charm production at high charged-particle multiplicity as\na function of $p_{\\rm T}$. Upper limits for the contribution of virtual direct\nphotons are extracted at 90% confidence level and found to be in agreement with\npQCD calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 14:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 09:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

This paper investigates the evolution\nof such discs if they are very massive, as may be the case if their progenitor\nwas a terrestrial planet, moon, or dwarf planet. Assuming the discs are\nphysically thin and flat, like Saturn's rings, their evolution is governed by\nPoynting-Robertson drag or viscous spreading, where the disc's effective\nviscosity is due to self-gravity wakes. For discs with masses >10^26 g, located\nin the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone, viscous spreading dominates\nthe evolution, and mass is transported both in- and outwards. When\noutwards-spreading material flows beyond the Roche limit, it coagulates into\nnew (minor) planets in a process analogous to the ongoing formation of moonlets\nat the outer edge of Saturn's rings. The newly formed bodies migrate outwards\nby exchanging angular momentum with the disc and coalesce into larger objects\nthrough mutual collisions. Eventually, the disc's Roche-limit overflow recycles\ntens of percent of the original disc mass; most ends up in a single large body\nnear 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the disc's outer edge. Hence, the recycling\nof a tidally disrupted super-Earth, for example, could yield an Earth-mass\nplanet on a ~10-h orbit, located in the habitable zone for 2-to-10-Gyr-old\nwhite dwarfs. The recycling process also creates a population of smaller bodies\njust outside the Roche limit, which may explain the minor planets recently\npostulated to orbit WD 1145+017.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 14:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

A Bell test requires\nspatially distributed entanglement, fast and high-efficiency detection and\nunpredictable measurement settings. Although technology can satisfy the first\ntwo of these requirements, the use of physical devices to choose settings in a\nBell test involves making assumptions about the physics that one aims to test.\nBell himself noted this weakness in using physical setting choices and argued\nthat human `free will' could be used rigorously to ensure unpredictability in\nBell tests. Here we report a set of local-realism tests using human choices,\nwhich avoids assumptions about predictability in physics. We recruited about\n100,000 human participants to play an online video game that incentivizes fast,\nsustained input of unpredictable selections and illustrates Bell-test\nmethodology. The participants generated 97,347,490 binary choices, which were\ndirected via a scalable web platform to 12 laboratories on five continents,\nwhere 13 experiments tested local realism using photons, single atoms, atomic\nensembles, and superconducting devices. Over a 12-hour period on 30 November\n2016, participants worldwide provided a sustained data flow of over 1,000 bits\nper second to the experiments, which used different human-generated data to\nchoose each measurement setting. The observed correlations strongly contradict\nlocal realism and other realistic positions in bipartite and tripartite\nscenarios. Project outcomes include closing the `freedom-of-choice loophole'\n(the possibility that the setting choices are influenced by `hidden variables'\nto correlate with the particle properties), the utilization of video-game\nmethods for rapid collection of human generated randomness, and the use of\nnetworking techniques for global participation in experimental science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 14:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 00:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 16:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

The formalism of High Energy Jets (HEJ) calculates the\ncorrections systematically enhanced for a large ratio of the centre-of-mass\nenergy to the transverse momentum of the observed jets. These effects are\nrelevant in the analysis of e.g. Higgs-boson production in association with\ndijets within the cuts devised to enhance the contribution from Vector Boson\nFusion (VBF).\n  HEJ obtains an all-order approximation, based on logarithmic corrections\nwhich are matched to fixed-order results in the cases where these can be\nreadily evaluated. In this paper we present an improved framework for the\nmatching utilised in HEJ, which for merging of tree-level results is\nmathematically equivalent to the one used so far. However, by starting from\nevents generated at fixed order and supplementing these with the all-order\nsummation, it is computationally simpler to obtain matching to calculations of\nhigh multiplicity.\n  We demonstrate that the impact of the higher-multiplicity matching on\npredictions is small for the gluon-fusion (GF) contribution of Higgs-boson\nproduction in association with dijets in the VBF-region, so perturbative\nstability against high-multiplicity matching has been achieved within HEJ.

During the period of this project (2015-2017), teachers were\nsupported to guide their pupils in the learning processes by constructing ideas\nand realizing them through game design. For this paper an analysis of submitted\nprograms according to their game design has been performed. In detail, the\nevaluation considered formal game elements, gaming structures, and used\ngraphics, as well as Pocket Code specific aspects. The programs analysis showed\ncommonly used design patterns by genders and suggests preferred game design\ncharacteristics of female teenagers. This analysis helps to build a more\ncreative and inclusive Game Development-Based Learning (GDBL) environment that\nprovides room for self-expression and inspires by building on intrinsic and\nextrinsic motivators by constructing personal experiences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 15:51:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 11:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 11:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-07"}

In both cases, significant hyperparameter tuning is often\nrequired to achieve good performance. Furthermore, when nonlinear function\napproximation is used, non-stationarity in the state representation can lead to\nlearning instability. A variety of techniques exist to combat this --- most\nnotably large experience replay buffers or the use of multiple parallel actors.\nThese techniques come at the cost of moving away from the online RL problem as\nit is traditionally formulated (i.e., a single agent learning online without\nmaintaining a large database of training examples). Meta-learning can\npotentially help with both these issues by tuning hyperparameters online and\nallowing the algorithm to more robustly adjust to non-stationarity in a\nproblem. This paper applies meta-gradient descent to derive a set of step-size\ntuning algorithms specifically for online RL control with eligibility traces.\nOur novel technique, Metatrace, makes use of an eligibility trace analogous to\nmethods like $TD(\\lambda)$. We explore tuning both a single scalar step-size\nand a separate step-size for each learned parameter.

In stark\ncontrast to the Camassa-Holm equations without any nonlocal effect, to our best\nknowledge, little has been known on the large time behavior and convergence for\nthe nonlocal equations under study. We first study the large time behavior of\nsolutions. We then discuss the relation between the equations under\nconsideration and the imcompressible Navier-Stokes equations with fractional\nLaplacian viscosity (INSF). The main difficulty to achieve them lies in the\nfractional Laplacian viscosity. Fortunately, by employing some properties of\nfractional Laplacian, in particular, the fractional Leibniz chain rule and the\nfractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev type estimates, the high and low\nfrequency splitting method and the Fourier splitting method, we first establish\nthe large time behavior concerning non-uniform decay and algebraic decay of\nsolutions to the nonlocal equations under study. In particular, under the\ncritical case $s=\\dfrac{n}{4}$, the nonlocal version of Ladyzhenskaya's\ninequality is skillfully used, and the smallness of initial data in several\nSobolev spaces is required to gain the non-uniform decay and algebraic decay.\nOn the other hand, by means of the fractional heat kernel estimates, we figure\nout the relation between the nonlocal equations under consideration and the\nequations (INSF). Specifically, we prove that the solution to the Camassa-Holm\nequations with nonlocal viscosity converges strongly as the filter parameter\n$\\alpha\\rightarrow~0$ to a solution of the equations (INSF).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 11:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

Next we determine the extent of the quark-hadron mixed phase and its\ncrystalline structure using the Glendenning construction, allowing for the\nformation of spherical blob, rod, and slab rare phase geometries. Finally we\ncalculate the neutrino emissivity due to electron-lattice interactions\nutilizing the formalism developed for the analogous process in neutron star\ncrusts.

While previous research has mostly targeted vehicular models in\nwhich vehicles are randomly distributed and the variable of carrier frequency\nwas not considered, a more realistic analysis of the V2X model is proposed in\nthis paper. We use a one-dimensional (1D) Poisson cluster process (PCP) to\nmodel a realistic scenario of vehicle distribution in a perpendicular cross\nline road urban area and compare the coverage results with the previous\nresearch that distributed vehicles randomly by Poisson Point Process (PPP).\nMoreover, we incorporate the effect of different carrier frequencies, mmWave\nand sub-6 GHz, to our analysis by altering the antenna radiation pattern\naccordingly. Results indicated that while the effect of clustering led to lower\noutage, using mmWave had even more significance in leading to lower outage.\nMoreover, line-of-sight (LoS) interference links are shown to be more dominant\nin lowering the outage than the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links even though they\nare less in number. The analytical results give insight into designing and\nanalyzing the urban V2X channels, and are verified by actual urban area\nthree-dimensional (3D) ray-tracing simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 02:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 02:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

The objective is to minimize the network-wide power\nconsumption of vehicular users (VUEs) while ensuring high reliability in terms\nof probabilistic queuing delays. In particular, a reliability measure is\ndefined to characterize extreme events (i.e., when vehicles' queue lengths\nexceed a predefined threshold with non-negligible probability) using extreme\nvalue theory (EVT). Leveraging principles from federated learning (FL), the\ndistribution of these extreme events corresponding to the tail distribution of\nqueues is estimated by VUEs in a decentralized manner. Finally, Lyapunov\noptimization is used to find the joint transmit power and resource allocation\npolicies for each VUE in a distributed manner. The proposed solution is\nvalidated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model. It is\nshown that FL enables the proposed distributed method to estimate the tail\ndistribution of queues with an accuracy that is very close to a centralized\nsolution with up to 79\\% reductions in the amount of data that need to be\nexchanged. Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60\\% reductions of\nVUEs with large queue lengths, without an additional power consumption,\ncompared to an average queue-based baseline. Compared to systems with fixed\npower consumption and focusing on queue stability while minimizing average\npower consumption, the reduction in extreme events of the proposed method is\nabout two orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 11:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

Although GANs are gaining prominence in various fields, there are no\naccelerators for these new models. In fact, GANs leverage a new operator,\ncalled transposed convolution, that exposes unique challenges for hardware\nacceleration. This operator first inserts zeros within the multidimensional\ninput, then convolves a kernel over this expanded array to add information to\nthe embedded zeros. Even though there is a convolution stage in this operator,\nthe inserted zeros lead to underutilization of the compute resources when a\nconventional convolution accelerator is employed. We propose the GANAX\narchitecture to alleviate the sources of inefficiency associated with the\nacceleration of GANs using conventional convolution accelerators, making the\nfirst GAN accelerator design possible. We propose a reorganization of the\noutput computations to allocate compute rows with similar patterns of zeros to\nadjacent processing engines, which also avoids inconsequential multiply-adds on\nthe zeros. This compulsory adjacency reclaims data reuse across these\nneighboring processing engines, which had otherwise diminished due to the\ninserted zeros. The reordering breaks the full SIMD execution model, which is\nprominent in convolution accelerators. Therefore, we propose a unified\nMIMD-SIMD design for GANAX that leverages repeated patterns in the computation\nto create distinct microprograms that execute concurrently in SIMD mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 22:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}
