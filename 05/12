To address this problem, we present the first approach, VeriCI, for\nstatically checking for errors in a given CI configuration before the developer\npushes a commit to build on the CI server.

However, collecting such annotated\ndatasets is challenging. We propose to complete existing databases by\ngenerating new database entries. The key idea is to synthesize data in the\nskeleton space (instead of doing so in the depth-map space) which enables an\neasy and intuitive way of manipulating data entries. Since the skeleton entries\ngenerated in this way do not have the corresponding depth map entries, we\nexploit them by training a separate hand pose generator (HPG) which synthesizes\nthe depth map from the skeleton entries. By training the HPG and HPE in a\nsingle unified optimization framework enforcing that 1) the HPE agrees with the\npaired depth and skeleton entries; and 2) the HPG-HPE combination satisfies the\ncyclic consistency (both the input and the output of HPG-HPE are skeletons)\nobserved via the newly generated unpaired skeletons, our algorithm constructs a\nHPE which is robust to variations that go beyond the coverage of the existing\ndatabase. Our training algorithm adopts the generative adversarial networks\n(GAN) training process. As a by-product, we obtain a hand pose discriminator\n(HPD) that is capable of picking out realistic hand poses.

We\nstudy in more detail such orbifold and orientifold actions preserving\nhalf-maximal supersymmetry, and show how the half-maximal structure of ExFT\npermits the inclusion of localised non-Abelian vector multiplets located at the\norbifold fixed points. This allows us to reproduce for the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nexample the expected modifications to the gauge transformations, Bianchi\nidentities and actions of the theories obtained from the single ExFT starting\npoint. We comment on the prospects of studying anomaly cancellation and more\ncomplicated, non-perturbative O-folds in the ExFT framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

These organisms not only face the challenge of rewiring their proteome\nevery 12 hours, but also the necessity of storing the fixed carbon in the form\nof glycogen to fuel processes during the night. In this manuscript, we extend\nthe framework developed by Hwa and coworkers (Scott et al., Science 330, 1099\n(2010)) for quantifying the relatinship between growth and proteome composition\nto circadian metabolism. We then apply this framework to investigate the\ncircadian metabolism of the cyanobacterium Cyanothece, which not only fixes\ncarbon during the day, but also nitrogen during the night, storing it in the\npolymer cyanophycin. Our analysis reveals that the need to store carbon and\nnitrogen tends to generate an extreme growth strategy, in which the cells\npredominantly grow during the day, as observed experimentally. This strategy\nmaximizes the growth rate over 24 hours, and can be quantitatively understood\nby the bacterial growth laws. Our analysis also shows that the slow relaxation\nof the proteome, arising from the slow growth rate, puts a severe constraint on\nimplementing this optimal strategy. Yet, the capacity to estimate the time of\nthe day, enabled by the circadian clock, makes it possible to anticipate the\ndaily changes in the environment and mount a response ahead of time.

What eventually stops the\n(fast-rolling) relaxion field during its cosmological evolution is the\nproduction of particles whose mass is controlled by the Higgs vacuum\nexpectation value. We first show that Higgs particle production does not work\nfor that purpose as the Higgs field does not track the minimum of its potential\nin the regime where Higgs particles get efficiently produced through their\ncoupling to the relaxion. We then focus on gauge boson production. We provide a\ndetailed analysis of the scanning and stopping mechanism and determine the\nparameter space for which the relaxion mechanism can take place after\ninflation, while being compatible with cosmological constraints, such as the\nrelaxion dark matter overabundance and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We find that\nthe cutoff scale can be as high as two hundreds of TeV. In this approach, the\nrelaxion sector is responsible for reheating the visible sector. The stopping\nbarriers of the periodic potential are large and Higgs-independent,\nfacilitating model-building. The allowed relaxion mass ranges from 200 MeV up\nto the weak scale. In this scenario, the relaxion field excursion is\nsubplanckian, and is thus many orders of magnitude smaller than in the original\nrelaxion proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 18:19:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 16:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 16:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Both values appear to be closely\nrelated with the stellar rotation period, as they might be created by changing\nvisibility of a hot-spot formed near the magnetic pole directed towards the\nobserver. These major light variations were superimposed on a chaotic,\nflaring-type activity caused by hot-spots resulting from unstable accretion - a\nsituation reminiscent of that in 2011, when TW Hya showed signs of a moderately\nstable accretion state. In 2015 only drifting quasi-periods were observed,\nsimilar to those present in 2008-2009 data and typical for magnetised stars\naccreting in a strongly unstable regime. A rich set of multi-colour data was\nobtained during 2013-2017 with the primary aim to characterize the basic\nspectral properties of the mysterious occultations in TW Hya.

Assuming a simple isothermal\nand flat density distribution of intercluster gas over superclusters, the\nestimated baryon density is (Omega_gas / Omega_b) * (T_e/(8*10^6 K)) = 0.067 +-\n0.006 +- 0.025. This quantity is inversely proportional to the temperature,\ntherefore taking values from simulations and observations, we find that the gas\ndensity in superclusters may account for 17 - 52 % of missing baryons at low\nredshifts. A better understanding of the physical state of gas in the\nsuperclusters is required to accurately estimate the contribution of our\nmeasurements to missing baryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 18:58:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 12:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

To overcome this limitation, we have created the\nWashington University- Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (WU-NEAT), containing two\nof the most commonly used tools, provided in an open-source,\nclinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first\nalgorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by\nfiltering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with\nsubsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge\nfrequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-\ndefined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was\nvalidated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings\nof fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a\nreference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm.

Popular approaches for comparing populations (on\nEuclidean domains) mostly involvea two-step procedure: (1) estimate probability\ndensity functions (pdfs) from their respective samples, most commonly using the\nkernel density estimator, and, (2) compare pdfs using a metric such as the L2\nnorm. However, both the estimated pdfs and their differences depend heavily on\nthe chosen kernels, bandwidths, and sample sizes. Here we develop a framework\nfor comparing spherical populations that is robust to these choices.\nEssentially, we characterize pdfs on spherical domains by quantifying their\nsmoothness. Our framework uses a spectral representation, with densities\nrepresented by their coefficients with respect to the eigenfunctions of the\nLaplacian operator on a sphere. The change in smoothness, akin to using\ndifferent kernel bandwidths, is controlled by exponential decays in coefficient\nvalues. Then we derive a proper distance for comparing pdf coefficients while\nequalizing smoothness levels, negating influences of sample size and bandwidth.\nThis signifies a fair and meaningful comparisons of populations, despite vastly\ndifferent sample sizes, and leads to a robust and improved performance.

Almost all the stars exhibit\nsegments of their light curve that contain either single or double dip segments\n(very few have more than two significant dips per rotation). We define a\nvariable, the \"single/double ratio\" (SDR) that expresses the ratio of the time\nspent in single mode to the time spent in double mode. Unexpectedly, there is a\nstrong relationship between the SDR and the stellar rotation period, in the\nsense that longer periods come with a larger fraction of double segments.

We also show that the relationships of spot variability\namplitude (R_var) to rotation period have similar levels of scatter, slopes,\nand dependence on temperature as the SDR-Period relations. Finally, the median\nR_var of single segments tends to be about twice that of double segments in a\ngiven light curve.

The materials with close densities and x-ray attenuations such as W and\nU were reliably separated and quantified based on their measured CT numbers.\nThe boundary conditions for the system design were determined including scan\ntime, radiation dose, maximum object thicknesses, and spatial resolution. Based\non the findings of this feasibility study, it is concluded that the MV cargo CT\nsystem with large field of view can be developed based on existing technology\nalready used in MV cargo radiography. Such a CT system can be extremely useful\nas adjunct to existing MV radiography on resolving the special cases that\ncannot be resolved conclusively with radiography alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2018 22:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

Namely, how do\nsampling strategies explore conformational space and how might this influence\npredictions? Here, we seek to answer these questions for four commonly used\nsampling methods: 1) a long simulation, 2) many short simulations, 3) adaptive\nsampling, and 4) FAST. We first develop a theoretical framework for\nanalytically calculating the probability of discovering states and uncover the\ndrastic effects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use\nkinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes\nto characterize state discovery and transition pathways. Consistently, we find\nthat FAST simulations discover target states with the highest probability and\ntraverse realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the pathology that short\nparallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by\ncrossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically\ncircumnavigate, which we refer to as pathway tunneling. To protect against\ntunneling, we introduce FAST-string, which samples along the highest-flux\ntransition paths to refine an MSMs transition probabilities and discriminate\nbetween competing pathways. Additionally, we compare MSM estimators in\ndescribing thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend\nnormalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding pseudo-counts\nto avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate our insights from\nsimple landscapes with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding\nof the {\\lambda}-repressor protein.

Inequality\nconstraints are very flexible because they do not assume exact prior knowledge.\nHowever, constrained Lagrangian dual optimization has been largely avoided in\ndeep networks, mainly for computational tractability reasons. To the best of\nour knowledge, the method of [Pathak et al., 2015] is the only prior work that\naddresses deep CNNs with linear constraints in weakly supervised segmentation.\nIt uses the constraints to synthesize fully-labeled training masks (proposals)\nfrom weak labels, mimicking full supervision and facilitating dual\noptimization. We propose to introduce a differentiable penalty, which enforces\ninequality constraints directly in the loss function, avoiding expensive\nLagrangian dual iterates and proposal generation. From constrained-optimization\nperspective, our simple penalty-based approach is not optimal as there is no\nguarantee that the constraints are satisfied. However, surprisingly, it yields\nsubstantially better results than the Lagrangian-based constrained CNNs in\n[Pathak et al., 2015], while reducing the computational demand for training. By\nannotating only a small fraction of the pixels, the proposed approach can reach\na level of segmentation performance that is comparable to full supervision on\nthree separate tasks.

We hypothesized that pinned fluxes have to\nbe picked out from the defect and move into an inside of a superconductor\nregardless free energy depth of the defect if the distance between fluxes\npinned at the defect is equal to the one of upper critical field. It is\nconsidered that the reason that this phenomenon has not been reported yet is\nthe flux jump of the volume defect dominating superconductor. The section means\nthat the fluxes that have penetrated into a inside of a superconductor in which\nvolume defects exist are preferentially pinned on them over the entire specimen\nbefore Ginzburg-Landau behavior. If the size of volume defects is uniform in\nsome extent, the influence of the planar and line defects is small and the flux\njump does not occur, we believe that the section must be observed in any\nsuperconductor. It is because this is one of the basic natures of pinning\nphenomenon in the volume defect dominating superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 May 2018 08:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 15:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

We initiate a systematic\nstudy of the computational complexity of this problem, depending on the number\nk of time-labels that every edge is allowed to have; that is, on the number k\nof time points where every edge can be present in the graph. To do so, we\ndistinguish between the decision version StarExp(k) asking whether a complete\nexploration of the instance exists, and the maximization version MaxStarExp(k)\nof the problem, asking for an exploration schedule of the greatest possible\nnumber of edges in the star.

In the recent past there\nhave been many attempts to solve the tension between direct measurements of\n$H_0$ and $\\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{0 {\\rm m}}}$ from the respective low redshift\nobservables and indirect measurements of these quantities from the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB). In this work we reconstruct a model independent\napproach that boils down to different classes of cosmological models under\nsuitable parameters choices. We test this parameterization against the latest\nPlanck CMB data combined with recent BAO, SNeIa datasets and the R16 direct\n$H_0$ measurements, and compare among different cosmological models. Our\nanalysis reveals that a strong positive correlation between $H_0$ and\n$\\sigma_8$ is more or less generic, irrespective of the choice of cosmological\nmodels. We also find that present data slightly prefers a phantom equation of\nstate for dark energy and a slight negative value for effective equation of\nstate for dark matter (which is a direct signature of interacting models) with\na relatively high value for $H_0$ consistent with R16 and simultaneously, a\nconsistent value for $\\Omega_{0 {\\rm m}}$. Thus, even though the tensions\ncannot be fully resolved, interacting models with phantom equation of state get\na slight edge over the others for currently available data. We also see that\nallowing interaction between dark energy and dark matter may resolve the\ntension between the high redshift CMB data and individual low redshift\ndatasets, but the low redshift datasets have inconsistencies between them (e.g.\nbetween BAO and $H_0$, SNeIa and BAO, and cluster counts and $H_0$) that are\npractically independent of the cosmological model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 May 2018 13:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 07:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

We measured the position and pair momentum\ndistribution of the superfluid during a breathing mode cycle for different\ninteraction strengths across the BEC-BCS crossover. Whereas the system exhibits\nself-similar evolution in the weakly interacting BEC and BCS limits, we found a\nviolation in the strongly interacting regime. The signature of scale-invariance\nbreaking is enhanced in the first-order coherence function. In particular, the\npower-law exponents that characterize long-range phase correlations in the\nsystem are modified due to this effect, indicating that the quantum anomaly has\na significant influence on the critical properties of 2D superfluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 May 2018 15:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}
