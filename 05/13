We show that the\nproblems of Fair Leader Election and Fair Coin Toss are equivalent, and focus\non Fair Leader Election.\n  Our main focus is on a directed asynchronous ring of $n$ processors, where we\ninvestigate the protocol proposed by Abraham et al.\n\\cite{abraham2013distributed} and studied in Afek et al.\n\\cite{afek2014distributed}. We show that in general the protocol is resilient\nonly to sub-linear size coalitions. Specifically, we show that\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n\\log n})$ randomly located processors or $\\Omega(\\sqrt[3]{n})$\nadversarially located processors can force any outcome. We complement this by\nshowing that the protocol is resilient to any adversarial coalition of size\n$O(\\sqrt[4]{n})$.\n  We propose a modification to the protocol, and show that it is resilient to\nevery coalition of size $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, by exhibiting both an attack and a\nresilience result. For every $k \\geq 1$, we define a family of graphs\n${\\mathcal{G}}_{k}$ that can be simulated by trees where each node in the tree\nsimulates at most $k$ processors. We show that for every graph in\n${\\mathcal{G}}_{k}$, there is no fair leader election protocol that is\nresilient to coalitions of size $k$.

Jupyter Notebooks are suitable as companion\napplications for Science Gateways, providing more flexibility and\npost-processing capability to the users. Moreover they are often used in\ntraining events and workshops to provide immediate access to a pre-configured\ninteractive computing environment. The Jupyter team released the JupyterHub web\napplication to provide a platform where multiple users can login and access a\nJupyter Notebook environment. When the number of users and memory requirements\nare low, it is easy to setup JupyterHub on a single server. However, setup\nbecomes more complicated when we need to serve Jupyter Notebooks at scale to\ntens or hundreds of users. In this paper we will present three strategies for\ndeploying JupyterHub at scale on XSEDE resources. All options share the\ndeployment of JupyterHub on a Virtual Machine on XSEDE Jetstream. In the first\nscenario, JupyterHub connects to a supercomputer and launches a single node job\non behalf of each user and proxies back the Notebook from the computing node\nback to the user's browser. In the second scenario, implemented in the context\nof a XSEDE consultation for the IRIS consortium for Seismology, we deploy\nDocker in Swarm mode to coordinate many XSEDE Jetstream virtual machines to\nprovide Notebooks with persistent storage and quota.

The goal of the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or\nequivalently, to minimize the expected regret.

The optimal\nregret of the dynamic assortment planning problem under the most basic and\npopular choice model---MNL model is still open.

Namely, using\nsimple properties of cones and Minkowski functionals, it is shown that the\nproblems can be usually reduced to the case when the cone is normal, even with\nthe respective norm being monotone. Thus, we offer a synthesis of the\nrespective fixed point problems arriving at the conclusion that they can be\nreduced to their standard metric counterparts.

By\nregarding the vectors as points forming a space, topological properties can be\nextracted by using the other data analysis technique called persistent\nhomology, and geometries by virtual diffusion processes over points.

Existing defenses leverage game theory or heuristics based on\ncorrelations between the public data and attributes. These defenses are not\npractical. Specifically, game-theoretic defenses require solving intractable\noptimization problems, while correlation-based defenses incur large utility\nloss of users' public data.\n  In this paper, we present AttriGuard, a practical defense against attribute\ninference attacks.

By introducing another\nrich language $Y$, we propose a novel triangular training architecture (TA-NMT)\nto leverage bilingual data $(Y,Z)$ (may be small) and $(X,Y)$ (can be rich) to\nimprove the translation performance of low-resource pairs. In this triangular\narchitecture, $Z$ is taken as the intermediate latent variable, and translation\nmodels of $Z$ are jointly optimized with a unified bidirectional EM algorithm\nunder the goal of maximizing the translation likelihood of $(X,Y)$. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that our method significantly improves the translation\nquality of rare languages on MultiUN and IWSLT2012 datasets, and achieves even\nbetter performance combining back-translation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 May 2018 03:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 04:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

In this model, based on the toroidal flux at\nthe base of the convection zone, bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) are produced\nwith statistical properties obtained from observed distributions. We find that\na little quenching in BMR tilt is sufficient to stabilize the dynamo growth.\nThe randomness and nonlinearity in the BMR emergences make the poloidal field\nunequal and cause some variability in the solar cycle. However, when observed\nscatter of BMR tilts around Joy's law with a standard deviation of $15^\\circ$,\nis considered, our model produces a variation in the solar cycle, including\nnorth-south asymmetry comparable to the observations. The morphology of\nmagnetic fields closely resembles observations, in particular the surface\nradial field possesses a more mixed polarity field. Observed scatter also\nproduces grand minima. In 11,650 years of simulation, 17 grand minima are\ndetected and $11\\%$ of its time the model remained in these grand minima. When\nwe double the tilt scatter, the model produces correct statistics of grand\nminima. Importantly, the dynamo continues even during grand minima with only a\nfew BMRs, without requiring any additional alpha effect. The reason for this is\nthe downward magnetic pumping which suppresses the diffusion of the magnetic\nflux across the surface. The magnetic pumping also helps to achieve 11-year\nmagnetic cycle using the observed BMR flux distribution, even at the high\ndiffusivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 May 2018 05:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

The _size\ncounting problem_ is that of calculating the exact number $n$ of agents in the\npopulation, assuming no leader (each agent starts in the same state). We give\nthe first protocol that solves this problem in sublinear time. The protocol\nconverges in $O(\\log n \\log \\log n)$ time and uses $O(n^{60})$ states ($O(1) +\n60 \\log n$ bits of memory per agent) with probability $1-O(\\frac{\\log \\log\nn}{n})$. The time complexity is also $O(\\log n \\log \\log n)$ in expectation.\nThe time to converge is also $O(\\log n \\log \\log n)$ in expectation. Crucially,\nunlike most published protocols with $\\omega(1)$ states, our protocol is\n_uniform_: it uses the same transition algorithm for any population size, so\ndoes not need an estimate of the population size to be embedded into the\nalgorithm. A sub-protocol is the first uniform sublinear-time leader election\npopulation protocol, taking $O(\\log n \\log \\log n)$ time and $O(n^{18})$\nstates.

A large body of work has\nbeen devoted to designing algorithms for the ad-hoc model, particularly for\nfundamental communications tasks such as broadcasting. Most of these\nalgorithms, however, assume that devices have some network knowledge (usually\nbounds on the number of nodes in the network $n$, and the diameter $D$), which\nmay not always be realistic in systems with weak devices or gradual deployment.\nVery little is known about what can be done when this information is not\navailable.\n  This is the issue we address in this work, by presenting the first\n\\emph{randomized} broadcasting algorithms for \\emph{blind} networks in which\nnodes have no prior knowledge whatsoever.

First, the\nnetwork topologies can be dynamic where agents may change their connections\nthrough rewiring during the course of interactions. Second, the game matrix\nbetween each pair of agents may not be static and usually not known as a prior.\nBoth the network dynamic and game uncertainty increase the coordination\ndifficulty among agents. In this paper, we consider a multiagent dynamic social\nlearning environment in which each agent can choose to rewire potential\npartners and interact with randomly chosen neighbors in each round. We propose\nan optimal rewiring strategy for agents to select most beneficial peers to\ninteract with for the purpose of maximizing the accumulated payoff in repeated\ninteractions.
