The\nuniqueness of our design is a sensor fusion scheme which integrates camera\nvideos, motion sensors (GPS/IMU), and a 3D semantic map in order to achieve\nrobustness and efficiency of the system. Specifically, we first have an initial\ncoarse camera pose obtained from consumer-grade GPS/IMU, based on which a label\nmap can be rendered from the 3D semantic map. Then, the rendered label map and\nthe RGB image are jointly fed into a pose CNN, yielding a corrected camera\npose. In addition, to incorporate temporal information, a multi-layer recurrent\nneural network (RNN) is further deployed improve the pose accuracy. Finally,\nbased on the pose from RNN, we render a new label map, which is fed together\nwith the RGB image into a segment CNN which produces per-pixel semantic label.\nIn order to validate our approach, we build a dataset with registered 3D point\nclouds and video camera images.

Finally, various ablation studies are\nperformed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Rowhammer exploits parasitic effects in\nDRAM to modify the content of a memory cell without accessing it. Instead,\nother memory locations are accessed at a high frequency. All Rowhammer attacks\nso far were local attacks, running either in a scripted language or native\ncode. In this paper, we present Nethammer.

A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of\nindividual brain data sets to a reference space. Previous work has not\nrigorously quantified the distortions in brain geometry from in-vivo to ex-vivo\nbrains due to the tissue processing, which will be important when computing\nproperties such as local cell and process densities at the voxel level in\ncreating reference brain maps. Further, existing approaches focus on\nregistering uni-modal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest\nin the marmoset model for neuroscience research, it is necessary to\ncross-register multi-modal data sets including MRIs and multiple histological\nseries that can help address individual variations in brain architecture. Here\nwe present a computational approach for same-subject multimodal MRI guided\nreconstruction of a histological series, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to\na reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during the different stages of\nhistological processing of the brains using the Jacobian determinant of the\ndiffeomorphic transformations involved.

When multiple devices seek to use such a facility\nsimultaneously, both the available computational resources and the available\ncommunication resources need to be appropriately allocated. In this manuscript,\nwe seek insight into the impact of the choice of the multiple access scheme by\ndeveloping solutions to the mobile energy minimization problem in the two-user\ncase with plentiful shared computational resources. In that setting, the\nallocation of communication resources is constrained by the latency constraints\nof the applications, the computational capabilities and the transmission power\nconstraints of the devices, and the achievable rate region of the chosen\nmultiple access scheme.

However, digitized neuroanatomical data sets\ncontaining labelled neurons, either individually or in groups labelled by\ntracer injections, do not fully fit into this classical framework. The\ntree-like shapes of neurons cannot mathematically be adequately described as\npoints in a vector space. There is therefore a need for new approaches. Methods\nfrom computational topology and geometry are naturally suited to the analysis\nof neuronal shapes. Here we introduce methods from Discrete Morse Theory to\nextract tree-skeletons of individual neurons from volumetric brain image data,\nor to summarize collections of neurons labelled by localized anterograde tracer\ninjections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is sensible to\nsummarize the collection of neurons labelled by a localized anterograde tracer\ninjection using a consensus tree-shape. The algorithmic procedure includes an\ninitial pre-processing step to extract a density field from the raw volumetric\nimage data, followed by initial skeleton extraction from the density field\nusing a discrete version of a 1-(un)stable manifold of the density field.\nHeuristically, if the density field is regarded as a mountainous landscape,\nthen the 1-(un)stable manifold follows the \"mountain ridges\" connecting the\nmaxima of the density field. We then simplify this skeleton-graph into a tree\nusing a shortest-path approach and methods derived from persistent homology.\nThe advantage of this approach is that it uses global information about the\ndensity field and is therefore robust to local fluctuations and non-uniformly\ndistributed input signals. To be able to handle large data sets, we use a\ndivide-and-conquer approach.

Adversarial samples are often crafted\nthrough adversarial perturbation, i.e., manipulating the original sample with\nminor modifications so that the DNN model labels the sample incorrectly. Given\nthat it is almost impossible to train perfect DNN, adversarial samples are\nshown to be easy to generate. As DNN are increasingly used in safety-critical\nsystems like autonomous cars, it is crucial to develop techniques for defending\nsuch attacks. Existing defense mechanisms which aim to make adversarial\nperturbation challenging have been shown to be ineffective. In this work, we\npropose an alternative approach. We first observe that adversarial samples are\nmuch more sensitive to perturbations than normal samples. That is, if we impose\nrandom perturbations on a normal and an adversarial sample respectively, there\nis a significant difference between the ratio of label change due to the\nperturbations. Observing this, we design a statistical adversary detection\nalgorithm called nMutant (inspired by mutation testing from software\nengineering community). Our experiments show that nMutant effectively detects\nmost of the adversarial samples generated by recently proposed attacking\nmethods. Furthermore, we provide an error bound with certain statistical\nsignificance along with the detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 04:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 08:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

A genetic polymorphism associated with population\npharmacokinetics (PK) is typically analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effect models\n(NLMM). Applying NLMM to large-scale data, such as those generated by\ngenome-wide studies, raises several issues related to the assumption of random\neffects, as follows: (i) Computation time: it takes a long time to compute the\nmarginal likelihood. (ii) Convergence of iterative calculation: an adaptive\nGauss-Hermite quadrature is generally used to estimate NLMM; however, iterative\ncalculations may not converge in complex models. (iii) Random-effects\nmisspecification leads to slightly inflated type-I error rates. As an\nalternative effective approach to resolving these issues, in this article we\npropose a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach for analyzing\npopulation PK data. In general, GEE analysis does not account for\ninter-individual variability in PK parameters; therefore, the usual GEE\nestimators cannot be interpreted straightforwardly, and their validities have\nnot been justified. Here, we propose valid inference methods for using GEE even\nunder conditions of inter-individual variability, and provide theoretical\njustifications of the proposed GEE estimators for population PK data. In\nnumerical evaluations by simulations, the proposed GEE approach exhibited high\ncomputational speed and stability relative to the NLMM approach. Furthermore,\nthe NLMM analysis was sensitive to the misspecification of the random-effects\ndistribution, and the proposed GEE inference is valid for any distributional\nform.

While a variety of qubit systems have shown high fidelities at the\none-qubit level, superconductor technologies have been the only solid-state\nqubits manufactured via standard lithographic techniques which have\ndemonstrated two-qubit fidelities near the fault-tolerant threshold.\nSilicon-based quantum dot qubits are also amenable to large-scale manufacture\nand can achieve high single-qubit gate fidelities (exceeding 99.9%) using\nisotopically enriched silicon. However, while two-qubit gates have been\ndemonstrated in silicon, it has not yet been possible to rigorously assess\ntheir fidelities using randomized benchmarking, since this requires sequences\nof significant numbers of qubit operations ($\\gtrsim 20$) to be completed with\nnon-vanishing fidelity. Here, for qubits encoded on the electron spin states of\ngate-defined quantum dots, we demonstrate Bell state tomography with fidelities\nranging from 80% to 89%, and two-qubit randomized benchmarking with an average\nClifford gate fidelity of 94.7% and average Controlled-ROT (CROT) fidelity of\n98.0%. These fidelities are found to be limited by the relatively slow gate\ntimes employed here compared with the decoherence times $T_2^*$ of the qubits.\nSilicon qubit designs employing fast gate operations based on high Rabi\nfrequencies, together with advanced pulsing techniques, should therefore enable\nsignificantly higher fidelities in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 07:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 14:21:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 01:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

While many useful features\nhave been discovered, the amount of features have grown to an extent that a\nfeature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of\ndimensionality.

This result\nextends the particle Gibbs samplers introduced by Andrieu-Doucet-Holenstein [2]\nin the context of discrete generation models to continuous time Feynman-Kac\nmodels and their interacting jump particle interpretations. We also provide new\npropagation of chaos estimates for continuous time genealogical tree based\nparticle models with respect to the time horizon and the size of the systems.\nThese results allow to obtain sharp quantitative estimates of the convergence\nrate to equilibrium of particle Gibbs-Glauber samplers. To the best of our\nknowledge these results are the first of this kind for continuous time\nFeynman-Kac measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 07:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 09:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 10:44:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 08:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

QKD\nconsists of two parts: quantum and classical. The latter is referred to as\nclassical post-processing (CPP). Information reconciliation is a part of CPP in\nwhich parties are given correlated variables and attempt to eliminate the\ndiscrepancies between them while disclosing a minimum amount of information.\nThe elegant reconciliation protocol known as \\emph{Cascade} was developed\nspecifically for QKD in 1992 and has become the de-facto standard for all QKD\nimplementations. However, the protocol is highly interactive. Thus, other\nprotocols based on linear block codes such as Hamming codes, low-density\nparity-check (LDPC) codes, and polar codes have been researched. In particular,\nreconciliation using LDPC codes has been mainly studied because of its\noutstanding performance. Nevertheless, with small block size, the bit error\nrate performance of polar codes under successive-cancellation list (SCL)\ndecoding with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is comparable to state-of-the-art\nturbo and LDPC codes. In this study, we demonstrate the use of polar codes to\nimprove the performance of information reconciliation in a QKD system with\nsmall block size. The best decoder for polar codes, a CRC-aided SCL decoder,\nrequires CRC-precoded messages. However, messages that are sifted keys in QKD\nare obtained arbitrarily as a result of a characteristic of the QKD protocol\nand cannot be CRC-precoded. We propose a method that allows arbitrarily\nobtained sifted keys to be CRC precoded by introducing a virtual string. Thus\nthe best decoder can be used for reconciliation using polar codes and improves\nthe efficiency of the protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 07:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

Despite the blooming of synchronization study in\na variety of disciplines, the original phenomenon described by Huygens remains\na puzzle to researchers. Here, by placing two mechanical metronomes on top of a\nfreely moving plastic board, we revisit the synchronization experiment\nconducted by Huygens. Experimental results show that by introducing a small\nmismatch to the natural frequencies of the metronomes, the probability for\ngenerating the anti-phase synchronization (APS) state, i.e., the \"odd sympathy\"\ndescribed by Huygens, can be clearly increased. By numerical simulations of the\nsystem dynamics, we conduct a detailed analysis on the influence of frequency\nmismatch on APS. It is found that as the frequency mismatch increases from $0$,\nthe attracting basin of APS is gradually enlarged and, in the meantime, the\nbasin of in-phase synchronization (IPS) is reduced. However, as the frequency\nmismatch exceeds some critical value, both the basins of APS and IPS are\nsuddenly disappeared, resulting in the desynchronization states. The impacts of\nfriction coefficient and synchronization precision on APS are also studied, and\nit is found that with the increases of the friction coefficient and the\nprecision requirement of APS, the critical frequency mismatch for\ndesynchronization will be decreased. Our study indicates that, instead of luck,\nHuygens might have introduced, deliberately and elaborately, a small frequency\nmismatch to the pendulums in his experiment for generating the \"odd sympathy\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 09:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

This contrasts traditional models\nwhere either the payment of continuous dividends is controlled or the dynamics\nare given by discrete time processes. Moreover, between two dividend payments,\nthe structure allows for other types of control; we consider the possibility of\nequity issuance at any point in time. The value is characterized as the fixed\npoint of an optimal control problem with periodic initial and terminal\nconditions. We prove the regularity and uniqueness of the corresponding dynamic\nprogramming equation, and the convergence of an efficient numerical algorithm\nthat we use to study the problem. The model enables us to find the loss caused\nby infrequent dividend payments.

Previous models based on event pairs or event\nchains cannot make full use of dense event connections, which may limit their\ncapability of event prediction. To remedy this, we propose constructing an\nevent graph to better utilize the event network information for script event\nprediction. In particular, we first extract narrative event chains from large\nquantities of news corpus, and then construct a narrative event evolutionary\ngraph (NEEG) based on the extracted chains. NEEG can be seen as a knowledge\nbase that describes event evolutionary principles and patterns. To solve the\ninference problem on NEEG, we present a scaled graph neural network (SGNN) to\nmodel event interactions and learn better event representations. Instead of\ncomputing the representations on the whole graph, SGNN processes only the\nconcerned nodes each time, which makes our model feasible to large-scale\ngraphs.

Our attack\nleverages the widely adopted user-blocking mechanism, abusing its inherent\nproperty that certain pages return different web content depending on whether a\nuser is blocked from another user. Our key insight is that an account prepared\nby an attacker can hold an attacker-controllable binary state of\nblocking/non-blocking with respect to an arbitrary user on the same service;\nprovided that the user is logged in to the service, this state can be retrieved\nas one-bit data through the conventional cross-site timing attack when a user\nvisits the attacker's website. We generalize and refer to such a property as\nvisibility control, which we consider as the fundamental assumption of our\nattack. Building on this primitive, we show that an attacker with a set of\ncontrolled accounts can gain a complete and flexible control over the data\nleaked through the side channel. Using this mechanism, we show that it is\npossible to design and implement a robust, large-scale user identification\nattack on a wide variety of social web services.

In a typical prophet or secretary problem, selection\ndecisions are assumed to be immediate and irrevocable. However, many online\nsettings accommodate some degree of revocability. To study such scenarios, we\nintroduce the $\\ell-out-of-k$ setting, where the decision maker can select up\nto $k$ elements immediately and irrevocably, but her performance is measured by\nthe top $\\ell$ elements in the selected set. Equivalently, the decision makes\ncan hold up to $\\ell$ elements at any given point in time, but can make up to\n$k-\\ell$ returns as new elements arrive.\n  We give upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of $\\ell$-out-of-$k$\nprophet and secretary scenarios. These include a single-sample prophet\nalgorithm that gives a competitive ratio of $1-\\ell\\cdot\ne^{-\\Theta\\left(\\frac{\\left(k-\\ell\\right)^2}{k}\\right)}$, which is\nasymptotically tight for $k-\\ell=\\Theta(\\ell)$.

However, DAS often results in\nlimited image resolution and contrast, which are governed by the center\nfrequency and the aperture size of the ultrasound transducer. A large number of\nelements leads to improved resolution but at the same time increases the data\nsize and the system cost due to the receive electronics required for each\nelement. Therefore, reducing the number of receiving channels while producing\nhigh quality images is of great importance. In this paper, we introduce a\nnonlinear beamformer called COnvolutional Beamforming Algorithm (COBA), which\nachieves significant improvement of lateral resolution and contrast. In\naddition, it can be implemented efficiently using the fast Fourier transform.\nBased on the COBA concept, we next present two sparse beamformers with closed\nform expressions for the sensor locations, which result in the same beam\npattern as DAS and COBA while using far fewer array elements. Optimization of\nthe number of elements shows that they require a minimal number of elements\nwhich is on the order of the square root of the number used by DAS. The\nperformance of the proposed methods is tested and validated using simulated\ndata, phantom scans and in vivo cardiac data. The results demonstrate that COBA\noutperforms DAS in terms of resolution and contrast and that the suggested\nbeamformers offer a sizable element reduction while generating images with an\nequivalent or improved quality in comparison to DAS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 10:36:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 11:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-06"}

In this case we can find solutions of the Dirac equation\nand we calculate exactly the radiation emission using first-order perturbation\ntheory. We compare the results obtained to that obtained via the semi-classical\nmethod of Baier and Katkov which includes quantum effects due to photon recoil\nin the radiation emission but ignores the quantum nature of the electron\nmotion. On the one hand, we confirm a prediction of the semi-classical method\nthat the emission spectrum should coincide with that in the case of a linearly\npolarized monochromatic wave.

In this way, we address\nquantitatively the problem of the limits of validity of the semi-classical\nmethod, which is known, generally speaking, to be applicable for large quantum\nnumbers.

Indeed, the compositional and structural dependence of their\ndissolution kinetics remains unexplored. In this work, we correlate the\ndissolution rates of aluminoborate glasses in acidic, neutral, and basic\nsolutions with the structural changes induced by varying the aluminum-to-boron\nratio. In detail, we investigate a total of seventeen magnesium, lithium, and\nsodium aluminoborate glasses with fixed modifier content of 25 mol%.

The lowest dissolution rate\nvalue is observed in Mg-aluminoborate glasses, as a consequence of the\nintermediate character of magnesium which can increase the network\ncross-linking. For basic solutions, the chemical durability is almost constant\nfor the different amount of alumina in the three series, likely because B2O3 is\nsusceptible to nucleophilic attack, which is favored in high-OH- solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 14:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

These systems process computational\nworkflows in a way that can be mathematically modeled by a fork-and-join\nqueueing network with blocking (FJQN/B). While engineering solutions have long\nbeen made to build and scale such systems, it is challenging to rigorously\ncharacterize their throughput performance at scale theoretically. What further\ncomplicates the study is the presence of heavy-tailed delays that have been\nwidely documented therein. To this end, we introduce two fundamental concepts\nfor networks of arbitrary topology (scaling dimension and extended metric\ndimension) and utilize an infinite sequence of growing FJQN/Bs to study the\nthroughput limit. The throughput is said to be scalable if the throughput limit\ninfimum of the sequence is strictly positive as the network size grows to\ninfinity. We investigate throughput scalability by focusing on heavy-tailed\nservice times that are regularly varying (with index $\\alpha>1$) and featuring\nthe network topology described by the two aforementioned dimensions. In\nparticular, we show that an infinite sequence of FJQN/Bs is throughput scalable\nif the extended metric dimension $<\\alpha-1$ and only if the scaling dimension\n$\\le\\alpha-1$. These theoretical results provide new insights on the\nscalability of a rich class of FJQN/Bs with various structures, including\ntandem, lattice, hexagon, pyramid, tree, and fractals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 14:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

We aim to start identifying the factors that determine\nthe chemical structure of protostellar regions, by studying and comparing\nlow-mass embedded systems in key molecular tracers. The cold and warm chemical\nstructures of two embedded Class 0 systems, IRAS16293 and VLA1623 are\ncharacterized through interferometric observations. DCO+, N2H+ and N2D+ are\nused to trace the spatial distribution and physics of the cold regions of the\nenvelope, while c-C3H2 and C2H from models of the chemistry are expected to\ntrace the warm (UV-irradiated) regions. Both sources show a number of striking\nsimilarities and differences. DCO+ consistently traces the cold material at the\ndisk-envelope interface, where gas and dust temperatures are lowered due to\ndisk shadowing. N2H+ and N2D+, also tracing cold gas, show low abundances\ntowards VLA1623, but for IRAS16293, the distribution of N2D+ is consistent with\nthe same chemical models that reproduce DCO+. c-C3H2 and C2H show different\nspatial distributions for the two systems.

The standard way\nof evaluating DL models is to examine their performance on a test dataset. The\nquality of the test dataset is of great importance to gain confidence of the\ntrained models. Using an inadequate test dataset, DL models that have achieved\nhigh test accuracy may still lack generality and robustness. In traditional\nsoftware testing, mutation testing is a well-established technique for quality\nevaluation of test suites, which analyzes to what extent a test suite detects\nthe injected faults. However, due to the fundamental difference between\ntraditional software and deep learning-based software, traditional mutation\ntesting techniques cannot be directly applied to DL systems. In this paper, we\npropose a mutation testing framework specialized for DL systems to measure the\nquality of test data. To do this, by sharing the same spirit of mutation\ntesting in traditional software, we first define a set of source-level mutation\noperators to inject faults to the source of DL (i.e., training data and\ntraining programs). Then we design a set of model-level mutation operators that\ndirectly inject faults into DL models without a training process. Eventually,\nthe quality of test data could be evaluated from the analysis on to what extent\nthe injected faults could be detected. The usefulness of the proposed mutation\ntesting techniques is demonstrated on two public datasets, namely MNIST and\nCIFAR-10, with three DL models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 14:57:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 22:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

This requires consideration of the C-odd part of the gluonic\ngeneralized transverse momentum dependent (GTMD) correlator of nucleons in the\nnucleus. The gluonic GTMD correlator is the Fourier transform of an off-forward\nhadronic matrix element containing gluonic field strength tensors that are\nconnected by gauge links. It is parametrized in terms of various gluon GTMD\ndistribution functions (GTMDs). We show (in a gauge invariant way) that for the\nrelevant dipole-type gauge link structure in the small-$x$ limit the GTMD\ncorrelator reduces to a generalized Wilson loop correlator. The Wilson loop\ncorrelator is parametrized in terms of a single function, implying that in the\nregion of small $x$ there is only one independent dipole-type GTMD, which can\nhave a C-odd part. We show that the odderon Wigner distribution, which is\nrelated to this C-odd dipole GTMD by a Fourier transform, generates odd\nharmonics in the two-particle azimuthal correlations in peripheral $pA$\ncollisions. We calculate the first odd harmonic $v_1$ for forward production\nwithin the color glass condensate framework in the limit of a large number of\ncolors. We find that nonzero odd harmonics are present without breaking the\nrotational symmetry of the nucleus, arising just from its inhomogeneity in the\nradial direction. Using a CGC model with a cubic action, we illustrate that\npercent level $v_1$ can arise from this C-odd mechanism. In contrast, we show\nthat only even harmonics arise in diffractive dijet production in\nultra-peripheral $pA$ collisions where this gluon dipole GTMD also appears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 15:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 20:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

One common assumption is that the\npolynomial hierarchy (PH) does not collapse, a stronger version of the\nstatement that P $\\neq$ NP, which leads to the conclusion that any classical\nsimulation of certain families of quantum circuits requires time scaling worse\nthan any polynomial in the size of the circuits. However, the asymptotic nature\nof this conclusion prevents us from calculating exactly how many qubits these\nquantum circuits must have for their classical simulation to be intractable on\nmodern classical supercomputers. We refine these quantum computational\nsupremacy arguments and perform such a calculation by imposing fine-grained\nversions of the non-collapse assumption. Each version is parameterized by a\nconstant $a$ and asserts that certain specific computational problems with\ninput size $n$ require $2^{an}$ time steps to be solved by a non-deterministic\nalgorithm.

In\nmost of the cases, there may be no one order for the de Bruijn graph that works\nwell for assembling all of the reads. For this reason, some de Bruijn-based\nassemblers try assembling on several graphs of increasing order, in turn.\nBoucher et al. (2015) went further and gave a representation making it possible\nto navigate in the graph and change order on the fly, up to a maximum $K$, but\nthey can use up to $\\lg K$ extra bits per edge because they use an LCP array.\nIn this paper, we replace the LCP array by a succinct representation of that\narray's Cartesian tree, which takes only 2 extra bits per edge and still lets\nus support interesting navigation operations efficiently. These operations are\nnot enough to let us easily extract unitigs and only unitigs from the graph but\nthey do let us extract a set of safe strings that contains all unitigs. Suppose\nwe are navigating in a variable-order de Bruijn graph representation, following\nthese rules: if there are no outgoing edges then we reduce the order, hoping\none appears; if there is exactly one outgoing edge then we take it (increasing\nthe current order, up to $K$); if there are two or more outgoing edges then we\nstop. Then we traverse a (variable-order) path such that we cross edges only\nwhen we have no choice or, equivalently, we generate a string appending\ncharacters only when we have no choice. It follows that the strings we extract\nare safe. Our experiments show we extract a set of strings more informative\nthan the unitigs, while using a reasonable amount of memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 15:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-15"}

The analysis aims to\ninvestigate effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking in such systems.\nStationary one-dimensional modes are constructed in an implicit analytical\nform. These solutions include symmetric ones, as well as modes with\nspontaneously broken inter-core and along-the-cores symmetries.

Although the inductive approach\nhas not been effective in developing medical treatments, it has amassed enough\ninformation to allow construction of quantitative, deductive models of acute\ncell injury. In this work we develop a modeling approach by extending an\nautonomous nonlinear dynamic theory of acute cell injury that offered new ways\nto conceptualize cell injury but possessed limitations that decrease its\neffectiveness. Here we study the global dynamics of the cell injury theory\nusing a nonautonomous formulation. Different from the standard scenario in\nnonlinear dynamics that is determined by the steady state and fixed points of\nthe model equations, in this nonautonomous model with a trivial fixed point,\nthe system property is dominated by the transient states and the corresponding\ndynamic processes. The model gives rise to four qualitative types of dynamical\npatterns that can be mapped to the behavior of cells after clinical acute\ninjuries. The nonautonomous theory predicts the existence of a latent stress\nresponse capacity (LSRC) possessed by injured cells. The LSRC provides a\ntheoretical explanation of how therapies, such as hypothermia, can prevent cell\ndeath after lethal injuries. The nonautonomous theory of acute cell injury\nprovides an improved quantitative framework for understanding cell death and\nrecovery and lays a foundation for developing effective therapeutics for acute\ninjury.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 15:51:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 23:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

It\nproduced four X class flares, more than 20 CMEs and an intense geomagnetic\nstorm, for which the peak value of the Dst index reached up to -142nT at 2017\nSeptember 8 02:00 UT. In this work, we check the interplanetary and solar\nsource of this intense geomagnetic storm. We find that this geomagnetic storm\nwas mainly caused by a shock-ICME complex structure, which was formed by a\nshock driven by the 2017 September 6 CME propagating into a previous ICME which\nwas the interplanetary counterpart of the 2017 September 4 CME. To better\nunderstand the role of this structure, we conduct the quantitative analysis\nabout the enhancement of ICME's geoeffectiveness induced by the shock\ncompression. The analysis shows that the shock compression enhanced the\nintensity of this geomagnetic storm by a factor of two. Without shock\ncompression, there would be only a moderate geomagnetic storm with a peak Dst\nvalue of -79 nT. In addition, the analysis of the proton flux signature inside\nthe shock-ICME complex structure shows that this structure also enhanced the\nsolar energetic particles (SEPs) intensity by a factor of ~ 5. These findings\nillustrate that the shock-ICME complex structure is a very important factor in\nsolar physics study and space weather forecast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 03:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

This suppression\nof transfer and its removal suggests that it is important to consider carefully\nthe non-perturbative and cooperative effects of system-bath environments in\ndesigning artificial photosynthetic systems, and also that manipulating\ninter-environmental interactions could provide a new multidimensional \"lever\"\nby which to optimize photocells and other types of quantum device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 01:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

The method ensures high information\ncapacity of associative memory, i.e. a large number of synchronous states\n$N_s$. Each state in the system is characterized by the synchronization order\ndetermined as the ratio of harmonics number at the common synchronization\nfrequency. The modelling demonstrates attainment of $N_s$ of several orders\nboth for a three-oscillator scheme $N_s$~650 and for a two-oscillator scheme\n$N_s$~260. A number of regularities are obtained, in particular, an optimal\nstrength of oscillator coupling is revealed when $N_s$ has a maximum. A general\ntendency toward information capacity decrease is shown when the coupling\nstrength and switch inner noise amplitude increase. An algorithm of pattern\nstorage and test vector recognition is suggested. It is also shown that the\ncoordinate number in each vector should be one less than the switch number to\nreduce recognition ambiguity. The demonstrated method of associative memory\nrealization is a general one and it may be applied in ONNs with various\nmechanisms and oscillator coupling topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 13:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

However, since the\ndatacenters are deployed in concentrated and far remote areas, it fails to\nguarantee the quality of experience (QoE) attributes for the SG services, viz.\nlatency, bandwidth, energy consumption, and network cost. Fog Computing (FC)\nextends the processing capabilities into the edge of the network, offering\nlocation-awareness, low latency, and latency-sensitive analytics for mission\ncritical requirements of SG. In this work, we first examine the current state\nof cloud based SG architectures and highlight the motivation(s) for adopting FC\nas technology enabler for sustainable and real-time SG analytics. Then we\npresent a hierarchical FC architecture for supporting integration of massive\nnumber of IoT devices into future SG. Following this architecture we proposed a\ncost optimization framework that jointly investigates data consumer\nassociation, workload distribution, virtual machine placement and QoS\nconstraints towards viable deployment of FC model over SG networks. The\nformulated MINLP problem is then solved using Modified Differential Evolution\n(MDE) algorithm. Comprehensive evaluation of proposed framework on real world\nparameters shows that for an infrastructure with nearly 50% applications\nrequesting real-time services, the overall service latency for fog computing\nget reduced to almost half of that of generic cloud paradigm.

In neuroscience, for example, there is a need for\nimplantable optical devices to optogenetically stimulate neurons across deep\nbrain regions with the speed and precision matching state-of-the-art recording\nprobes.
