We have investigated physical mechanisms\nresponsible for the spectral change in Mrk 1018 by analyzing archival spectral\nand imaging data. Two kinematically distinct broad-line components, blueshifted\nand redshifted components, are found from spectral decomposition. The velocity\noffset curve of the broad-line as a function of time shows a characteristic\npattern. An oscillating recoiled supermassive black hole (rSMBH) scenario is\nproposed to explain the observed velocity offset in broad emission lines. A\nBayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation is performed to derive the best\nfit orbital parameters, we find that the rSMBH has a highly eccentric orbit\nwith a period of $\\sim$29 years. The AGN activity traced by variation of broad\nH$\\beta$ emission line is found to increase and decrease rapidly at the start\nand end of the cycle, and peaked twice at the start and near the end of the\ncycle. Extinction at the start and end of the cycle (when its spectral type is\nType 1.9) is found to increase due to increased covering factor. Perturbations\nof the accretion disk caused by pericentric passage can reasonably explain the\nAGN activity and spectral change in Mrk 1018. Currently, the spectral type of\nMrk 1018 is Type 1.9, and we do not know if it will repeat a similar pattern of\nspectral change in the future, but if it does, then spectral type will turn to\nType 1 around mid 2020's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 16:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

According to the current AGN\nparadigm, the low black hole masses and high accretion rates of narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1) should make them unlikely to launch jets, and indeed\nthe vast majority ($\\sim 90\\%$) are very radio weak. The remainder, however,\ndisplay a wide range of radio power, from $\\simeq 10^{21}$- $10^{28}$ W/Hz. In\nthis review I discuss recent radio imaging surveys that suggest there are three\nmain classes of NLSy1, which cannot be easily distinguished by the standard\nradio-loudness parameter alone: (i) radio-weak NLSy1s without jets, (ii) mildly\nradio-loud NLSy1s that are a mixture of star-forming and jet-dominant AGN, and\n(iii) very radio loud NLSy1s with extreme properties similar to powerful\njet-dominated blazars. I present updated kinematics information from the MOJAVE\nsurvey on six of the latter sources (all detected in gamma-rays by Fermi),\nindicating high bulk Lorentz factors and small viewing angles in three cases.\nStudies with the JVLA have shown that the jets of radio loud NLSy1s are likely\nlower- power versions of classical radio galaxies, with typical lengths of less\nthan 10 kpc, although two very radio-loud NLSy1s have de-projected sizes of\nseveral hundred kpc.

The model contains both deterministic\nand stochastic elements, and provides a unified framework within which to view\nthe formation of brown dwarfs and stars resulting from an accretion process\nthat starts from extremely low mass seeds. It does not depend upon a top down\nscenario of collapsing (Jeans) masses or an initial lognormal or otherwise\nIMF-like distribution of seed masses. Like the modified lognormal power law\n(MLP) distribution, the DPL distribution has a power law at the high mass end,\nas a result of exponential growth of mass coupled with equally likely stopping\nof accretion at any time interval. Unlike the MLP, a power law decay also\nappears at the low mass end of the IMF. This feature is closely connected to\nthe accretion stopping probability rising from an initially low value up to a\nhigh value. This might be associated with physical effects of ejections\nsometimes (i.e., rarely) stopping accretion at early times followed by outflow\ndriven accretion stopping at later times, with the transition happening at a\ncritical time (therefore mass). Comparing the DPL to empirical data, the\ncritical mass is close to the substellar mass limit, suggesting that the onset\nof nuclear fusion plays an important role in the subsequent accretion history\nof a young stellar object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 16:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

The G4 solstice storm was the second\nbiggest (so far) geomagnetic storms of cycle 24.

We introduce a neural parser which treats alignments as latent\nvariables within a joint probabilistic model of concepts, relations and\nalignments. As exact inference requires marginalizing over alignments and is\ninfeasible, we use the variational auto-encoding framework and a continuous\nrelaxation of the discrete alignments.

We first show that deciding whether a graph state |G>\ncan be transformed into another graph state |G'> using LC+LPM+CC is\nNP-Complete, even if |G'> is restricted to be the GHZ-state. However, we also\nprovide efficient algorithms for two situations of practical interest:\n  1. |G> has Schmidt-rank width one and |G'> is a GHZ-state. The Schmidt-rank\nwidth is an entanglement measure of quantum states, meaning this algorithm is\nefficient if the original state has little entanglement. Our algorithm has\nruntime O(|V(G')||V(G)|^3), and is also efficient in practice even on small\ninstances as further showcased by a freely available software implementation.\n  2. |G> is in a certain class of states with unbounded Schmidt-rank width, and\n|G'> is a GHZ-state of a constant size.

Our observations show a continuum radius that is anti-correlated\nwith the visual lightcurve.

In Refregier & Amara (2014), a\ncalibration method based on forward modeling, called MCCL, was proposed. This\nrelies on fast image simulations (e.g., UFig; Berge et al. 2013) that capture\nthe key features of galaxy populations and measurement effects. The MCCL\napproach has been used in Herbel et al. (2017) to determine the redshift\ndistribution of cosmological galaxy samples and, in the process, the authors\nderived a model for the galaxy population mainly based on broad-band\nphotometry. Here, we test this model by forward modeling the 40 narrow-band\nphotometry given by the novel PAU Survey (PAUS). For this purpose, we apply the\nsame forced photometric pipeline on data and simulations using Source Extractor\n(Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The image simulation scheme performance is assessed at\nthe image and at the catalogues level. We find good agreement for the\ndistribution of pixel values, the magnitudes, in the magnitude-size relation\nand the interband correlations. A principal component analysis is then\nperformed, in order to derive a global comparison of the narrow-band photometry\nbetween the data and the simulations.

We find good agreement, especially for the first three most significant\nPCs. We also compare the coefficients of the PCs decomposition. While there are\nslight differences for some coefficients, we find that the distributions are in\ngood agreement. Together, our results show that the galaxy population model\nderived from broad-band photometry is in good overall agreement with the PAUS\ndata. This offers good prospect for incorporating spectral information to the\ngalaxy model by adjusting it to the PAUS narrow-band data using forward\nmodeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Absorption lines from a variety of species are\nmeasured and compared to a stellar mass and impact parameter matched sample of\nsightlines through non-AGN galaxies. Amongst the observed species in the\nCOS-AGN sample (HI, CII, SiII, SiIII, CIV, SiIV, NV), only Ly$\\alpha$ shows a\nhigh covering fraction ($94^{+6}_{-23}$% for rest-frame equivalent widths EW $>\n124$ m\\AA) whilst many of the metal ions are not detected in individual\nsightlines. A sightline-by-sightline comparison between COS-AGN and the control\nsample yields no significant difference in EW distribution. However, stacked\nspectra of the COS-AGN and control samples show significant (> 3 sigma)\nenhancements in the EW of both Ly$\\alpha$ and SiIII at impact parameters $>\n164$ kpc by a factor of $+0.45\\pm0.05$ dex and $> +0.75$ dex respectively. The\nlack of detections of both high-ionization species near the AGN and strong\nkinematic offsets between the absorption systemic galaxy redshifts indicates\nthat neither the AGN's ionization nor its outflows are the origin of these\ndifferences. Instead, we suggest the observed differences could result from\neither AGN hosts residing in haloes with intrinsically distinct gas properties,\nor that their CGM has been affected by a previous event, such as a starburst,\nwhich may also have fuelled the nuclear activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 16:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

The presence of dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM)\ndramatically changes the metal abundances that we measure. Understanding the\nmetal content in the neutral ISM, and a direct comparison between different\nenvironments, has been hampered to date because of the degeneracy to the\nobserved ISM abundances caused by the effects of metallicity, the presence of\ndust, and nucleosynthesis. Aims. We study the metal and dust content in the\nneutral ISM consistently in different environments, and assess the universality\nof recently discovered sequences of relative abundances. We also intend to\nassess the validity of [Zn/Fe] as a tracer of dust in the ISM. This has\nrecently been cast into doubt based on observations of stellar abundances, and\nneeds to be addressed before we can safely use it to study the ISM. Methods. In\nthis letter we present a simple comparison of relative abundances observed in\nthe neutral ISM in the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and damped Lyman-{\\alpha}\nAbsorbers (DLAs). The main novelty in this comparison is the inclusion of the\nMagellanic Clouds. Results. The same sequences of relative abundances are valid\nfor the Galaxy, Magellanic Clouds, and DLAs. These sequences are driven by the\npresence of dust in the ISM and seem 'universal'. Conclusions. The metal and\ndust properties in the neutral ISM appear to follow a similar behaviour in\ndifferent environments. This suggests that a dominant fraction of the dust\nbudget is built up from grain growth in the ISM depending of the physical\nconditions and regardless of the star formation history of the system. In\naddition, the DLA gas behaves like the neutral ISM, at least from a chemical\npoint of view. Finally, despite the deviations in [Zn/Fe] observed in stellar\nabundances, [Zn/Fe] is a robust dust tracer in the ISM of different\nenvironments, from the Galaxy to DLAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 18:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Operator growth is a manifestation of information scrambling and can\nbe diagnosed by out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). However, the behavior of\nOTOCs of local operators in generic chaotic local Hamiltonians remains poorly\nunderstood, with some semiclassical and large N models exhibiting exponential\ngrowth of OTOCs and a sharp chaos wavefront and other random circuit models\nshowing a diffusively broadened wavefront.

This\nuncertainty can introduce significant systematics in the neutron star radius\nmeasurement using burst spectra, particularly if an unknown but significant\nfraction of the burst emission, which is reprocessed, contributes to the\nchanges in the persistent emission during the burst.

After computing Galactocentric space velocities for all the primary\nstars, we performed a kinematic analysis and classified them in different\nGalactic populations and stellar kinematic groups of very different ages, which\nmatch our own metallicity determinations and isochronal age estimations. In\nparticular, we identified three systems in the halo and 33 systems in the young\nLocal Association, Ursa Major and Castor moving groups, and IC 2391 and Hyades\nSuperclusters. We finally studied the exoplanet-metallicity relation in our 193\nprimaries and made a list 13 M-dwarf companions with very high metallicity that\ncan be the targets of new dedicated exoplanet surveys. All in all, our dataset\nwill be of great help for future works on the accurate determination of\nmetallicity of M dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 19:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

The modifications to the jet fragmentation functions are\nquantified by dividing the measurements in Pb+Pb collisions by baseline\nmeasurements in $pp$ collisions. This ratio is studied as a function of the\ntransverse momentum of the jet, the jet rapidity, and the centrality of the\ncollision. In both collision systems, the jet fragmentation functions are\nmeasured for jets with transverse momentum between 126 GeV and 398 GeV and with\nan absolute value of jet rapidity less than 2.1. An enhancement of particles\ncarrying a small fraction of the jet momentum is observed, which increases with\ncentrality and with increasing jet transverse momentum.

Between these two enhancements of the fragmentation functions a\nsuppression of particles carrying an intermediate fraction of the jet momentum\nis observed in Pb+Pb collisions.

The rate of such accretion, $\\dot M_{\\rm\nacc}$, is important to constrain, and most modeling of this process relies on\nassuming an equilibrium between diffusive sedimentation and metal accretion\nsupplied to the WD's surface convective envelope. Building on earlier work of\nDeal and collaborators, we show that high $\\dot M_{\\rm acc}$ models with only\ndiffusive sedimentation are unstable to thermohaline mixing and that models\nwhich account for the enhanced mixing from the active thermohaline instability\nrequire larger accretion rates, sometimes reaching $\\dot M_{\\rm acc} \\approx\n10^{13} \\, \\rm g \\, s^{-1}$ to explain observed Calcium abundances.

Here we present a\nsimple mechanism allowing ncRNA to perform computations equivalent to neural\nnetwork algorithms such as Boltzmann machines and the Hopfield model. The\nquantities analogous to the neural couplings are the equilibrium constants\nbetween different RNA species. The relatively rapid equilibration of RNA\nbinding and unbinding is regulated by a slower process that degrades and\ncreates new RNA. The model requires that the creation rate for each species be\nan increasing function of the ratio of total to unbound RNA. Similar mechanisms\nhave already been found to exist experimentally for ncRNA regulation. With the\noverall concentration of RNA regulated, equilibrium constants can be chosen to\nstore many different patterns, or many different input-output relations.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel variant of the interval scheduling problem,\nwhose definition is as follows: given jobs are specified by their {\\em release\ntimes}, {\\em deadlines} and {\\em profits}. An algorithm must start a job at its\nrelease time on one of $m$ identical machines, and continue processing until\nits deadline on the machine to complete the job. All the jobs must be completed\nand the algorithm can obtain the profit of a completed job as a user's\nsatisfaction. It is possible to process more than one job at a time on one\nmachine. The profit of a job is distributed uniformly between its release time\nand deadline, that is its interval, and the profit gained from a subinterval of\na job decreases in reverse proportion to the number of jobs whose intervals\nintersect with the subinterval on the same machine. The objective of our\nvariant is to maximize the total profit of completed jobs. This formulation is\nnaturally motivated by best-effort requests and responses to them, which appear\nin many situations. In best-effort requests and responses, the total amount of\navailable resources for users is always invariant and the resources are equally\nshared with every user. We study online algorithms for this problem.\nSpecifically, we show that for the case where the profits of jobs are\narbitrary, there does not exist an algorithm whose competitive ratio is\nbounded. Then, we consider the case in which the profit of each job is equal to\nits length, that is, the time interval between its release time and deadline.\nFor this case, we prove that for $m = 2$ and $m \\geq 3$, the competitive ratios\nof a greedy algorithm are at most $4/3$ and at most $3$, respectively. Also,\nfor each $m \\geq 2$, we show a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any\ndeterministic algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 20:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

We use\nPenman-Monteith, combined with semi-empirical optimal stomatal regulation\ntheory and underlying water use efficiency, to develop a theoretical framework\nfor assessing ET response to VPD. The theory suggests that depending on the\nenvironment and plant characteristics, ET response to increasing VPD can vary\nfrom strongly decreasing to increasing, highlighting the diversity of plant\nwater regulation strategies.\n  The ET response varies due to: 1) climate, with tropical and temperate\nclimates more likely to exhibit a positive ET response to increasing VPD than\nboreal and arctic climates; 2) photosynthesis strategy, with C3 plants more\nlikely to exhibit a positive ET response than C4 plants; and 3) plant type,\nwith crops more likely to exhibit a positive ET response, and shrubs and\ngymniosperm trees more likely to exhibit a negative ET response. These results,\nderived from previous literature connecting plant parameters to plant and\nclimate characteristics, highlight the utility of our simplified framework for\nunderstanding complex land atmosphere systems in terms of idealized scenarios\nin which ET responds to VPD only.

While most previous research was focused on analyzing mental state of users\nfrom social media and smartphones, there is little effort towards protecting\nuser privacy in these analyses. A challenge in analyzing user behaviors is that\nnot only is the data multi-dimensional with a myriad of user activities but\nthese activities occur at varying temporal rates. The overarching question of\nour work is: Given a set of sensitive user features, what is the minimum amount\nof information required to group users with similar behavior? Furthermore, does\nthis user behavior correlate with their mental state? Towards answering those\nquestions, our contributions are two fold: we introduce the concept of privacy\nsurfaces that combine sensitive user data at different levels of intrusiveness.\nAs our second contribution, we introduce MIMiS, an unsupervised privacy-aware\nframework that clusters users in a given privacy surface configuration to\nhomogeneous groups with respect to their temporal signature. In addition, we\nexplore the trade-off between intrusiveness and prediction accuracy. MIMiS\nemploys multi-set decomposition in order to deal with incompatible temporal\ngranularities in user activities. We extensively evaluate MIMiS on real data.\nAcross a variety of privacy surfaces, MIMiS identified groups that are highly\nhomogeneous with respect to self-reported mental health scores. Finally, we\nconduct an in-depth exploration of the discovered clusters, identifying groups\nwhose behavior is consistent with academic deadlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 21:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

SPHEREx\nwould carry out the first all-sky spectral survey in the near infrared. At the\nend of its two-year mission, SPHEREx would obtain 0.75-to-5$\\mu$m spectra of\nevery 6.2 arcsec pixel on the sky, with spectral resolution R>35 and a\n5-$\\sigma$ sensitivity AB$>$19 per spectral/spatial resolution element. More\ndetails concerning SPHEREx are available at http://spherex.caltech.edu. The\nSPHEREx team has proposed three specific science investigations to be carried\nout with this unique data set: cosmic inflation, interstellar and circumstellar\nices, and the extra-galactic background light. Though these three themes are\nundoubtedly compelling, they are far from exhausting the scientific output of\nSPHEREx. Indeed, SPHEREx would create a unique all-sky spectral database\nincluding spectra of very large numbers of astronomical and solar system\ntargets, including both extended and diffuse sources. These spectra would\nenable a wide variety of investigations, and the SPHEREx team is dedicated to\nmaking the data available to the community to enable these investigations,\nwhich we refer to as Legacy Science. To that end, we have sponsored two\nworkshops for the general scientific community to identify the most interesting\nLegacy Science themes and to ensure that the SPHEREx data products are\nresponsive to their needs. In February of 2016, some 50 scientists from all\nfields met in Pasadena to develop these themes and to understand their\nimplications for the SPHEREx mission. The 2016 workshop highlighted many\nsynergies between SPHEREx and other contemporaneous astronomical missions,\nfacilities, and databases. Consequently, in January 2018 we convened a second\nworkshop at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to focus specifically on\nthese synergies. This white paper reports on the results of the 2018 SPHEREx\nworkshop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 22:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 05:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

First, there is often a mismatch\nbetween how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are\nupdated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained\non past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work\nis focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even\nthough public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple\nevolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities\nare proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus\nlittle buy-in from the global public health and research community.

Developing software involves a mix of analytical and\ncreative work, and requires a significant load on brain functions, such as\nworking memory and decision making. Thus, task switching in the context of\nsoftware development imposes a cognitive load that causes software developers\nto lose focus and concentration while working thereby taking a toll on\nproductivity. To investigate the disruptiveness of task switching and\ninterruptions in software development projects, and to understand the reasons\nfor and perceptions of the disruptiveness of task switching we used a\nmixed-methods approach including a longitudinal data analysis on 4,910 recorded\ntasks of 17 professional software developers, and a survey of 132 software\ndevelopers. We found that, compared to task-specific factors (e.g. priority,\nlevel, and temporal stage), contextual factors such as interruption type (e.g.\nself/external), time of day, and task type and context are a more potent\ndeterminant of task switching disruptiveness in software development tasks.\nFurthermore, while most survey respondents believe external interruptions are\nmore disruptive than self-interruptions, the results of our retrospective\nanalysis reveals otherwise. We found that self-interruptions (i.e. voluntary\ntask switchings) are more disruptive than external interruptions and have a\nnegative effect on the performance of the interrupted tasks. Finally, we use\nthe results of both studies to provide a set of comparative vulnerability and\ninteraction patterns which can be used as a mean to guide decision-making and\nforecasting the consequences of task switching in software development teams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 00:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

On the other hand, the\nreal data is commonly streaming data, which requires to be processed online. In\nthese scenarios, the fashionable deep metric learning is not suitable anymore.\nTo this end, we reconsider the traditional shallow online metric learning and\nnewly develop an online progressive deep metric learning (ODML) framework to\nconstruct a metric-algorithm-based deep network. Specifically, we take an\nonline metric learning algorithm as a metric-algorithm-based layer (i.e.,\nmetric layer), followed by a nonlinear layer, and then stack these layers in a\nfashion similar to deep learning. Different from the shallow online metric\nlearning, which can only learn one metric space (feature transformation), the\nproposed ODML is able to learn multiple hierarchical metric spaces.\nFurthermore, in a progressively and nonlinearly learning way, ODML has a\nstronger learning ability than traditional shallow online metric learning in\nthe case of limited available training data. To make the learning process more\nexplainable and theoretically guaranteed, we also provide theoretical analysis.\nThe proposed ODML enjoys several nice properties and can indeed learn a metric\nprogressively and performs better on the benchmark datasets.

The\nflowchart is that, in order to optimize the target network (student), another\nnetwork (teacher) with the same architecture is first trained, and used to\nprovide part of supervision signals in the next stage. While this strategy\nleads to a higher accuracy, many aspects (e.g., why teacher-student\noptimization helps) still need further explorations.\n  This paper studies this problem from a perspective of controlling the\nstrictness in training the teacher network. Existing approaches mostly used a\nhard distribution (e.g., one-hot vectors) in training, leading to a strict\nteacher which itself has a high accuracy, but we argue that the teacher needs\nto be more tolerant, although this often implies a lower accuracy. The\nimplementation is very easy, with merely an extra loss term added to the\nteacher network, facilitating a few secondary classes to emerge and complement\nto the primary class. Consequently, the teacher provides a milder supervision\nsignal (a less peaked distribution), and makes it possible for the student to\nlearn from inter-class similarity and potentially lower the risk of\nover-fitting. Experiments are performed on standard image classification tasks\n(CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2012).

We demonstrate that this theory is built\non five identities, which follow from conservation of total charge (particle\nnumber), spin, and momentum in a translationally and $SU(2)$-invariant FL.\nThese identities allows one to express the effective mass and quasiparticle\nresidue in terms of an exact vertex function and also impose constraints on the\n\"quasiparticle\" and \"incoherent\" (or \"low-energ\" and \"high-energy\")\ncontributions to the observable quantities. Such constraints forbid certain\nPomeranchuk instabilities of a FL, e.g., towards phases with order parameters\nthat coincide with charge and spin currents. We provide diagrammatic\nderivations of these constraints and of the general (Leggett) formula for the\nsusceptibility in arbitrary angular momentum channel, and illustrate the\ngeneral relations through simple examples treated in the perturbation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 05:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

They are hence important for various\nfacial analysis tasks. Many facial landmark detection algorithms have been\ndeveloped to automatically detect those key points over the years, and in this\npaper, we perform an extensive review of them. We classify the facial landmark\ndetection algorithms into three major categories: holistic methods, Constrained\nLocal Model (CLM) methods, and the regression-based methods. They differ in the\nways to utilize the facial appearance and shape information. The holistic\nmethods explicitly build models to represent the global facial appearance and\nshape information. The CLMs explicitly leverage the global shape model but\nbuild the local appearance models. The regression-based methods implicitly\ncapture facial shape and appearance information. For algorithms within each\ncategory, we discuss their underlying theories as well as their differences. We\nalso compare their performances on both controlled and in the wild benchmark\ndatasets, under varying facial expressions, head poses, and occlusion. Based on\nthe evaluations, we point out their respective strengths and weaknesses. There\nis also a separate section to review the latest deep learning-based algorithms.\n  The survey also includes a listing of the benchmark databases and existing\nsoftware. Finally, we identify future research directions, including combining\nmethods in different categories to leverage their respective strengths to solve\nlandmark detection \"in-the-wild\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 05:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Acoustic landmarks are perceptually\nsalient, even in a language one doesn't speak, and it has been demonstrated\nthat non-speakers of the language can identify features such as the primary\narticulator of the landmark. These factors suggest a strategy for developing\nlanguage-independent automatic speech recognition: landmarks can potentially be\nlearned once from a suitably labeled corpus and rapidly applied to many other\nlanguages. This paper proposes enhancing the cross-lingual portability of a\nneural network by using landmarks as the secondary task in multi-task learning\n(MTL). The network is trained in a well-resourced source language with both\nphone and landmark labels (English), then adapted to an under-resourced target\nlanguage with only word labels (Iban). Landmark-tasked MTL reduces\nsource-language phone error rate by 2.9% relative, and reduces target-language\nword error rate by 1.9%-5.9% depending on the amount of target-language\ntraining data. These results suggest that landmark-tasked MTL causes the DNN to\nlearn hidden-node features that are useful for cross-lingual adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 05:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

The model allows for each processor to fault with bounded\nprobability, and possibly restart. On faulting all processor state and local\nephemeral memory are lost, but the persistent memory remains. This model is\nmotivated by upcoming non-volatile memories that are as fast as existing random\naccess memory, are accessible at the granularity of cache lines, and have the\ncapability of surviving power outages. It is further motivated by the\nobservation that in large parallel systems, failure of processors and their\ncaches is not unusual.\n  Within the model we develop a framework for developing locality efficient\nparallel algorithms that are resilient to failures. There are several\nchallenges, including the need to recover from failures, the desire to do this\nin an asynchronous setting (i.e., not blocking other processors when one\nfails), and the need for synchronization primitives that are robust to\nfailures. We describe approaches to solve these challenges based on breaking\ncomputations into what we call capsules, which have certain properties, and\ndeveloping a work-stealing scheduler that functions properly within the context\nof failures.

We have analysed in situ ion and magnetic\nfield data and combined this with hybrid modeling of the interaction between\nthe solar wind and the comet atmosphere. Results. The solar wind deflection is\nincreasing with decreasing heliocentric distances, and exhibits very little\ndeceleration. This is seen both in observations and in modeled solar wind\nprotons. According to our model, energy and momentum are transferred from the\nsolar wind to the coma in a single region, centered on the nucleus, with a size\nin the order of 1000 km. This interaction affects, over larger scales, the\ndownstream modeled solar wind flow. The energy gained by the cometary ions is a\nsmall fraction of the energy available in the solar wind.

Our recent experimental results show that, due to the effect of kinetic\ninductance, for a SNSPD made of a nanowire of sufficient length, its geometry\nlength can be comparable to or even longer than the effective wavelength of\nfrequencies contained in the output pulse. In other words, a superconducting\nnanowire can behave as a distributed transmission line so that the readout\npulse depends on the photon detection location and the transmission line\nproperties of the nanowire. Here, we develop a distributed model for a\nsuperconducting nanowire and apply it to simulate the output performance of a\nlong nanowire designed into a coplanar waveguide. We compare this coplanar\nwaveguide geometry to a conventional meander nanowire geometry. The simulation\nresults agree well with our experimental observations.

The phase transition takes\nplace due to the formation of surface Andreev bound states in unconventional\nsuperconductors. Based on the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity, we\nexamine the influence of atomic-scale surface roughness on the surface phase\ntransition temperature $T_s$. To describe the surface effect, the boundary\ncondition for the quasiclassical Green's function is parameterized in terms of\nspecularity (the specular reflection probability in the normal state at the\nFermi level). This boundary condition allows systematic study of the surface\neffect ranging from the specular limit to the diffuse limit. We show that\ndiffuse quasiparticle scattering at a rough surface causes substantial\nreduction of $T_s$ in the d-wave pairing state of high-$T_c$ cuprate\nsuperconductors. We also consider a p-wave pairing state in which Andreev bound\nstates similar to those in the d-wave state are generated. In contrast to the\nd-wave case, $T_s$ in the p-wave state is insensitive to the specularity. This\nis because the Andreev bound states in the p-wave superconductor are robust\nagainst diffuse scattering, as implied from symmetry consideration for\nodd-frequency Cooper pairs induced at the surface; the p-wave state has\nodd-frequency pairs with s-wave symmetry, while the d-wave state does not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 07:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel\nco-segmentation approach that transfers patch-level local object shapes which\nappear more consistent across different images. In our framework, a multi-scale\npatch neighbourhood system is first generated using proposal flow on arbitrary\nimage-pair, which is further refined by Locally Linear Embedding.

Recently, the cascaded pose regression has attracted\nincreasing attentions, due to it's superior performance in facial landmark\nlocalization and occlusion detection. However, such an approach is sensitive to\ninitialization, where an improper initialization can severly degrade the\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a Robust Initialization for Cascaded\nPose Regression (RICPR) by providing texture and pose correlated initial shapes\nfor the testing face. By examining the correlation of local binary patterns\nhistograms between the testing face and the training faces, the shapes of the\ntraining faces that are most correlated with the testing face are selected as\nthe texture correlated initialization. To make the initialization more robust\nto various poses, we estimate the rough pose of the testing face according to\nfive fiducial landmarks located by multitask cascaded convolutional networks.\nThen the pose correlated initial shapes are constructed by the mean face's\nshape and the rough testing face pose. Finally, the texture correlated and the\npose correlated initial shapes are joined together as the robust\ninitialization. We evaluate RICPR on the challenging dataset of COFW.

HD 4747B is a brown dwarf\nclose to the H burning mass limit, orbiting a nearby, solar-type star and has\nbeen observed with the radial velocity method over almost two decades now. Its\ncompanion was also recently detected by direct imaging, allowing a complete\nstudy of this particular object. We aim to fully characterize HD 4747B by\ncombining a well constrained dynamical mass and a study of its observed\nspectral features in order to test evolutionary models for substellar objects\nand characterize its atmosphere. We combine the radial velocity measurements of\nHIRES and CORALIE taken over two decades and high contrast imaging of several\nepochs from NACO, NIRC2 and SPHERE to obtain a dynamical mass. From the SPHERE\ndata we obtain a low resolution spectrum of the companion from Y to H band, as\nwell as two narrow band-width photometric measurements in the K band. A study\nof the primary star allows in addition to constrain the age of the system as\nwell as its distance. Thanks to the new SPHERE epoch and NACO archival data\ncombined with previous imaging data and high precision radial velocity\nmeasurements, we have been able to derive a well constrained orbit. We derive a\ndynamical mass of mB=70.0$\\pm$1.6 MJup which is higher than a previous study,\nbut in better agreement with the models. By comparing the object with known\nbrown dwarfs spectra, we derive a spectral type of L9 and an effective\ntemperature of 1350$\\pm$50 K. With a retrieval analysis we constrain the oxygen\nand carbon abundances and compare them with the ones from the HR 8799 planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 08:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

This yields a\nunique DM temperature evolution, $T_{\\chi} \\propto 1 / a$, in contrast to $\nT_{\\chi} \\propto 1 / a^{2}$ for free-streaming non-relativistic particles.\nSelf-heating continues as long as self-scattering sufficiently redistributes\nthe energy of DM particles. In this paper, we study the evolution of\ncosmological perturbations in self-heating DM. We find that sub-GeV\nself-heating DM leaves a cutoff on the subgalactic scale of the matter power\nspectrum when the self-scattering cross section is $\\sigma_{\\rm self} /\nm_{\\chi} \\sim {\\cal O} (1) \\,{\\rm cm}^{2} /{\\rm g}$.

Therefore, it is of\nprimary importance to fully understand their generation mechanisms in order to\ndesign mitigation systems able to guarantee safe tokamak operations. In a\nprevious work, [3], a test particle tracker was introduced in the JOREK 3D\nnon-linear MHD code and used for studying the electron confinement during a\nsimulated JET-like disruption. It was found in [3] that relativistic electrons\nare not completely deconfined by the stochastic magnetic field taking place\nduring the disruption thermal quench (TQ). This is due to the reformation of\nclosed magnetic surfaces at the beginning of the current quench (CQ). This\nresult was obtained neglecting the inductive electric field in order to avoid\nthe unrealistic particle acceleration which otherwise would have happened due\nto the absence of collision effects. The present paper extends [3] analysing\ntest electron dynamics in the same simulated JET-like disruption using the\ncomplete electric field. For doing so, a simplified collision model is\nintroduced in the particle tracker guiding center equations. We show that\nelectrons at thermal energies can become RE during or promptly after the TQ due\nto a combination of three phenomena: a first REs acceleration during the TQ due\nto the presence of a complex MHD-induced electric field, particle reconfinement\ncaused by the fast reformation of closed magnetic surfaces after the TQ and a\nsecondary acceleration induced by the CQ electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 09:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 09:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

For Be 55, we\nfind a distance of 2.2+/-0.3 kpc and age of 63(+12,-11) Myr, locating the\ncluster in the Local arm. Taken together with our recent discovery of a\nlong-period Cepheid in the starburst cluster VdBH222, these represent an\nimportant increase in the number of young, massive Cepheids known in Galactic\nopen clusters. We also consider new Gaia (data release 2) parallaxes and proper\nmotions for members of Be 51 and Be 55; the uncertainties on the parallaxes do\nnot allow us to refine our distance estimates to these clusters, but the\nwell-constrained proper motion measurements furnish further confirmation of\ncluster membership. However, future final Gaia parallaxes for such objects\nshould provide valuable independent distance measurements, improving the\ncalibration of the period-luminosity relationship, with implications for the\ndistance ladder out to cosmological scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 09:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 08:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

A core component of such course is the design and implementation of\nthe query optimizer in a RDBMS. The goal of the query optimizer is to\nautomatically identify the most efficient execution strategies for executing\nthe declarative SQL queries submitted by users. The query optimization process\nproduces a query execution plan (QEP) which represents an execution strategy\nfor the query. Due to the complexity of the underlying query optimizer,\ncomprehension of a QEP demands that a student is knowledgeable of\nimplementation-specific issues related to the RDBMS.

In this demonstration, we present a\nnovel system called NEURON that facilitates natural language interaction with\nQEPs to enhance its understanding. NEURON accepts a SQL query (which may\ninclude joins, aggregation, nesting, among other things) as input, executes it,\nand generates a simplified natural language-based description (both in text and\nvoice form) of the execution strategy deployed by the underlying RDBMS.\nFurthermore, it facilitates understanding of various features related to the\nQEP through a natural language-based question answering framework.

The resulting crystallites are\nclearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures. In contrast,\ndroplets in a fully periodic calculational cell remain stable to lower\ntemperatures and eventually show the same spontaneous localization of the\ndensity into 'atoms' but in an amorphous structure having many of the\nstructural charactersitics of a glass. A small change of the protocol leads, at\nthe same temperature, to the formation of crystals, this time with the FCC\nstructure typical of bulk Lennard-Jones solids. The FCC crystals have lower\nfree energy than the amorphous structures which in turn are more stable than\nthe liquid droplets.

In this work, we make\na case for approximate computing for data analytics in IoT settings.\nApproximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an\napproximate output is sufficient instead of the exact output. The idea behind\napproximate computing is to compute over a representative sample instead of the\nentire input dataset.

The key to successful multi-label learning algorithms\nlies in the exploration of inter-label correlations, which usually incur great\ncomputational cost. Another notable factor in multi-label learning is that the\nlabel vectors are usually extremely sparse, especially when the candidate label\nvocabulary is very large and only a few instances are assigned to each\ncategory. Recently, a label space transformation (LST) framework has been\nproposed targeting these challenges. However, current methods based on LST\nusually suffer from information loss in the label space dimension reduction\nprocess and fail to address the sparsity problem effectively. In this paper, we\npropose a distribution-based label space transformation (DLST) model. By\ndefining the distribution based on the similarity of label vectors, a more\ncomprehensive label structure can be captured. Then, by minimizing\nKL-divergence of two distributions, the information of the original label space\ncan be approximately preserved in the latent space. Consequently, multi-label\nclassifier trained using the dense latent codes yields better performance. The\nleverage of distribution enables DLST to fill out additional information about\nthe label correlations. This endows DLST the capability to handle label set\nsparsity and training data sparsity in multi-label learning problems. With the\noptimal latent code, a kernel logistic regression function is learned for the\nmapping from feature space to the latent space. Then ML-KNN is employed to\nrecover the original label vector from the transformed latent code. Extensive\nexperiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DLST not only\nachieves high classification performance but also is computationally more\nefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 10:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

In\nparticular, the design of an accelerator with strict requirements on the beam\nquality, such as a free electron laser (FEL), is highly dependent on a\ncorrespondence between simulation, theory and experiments in order to correctly\naccount for the effect of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR), and other\ncollective effects. A traditional approach in accelerator simulation codes is\nto utilise an analytic one-dimensional approximation to the CSR force. We\npresent an extension of the 1D CSR theory in order to correctly account for the\nCSR force at the entrance and exit of a bending magnet. A limited range of\napplicability to this solution, in particular in bunches with a large\ntransverse spot size or offset from the nominal axis, is recognised. More\nrecently developed codes calculate the CSR effect in dispersive regions\ndirectly from the Lienard-Wiechert potentials, albeit with approximations to\nimprove the computational time.

Local-global solvers developed in\nrecent years can quickly compute an approximate solution to such problems,\nmaking them an attractive choice for applications that prioritize efficiency\nover accuracy.

Above the mean field transition temperature $T_0$, the\nfluctuation of the superconducting order parameter gives the additional\nconductivity, i.e., paraconductivity. Extending the analysis to the nonlinear\nresponse, we obtain the nonreciprocal charge transport expressed by $a_2(B,T) =\na_1(T) \\gamma(T) B$, where $\\gamma$ converges to a finite value at $T=T_0$.\nBelow $T_0$, the vortex motion is relevant to the voltage drop, and the\ndependence of $a_j$ on $B,T$ is different depending on the system and\nmechanisms.

Such diverse relevance patterns require an ideal retrieval model\nto be able to assess relevance in the right granularity adaptively.\nUnfortunately, most existing retrieval models compute relevance at a single\ngranularity, either document-wide or passage-level, or use fixed combination\nstrategy, restricting their ability in capturing diverse relevance patterns. In\nthis work, we propose a data-driven method to allow relevance signals at\ndifferent granularities to compete with each other for final relevance\nassessment. Specifically, we propose a HIerarchical Neural maTching model\n(HiNT) which consists of two stacked components, namely local matching layer\nand global decision layer. The local matching layer focuses on producing a set\nof local relevance signals by modeling the semantic matching between a query\nand each passage of a document. The global decision layer accumulates local\nsignals into different granularities and allows them to compete with each other\nto decide the final relevance score. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nHiNT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art retrieval models significantly\non benchmark ad-hoc retrieval datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 12:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

The Orion A and B clouds are well known active star-forming\nregions, while the $\\lambda$ Orionis cloud has a different environment as a\nconsequence of the interaction with a prominent OB association and a giant Hii\nregion. PGCCs in the $\\lambda$ Orionis cloud have higher dust temperatures\n($Td=16.13\\pm0.15$ K) and lower values of dust emissivity spectral index ($\n\\beta=1.65\\pm0.02$) than PGCCs in the Orion A (Td=13.79$\\pm 0.21$K,\n$\\beta=2.07\\pm0.03$) and Orion B ($Td=13.82\\pm0.19$K, $\\beta=1.96\\pm0.02$)\nclouds. We find 119 sub-structures within the 40 detected PGCCs and identify\nthem as cores. Of total 119 cores, 15 cores are discovered in the $\\lambda$\nOrionis cloud, while 74 and 30 cores are found in the Orion A and B clouds,\nrespectively. The cores in the $\\lambda$ Orionis cloud show much lower mean\nvalues of size R=0.08 pc, column density N(H2)=$(9.5\\pm1.2) \\times 10^{22}$\ncm$^{-2}$, number density n(H2)=$(2.9 \\pm 0.4)\\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and mass\n$M_{core}$=$1.0\\pm0.3$ M$_{\\odot}$ compared to the cores in the Orion A\n(R=0.11pc, $N(H2)=(2.3\\pm0.3) \\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, n(H2)=$(3.8\\pm0.5)\n\\times 10^{5}$cm$^{-3}$, and $M_{core}$=$2.4 \\pm 0.3$ M$_{\\odot}$) and Orion B\n(R=0.16pc, N(H2)=$(3.8 \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$,\nn(H2)=$(15.6\\pm1.8)\\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $M_{core}$= $2.7\\pm0.3$\nM$_{\\odot}$) clouds.

We prove\nthat different optimization methods, including gradient method and Adagrad,\nequipped with curvature exploitation can escape non-optimal stationary points.\nWe also provide empirical results on common saddle point problems which confirm\nthe advantage of using curvature exploitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 13:22:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 19:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 12:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

What is special for these black hole solutions is that\nthe scalarization is not due to the presence of matter, but {it is induced} by\nthe curvature of spacetime itself. Moreover, more than one branch of scalarized\nsolutions can bifurcate from the Schwarzschild branch, and these scalarized\nbranches are characterized by the number of nodes of the scalar field. The next\nstep is to consider the linear stability of these solutions, which is\nparticularly important due to the fact that the Schwarzschild black holes lose\nstability at the first point of bifurcation. Therefore we here study in detail\nthe radial perturbations of the scalarized EGB black holes. The results show\nthat all branches with a nontrivial scalar field with one or more nodes are\nunstable. The stability of the solutions on the fundamental branch, whose\nscalar field has no radial nodes, depends on the particular choice of the\ncoupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. We\nconsider two particular cases based on the previous studies of the background\nsolutions.

It has been suggested that self-gravity can significantly affect the\nevolution of such vortices. We present the results of 2D hydrodynamical\nsimulations of the evolution of vortices forming at a pressure bump in\nself-gravitating discs with Toomre parameter in the range $4-30$. We consider\nisothermal plus non-isothermal disc models that employ either the classical\n$\\beta$ prescription or a more realistic treatment for cooling. The main aim is\nto investigate whether the condensating effect of self-gravity can stabilize\nvortices in sufficiently massive discs. We confirm that in isothermal disc\nmodels with ${\\cal Q} \\gtrsim 15$, vortex decay occurs due to the vortex\nself-gravitational torque. For discs with $3\\lesssim {\\cal Q} \\lesssim 7$, the\nvortex develops gravitational instabilities within its core and undergoes\ngravitational collapse, whereas more massive discs give rise to the formation\nof global eccentric modes. In non-isothermal discs with $\\beta$ cooling, the\nvortex maintains a turbulent core prior to undergoing gravitational collapse\nfor $\\beta \\lesssim 0.1$, whereas it decays if $\\beta \\ge 1$.

It is found that the most probable scenario for the energy\nrelease in the PIL is the tether-cutting magnetic reconnection between the\nlow-lying (3 Mm above the photosphere) magnetic loops within a twisted magnetic\nflux rope. Energetic electrons with the hardest spectrum were appeared at the\nonset of plasma heating up to the super-hot temperature of 40 MK.

Where such deviations\nare relevant for the estimand, we are typically required to make an untestable\nassumption about post-deviation behaviour in order to perform our primary\nanalysis and estimate the treatment effect. In such settings, it is now widely\nrecognised that we should follow this with sensitivity analyses to explore the\nrobustness of our inferences to alternative assumptions about post-deviation\nbehaviour. Although there has been a lot of work on how to conduct such\nsensitivity analyses, little attention has been given to the appropriate loss\nof information due to missing data within sensitivity analysis. We argue more\nattention needs to be given to this issue, showing it is quite possible for\nsensitivity analysis to decrease and increase the information about the\ntreatment effect. To address this critical issue, we introduce the concept of\ninformation-anchored sensitivity analysis. By this we mean sensitivity analysis\nin which the proportion of information about the treatment estimate lost due to\nmissing data is the same as the proportion of information about the treatment\nestimate lost due to missing data in the primary analysis.

The main problem\nwith phase transition stems from the inconsistency of the primary variables\nsuch as phase pressure and phase saturation, i.e. they become ill-defined when\na phase appears or disappears. Recently, a new approach for handling phase\ntransition has been developed, whereby the system is formulated as a nonlinear\ncomplementarity problem (NCP). Unlike the widely used primary variable\nswitching (PVS) method which requires a drastic reduction of the time step size\nwhen a phase appears or disappears, this approach is more robust and allows for\nlarger time steps. One way to solve an NCP system is to reformulate the\ninequality constraints as a non-smooth equation using a complementary function\n(C-function). Because of the non-smoothness of the constraint equations, a\nsemi-smooth Newton method needs to be developed. In this work, we consider two\nmethods for solving NCP systems used to model multiphase flow: (1) a\nsemi-smooth Newton method for two C-functions: the minimum and the\nFischer-Burmeister functions, and (2) a new inexact Newton method based on the\nJacobian smoothing method for a smooth version of the Fischer-Burmeister\nfunction. We show that the new method is robust and efficient for standard\nbenchmark problems as well as for realistic examples with highly heterogeneous\nmedia such as the SPE10 benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 14:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Our results on Cifar-100 and on ImageNet datasets show the state of\nthe art search accuracy in precision@k and NMI metrics while providing up to\n98X and 478X search speedup respectively over exhaustive linear search.

However, in 3D\ndiscs vortices are subject to destructive `elliptic instabilities', which\nreduces their viability as dust traps. The survival of vortices in 3D accretion\ndiscs is thus an important issue to address. In this work, we perform shearing\nbox simulations to show that disc self-gravity enhances the survival of 3D\nvortices, even when self-gravity is weak in the classic sense (e.g. with a\nToomre $Q\\simeq5$). We find a 3D, self-gravitating vortex can grow on secular\ntimescales in spite of the elliptic instability. The vortex aspect-ratio\ndecreases as it strengthens, which feeds the elliptic instability.

In what\nfollows, we assume that these properties of the Earth are unknown, and instead\nattempt to derive them from first principles.

Because the pore size is\ntypically smaller than the mean free path of gas molecules, their flow is\nconventionally described by the Knudsen theory that assumes diffuse reflection\n(random-angle scattering) at confining walls. This assumption has proven to\nhold surprisingly well in experiment, and only a few cases of partially\nspecular (mirror-like) reflection are known. Here we report gas transport\nthrough angstrom-scale channels with atomically-flat walls and show that\nsurface scattering can be both diffuse or specular, depending on fine details\nof the surface atomic landscape, and quantum effects contribute to the\nspecularity at room temperature. The channels made from graphene or boron\nnitride allow a helium gas flow that is orders of magnitude faster than\nexpected from the theory. This is explained by specular surface scattering,\nwhich leads to ballistic transport and frictionless gas flow. Similar channels\nbut with molybdenum disulfide walls exhibit much slower permeation that remains\nwell described by Knudsen diffusion. The difference is attributed to stronger\natomic corrugations at MoS2 surfaces, which are similar in height to the size\nof transported atoms and their de Broglie wavelength. The importance of the\nlatter, matter-wave contribution is corroborated by the observation of a\nreversed isotope effect in which the mass flow of hydrogen is notably higher\nthan that of deuterium, in contrast to the relation expected for classical\nflows. Our results provide insights into atomistic details of molecular\npermeation, which so far could be accessed only in simulations, and show a\npossibility of studying gas transport under a controlled confinement comparable\nto the quantum-mechanical size of atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 15:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

Though a disputed term,\nwe take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates\nopenness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of\nopen governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet,\nthat are crucial.

There are also other\ntechnologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to\nassist open governance.

Based on this view, we systematically present security\nand privacy requirements in terms of IoT system, software, networking and big\ndata analytics in the cloud. Second, using the end-to-end view of IoT security\nand privacy, we present a vulnerability analysis of the Edimax IP camera\nsystem. We are the first to exploit this system and have identified various\nattacks that can fully control all the cameras from the manufacturer. Our\nreal-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovered attacks\nand raise the alarms again for the IoT manufacturers. Third, such\nvulnerabilities found in the exploit of Edimax cameras and our previous exploit\nof Edimax smartplugs can lead to another wave of Mirai attacks, which can be\neither botnets or worm attacks. To systematically understand the damage of the\nMirai malware, we model propagation of the Mirai and use the simulations to\nvalidate the modeling. The work in this paper raises the alarm again for the\nIoT device manufacturers to better secure their products in order to prevent\nmalware attacks like Mirai.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 15:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

In this work\nwe study the metastable branch for a prototypical inference problem, the\nlow-rank matrix factorization, that presents a hard phase.

The goal of the observations\nis to study the kinematics of the [OIII]5007 narrow emission line region (NLR)\nof the quasar, and investigate the origin of the velocity offsets originally\nmeasured for different UV lines. The results show that i) the spatial structure\nof the NLR is complex. The [OIII]5007 line shows significant velocity offsets\nwith respect to the systemic redshift of the source. Different components at\ndifferent velocities (-670, -100, + 75 km s^-1) are produced in different\nregions of the source. ii) we detect both the narrow and the broad components\nof the Hbeta line. The narrow component generally follows the kinematics of the\n[OIII] line, while the broad component is significantly blue-shifted. The peak\nof the broad line is near the blue end, or possibly outside of the sensitivity\nband of the instrument, implying a velocity offset of >~1800 km s^-1. This\nresult is in agreement with the interpretation of the QSO as a GW recoiling\nblack hole.

Exploring this problem, were able to produce standalone\nlinear resistors showing strongly reduced thermal noise.

To address this problem, in this\npaper, we present a robust and efficient graph correspondence transfer (REGCT)\napproach for explicit spatial alignment in Re-ID. Specifically, we propose to\nestablish the patch-wise correspondences of positive training pairs via graph\nmatching. By exploiting both spatial and visual contexts of human appearance in\ngraph matching, meaningful semantic correspondences can be obtained. To\ncircumvent the cumbersome \\emph{on-line} graph matching in testing phase, we\npropose to transfer the \\emph{off-line} learned patch-wise correspondences from\nthe positive training pairs to test pairs. In detail, for each test pair, the\ntraining pairs with similar pose-pair configurations are selected as\nreferences. The matching patterns (i.e., the correspondences) of the selected\nreferences are then utilized to calculate the patch-wise feature distances of\nthis test pair. To enhance the robustness of correspondence transfer, we design\na novel pose context descriptor to accurately model human body configurations,\nand present an approach to measure the similarity between a pair of pose\ncontext descriptors. Meanwhile, to improve testing efficiency, we propose a\ncorrespondence template ensemble method using the voting mechanism, which\nsignificantly reduces the amount of patch-wise matchings involved in distance\ncalculation. With aforementioned strategies, the REGCT model can effectively\nand efficiently handle the spatial misalignment problem in Re-ID. Extensive\nexperiments on five challenging benchmarks, including VIPeR, Road, PRID450S,\n3DPES and CUHK01, evidence the superior performance of REGCT over other\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 13:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

An important application of such a counting of degrees\nof freedom relation would be to invoke restrictions on the number of families\nthat could be possible under the assumption, that all the fermions in nature\nare the result of fermionizing a system of boson species. Since a theory of\nfundamental fermions can be accused for not being properly local because of\nhaving anticommutativity at space like distances rather than commutation as is\nmore physically reasonable to require, it is in fact called for to have all\nfermions arising from fermionization of bosons. To make a realistic scenario\nwith the fermions all coming from fermionizing some bosons we should still have\nat least some not fermionized bosons and we are driven towards that being a\ngravitational field, that is not fermionized. Essentially we reach the\nspin-charge-families theory by one of us (N.S.M.B.) with the detail that the\nnumber of fermion components and therefore of families get determined from what\npossibilities for fermionization will finally turn out to exist.

One of the strongest\ncriticisms to this paradigm is the limited reproducibility of the process,\nespecially at largely oversubscribed facilities. In this and in a subsequent\npaper we address this specific aspect in a quantitative way, through a\nstatistical study on proposal ranking at the European Southern Observatory. For\nthis purpose we analysed a sample of about 15000 proposals, submitted by more\nthan 3000 Principal Investigators over 8 years. The proposals were reviewed by\nmore than 500 referees, who assigned over 140000 grades in about 200 panel\nsessions. After providing a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of\nthe sample, the paper presents an heuristic model based on these findings,\nwhich is then used to provide quantitative estimates of the reproducibility of\nthe pre-meeting process. On average, about one third of the proposals ranked in\nthe top quartile by one referee are ranked in the same quartile by any other\nreferee of the panel. A similar value is observed for the bottom quartile. In\nthe central quartiles, the agreement fractions are very marginally above the\nvalue expected for a fully aleatory process (25%). The agreement fraction\nbetween two panels composed by 6 referees is 55+/-5% (50% confidence level) for\nthe top and bottom quartiles. The corresponding fraction for the central\nquartiles is 33+/-5%. The model predictions are confirmed by the results\nobtained from boot-strapping the data for sub-panels composed by 3 referees,\nand fully consistent with the NIPS experiment.
