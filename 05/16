We develop an extended percolation method to allow the comparison of\ngeometrical properties of the real cosmic web with the simulated dark matter\nweb for an ensemble of over- and under-density systems. Methods. We scan\ndensity fields of dark matter (DM) model and SDSS observational samples, and\nfind connected over- and underdensity regions in a large range of threshold\ndensities. Lengths, filling factors and numbers of largest clusters and voids\nas functions of the threshold density are used as percolation functions.\nResults. We find that percolation functions of DM models of different box sizes\nare very similar to each other. This stability suggests that properties of the\ncosmic web, as found in the present paper, can be applied to the cosmic web as\na whole. Percolation functions depend strongly on the smoothing length. At\nsmoothing length 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc the percolation threshold density for clusters\nis $\\log P_C = 0.718 \\pm 0.014$, and for voids is $\\log P_V = -0.816 \\pm\n0.015$, very different from percolation thresholds for random samples, $\\log\nP_0 = 0.00 \\pm 0.02$. Conclusions. The extended percolation analysis is a\nversatile method to study various geometrical properties of the cosmic web in a\nwide range of parameters. Percolation functions of the SDSS sample are very\ndifferent from percolation functions of DM model samples. The SDSS sample has\nonly one large percolating void which fills almost the whole volume. The SDSS\nsample contains numerous small isolated clusters at low threshold densities,\ninstead of one single percolating DM cluster. These differences are due to the\ntenuous dark matter web, present in model samples, but absent in real\nobservational samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 16:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

This typically entails propagating narrowband illumination through\nthe system pupil, and comparing the detected photon rate across the focal plane\nto the amount of incident light as measured by a calibrated photodiode.\nHowever, stray light effects and reflections/ghosting (especially on the edges\nof filter passbands) in the optical train constitute a major source of\nsystematic uncertainty when using a flat-field screen as the illumination\nsource. A collimated beam projector that projects a mask onto the focal plane\nof the instrument can distinguish focusing light paths from stray and scattered\nlight, allowing for a precise determination of instrumental throughput.

In addition to providing a precise system\nthroughput calibration, by monitoring the evolution of the intensity and\nbehaviour of the ghosts in the optical system, the collimated beam projector\ncan be used to track the evolution of the filter transmission properties and\nvarious anti-reflective coatings in the optical system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 16:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

In this work, we\nextensively perform numerical simulations to explore scenarios of planet-planet\nscattering among circumbinary planets and subsequent tidal capture in various\nbinary configurations, to examine whether the mechanism can play a part in\nproducing such kind of planets.

The capture\nprobability is related to binary configurations, where a smaller eccentricity\nor a low mass ratio of the binary will lead to a larger probability of capture,\nand vice versa. Furthermore, we find that S-type planets with retrograde orbits\ncan be naturally produced via capture process. These planets on retrograde\norbits can help us distinguish in situ formation and post-capture origin for\nS-type planet in close binaries systems.

We discuss prospects for improving measurements of\ndark matter distributions, and how these interplay with future indirect dark\nmatter searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 16:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

The architecture also incorporates an on-chip\nbalance network to enhance the transmitter (TX)-receiver (RX) isolation.

The\nanalyses are verified by simulation and measurement results of a 65 nm CMOS 750\nMHz circulator-receiver prototype. The circulator-receiver can handle up to +8\ndBm of TX power, with 8 dB noise figure (NF) and 40 dB average isolation over\n20 MHz RF bandwidth (BW). In conjunction with digital self-interference (SI)\nand its third-order intermodulation (IM3) cancellation, the FD circ.-RX\ndemonstrates 80 dB overall SI suppression for up to +8 dBm TX average output\npower.

Fortuitously, the TMJ is the only joint\nwhose kinematics can be accurately measured with optical methods, because the\nbones of the lower and upper jaw are rigidly connected to the lower and upper\nteeth. We construct a person-specific jaw kinematic model by asking an actor to\nexercise the entire range of motion of the jaw while keeping the lips open so\nthat the teeth are at least partially visible. This performance is recorded\nwith three calibrated cameras. We obtain highly accurate 3D models of the teeth\nwith a standard dental scanner and use these models to reconstruct the rigid\nbody trajectories of the teeth from the videos (markerless tracking). The\nrelative rigid transformations samples between the lower and upper teeth are\nmapped to the Lie algebra of rigid body motions in order to linearize the\nrotational motion. Our main contribution is to fit these samples with a\nthree-dimensional nonlinear model parameterizing the entire range of motion of\nthe TMJ.

This\nforce explicitly breaks quantum numbers associated with dark matter/baryon\nabundance at later stages. As a particular realization of the mechanism we\nintroduce a super-heavy complex scalar field with the mass larger than the\nHubble rate during the last e-folds of inflation. The global U(1)-symmetry is\nviolated due to the linear coupling of the phase of the complex scalar to the\ninflaton. The symmetry breaking leads to the generation of a non-zero Noether\ncharge.

We consider a basic three-node\nMEC system consisting of a user node, a helper node, and an access point (AP)\nnode attached with an MEC server, in which the user has latency-constrained and\ncomputation-intensive tasks to be executed. We consider two different\ncomputation offloading models, namely the partial and binary offloading,\nrespectively. Under this setup, we focus on a particular finite time block and\ndevelop an efficient four-slot transmission protocol to enable the joint\ncomputation and communication cooperation. Besides the local task computing\nover the whole block, the user can offload some computation tasks to the helper\nin the first slot, and the helper cooperatively computes these tasks in the\nremaining time; while in the second and third slots, the helper works as a\ncooperative relay to help the user offload some other tasks to the AP for\nremote execution in the fourth slot. For both cases with partial and binary\noffloading, we jointly optimize the computation and communication resources\nallocation at both the user and the helper (i.e., the time and transmit power\nallocations for offloading, and the CPU frequencies for computing), so as to\nminimize their total energy consumption while satisfying the user's computation\nlatency constraint. Although the two problems are non-convex in general, we\npropose efficient algorithms to solve them optimally. Numerical results show\nthat the proposed joint computation and communication cooperation approach\nsignificantly improves the computation capacity and energy efficiency at the\nuser and helper nodes, as compared to other benchmark schemes without such a\njoint design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 16:55:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 05:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Applications\nrunning concurrently on a multicore system interfere with each other at the\nmain memory. This interference can slow down different applications\ndifferently. Accurately estimating the slowdown of each application in such a\nsystem can enable mechanisms that can enforce quality-of-service. While much\nprior work has focused on mitigating the performance degradation due to\ninter-application interference, there is little work on accurately estimating\nslowdown of individual applications in a multi-programmed environment. Our goal\nis to accurately estimate application slowdowns, towards providing predictable\nperformance.\n  To this end, we first build a simple Memory Interference-induced Slowdown\nEstimation (MISE) model, which accurately estimates slowdowns caused by memory\ninterference. We then leverage our MISE model to develop two new memory\nscheduling schemes: 1) one that provides soft quality-of-service guarantees,\nand 2) another that explicitly attempts to minimize maximum slowdown (i.e.,\nunfairness) in the system. Evaluations show that our techniques perform\nsignificantly better than state-of-the-art memory scheduling approaches to\naddress the same problems.\n  Our proposed model and techniques have enabled significant research in the\ndevelopment of accurate performance models [35, 59, 98, 110] and interference\nmanagement mechanisms [66, 99, 100, 108, 119, 120].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 17:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

One lesser studied tactic is content\nrepublishing, which can be used to make specific stories seem more important,\ncreate uncertainty around an event, or create a perception of credibility for\nunreliable news sources. In this paper, we take a first step in understanding\nthis tactic by exploring verbatim content copying across 92 news producers of\nvarious characteristics. We find that content copying occurs more frequently\nbetween like-audience sources (eg. alternative news, mainstream news, etc.),\nbut there consistently exists sparse connections between these communities.

Specifically, we find that mainstream sources change more structural\nfeatures, while alternative sources change many more content features, often\nchanging the emotional tone and bias of the titles. We conclude that content\nrepublishing networks can help identify and label the intent of brand-new news\nsources using the tight-knit community they belong to.

Using bare spin configurations as input, the\napproach is shown to be capable of classifying samples of the two-dimensional\nXY model by winding number and capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition. We also demonstrate the success of the approach on the Ising gauge\ntheory, another paradigmatic model with topological order. In addition, a\nconnection between the output of diffusion maps and the eigenstates of a\nquantum-well Hamiltonian is derived. Topological classification via diffusion\nmaps can therefore enable fully unsupervised studies of exotic phases of\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 18:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 01:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

More\nconcretely, by applying the Hamiltonian formalism and introducing a dynamical\ndeformation, between the momenta associated to the FLRW scale factor and the BD\nscalar field, we obtain the modified equations of motion. In particular, these\nequations reduce to their standard counterparts when the noncommutative (NC)\nparameter is switched off. By focusing on a specific branch of solutions, in\ncontrast to standard frameworks (even with a varying BD coupling parameter), we\nshow that we can obtain an adequate appropriate inflationary epoch possessing a\nsuitable graceful exit. In other words, in the Jordan frame (JF), such branch\nof solutions properly satisfy the sufficient condition required for\nsatisfactory inflation, which is equivalent to get an inflationary phase in the\nconformal Einstein frame (EF) without branch change.

This view is strengthened by the observation that\nhigh-inclination and retrograde Centaurs (Tisserand parameters with respect to\nJupiter $T_J < 2$) which have the longest median dynamical lifetime ($=1.37\n\\times 10^6$ yr) are all inactive. We also find that the perihelion distances\nof some active, comet-like Centaurs have experienced drastic drops of a few au\nin the recent past ($\\sim 10^2-10^3$ yr), while such drops are not found among\ninactive Centaurs. Inactive Centaurs with $T_J \\lsim 2.5$ usually evolve to\nHalley-type comets, whereas inactive Centaurs with $T_J \\gsim 2.5$ and active\nCentaurs (that also have $T_J \\gsim 2.5$) evolve almost always to Jupiter\nfamily comets and very seldom to Halley type comets. Inactive Centaurs are also\nmore prone to end up as sungrazers, and both inactive and active Centaurs\ntransit through different mean motion resonances (generally with Jupiter)\nduring their evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 18:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In\nthis work we test whether deep reinforcement learning agents explicitly\nrepresent other agents' intentions (their specific aims or goals) during a task\nin which the agents had to coordinate the covering of different spots in a 2D\nenvironment. In particular, we tracked over time the performance of a linear\ndecoder trained to predict the final goal of all agents from the hidden state\nof each agent's neural network controller. We observed that the hidden layers\nof agents represented explicit information about other agents' goals, i.e. the\ntarget landmark they ended up covering. We also performed a series of\nexperiments, in which some agents were replaced by others with fixed goals, to\ntest the level of generalization of the trained agents. We noticed that during\nthe training phase the agents developed a differential preference for each\ngoal, which hindered generalization. To alleviate the above problem, we propose\nsimple changes to the MADDPG training algorithm which leads to better\ngeneralization against unseen agents.

Three\ndifferent patterns of traffic flow towards the intersection have been tested.\nThe system requires less waiting time, compared to the other models, including\nthe random case where the flow is unpredictable. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\nalgorithm has been used to predict vehicles making a right turn at the\nintersection. The experimental results show there is no chance of collision\ninside the intersection using the proposed model; however, the system might\nrequire more space in the traffic lane for some specific traffic patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 20:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

Confounding can be defined as a statistical\nassociation between two variables due to inputs from a common source (the\nconfounder). For example, if $Z\\rightarrow Y$ and $Z\\rightarrow X$, then $X$\nand $Y$ will be statistically dependent, even if there are no causal\nconnections between the two. There are several approaches available to adjust\nfor confounding, i.e. to remove, or reduce, the association between two\nvariables due to the confounder. Common adjustment techniques include\nstratifying the analysis on the confounder, and including confounders as\ncovariates in regression models. Most adjustments rely on the assumption that\nthe causal effects of confounders, on different variables, do not co-vary. For\nexample, if the causal effect of $Z$ on $X$ and the causal effect of $Z$ on $Y$\nco-vary between observational units, a confounding effect remains after\nadjustment for $Z$. This causal-effect covariability and its consequences is\nthe topic of this paper.\n  Causal-effect covariability is first explicated using the framework of\nstructural causal models. Using this framework it is easy to show that\ncausal-effect covariability generally leads to confounding that cannot be\nadjusted for by standard methods. Evidence from data indicates that the\nconfounding introduced by causal-effect covariability might be a real concern\nin applied work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 21:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

Recently, the FCC has\ntargeted the sharing of the 3.5 GHz (3550-3700 MHz) federal spectrum with\ncommercial systems such as small cells. The rules require a Spectrum Access\nSystem (SAS) to accommodate three service tiers: 1) Incumbent Access, 2)\nPriority Access (PA), and 3) Generalized Authorized Access (GAA). In this work,\nwe study the SAS-assisted dynamic channel assignment (CA) for PA and GAA\ntiers.We introduce the node-channel-pair conflict graph to capture pairwise\ninterference, channel and geographic contiguity constraints, spatially varying\nchannel availability, and coexistence awareness. The proposed conflict graph\nallows us to formulate PA CA and GAA CA with binary conflicts as\nmax-cardinality and max-reward CA, respectively. Approximate solutions can be\nfound by a heuristic-based algorithm that search for the maximum weighted\nindependent set. We further formulate GAA CA with non-binary conflicts as\nmax-utility CA. We show that the utility function is submodular, and the\nproblem is an instance of matroid-constrained submodular maximization. A\npolynomial-time algorithm based on local search is proposed that provides a\nprovable performance guarantee. Extensive simulations using a real-world Wi-Fi\nhotspot location dataset are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms.

The hard and soft spectral states of\nCyg X-1 are interpreted in terms of co-spatial two component flows for the\ninnermost region of an accretion disk. The state transitions result from the\noutward expansion and inward recession of this inner disk for the hard to soft\nand soft to hard transition respectively. The theoretical framework for state\ntransitions in black hole X-ray binaries with high mass companions involving a\nchange in the inner disk size, thus, differs from systems with low mass\ncompanions involving the change in the outer disk size. This fundamental\ndifference stems from the fact that matter captured and supplied to the black\nhole in wind-fed systems has low specific angular momentum and is hot\nessentially heated in the bow and spiral shocks, whereas it has high specific\nangular momentum and is cool in Roche lobe overflow systems. The existence of a\nweak cool disk around the ISCO region in the hard state allows for the presence\nof a relativistically broadened Fe K line. The small disk fed by gas\ncondensation forms without an extensive outer disk, precluding thermal\ninstabilities and large outbursts, resulting in the lack of large amplitude\noutbursts and hysteresis effects in the light curve of high mass black hole\nX-ray binaries.

While environmental phenomena\ntypically exhibit weakening spatial dependence at increasingly extreme levels,\nlimiting max-stable process models for block maxima have a rigid dependence\nstructure that does not capture this type of behavior. We propose a flexible\nBayesian model from a broader family of (conditionally) max-infinitely\ndivisible processes that allows for weakening spatial dependence at\nincreasingly extreme levels, and due to a hierarchical representation of the\nlikelihood in terms of random effects, our inference approach scales to large\ndatasets. Therefore, our model not only has a flexible dependence structure,\nbut it also allows for fast, fully Bayesian inference, prediction and\nconditional simulation in high dimensions. The proposed model is constructed\nusing flexible random basis functions that are estimated from the data,\nallowing for straightforward inspection of the predominant spatial patterns of\nextremes. In addition, the described process possesses (conditional)\nmax-stability as a special case, making inference on the tail dependence class\npossible. We apply our model to extreme precipitation in North-Eastern America,\nand show that the proposed model adequately captures the extremal behavior of\nthe data. Interestingly, we find that the principal modes of spatial variation\nestimated from our model resemble observed patterns in extreme precipitation\nevents occurring along the coast (e.g., with localized tropical cyclones and\nconvective storms) and mountain range borders. Our model, which can easily be\nadapted to other types of environmental datasets, is therefore useful to\nidentify extreme weather patterns and regions at risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 01:17:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 21:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

The base-station selects beam-alignment or data\ncommunication and the beam parameters, based on feedback from the user-end.\nBased on the sectored antenna model and uniform prior on the angles of\ndeparture and arrival (AoD/AoA), the optimality of a fixed-length\nbeam-alignment phase followed by a data-communication phase is demonstrated.\nMoreover, a decoupled fractional beam-alignment method is shown to be optimal,\nwhich decouples over time the alignment of AoD and AoA, and iteratively scans a\nfraction of their region of uncertainty. A heuristic policy is proposed for\nnon-uniform prior on AoD/AoA, with provable performance guarantees, and it is\nshown that the uniform prior is the worst-case scenario.

A task of major\npractical importance in these application domains is inferring the network\nstructure from noisy observations at a subset of nodes. Available methods for\ntopology inference typically assume that the process over the network is\nobserved at all nodes. However, application-specific constraints may prevent\nacquiring network-wide observations. Alleviating the limited flexibility of\nexisting approaches, this work advocates structural models for graph processes\nand develops novel algorithms for joint inference of the network topology and\nprocesses from partial nodal observations. Structural equation models (SEMs)\nand structural vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) have well-documented\nmerits in identifying even directed topologies of complex graphs; while SEMs\ncapture contemporaneous causal dependencies among nodes, SVARMs further account\nfor time-lagged influences. This paper develops algorithms that iterate between\ninferring directed graphs that \"best\" fit the data, and estimating the network\nprocesses at reduced computational complexity by leveraging tools related to\nKalman smoothing. To further accommodate delay-sensitive applications, an\nonline joint inference approach is put forth that even tracks time-evolving\ntopologies. Furthermore, conditions for identifying the network topology given\npartial observations are specified. It is proved that the required number of\nobservations for unique identification reduces significantly when the network\nstructure is sparse. Numerical tests with synthetic as well as real datasets\ncorroborate the effectiveness of the novel approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 02:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Aside from the many advantages provided by these services, they\nhave caused serious concerns regarding the location privacy of users. An\nadversary such as an untrusted location-based server can monitor the queried\nlocations by a user to infer critical information such as the user's home\naddress, health conditions, shopping habits, etc. To address this issue,\ndummy-based algorithms have been developed to increase the anonymity of users,\nand thus, protecting their privacy. Unfortunately, the existing algorithms only\nconsider a limited amount of side information known by an adversary which may\nface more serious challenges in practice. In this paper, we incorporate a new\ntype of side information based on consecutive location changes of users and\npropose a new metric called transition-entropy to investigate the location\nprivacy preservation, followed by two algorithms to improve the\ntransition-entropy for a given dummy generation algorithm.

Next, in order to protect the users from\nViterbi attack, we propose an algorithm called robust dummy generation (RDG)\nwhich can resist against the Viterbi attack while maintaining a high\nperformance in terms of the privacy metrics introduced in the paper.

However, as appealing as this\ngoal might be, it is still unrealized due to the modest thermoelectric\ncoefficient and weak temperature-dependence of carrier transport in graphene.\nHere, we demonstrate mid-infrared graphene detectors consisting of arrays of\nplasmonic resonators interconnected by quasi one-dimensional nanoribbons.\nLocalized barriers associated with disorder in the nanoribbons produce a\ndramatic temperature dependence of carrier transport, thus enabling the\nelectrical detection of plasmon decay in the nearby graphene resonators.

The magnetic plasma deorbit\nutilizes the plasma drag force generated by the interaction between space\nplasma and the magnetic field surrounding magnetic torquers (MTQs). In this\nstudy, the plasma drag force generated by the magnetic plasma deorbit method is\nestimated by using a plasma flow simulation based on the fully kinetic model.\nThe dependences of the plasma drag force on the MTQ angle, atmospheric plasma\ndensity, and MTQ magnetic moment are investigated. The simulation results show\nthat the structures of the bow shock and magnetosphere are formed in the\nvicinity of the MTQs. The predicted plasma drag force is 105.2 nN for an MTQ of\n10 A m$^2$ when the MTQ magnetic moment is parallel to the satellite velocity\ndirection. The plasma drag force shows a strong dependence on the magnetic\nmoment angle. In addition, the plasma drag force is proportional to the\natmospheric plasma density and the MTQ magnetic moment.

Under the\nassumption that it is rank--revealing QR (RRQR), the approximation error\nincurred is similar to the POD error and, furthermore, we show the existence of\nan RRQR with exactly same error estimate as POD. To numerically realize an RRQR\ndecomposition, we will discuss the (iterative) modified Gram Schmidt with\npivoting (MGS) and reduced basis method by employing a greedy strategy.

We propose a fast algorithm to compute travel-time sensitivity\nkernels under the assumption that the background solar medium is spherically\nsymmetric.

Here, we compute the spherical\nharmonic decomposition of the kernels and show that the integrals in latitude\nand longitude can be performed analytically. In particular, the integrals of\nthe product of three associated Legendre polynomials can be computed thanks to\nthe algorithm of Dong and Lemus (2002).

The computation time is reduced by two orders of magnitude compared\nto other recent computational frameworks.

Nevertheless,\nthe design of computation offloading policies for a virtual MEC system remains\nchallenging. Specifically, whether to execute a computation task at the mobile\ndevice or to offload it for MEC server execution should adapt to the\ntime-varying network dynamics.

Thus, a theory describing the equilibrium dynamics of two\nhydrodynamically coupled Brownian harmonic oscillators in a viscoelastic\nMaxwell fluid has been derived which appears with new and impressive aspects.\nInitially, the response functions have been calculated and then the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem has been used to calculate the correlation\nfunctions between the coloured noises present on the concerned particles placed\nin a Maxwell fluid due to the thermal motions of the fluid molecules. These\ncorrelation functions appear to be in a linear relationship with the\ndelta-correlated noises in a viscous fluid. Consequently, this reduces the\nstatistical description of a simple viscoelastic fluid to the statistical\nrepresentation for an extended dynamical system subjected to delta-correlated\nrandom forces.

According to an\nempirical experiment with two longitudinal DNS datasets, irrespective of the\ncriterion, the agility bias is observed to be severe particularly regarding the\neffect of outlying domains hosted and delivered via content delivery networks\nand cloud computing services. With these observations, the paper contributes to\nthe research domains of cyber security and DNS mining. In a larger context of\napplied graph mining, the paper further elaborates the practical concerns\nrelated to the learning of large and dynamic bipartite graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 07:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

As a\nstorage solution for large-scale HPC systems, dozens of applications share the\nsame storage system, and will compete and can interfere with each other.\nApplication interference can dramatically degrade the overall storage system\nperformance. Therefore, developing a flexible and effective storage solution to\nassure a certain level of resources per application, i.e. the\nQuality-of-Service (QoS) support, is critical. One of the common solution to\nachieve QoS assurance for storage systems is using provisioning\ntechnique~\\cite{3}. Provisioning refers to the ability of providing certain\namount of resources for applications and expected workloads. However,\nprovisioning has limitations such as requiring the detailed knowledge of the\nexpected workloads. In addition, the storage workloads are transient hence\nexpensive to be satisfied. Due to these limitations, providing QoS storage\nsystems through provisioning is challenging.\n  In this research, a software-defined approach~\\cite{0} is proposed as a\nflexible solution to achieve QoS guarantee for storage systems. The driving\nforce of using a software-defined approach instead of the traditional\napproaches, is that it has the ability to enable a more flexible, scalable, and\nefficient platform. For example, if any changes occurred in the system, it does\nnot necessarily need to re-configure thousands of devices; instead, with\nre-configuring a logically centralized component, other devices will be\nautomatically notified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 07:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

Whilst our first implementation is simpler and\nmay be better suited for developing a program logic for SI transactions, our\nsecond implementation is more practical due to its non-prescience. We show that\nboth implementations are sound and complete against the declarative SI\nspecification and thus yield equivalent operational definitions for SI.\n  We further consider, for the first time formally, the use of SI in a context\nwith racy non-transactional accesses, as can arise in STM implementations of\nSI. We introduce robust snapshot isolation (RSI), an adaptation of SI with\nsimilar semantics and guarantees in this mixed setting. We present a\ndeclarative specification of RSI as an acyclicity axiom and analogously develop\ntwo operational models as lock-based reference implementations (one eager, one\nlazy). We show that these operational models are both sound and complete\nagainst the declarative RSI model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 08:59:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 16:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

In\nparticular, capturing real-time content in Internet browsers and smartphone\napplications is problematic because geometric distortion such as scaling and\ntranslation frequently occurs. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural\nnetwork-based template architecture that compensates for the disadvantages of\nexisting watermarking techniques that are vulnerable to geometric distortion.\nThe proposed template consists of a template generation network, a template\nextraction network, and a template matching network. The template generation\nnetwork generates a template in the form of noise and the template is inserted\ninto certain pre-defined spatial locations of the image. The extraction network\ndetects spatial locations where the template is inserted in the image. Finally,\nthe template matching network estimates the parameters of the geometric\ndistortion by comparing the shape of spatial locations where the template was\ninserted with the locations where the template was detected. It is possible to\nrecover an image in its original geometrical form using the estimated\nparameters, and as a result, watermarks applied using existing watermarking\ntechniques that are vulnerable to geometric distortion can be decoded normally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 09:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

H. Boyer, Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 9}, 2078 (1974)]. Its most characteristic\nproperty is that it is repulsive. The problem is actually delicate and\ncounterintuitive, since it implies, for instance, that in the boundary layer of\nthe electric plate the square $E^2$ of the electric field becomes a negative\nquantity. In the present paper we analyze the problem by first considering the\nsimple harmonic oscillator model introduced by us earlier [J. S. H{\\o}ye {\\it\net al.}, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 67}, 056116 (2003); Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 94}, 032113\n(2016)]. Extension of this model shows how the repulsive behavior can be\nunderstood on a microscopic basis, due to the duality between canonical and\nmechanical momenta in presence of the electromagnetic vector potential. This\nduality corresponds to the TM and TE modes in electrodynamics. We analyze the\ngeneralized Boyer case where the permittivities and permeabilities of the\nparallel plates are arbitrary. In this respect we first find the induced\ninteraction between a pair of particles with given electric and magnetic\npolarizabilities and then find it for a pair of parallel plates. The method\nused for our evaluations is the statistical mechanical one that we have\nintroduced and applied earlier. Whether the pair of particles or plates attract\nor repel each other depends on their polarizabilities or permittivities and\npermeabilities respectively. For equal particles or equal plates there is\nalways attraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 10:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Even\nthough this seems to work quite well for main-sequence stars, there is\nempirical evidence, mainly from studies of eclipsing binary systems, that the\nseismic scaling relations overestimate the mass and radius of red giants by\nabout 15 and 5\\%, respectively. Model-based corrections of the $\\Delta\\nu\n-$scaling reduce the problem but do not solve it. We re-examine the global\noscillation parameters of the giants in the binary systems in order to\ndetermine their seismic fundamental parameters and find them to agree with the\ndynamic parameters from the literature if we adopt nonlinear scalings.

The compositional scheme is based on small-gain type\nreasoning. In particular, we use a notion of so-called alternating simulation\nfunctions as a relation between each subsystem and its symbolic model. Assuming\nsome small-gain type conditions, we construct compositionally an overall\nalternating simulation function as a relation between an interconnection of\nsymbolic models and that of original control subsystems. In such\ncompositionality reasoning, the gains associated with the alternating\nsimulation functions of the subsystems satisfy a certain \"small-gain\"\ncondition. In addition, we introduce a technique to construct symbolic models\ntogether with their corresponding alternating simulation functions for\ndiscrete-time control subsystems under some stability property. Finally, we\napply our results to the temperature regulation in a circular building by\nconstructing compositionally a finite abstraction of a network containing $N$\nrooms for any $N\\geq3$. We use the constructed symbolic models as substitutes\nto synthesize controllers compositionally maintaining room temperatures in a\ncomfort zone. We choose $N=1000$ for the sake of illustrating the results. We\nalso apply our proposed techniques to a nonlinear example of fully connected\nnetwork in which the compositionality condition still holds for any number of\ncomponents. In these case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed\nresults in comparison with the existing compositionality technique in the\nliterature using a dissipativity-type reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 12:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 15:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

In this work, we compare a sample of period change that are\nreal-time observations of stellar evolution with new evolution models to test\nthe impact of these first two processes. In our previous study we found that\nenhanced mass loss is crucial for describing the sample, and here we continue\nthat analysis but for rotational mixing and core overshooting.

A common approach\nis to use embedding techniques to represent graphs as points in a conventional\nEuclidean space, but non-Euclidean spaces have often been shown to be better\nsuited for embedding graphs. Among these, constant-curvature Riemannian\nmanifolds (CCMs) offer embedding spaces suitable for studying the statistical\nproperties of a graph distribution, as they provide ways to easily compute\nmetric geodesic distances. In this paper, we focus on the problem of detecting\nchanges in stationarity in a stream of attributed graphs. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel change detection framework based on neural networks and CCMs,\nthat takes into account the non-Euclidean nature of graphs.

The user quality-of-experience (QoE) degrades and varies\nwith time because of these factors.

Towards this end, we propose a nonlinear state space model\nfor efficiently and effectively predicting the user QoE on a continuous time\nbasis.

The prior\nwork has culminated with methodology for quantitative estimation of\ntechnological improvement rates for nearly any technology. This paper examines\nthe implications of such regular time dependence for performance upon the\ntiming of key events in the technological adoption process. We propose a simple\ncrossover point in performance which is based upon the technological\nimprovement rates and current level differences for target and replacement\ntechnologies.

The uncertainty analysis around the cases highlight opportunities\nfor organizations to reduce future technological uncertainty.

Segmentation of the spinal cord and lesions from MRI\ndata provides measures of damage, which are key criteria for the diagnosis,\nprognosis, and longitudinal monitoring in MS. Automating this operation\neliminates inter-rater variability and increases the efficiency of\nlarge-throughput analysis pipelines. Robust and reliable segmentation across\nmulti-site spinal cord data is challenging because of the large variability\nrelated to acquisition parameters and image artifacts. The goal of this study\nwas to develop a fully-automatic framework, robust to variability in both image\nparameters and clinical condition, for segmentation of the spinal cord and\nintramedullary MS lesions from conventional MRI data.

Many algorithms have been\nproposed to handle these difficulties, among them, the Very Fast Decision Tree\n(VFDT) algorithm. Although the VFDT has been widely used in data stream mining,\nin the last years, several authors have suggested modifications to increase its\nperformance, putting aside memory concerns by proposing memory-costly\nsolutions. Besides, most data stream mining solutions have been centred around\nensembles, which combine the memory costs of their weak learners, usually\nVFDTs. To reduce the memory cost, keeping the predictive performance, this\nstudy proposes the Strict VFDT (SVFDT), a novel algorithm based on the VFDT.\nThe SVFDT algorithm minimises unnecessary tree growth, substantially reducing\nmemory usage and keeping competitive predictive performance. Moreover, since it\ncreates much more shallow trees than VFDT, SVFDT can achieve a shorter\nprocessing time. Experiments were carried out comparing the SVFDT with the VFDT\nin 11 benchmark data stream datasets. This comparison assessed the trade-off\nbetween accuracy, memory, and processing time. Statistical analysis showed that\nthe proposed algorithm obtained similar predictive performance and\nsignificantly reduced processing time and memory use.

These\nstudies only analyzed partial safety impacts of signal spacing and access\ndensity, as these factors would significantly influence the safety performance\nof both intersections and roadway segments. Macro level safety modeling was\nusually applied to investigate the relationship between the zonal crash\nfrequencies and demographics, road network features and traffic\ncharacteristics. In this study, a new modeling strategy was proposed to analyze\nthe safety impacts of roadway network features (i.e., road network patterns,\nsignal spacing and access density) of arterials by applying a macro level\nsafety modeling technique. Bayesian Conditional Autoregressive models were\ndeveloped for arterials covering 173 Traffic Analysis Zones in the suburban\narea in Shanghai. The results identified that the road network pattern with\ncollector roads parallel to the arterials was shown to be associated with fewer\ncrashes than those without parallel collectors. Higher signal density and\naccess density also tended to increase crash frequencies on arterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 15:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 03:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 05:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

The weakly nonlinear Boussinesq system is considered with\nthe addition of a solid object lying on the flat bottom, allowed to move\nhorizontally under the pressure forces created by the waves. We present an\naccurate finite difference scheme for this physical model, finely tuned to\npreserve important features of the original coupled system: nonlinear effects\nfor the waves, energy dissipation due to the frictional movement of the solid.\nThe moving bottom case is compared with a system where the same object is fixed\nto the bottom in order to observe the qualitative and quantitative differences\nin wave transformation. In particular a loss of wave amplitude is observed. The\ninfluence of the friction on the whole system is also measured, indicating\ndifferences for small and large coefficients of friction. Overall, hydrodynamic\ndamping effects reminiscent to the dead-water phenomenon can be established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 13:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

However, the search for active\nnanoparticle catalysts is hindered by laborious effort of experimental\nsynthesis and measurements. On the other hand, DFT-based approaches are still\ntime consuming and often not efficient. In this study, we introduce a\ncomputational model which enables rapid catalytic activity calculation of\nunstrained pure Pt nanoparticle electrocatalysts. The generic setup of the\ncomputational model is based on DFT results and experimental data obtained\nworldwide over the past ca 20 years; whereas, importantly, the computational\nmodel dispenses with DFT calculations during runtime. This realizes feasible\nand sharply reduced computation effort in comparison to theoretical approaches\nwhere DFT calculations must be performed for each nanoparticle individually.\nRegarding particle size effects on Pt nanoparticles, experimental catalytic\nmass activities from previous studies are accurately reproduced by our\ncomputational model. Shedding light on the parameter space of particle size\neffects, this study enables predictions beyond available experiments: Our\ncomputational model identifies potential enhancement in mass activity up to\n190% over the experimentally detected maximum. Importantly, the rapid activity\ncalculation enabled by our computational model may pave the way for extensive\nnanoparticle screening to expedite the search for improved electrocatalysts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 20:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}
