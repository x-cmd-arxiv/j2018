A\nversatile double power-law Schechter function is used to fit the dark matter\nhalo AF, and its derived parameters are studied as a function of halo isolation\nstatus. Results. (a) Our function fits the halo abundances for all halo\nisolation statuses extremely well, while the well-established theoretical mass\nfunctions, integrated over the volume of the light-cone, provide an adequate\nbut poorer fit than our phenomenological model.

Using\nthe SCM framework, we formally showed in previous works that the causal\nodds-ratio of a given factor correlated with high speed cannot be unbiasedly\nestimated through responsibility analyses if inclusion into the dataset depends\non the accident severity. The objective of this present work is to present\nnumerical results to give a first quantification of the magnitude of the\nselection bias induced by responsibility analyses. We denote the binary\nvariables by X the exposure of interest, V the high speed, F the driving fault,\nR the responsibility of a severe accident, A the severe accident, and W a set\nof categorical confounders. We illustrate the potential bias by comparing the\ncausal effect of interest of X on R, COR(X,R|W=w), and the estimable odds-ratio\navailable in responsibility analyses, OR(X,R|W=w, A=1). By considering a binary\nexposure, and by varying a set of parameters, we describe a situation where X\ncould represent alcohol or cannabis intoxication. We confirm that the estimable\nodds-ratio available in responsibility analyses is a biased measure of the\ncausal effect when X is correlated with high speed V and V is related to the\naccident severity A. In this case, the magnitude of the bias is all the more\nimportant that these two relationships are strong. When X is likely to increase\nthe risk to drive fast V, the estimable odds-ratio underestimates the causal\neffect. When X is likely to decrease the risk to drive fast V, the estimable\nodds-ratio upperestimates the causal effect. The values of the different causal\nquantities considered here are from one to five times higher (or lower) than\nthe estimable quantity available in responsability analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 16:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

This leads to the\nso-called `inside-out disc formation scenario'. Yet, these are probably the\nmost unconstrained inputs of such models. In the present paper, we aim at\ninvestigating these main assumptions by studying how gas is accreted in four\nsimulated MW-like galaxies assembled within the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario. The\ngalaxies were obtained using two different simulation techniques, cosmological\nsetups and initial conditions. Two of them are MW candidates corresponding to\nthe chemodynamical model of Minchev et al. (2013, 2014) (known as MCM) and the\nLocal Group cosmological simulation of Nuza et al. (2014). We investigate\nvertical and radial gas accretion on to galaxy discs as a function of cosmic\ntime and disc radius. We find that accretion in the MW-like galaxies seem to\nhappen in two distinct phases, namely: an early, more violent period; followed\nby a subsequent, slowly declining phase. Our simulations seem to give support\nto the assumption that the amount of gas incorporated into the MW disc\nexponentially decreases with time, leading to current net accretion rates of\n$0.6-1\\,$M$_\\odot\\,$yr$^{-1}$. In particular, accretion timescales on to the\nsimulated thin-disc-like structures are within $\\sim5-7\\,$Gyr, consistent with\nexpectations from CEMs. Moreover, our simulated MW discs are assembled from the\ninside-out with gas in the inner disc regions accreted in shorter timescales\nthan in external ones, in qualitative agreement with CEMs of the Galaxy.\nHowever, this type of growth is not general to all galaxies and it is\nintimately linked to their particular merger and gas accretion history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 17:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Here, we introduce Regularization Learning Networks (RLNs),\nwhich overcome this challenge by introducing an efficient hyperparameter tuning\nscheme which minimizes a new Counterfactual Loss. Our results show that RLNs\nsignificantly improve DNNs on tabular datasets, and achieve comparable results\nto GBTs, with the best performance achieved with an ensemble that combines GBTs\nand RLNs. RLNs produce extremely sparse networks, eliminating up to 99.8% of\nthe network edges and 82% of the input features, thus providing more\ninterpretable models and reveal the importance that the network assigns to\ndifferent inputs. RLNs could efficiently learn a single network in datasets\nthat comprise both tabular and unstructured data, such as in the setting of\nmedical imaging accompanied by electronic health records. An open source\nimplementation of RLN can be found at\nhttps://github.com/irashavitt/regularization_learning_networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 17:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 12:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

We study the formation of\nBH triples via binary-binary encounters in dense clusters, showing that\none-third of triples formed through this channel are in a non-hierarchical,\nunstable configuration. We build a database of $32,000$ $N$-body simulations to\ninvestigate the evolution of these BH triples. Varying the mutual orbital\ninclination, the three BH masses and the inner and outer eccentricities, we\nshow that retrograde, nearly planar configurations lead to a significant\nshrinkage of the inner binary. We find an universal trend of triple systems,\nnamely that they tend to evolve toward prograde configurations and that the\norbital flip, driven by the torque exerted on the inner BH binary (BHB) by the\nouter BH, leads in general to tighter inner orbits that, in some cases, merge\nwithin a Hubble time. We find that the mergers' mass distribution maps the\noriginal BH binary spectrum. A large fraction of merging BHBs with initial\nseparation $1$ AU enter the $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ Hz frequency band with large\neccentricities, thus representing potential eccentric LISA sources.

The\npresence of HRLs in this range is unusual for PNe and has not been reported in\nMz 3 before. Our analysis indicates that the HRLs we observed are enhanced by\nlaser effect occurring in the core of Mz 3. Our arguments for this are: (i) the\navailable Mz 3 optical to submillimetre HRL $\\alpha$ line intensity ratios are\nnot well reproduced by the spontaneous emission of optically thin ionized gas,\nas would be typical for nebular gas in PNe; (ii) the compact core of Mz 3 is\nresponsible for a large fraction of the Herschel HRLs emission; (iii) the line\nintensity ratios for Mz 3 are very similar to those in the core emission of the\nwell known star MWC 349A, where laser effect is responsible for the enhancement\nof HRLs in the Herschel wavelength range; (iv) the physical characteristics\nrelevant to cause laser effect in the core of MWC 349A are very similar to\nthose in the core of Mz 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 19:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

Our\nresults suggest that in all the planets of study the ellipsoidal effect is very\nweak, while the Doppler beaming effect is in general dominant. In fact, the\nlatter effect seems to be confirmed as the principal cause of variations of the\nlight curves for the planets. This affirmation could not be definitive in\nMercury or Venus where the Doppler beaming and the reflection effects have\nsimilar amplitudes. The obtained phase curves for the Solar System planets show\ninteresting new features that have not been presented before, so the results\npresented here are relevant in their application to other non-compact systems,\nsince they allow us to have an idea of what it is expected to find in their\nlight curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 20:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

For this new 3D cellular architecture, a\nnovel framework for network planning for drone-BSs as well as latency-minimal\ncell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable\nmethod for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron\nshapes is proposed that ensures full coverage for a given space with minimum\nnumber of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D\nwireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency\nreuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme\nis developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission,\ncomputation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial\ndistribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation\nmethod, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a\ncross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of\ndrone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell\nassociation for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from optimal transport\ntheory. Simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency\nof drone-UEs compared to the classical cell association approach that uses a\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the\nproposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the average latency\ncompared to the SINR-based association.

This work proposes a joint classification-and-prediction\nframework based on CNNs for automatic sleep staging, and, subsequently,\nintroduces a simple yet efficient CNN architecture to power the framework.\nGiven a single input epoch, the novel framework jointly determines its label\n(classification) and its neighboring epochs' labels (prediction) in the\ncontextual output. While the proposed framework is orthogonal to the widely\nadopted classification schemes, which take one or multiple epochs as contextual\ninputs and produce a single classification decision on the target epoch, we\ndemonstrate its advantages in several ways. First, it leverages the dependency\namong consecutive sleep epochs while surpassing the problems experienced with\nthe common classification schemes. Second, even with a single model, the\nframework has the capacity to produce multiple decisions, which are essential\nin obtaining a good performance as in ensemble-of-models methods, with very\nlittle induced computational overhead. Probabilistic aggregation techniques are\nthen proposed to leverage the availability of multiple decisions. We conducted\nexperiments on two public datasets: Sleep-EDF Expanded with 20 subjects, and\nMontreal Archive of Sleep Studies dataset with 200 subjects. The proposed\nframework yields an overall classification accuracy of 82.3% and 83.6%,\nrespectively.

Harnessing\navailable information on the geographical position of vehicles and spectrum\nresources utilization, eNodeBs are capable of allotting the same set of\nsidelink resources to several different vehicles in order for them to broadcast\ntheir signals. Hence, vehicles sharing the same resources would ideally be in\ndifferent communications clusters for the interference level-generated due to\nresource repurposing-to be maintained under control. Within a communications\ncluster, it is crucial that vehicles transmit in orthogonal time resources to\nprevent conflicts as vehicles-with half-duplex radio interfaces--cannot\ntransmit and receive simultaneously. In this research, we have envisaged a\nsolution based on a bipartite graph, where vehicles and spectrum resources are\nrepresented by vertices whereas the edges represent the achievable rate in each\nresource based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) that\nvehicles perceive. The aforementioned constraint on time orthogonality of\nallocated resources can be approached by aggregating conflicting vertices into\nmacro-vertices which, in addition, narrows the search space yielding a solution\nwith computational complexity equivalent to the conventional graph matching\nproblem. We show mathematically and through simulations that the proposed\napproach yields an optimal solution. In addition, we provide simulations\nshowing that the proposed method outperforms other competing approaches,\nspecially in scenarios with high vehicular density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 23:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

In particular, complete suppression of light reflectance at select\nfrequencies accompanied by sharp phase variations in the reflected signal forms\nthe basis for the development of ultra-sensitive singular-phase optical\ndetection schemes such as Brewster and surface plasmon interferometry. However,\nboth the Brewster effect and surface-plasmon-mediated absorption on planar\ninterfaces are limited to one polarization of the incident light and oblique\nexcitation angles, and may have limited bandwidth dictated by the material\ndielectric index and plasma frequency. To alleviate these limitations, we\ndesign narrow-band super-absorbers composed of plasmonic materials embedded\ninto dielectric photonic nanostructures with topologically-protected\ninterfacial Tamm plasmon states. These structures have planar geometry and do\nnot require nanopatterning to achieve perfect absorption of both polarizations\nof the incident light in a wide range of incident angles, including the normal\nincidence. Their absorption lines are tunable across a very broad spectral\nrange via engineering of the photon bandstructure of the dielectric photonic\nnanostructures to achieve reversal of the geometrical phase across the\ninterface with the plasmonic absorber. We outline the design strategy to\nachieve perfect absorptance in Tamm structures with dissipative losses via\nconjugate impedance matching.

One of the challenges in the analysis is that the\nquality of the retinal image is often degraded. For example, a cataract in\nhuman lens will attenuate the retinal image, just as a cloudy camera lens which\nreduces the quality of a photograph. It often obscures the details in the\nretinal images and posts challenges in retinal image processing and analysing\ntasks. In this paper, we approximate the degradation of the retinal images as a\ncombination of human-lens attenuation and scattering. A novel\nstructure-preserving guided retinal image filtering (SGRIF) is then proposed to\nrestore images based on the attenuation and scattering model. The proposed\nSGRIF consists of a step of global structure transferring and a step of global\nedge-preserving smoothing.

The model comprises limit-cycle oscillators with distributed\nnatural frequencies interacting through a mean-field coupling. Although more\nthan forty years have passed since its introduction, the model continues to\noccupy the centre-stage of research in the field of non-linear dynamics, and is\nalso widely applied to model diverse physical situations. In this brief review,\nstarting with a derivation of the Kuramoto model and the synchronization\nphenomenon it exhibits, we summarize recent results on the study of a\ngeneralized Kuramoto model that includes inertial effects and stochastic noise.\nWe describe the dynamics of the generalized model from a different yet a rather\nuseful perspective, namely, that of long-range interacting systems driven out\nof equilibrium by quenched disordered external torques. A system is said to be\nlong-range interacting if the inter-particle potential decays slowly as a\nfunction of distance. Using tools of statistical physics, we highlight the\nequilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of the dynamics of the generalized\nKuramoto model, and uncover a rather rich and complex phase diagram that it\nexhibits, which underlines the basic theme of intriguing emergent phenomena\nthat are exhibited by many-body complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 08:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

Moreover, their effect on the communication quality is\nintractable in all but the simplest cases. The present work proposes a new\nparadigm, where indoor scattering becomes software-defined and, subsequently,\noptimizable across wide frequency ranges. Moreover, the controlled scattering\ncan surpass natural behavior, exemplary overriding Snell's law, reflecting\nwaves towards any custom angle (including negative ones). Thus, path loss and\nmulti-path fading effects can be controlled and mitigated. The core technology\nof this new paradigm are metasurfaces, planar artificial structures whose\neffect on impinging electromagnetic waves is fully defined by their\nmacro-structure. The present study contributes the software-programmable\nwireless environment model, consisting of several HyperSurface tiles controlled\nby a central, environment configuration server. HyperSurfaces are a novel class\nof metasurfaces whose structure and, hence, electromagnetic behavior can be\naltered and controlled via a software interface. Multiple networked tiles coat\nindoor objects, allowing fine-grained, customizable reflection, absorption or\npolarization overall. A central server calculates and deploys the optimal\nelectromagnetic interaction per tile, to the benefit of communicating devices.\nRealistic simulations using full 3D ray-tracing demonstrate the groundbreaking\npotential of the proposed approach in 2.4 GHz and 60 GHz frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 10:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

The ultimate goal of this project is to derive\nmodel-free distances to the host galaxy of one or more gamma-ray burst\nsupernova (GRB-SN), and to exploit their observed luminosity$-$decline\nrelationship by employing them as cosmological probes. In the first part of a\ntwo-paper analysis, I present my method for deriving the dilution factors of\nthe SE-SN sample, which were chosen on the basis that\ncosmological-model-independent distances exist to their host galaxies, and each\nhas a sufficient dataset that allows for host-subtracted, dereddened rest-frame\n$BVI$ LCs to be constructed, and time-series spectra. A Planck function was fit\nto the data to derive the blackbody radius and blackbody temperature as a\nfunction of time, while the blueshifted velocity of either Si II $\\lambda$6355\nor Fe II $\\lambda$5169 was used a proxy of the photospheric velocity, and hence\nphotospheric radius. The ratio of these empirically derived radii was taken as\nthe dilution/correct factor. I then compared the empirically derived dilution\nfactors with synthetic values obtained from radiative transfer models\ncalculated for SE-SNe arising from binary systems. It is seen that the\nempirical dilution factors of the SNe Ic and GRB-SNe, the latter which were\nderived based on luminosity distances calculated from their spectroscopic\nredshift, are very similar. It is found that the dilution factors of the two\nrelativistic SN IcBL are very different to those of the GRB-SNe, meaning that\nthese engine-driven events may arise from fundamentally different progenitor\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 10:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

MEC will\ninspire the development of myriads of applications and services with demand for\nultra low latency and high Quality of Service (QoS) due to its dense\ngeographical distribution and wide support for mobility. MEC is therefore an\nimportant enabler of IoT applications and services which require real-time\noperations. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview on the exploitation\nof MEC technology for the realization of IoT applications and their synergies.\nWe further discuss the technical aspects of enabling MEC in IoT and provide\nsome insight into various other integration technologies therein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 10:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

A word equation relates two words over string variables and\nconstants. Its solution amounts to a function mapping variables to constant\nstrings that equate the left and right hand sides of the equation. While the\nproblem of solving word equations is decidable, the decidability of the problem\nof solving a word equation with a length constraint (i.e., a constraint\nrelating the lengths of words in the word equation) has remained a\nlong-standing open problem. In this paper, we focus on the subclass of\nquadratic word equations, i.e., in which each variable occurs at most twice. We\nfirst show that the length abstractions of solutions to quadratic word\nequations are in general not Presburger-definable. We then describe a class of\ncounter systems with Presburger transition relations which capture the length\nabstraction of a quadratic word equation with regular constraints. We provide\nan encoding of the effect of a simple loop of the counter systems in the theory\nof existential Presburger Arithmetic with divisibility (PAD). Since PAD is\ndecidable, we get a decision procedure for quadratic words equations with\nlength constraints for which the associated counter system is \\emph{flat}\n(i.e., all nodes belong to at most one cycle). We show a decidability result\n(in fact, also an NP algorithm with a PAD oracle) for a recently proposed\nNP-complete fragment of word equations called regular-oriented word equations,\ntogether with length constraints. Decidability holds when the constraints are\nadditionally extended with regular constraints with a 1-weak control structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 11:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

While this can be addressed as a supervised learning problem,\na significantly more challenging problem is that of detecting the\nunknown/unseen anomaly case that takes us instead into the space of a\none-class, semi-supervised learning paradigm. We introduce such a novel anomaly\ndetection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that\njointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference\nof latent space. Employing encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks in the\ngenerator network enables the model to map the input image to a lower dimension\nvector, which is then used to reconstruct the generated output image. The use\nof the additional encoder network maps this generated image to its latent\nrepresentation. Minimizing the distance between these images and the latent\nvectors during training aids in learning the data distribution for the normal\nsamples. As a result, a larger distance metric from this learned data\ndistribution at inference time is indicative of an outlier from that\ndistribution - an anomaly.

A subsequence with stable illumination condition\nis first selected for background estimation. Images are segmented into\nsuperpixels to preserve spatial texture information and foreground objects are\neliminated by superpixel motion filtering process. A low-complexity\ndensity-based clustering is then performed to generate reliable background\ncandidates for final background determination.

Extensive experiments are performed on\nsynthetic and real-world datasets to illustrate that our approach outperforms\nthe brute-force method and MSM, a multi-step filter mechanism over the\nmulti-scaled representation by orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 13:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

This\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) has been intensively studied in a variety of\nferro- and ferrimagnetic materials because it provides a powerful probe for\nelectronic and magnetic properties as well as for various applications\nincluding magneto-optical recording. Recently, there has been a surge of\ninterest in antiferromagnets (AFMs) as prospective spintronic materials for\nhigh-density and ultrafast memory devices, owing to their vanishingly small\nstray field and orders of magnitude faster spin dynamics compared to their\nferromagnetic counterparts. In fact, the MOKE has proven useful for the study\nand application of the antiferromagnetic (AF) state. Although limited to\ninsulators, certain types of AFMs are known to exhibit a large MOKE, as they\nare weak ferromagnets due to canting of the otherwise collinear spin structure.\nHere we report the first observation of a large MOKE signal in an AF metal at\nroom temperature. In particular, we find that despite a vanishingly small\nmagnetization of $M \\sim$0.002 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$/Mn, the non-collinear AF metal\nMn$_3$Sn exhibits a large zero-field MOKE with a polar Kerr rotation angle of\n20 milli-degrees, comparable to ferromagnetic metals. Our first-principles\ncalculations have clarified that ferroic ordering of magnetic octupoles in the\nnon-collinear Neel state may cause a large MOKE even in its fully compensated\nAF state without spin magnetization. This large MOKE further allows imaging of\nthe magnetic octupole domains and their reversal induced by magnetic field. The\nobservation of a large MOKE in an AF metal should open new avenues for the\nstudy of domain dynamics as well as spintronics using AFMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 13:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

However, the implementation of\nthe conventional continuous-time SMC on digital computers is limited, due to\nthe imprecisions caused by data sampling and quantization, and the chattering\nphenomena, which results in high frequency oscillations. One effective solution\nto minimize the effects of data sampling and quantization imprecisions is the\nuse of higher order sliding modes. To this end, in this paper, a new\nformulation of an adaptive second order discrete sliding mode control (DSMC) is\npresented for a general class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uncertain\nnonlinear systems. Based on a Lyapunov stability argument and by invoking the\nnew Invariance Principle, not only the asymptotic stability of the controller\nis guaranteed, but also the adaptation law is derived to remove the\nuncertainties within the nonlinear plant dynamics. The proposed adaptive\ntracking controller is designed and tested in real-time for a highly nonlinear\ncontrol problem in spark ignition combustion engine during transient operating\nconditions. The simulation and real-time processor-in-the-loop (PIL) test\nresults show that the second order single-input single-output (SISO) DSMC can\nimprove the tracking performances up to 90%, compared to a first order SISO\nDSMC under sampling and quantization imprecisions, in the presence of modeling\nuncertainties. Moreover, it is observed that by converting the engine SISO\ncontrollers to a MIMO structure, the overall controller performance can be\nenhanced by 25%, compared to the SISO second order DSMC, because of the\ndynamics coupling consideration within the MIMO DSMC formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 14:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

The present\nwork applies stochastic optimisation to the task of recursive estimation of a\nstatistical parameter which belongs to a Riemannian manifold. Roughly, this\ntask amounts to stochastic minimisation of a statistical divergence function.\nThe following problem is considered : how to obtain fast, asymptotically\nefficient, recursive estimates, using a Riemannian stochastic optimisation\nalgorithm with decreasing step sizes? In solving this problem, several original\nresults are introduced. First, without any convexity assumptions on the\ndivergence function, it is proved that, with an adequate choice of step sizes,\nthe algorithm computes recursive estimates which achieve a fast non-asymptotic\nrate of convergence. Second, the asymptotic normality of these recursive\nestimates is proved, by employing a novel linearisation technique. Third, it is\nproved that, when the Fisher information metric is used to guide the algorithm,\nthese recursive estimates achieve an optimal asymptotic rate of convergence, in\nthe sense that they become asymptotically efficient. These results, while\nrelatively familiar in the Euclidean context, are here formulated and proved\nfor the first time, in the Riemannian context.

We\nalso present a new evolution behavior of liquid jets not yet reported before\nthat the jet initially transforms into droplets and then becomes a\nuniform-radius jet again.

They guarantee an investigation of the entire input image for\nthe object to be detected and allow a localization of that object. Despite the\ncurrent trend towards deep neural networks, sliding window methods are still\nused in combination with convolutional neural networks. The risk of overlooking\nan object is clearly reduced compared to alternative detection approaches which\ndetect objects based on shape, edges or color. Nevertheless, the sliding window\ntechnique strongly increases the computational effort as the classifier has to\nverify a large number of object candidates. This paper proposes a sliding\nwindow approach which also uses depth information from a stereo camera. This\nleads to a greatly decreased number of object candidates without significantly\nreducing the detection accuracy. A theoretical investigation of the\nconventional sliding window approach is presented first. Other publications to\ndate only mentioned rough estimations of the computational cost.

The cloud's evolution is characterized by an initial increase in\nits mass, density, and star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE) as it\ncontracts, followed by a decrease of these quantities as newly formed massive\nstars begin to disrupt the cloud. The main parameter of the model is the\nmaximum mass reached by the cloud during its evolution. Thus, specifying the\ninstantaneous mass and some other variable completely determines the cloud's\nevolutionary stage. We apply the model to interpret the observed scatter in\nSFEs of the cloud sample compiled by Lada et al.\\ as an evolutionary effect so\nthat, although clouds such as California and Orion A have similar masses, they\nare in very different evolutionary stages, causing their very different\nobserved SFRs and SFEs. The model predicts that the California cloud will\neventually reach a significantly larger total mass than the Orion A cloud.\nNext, we apply the model to derive estimated ages of the clouds since the time\nwhen approximately 25\\% of their mass had become molecular. We find ages from\n$\\sim 1.5$ to 27 Myr, with the most inactive clouds being the youngest. Further\npredictions of the model are that clouds with very low SFEs should have massive\natomic envelopes constituting the majority of their gravitational mass, and\nthat low-mass clouds ($M \\sim 10^3$-$10^4 \\, M_\\odot$) end their lives with a\nmini-burst of star formation, reaching SFRs $\\sim 300$-$500\\, M_\\odot$\nMyr$^{-1}$.

The architecture embodies several crucial\nprinciples of general intelligence including diversity of representations,\ndiversity of data types, integrated memory, modularity, and higher-order\ncognition. We retain the basic design of a fundamental algorithmic substrate\ncalled an \"AI kernel\" for problem solving and basic cognitive functions like\nmemory, and a larger, modular architecture that re-uses the kernel in many\nways. Omega includes eight representation languages and six classes of neural\nnetworks, which are briefly introduced. The architecture is intended to\ninitially address data science automation, hence it includes many problem\nsolving methods for statistical tasks. We review the broad software\narchitecture, higher-order cognition, self-improvement, modular neural\narchitectures, intelligent agents, the process and memory hierarchy, hardware\nabstraction, peer-to-peer computing, and data abstraction facility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2018 22:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

Nanolithography uses Atomic Probe Microscope like\nprobes to deliver the ink drop on to the substrate. The model considers the ink\nto be molecular. Some models have been developed considering fluid ink, some\nwith thiol inks, particulate inks and polymer inks. The models consider the\nfluid ink with the added factors such as flow rate, detachment rate, effect due\nto relative humidity, multilayer flow, the ink drop, with meniscus etc., which\nmakes the model complicated.
