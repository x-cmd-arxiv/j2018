Many NMAs include only data from RCTs. However, real-world\nevidence (RWE) is also becoming widely recognised as a valuable source of\nclinical data. We investigate methods for the inclusion of RWE in NMA and its\nimpact on the uncertainty around the effectiveness estimates.\n  Methods: A range of methods for inclusion of RWE in evidence synthesis,\nincluding Bayesian hierarchical and power prior models, were investigated by\napplying them to an example in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The\neffect of the inclusion of RWE was investigated by varying the degree of down\nweighting of this part of evidence by the use of a power prior.\n  Results: Whilst the inclusion of the RWE led to an increase in the level of\nuncertainty surrounding effect estimates in this example, this depended on the\nmethod of inclusion adopted for the RWE. Power prior NMA model resulted in\nstable effect estimates for fingolimod yet increasing the width of the credible\nintervals with increasing weight given to RWE data. The hierarchical NMA models\nwere effective in allowing for heterogeneity between study designs; however,\nthis also increased the level of uncertainty.\n  Conclusion: The power prior approach for the inclusion of RWE in NMAs\nindicates that the degree to which RWE is taken into account can have a\nsignificant impact on the overall level of uncertainty. The hierarchical\nmodelling approach further allowed for accommodating differences between study\ntypes. Consequently, further work investigating both empirical evidence for\nbiases associated with individual RWE studies and methods of elicitation from\nexperts on the extent of such biases is warranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 16:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 09:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

This is much needed when we investigate heterogenous\ntreatment effects since interactions between the endogenous treatment and\ncontrol variables lead to an increased number of endogenous covariates. We\nprove that the GMM formulation of IVQR is NP-hard and finding an approximate\nsolution is also NP-hard. Hence, solving the problem from a purely\ncomputational perspective seems unlikely. Instead, we aim to obtain an estimate\nthat has good statistical properties and is not necessarily the global solution\nof any optimization problem.\n  The proposal consists of employing $k$-step correction on an initial\nestimate. The initial estimate exploits the latest advances in mixed integer\nlinear programming and can be computed within seconds. One theoretical\ncontribution is that such initial estimators and Jacobian of the moment\ncondition used in the k-step correction need not be even consistent and merely\n$k=4\\log n$ fast iterations are needed to obtain an efficient estimator. The\noverall proposal scales well to handle extremely large sample sizes because\nlack of consistency requirement allows one to use a very small subsample to\nobtain the initial estimate and the k-step iterations on the full sample can be\nimplemented efficiently.

A composite\nparticle in a new strong dynamics is a promising candidate for ADM as the\nstrong dynamics naturally explains the ADM mass in the GeV range. Its large\nannihilation cross section due to the strong dynamics leaves the asymmetric\ncomponent to be dominant over the symmetric component. In such composite ADM\nscenarios, the dark sector has a relatively large entropy density in the early\nUniverse. The large dark sector entropy results in the overclosure of the\nUniverse or at best contradicts with the observations of the cosmic microwave\nbackground and the successful Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. Thus, composite ADM\nmodels generically require some portal to transfer the entropy of the dark\nsector into the Standard Model sector. In this paper, we consider a dark photon\nportal with a mass in the sub-GeV range and kinetic mixing with the Standard\nModel photon. We investigate the viable parameter space of the dark photon in\ndetail, which can find broad applications to dark photon portal models.

This comet produced approximately half the CO that comet C/1995 O1\n(Hale-Bopp) did at 3 au. If CO production scales with nucleus surface area,\nthen the radius need not exceed ~15 km. The spectra and mapping data are\nconsistent with CO arising from a combination of a sunward-side active area and\nan isotropic source. For HCN, we calculated a 3-sigma upper limit production\nrate of Q(HCN) < 8x10$^{24}$ molecules s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to an\nextraordinarily high abundance ratio limit of Q(CO)/Q(HCN) > 5000. We inferred\na production rate of molecular nitrogen of Q(N$_2$) ~2.8x10$^{27}$ molecules\ns$^{-1}$ using our CO data and the reported N$_2$/CO column density ratio\n(Cochran & MacKay 2018a,b). The comet does not show the typical nitrogen\ndepletion seen in comets, and the CO-rich, N$_2$-rich and HCN-depleted values\nare consistent with formation in a cold environment of T < 50 K that may have\nprovided significant N$_2$ shielding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 18:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

In this paper, a novel secret\nkey generation method is proposed for IoTs that utilize the intrinsic\nrandomness embedded in the devices' memories introduced in the manufacturing\nprocess. A fuzzy extractor structure using serially concatenated BCH-Polar\ncodes is proposed to generate reproducible keys from a ReRAM-based\n\\emph{ternary-state} Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for device\nauthentication and secret key generation. The ReRAM based PUFs are the most\npractical choice for authentication and key generation in IoT, as they operate\nat or below the systems' noise level and therefore are less vulnerable to side\nchannel attacks compared to the alternative memory technologies. However, the\ncurrent ReRAM-based PUFs present a high false negative authentication rate\nsince the behavior of these devices can vary in different physical conditions\nthat results in a low probability of regenerating the same response in\ndifferent attempts.

The method requires the\ndirection of at least one $\\tau$ lepton to be well defined and therefore the\nmethod can be applied to the decays $Z/H \\rightarrow \\tau\\tau \\rightarrow X +\na_{1}\\nu$ with $a_{1}$ resonance decaying into three charged pions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 23:11:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 05:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

In this paper, we design a Multi-scale\nDeconvolutional Single Shot Detector (MDSSD), especially for small object\ndetection. In MDSSD, multiple high-level feature maps at different scales are\nupsampled simultaneously to increase the spatial resolution. Afterwards, we\nimplement the skip connections with low-level feature maps via Fusion Block.\nThe fusion feature maps, named Fusion Module, are of strong feature\nrepresentational power of small instances.

Based on the spatial\nreciprocity in a wireless channel, the downlink channel is reconstructed by\nusing frequency-independent parameters. We first estimate the gains, delays,\nand angles during uplink sounding. The gains are then refined through downlink\ntraining and sent back to the base station (BS). With limited overhead, the\nrefinement can substantially improve the accuracy of the downlink channel\nreconstruction. The BS can then reconstruct the downlink channel with the\nuplink-estimated delays and angles and the downlink-refined gains. We also\nintroduce and extend the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP)\nalgorithm to detect the delays and gains in a multi-antenna multi-subcarrier\ncondition. The results of our analysis show that the extended NOMP algorithm\nachieves high estimation accuracy.

Recently, we have demonstrated sub-0.2V II in NIPIN\ndiode experimentally primarily based on the steady-state analysis. In this\npaper, we present the detailed experimental transient behavior of SBG-II in\nNIPIN. The SBG-II generated holes are stored in the p-well. First, we extract\nthe leakage mechanism from the p-well to show two mechanisms (i)\nrecombination-generation (RG) and (ii) over the barrier (OTB) where OTB\ndominates when barrier height $ phy_b<0.59eV $. Second, we analytically extract\nthe SBG II current (Iii) at 300K from experimental results. The drain current\n(Id), the electric field (E-field), and Iii are plotted in time. We observe\nthat Iii increase as E-field reduces which indicates that E-field does not\nprimarily contribute to Iii. Further, the Id shows two distinct behaviors (i)\nIii (Id) is constant at the beginning and (ii) eventually universal Iii (Id) is\nlinear, i.e. Iii=k X Id where $ k=10^-3$; We also show that the electrons\nprimarily contributing to Id are directly incapable of II due to insufficient\nenergy $(<Eg)$. Fischetti's model showed that SBG-II is primarily caused by hot\nelectrons that accept energy in an Auger-like process from cold drain electrons\nto enable SBG-II. We speculate that if the Id electrons heat-up the cold drain\nelectrons, which would further energize the hot electrons to produce the\nobserved Iii (Id) universal dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 05:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

This material is highly thrombogenic, and plaque rupture can lead\nto the formation of blood clots that occlude major arteries and cause\nmyocardial infarction or stroke. In advanced plaques, vascular smooth muscle\ncells (SMCs) migrate from deeper in the artery wall to synthesise a cap of\nfibrous tissue that stabilises the plaque and sequesters the thrombogenic\nplaque content from the bloodstream. The fibrous cap provides crucial\nprotection against the clinical consequences of atherosclerosis, but the\nmechanisms of cap formation are poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear\nwhy certain plaques become stable and robust while others become fragile and\nvulnerable to rupture.\n  We develop a multiphase model with non-standard boundary conditions to\ninvestigate early fibrous cap formation in the atherosclerotic plaque. The\nmodel is parameterised using a range of in vitro and in vivo data, and includes\nhighly nonlinear mechanisms of SMC proliferation and migration in response to\nan endothelium-derived chemical signal. We demonstrate that the model SMC\npopulation naturally evolves towards a steady-state, and predict a rate of cap\nformation and a final plaque SMC content consistent with experimental\nobservations in mice. Parameter sensitivity simulations show that SMC\nproliferation makes a limited contribution to cap formation, and highlight that\nstable cap formation relies on a critical balance between SMC recruitment to\nthe plaque, SMC migration within the plaque and SMC loss by apoptosis. The\nmodel represents the first detailed in silico study of fibrous cap formation in\natherosclerosis, and establishes a multiphase modelling framework that can be\nreadily extended to investigate many other aspects of plaque development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 05:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

The observations were\nobtained over 14 nights, had a total duration of 56 hours and covered one year.\nThe large time span, during which we observed the eclipses, allowed us to\nmeasure the orbital period in IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0 with high precision,\nPorb=0.20603098+/-0.00000025 d. The prominent parts of the eclipses lasted\n0.1+/-0.01 phases or 30+/-3 min. The depth of the eclipses was variable in the\nrange 1.8-2.9 mag. The average eclipse depth was equal to 2.42+/-0.06 mag. The\nprominent parts of the eclipses revealed a smooth and symmetric shape. We\nderived the eclipse ephemeris, which, according to the precision of the orbital\nperiod, has a formal validity time of 500 years. This ephemeris can be useful\nfor future investigations of the long-term period changes. During the latter\nfour observational nights in 2017 January, we observed the sharp brightness\ndecrease of IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0 by 2.3 mag. This brightness decrease\nimitated the end of the dwarf nova outburst. However, the long-term light curve\nof IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0 obtained in the course of the Catalina Sky Survey\nduring 8 years showed no dwarf nova outbursts. From this we conclude that IPHAS\nJ051814.33+294113.0 is a novalike variable. Moreover, the sharp brightness\ndecrease, which we observed in IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0, suggests that this\nnovalike variable belongs to the VY Scl-subtype. Due to very deep eclipses,\nIPHAS J051814.33+294113.0 is suitable to study the accretion disc structure\nusing eclipse mapping techniques.

The other\ngiants are concentrated in close proximity to the RGB luminosity bump, the\ncore-He burning stages, or the early-AGB. This is very clear when looking at\nthe Gaia-based luminosities of the Li-rich giants. This is also seen when the\nCoRoT Li-rich giants are compared to a larger sample of 2252 giants observed in\nthe CoRoT fields by the Gaia-ESO Survey, which are distributed all over the RGB\nin the Teff-logg diagram. These observations show that evolutionary stage is a\nmajor factor behind the Li enrichment in giants. Other processes, like planet\naccretion, contribute to a smaller scale.

In order to cover a large class of applications, we consider the\ngeneral family of attributed graphs where both topology (number of vertexes and\nedge configuration) and related attributes are allowed to change also in the\nstationary case. Novel Change Point Methods (CPMs) are proposed, that (i) map\ngraphs into a vector domain; (ii) apply a suitable statistical test in the\nvector space; (iii) detect the change --if any-- according to a confidence\nlevel and provide an estimate for its time occurrence. Two specific\nmultivariate CPMs have been designed: one that detects shifts in the\ndistribution mean, the other addressing generic changes affecting the\ndistribution. We ground our proposal with theoretical results showing how to\nrelate the inference attained in the numerical vector space to the graph\ndomain, and vice versa.

The $Z_2$ flux excitation is pointlike in two dimensions, while it\ncomprises a closed loop in three dimensions because of the local constraint for\neach closed volume. In addition, the fluxes obey global constraints involving\n(semi)macroscopic number of fluxes. We here investigate such global constraints\nin the Kitaev model on a three-dimensional lattice composed of nine-site\nelementary loops, dubbed the hypernonagon lattice, whose ground state is a\nchiral spin liquid. We consider two different anisotropic limits of the\nhypernonagon Kitaev model where the low-energy effective models are described\nsolely by the $Z_2$ fluxes. We show that there are two kinds of global\nconstraints in the model defined on a three-dimensional torus, namely, surface\nand volume constraints: the surface constraint is imposed on the even-odd\nparity of the total number of fluxes threading a two-dimensional slice of the\nsystem, while the volume constraint is for the even-odd parity of the number of\nthe fluxes through specific plaquettes whose total number is proportional to\nthe system volume. In the two anisotropic limits, therefore, the elementary\nexcitation of $Z_2$ fluxes occurs in a pair of closed loops so as to satisfy\nboth two global constraints as well as the local constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 09:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

In\nthis contribution, we propose a novel metric learning approach for trees which\nlearns an edit distance indirectly by embedding the tree nodes as vectors, such\nthat the Euclidean distance between those vectors supports class\ndiscrimination. We learn such embeddings by reducing the distance to\nprototypical trees from the same class and increasing the distance to\nprototypical trees from different classes.

Unlike recent optomechanical systems, the optical modes are directly\ncoupled to the microwave cavity through the optoelectronic elements with no\nneed mechanical system. The main objective of this work is to generate the\nentangled modes at room temperature. For this purpose, we theoretically analyze\nthe dynamics of motion of the optoelectronic system with the\nHeisenberg-Langevin equations, from which one can calculate the coupling\nbetween optical and microcavity modes. The most important feature of this\nsystem is the coupling between optical mode and microwave cavity mode, which is\ndone using a photodetector and a Varactor diode.

Although the two\nproblems exhibit different computational complexity on split graphs, no similar\ncharacterization is known on other classes of graphs.

As a response, we make use of a strategy\npreviously developed in the machine learning literature (Bayesian optimisation\nfor likelihood-free inference, BOLFI), which combines Gaussian process\nregression of the discrepancy to build a surrogate surface with Bayesian\noptimisation to actively acquire training data. We extend the method by\nderiving an acquisition function tailored for the purpose of minimising the\nexpected uncertainty in the approximate posterior density, in the parametric\napproach. The resulting algorithm is applied to the problems of summarising\nGaussian signals and inferring cosmological parameters from the Joint\nLightcurve Analysis supernovae data.

The concept of ruling sets can naturally be extended\nto edges, i.e., a subset $F\\subseteq E$ is an $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-ruling edge set\nof a graph $G=(V,E)$ if the corresponding nodes form an $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-ruling\nset in the line graph of $G$. This paper presents a simple deterministic,\ndistributed algorithm, in the $\\mathsf{CONGEST}$ model, for computing\n$(2,2)$-ruling edge sets in $O(\\log^* n)$ rounds. Furthermore, we extend the\nalgorithm to compute ruling sets of graphs with bounded diversity. Roughly\nspeaking, the diversity of a graph is the maximum number of maximal cliques a\nvertex belongs to. We devise $(2,O(\\mathcal{D}))$-ruling sets on graphs with\ndiversity $\\mathcal{D}$ in $O(\\mathcal{D}+\\log^* n)$ rounds.

The most\nimportant characteristic of the numerical method is that it is directly applied\nto the nonlocal equation by introducing the discrete convolution operator.\nStarting from the continuous Cauchy problem defined on the real line, we first\nconstruct the discrete Cauchy problem on a uniform grid of the real line. Thus\nthe semi-discretization in space of the continuous problem gives rise to an\ninfinite system of ordinary differential equations in time. We show that the\ninitial-value problem for this system is well-posed. We prove that solutions of\nthe discrete problem converge uniformly to those of the continuous one as the\nmesh size goes to zero and that they are second-order convergent in space.

We introduce the\nNode-Capacitated Clique model as an abstract communication model, which allows\nus to study the effect of nodes having limited communication capacity on the\ncomplexity of distributed graph computations.

We evaluate our fixed-PSNR compressor on three real-world\nhigh-performance computing data sets.

A multitude of interrelated runtime\nmodels are employed simultaneously, and thus they have to be maintained at\nruntime. While for the development case megamodels have emerged to address the\nproblem of managing models and relations, the problem is rather neglected for\nthe case of runtime models by applying ad-hoc solutions. Therefore, we propose\nto utilize megamodel concepts for the case of multiple runtime models. Based on\nthe current state of research, we present a categorization of runtime models\nand conceivable relations between them. The categorization describes the role\nof interrelated models at runtime and demonstrates that several approaches\nalready employ multiple runtime models and relations. Then, we show how\nmegamodel concepts help in organizing and utilizing runtime models and\nrelations in a model-driven manner while supporting a high level of automation.\nFinally, the role of interrelated models and megamodels at runtime is discussed\nfor self-adaptive software systems and exemplified by a case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 17:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Once the adjoint solution is obtained, the\nsensitivities to any number of parameters can be obtained with little effort.\nThere are two methods to develop the adjoint equations: continuous method and\ndiscrete method. In the continuous method, the control theory is applied to the\nforward governing equation and produces an analytical partial differential\nequation for solving the adjoint variable; in the discrete method, the control\ntheory is applied to the discrete form of the forward governing equation and\nproduces a linear system of equations for solving the adjoint variable. In this\narticle, an adjoint sensitivity analysis framework is developed using both the\ncontinuous and discrete methods. These two methods are assessed with the faucet\nflow for steady-state problem and one transient test case based on the BFBT\nbenchmark for transient problem. Adjoint sensitivities from both methods are\nverified by sensitivities given by the perturbation method. Adjoint\nsensitivities from both methods are physically reasonable and match each.

To systematically address this interplay,\nruntime megamodels, which are specific runtime models that have themselves\nruntime models as their elements and that also capture the relationships\nbetween multiple runtime models, have been proposed. In this paper, we go one\nstep further and present a modeling language for runtime megamodels that\nconsiderably eases the development of the adaptation logic by providing a\ndomain-specific modeling approach and a runtime interpreter for this part of a\nself-adaptive system. This supports development by modeling the feedback loops\nexplicitly and at a higher level of abstraction.

The rate of these\ncancers in female rats is about one third the rate in male rats; the rate of\ngliomas in female humans is about two thirds the rate in male humans. Both of\nthese observations can be explained by a decrease in sensitivity to chemical\ncarcinogenesis in both female rats and female humans.
