In conjunction with carefully designed optical resonators, it\nis now possible to achieve extraordinary control of the properties of\nindividual photons, introducing tunable gauge fields whilst imbuing the photons\nwith mass and embedding them on curved spatial manifolds. Building on work\nformalizing Rydberg-mediated interactions between propagating photons, we\ndevelop a theory of interacting Rydberg polaritons in multimode optical\nresonators, where the strong interactions are married with tunable\nsingle-particle properties to build and probe exotic matter. In the presence of\nstrong coupling between the resonator field and a Rydberg-dressed atomic\nensemble, a quasiparticle called the \"cavity Rydberg polariton\" emerges.

A key issue is the proportion of the stellar ionizing\nradiation that escapes the galaxies in which it is produced. Spectroscopy of\ngamma-ray burst afterglows can be used to determine the neutral hydrogen\ncolumn-density in their host galaxies and hence the opacity to extreme\nultra-violet radiation along the lines-of-sight to the bursts. Thus, making the\nreasonable assumption that long-duration GRB locations are representative of\nthe sites of massive stars that dominate EUV production, one can calculate an\naverage escape fraction of ionizing radiation in a way that is independent of\ngalaxy size, luminosity or underlying spectrum. Here we present a sample of NH\nmeasures for 138 GRBs in the range 1.6<z<6.7 and use it to establish an average\nescape fraction at the Lyman limit of <fesc>~0.005, with a 98% confidence upper\nlimit of ~0.015. This analysis suggests that stars provide a small contribution\nto the ionizing radiation budget of the IGM at z<5, where the bulk of the\nbursts lie. At higher redshifts, z>5, firm conclusions are limited by the small\nsize of the GRB sample, but any decline in average HI column-density seems to\nbe modest. We also find no indication of a significant correlation of NH with\ngalaxy UV luminosity or host stellar mass, for the subset of events for which\nthese are available. We discuss in some detail a number of selection effects\nand potential biases. Drawing on a range of evidence we argue that such\neffects, while not negligible, are unlikely to produce systematic errors of\nmore than a factor ~2, and so would not affect the primary conclusions. Given\nthat many GRB hosts are low metallicity, high specific star-formation rate,\ndwarf galaxies, these results present a particular problem for the hypothesis\nthat such galaxies dominated the reionization of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 16:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Recently,\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods have achieved better\nperformance with comparison to the traditional methods.

By employing the mixup approach for data\nargumentation, the novel model can provide higher prediction accuracy and\nrobustness in contrast with previous models, while the generalization error can\nalso be reduced on the evaluation data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 16:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

Crystal structure at room\ntemperature was first confirmed to be L2$_1$ using the highly intense\nsynchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. Temperature dependent\nmagnetization reveals that Ga$_2$MnCo enters a ferromagnetic (FM) state at $T_C\n= $154 K, characterized by a sharp increase in magnetization and a plateau-like\nregion hereafter. As the temperature is decreased further, a sharp drop in\nmagnetization is observed at $T_f$ = 50 K, hinting towards an antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) phase change. Neutron diffraction (ND) recorded over the range of\ntemperature from 6 to 300 K, provides combined information regarding crystal as\nwell as magnetic structure. Accordingly, an increase in the intensity of the ND\npattern is seen at 150 K, signaling onset of long range FM order. However,\nthere is no sign of appearance of superlattice reflections corresponding to the\nAFM phase, in the patterns recorded below 50 K. An unusual discontinuity in the\nunit cell volume is seen around $T_f$ indicating a coupling of this second\ntransition with the contraction of the lattice. Attempts to unravel this\ninteresting magnetic behaviour using ac susceptibility measurements lead to the\nexistence of glassy magnetism below $T_f$. Systematic analysis of the\nsusceptibility results along with neutron depolarization measurement,\nidentifies the low temperature phase as a reentrant cluster glass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 16:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

Using virtual polynomials, we find an algebraic\nstructure for the loss surfaces, called semi-algebraic sets. We analyze these\nloss surfaces from the algebro-geometric point of view. Factorization of\npolynomials is one of the most standard ideas in algebra. Hence, we express the\nfactorization of the virtual polynomials in terms of their active paths. This\nframework can be applied to the leakage problem in the training of deep neural\nnetworks. The main theorem in this paper indicates that there are many risks\nassociated with the training of deep neural networks. For example, if we have N\n(the dimension of weight space) + 1 nonsmooth points on the loss surface, which\nare sufficiently close to each other, we can obtain the input of training\nsample up to scalar multiplication. We also point out that the structures of\nthe loss surfaces depend on the shape of the deep neural network and not on the\ntraining samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 17:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

The\napproach outlined in this thesis represents a paradigm shift away from that\ntraditional approach. I argue that perfect reconstructions are not only\nunnecessary for the purposes of delay-coordinate based forecasting, but that\nthey can often be less effective than reduced-order versions of those same\nmodels. I demonstrate this using a range of low- and high-dimensional dynamical\nsystems, showing that forecast models that employ imperfect reconstructions of\nthe dynamics---i.e., models that are not necessarily true embeddings---can\nproduce surprisingly accurate predictions of the future state of these systems.\nI develop a theoretical framework for understanding why this is so.

Though simple reshare cascades have been studied\nextensively, the full range of cascading behaviors on social media is much more\ndiverse. Here we study how diffusion protocols, or the social exchanges that\nenable information transmission, affect cascade growth, analogous to the way\ncommunication protocols define how information is transmitted from one point to\nanother. Studying 98 of the largest information cascades on Facebook, we find a\nwide range of diffusion protocols - from cascading reshares of images, which\nuse a simple protocol of tapping a single button for propagation, to the ALS\nIce Bucket Challenge, whose diffusion protocol involved individuals creating\nand posting a video, and then nominating specific others to do the same. We\nfind recurring classes of diffusion protocols, and identify two key\ncounterbalancing factors in the construction of these protocols, with\nimplications for a cascade's growth: the effort required to participate in the\ncascade, and the social cost of staying on the sidelines. Protocols requiring\ngreater individual effort slow down a cascade's propagation, while those\nimposing a greater social cost of not participating increase the cascade's\nadoption likelihood. The predictability of transmission also varies with\nprotocol. But regardless of mechanism, the cascades in our analysis all have a\nsimilar reproduction number ($\\approx$ 1.8), meaning that lower rates of\nexposure can be offset with higher per-exposure rates of adoption. Last, we\nshow how a cascade's structure can not only differentiate these protocols, but\nalso be modeled through branching processes.

In this study we used an objective health indicator, namely\nantidepressant prescription rates. Current studies rely exclusively upon mean\nregression models assuming linear associations. It is, however, plausible that\nthe presence of green space is non-linearly related with different quantiles of\nthe outcome antidepressant prescription rates. These restrictions may\ncontribute to inconsistent findings. Our aim was to assess antidepressant\nprescription rates in relation to green space, and to analyze how the\nrelationship varies non-linearly across different quantiles of antidepressant\nprescription rates. We used cross-sectional data for the year 2014 at a\nmunicipality level in the Netherlands. Ecological Bayesian geoadditive quantile\nregressions were fitted for the 15, 50, and 85 percent quantiles to estimate\ngreen space-prescription rate correlations, controlling for confounders. The\nresults suggested that green space was overall inversely and non-linearly\nassociated with antidepressant prescription rates. More important, the\nassociations differed across the quantiles, although the variation was modest.\nSignificant non-linearities were apparent: The associations were slightly\npositive in the lower quantile and strongly negative in the upper one. Our\nfindings imply that an increased availability of green space within a\nmunicipality may contribute to a reduction in the number of antidepressant\nprescriptions dispensed. Green space is thus a central health and community\nasset, whilst a minimum level of 28 percent needs to be established for health\ngains. The highest effectiveness occurred at a municipality surface percentage\nhigher than 79 percent. This inverse dose-dependent relation has important\nimplications for setting future community-level health and planning policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 18:55:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 20:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 05:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

Recently, it was proposed by\nBell & Cowan (2018) that the heat intake to dissociate hydrogen and heat\nrelease due to recombination of dissociated hydrogen can affect the atmospheric\ncirculation of ultra-hot Jupiters. In this work, we add cooling/heating due to\ndissociation/recombination into the analytic theory of Komacek & Showman (2016)\nand Zhang & Showman (2017) for the dayside-nightside temperature contrasts of\nhot Jupiters. We find that at high values of incident stellar flux, the\nday-night temperature contrast of ultra-hot Jupiters may decrease with\nincreasing incident stellar flux due to dissociation/recombination, the\nopposite of that expected without including the effects of\ndissociation/recombination. We propose that a combination of a greater number\nof full-phase light curve observations of ultra-hot Jupiters and future General\nCirculation Models that include the effects of dissociation/recombination could\ndetermine in detail how the atmospheric circulation of ultra-hot Jupiters\ndiffers from that of cooler planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 19:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

For this\nmetric, the positions of the bits are not relevant to the decoding, and in many\nnoise models, not relevant to the BER either. In many applications this is\nunsatisfactory as typically all bits are not equal and have different\nsignificance. We consider the problem of bit error correction and mitigation\nwhere bits in different positions have different importance. For error\ncorrection, we look at ECC from a Bayesian perspective and introduce Bayes\nestimators with general loss functions to take into account the bit\nsignificance. We propose ECC schemes that optimize this error metric. As the\nproblem is highly nonlinear, traditional ECC construction techniques are not\napplicable. Using exhaustive search is cost prohibitive, and thus we use\niterative improvement search techniques to find good codebooks. We optimize\nboth general codebooks and linear codes. We provide numerical experiments to\nshow that they can be superior to classical linear block codes such as Hamming\ncodes and decoding methods such as minimum distance decoding.\n  For error mitigation, we study the case where ECC is not possible or not\ndesirable, but significance aware encoding of information is still beneficial\nin reducing the average error.

However, its i.i.d. assumption neglects the\nstructural regularity present in natural images. Various attempts have been\nmade to incorporate structural reasoning mostly through structure priors in a\ncooperative way where co-occurring patterns are encouraged.\n  We, on the other hand, approach this problem from an opposing angle and\npropose a new framework, Adversarial Structure Matching (ASM), for training\nsuch structured prediction networks via an adversarial process, in which we\ntrain a structure analyzer that provides the supervisory signals, the ASM loss.\nThe structure analyzer is trained to maximize the ASM loss, or to emphasize\nrecurring multi-scale hard negative structural mistakes among co-occurring\npatterns. On the contrary, the structured prediction network is trained to\nreduce those mistakes and is thus enabled to distinguish fine-grained\nstructures. As a result, training structured prediction networks using ASM\nreduces contextual confusion among objects and improves boundary localization.\nWe demonstrate that our ASM outperforms pixel-wise IID loss or structural prior\nGAN loss on three different structured prediction tasks: semantic segmentation,\nmonocular depth estimation, and surface normal prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 22:03:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 16:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

By studying how individual neural\nnodes behave in online training, we recognize that the global nature of ReLU\ngates can cause undesirable learning interference in each node's learning\nbehavior. We propose reducing such interferences with two efficient input\ntransformation methods that are geometric in nature and match well the\ngeometric property of ReLU gates. The first one is tile coding, a classic\nbinary encoding scheme originally designed for local generalization based on\nthe topological structure of the input space. The second one (EmECS) is a new\nmethod we introduce; it is based on geometric properties of convex sets and\ntopological embedding of the input space into the boundary of a convex set. We\ndiscuss the behavior of the network when it operates on the transformed inputs.\nWe also compare it experimentally with some neural nets that do not use the\nsame input transformations, and with the classic algorithm of tile coding plus\na linear function approximator, and on several online reinforcement learning\ntasks, we show that the neural net with tile coding or EmECS can achieve not\nonly faster learning but also more accurate approximations. Our results\nstrongly suggest that geometric input transformation of this type can be\neffective for interference reduction and takes us a step closer to fully\nincremental reinforcement learning with neural nets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 23:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 21:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-10"}

Although the entropy extractor can be lightweight,\nthe overhead of the secure sketch responsible correcting naturally noisy PUF\nresponses is usually costly. We observe that, in general, response\nunreliability with respect to a enrolled reference measurement increases with\nincreasing differences between the in-the-field PUF operating condition and the\noperating condition used in evaluating the enrolled reference response.

The critical observation here is\nthat one of the reference operating conditions is likely to be closer to the\noperating condition of the field deployed PUF, thus, resulting in minimizing\nthe expected unreliability when compared to the single reference under the\nnominal condition. Overall, MRR greatly reduces the demand for the expected\nnumber of erroneous bits for correction and, subsequently, achieve a\nsignificant reduction in the error correction overhead.

This parametrization is based on numerical\nhydrodynamical simulations and is more realistic than the simple linear\nparametrization widely used in previous analytic studies. We find that\nnonlinear eccentricity damping can significantly influence the stability and\noutcome of resonance capture. In particular, the equilibrium eccentricity of\nthe planet captured into MMRs become larger, and the captured MMR state tends\nto be more stable compared to the prediction based on the simple migration\nmodel. In addition, when the migration is sufficiently fast or/and the planet\nmass ratio is sufficiently small, we observe a novel phenomenon of eccentricity\novershoot, where the planet's eccentricity becomes very large before settling\ndown to the lower equilibrium value.

Specifically, stochastic fluctuations\ndrive a system to explore a range of configurations providing `raw' information\nfor a learning algorithm to construct an accurate model; yet they also blur\nenergetic differences between network states and thereby degrade information.\nThis competition leads spin networks to generically have an intrinsic optimal\ntemperature at which stochastic spin fluctuations provide maximal information\nfor discriminating among competing models, maximizing inference efficiency. We\ndemonstrate a simple active learning protocol that optimizes network\ntemperature to boost inference efficiency and dramatically increases the\nefficiency of inference on a neural circuit reconstruction task. Our results\nreveal a fundamental link between physics and information and show how the\nphysical environment can be tuned to optimize the efficiency of machine\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 04:30:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 06:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 17:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-17"}

By reformulating the\nstandard F-measure we propose the relaxed F-measure which is differentiable\nw.r.t the posterior and can be easily appended to the back of CNNs as the loss\nfunction. Compared to the conventional cross-entropy loss of which the\ngradients decrease dramatically in the saturated area, our loss function, named\nFLoss, holds considerable gradients even when the activation approaches the\ntarget. Consequently, the FLoss can continuously force the network to produce\npolarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets\nshow that FLoss outperforms the state-of-the-art with a considerable margin.\nMore specifically, due to the polarized predictions, our method is able to\nobtain high-quality saliency maps without carefully tuning the optimal\nthreshold, showing significant advantages in real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 10:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 10:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

For example, a digit-recognition model should be applicable\nto hand-written digits, house numbers, car plates, etc. Therefore, an ideal\nmodel for cloud computing has to perform well at each applicable domain. To\naddress this new challenge from cloud computing, we develop a framework of\nrobust optimization over multiple domains. In lieu of minimizing the empirical\nrisk, we aim to learn a model optimized to the adversarial distribution over\nmultiple domains. Hence, we propose to learn the model and the adversarial\ndistribution simultaneously with the stochastic algorithm for efficiency.\nTheoretically, we analyze the convergence rate for convex and non-convex\nmodels. To our best knowledge, we first study the convergence rate of learning\na robust non-convex model with a practical algorithm.

Identifying a binary\nwithin a PN offers a powerful tool with which to directly investigate the\nformation mechanisms behind these features. The Etched Hourglass Nebula, MyCn\n18, is the archetype for several binary-linked morphological features, yet it\nhas no identified binary nucleus. It has the fastest jets seen in a PN of 630\nkm s$^{-1}$, a central star position offset from the nebula centre, and a\nbipolar nebula with a very narrow waist. Here we report on the Southern African\nLarge Telescope (SALT) High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) detection of radial\nvelocity variability in the nucleus of MyCn 18 with an orbital period of\n$18.15\\pm0.04$ days and a semi-amplitude of $11.0\\pm0.3$ km s$^{-1}$. Adopting\nan orbital inclination of $38\\pm5$ deg and a primary mass of $0.6\\pm0.1$\n$M_\\odot$ yields a secondary mass of $0.19\\pm0.05$ $M_\\odot$ corresponding to\nan M5V companion. The detached nature of the binary rules out a classical nova\n(CN) as the origin of the jets or the offset central star as hypothesised in\nthe literature.

Thus by enabling the DDU to maximise its efficiency in\nreviewing its resources and works allocations, patients will benefit from more\nnew treatments faster. Conclusion. Management of organisations can be benefit\nfrom the process mining methodologies. Disco is excellent for non-experts on\nmanagement purposes. ProM is great for expert on research purposes. However,\nthe process mining is not once and for all but is a regular operation\nmanagement process. Indeed, event logs needs to be understand more on the\ntarget organisational behaviours and organisational business process. The\nresearchers have to be aware that event logs data are the most important and\npriority elements in process mining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 17:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Namely, having calculated the gradient at\nthe point on the manifold representing the model parameters, the updated point\nis obtained by travelling along the geodesic passing in the direction of the\ngradient. Some recent works employing optimisation in hyperbolic space have not\nattempted this procedure, however, employing instead various approximations to\navoid a calculation that was considered to be too complicated. In this\ntutorial, we demonstrate that in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space, the\nnecessary calculations to perform gradient descent are in fact\nstraight-forward. The advantages of the approach are then both illustrated and\nquantified for the optimisation problem of computing the Fr\\'echet mean (i.e.\nbarycentre) of points in hyperbolic space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 22:15:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 15:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

By\ncombining both linear and nonlinear terms, this tracking differentiator shows\nbetter dynamical performances than other conventional differentiators do. The\nhyperbolic tangent tanh(.) function is introduced due to two reasons; firstly,\nthe high slope of the continuous tanh(.) function near the origin significantly\naccelerates the convergence of the proposed tracking differentiator and reduces\nthe chattering phenomenon. Secondly, the saturation feature of the function due\nto its nonlinearity increases the robustness against the noise components in\nthe signal. The stability of the suggested tracking differentiator is proven\nbased on the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a frequency-based analysis is\napplied to investigate the dynamical performances. The performance of the\nproposed tracking differentiator has been tested in active disturbance\nrejection control (ADRC) paradigm, which is a recent robust control technique.\nThe numerical simulations emphasize the expected improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 00:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

The relay\ntechnology will play an important role in UAV networks by helping drones\ncommunicating with long-distance drones, which solves the problem of the\nlimited transmission power of drones. In this paper, the relay selection is\nseen as the entry point to improve the performance of self-organizing network\nwith multiple optimizing factors. Different from the ground relay models, the\nrelay selection in UAV communication networks presents new challenges,\nincluding heterogeneous, dynamic, dense and limited information\ncharacteristics. More effective schemes with distributed, fast, robust and\nscalable features are required to solve the optimizing problem. After\ndiscussing the challenges and requirements, we find that the matching game is\nsuitable to model the complex relay model. The advantages of the matching game\nin self-organizing UAV communications are discussed. Moreover, we provide\nextensive applications of matching markets, and then propose a novel\nclassification of matching game which focuses on the competitive relationship\nbetween players. Specifically, basic preliminary models are presented and some\nfuture research directions of matching game in UAV relay models are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 01:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

It is developed using the following first principles: (1)\nAnisotropy of the one-way speed of light in an inertial frame is due to its\nmotion with respect to the privileged frame; (2) Space-time transformations\nbetween inertial frames leave the equation of anisotropic light propagation\ninvariant; (3) A set of the transformations possesses a group structure. The\nLie group theory apparatus is applied to define groups of transformations. The\ncorrespondingly modified general relativity (GR), like the standard GR, is\nbased on the equivalence principle but with the properly modified space-time\nlocal symmetry in which an invariant combination differs from the Minkowski\ninterval of the standard SR. Applying the modified GR to cosmology yields the\nluminosity distance -- redshift relation corrected such that the observed\ndeceleration parameter can be negative as it was derived from the data for type\nIa supernovae. Thus, the observed negative values of the deceleration parameter\ncan be explained without introducing the dark energy.
