To this\nend, we propose to learn a group of capsule subspaces onto which an input\nfeature vector is projected. Then the lengths of resultant capsules are used to\nscore the probability of belonging to different classes. We train such a\nCapsule Projection Network (CapProNet) by learning an orthogonal projection\nmatrix for each capsule subspace, and show that each capsule subspace is\nupdated until it contains input feature vectors corresponding to the associated\nclass. We will also show that the capsule projection can be viewed as\nnormalizing the multiple columns of the weight matrix simultaneously to form an\northogonal basis, which makes it more effective in incorporating novel\ncomponents of input features to update capsule representations. In other words,\nthe capsule projection can be viewed as a multi-dimensional weight\nnormalization in capsule subspaces, where the conventional weight normalization\nis simply a special case of the capsule projection onto 1D lines. Only a small\nnegligible computing overhead is incurred to train the network in\nlow-dimensional capsule subspaces or through an alternative hyper-power\niteration to estimate the normalization matrix.

The goal of tsBART is\nto introduce smoothness over a single target covariate t, while not necessarily\nrequiring smoothness over other covariates x. TsBART is based on the Bayesian\nAdditive Regression Trees (BART) model, an ensemble of regression trees. TsBART\nextends BART by parameterizing each tree's terminal nodes with smooth functions\nof t, rather than independent scalars. Like BART, tsBART captures complex\nnonlinear relationships and interactions among the predictors. But unlike BART,\ntsBART guarantees that the response surface will be smooth in the target\ncovariate. This improves interpretability and helps regularize the estimate.\n  After introducing and benchmarking the tsBART model, we apply it to our\nmotivating example: pregnancy outcomes data from the National Center for Health\nStatistics. Our aim is to provide patient-specific estimates of stillbirth risk\nacross gestational age (t), based on maternal and fetal risk factors (x).\nObstetricians expect stillbirth risk to vary smoothly over gestational age, but\nnot necessarily over other covariates, and tsBART has been designed precisely\nto reflect this structural knowledge.

To reduce such cache thrashing, we\nmay adopt cache locality-aware warp scheduling which gives higher execution\npriority to warps with higher potential of data locality. However, we observe\nthat warps with high potential of data locality often incurs far more cache\nthrashing or interference than warps with low potential of data locality.\nConsequently, cache locality-aware warp scheduling may undesirably increase\ncache interference and/or unnecessarily decrease TLP.

Furthermore, self-propulsive dynamics\nspontaneously mobilise finite mechanisms as exemplified by a self-propelled\ntopological soliton. Non-equilibrium activity thus enables autonomous actuation\nof coordinated mechanisms engineered through network topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 08:17:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 10:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

Exploring the\nregular information and identifying the roles of microscopic elements in\nnetwork data can help us recognize the principle of network organization and\ncontribute to network data utilization. However, the intrinsic structural\nproperties of networks remain so far inadequately explored and theorised. With\nthe realistic assumption that there are consistent features across the local\nstructures of networks, we propose a low-rank pursuit based self-representation\nnetwork model, in which the principle of network organization can be uncovered\nby a representation matrix. According to this model, original true networks can\nbe reconstructed based on the observed unreliable network topology. In\nparticular, the proposed model enables us to estimate the extent to which the\nnetworks are regulable, i.e., measuring the reconstructability of networks. In\naddition, the model is capable of measuring the importance of microscopic\nnetwork elements, i.e., nodes and links, in terms of network regularity thereby\nallowing us to regulate the reconstructability of networks based on them.\nExtensive experiments on disparate real-world networks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed network reconstruction and regulation algorithm.\nSpecifically, the network regularity metric can reflect the reconstructability\nof networks, and the reconstruction accuracy can be improved by removing\nirregular network links. Lastly, our approach provides an unique and novel\ninsight into the organization exploring of complex networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 09:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 02:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

The proposed method tunes the two gains of STA on line\nsimultaneously such that a second order sliding mode can take place with small\nrectifying gains. The perturbation magnitude is obtained exactly by employing a\nthird-order sliding mode observer in opposition to the conventional\napproximations by using a first order low pass filter. While driving the\nsliding variable to the sliding mode surface, one gain of the STA automatically\nconverges to an adjacent area of the perturbation magnitude in finite time. The\nother gain is adjusted by the above gain to guarantee the robustness of the\nSTA. This method requires only one parameter to be adjusted. The adjustment is\nstraightforward because it just keeps increasing until it fulfills the\nconvergence constraints. For large values of the parameter, chattering in the\nupdate law of the two gains is avoided by employing a geometry based backward\nEuler integration method. The usefulness is illustrated by an example of\ndesigning an equivalent control based sliding mode control (ECBC-SMC) with the\nproposed adaptive STA for a perturbed LTI system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 12:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Furthermore,\nthe resulting policy is more interpretable than policies that directly map\nimages to actions or values with a black box neural network. We can gain\ninsight into the policy by inspecting the segmentation and motion of each\nobject detected by the agent. This allows practitioners to confirm whether a\npolicy is making decisions based on sensible information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 15:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Altogether, our theory, algorithms, and\nempirical results provide a full solution for the multiple-source adaptation\nproblem with very practical benefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 03:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

Video content caching at edge servers also reduces traffic in the\nbackhaul of the mobile network, hence reducing operational costs for mobile\nnetwork operators (MNOs). However, minimizing the rate of cache misses and\nmaximizing the average video quality may sometimes be at odds with each other,\nparticularly when the cache size is constrained. Our objective in this article\nis two fold: First, we explore the impact of fixed video content caching on the\noptimal QoE of mobile clients in a setup where servers at mobile network edge\nhandle bitrate selection. Second, we want to investigate the effect of cache\nreplacement on QoE-traffic trade-off. An integer nonlinear programming (INLP)\noptimization model is formulated for the problem of jointly maximizing the QoE,\nthe fairness as well as minimizing overall data traffic on the origin video\nserver. Due to its NP-Hardness, we then present a low complexity greedy-based\nalgorithm with minimum need for parameter tuning which can be easily deployed.\nWe show through simulations that the joint optimization indeed enables striking\na desired trade-off between traffic reduction and QoE. The results also reveal\nthat with fixed cached contents, the impact of caching on the QoE is\nproportional to the desired operational point of MNO. Furthermore, the effect\nof cache replacement on QoE is less noticeable compared to its effect on\nbackhaul traffic when cache size is constrained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2018 18:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

We test it on two tasks,\ndevised precisely to assess the compositional capabilities of neural models,\nand we show that vanilla sequence to sequence models with attention overfit the\ntraining distribution, while the guided versions come up with compositional\nsolutions that fit the training and testing distributions almost equally well.\nMoreover, the learned solutions generalise even in cases where the training and\ntesting distributions strongly diverge.

To train an RNN for multi-step\nprediction of dynamic systems, it is crucial to efficiently address the state\ninitialization problem, which seeks proper values for the RNN initial states at\nthe beginning of each prediction interval. In this work, the state\ninitialization problem is addressed using Neural Networks (NNs) to effectively\ntrain a variety of RNNs for modeling two aerial vehicles, a helicopter and a\nquadrotor, from experimental data. It is shown that the RNN initialized by the\nNN-based initialization method outperforms the state of the art. Further, a\ncomprehensive study of RNNs trained for multi-step prediction of the two aerial\nvehicles is presented. The multi-step prediction of the quadrotor is enhanced\nusing a hybrid model which combines a simplified physics-based motion model of\nthe vehicle with RNNs. While the maximum translational and rotational\nvelocities in the quadrotor dataset are about 4 m/s and 3.8 rad/s,\nrespectively, the hybrid model produces predictions, over 1.9 second, which\nremain within 9 cm/s and 0.12 rad/s of the measured translational and\nrotational velocities, with 99\\% confidence on the test dataset\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 00:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}
