Namely, only the sign of each measurement is available to us. In\nmany applications, the ground-truth signal is not sparse itself, but can be\nrepresented in a redundant dictionary. A strong line of research has addressed\nconventional CS in this signal model including its extension to one-bit\nmeasurements. However, one-bit CS suffers from the extremely large number of\nrequired measurements to achieve a predefined reconstruction error level. A\ncommon alternative to resolve this issue is to exploit adaptive schemes.\nAdaptive sampling acts on the acquired samples to trace the signal in an\nefficient way. In this work, we utilize an adaptive sampling strategy to\nrecover dictionary-sparse signals from binary measurements. For this task, a\nmulti-dimensional threshold is proposed to incorporate the previous signal\nestimates into the current sampling procedure. This strategy substantially\nreduces the required number of measurements for exact recovery. Our proof\napproach is based on the recent tools in high dimensional geometry in\nparticular random hyperplane tessellation and Gaussian width. We show through\nrigorous and numerical analysis that the proposed algorithm considerably\noutperforms state of the art approaches. Further, our algorithm reaches an\nexponential error decay in terms of the number of quantized measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 16:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 08:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 06:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2019 10:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

The problem of\nteaching to improve agent learning has been investigated by prior works, but\nthese approaches make assumptions that prevent application of teaching to\ngeneral multiagent problems, or require domain expertise for problems they can\napply to. This learning to teach problem has inherent complexities related to\nmeasuring long-term impacts of teaching that compound the standard multiagent\ncoordination challenges. In contrast to existing works, this paper presents the\nfirst general framework and algorithm for intelligent agents to learn to teach\nin a multiagent environment.

This new operation - called subnet prune and regraft (SNPR) - induces\na metric on the space of all phylogenetic networks as well as on several\nwidely-used network classes. In this paper, we investigate several problems\nthat arise in the context of computing the SNPR-distance. For a phylogenetic\ntree $T$ and a phylogenetic network $N$, we show how this distance can be\ncomputed by considering the set of trees that are embedded in $N$ and then use\nthis result to characterise the SNPR-distance between $T$ and $N$ in terms of\nagreement forests. Furthermore, we analyse properties of shortest\nSNPR-sequences between two phylogenetic networks $N$ and $N'$, and answer the\nquestion whether or not any of the classes of tree-child, reticulation-visible,\nor tree-based networks isometrically embeds into the class of all phylogenetic\nnetworks under SNPR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 23:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 23:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

A BC framework has been developed to achieve global coordination\ntasks with low communication volume. The BC law uses broadcast communication,\nwhich transmits an identical signal to all agents indiscriminately without any\nagent-to-agent communication. Unfortunately, all of the agents are required to\ntake numerous random actions because the BC law is based on stochastic\noptimization. Such random actions degrade the control performance for\ncoordination tasks and may invoke dangerous situations. In order to overcome\nthese drawbacks, the present paper proposes the pseudo-perturbation-based\nbroadcast control (PBC) law, which introduces multiple virtual random actions\ninstead of the single physical action of the BC law. The following advantages\nof the PBC law are theoretically proven. The PBC law achieves coordination\ntasks asymptotically with probability 1. Compared with the BC law, unavailing\nactions are reduced and agents' states converge at least twice as fast.\nIncreasing the number of multiple actions further improves the control\nperformance because averaging multiple actions reduces unavailing randomness.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate that the PBC improves the control performance\nas compared with the BC law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 23:57:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

To\ninvestigate this behaviour further and bridge the fields of granular matter and\nmaterials science, we simulated mono-disperse spheres confined in cylindrical\ncontainers to study their structural dynamics during vibration. By applying\nadequate vibration, disorder-to-order transitions were induced. Such\ntransitions were characterised at the particle scale through bond orientation\norder parameters. As a result, emergent crystallisation was indicated by the\nenhancement of the local order of individual particles and the number of\nordered particles. The observed heterogeneous crystallisation was characterised\nby the evolution of the spatial distributions via coarse-graining the order\nindex. Crystalline regimes epitaxially grew from templates formed near the\ncontainer walls during vibration, here termed the wall effect.

To answer this question, we propose SmoothOut framework to\nsmooth out sharp minima in DNNs and thereby improve generalization. In a\nnutshell, SmoothOut perturbs multiple copies of the DNN by noise injection and\naverages these copies. Injecting noises to SGD is widely used in the\nliterature, but SmoothOut differs in lots of ways: (1) a de-noising process is\napplied before parameter updating; (2) noise strength is adapted to filter\nnorm; (3) an alternative interpretation on the advantage of noise injection,\nfrom the perspective of sharpness and generalization; (4) usage of uniform\nnoise instead of Gaussian noise. We prove that SmoothOut can eliminate sharp\nminima. Training multiple DNN copies is inefficient, we further propose an\nunbiased stochastic SmoothOut which only introduces the overhead of noise\ninjecting and de-noising per batch. An adaptive variant of SmoothOut,\nAdaSmoothOut, is also proposed to improve generalization.

Our\ninterest here is to determine fundamental quantum limits to the achievable\nmultiparameter estimation precision in the presence of noise.

Recently the\nimportance of observing the MeV gamma-ray band to conclusively determine the\norigin has been remarked.

We find that the\nradial profile of 21-cm differential brightness temperature is quite sensitive\nto the stellar and halo masses, which reflects the time evolution of the escape\nfraction. In the case of a less massive star, ionizing photons hardly escape\nfrom its host halo due to the absorption by dense halo gas, thus an deep 21-cm\nabsorption feature at just outside the halo lasts a long time.

The best\nway to reduce message costs is by communicating without sending any messages\nwhatsoever. This paper initiates a rigorous investigation into the use of\nsilence in synchronous settings, in which processes can fail. We formalize\nsufficient conditions for information transfer using silence, as well as\nnecessary conditions for particular cases of interest. This allows us to\nidentify message patterns that enable communication through silence.

Since the frequencies of the resonant transitions are independent of\npotential modulation depth, in contrast to frequencies at which suppression of\ntunneling occurs, by varying this depth one can dynamically control both\nspatial localization and pseudo-spin of the final state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 09:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

In analogy with the standard theory of accretion discs, our theory is\nbased on shear viscous forces among nested annuli of gas. However, the fact\nthat gas follows non circular orbits in an external barred potential has\nprofound consequences: it creates a region of reverse shear in which it is\nenergetically favourable to form a stable ring which does not spread despite\ndissipation. Our theory allows us to approximately predict the size of the ring\ngiven the underlying gravitational potential. The size of the ring is loosely\nrelated to the location of the Inner Lindblad Resonance in the epicyclic\napproximation, but the predicted location is more accurate and is also valid\nfor strongly barred potentials. By comparing analytical predictions with the\nresults of hydrodynamical simulations, we find that our theory provides a\nviable mechanism for ring formation if the effective sound speed of the gas is\nlow ($\\cs\\lesssim1\\kms$), but that nuclear spirals/shocks created by pressure\ndestroy the ring when the sound speed is high ($\\cs\\simeq10\\kms$). We conclude\nthat whether this mechanism for ring formation is relevant for real galaxies\nultimately depends on the effective equation of state of the ISM. Promising\nconfirmation comes from simulations in which the ISM is modelled using\nstate-of-the-art cooling functions coupled to live chemical networks, but more\ntests are needed regarding the role of turbulence driven by stellar feedback.\nIf the mechanism is relevant in real galaxies, it could provide a powerful tool\nto constrain the gravitational potential, in particular the bar pattern speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 10:17:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

The use of efficient loop scheduling techniques in\ncomputationally-intensive applications is crucial for improving their\nperformance on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. A number of dynamic\nloop scheduling (DLS) techniques have been proposed between the late 1980s and\nearly 2000s, and efficiently used in scientific applications. In most cases,\nthe computing systems on which they have been tested and validated are no\nlonger available. This work is concerned with the minimization of the sources\nof uncertainty in the implementation of DLS techniques to avoid unnecessary\ninfluences on the performance of scientific applications. Therefore, it is\nimportant to ensure that the DLS techniques employed in scientific applications\ntoday adhere to their original design goals and specifications. The goal of\nthis work is to attain and increase the trust in the implementation of DLS\ntechniques in present studies. To achieve this goal, the performance of a\nselection of scheduling experiments from the 1992 original work that introduced\nfactoring is reproduced and predicted via both, simulative and native\nexperimentation. The experiments show that the simulation reproduces the\nperformance achieved on the past computing platform and accurately predicts the\nperformance achieved on the present computing platform. The performance\nreproduction and prediction confirm that the present implementation of the DLS\ntechniques considered both, in simulation and natively, adheres to their\noriginal description. The results confirm the hypothesis that reproducing\nexperiments of identical scheduling scenarios on past and modern hardware leads\nto an entirely different behavior from expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 11:46:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 16:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

Unlike conventional radio frequency wireless systems, the OWC\nchannel is not isotropic, meaning that the device orientation affects the\nchannel gain significantly, particularly for mobile users. However, due to the\nlack of a proper model for device orientation, many studies have assumed that\nthe receiver is vertically upward and fixed. In this paper, a novel model for\ndevice orientation based on experimental measurements of forty participants has\nbeen proposed. It is shown that the probability density function (PDF) of the\npolar angle can be modeled either based on a Laplace (for static users) or a\nGaussian (for mobile users) distribution. In addition, a closed-form expression\nis obtained for the PDF of the cosine of the incidence angle based on which\nline-of-sight (LOS) channel gain is described in OWC channels. An approximation\nof this PDF based on the truncated Laplace is proposed and the accuracy of this\napproximation is confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (KSD). Moreover,\nthe statistics of the LOS channel gain are calculated and the random\norientation of a user equipment (UE) is modeled as a random process. The\ninfluence of the random orientation on signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) performance\nof OWC systems has been evaluated. Finally, an orientation-based random\nwaypoint (ORWP) mobility model is proposed by considering the random\norientation of the UE during the user's movement. The performance of ORWP is\nassessed on the handover rate and it is shown that it is important to take the\nrandom orientation into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 11:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 17:51:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 18:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 14:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

It consists of training an undirected neural\nnetwork to map input to output and vice-versa; therefore it can produce a\nclassifier in one direction, and a generator in the opposite direction for the\nsame data. The learning process of BL tries to reproduce the neuroplasticity\nstated in Hebbian theory using only backward propagation of errors. In this\npaper, two novel learning techniques are introduced which use BL for improving\nrobustness to white noise static and adversarial examples. The first method is\nbidirectional propagation of errors, which the error propagation occurs in\nbackward and forward directions. Motivated by the fact that its generative\nmodel receives as input a constant vector per class, we introduce as a second\nmethod the hybrid adversarial networks (HAN). Its generative model receives a\nrandom vector as input and its training is based on generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN). To assess the performance of BL, we perform experiments using\nseveral architectures with fully and convolutional layers, with and without\nbias. Experimental results show that both methods improve robustness to white\nnoise static and adversarial examples, and even increase accuracy, but have\ndifferent behavior depending on the architecture and task, being more\nbeneficial to use the one or the other. Nevertheless, HAN using a convolutional\narchitecture with batch normalization presents outstanding robustness, reaching\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on adversarial examples of hand-written digits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 12:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 16:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

A key benefit of the EnKF method is that it requires only the\nevaluation of the forward propagation but not its derivatives.

For this reason it has been necessary to re-think\nthe architecture with a modular system built around the messaging concept,\nwhere each modular component speaks to the other interested parties through a\nsystem of broker-managed queues. The first implemented protocol, the Simple\nCone Search, shows the messaging task architecture connecting the parametric\nHTTP interface to the database backend access module, the logging module, and\nallows multiple cone search resources to be managed together through a\nconfiguration manager module. Even if relatively young, it already proved the\nflexibility required by the overall system when the database backend changed\nfrom MySQL to PostgreSQL+PgSphere.

We follow\nthe PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving properties about Haskell\nprograms in the proof assistant Coq. On the one hand, as a PhD student in\ncomputer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software\nproducts. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software,\nverifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs\nin the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other\nhand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving\nare becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive\ntheorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. To prove properties\nabout a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq\ncode. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona\nhas to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona\nfinds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell\nfunctions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell\nprograms into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with\na concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a\npartial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work\nin Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the\ntransformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination\nchecker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey\nthrough the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like\nfree monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof\nassistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their\ninterplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally\nproposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona\nstarts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell\nfunctions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the\noriginal idea in Agda. Mona's final solution not only works for a specific\nmonad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead\nof proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is\nable to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a\ncontainer-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her\nconfidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach\nin a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share\nthe results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a\nliterate Coq file. If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming\nor are at least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved\nreasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a curious soul\nlooking for the next story about monads and proofs, then this tale is for you.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 13:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 10:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 14:25:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 18:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

The result may be useful to develop a novel spinful matter wave valve\nthat integrates spin switcher, beam-splitter, isolator, and converter. The\nmethod can also be applied to other real systems, e.g., realizing perfect\nisolation of spin states in magnetism, which is otherwise rather difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 15:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Here we answer this problem by\nanalyzing a QED model, considering both spontaneous and stimulated emission of\nquantized radiation field. For coherent radiation (Glauber state), we confirm\nthat stimulated emission/absorption of photons has a dependence on wavepacket\nsize that decays when it exceeds the interacting radiation wavelength,\nconsistently and complementarily with Schrodinger equation analysis of\nwavepacket acceleration in classical electromagnetic field. Furthermore, the\nstimulated emission of modulated electron wavepacket with coherently-bunched\nprofiles has characteristic harmonic emission spectrum that is also wavepacket\nsize dependent but beyond the frequency cut-off. In either case, there is no\nwavepacket dependent emission of Fock state radiation, and particularly the\nvacuum state spontaneous emission is wavepacket-independent. The transition of\nradiation emission from the classical point-particle limit to the quantum\nelectron wavefunction limit is demonstrated in electron wavepacket\nrepresentation. It indicates a way for measuring the wavepacket size of single\nelectron wavefunction, and suggests a new direction for exploring light-matter\ninteraction fundamentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 14:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Then, we design a low complexity\nLyapunov-based online algorithm, which can be implemented in an online and\ndistributed manner without the complete future and global network information.\nNumerical results show that the proposed online algorithm achieves an average\n97% of the theoretical maximum social welfare. We further conduct experiments\nwith real data traces, to compare our proposed online algorithm with the\nexisting online algorithms in the literature. Experiment results show that our\nalgorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of both the achievable\nbitrate (with an average gain of 20% - 30%) and social welfare (with an average\ngain of 10% - 50%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 08:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

The main STM initiator was George Boole, who worked with a universe of\ndiscourse, U, which contains the pairwise complementary sets, or categorical\nterms, S, non-S, P, non-P, M, non-M, and is thus partitioned into eight\nsubsets: SPM, SP(non-M),...,(non-S)(non-P)(non-M), where the intersection was\ndenoted by adjacency. In STM all superfluous syllogistic figures are\ndisregarded, and both the positive terms, S, P, M, and the negative terms,\nnon-S, non-P, non-M, are allowed to appear in the pairs of categorical premises\n(PCPs) and their entailed logical consequences (LCs). This increases the number\nof distinct P (resp. S) premises from the six formulable via only positive\nterms, to eight, and the number of distinct PCPs from the 36 appearing in the\nClassical Categorical Syllogistic (CCS), to the 64 appearing in the STM. Out of\nthe latter 64 PCPs, only 32 PCPs entail LCs and thus generate VCAs. These VCAs,\n(and the VS), split into four types. Each type contains eight VCAs. Any VCA can\nbe re-written as any other VCA of the same type, via a group G of eight\nre-labelings. Thus the VCAs Barbara, Darapti, Darii, Disamis, can be chosen as\ntype representatives for both VCAs and VS, and via a term relabeling, any VCA\nor VS can be re-written, without changing their PCP or LC contents, as either a\nBarbara, Darapti, Darii, or Disamis. One discusses the VCAs and their LCs,\nsimple/biliteral VCA sorites, empty set constraints (ESC), VCA distribution\nconservation, and other Rules of Valid Categorical Arguments (RofVCA) which are\nVCA generalized versions of some of the Rules of Valid Syllogisms (RofVS). Note\nthat CCS restricts the VS to only LCs of the formats A(S,P), E(S,P), I(S,P),\nO(S,P).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 00:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 02:40:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 06:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}
