Previously, we began investigating toy models for the 5-D analog of the\nkinetic mixing/vector portal scenario where the interactions of bulk dark\nmatter with the brane-localized fields of the Standard Model are mediated by a\nmassive $U(1)_D$ dark photon also living in the bulk. In that setup, where the\ndark matter was taken to be a complex scalar, a number of nice features were\nobtained such as $U(1)_D$ breaking by boundary conditions without the\nintroduction of a dark Higgs field, the absence of potentially troublesome SM\nHiggs-dark singlet mixing, also by boundary conditions, the natural similarity\nof the dark matter and dark photon masses and the decoupling of the heavy gauge\nKaluza-Klein states from the Standard Model. In the present paper we extend\nthis approach by examining the more complex cases of Dirac and Majorana\nfermionic dark matter. In particular, we discuss a new mechanism that can occur\nin 5-D (but not in 4-D) that allows for light Dirac dark matter in the $\\sim\n100$ MeV mass range, even though it has an $s$-wave annihilation into Standard\nModel fields, by avoiding the strong constraints that arise from both the CMB\nand 21 cm data. This mechanism makes use of the presence of the Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations of the dark photon to extremize the increase in the annihilation\ncross section usually obtained via resonant enhancement. In the Majorana dark\nmatter case, we explore the possibility of a direct $s$-channel dark matter\npair-annihilation process producing the observed relic density, due to the\ngeneral presence of parity-violating dark matter interactions, without\nemploying the usual co-annihilation mechanism which is naturally suppressed in\nthis 5-D setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 16:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 20:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 13:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The current action detection\napproaches follow a complex pipeline which involves multiple tasks such as tube\nproposals, optical flow, and tube classification. In this work, we present a\nmore elegant solution for action detection based on the recently developed\ncapsule network. We propose a 3D capsule network for videos, called\nVideoCapsuleNet: a unified network for action detection which can jointly\nperform pixel-wise action segmentation along with action classification. The\nproposed network is a generalization of capsule network from 2D to 3D, which\ntakes a sequence of video frames as input. The 3D generalization drastically\nincreases the number of capsules in the network, making capsule routing\ncomputationally expensive. We introduce capsule-pooling in the convolutional\ncapsule layer to address this issue which makes the voting algorithm tractable.\nThe routing-by-agreement in the network inherently models the action\nrepresentations and various action characteristics are captured by the\npredicted capsules. This inspired us to utilize the capsules for action\nlocalization and the class-specific capsules predicted by the network are used\nto determine a pixel-wise localization of actions. The localization is further\nimproved by parameterized skip connections with the convolutional capsule\nlayers and the network is trained end-to-end with a classification as well as\nlocalization loss. The proposed network achieves sate-of-the-art performance on\nmultiple action detection datasets including UCF-Sports, J-HMDB, and UCF-101\n(24 classes) with an impressive ~20% improvement on UCF-101 and ~15%\nimprovement on J-HMDB in terms of v-mAP scores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 16:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

In\ncontrast to the traditional DSMC method based on the classical scattering, the\nproposed implementation allows us to model flows of gases over the whole\ntemperature range beginning from 1 K up any high temperature when no ionization\nhappens. To illustrate the new numerical approach, two helium isotopes $^3$He\nand $^4$He were considered in two canonical problems, namely, heat transfer\nbetween two planar surfaces and planar Couette flow. To solve these problems,\nthe ab initio potential for helium is used, but the proposed technique can be\nused with any intermolecular potential. The problems were solved over the\ntemperature range from 1 K to 3000 K and for two values of the rarefaction\nparameter 1 and 10. The former corresponds to the transitional regime and the\nlast describes the temperature jump and velocity slip regime. No influence of\nthe quantum effects was detected within the numerical error of 0.1 % for the\ntemperature 300 K and higher. However, the quantum approach requires less\ncomputational effort than the classical one in this temperature range.

Controls are applied\nvia same-fluid blowing and suction through the substrate surface. We consider\nboth overlying and hanging films, where the liquid lies above or below the\nsubstrate, respectively. We study the weakly nonlinear evolution of the system,\nwhich is governed by a forced Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation in two space\ndimensions. The uncontrolled problem exhibits three ranges of dynamics\ndepending on the incline of the substrate: stable flat film solution, bounded\nchaotic dynamics, or unbounded exponential growth of unstable transverse modes.\nWe proceed with the assumption that we may actuate at every point on the\nsubstrate. The main focus is the optimal control problem, which we first study\nin the special case that the forcing may only vary in the spanwise direction.\nThe structure of the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation allows the explicit\nconstruction of optimal controls in this case using the classical theory of\nlinear quadratic regulators. Such controls are employed to prevent the\nexponential growth of transverse waves in the case of a hanging film, revealing\ncomplex dynamics for the streamwise and mixed modes. We then consider the\noptimal control problem in full generality, and prove the existence of an\noptimal control. For numerical simulations, we employ an iterative gradient\ndescent algorithm. In the final section, we consider the effects of transverse\nmode forcing on the chaotic dynamics present in the streamwise and mixed modes\nfor the case of a vertical film flow. Coupling through nonlinearity allows us\nto reduce the average energy in solutions without directly forcing the linearly\nunstable dominant modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 18:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

With such an\nextinction threshold, molecular clouds in metal-poor regions should have high\nsurface densities and high internal pressures. If high pressure is associated\nwith the formation of massive clusters, then metal-poor galaxies such as dwarfs\nin the early universe could have been the hosts of metal-poor globular\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 18:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

We use the Gaia DR2 catalog to measure the relative\nproper motion of VFTS 16 and nearby bright stars to test if this star might\nhave been ejected from the central cluster, R136, via dynamical ejection. We\nfind that the position angle and magnitude of the relative proper motion (0.338\n+/- 0.046 mas/yr, or approximately 80 +\\- 11 km/s) of VFTS 16 are consistent\nwith ejection from R136 approximately 1.5 +/- 0.2 Myr ago, very soon after the\ncluster was formed. There is some tension with the presumed age of VFTS 16\nthat, from published stellar parameters, cannot be greater than 0.9 +0.3/-0.2\nMyr. Older ages for this star would appear to be prohibited due to the absence\nof He I lines in its optical spectrum, since this sets a firm lower limit on\nits effective temperature. The dynamical constraints may imply an unusual\nevolutionary history for this object, perhaps indicating it is a merger\nproduct. Gaia DR2 also confirms that another very massive star in the Tarantula\nNebula, VFTS 72 (alias BI253; O2 III-V(n)((f*)), is also a runaway on the basis\nof its proper motion as measured by Gaia. While its tangential proper motion\n(0.392 +/-0.062 mas/yr or 93 +/-15 km/s) would be consistent with dynamical\nejection from R136 approximately 1 Myr ago, its position angle is discrepant\nwith this direction at the 2$\\sigma$ level. From their Gaia DR2 proper motions\nwe conclude that the two ~100 solar mass O2 stars, VFTS 16 and VFTS72, are fast\nrunaway stars, with space velocities of around 100 km/s relative to R136 and\nthe local massive star population.

Analysis of the\nstriae of the intensity variation in the dynamic spectrum allowed us to reveal\ntwo quasi-oscillatory components.

However, modularity maximization, a popular method for\nperforming multilayer community detection, requires the specification of an\nappropriate null model as well as resolution and interlayer coupling\nparameters. Importantly, the ability of the algorithm to accurately detect\ncommunity evolution is dependent on the choice of these parameters. In\nfunctional temporal networks, where evolving communities reflect changing\nfunctional relationships between network nodes, it is especially important that\nthe detected communities reflect any state changes of the system. Here, we\npresent analytical work suggesting that a uniform null model provides improved\nsensitivity to the detection of small evolving communities in temporal\ncorrelation networks.

The adoption of high-level synthesis (HLS) from\nlanguages such as C++ and OpenCL has greatly increased programmer productivity\nwhen designing for such platforms. While this has enabled a wider audience to\ntarget spatial computing architectures, the optimization principles known from\ntraditional software design are no longer sufficient to implement\nhigh-performance codes, due to fundamentally distinct aspects of hardware\ndesign, such as programming for deep pipelines, distributed memory resources,\nand scalable routing. To alleviate this, we present a collection of optimizing\ntransformations for HLS, targeting scalable and efficient architectures for\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) applications. We systematically identify\nclasses of transformations (pipelining, scalability, and memory), the\ncharacteristics of their effect on the HLS code and the resulting hardware\n(e.g., increasing data reuse or resource consumption), and the objectives that\neach transformation can target (e.g., resolve interface contention, or increase\nparallelism).

A prop is a strict symmetric monoidal category where\nthe objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given by\naddition. In this approach, electrical circuits make up the morphisms in a\nprop, as do signal-flow diagrams, and bond graphs. A network, such as an\nelectrical circuit, with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to\n$n$, while putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them\nside by side is tensoring. Here we work out the details of this approach for\nvarious kinds of electrical circuits, then signal-flow diagrams, and then bond\ngraphs. Each kind of network corresponds to a mathematically natural prop. We\nalso describe the \"behavior\" of electrical circuits, bond graphs, and\nsignal-flow diagrams using morphisms between props. To assign a behavior to a\nnetwork we \"black box\" the network, which forgets its inner workings and\nrecords only the relation it imposes between inputs and outputs. The process of\nblack-boxing a network then corresponds to a morphism between props.\nInterestingly, there are two different behaviors for any bond graph, related by\na natural transformation. To achieve all of this we first prove some\nfoundational results about props. These results let us describe any prop in\nterms of generators and equations, and also define morphisms of props by naming\nwhere the generators go and checking that relevant equations hold. Technically,\nthe key tools are the Rosebrugh--Sabadini--Walters result relating circuits to\nspecial commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and\nsignatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are\nequivalent to props.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 21:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

We propose a model in which a small\nnumber of observations are assumed to arise from some of the labeled component\ndensities. The resulting model is not exchangeable, allowing inference on the\ncomponent features without post-processing. Our method assigns meaning to the\ncomponent labels at the modeling stage and can be justified as a data-dependent\ninformative prior on the labelings. We show that our method produces\ninterpretable results, often (but not always) similar to those resulting from\nrelabeling algorithms, with the added benefit that the marginal inferences\noriginate directly from a well specified probability model rather than a post\nhoc manipulation. We provide asymptotic results leading to practical guidelines\nfor model selection that are motivated by maximizing prior information about\nthe class labels and demonstrate our method on real and simulated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 22:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 20:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 19:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

Regarding a single UAV's path\nplanning design, we manage to substantially simplify the traditional dynamic\nprogram and propose an optimal algorithm of low computation complexity, which\nis only polynomial with respect to both the numbers of spatial locations and\nuser demands. After coordinating a large number $K$ of UAVs, this simplified\ndynamic optimization problem becomes intractable and we alternatively present a\nfast iterative cooperation algorithm with provable approximation ratio\n$1-(1-\\frac{1}{K})^{K}$ in the worst case, which is proved to obviously\noutperform the traditional approach of partitioning UAVs to serve different\nlocation clusters separately.

At the back-end side, the businesses are powered by big data\nprocessing platforms to quickly extract information and make decisions. Running\non top of a computing cluster, those platforms utilize scheduling algorithms to\nallocate resources. An efficient scheduler is crucial to the system performance\ndue to limited resources, e.g. CPU and Memory, and a large number of user\ndemands. However, besides requests from clients and current status of the\nsystem, it has limited knowledge about execution length of the running jobs,\nand incoming jobs' resource demands, which make assigning resources a\nchallenging task. If most of the resources are occupied by a long-running job,\nother jobs will have to keep waiting until it releases them. This paper\npresents a new scheduling strategy, named DRESS that particularly aims to\noptimize the allocation among jobs with various demands. Specifically, it\nclassifies the jobs into two categories based on their requests, reserves a\nportion of resources for each of category, and dynamically adjusts the reserved\nratio by monitoring the pending requests and estimating release patterns of\nrunning jobs. The results demonstrate DRESS significantly reduces the\ncompletion time for one category, up to 76.1% in our experiments, and in the\nmeanwhile, maintains a stable overall system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 02:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2021 23:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Our experimental setup makes use of an LC oscillator\ninductively coupled to an RLC oscillator, where the time-periodic (Floquet)\ninductive coupling and resistive-heating losses can be independently controlled\nby means of external voltage signals. With a Floquet dissipation, we observe\nthat slowly-decaying eigenmodes emerge at vanishingly small dissipation\nstrength in the weak coupling limit. With a moderate, Floquet coupling,\nmultiple instances of their emergence and disappearance are observed. With an\nasymmetric dimer model, we show that these transitions, driven by\navoided-level-crossing in purely dissipative systems, are generically present\nin both static and Floquet domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 05:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

Cryptographic key is an important entity in this\nprocedure. In general, randomly generated cryptographic key (of 256 bits) is\ndifficult to remember. However, such a key needs to be stored in a protected\nplace or transported through a shared communication line which, in fact, poses\nanother threat to security. As an alternative, researchers advocate the\ngeneration of cryptographic key using the biometric traits of both sender and\nreceiver during the sessions of communication, thus avoiding key storing and at\nthe same time without compromising the strength in security. Nevertheless, the\nbiometric-based cryptographic key generation possesses few concerns such as\nprivacy of biometrics, sharing of biometric data between both communicating\nusers (i.e., sender and receiver), and generating revocable key from\nirrevocable biometric. This work addresses the above-mentioned concerns.\n  In this work, a framework for secure communication between two users using\nfingerprint based crypto-biometric system has been proposed. For this,\nDiffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm is used to generate public keys from private keys\nof both sender and receiver which are shared and further used to produce a\nsymmetric cryptographic key at both ends. In this approach, revocable key for\nsymmetric cryptography is generated from irrevocable fingerprint. The biometric\ndata is neither stored nor shared which ensures the security of biometric data,\nand perfect forward secrecy is achieved using session keys.

Three active lines of research have\nindependently explored transfer learning using neural networks. In weight\ntransfer, a model trained on the source domain is used as an initialization\npoint for a network to be trained on the target domain. In deep metric\nlearning, the source domain is used to construct an embedding that captures\nclass structure in both the source and target domains.

Using this criterion and the relationship between\nthe source localization problem and the problem of computing the greatest\ncommon divisor (GCD), or more practically approximate GCD, for polynomials, we\npropose two algorithms which adaptively learn the number of sources and\nestimate their locations.

Their particularity is that they aim\nat offering strong consistency (no forks) in an open system combining two\ningredients (i) a set of validators that generate blocks via a variant of\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol and (ii) a\nselection strategy that dynamically selects nodes to be validators for the next\nblock via a proof-of-stake mechanism. However,the exact assumptions on the\nsystem model under which Tendermint underlying algorithms are correct and the\nexact properties Tendermint verifies have never been formally analyzed. The\ncontribution of this paper is two-fold. First, while formalizing Tendermint\nalgorithms we precisely characterize the system model and the exact problem\nsolved by Tendermint. We prove that in eventual synchronous systems a modified\nversion of Tendermint solves (i) under additional assumptions, a variant of\none-shot consensus for the validation of one single block and (ii) a variant of\nthe repeated consensus problem for multiple blocks. These results hold even if\nthe set of validators is hit by Byzantine failures, provided that for each\none-shot consensus instance less than one third of the validators is Byzantine.\nOur second contribution relates to the fairness of the rewarding mechanism. It\nis common knowledge that in permisionless blockchain systems the main threat is\nthe tragedy of commons that may yield the system to collapse if the rewarding\nmechanism is not adequate. Ad minimum the rewarding mechanism must be fair,\ni.e.distributing the rewards in proportion to the merit of participants. We\nprove, for the first time in blockchain systems, that in repeated-consensus\nbased blockchains there exists an (eventual) fair rewarding mechanism if and\nonly if the system is (eventual) synchronous. We also show that the original\nTendermint rewarding is not fair, however, a modification of the original\nprotocol makes it eventually fair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 07:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 10:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 11:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

Distributed deep learning is becoming a necessity to\ncope with growing data and model sizes. Its computation is typically\ncharacterized by a simple tensor data abstraction to model multi-dimensional\nmatrices, a data-flow graph to model computation, and iterative executions with\nrelatively frequent synchronizations, thereby making it substantially different\nfrom Map/Reduce style distributed big data computation.\n  RPC, commonly used as the communication primitive, has been adopted by\npopular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, which uses gRPC. We show\nthat RPC is sub-optimal for distributed deep learning computation, especially\non an RDMA-capable network. The tensor abstraction and data-flow graph, coupled\nwith an RDMA network, offers the opportunity to reduce the unnecessary overhead\n(e.g., memory copy) without sacrificing programmability and generality. In\nparticular, from a data access point of view, a remote machine is abstracted\njust as a \"device\" on an RDMA channel, with a simple memory interface for\nallocating, reading, and writing memory regions. Our graph analyzer looks at\nboth the data flow graph and the tensors to optimize memory allocation and\nremote data access using this interface. The result is up to 25 times speedup\nin representative deep learning benchmarks against the standard gRPC in\nTensorFlow and up to 169% improvement even against an RPC implementation\noptimized for RDMA, leading to faster convergence in the training process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 07:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

In\nthis paper we generalize the NRCM in two different ways to the relativistic\nregime and present analytical solutions of the corresponding Einstein\nequations. These relativistic models are characterized by two inequivalent\nextensions of the FLWR metric with a time-dependent curvature function $K (t)$\nand an expansion scalar $a(t)$. The fluid flow is supposed to be geodesic. The\nmodel V1 is shear-free with isotropic pressure and therefore conformal flat. In\ncontrast to V1 the second model V2 shows a nontrivial shear and an anisotropic\npressure. For both models the inhomogeneous solutions of the corresponding\nEinstein equations will agree in leading order at small distances with the NRCM\nif a(t) and K(t) are each identical with those determined in the NCRM.

In this work we\nstudy the generation of photon pairs in cavity-assisted SPDC and SFWM for the\ngeneral case of off-resonant conversion, namely, when the frequencies of the\ngenerated photons do not match the cavity resonances. Such a frequency mismatch\nin particular depends on temperature and requires an additional control in the\nexperiment.

Based on the raw bounding boxes of the detector we fine-tuned\noverlapping bounding boxes by three approaches: non-maximum suppression, soft\nnon-maximum suppression and soft non-maximum suppression with Gaussian\nsmoothing. The evaluation was done on the PIROPO database and an own annotated\nFlat dataset, supplemented with bounding boxes on omnidirectional images. We\nachieve an average precision of 64.4 % with YOLOv2 for the class person on\nPIROPO and 77.6 % on Flat. For this purpose we fine-tuned the soft non-maximum\nsuppression with Gaussian smoothing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 11:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 12:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 14:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 09:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

An algorithm to perform distributed over-predictive signal\nanalytics in the IoT cloud, based on signal approximations by IoT devices, is\nproposed. The fundamental tradeoff between the signal approximation bandwidth\nused by IoT devices and the approximation error in signal analytics at the IoT\ncloud is quantified for the class of differentiable signals. Simulation results\nare also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 11:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

While\nmany proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to\nrationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why\nDNNs do not strongly overfit. In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By\napplying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from\nalgorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map\nof many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions. We then\nprovide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for\nBoolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional\nnetworks applied to CIFAR10 and MNIST. As the target functions in many real\nproblems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias\nhelps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems. This\npicture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken\nover the DNN input-output function space, rather than the more conventional\nprior over parameter space. If we assume that the training algorithm samples\nparameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes\ntheorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target\nfunctions producing high-likelihood training sets. By exploiting recently\ndiscovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to estimate the\nmarginal likelihood, we produce relatively tight generalization PAC-Bayes error\nbounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as\nMNIST and CIFAR10 and for architectures including convolutional and fully\nconnected networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 11:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 10:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 18:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 23:40:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2019 10:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

To remedy this problem, it has been\nsuggested to combine blockchains with trusted execution environments (TEEs),\nsuch as Intel SGX, for executing applications that demand privacy. Untrusted\nblockchain nodes cannot get access to the data and computations inside the TEE.\n  This paper first explores some pitfalls that arise from the combination of\nTEEs with blockchains. Since TEEs are, in principle, stateless they are\nsusceptible to rollback attacks, which should be prevented to maintain privacy\nfor the application. However, in blockchains with non-final consensus\nprotocols, such as the proof-of-work in Ethereum and others, the contract\nexecution must handle rollbacks by design. This implies that TEEs for securing\nblockchain execution cannot be directly used for such blockchains; this\napproach works only when the consensus decisions are final.\n  Second, this work introduces an architecture and a prototype for\nsmart-contract execution within Intel SGX technology for Hyperledger Fabric, a\nprominent platform for enterprise blockchain applications. Our system resolves\ndifficulties posed by the execute-order-validate architecture of Fabric and\nprevents rollback attacks on TEE-based execution as far as possible. For\nincreasing security, our design encapsulates each application on the blockchain\nwithin its own enclave that shields it from the host system. An evaluation\nshows that the overhead moving execution into SGX is within 10%-20% for a\nsealed-bid auction application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 12:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

This limits their\npotential for widespread application, since creation of manual annotations is\nan expensive process considering the numerous types of existing surgeries and\nthe vast amount of laparoscopic videos available. In this work, we propose a\nnew self-supervised pre-training approach based on the prediction of remaining\nsurgery duration (RSD) from laparoscopic videos. The RSD prediction task is\nused to pre-train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) network in an end-to-end manner. Our proposed approach utilizes\nall available data and reduces the reliance on annotated data, thereby\nfacilitating the scaling up of surgical phase recognition algorithms to\ndifferent kinds of surgeries.

The\neffectiveness of the method depends critically on the availability of well\nperforming summary statistics. Summary statistic selection relies heavily on\ndomain knowledge and carefully engineered features, and can be a laborious time\nconsuming process. Since the method is sensitive to data dimensionality, the\nprocess of selecting summary statistics must balance the need to include\ninformative statistics and the dimensionality of the feature vector. This paper\nproposes to treat the problem of dynamically selecting an appropriate summary\nstatistic from a given pool of candidate summary statistics as a multi-armed\nbandit problem. This allows approximate Bayesian computation rejection sampling\nto dynamically focus on a distribution over well performing summary statistics\nas opposed to a fixed set of statistics. The proposed method is unique in that\nit does not require any pre-processing and is scalable to a large number of\ncandidate statistics. This enables efficient use of a large library of possible\ntime series summary statistics without prior feature engineering.

Here we show that the spectrum of\nshapes among Saturn's small moons is a natural outcome of merging collisions\namong similar-sized moonlets possessing physical properties and orbits that are\nconsistent with those of the current moons. A significant fraction of such\nmerging collisions take place either at the first encounter or after 1-2\nhit-and-run events, with impact velocities in the range of 1-5 times the mutual\nescape velocity. Close to head-on mergers result in flattened objects with\nlarge equatorial ridges, as observed on Atlas and Pan. With slightly more\noblique impact angles, collisions lead to elongated, Prometheus-like shapes.\nThese results suggest that the current forms of the small moons provide direct\nevidence of the processes at the final stages of their formation, involving\npairwise encounters of moonlets of comparable size. Finally, we show that this\nmechanism may also explain the formation of Iapetus' equatorial ridge, as well\nas its oblate shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 15:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

For concreteness, we focus on the detection of cancer cells\nlocated in a particular region of a blood vessel. These cancer cells produce\nand emit special molecules, so-called biomarkers, which are symptomatic for the\npresence of anomaly, into the cardiovascular system. Detection of cancer\nbiomarkers with conventional blood tests is difficult in the early stages of a\ncancer due to the very low concentration of the biomarkers in the samples\ntaken. However, close to the cancer cells, the concentration of the cancer\nbiomarkers is high. Hence, detection is possible if a sensor with the ability\nto detect these biomarkers is placed in the vicinity of the cancer cells.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study the use of MNSs that are injected at a\nsuitable injection site and can move through the blood vessels of the\ncardiovascular system, which potentially contain cancer cells. These MNSs can\nbe activated by the biomarkers close to the cancer cells, where the biomarker\nconcentration is sufficiently high. Eventually, the MNSs are collected by a\nfusion center (FC) where their activation levels are read and exploited to\ndeclare the presence of anomaly. We analytically derive the biomarker\nconcentration as well as the probability mass function of the MNSs' activation\nlevels and validate the obtained results via particle-based simulations. Then,\nwe derive the optimal decision rule for the FC regarding the presence of\nanomaly assuming that the entire network is known at the FC. Finally, for the\nFC, we propose a simple sum detector that does not require knowledge of the\nnetwork topology. Our simulations reveal that while the optimal detector\nachieves a higher performance than the sum detector, both proposed detectors\nsignificantly outperform a benchmark scheme that used fixed nanosensors at the\nFC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 08:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

Battery\nlife was reduced from 21.3 hours to 18.8 hours when scanning every 5 minutes\nwith a reduction of 2.5 hours or 12%. Despite this relatively small reduction,\nmost participants reported that the app had a noticeable effect on their\nbattery life. In addition to battery life, the purpose of data collection,\ntrust in the organization that collects data, and perceived impact on privacy\nwere identified as main factors for acceptability. Conclusions: Based on the\nfindings of the feasibility study and literature review, we recommend a\ncommitment to open science and transparent reporting and stronger partnerships\nand communication with users. Sensing technology has the potential to greatly\nenhance the delivery and impact of mental health care. Realizing this requires\nall aspects of mobile phone sensor technology to be rigorously assessed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 05:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 00:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

This is usually far easier than\nbounding the expected first-hitting time directly.\n  Due to the widespread use of drift theory, it is of utmost importance to have\nthe best drift theorems possible.

The electron device\ncommunity found many of the answers in two dimensional materials, especially\ngraphene. With an astounding mobility and perfectly symmetrical bandstructure,\ngraphene may be, just the replacement for silicon we have been looking for. In\nthis report, the mechanism of tunneling in a graphene-insulator-graphene (GIG)\njunction has been studied, by applying Bardeen's transfer Hamiltonian approach.\nLater, the formalism of the GIG junction has been used to study the performance\nand current-voltage characteristics of a symmetric tunneling field effect\ntransistor or SymFET. The device exhibits a small tunneling current at most of\nthe biasing voltages. But when the Dirac points of the oppositely doped\ngraphene layers are aligned, a large amount of tunneling current is observed.\nThe performance of the device has been studied for various device dimensions.\nThe resonant current peak is also shown to increase for higher levels of\ndoping. The extraordinary symmetry of the I-V characteristics makes SymFET a\npotential candidate for high speed analog devices. The SymFET is also shown to\nbe robust to temperature changes, since tunneling is the main mechanism of\ncharge transport. With further study and modifications, the SymFET can become a\npopular choice for both analog and digital circuit implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 04:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

This is a problem for large networks. Strategies have been\ndeveloped to trade memory for added computations, which results in a sublinear\ngrowth of memory footprint or computation overhead. In this work, we present a\nlibrary that uses asynchronous storing and prefetching to move data to and from\nslow and cheap stor- age. The library only stores and prefetches states as\nfrequently as possible without delaying the computation, and uses the optimal\nRevolve backpropagation strategy for the computations in between. The memory\nfootprint of the backpropagation can thus be reduced to any size (e.g. to fit\ninto DRAM), while the computational overhead is constant in the sequence\nlength, and only depends on the ratio between compute and transfer times on a\ngiven hardware. We show in experiments that by exploiting asyncronous data\ntransfer, our strategy is always at least as fast, and usually faster than the\npreviously studied \"optimal\" strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 12:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

Analytical solutions of a linear DDE in presence\nof external forcing due to the (pulsed) injection of gas and outgassing from a\nstainless steel (SS) wall are then derived using the Laplace transform method,\nwhere the transcendental characteristic equation is approximated by means of\nrational transfer functions such as diagonal Pad{\\'e} approximation.

A singular\nperturbation method is used to solve the resultant initial value problem (IVP)\ntype second-order ODE.

We investigate the\nefficiency of such systems under different outdoor conditions using exergy\nanalysis and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. This analysis makes it possible to\nassess performance in terms of loss of work potential, to account for the\ndifferent quality of energy and to localize and compare the different sources\nof loss in the system. It also enables the use of exergy efficiency as a single\nperformance parameter, in contrast to the several indicators that are commonly\nused. These more common indicators are difficult to compare and relate to each\nother. Further, since there is no obvious optimal trade-off between them, it is\nchallenging to combine them and develop a global performance indicator that\nallows for a sensible comparison of different technical solutions and different\ntypes of recovery devices. We illustrate the concepts by applying the analysis\nto a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) and to a structurally similar membrane\nenergy recovery ventilator (MERV) that can exchange both heat and moisture. We\nshow how the exergy efficiency can be used to identify the range of operating\nconditions for which the recovery ventilator is not beneficial as the energy\ncost is greater than the energy recovery. This is not trivial using traditional\nperformance parameters, yet it is a natural outcome of exergy analysis.

The principle is to illuminate a levitating particle\ndisplaced at high velocity in three dimensions (3D) to create images based on\npersistence of vision (POV). Light scattered by the particle can be observed\nall around the volumetric display and therefore provides a true 3D image that\ndoes not rely on interference effects and remains insensitive to the angle of\nobservation. The challenge is to control with a high accuracy and at high speed\nthe trajectory of the particle in three dimensions. Systems that use light to\ngenerate free-space images either in plasma or with a bead are strictly\ndependent of the scanning method used. Mechanical systems are required to scan\nthe particles in the volume which weakens the time dynamics.

A single gold particle colloid is manipulated\nin three dimensions through AC and DC electrical voltages applied to a PPT.\nElectric voltages can be modulated at high frequencies (150 kHz) and allow for\na high speed displacement of particles without moving any other system\ncomponent. The optical scattering of the particle in levitation yields\nfree-space images that are imaged with conventional optics.
