It could,\nhowever, provide information on a planet's atmosphere and surface, and on the\npresence of life, because homochiral molecules that are the building blocks of\nlife on Earth are known to reflect circularly polarized light.\n  We compute $P_c$, the degree of circular polarization, for light that is\nreflected by rocky (exo)planets with liquid water or sulfuric acid solution\nclouds, both spatially resolved across the planetary disk and, for planets with\npatchy clouds, integrated across the planetary disk, for various planetary\nphase angles $\\alpha$.\n  The optical thickness and vertical distribution of the atmospheric gas and\nclouds, the size parameter and refractive index of the cloud particles, and\n$\\alpha$ all influence $P_c$. Spatially resolved, $P_c$ varies between $\\pm\n0.20\\%$ (the sign indicates the polarization direction). Only for small gas\noptical thicknesses above the clouds do significant sign changes (related to\ncloud particle properties) across the planets' hemispheres occur. For patchy\nclouds, the disk--integrated $P_c$ is typically smaller than $\\pm 0.025\\%$,\nwith maximums for $\\alpha$ between $40^\\circ$ and $70^\\circ$, and $120^\\circ$\nto $140^\\circ$. As expected, the disk--integrated $P_c$ is virtually zero at\n$\\alpha=0^\\circ$ and 180$^\\circ$. The disk--integrated $P_c$ is also very small\nat $\\alpha \\approx 100^\\circ$.\n  Measuring circular polarization signals appears to be challenging with\ncurrent technology. The small atmospheric circular polarization signal could,\nhowever, allow the detection of circular polarization due to homochiral\nmolecules. Confirmation of the detectability of such signals requires better\nknowledge of the strength of circular polarization signals of biological\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 16:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

A cognitive radio system will be\nable to sense the availability of radio frequencies, analyze the condition of\nthe sensed channels, and decide the best option for optimal communication. To\nselect the best option out of the overwhelming amount of information, a channel\nranking mechanism can be employed. While several channel ranking techniques\nhave been proposed, most of them only consider the occupancy rate of the sensed\nchannels. However, there are other significantly important parameters that\nprovide information on the condition of channels and should also be considered\nduring the ranking process. This paper proposes a utility-based channel ranking\nmechanism that takes into account signal-to-noise ratio and the occupancy rate\nof the channels to determine their usefulness or preference. The paper at first\ndiscusses the need for channel ranking and the involved process. Then the\nsuitability of different mathematical functions is investigated for utility\nmodeling of the channel based on its SNR and occupancy. Finally, results are\nprovided that show improved channel ranking compared to that of spectrum\noccupancy based ranking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 16:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-23"}

For example, we prove that modules over the semiring\ncategory Fin of finite sets are cocartesian monoidal $\\infty$-categories, and\nmodules over Burn (the Burnside $\\infty$-category) are additive\n$\\infty$-categories.\n  As a consequence, we can regard Lawvere theories as cyclic\n$\\text{Fin}^\\text{op}$-modules, leading to algebraic foundations for the higher\ncategorical study of Lawvere theories. We prove that Lawvere theories function\nas a home for an algebraic Yoneda lemma.\n  Finally, we provide evidence for a formal duality between naive and genuine\nequivariant homotopy theory, in the form of a group-theoretic Eilenberg-Watts\nTheorem.

We discuss aspects of these phenomena beyond the random matrix setting,\nincluding the Mellin transform of products and Wronskians of pairs of classical\northogonal polynomials. When the random matrix model has orthogonal or\nsymplectic symmetry, we obtain a new duality formula relating their moments to\nhypergeometric orthogonal polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 17:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 16:28:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 11:12:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 16:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 14:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

A major issue\nin distributed training is the limited communication bandwidth between\ncontributing nodes or prohibitive communication cost in general. These\nchallenges become even more pressing, as the number of computation nodes\nincreases. To counteract this development we propose sparse binary compression\n(SBC), a compression framework that allows for a drastic reduction of\ncommunication cost for distributed training. SBC combines existing techniques\nof communication delay and gradient sparsification with a novel binarization\nmethod and optimal weight update encoding to push compression gains to new\nlimits. By doing so, our method also allows us to smoothly trade-off gradient\nsparsity and temporal sparsity to adapt to the requirements of the learning\ntask.

Microlensing has the potential to probe\nthis hidden population, as it can measure both the mass and five of the six\nphase-space coordinates (all except the radial velocity) even of a dark\nisolated lens. However, the measurements of both the microlens parallax and\nfinite-source effects are needed in order to recover the full information.\nHere, we combine $Spitzer$ satellite parallax measurement with the ground-based\nlight curve, which exhibits strong finite-source effects, of event\nOGLE-2017-BLG-0896. We find two degenerate solutions for the lens (due to the\nknown satellite-parallax degeneracy), which are consistent with each other\nexcept for their proper motion. The lens is an isolated brown dwarf with a mass\nof either $18\\pm1M_J$ or $20\\pm1M_J$. This is the lowest isolated-object mass\nmeasurement to date, only $\\sim$45\\% more massive than the theoretical\ndeuterium-fusion boundary at solar metallicity, which is the common definition\nof a free-floating planet. The brown dwarf is located at either $3.9\\pm0.1$ kpc\nor $4.1\\pm0.1$ kpc toward the Galactic bulge, but with proper motion in the\nopposite direction of disk stars, with one solution suggesting it is moving\nwithin the Galactic plane. While it is possibly a halo brown dwarf, it might\nalso represent a different, unknown population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

These constraints follow from the recognition that\nsuch particles can be captured by - and thermalized within - the Earth, leading\nto a substantial accumulation and concentration of DM that interact with\nbaryons. Here, we discuss the probability that DM intercepted by the Earth will\nbe captured, the number of DM particles thereby accumulated over Earth's\nlifetime, the fraction of such particles retained in the face of evaporation,\nand the density distribution of such particles within the Earth. In the latter\ncontext, we note that a previous treatment of the density distribution of DM,\npresented by Gould and Raffelt and applied subsequently to DM in the Sun, is\ninconsistent with considerations of hydrostatic equilibrium.

Numerical calculations have\nshown that, at certain discrete angles called magic angles, the low energy\nbands become flat leading to localization of electrons. The origin of this\nstrange behavior, however, is not well understood. Here, I propose a theory\nthat offers an understanding of the phenomenon, focusing on the first magic\nangle. It is shown that coupling between the layers, in addition to\nrenormalizing the Dirac velocity, introduces higher order momentum terms in the\nenergy dispersion that are not all of the same sign. Partial cancellation among\nthese terms leads to the flatness of the low energy bands. Also, while there is\nmodulation of electron density in real space, there is no localization---the\nmodulation arises due to the superposition of plane wave states with different\nmomenta in the two layers. In addition, it is conjectured that there is an\nunderlying geometric reason for the appearance of more than one magic angle\nwhich can be exploited to predict higher magic angles approximately without\ncomputing the band structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 18:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

Observations suggest that\ntoroidal flux concentrations often referred to as \"flux tubes\", rise from their\nregion of initiation likely in the solar tachocline towards the solar surface\ndue to magnetic buoyancy. Many studies have assumed the existence of such\nmagnetic structures and studied the buoyant rise of an isolated flux tube in a\nquiescent, field-free environment. Here, motivated by their formation (Cline et\nal. 2003; Brummell et al. 2002), we relax the latter assumption and study the\nrise of a toroidal flux tube embedded in a large-scale poloidal background\nmagnetic field. We find that the presence of the large-scale background field\nseverely affects the dynamics of the rising tube. A relatively weak background\nfield, as low as 6% of the tube strength, can destroy the rise of a tube that\nwould otherwise rise in the absence of the background field. Surprisingly, the\nrise of tubes with one sign of the twist is suppressed by a significantly\nweaker background field than the other. This demonstrates a potential mechanism\nfor the selection of the preferred helicity of rising and emerging tubes for\nthe solar case that is commensurate with many features of the hemispherical\nrule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 18:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

We leverage\ntools from operator-valued kernels and the associated vector-valued RKHSs that\nprovide an explicit control over the role of the hyperparameters, and also\nallows us to consider new type of constraints. We provide generalization\nguarantees to the suggested scheme and illustrate its efficiency in\ncost-sensitive classification, quantile regression and density level set\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 18:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 15:45:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 09:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

However,\nthe basis of how these image translation models work is through matching the\ntranslation output to the distribution of the target domain.

When the output of an\nalgorithm is a transformed image there are uncertainties whether all known and\nunknown class labels have been preserved or changed. Therefore, we recommend\nthat these translated images should not be used for direct interpretation (e.g.\nby doctors) because they may lead to misdiagnosis of patients based on\nhallucinated image features by an algorithm that matches a distribution.\nHowever there are many recent papers that seem as though this is the goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 20:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 22:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 05:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

In this work, we propose to model counterfactual\ndistributions using a novel Hilbert space representation called counterfactual\nmean embedding (CME). The CME embeds the associated counterfactual distribution\ninto a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) endowed with a positive definite\nkernel, which allows us to perform causal inference over the entire landscape\nof the counterfactual distribution. Based on this representation, we propose a\ndistributional treatment effect (DTE) that can quantify the causal effect over\nentire outcome distributions.

We discuss gluonic tube\nstring collisions in the context of two examples: electron-proton scattering at\na future electron-ion collider or the peripheral scattering of protons\naccessible at the LHC.

A DLD device optimized\nfor efficient cell sorting enables rapid medical diagnoses of several diseases\nsuch as malaria since infected cells are stiffer than their healthy\ncounterparts. The device consists of pillar arrays in which pillar rows are\ntilted and hence are not orthogonal to the columns.

We compare the results of hydrodynamical simulations with analytic\npredictions. Our two-dimensional (2D) simulations indicate that the torque\nacting on a perturber with softening radius $R_{\\rm soft}$ can be accounted for\nby a scattering approach if $R_{\\rm soft}<0.3H$, where $H$ is defined as the\nratio between the sound speed and the angular velocity at the orbital radius of\nthe perturber.

In this\nwork, we place a superconducting transmon qubit in one arm of an on-chip\nMach-Zehnder interferometer composed of two superconducting microwave beam\nsplitters. By measuring its relaxation and dephasing rates we use the qubit as\na sensitive spectrometer at the quantum level to probe the broadband\nelectromagnetic environment. At high frequencies, this environment can be well\ndescribed by an ensemble of harmonic oscillators coupled to the transmon qubit.\nAt low frequencies, we find experimental evidence for colored quasi-static\nGaussian noise with a high spectral weight, as it is typical for ensembles of\ntwo-level fluctuators. Our work paves the way towards possible applications of\npropagating microwave photons, such as emulating quantum impurity models or a\nnovel architecture for quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 20:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 14:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

While this approach has been successfully\napplied to a variety of domains, it comes with limitations. The reason is that\nthere are many other applications in which only \\emph{multi}-way similarity\nmeasures are available. This motivates us to explore the multi-way measurement\nsetting. In this work, we develop two algorithms intended for such setting:\nHypergraph Spectral Clustering (HSC) and Hypergraph Spectral Clustering with\nLocal Refinement (HSCLR). Our main contribution lies in performance analysis of\nthe poly-time algorithms under a random hypergraph model, which we name the\nweighted stochastic block model, in which objects and multi-way measures are\nmodeled as nodes and weights of hyperedges, respectively. Denoting by $n$ the\nnumber of nodes, our analysis reveals the following: (1) HSC outputs a\npartition which is better than a random guess if the sum of edge weights (to be\nexplained later) is $\\Omega(n)$; (2) HSC outputs a partition which coincides\nwith the hidden partition except for a vanishing fraction of nodes if the sum\nof edge weights is $\\omega(n)$; and (3) HSCLR exactly recovers the hidden\npartition if the sum of edge weights is on the order of $n \\log n$. Our results\nimprove upon the state of the arts recently established under the model and\nthey firstly settle the order-wise optimal results for the binary edge weight\ncase. Moreover, we show that our results lead to efficient sketching algorithms\nfor subspace clustering, a computer vision application. Lastly, we show that\nHSCLR achieves the information-theoretic limits for a special yet practically\nrelevant model, thereby showing no computational barrier for the case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 04:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

Recently, a deep\nlearning technology has been successfully applied to medical image analysis\nincluding CADx. Existing deep learning based CADx approaches, however, have a\nlimitation in explaining the diagnostic decision. In real clinical practice,\nclinical decisions could be made with reasonable explanation. So current deep\nlearning approaches in CADx are limited in real world deployment. In this\npaper, we investigate interpretability in CADx with the proposed interpretable\nCADx (ICADx) framework. The proposed framework is devised with a generative\nadversarial network, which consists of interpretable diagnosis network and\nsynthetic lesion generative network to learn the relationship between\nmalignancy and a standardized description (BI-RADS). The lesion generative\nnetwork and the interpretable diagnosis network compete in an adversarial\nlearning so that the two networks are improved. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method was validated on public mammogram database. Experimental\nresults showed that the proposed ICADx framework could provide the\ninterpretability of mass as well as mass classification. It was mainly\nattributed to the fact that the proposed method was effectively trained to find\nthe relationship between malignancy and interpretations via the adversarial\nlearning. These results imply that the proposed ICADx framework could be a\npromising approach to develop the CADx system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 04:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

We focus on\nblind spots in reinforcement learning (RL) that occur due to incomplete state\nrepresentation: The agent does not have the appropriate features to represent\nthe true state of the world and thus cannot distinguish among numerous states.\nWe formalize the problem of discovering blind spots in RL as a noisy supervised\nlearning problem with class imbalance. We learn models to predict blind spots\nin unseen regions of the state space by combining techniques for label\naggregation, calibration, and supervised learning. The models take into\nconsideration noise emerging from different forms of oracle feedback, including\ndemonstrations and corrections.

In\nthis article, we investigate the use of graphical processing units (GPUs) to\nparallelize such schemes and thereby further increase their effectiveness.\nAccording to our numerical experiments, large speed-ups are often observed for\nsufficiently large matrices. We also provide a comparison between different\nsplitting strategies, demonstrating that splitting the equations into a\nmoderate number of subproblems is generally optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 07:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 07:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

In the context of hierarchical matrices, this\noperation can be realized by the multiplication of structured block-wise\nlow-rank matrices, resulting in an almost linear cost. However, the\ncomputational efficiency of the algorithm is based on a recursive scheme which\nmakes the error analysis quite involved. In this article, we propose a new\nalgorithmic framework for the multiplication of hierarchical matrices. It\nimproves currently known implementations by reducing the multiplication of\nhierarchical matrices towards finding a suitable low-rank approximation of sums\nof matrix-products.

A cost analysis shows that, under reasonable\nassumptions on the low-rank approximation method, the cost of the framework is\nalmost linear with respect to the size of the matrix. Numerical experiments\nshow that the new approach produces indeed the best-approximation of the\nproduct of hierarchical matrices for a given tolerance.

We\npresent and review a theory independent approach in holography to study such\nphenomena. We firstly argue that the heavy quark diffusion occurs in realistic\nstrongly coupled systems. Then we analyze the quantum and thermal fluctuation,\ndissipation and the corresponding Brownian motion of a heavy particle in such\nenvironments for a wide class of theories. The holographic study is based on\nthe properties of the straight string fluctuations. The observables and\ncoefficients associated with the stochastic motion depend on a single parameter\nwhich encodes the properties of the different theories. Moreover, certain\nDp-brane fluctuations can be mapped one-to-one to the string fluctuations and\ntherefore the stochastic brane observables can be read from the string ones.\n  Then we review the Langevin diffusion of a moving heavy quark in generic\nthermal holographic theories. The analysis is based on the properties of the\ntrailing string and its fluctuations. The string world-sheet has a black hole\nhorizon and the quark feels an effective temperature different than the\nenvironmental one. The formulas of the effective temperature, the drag force on\nthe particle and the Langevin coefficients are given in terms of the background\nmetric elements readily applicable to any theory. At the end we comment on the\nbackreaction effects on the medium and present results of the Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 08:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

Specifically, we will solve a quadratic\nprogramming (QP) relaxation using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and a linear\nprogramming (LP) relaxation by developing a proximal minimisation framework. By\nexploiting labelling consistency in the higher-order potentials and utilising\nthe filter-based method, we are able to formulate the above algorithms such\nthat each iteration has a complexity linear in the number of classes and random\nvariables. The presented algorithms can be applied to any labelling problem\nusing a dense CRF with sparse higher-order potentials. In this paper, we use\nsemantic segmentation as an example application as it demonstrates the ability\nof the algorithm to scale to dense CRFs with large dimensions. We perform\nexperiments on the Pascal dataset to indicate that the presented algorithms are\nable to attain lower energies than the mean-field inference method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 09:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 11:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

It\nwas recently proved in our previous work \\cite{XZZ18} that the obstacle can be\nuniquely determined by the phaseless far-field patterns generated by infinitely\nmany sets of superpositions of two plane waves with different directions at a\nfixed frequency if the obstacle is a priori known to be a sound-soft or an\nimpedance obstacle with real-valued impedance function.

An oriented cohomology theory in\nthe sense of Levin-Morel is called $p^n$-typical if its corresponding formal\ngroup law is $p^n$-typical. The main result of the paper is the construction of\n'Chern classes' from the algebraic $n$-th Morava K-theory to every\n$p^n$-typical oriented cohomology theory.\n  If the coefficient ring of a $p^n$-typical theory is a free\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-module we also prove that these Chern classes freely\ngenerate all operations to it.

We are interested in the guessing efficiency, which we define as the\nbest possible multiplicative reduction in Alice's guessing-moments obtainable\nby observing Bob's bit. For the case of a uniform binary vector observed\nthrough a binary symmetric channel, we provide two lower bounds on the guessing\nefficiency by analyzing the performance of the Dictator and Majority functions,\nand two upper bounds via maximum entropy and Fourier-analytic /\nhypercontractivity arguments.

In a setting\nwith unhedgeable mortality risk and complete financial market, the optimal\nsolution is given explicitly for contracts with mortality risk using a\nmartingale approach for constrained non-concave optimization problems. We show\nthat regulatory VaR constraints for participating insurance contracts lead to\nmore prudent investment than in the case of no regulation. This result is\ncontrary to the situation where the insurer maximizes the utility of the total\nwealth of the company (without distinguishing between contributions of equity\nholders and policyholders), in which case a VaR constraint may induce the\ninsurer to take excessive risks leading to higher losses than in the case of no\nregulation. Compared to the unregulated problem, the VaR-constrained strategy\nleads to a higher expected utility for the policyholders, highlighting the\npotential usefulness of a VaR-regulation in the context of insurance. The\nprudent investment behavior is more significant if a VaR-type regulation is\nreplaced by a portfolio insurance (PI)-type regulation. Furthermore, a stricter\nregulation (a smaller allowed default probability in the VaR problem or a\nhigher minimum guarantee level in the PI problem) enhances the benefit of the\npolicyholder but deteriorates that of the insurer. For both types of\nregulation, the gains in terms of expected utility are greater for higher\nparticipation rates, while being smaller for higher bonus rates.

In the studies of\nstochastic thermodynamics, some thermodynamic quantities, such as the\ntrajectory work, associated with the complete Langevin equation (the Kramers\nequation) are often assumed to converge to those associated with the overdamped\nLangevin equation (the Smoluchowski equation) in the overdamped limit under the\noverdamped approximation. Nevertheless, a rigorous mathematical proof of the\nconvergence of the work distributions to our knowledge has not been reported so\nfar. Here we study the convergence of the work distributions explicitly. In the\noverdamped limit, we rigorously prove the convergence of the extended\nFokker-Planck equations including work using a multiple timescale expansion\napproach. By taking the linearly dragged harmonic oscillator as an exactly\nsolvable example, we analytically calculate the work distribution associated\nwith the Kramers equation, and verify its convergence to that associated with\nthe Smoluchowski equation in the overdamped limit. We quantify the accuracy of\nthe overdamped approximation as a function of the damping coefficient. In\naddition, we experimentally demonstrate that the data of the work distribution\nof a levitated silica nanosphere agrees with the overdamped approximation in\nthe overdamped limit, but deviates from the overdamped approximation in the\nlow-damping case. Our work fills a gap between the stochastic thermodynamics\nbased on the complete Langevin equation (the Kramers equation) and the\noverdamped Langevin equation (the Smoluchowski equation), and deepens our\nunderstanding of the overdamped approximation in stochastic thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 12:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 14:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 04:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

In\nfact, building a corpus is a research topic that is currently referred to among\nsome other major themes of conferences, in Natural Language Processing (NLP),\nsuch as, Information Retrieval (IR), Question-Answering (QA), Automatic Summary\n(AS), etc. Generally, a question-answering system provides various passages to\nanswer the user questions. To make these passages truly informative, this\nsystem needs access to an underlying knowledge base; this requires the\nconstruction of a corpus. The aim of our research is to build an Arabic\nquestion-answering system. In addition, analyzing the question must be the\nfirst step. Next, it is essential to retrieve a passage from the web that can\nserve as an appropriate answer. In this paper, we propose a method to analysis\nthe question and retrieve the passage answer in the Arabic language. For the\nquestion analysis, five factual question types are processed. Additionally, our\npurpose is to experiment with the generation of a logic representation from the\ndeclarative form of each question. Several studies, deal with the logic\napproaches in question-answering, are discussed in other languages than the\nArabic language. This representation is very promising because it helps us\nlater in the selection of a justifiable answer. The accuracy of questions that\nare correctly analyzed and translated into the logic form achieved 64%. And\nthen, the results of passages of texts that are automatically generated\nachieved an 87% score for accuracy and a 98% score for c@1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 13:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

More precisely, it extends a vector field defined over\nany region to the rest of the domain via parallel transport along shortest\ngeodesics. This basic operation enables fast, robust algorithms for\nextrapolating level set velocities, inverting the exponential map, computing\ngeometric medians and Karcher/Fr\\'{e}chet means of arbitrary distributions,\nconstructing centroidal Voronoi diagrams, and finding consistently ordered\nlandmarks. Rather than evaluate parallel transport by explicitly tracing\ngeodesics, we show that it can be computed via a short-time heat flow involving\nthe connection Laplacian. As a result, transport can be achieved by solving\nthree prefactored linear systems, each akin to a standard Poisson problem. To\nimplement the method we need only a discrete connection Laplacian, which we\ndescribe for a variety of geometric data structures (point clouds, polygon\nmeshes, etc). We also study the numerical behavior of our method, showing\nempirically that it converges under refinement, and augment the construction of\nintrinsic Delaunay triangulations (iDT) so that they can be used in the context\nof tangent vector field processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 13:47:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 15:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 15:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

In previous\nworks, the capabilities of radar-based solutions for the re-entry predictions\nof GOCE and of similar objects were investigated, focusing on the german TIRA\nradar. In this work we have performed additional analysis, focusing on the\nnorthern european radar EISCAT-UHF, located in Troms\\o, Norway. This sensor,\nconceived for atmospheric studies, has recently been considered for space\ndebris applications. Due to its limited tracking capabilities, we are\ninterested in testing its effectiveness in supporting re-entry predictions. We\nhave simulated reliable re-entry prediction scenarios, with different\navailability of data from EISCAT and TIRA. The main conclusion is that,\nprovided a suitable amount of observations, EISCAT-based re-entry predictions\nare comparable to TIRA-based, but also to GPS and TLE-based, corresponding\nones. In general, EISCAT is not able to determine an orbit with the same\naccuracy of TIRA, but the results are equivalent in terms of re-entry\npredictions, if we consider the relevant parameters involved and their effects\non the re-entry time. What is very important is the difficulty in predicting\natmospheric and attitude significant variations in between the current epoch\nand the actual re-entry. Thus, it is not easy to keep the accuracy of\npredictions much lower than 10% of the residual lifetime, apart from cases with\nconstant area to mass ratio, and low atmospheric variations with respect to the\nmodels.

In particular, I look into various tests of Modified Newtonian\nDynamics (MOND), which posits a modification below a very low acceleration\nthreshold. Although discrepancies with Newtonian dynamics are indeed observed,\nthey can usually be explained by invoking an appropriate distribution of\ninvisible mass known as dark matter (DM). This leads to the standard\ncosmological paradigm, $\\Lambda$CDM. I consider how it may be distinguished\nfrom MOND using collision velocities of galaxy clusters, which should sometimes\nbe much faster in MOND. I focus on measuring these velocities more accurately\nand conclude that this test ought to be feasible in the near future.\n  For the time being, I look at the much nearer and more accurately observed\nLocal Group (LG) of galaxies. Its main constituents $-$ the Milky Way (MW) and\nAndromeda (M31) $-$ should have undergone a past close flyby in MOND but not in\n$\\Lambda$CDM. The fast MW-M31 relative motion around the time of their flyby\nwould have allowed them to gravitationally slingshot any passing LG dwarf\ngalaxies out at high speed.

Several candidates are found in two different\n$\\Lambda$CDM models of the LG, one written by a founding figure of the\nparadigm. The properties of these HVGs are similar to what might be expected in\nMOND, especially their tendency to lie close to a plane. Being more confident\nof its validity, I then used MOND to determine the escape velocity curve of the\nMW over the distance range 8$-$50 kpc, finding reasonable agreement with the\nlatest observations.

This FMR response can be\nsubtracted to yield images of the bullet mode.

Although data has been collected since 1989, this\nis the first time the spatio-temporal modelling for entire Germany has been\ncarried out.

The\nstudy indicates a strong association between drought stress and defoliation of\nall four main tree species. Besides direct effects of weather conditions,\nindirect effects seem to play a further role. Defoliation of the comparably\ndrought-tolerant species pine and oak was primarily affected by insect\ninfestations following drought whereas considerable time for regeneration was\nrequired by beech following drought stress and recurring substantial\nfructification.

Exact methods for light nuclei are now\nable to include continuum degrees of freedom and treat structure and reactions\non the same footing, and multiple approximate, computationally efficient\nmany-body methods have been developed that can be routinely applied for\nmedium-mass nuclei. This has made it possible to confront modern nuclear\ninteractions from Chiral Effective Field Theory, that are rooted in Quantum\nChromodynamics with a wealth of experimental data. Here, we discuss one of\nthese efficient new many-body methods, the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization\nGroup (IMSRG), and its applications in modern nuclear structure theory. The\nIMSRG evolves the nuclear many-body Hamiltonian in second-quantized form\nthrough continuous unitary transformations that can be implemented with\npolynomial computational effort. Through suitably chosen generators, we drive\nthe matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in configuration space to specific\nshapes, e.g., to implement a decoupling of low- and high-energy scales, or to\nextract energy eigenvalues for a given nucleus. We present selected results\nfrom Multireference IMSRG (MR-IMSRG) calculations of open-shell nuclei, as well\nas proof-of-principle applications for intrinsically deformed medium-mass\nnuclei. We discuss the successes and prospects of merging the (MR-)IMSRG with\nmany-body methods ranging from Configuration Interaction to the Density Matrix\nRenormalization Group, with the goal of achieving an efficient simultaneous\ndescription of dynamic and static correlations in atomic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 15:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Recurrent Highway\nNetworks (RHNs) were introduced in order to tackle this issue. These have\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on a few benchmarks using a depth of 10\nlayers. However, the performance of this architecture suffers from a\nbottleneck, and ceases to improve when an attempt is made to add more layers.\nIn this work, we analyze the causes for this, and postulate that the main\nsource is the way that the information flows through time. We introduce a novel\nand simple variation for the RHN cell, called Highway State Gating (HSG), which\nallows adding more layers, while continuing to improve performance. By using a\ngating mechanism for the state, we allow the net to \"choose\" whether to pass\ninformation directly through time, or to gate it. This mechanism also allows\nthe gradient to back-propagate directly through time and, therefore, results in\na slightly faster convergence. We use the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset as a\nplatform for empirical proof of concept. Empirical results show that the\nimprovement due to Highway State Gating is for all depths, and as the depth\nincreases, the improvement also increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 15:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

The 4DVar seeks a solution that minimizes the departure\nfrom the background field and the mismatch between the forecast trajectory and\nthe observations within an assimilation window. The current state-of-the-art\n4DVar offers only two choices by using different forms of the forecast model:\nthe strong- and weak-constrained 4DVar approaches15-16. The former ignores the\nmodel error and only corrects the initial condition error at the expense of\nreduced accuracy; while the latter accounts for both the initial and model\nerrors and corrects them separately, which increases computational costs and\nuncertainty. To overcome these limitations, here we develop an integral\ncorrecting 4DVar (i4DVar) approach by treating all errors as a whole and\ncorrecting them simultaneously and indiscriminately. To achieve that, a novel\nexponentially decaying function is proposed to characterize the error evolution\nand correct it at each time step in the i4DVar. As a result, the i4DVar greatly\nenhances the capability of the strong-constrained 4DVar for correcting the\nmodel error while also overcomes the limitation of the weak-constrained 4DVar\nfor being prohibitively expensive with added uncertainty. Numerical experiments\nwith the Lorenz model show that the i4DVar significantly outperforms the\nexisting 4DVar approaches. It has the potential to be applied in many\nscientific and engineering fields and industrial sectors in the big data era\nbecause of its ease of implementation and superior performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 08:20:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 01:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

This project aims\nto predict the decision parameters using two ways and afterwards giving advice\non whether a patient needs treatment or not. In one way, we use clinically\nmeasured parameters such as Ankle Dorsiflexion, age, walking speed, step\nlength, stride length, weight over height squared (BMI) and etc. to predict the\ndecision parameters. In a second way, we use videos recorded from patient's\nwalking tests in a clinic in order to extract the coordinates of the joints of\nthe patient over time and predict the decision parameters. Finally, having the\ndecision parameters we pre-classify gait disorder intensity of a patient and as\nthe result make decisions on whether a patient needs treatment or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 17:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

A thorough investigation of the current literature reveals\nthat there are numerous applications attempting to overcome the limitations of\nLego platform which, however, appear to only partially succeed in significantly\nimproving children's engagement in fruitful learning. Their main limitations\nare that they either function on an elemental level or suffer from a general\nlack of creating effectively room for children to test their abilities and\nother curiosities. Aiming at confronting these limitations, the proposed\nandroid application, which is referred to as MyNXT, was created and presented.\nMyNXT offers direct access control along with the choice to program using\nsimple linear logic through an easy and a user friendly environment with built\nin instructions for all ages. Concluding, the proposed application constitutes\na stepping to an educating platform, which can facilitate the learning needs of\nchildren in contemporary times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 14:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}
