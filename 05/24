While energy spectra of accelerated electrons often\nexhibit a power law, it remains unclear how electrons are accelerated to high\nenergies and what processes determine the power-law index $\\delta$. Here, we\nreview previous observations of the power-law index $\\delta$ in a variety of\ndifferent plasma environments with a particular focus on sub-relativistic\nelectrons. It appears that in regions more closely related to magnetic\nreconnection (such as the `above-the-looptop' solar hard X-ray source and the\nplasma sheet in Earth's magnetotail), the spectra are typically soft ($\\delta\n\\gtrsim$ 4). This is in contrast to the typically hard spectra ($\\delta\n\\lesssim$ 4) that are observed in coincidence with shocks. The difference\nimplies that shocks are more efficient in producing a larger non-thermal\nfraction of electron energies when compared to magnetic reconnection. A caveat\nis that during active times in Earth's magnetotail, $\\delta$ values seem\nspatially uniform in the plasma sheet, while power-law distributions still\nexist even in quiet times. The role of magnetotail reconnection in the electron\npower-law formation could therefore be confounded with these background\nconditions. Because different regions have been studied with different\ninstrumentations and methodologies, we point out a need for more systematic and\ncoordinated studies of power-law distributions for a better understanding of\npossible scaling laws in particle acceleration as well as their universality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 16:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

The aim of this paper is to conclude this\nprogramme in a natural class of $C^3$ mappings. Examples of such rigidity were\nestablished previously, but not, for example, for real polynomials with\nnon-real critical points.\n  Our results are also new for analytic mappings. The main new ingredients of\nthe proof in the real analytic case are (i) the existence of infinitely many\n(complex) domains associated to its complex analytic extension so that these\ndomains and their ranges are compatible, (ii) a methodology for showing that\ncombinatorially equivalent complex box mappings are qc conjugate, (iii) a\nmethodology for constructing qc conjugacies in the presence of parabolic\nperiodic points.\n  For a $C^3$ mapping, the dilatation of a high iterate of any complex\nextension of the real map will in general be unbounded. To deal with this, we\nintroduce dynamically defined $qc\\backslash bg$ $partitions$, where the\nappropriate mapping has bounded quasiconformal dilatation, except on sets with\n\"bounded geometry\". To obtain such a partition we prove that we have very good\ngeometric control for infinitely many dynamically defined domains. Some of\nthese results are new even for real polynomials, and in fact an important\nsequence of domains turn out to be quasidiscs.

We use New Horizons data and models to estimate\nthe amounts of N2 in the following exterior reservoirs: atmosphere, escape,\nphotochemistry, and surface. The total exterior inventory is deduced to be\ndominated by a glacial sheet of N2-rich ices at Sputnik Planitia, or by\natmospheric escape if past rates of escape were much faster than at present.\nPluto's atmosphere is a negligible reservoir of N2, and photochemical\ndestruction of N2 may also be of little consequence. Estimates are made of the\namount of N2 accreted by Pluto based on cometary and solar compositions. It is\nfound that the cometary model can account for the amount of N2 in Sputnik\nPlanitia, while the solar model can provide a large initial inventory of N2\nthat would make prodigious atmospheric escape possible. These consistencies can\nbe considered preliminary evidence in support of a primordial origin of Pluto's\nN2. However, both models predict accreted ratios of CO/N2 that are much higher\nthan that in Pluto's atmosphere. Possible processes to explain \"missing CO\"\nthat are given quantitative support here are fractional crystallization from\nthe atmosphere resulting in CO burial at the surface, and aqueous destruction\nreactions of CO subject to metastable thermodynamic equilibrium in the\nsubsurface. The plausibility of primordial N2 as the primary source of Pluto's\nnitrogen (vs. NH3 or organic N) can be tested more rigorously using future\nconstraints on the 14N/15N ratio in N2 and the 36Ar/N2 ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 17:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

The transition from glass-like to grain-boundary-mediated\nplasticity can be classified into three regimes: (1) For low crystalline volume\nfractions, the system resembles a glass-crystal composite and plastic flow is\nlocalised in the amorphous phase; (2) with increasing crystalline volume\nfraction, clusters of crystallites become jammed and the mechanical response\ndepends critically on the relaxation state of the glassy grain boundaries; (3)\nat grain sizes $\\geq$ 10 nm, the system is jammed completely, prohibiting pure\ngrain-boundary plasticity and instead leading to co-deformation. We observe an\ninverse Hall-Petch effect only in the second regime when the grain boundary is\nnot deeply relaxed. Experimental results with different grain boundary states\nare therefore not directly comparable in this regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 17:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 09:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

Instead of processing every pixel\nin an image pyramid, SNIPER processes context regions around ground-truth\ninstances (referred to as chips) at the appropriate scale. For background\nsampling, these context-regions are generated using proposals extracted from a\nregion proposal network trained with a short learning schedule. Hence, the\nnumber of chips generated per image during training adaptively changes based on\nthe scene complexity. SNIPER only processes 30% more pixels compared to the\ncommonly used single scale training at 800x1333 pixels on the COCO dataset.\nBut, it also observes samples from extreme resolutions of the image pyramid,\nlike 1400x2000 pixels.

Therefore it can benefit from batch-normalization\nduring training without the need for synchronizing batch-normalization\nstatistics across GPUs.

While much of the\nefforts have traditionally been directed at geometrically frustrated\nantiferromagnets, recent studies reveal that systems featuring competing\nantiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions are also promising candidate\nmaterials. We find that this competition leads to the notion of special\ntemperatures, analogous to those of gases, at which the competing interactions\nbalance, and the system is quasi-ideal. Although induced by weak perturbing\ninteractions, these special temperatures are surprisingly high and constitute\nan accessible experimental diagnostic of eventual order or spin liquid\nproperties. The well characterised Hamiltonian and extended low-temperature\nsusceptibility measurement of the canonical frustrated ferromagnet\nDy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ enables us to formulate both a phenomenological and\nmicroscopic theory of special temperatures for magnets.

We propose\nthat the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by\nthe time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic\nfield lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may\nhave their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the\nmagneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized\nby an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it\nis a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form\nbetween the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers\nfurther jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of\nstripe widths $l>l_{\\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\\rm min}$. We find\nthat the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the\nstripes, is very gradual.

The prolonged energy dissipation\naccounts for the flat-to-inverted long-wavelength spectra commonly observed in\njets. The model can also account for the broad range of flaring timescales of\nblazars and the fact that their bulk acceleration appears to continue out to\n~100 pc scales. In GRB jets, the model predicts comparable power for the\nphotopsheric and Thomson-thin emission components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 18:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

It has\nlong been realized that the scattering screens responsible for the\nscintillation could be used as `interstellar lenses' to localize pulsar\nemission regions. Most scattering screens, however, only marginally resolve\nemission components, limiting results to statistical inferences and detections\nof small positional shifts. Since screens situated close to the source have\nbetter resolution, it should be easier to resolve emission regions of pulsars\nlocated in high density environments such as supernova remnants or binaries in\nwhich the pulsar's companion has an ionized outflow. Here, we report events of\nextreme plasma lensing in the `Black Widow' pulsar, PSR~B1957+20, near the\nphase in its 9.2 hour orbit in which its emission is eclipsed by its\ncompanion's outflow. During the lensing events, the flux is enhanced by factors\nof up to 70--80 at specific frequencies. The strongest events clearly resolve\nthe emission regions: they affect the narrow main pulse and parts of the wider\ninterpulse differently. We show that the events arise naturally from density\nfluctuations in the outer regions of the outflow, and infer a resolution of our\nlenses comparable to the pulsar's radius, about 10\\,km. Furthermore, the\ndistinct frequency structures imparted by the lensing are reminiscent of what\nis observed for the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102, providing\nobservational support for the idea that this source is observed through, and\nthus at times strongly magnified by, plasma lenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 18:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

The main\ncontribution of this paper is to relax the sequential randomization assumption\nwidely used in the biostatistics literature by introducing a flexible\nchoice-theoretic framework for a sequence of endogenous treatments.

The success of the residual matter expulsion or its retention within\nyoung stellar clusters has also a fundamental importance in order to understand\nhow star formation proceeds in present-day and ancient star-forming galaxies\nand if proto-globular clusters with multiple stellar populations are formed in\nthe present epoch. It is usually suggested that either the residual gas is\nrapidly ejected from star-forming clouds by stellar winds and supernova\nexplosions, or that the enrichment of the residual gas and the formation of the\nsecond stellar generation occur so rapidly, that the negative stellar feedback\nis not significant. Here we continue our study of the early development of star\nclusters in the extreme environments and discuss the restrictions that strong\nradiative cooling and stellar mass segregation provide on the gas expulsion\nfrom dense star-forming clouds. A large range of physical initial conditions in\nstar-forming clouds which include the star-forming cloud mass, compactness, gas\nmetallicity, star formation efficiency and effects of massive stars segregation\nare discussed. It is shown that in sufficiently massive and compact clusters\nhot shocked winds around individual massive stars may cool before merging with\ntheir neighbors. This dramatically reduces the negative stellar feedback,\nprevents the development of the global star cluster wind and expulsion of the\nresidual and the processed matter into the ambient interstellar medium.

While nebular gas from the protoplanetary disk was still present,\nJupiter may have migrated inwards and tacked at 1.5 AU in a 3:2 resonance with\nSaturn. This migration excited planetary building blocks in the inner solar\nsystem, resulting in extensive mixing and planetesimal removal. Here we\nevaluate the plausible nature of Mars' building blocks, focusing in particular\non how its growth was influenced by the formation and migration of Jupiter. We\nuse a combination of dynamical simulations and an isotopic mixing model that\ntraces the accretion of elements with different affinities for metal. Dynamical\nsimulations show that Jupiter's migration causes the late stages of Earth's and\nMars' accretion to be dominated by EC-type (enstatite chondrite) material due\nto the loss of OC (ordinary chondrite) planetesimals. Our analysis of available\nisotopic data for SNC meteorites shows that Mars consists of approximately\n68%$^{+0}_{-39}$ EC + 32%$^{+35}_{-0}$ OC by mass (2{\\sigma}). The large\nuncertainties indicate that isotopic analyses of martian samples are for the\nmost part too imprecise to definitely test model predictions; in particular it\nremains uncertain whether or not Mars accreted predominantly EC material in the\nlatter stages of its formation history. Dynamical simulations also provide no\ndefinitive constraint on Mars' accretion history due to the great variety of\ndynamical pathways that the martian embryo exhibits. The present work calls for\nnew measurements of isotopic anomalies in SNC meteorites targeting siderophile\nelements (most notably Ni, Mo and Ru) to constrain Mars' accretion history and\nits formation location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 22:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

The underlying framework for all\nthese models is usually a deep neural network comprising an encoder and a\ndecoder. Although simple encoder-decoder models produce competitive results,\nmany researchers have proposed additional improvements over these\nsequence-to-sequence models, e.g., using an attention-based model over the\ninput, pointer-generation models, and self-attention models. However, such\nseq2seq models suffer from two common problems: 1) exposure bias and 2)\ninconsistency between train/test measurement. Recently, a completely novel\npoint of view has emerged in addressing these two problems in seq2seq models,\nleveraging methods from reinforcement learning (RL).

Both of these results improve upon prior work [Bian\net al, 2017, Soma and Yoshida, 2017].\n  Our first algorithm uses novel ideas such as reducing the guaranteed\napproximation problem to analyzing a zero-sum game for each coordinate, and\nincorporates the geometry of this zero-sum game to fix the value at this\ncoordinate. Our second algorithm exploits coordinate-wise concavity to identify\na monotone equilibrium condition sufficient for getting the required\napproximation guarantee, and hunts for the equilibrium point using binary\nsearch. We further run experiments to verify the performance of our proposed\nalgorithms in related machine learning applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 02:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

We used\nnetwork biology techniques to quantitatively assess the impact of environmental\ncontaminants on the human interactome and diseases with a particular focus on\nseven major contaminant categories: persistent organic pollutants (POPs),\ndioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides,\nperfluorochemicals (PFCs), metals, and pharmaceutical and personal care\nproducts (PPCPs). We integrated publicly available data on toxicogenomics, the\ndiseasome, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and gene essentiality and found\nthat a few contaminants were targeted to many genes, and a few genes were\ntargeted by many contaminants. The contaminant targets were hub proteins in the\nhuman PPI network, whereas the target proteins in most categories did not\ncontain abundant essential proteins. Generally, contaminant targets and\ndisease-associated proteins were closely associated with the PPI network, and\nthe closeness of the associations depended on the disease type and chemical\ncategory. Network biology techniques were used to identify environmental\ncontaminants with broad effects on the human interactome and\ncontaminant-sensitive biomarkers. Moreover, this method enabled us to quantify\nthe relationship between environmental contaminants and human diseases, which\nwas supported by epidemiological and experimental evidence. These methods and\nfindings have facilitated the elucidation of the complex relationship between\nenvironmental exposure and adverse health outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 03:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

Specifically, we study the\nintensity of radiation penetrating an infinite, uniform slab of material that\nabsorbs and scatters the radiation with equal probability. The basic Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer method, without any biasing mechanisms, starts to\nbreak down for transverse optical depths above ~20 because so few of the\nsimulated photon packets reach the other side of the slab.

This manuscript is a report of a systematic exploration\nof the time-dependent photophysical processes that occur upon photoexcitation\nof a type-II heterojunction between the polymer PTB7 and monolayer MoS2. In\nparticular, photoinduced electron transfer from PTB7 to electronically hot\nstates of MoS2 occurs in less than 250 fs.

The\nequilibrium between excitons and polaron pairs in PTB7 determines the charge\nseparation yield, whereas the 3-4 ns lifetime of photogenerated carriers is\nlimited by MoS2 defects.

To recover the point sources, we propose to\nsolve a convex feasibility program, which simply finds a nonnegative Borel\nmeasure that agrees with the observations collected by the imaging device.\n  In the absence of imaging noise, we show that solving this convex program\nuniquely retrieves the point sources, provided that the imaging device collects\nenough observations. This result holds true if the point spread function of the\nimaging device can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, and\nif the translations of these components form a Chebyshev system, i.e., a system\nof continuous functions that loosely behave like algebraic polynomials.\n  Building upon recent results for one-dimensional signals [1], we prove that\nthis super-resolution algorithm is stable, in the generalized Wasserstein\nmetric, to model mismatch (i.e., when the image is not sparse) and to additive\nimaging noise. In particular, the recovery error depends on the noise level and\nhow well the image can be approximated with well-separated point sources. As an\nexample, we verify these claims for the important case of a Gaussian point\nspread function. The proofs rely on the construction of novel interpolating\npolynomials---which are the main technical contribution of this paper---and\npartially resolve the question raised in [2] about the extension of the\nstandard machinery to higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 05:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 01:37:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 07:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Furthermore, the\ntransformation in this formalism can be fully expressed at order $\\hbar^0$ and\nso does not qualify as a candidate quantum phenomenon. In particular, we find\nthat the Grassmann WWM formalism at order $\\hbar^0$ corresponds to an\nontological model governed by an additional set of constraints arising from the\nrelations defining the Grassmann algebra. Due to this additional set of\nconstraints, the allowed probability distributions in this model do not form a\nsingle convex set when expressed in terms of disjoint ontic states and so\ncannot be mapped to models whose states form a single convex set over disjoint\nontic states.

From the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$-dependent ground state\nof stoichiometric SrCoO$_{3}$, we show the proximity of its metallic\nferromagnetic ground state to other antiferromagnetic states. The structural\nand magnetic properties of SrCoO$_{3-\\delta}$ depending on their oxygen-content\nprovide an interesting insight into the relationship between the Co-Co\ndistances and the magnetic couplings so that the spin-state transition of Co\nspins can understood by the change of $pd$-hybridization depending on the Co-Co\ndistances.

Based on the experiences and\nknow-how acquired in our previous experiments, We collected data for rotation\nfrequencies up to 510Hz in both directions of rotation and also used different\nslits. For each run with high rotation, we observed a stable statistically\nsignificant relative shift between the spectra of the two states with opposite\nacceleration. This indicates the influence of acceleration on time dilation.\nHowever, we found that this shift also depends on the choice of the slit, and\non the direction of rotation. These new unexpected findings, resulting from the\nloss of symmetry in obtaining the resonant lines in the two states, could\novershadow the relative shift due to acceleration. This loss of the symmetry is\ncaused by the deflection of the radiative decay due to the Nuclear Lighthouse\neffect from the rotating Mossbauer absorber. We also found that it is\nimpossible to keep the alignment (between the optical and the dynamical rotor\nsystems) with accuracy needed for such experiment, for long runs, which\nresulted in the reduction of the accuracy of the observed relative shift.

The notion of periodic two-scale convergence has been\nextended in different ways to the stochastic case.

In particular it allows to characterize the notion of stochastic\ntwo-scale convergence in the mean by mere weak convergence in an extended\nspace. We illustrate the method on the (classical) example of stochastic\nhomogenization of convex integral functionals, and prove a new result on\nstochastic homogenization for a non-convex evolution equation of Allen-Cahn\ntype. Moreover, we discuss the relation of stochastic unfolding to previously\nintroduced notions of (quenched and mean) stochastic two-scale convergence.

However, pure collaborative filtering models have at\nleast one of the following limitations: (1) they can only extend playlists\nprofiled at training time; (2) they misrepresent songs that occur in very few\nplaylists. We introduce a novel hybrid playlist continuation model based on\nwhat we name \"playlist-song membership\", that is, whether a given playlist and\na given song fit together.

In light of this information, and\nafter having been trained on a collection of labeled playlist-song pairs, the\nproposed model decides whether a playlist-song pair fits together or not.\nExperimental results on two datasets of curated music playlists show that the\nproposed playlist continuation model compares to a state-of-the-art\ncollaborative filtering model in the ideal situation of extending playlists\nprofiled at training time and where songs occurred frequently in training\nplaylists. In contrast to the collaborative filtering model, and as a result of\nits general understanding of the playlist-song pairs in terms of feature\nvectors, the proposed model is additionally able to (1) extend non-profiled\nplaylists and (2) recommend songs that occurred seldom or never in\ntraining~playlists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 09:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

The difficulty in characterizing the\ninsulating state and its origin stems from the lack of a continuous mapping of\nthe superconducting to insulating phase diagram in a single sample. Here we use\nthe two-dimensional (2D) electron liquid formed at the interface between the\ntwo insulators (111) SrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$ to study the superconductor to\ninsulator transition. This crystalline interface surprisingly exhibits very\nstrong features previously observed only in amorphous systems.

Through examination of the field dependence of the sheet resistance and\ncomparison of the response to fields in different orientations we identify a\nnew magnetic field scale, H$_{pairing}$, where superconducting fluctuations are\nmuted.

The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is\nknown to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not\nalways lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to\nbecome hard and eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle.\nFor initially circular binaries, we show that the gravitational wave (GW)\nmerger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$ ($10^5$) in\n$10\\%$ ($1\\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the\ngrowth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the\neffective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned\nwith the binary orbital angular momentum. We find that binary orientations can\nflip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with\nlarge merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather\nflat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be\n$\\sim 0.6\\ \\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This mechanism is unlikely to be\nthe dominant formation channel of BH mergers. However, the current and\nnear-future GW observatories are expected to detect an enormous number of BH\nmergers.

For each individual cluster its chromosome map separates\nthe so-called first population -with metal abundance patterns typical of field\nhalo stars- from the second population, that displays distinctive abundance\nvariations among a specific group of light-elements. Surprisingly, the\ndistribution of first population stars in chromosome maps of several -but not\nall- clusters has been found to be more extended than expected from purely\nobservational errors, suggesting a chemically inhomogeneous origin.

The presence of a range of initial He and N\nabundances amongst stars traditionally thought to have homogeneous composition,\nplus the fact that these spreads appear only in some clusters, challenge the\nscenarios put forward so far to explain the multiple population phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 10:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

This is paralleled\nby an experimental focus on recording from trained animals, with few studies\nfollowing neural activity throughout training. In this work, we address this\ngap in the realm of artificial networks by analyzing networks that are trained\nto perform memory and pattern generation tasks. The functional aspect of these\ntasks corresponds to dynamical objects in the fully trained network - a line\nattractor or a set of limit cycles for the two respective tasks. We use these\ndynamical objects as anchors to study the effect of learning on their\nemergence. We find that the sequential nature of learning has major\nconsequences for the learning trajectory and its final outcome. Specifically,\nwe show that Least Mean Squares (LMS), a simple gradient descent suggested as a\nbiologically plausible version of the FORCE algorithm, is constantly obstructed\nby forgetting, which is manifested as the destruction of dynamical objects from\nprevious trials. The degree of interference is determined by the correlation\nbetween different trials. We show which specific ingredients of FORCE avoid\nthis phenomenon. Overall, this difference results in convergence that is orders\nof magnitude slower for LMS. Learning implies accumulating information across\nmultiple trials to form the overall concept of the task.

We assert that the problem of appearance\nof gauge non-invariant Feynman diagrams of hadronic structure of the neutron\nand proton is related to the following. The vertex of the effective V-A weak\ninteractions does not belong to the combined quantum field theory including the\nLsM and QED. We argue that gauge invariant set of Feynman diagrams of hadrons,\ncoupled to real and virtual photons in neutron beta decays, can be obtained\nwithin the combined quantum field theory including the Standard Electroweak\nModel (SEM) and the LsM, where the effective V-A vertex of weak interactions is\na result of the W^- - electroweak boson exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 14:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

We present measurements of the baryonic mass and specific angular\nmomentum of 11 void dwarf galaxies derived from neutral hydrogen (H{\\sc i})\nsynthesis data. Rotation curves were measured using 3D and 2D tilted ring\nfitting routines, and the derived curves generally overlap within the error\nbars, except in the central regions where, as expected, the 3D routines give\nsteeper curves. The specific angular momentum of void dwarfs is found to be\nhigh compared to an extrapolation of the trends seen for higher mass bulge-less\nspirals, but comparable to that of other dwarf irregular galaxies that lie\noutside of voids. As such, our data show no evidence for a dependence of the\nspecific angular momentum on the large scale environment. Combining our data\nwith the data from the literature, we find a baryonic threshold of $\\sim\n10^{9.1}~M_{\\odot}$ for this increase in specific angular momentum.\nInterestingly, this threshold is very similar to the mass threshold below which\nthe galaxy discs start to become systematically thicker. This provides\nqualitative support to the suggestion that the thickening of the discs, as well\nas the increase in specific angular momentum, are both results of a common\nphysical mechanism, such as feedback from star formation. Quantitatively,\nhowever, the amount of star formation observed in our dwarfs appears\ninsufficient to produce the observed increase in specific angular momentum. It\nis hence likely that other processes, such as cold accretion of high angular\nmomentum gas, also play a role in increasing the specific angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 15:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

When data exhibit non-overlap,\nestimation of these estimands requires reliance on model specifications, due to\npoor data support. All existing methods to address non-overlap, such as\ntrimming or down-weighting data in regions of poor support, change the\nestimand. In environmental health research, where study results are often\nintended to influence policy, changes in the estimand can diminish the study's\nimpact, because estimates may not be representative of effects in the\npopulation of interest to policymakers. Researchers may be willing to make\nadditional, minimal modeling assumptions in order to preserve the ability to\nestimate population average causal effects.

Second, we develop a novel\nBayesian framework to estimate population average causal effects with minor\nmodel dependence and appropriately large uncertainties in the presence of\nnon-overlap. In this approach, the tasks of estimating causal effects in the\noverlap and non-overlap regions are delegated to two distinct models, suited to\nthe degree of data support in each region. Tree ensembles are used to\nnon-parametrically estimate individual causal effects in the overlap region,\nwhere the data can speak for themselves. In the non-overlap region, where\ninsufficient data support means reliance on model specification is necessary,\nindividual causal effects are estimated by extrapolating trends from the\noverlap region via a spline model.

This is an analog of a result of Kn\\\"{o}rrer and\nBuchweitz-Greuel-Schreyer for rings of finite mCM type. Consequently, it is\nproved that $R$ has strongly unbounded lattice type whenever $k$ is infinite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 15:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

Motivated by\nthe positive impact of Delayed Acceleration Feedback (DAF) in various\nscenarios, in this paper, we incorporate DAF into the Classical Car-Following\nModel (CCFM). We begin by deriving the Classical Car-Following Model with\nDelayed Acceleration Feedback (CCFM-DAF). We then derive the necessary and\nsufficient condition for local stability of the CCFM-DAF. Next, we show that\nthe CCFM-DAF transits from the locally stable to the unstable regime via a Hopf\nbifurcation; thus leading to the emergence of limit cycles in system dynamics.\nWe then propose a suitable linear transformation that enables us to analyze the\nlocal bifurcation properties of the CCFM-DAF by studying the analogous\nproperties of the CCFM. We also study the impact of DAF on three important\ndynamical properties of the CCFM; namely, non-oscillatory convergence, string\nstability and robust stability. Our analyses are complemented with a stability\nchart and a bifurcation diagram. Our work reveals the following detrimental\neffects of DAF on the CCFM: (i) reduction in the locally stable region, (ii)\nincrease in the frequency of the emergent limit cycles, (iii) decrease in the\namplitude of the emergent limit cycles, (iv) destruction of the non-oscillatory\nproperty, (vi) increased risk of string instability, and (vii) reduced\nresilience towards parametric uncertainty. Thus, we report a\npractically-relevant application wherein DAF degrades the performance in\nseveral metrics of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 15:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

In other words, we characterize the class of linear\nread-once functions by means of minimal forbidden subfunctions within the\nuniverse of read-once and the universe of threshold functions. Within the\nuniverse of threshold functions the importance of linear read-once func- tions\nis due to the fact that they attain the minimum value of the specification\nnumber, which is n + 1 for functions depending on n variables. In 1995 Anthony\net al. conjec- tured that for all other threshold functions the specification\nnumber is strictly greater than n + 1. We disprove this conjecture by\nexhibiting a threshold non-linear read-once function depending on n variables\nwhose specification number is n + 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 08:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

As a consequence of these mutual\ninterferences of wireless systems might decrease the state of coexistence.\nTherefore, a central coexistence management system is needed, which allocates\nconflict-free resources to wireless systems. To ensure a conflict-free resource\nutilization, it is useful to predict the prospective medium utilization before\nresources are allocated. This paper presents a self-learning concept, which is\nbased on reinforcement learning. A simulative evaluation of reinforcement\nlearning agents based on neural networks, called deep Q-networks and double\ndeep Q-networks, was realized for exemplary and practically relevant\ncoexistence scenarios. The evaluation of the double deep Q-network showed that\na prediction accuracy of at least 98 % can be reached in all investigated\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 12:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

In\ncontrast, the \"search\" problem of this paper aims to only find the nodes in a\n\"single\" such community, the target, out of the many communities that may\nexist. To do so , we are given suitable side information about the target; for\nexample, a very small number of nodes from the target are labeled as such.\n  We consider a general yet simple notion of side information: all nodes are\nassumed to have random weights, with nodes in the target having higher weights\non average. Given these weights and the graph, we develop a variant of the\nmethod of moments that identifies nodes in the target more reliably, and with\nlower computation, than generic community detection methods that do not use\nside information and partition the entire graph. Our empirical results show\nsignificant gains in runtime, and also gains in accuracy over other graph\nclustering algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 04:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}
