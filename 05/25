We\nreview some of the previous works which are based on the well known dynamo\nmodel in which the star is born with a period of a few milliseconds at high\ntemperatures. In such a convection regime the dynamo mechanism can amplify the\nthe magnetic fields to the magnetar value. This is in contrast to a screened\ncore model which posits that a high density phase transition occurs in the\ninner core of magnetars that dynamically aligns all the neutron magnetic\nmoments producing a large magnetic field in the core. The accompanying change\nof flux gives rise to shielding or screening currents in the surrounding high\nconductivity plasma that do not permit the field to exit to the surface.\nAmbipolar diffusion then transports the field to the crust dissipating energy\nin neutrinos and X-rays. The up-welling field cleaves the crust resulting in\nflares and X-ray radiation from ohmic dissipation in the crust till the\nscreening currents are spent and the surface polar field attains its final\nvalue. In the dynamo model the polar magnetic field decreases with time whereas\nin our screened model it increases to its final value.

We\ntake ~5 million stars in the Galactic disk from the Gaia DR2 catalogue and\nbuild the velocity distribution of many different Galactic Neighbourhoods\ndistributed along 5 kpc in Galactic radius and azimuth.

The decrease rate is, on\naverage, of ~23 km/s/kpc. In azimuth, the kinematic sub-structures present much\nsmaller variations. We also observe a duality in their behaviour: some conserve\ntheir vertical angular momentum with radius (e.g., Hercules), while some seem\nto have nearly constant kinetic energy (e.g., Sirius). These two trends are\nconsistent with the approximate predictions of resonances and of phase mixing,\nrespectively.

To that end, we introduce\nCompetitive Collaboration, a framework that facilitates the coordinated\ntraining of multiple specialized neural networks to solve complex problems.\nCompetitive Collaboration works much like expectation-maximization, but with\nneural networks that act as both competitors to explain pixels that correspond\nto static or moving regions, and as collaborators through a moderator that\nassigns pixels to be either static or independently moving. Our novel method\nintegrates all these problems in a common framework and simultaneously reasons\nabout the segmentation of the scene into moving objects and the static\nbackground, the camera motion, depth of the static scene structure, and the\noptical flow of moving objects. Our model is trained without any supervision\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance among joint unsupervised methods on\nall sub-problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 17:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 21:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 19:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

The most distinctive signature of this\nstate in the charge transport sector is a resistance that varies linearly in\ntemperature, but this phenomenon does not clearly point to one mechanism as\ntemperature is a scalar quantity that influences every possible mechanism for\nmomentum relaxation. In a previous work we identified an unusual scaling\nrelationship between magnetic field and temperature in the in-plane resistivity\nof the unconventional superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_2$, providing\nan opportunity to use the vector nature of the magnetic field to acquire\nadditional clues about the mechanisms responsible for scattering in the strange\nmetal state. Here we extend this work by investigating other components of the\nconductivity tensor under different orientations of the magnetic field. We find\nthat the scaling phenomenon involves only the out-of-plane component of the\nmagnetic field and is, strikingly, independent of the direction of the applied\ncurrent. This suggests that the origin of the strange magnetotransport is in\nthe action of the magnetic field on the correlated behavior of spin and charge\ndegrees of freedom, rather than on the simple cyclotron motion of individual\nquasiparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 17:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The antiferromagnetic semimetals (AFS) are\nnewly discovered materials that possess massless Dirac fermions that are\nprotected by the crystalline symmetries. In this material, a reorientation of\nthe AF order may break the underlying symmetries and induce a finite energy\ngap. As such, the possible phase transition from the semimetallic to insulating\nphase gives us a choice for a wide range of resistance ensuring a large AMR. To\nfurther understand the robustness of the phase transition, we study thermal\nfluctuations of the AF order in AFS at a finite temperature. For macroscopic\nsamples, we find that the thermal fluctuations effectively decrease the\nmagnitude of the AF order by renormalizing the effective Hamiltonian. Our\nfinding suggests that the insulating phase exhibits a gap narrowing at elevated\ntemperatures, which leads to a substantial decrease in AMR. We also examine\nspatially correlated thermal fluctuations for microscopic samples by solving\nthe microscopic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation finding a qualitative\ndifference of the gap narrowing in the insulating phase. For both cases, the\nsemimetallic phase shows a minimal change in its transmission spectrum\nillustrating the robustness of the symmetry protected states in AFS. Our\nfinding may serve as a guideline for estimating and maximizing AMR of the AFS\nsamples at elevated temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

In the\nidealized setting of a magnetized beta plane, we provide a theoretical\nexplanation that shows how magnetic fluctuations directly counteract the growth\nof weak zonal flows. Two distinct calculations yield consistent conclusions.\nThe first, which is simpler and more physically transparent, extends the\nKelvin-Orr shearing wave to include magnetic fields and shows that weak,\nlong-wavelength shear flow organizes magnetic fluctuations to absorb energy\nfrom the mean flow.

Here we develop\na Wannier-function-based tight-binding (WF-TB) model to investigate the\nformation of Weyl nodes and nodal rings induced by B field in the topological\nDSM Na$_3$Bi. The field is applied along the rotational axis. Remarkably, our\nstudy based on the WF-TB model shows that upon B field each Dirac node is split\ninto four separate Weyl nodes along the rotational axis near the Fermi level;\ntwo nodes with single chiral charge (single Weyl nodes) and two with double\nchiral charge (double Weyl nodes). This result is in contrast to the common\nbelief that each Dirac node splits into two Weyl nodes. In the effective\nmodels, the existence of double Weyl nodes ensures nonzero cubic terms in\nmomentum. We further examine the evolution of Fermi arcs at a side surface as a\nfunction of chemical potential.

While often this is a\nreasonable measure, in some occasions it does not express sufficiently well the\nactual performance of the algorithm. For example, an execution in which one\nprocessor performs r rounds, and all the rest perform significantly less rounds\nthan r, has the same running time as an execution in which all processors\nperform the same number of rounds r. On the other hand, the latter execution is\nless efficient in several respects, such as energy efficiency, task execution\nefficiency, local-neighborhood efficiency and simulation efficiency.\nConsequently, a more appropriate measure is required in these cases.

Here we describe a generic method to model an agent's behavior\nunder an environment with uncertainty, and infer the agent's internal model,\nreward function, and dynamic beliefs. We apply our method to a simulated agent\nperforming a naturalistic foraging task. We assume the agent behaves rationally\n--- that is, they take actions that optimize their subjective utility according\nto their understanding of the task and its relevant causal variables. We model\nthis rational solution as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process\n(POMDP) where the agent may make wrong assumptions about the task parameters.\nGiven the agent's sensory observations and actions, we learn its internal model\nand reward function by maximum likelihood estimation over a set of\ntask-relevant parameters. The Markov property of the POMDP enables us to\ncharacterize the transition probabilities between internal belief states and\niteratively estimate the agent's policy using a constrained\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

We argue that one possible source driving the escape of\nionizing radiation is stellar winds and radiation from hot massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 19:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

In the last decade, numerous statistical methodologies have been\ndeveloped for efficiently recovering the unknown low-rank matrices. However, in\nsome applications, the unknown singular subspace is scientifically more\nimportant than the low-rank matrix itself. In this article, we revisit the\nlow-rank matrix regression model and introduce a two-step procedure to\nconstruct confidence regions of the singular subspace. The procedure involves\nthe de-biasing for the typical low-rank estimators after which we calculate the\nempirical singular vectors. We investigate the distribution of the joint\nprojection distance between the empirical singular subspace and the unknown\ntrue singular subspace. We specifically prove the asymptotical normality of the\njoint projection distance with data-dependent centering and normalization when\n$r^{3/2}(m_1+m_2)^{3/2}=o(n/\\log n)$ where $m_1, m_2$ denote the matrix row and\ncolumn sizes, $r$ is the rank and $n$ is the number of independent random\nmeasurements. Consequently, we propose data-dependent confidence regions of the\ntrue singular subspace which attains any pre-determined confidence level\nasymptotically. In addition, non-asymptotical convergence rates are also\nestablished.

Using BESS and\nPAMELA measurements which agree with each other, the observed spectra for H and\nHe nuclei and the H/He ratio are well fit by source rigidity spectra for both\nnuclei which are ~P-2.24 over the entire range of rigidities corresponding to\nenergies between 10 MeV/nuc and several hundred GeV/nuc.

In particular the H spectrum is\nfound to be steeper than that of He by about 0.10 in the spectral exponent.\nUsing the same model for galactic propagation the AMS-2 data leads to source\nspectra of H and He which are ~P-2.24 up to a break rigidity ~6-8 GV. At higher\nrigidities the He source spectrum continues to be ~P-2.24 but the required\nsource spectrum for H steepens to an index ~P-2.36 above ~8 GV and, as a\nresult, the H/He source ratio decreases with increasing rigidity using the\nAMS-2 data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 20:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

It could be produced by unknown systematics or\nby physics beyond the standard model. On the other hand, it is well known that\nlinear perturbation theory predicts a cosmic variance on the Hubble parameter\n$H_0$, which leads to systematic errors on its local determination. Here, we\nstudy how including in the likelihood the cosmic variance on $H_0$ affects\nstatistical inference. In particular we consider the $\\gamma$CDM, $w$CDM and\n$\\gamma w$CDM parametric extensions of the standard model, which we constrain\nwith the latest CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, RSD and $H_0$ data. We learn two important\nlessons. First, the systematic error from cosmic variance is - independently of\nthe model - approximately $\\sigma_{\\text{cv}}\\approx 0.88$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$ (1.2\\% $H_0^{\\text{loc}}$) when considering the redshift range\n$0.0233 \\le z \\le 0.15$, which is relative to the main analysis of\n(arXiv:1804.10655), and $\\sigma_{\\text{cv}}\\approx 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$\n(2.1\\% $H_0^{\\text{loc}}$) when considering the wider redshift range $0.01 \\le\nz \\le 0.15$.

The WL effect depends on the lensing potential (LP) caused by matter\nperturbations, the distribution of which at cosmological scales is given by the\nmatter power spectrum (MPS). Therefore, the WL effect on the CMB $B$ mode is\naffected by the MPS. Considering the effect of the ensemble average energy\ndensity of the PMF, which we call \"the background PMF,\" on the MPS, the\namplitude of MPS is suppressed in the wave number range of $k>0.01~h$\nMpc$^{-1}$.The MPS affects the LP and the WL effect in the CMB $B$ mode;\nhowever, the PMF can damp this effect. Previous studies of the CMB $B$ mode\nwith the PMF have only considered the vector and tensor modes. These modes\nboost the CMB $B$ mode in the multipole range of $\\ell > 1000$, whereas the\nbackground PMF damps the CMB $B$ mode owing to the WL effect in the entire\nmultipole range. The matter density in the Universe controls the WL effect.\nTherefore, when we constrain the PMF and the matter density parameters from\ncosmological observational data sets, including the CMB $B$ mode, we expect\ndegeneracy between these parameters. The CMB $B$ mode also provides important\ninformation on the background gravitational waves, inflation theory, matter\ndensity fluctuations, and the structure formations at the cosmological scale\nthrough the cosmological parameter search.

To achieve a quantitative understanding of the\nbest-case scenario limits for reliable period detection imposed by these\ninconveniences, we embarked on a comprehensive set of injection tests,\ninjecting 120,000 sinusoidal signals with periods ranging from 5 to 35d and\namplitudes from 0.05% to 3.0% into real Campaign 5 M67 light curves processed\nusing two different pipelines. We attempted to recover the signals using a\nnormalized version of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and setting a detection\nthreshold. We find that while the reliability of detected periods is high, the\ncompleteness (sensitivity) drops rapidly with increasing period and decreasing\namplitude, maxing at 15% recovery rate for the solar case (i.e. 25d period,\n0.1% amplitude). This study highlights the need for caution in determining M67\nrotation periods from Campaign 5 data, but this can be extended to other\nclusters observed by K2 and, soon, TESS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 22:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 22:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

The computation is carried out on a\ndistributed system consisting of a master node and multiple worker nodes. Such\ndistributed systems are significantly slowed down due to the presence of\nslow-running machines (stragglers) as well as various communication\nbottlenecks. We propose \"polynomially coded regression\" (PCR) that\nsubstantially reduces the effect of stragglers and lessens the communication\nburden in such systems. The key idea of PCR is to encode the partial data\nstored at each worker, such that the computations at the workers can be viewed\nas evaluating a polynomial at distinct points. This allows the master to\ncompute the final gradient by interpolating this polynomial. PCR significantly\nreduces the recovery threshold, defined as the number of workers the master has\nto wait for prior to computing the gradient. In particular, PCR requires a\nrecovery threshold that scales inversely proportionally with the amount of\ncomputation/storage available at each worker. In comparison, state-of-the-art\nstraggler-mitigation schemes require a much higher recovery threshold that only\ndecreases linearly in the per worker computation/storage load. We prove that\nPCR's recovery threshold is near minimal and within a factor two of the best\npossible scheme. Our experiments over Amazon EC2 demonstrate that compared with\nstate-of-the-art schemes, PCR improves the run-time by 1.50x ~ 2.36x with\nnaturally occurring stragglers, and by as much as 2.58x ~ 4.29x with artificial\nstragglers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 23:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

However, this task can be challenging to\naccomplish because of unsatisfactory angiography image quality and complex\nvascular structures. Thus, this study proposed a new greedy graph search-based\nmethod for vascular tracking. Each vascular branch is separated from the\nvasculature and is tracked independently. Then, all branches are combined using\ntopology optimization, thereby resulting in complete vasculature tracking. A\ngray-based image registration method was applied to determine the tracking\nrange, and the deformation field between two consecutive frames was calculated.\nThe vascular branch was described using a vascular centerline extraction method\nwith multi-probability fusion-based topology optimization. We introduce an\nundirected acyclic graph establishment technique. A greedy search method was\nproposed to acquire all possible paths in the graph that might match the\ntracked vascular branch. The final tracking result was selected by branch\nmatching using dynamic time warping with a DAISY descriptor. The solution to\nthe problem reflected both the spatial and textural information between\nsuccessive frames. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method\nwas effective and robust for vascular tracking, attaining a F1 score of 0.89 on\na single branch dataset and 0.88 on a vessel tree dataset.

The\nneural network controllers we consider are feedforward neural networks called\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLP) with general activation functions.

By\ndiscretizing the input set of the MLP into a finite number of hyper-rectangular\ncells, our approach develops a linear programming (LP) based algorithm for\nover-approximating the output set of the MLP with its input set as a union of\nhyper-rectangular cells. Combining the over-approximation for the output set of\nan MLP based controller and reachable set computation routines for ordinary\ndifference/differential equation (ODE) models, an algorithm is developed to\nestimate the reachable set of the closed-loop system. Finally, safety\nverification for neural network control systems can be performed by checking\nthe existence of intersections between the estimated reachable set and unsafe\nregions.

In a follow-up work, the authors further show that NDP-Grid is\nhard to approximate to within factor $\\Omega(2^{\\log^{1-\\epsilon}n})$ for any\nconstant $\\epsilon$ under standard complexity assumptions, and to within factor\n$n^{\\Omega(1/(\\log\\log n)^2)}$ under randomized ETH.\n  In this paper we study NDP-Grid, where all source vertices {s_1,...,s_k}\nappear on the grid boundary. Our main result is an efficient randomized\n$2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n} \\cdot \\log\\log n)}$-approximation algorithm for this\nproblem. We generalize this result to instances where the source vertices lie\nwithin a prescribed distance from the grid boundary.\n  Much of the work on approximation algorithms for NDP relies on the\nmulticommodity flow relaxation of the problem, which is known to have an\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt n)$ integrality gap, even in grid graphs. Our work departs from\nthis paradigm, and uses a (completely different) linear program only to select\nthe pairs to be routed, while the routing itself is computed by other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 03:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

That is, when performing the\nnew domain embedding, the system has seen many past domains, and it tries to\nexpand the new in-domain corpus by exploiting the corpora from the past domains\nvia meta-learning. The proposed meta-learner characterizes the similarities of\nthe contexts of the same word in many domain corpora, which helps retrieve\nrelevant data from the past domains to expand the new domain corpus.\nExperimental results show that domain embeddings produced from such a process\nimprove the performance of the downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 06:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

Our results represent a crucial step towards the understanding of the\nproperties of interlayer excitons, with strong implications for the\nimplementation of atomically thin valleytronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 07:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

First, analytic solutions are rarely available so\nrepeated evaluation of these models by numerically solving differential\nequations incurs a significant computational burden. Second, many models\nundergo bifurcations in behaviour as parameters are varied. As a result,\nsimulation outputs often contain discontinuities as we change parameter values\nand move through parameter/input space.\n  Statistical emulators such as Gaussian processes are frequently used to\nreduce the computational cost of uncertainty quantification, but\ndiscontinuities render a standard Gaussian process emulation approach\nunsuitable as these emulators assume a smooth and continuous response to\nchanges in parameter values.\n  In this article, we propose a novel two-step method for building a Gaussian\nProcess emulator for models with discontinuous response surfaces.

For $PT$-symmetric\nbosonic systems, the no-signaling principle and the quantum brachistochrone\nproblem have been studied to some degree, both of them controversially. In this\npaper, we apply the basic methods proposed for bosonic systems to {\\it\nfermionic} two- and four-dimensional $PT$-symmetric Hamiltonians, and obtain\nseveral surprising results: We find - in contrast to the bosonic case - that\nthe no-signaling principle is upheld for two-dimensional fermionic\nHamiltonians, however, the $PT$ symmetry is broken. In addition, we find that\nthe time required for the evolution from a given initial state, the spin-up, to\na given final state, the spin-down, is a constant, independent of the\nparameters of the Hamiltonian, under the eigenvalue constraint. That is, it\ncannot - as in the bosonic case - be optimized. We do, however, also find a\ndimensional dependence: four-dimensional $PT$-symmetric fermionic Hamiltonians\nconsidered here again uphold the no-signaling principle, but it is not\nessential that the $PT$ symmetry be broken. The symmetry is, however, broken if\nthe measure of entanglement is conserved. In the four-dimensional systems, the\nevolution time between orthogonal states is dependent on the parameters of the\nHamiltonian, with the conclusion that it again can be optimized, and approach\nzero under certain circumstances. However, if we require the conservation of\nentanglement, the transformation time between these two states becomes the same\nconstant as found in the two-dimensional case, which coincides with the minimum\ntime for such a transformation to take place in the Hermitian case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 09:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 08:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

In order to\nprovide safe yet not too conservative driving in complex urban environment,\ndata fusion should not only consider redundant sensing to characterize the\nsurrounding obstacles, but also be able to describe the uncertainties and\nerrors beyond presence/absence (be it binary or probabilistic). This paper\nintroduces an enriched representation of the world, more precisely of the\npotential existence of obstacles through an evidential grid map. A method to\ncreate this representation from 2 very different sensors, laser scanner and\nstereo camera, is presented along with algorithms for data fusion and temporal\nupdates. This work allows a better handling of the dynamic aspects of the urban\nenvironment and a proper management of errors in order to create a more\nreliable map. We use the evidential framework based on the Dempster-Shafer\ntheory to model the environment perception by the sensors. A new combination\noperator is proposed to merge the different sensor grids considering their\ndistinct uncertainties. In addition, we introduce a new long-life layer with\nhigh level states that allows the maintenance of a global map of the entire\nvehicle's trajectory and distinguish between static and dynamic obstacles.\nResults on a real road dataset show that the environment mapping data can be\nimproved by adding relevant information that could be missed without the\nproposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 15:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

Bayesian estimation methods for network models offer a number of\nadvantages in this context but are not commonly employed.

In particular when the network size is in the order of that used\nfor whole-brain studies (about 100 nodes) the Bayesian method needs about eight\ntimes more time samples than Lyapunov method in order to achieve similar\nestimation accuracy. We also show that the higher estimation accuracy of\nLyapunov method is reflected in a much better classification of individuals\nbased on the estimated connectivity from a real dataset of BOLD fMRI. Finally\nwe show that the poor accuracy of Bayesian method is due to numerical errors,\nwhen the imaginary part of the connectivity estimate gets large compared to its\nreal part.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 09:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

We then discuss\nthe resonance tracking task in two parts: recursively identifying the frequency\ndisturbance and incorporating an update of the excitation frequency in the\nalgorithm. The complex representation of the system simplifies the design of\nresonance tracking algorithms due to the applicability of well-established\ntechniques. We discuss the stability of the proposed scheme, even in cases that\nseriously challenge current phase-based approaches, such as nonmonotonic phase\ndifferences and multiple-input multiple-output systems. Numerical simulations\nfurther demonstrate the performance of the proposed resonance tracking scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 11:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 20:46:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 16:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

The\nX-ray pulsar and radio pulsar states correspond to accretion with spin-down\n(weak propeller) and strong propeller situations respectively. Several times\nincrease in the disk mass-flow rate takes the source from the strong propeller\nwith a low Lx to the weak propeller with a higher Lx powered by accretion on to\nthe star. The resultant decrease in r_in increases the magnetic torque\nslightly, explaining the observed small increase in the spin-down rate.

To revoke and\nreissue a new template in place of the compromised biometric template, the idea\nof cancelable biometrics has been introduced. The concept behind cancelable\nbiometric is to irreversibly transform the original biometric template and\nperform the comparison in the protected domain. In this paper, a coprime\ntransformation scheme has been proposed to derive a protected fingerprint\ntemplate. The method divides the fingerprint region into a number of sectors\nwith respect to each minutiae point and identifies the nearest-neighbor\nminutiae in each sector. Then, ridge features for all neighboring minutiae\npoints are computed and mapped onto co-prime positions of a random matrix to\ngenerate the cancelable template.

An agent forms an attitude about another agent depending\non the similarity between their cultural identities. When a terrorist attack is\nperpetrated in the name of an extreme cultural identity, the negatively\nperceived agents from this extreme cultural identity modify their margins of\nacceptance in order to differentiate themselves more from the threatening\ncultural identity.

We present HST photometry and VLT\nspectroscopy in order to improve observational constraints, finding the\nQuintuplet to be far more homogeneous than previously thought. O7-8 Ia and\nO9-B0 Ia supergiants form a smooth morphological sequence with a cohort of\nseven early-B hypergiants and six luminous blue variables and WN9-11h stars,\nwhich together comprise the richest population of such stars of any known\nstellar aggregate. No further H-free Wolf-Rayets were found, resulting in a\n13:1 ratio for WC/WN stars. However a small population of late-O hypergiants\nand WN8-9ha stars was identified, while a subset of the supergiants are\nunexpectedly faint, suggesting they are both less massive and older than the\ngreater cluster population. We find an impressive coincidence between cluster\nmembers preceding the H-free WR phase and the evolutionary predictions for a\n60Msun star, suggesting an age of ~3.0-3.6Myr for the Quintuplet. Neither the\nlate-O hypergiants nor the low luminosity supergiants are predicted; we suggest\nthat the former either result from rapid rotators or are the products of binary\ndriven mass-stripping, while the latter may be interlopers. The H-free WRs must\nhave had initial masses >60Msun, but it is difficult to reconcile their\nobservational properties with theoretical expectations. Since the WRs represent\nan evolutionary phase directly preceding core-collapse, they are are crucial to\nunderstanding both this process and the nature of the resultant relativistic\nremnants, providing unique constraints on the evolution and death of the most\nmassive stars forming in the local, high metallicity Universe (Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 13:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

The elucidation of a\ncomprehensive structure-permeability relationship expressed in terms of a few\nmolecular descriptors is unfortunately hampered by the overwhelming number of\npossible compounds. In this work, we reduce a priori the size and diversity of\nchemical space to solve an analogous---but smoothed out---structure-property\nrelationship problem. This is achieved by relying on a physics-based\ncoarse-grained model that reduces the size of chemical space, enabling a\ncomprehensive exploration of this space with greatly reduced computational\ncost. We perform high-throughput coarse-grained (HTCG) simulations to derive a\npermeability surface in terms of two simple molecular descriptors---bulk\npartitioning free energy and pKa. The surface is constructed by exhaustively\nsimulating all coarse-grained compounds that are representative of small\norganic molecules (ranging from 30 to 160 Da) in a high-throughput scheme. We\nprovide results for acidic, basic and zwitterionic compounds. Connecting back\nto the atomic resolution, the HTCG predictions for more than 500,000 compounds\nallow us to establish a clear connection between specific chemical groups and\nthe resulting permeability coefficient, enabling for the first time an inverse\ndesign procedure.

In this paper, we show that the\nredshift-space line correlation function--which is a measure of Fourier phase\ncorrelations--is sensitive to the nonlinear growth of the density and velocity\nfields and to the nonlinear mapping between real and redshift space. We expand\nthe line correlation function in multipoles, and we show that almost all of the\ninformation is encoded in the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole. We argue\nthat these multipoles are highly complementary to the multipoles of the\ntwo-point correlation function: first, because they are directly sensitive to\nthe difference between the density and the velocity coupling kernels, which is\na purely nonlinear quantity; and second, because the multipoles are\nproportional to different combinations of $f$ and $\\sigma_8$.

We define the reference set to be\nvacuum oscillations in the limit of maximal $\\theta_{23}$ and no CP-violation.\nWe then calculate the deviations induced in the $\\nu_e$ appearance signal event\nrate by three unknown effects: (a) matter effects, due to normal or inverted\nhierarchy (b) octant effects, due to $\\theta_{23}$ being in higher or lower\noctant and (c) CP-violation, whether $\\delta_{CP} \\sim - \\pi/2$ or $\\delta_{CP}\n\\sim \\pi/2$.

Systematic shifts due to\nretroreflection quality, the Zeeman effect, and the ac Stark effect have been\nconsidered during the analysis of the measured spectra; particularly in the\ncase of the OD isotopologue, these effects can result in shifts of the fitted\nline positions of as much as 300 kHz. The transition frequencies extracted in\nthe analysis were also used to determine spectroscopic constants for the $A\\,\n^2\\Sigma^+,v'=0$ vibronic state. The constants fitted in this work differ\nsignificantly from those reported in previous works that measured the $A - X$\ntransitions, resulting in typical deviations of the predicted optical\ntransition frequencies of $\\sim$150 MHz, but they generally agree quite well\nwith the constants determined using hyperfine-resolved measurements of\nsplittings within the $A$ state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 15:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 17:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Nevertheless, even for these constrained\npercepts, psychophysics have not yet reached the challenging prediction stage,\nwhere human detection would be quantitatively predicted by a (generic) model.\nOn the other hand, Computer Vision has attempted at defining automatic\ndetection thresholds. This chapter sketches a procedure to confront these two\nmethodologies inspired in gestaltism. Using a computational quantitative\nversion of the non-accidentalness principle, we raise the possibility that the\npsychophysical and the (older) gestaltist setups, both applicable on dot or\nGabor patterns, find a useful complement in a Turing test. In our perceptual\nTuring test, human performance is compared by the scientist to the detection\nresult given by a computer. This confrontation permits to revive the abandoned\nmethod of gestaltic games. We sketch the elaboration of such a game, where the\nsubjects of the experiment are confronted to an alignment detection algorithm,\nand are invited to draw examples that will fool it. We show that in that way a\nmore precise definition of the alignment gestalt and of its computational\nformulation seems to emerge. Detection algorithms might also be relevant to\nmore classic psychophysical setups, where they can again play the role of a\nTuring test. To a visual experiment where subjects were invited to detect\nalignments in Gabor patterns, we associated a single function measuring the\nalignment detectability in the form of a number of false alarms (NFA). The\nfirst results indicate that the values of the NFA, as a function of all\nsimulation parameters, are highly correlated to the human detection. This fact,\nthat we intend to support by further experiments , might end up confirming that\nhuman alignment detection is the result of a single mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 15:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

Despite\nsome previous work, to our knowledge, there does not exist a satisfactory\nsolution to this important problem. In this paper, we carefully detail the\nproblem and develop a novel approach to address it. Our idea is to impute the\nhourly temperatures at the location of the measurements by borrowing\ninformation from the nearby stations that record hourly temperatures, which\nthen can be used to create accurate summaries of temperature extremes. The key\ndifficulty is that these imputations of the temperature curves must satisfy the\nconstraint of falling between the observed daily minima and maxima, and\nattaining those values at least once in a twenty-four hour period. We develop a\nspatiotemporal Gaussian process model for imputing the hourly measurements from\nthe nearby stations, and then develop a novel and easy to implement Markov\nChain Monte Carlo technique to sample from the posterior distribution\nsatisfying the above constraints. We validate our imputation model using hourly\ntemperature data from four meteorological stations in Iowa, of which one is\nhidden and the data replaced with daily minima and maxima, and show that the\nimputed temperatures recover the hidden temperatures well. We also demonstrate\nthat our model can exploit information contained in the data to infer the time\nof daily measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 15:52:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 16:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

The\njustification of the fact that information is physical, is done by\ninter-linking information and thermodynamics - through Landauer's principle.\nThis modern approach towards information recently has improved our\nunderstanding of thermodynamics, both in classical and quantum domains. Here we\nshow thermodynamics as a consequence of information conservation. Our approach\ncan be applied to most general situations, where systems and thermal-baths\ncould be quantum, of arbitrary sizes and even could posses inter-system\ncorrelations. The approach does not rely on an a priori predetermined\ntemperature associated to a thermal bath, which is not meaningful for\nfinite-size cases. Hence, the thermal-baths and systems are not different,\nrather both are treated on an equal footing. This results in a\n\"temperature\"-independent formulation of thermodynamics. We exploit the fact\nthat, for a fix amount of coarse-grained information, measured by the von\nNeumann entropy, any system can be transformed to a state that possesses\nminimal energy, without changing its entropy. This state is known as a\ncompletely passive state, which assumes Boltzmann-Gibb's canonical form with an\nintrinsic temperature. This leads us to introduce the notions of bound and free\nenergy, which we further use to quantify heat and work respectively. With this\nguiding principle of information conservation, we develop universal notions of\nequilibrium, heat and work, Landauer's principle and also universal fundamental\nlaws of thermodynamics. We show that the maximum efficiency of a quantum\nengine, equipped with a finite baths, is in general lower than that of an ideal\nCarnot's engine. We also introduce a resource theoretic framework for\nintrinsic-temperature based thermodynamics, within which we address the problem\nof work extraction and state transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 09:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

Systems designed for visual\ninstance search face the major challenge of scalability: a collection of a few\nmillion images used for instance search typically creates a few billion\nfeatures that must be indexed. Furthermore, as real image collections grow\nrapidly, systems must also provide dynamicity, i.e., be able to handle on-line\ninsertions while concurrently serving retrieval operations.

The dark fluid described by our parameterization behaves for\nbig redshifts like a dark matter. Therefore one can parameterize dark energy\nand dark matter using a single dark fluid, like in the case of the Chaplygin\ngas. Within this parameterization we consider 2 models: one with DE barotropic\nparameter fixed to be $-1$ and the second one, where $w \\neq -1$ is chosen to\nmatch the best fit to the data. We study main cosmological properties of these\nmodels at the expansion and perturbation levels.

Furthermore, each agent is faced with an optimization\nproblem in order to determine the optimal asset allocation. The stock price\nevolution is driven by the aggregated investment decision of all agents. In\nfact, we are faced with a differential game since all agents aim to invest\noptimal. Mathematically such a problem is ill posed and we introduce the\nconcept of Nash equilibrium solutions to ensure the existence of a solution.\nEspecially, we denote an agent who solves this Nash equilibrium exactly a\nrational agent. As next step we use model predictive control to approximate the\ncontrol problem. This enables us to derive a precise mathematical\ncharacterization of the degree of rationality of a financial agent. This is a\nnovel concept in portfolio optimization and can be regarded as a general\napproach. In a second step we consider the case of a fully myopic agent, where\nwe can solve the optimal investment decision of investors analytically. We\nselect the running cost to be the expected missed revenue of an agent and we\nassume quadratic transaction costs.

Although a\nnumber of methods have been proposed to accelerate spectral clustering, most of\nthem compromise considerable information loss in the original data for reducing\ncomputational bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a novel scalable spectral\nclustering method using Random Binning features (RB) to simultaneously\naccelerate both similarity graph construction and the eigendecomposition.\nSpecifically, we implicitly approximate the graph similarity (kernel) matrix by\nthe inner product of a large sparse feature matrix generated by RB.

Using these two building blocks, we\nreduce the computational cost from quadratic to linear in the number of data\npoints while achieving similar accuracy.

I also show that particle production\ndoes not take place out of vacuum state but it can happen out of other\nmany-particle states and vacuum state is not an eigenvector of Hamltonian\noperator in transformed Fock space and vacuum state does not remain vacuum\nstate under time evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 09:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

Therefore in this paper, we have revisited the\npopular CG schemes and found out some scope of improvisation to support the\nsimultaneous reduction of static and dynamic power dissipation.

The CDN VAS VNF-FGs have a specific characteristic: they have\none end-point (corresponding to the content server) that is unknown, prior to\ntheir placement. The proposals for CDN VAS VNF-FG placement, so far, have only\nconsidered offline placement, where the VNF-FGs are placed before end-user\ntraffic steers into the network. However, in concrete cases, a change in\nservice usage patterns might occur, a situation that could require a VNF-FG\nplacement in an online manner.

A number of recent\npublications have quantified the bifacial gain for several configurations. For\nexample, a standalone, optimally-tilted bifacial panel placed over a flat\nground (with 50% albedo) is expected to produce a bifacial energy gain of 30%\n(per module area). In contrast, for a panel array in a solar farm, self and\nmutual shading reduce the bifacial gain at the same tilt to 10-15% (per farm\narea). Bifacial gain is negligible for vertical arrays--although the\nconfiguration is of significant interest, since it can prevent soiling. Here,\nwe calculate the bifacial gain of a solar farm where vertical arrays have been\nplaced over sculpted/patterned ground. We conclude that vertical panels\nstraddling (upward) triangle-shaped ground maximizes the energy output. For\nthis optimum configuration, the bifacial gain can approach 50%, especially for\nregions with moderate to high cloudy conditions. The enhanced output, along\nwith reduced soiling loss and lower cleaning cost of the ground sculpted\nvertical bifacial (GvBF) solar farm could be of significant technological\ninterest, especially in regions such as the Middle East and North Africa\n(MENA), particularly susceptible to significant soiling losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 10:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}
