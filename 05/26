While these systems represent a significant milestone in the\nadvancement of quantum computing, existing and near-term quantum computers are\nnot yet large enough to fully support quantum error-correction. Such systems\nwith few tens to few hundreds of qubits are termed as Noisy Intermediate Scale\nQuantum computers (NISQ), and these systems can provide benefits for a class of\nquantum algorithms. In this paper, we study the problems of Qubit-Allocation\n(mapping of program qubits to machine qubits) and Qubit-Movement(routing qubits\nfrom one location to another to perform entanglement).\n  We observe that there exists variation in the error rates of different qubits\nand links, which can have an impact on the decisions for qubit movement and\nqubit allocation. We analyze characterization data for the IBM-Q20 quantum\ncomputer gathered over 52 days to understand and quantify the variation in the\nerror-rates and find that there is indeed significant variability in the error\nrates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We define reliability\nmetrics for NISQ computers and show that the device variability has the\nsubstantial impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the\nvariability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and\nVariation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and\nallocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links and guide more\noperations towards the stronger qubits and links. We show that our\nVariation-Aware policies improve the reliability of the NISQ system up to 2.5x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 16:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

The map of the\nenvironment, acquired with online state-of-the-art algorithms, often degrades\nafter a few steps, due to sensing inaccuracies, slippage and unexpected\ndisturbances. When designing locomotion algorithms, this degradation can result\nin planned trajectories that are not consistent with the reality, if not dealt\nproperly. In this work, we propose a heuristic-based planning approach that\nenables a quadruped robot to successfully traverse a significantly rough\nterrain (e.g., stones up to 10 cm of diameter), in absence of visual feedback.\nWhen available, the approach allows also to exploit the visual feedback (e.g.,\nto enhance the stepping strategy) in multiple ways, according to the quality of\nthe 3D map. The proposed framework also includes reflexes, triggered in\nspecific situations, and the possibility to estimate online an unknown\ntime-varying disturbance and compensate for it. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the approach with experiments performed on our quadruped robot\nHyQ (85 kg), traversing different terrains, such as: ramps, rocks, bricks,\npallets and stairs. We also demonstrate the capability to estimate and\ncompensate for disturbances, showing the robot walking up a ramp while pulling\na cart attached to its back.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 16:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 12:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 15:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 13:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

While there are\nalgorithms with provable guarantees for learning undirected graphical models in\na variety of settings, there has been much less progress in the important\nscenario when there are latent variables. Here we study Restricted Boltzmann\nMachines (or RBMs), which are a popular model with wide-ranging applications in\ndimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, topic modeling, feature\nextraction and deep learning.\n  The main message of our paper is a strong dichotomy in the feasibility of\nlearning RBMs, depending on the nature of the interactions between variables:\nferromagnetic models can be learned efficiently, while general models cannot.\nIn particular, we give a simple greedy algorithm based on influence\nmaximization to learn ferromagnetic RBMs with bounded degree. In fact, we learn\na description of the distribution on the observed variables as a Markov Random\nField. Our analysis is based on tools from mathematical physics that were\ndeveloped to show the concavity of magnetization. Our algorithm extends\nstraighforwardly to general ferromagnetic Ising models with latent variables.\n  Conversely, we show that even for a contant number of latent variables with\nconstant degree, without ferromagneticity the problem is as hard as sparse\nparity with noise. This hardness result is based on a sharp and surprising\ncharacterization of the representational power of bounded degree RBMs: the\ndistribution on their observed variables can simulate any bounded order MRF.\nThis result is of independent interest since RBMs are the building blocks of\ndeep belief networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 17:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 19:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

The evolution of the\nmerger rate across redshifts $0 < z \\lesssim 1$ is directly tied to the\nformation and evolutionary processes, providing insight regarding the\nprogenitor formation rate together with the distribution of time delays between\nformation and merger. Because the limiting distance to which BBHs are detected\ndepends on the masses of the binary, the redshift distribution of detected\nbinaries depends on their underlying mass distribution. We therefore consider\nthe mass and redshift distributions simultaneously, and fit the merger rate\ndensity, ${dN}/{dm_1\\,dm_2\\,dz}$. Our constraints on the mass distribution\nagree with previously published results, including evidence for an upper mass\ncutoff at $\\sim 40 \\ M_\\odot$.

A\nthird scenario proposes that a classically Lorentz invariant matter sector with\ncontrolled quantum corrections may simply co-exist with Horava gravity under\ncertain conditions. However, for non-projectable Horava gravity in 3+1\ndimensions it is known that, in the absence of additional structures, this\nmechanism is spoiled by unexpected power-law divergences. We confirm this same\nresult in the projectable version of the theory by employing the recently found\ngauge-fixing term that renders the shift and graviton propagators regular. We\nshow that the problem persists for all dimensions $D\\geq 3$, and that the\ndegree of fine tuning in squared sound speeds between a U(1) gauge field and a\nscalar field increases with $D$.

When rewards are only sparsely available during an episode, or a\nrewarding feedback is provided only after episode termination, these algorithms\nperform sub-optimally due to the difficultly in credit assignment.\nAlternatively, trajectory-based policy optimization methods, such as\ncross-entropy method and evolution strategies, do not require per-timestep\nrewards, but have been found to suffer from high sample complexity by\ncompleting forgoing the temporal nature of the problem. Improving the\nefficiency of RL algorithms in real-world problems with sparse or episodic\nrewards is therefore a pressing need. In this work, we introduce a\nself-imitation learning algorithm that exploits and explores well in the sparse\nand episodic reward settings. We view each policy as a state-action visitation\ndistribution and formulate policy optimization as a divergence minimization\nproblem. We show that with Jensen-Shannon divergence, this divergence\nminimization problem can be reduced into a policy-gradient algorithm with\nshaped rewards learned from experience replays. Experimental results indicate\nthat our algorithm works comparable to existing algorithms in environments with\ndense rewards, and significantly better in environments with sparse and\nepisodic rewards. We then discuss limitations of self-imitation learning, and\npropose to solve them by using Stein variational policy gradient descent with\nthe Jensen-Shannon kernel to learn multiple diverse policies.

The LK mechanism is only effective if the binary is\nhighly inclined with respect to its orbit around the MBH (within a few degrees\nof 90 deg), implying low rates.

Here, we\nstudy the coupled LK-VRR dynamics, with implications for LIGO and VIRGO GW\nsources.

We find that, even in our most optimistic scenario, the baseline BH-BH\nmerger rate is small, and the enhancement by LK-VRR coupling is not large\nenough to increase the rate to well above the LIGO/VIRGO lower limit, 12\nGpc^{-3} yr^{-1}. For the Galactic Center, the LK-VRR-enhanced rate is ~100\ntimes lower than the LIGO/VIRGO limit, and for M_MBH = 1e4 MSun, the rate\nbarely reaches 12 Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 18:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 15:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

We use a radiative\ntransfer model to study the spectroscopic fingerprint of these atmospheres in\ntransit observations. Spectral signatures of abiotic oxygen and ozone can be of\ncomparable magnitude as in spectra of Earth seen as an exoplanet. Middle\natmospheric water vapor is unlikely to be a usable indicator of the abiotic\norigin of oxygen because of the influence of oxygen on the water vapor\ndistribution. This suggests that atmospheric oxygen and ozone cannot be used as\nbinary bioindicators and their interpretation will likely require atmospheric\nand planetary models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 19:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

On the basis of the theory\nof invariant observer design by Barrau and Bonnabel, and in particular, the\nInvariant EKF (InEKF), we show that the error dynamics of the point\ncontact-inertial system follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation;\nhence, the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain\nof attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory.

Simulation results using a real area of\nthe Virginia Tech campus show that the proposed environment-aware drone\ndeployment framework with Google Earth input significantly enhances the network\nperformance in terms of coverage and energy consumption, compared to classical\ndeployment approaches that do not exploit geographical information. In\nparticular, the results show that the proposed approach yields a coverage\nenhancement by a factor of 2, and a 65% improvement in energy-efficiency. The\nresults have also shown the existence of an optimal number of drones that leads\nto a maximum wireless coverage performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 04:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

To address these issues, we propose a hybrid\nfusion framework where only the protected modalities are combined to fulfill\nthe requirement of secrecy and performance improvement. This paper presents a\nmethod to integrate cancelable modalities utilizing mean-closure weighting\n(MCW) score level and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory based decision level fusion\nfor iris and fingerprint to mitigate the limitations in the individual score or\ndecision fusion mechanisms. The proposed hybrid fusion scheme incorporates the\nsimilarity scores from different matchers corresponding to each protected\nmodality. The individual scores obtained from different matchers for each\nmodality are combined using MCW score fusion method. The MCW technique achieves\nthe optimal weight for each matcher involved in the score computation. Further,\nDS theory is applied to the induced scores to output the final decision. The\nrigorous experimental evaluations on three virtual databases indicate that the\nproposed hybrid fusion framework outperforms over the component level or\nindividual fusion methods (score level and decision level fusion). As a result,\nwe achieve (48%,66%), (72%,86%) and (49%,38%) of performance improvement over\nunimodal cancelable iris and unimodal cancelable fingerprint verification\nsystems for Virtual_A, Virtual_B and Virtual_C databases, respectively.

Accuracy of age estimation of face images in\nthe wild is relatively low for existing methods, because they only take into\naccount the global features, while neglecting the fine-grained features of\nage-sensitive areas. We propose a novel method based on our attention long\nshort-term memory (AL) network for fine-grained age estimation in the wild,\ninspired by the fine-grained categories and the visual attention mechanism.\nThis method combines the residual networks (ResNets) or the residual network of\nresidual network (RoR) models with LSTM units to construct AL-ResNets or AL-RoR\nnetworks to extract local features of age-sensitive regions, which effectively\nimproves the age estimation accuracy. First, a ResNets or a RoR model\npretrained on ImageNet dataset is selected as the basic model, which is then\nfine-tuned on the IMDB-WIKI-101 dataset for age estimation. Then, we fine-tune\nthe ResNets or the RoR on the target age datasets to extract the global\nfeatures of face images. To extract the local features of age-sensitive\nregions, the LSTM unit is then presented to obtain the coordinates of the\nagesensitive region automatically. Finally, the age group classification is\nconducted directly on the Adience dataset, and age-regression experiments are\nperformed by the Deep EXpectation algorithm (DEX) on MORPH Album 2, FG-NET and\n15/16LAP datasets. By combining the global and the local features, we obtain\nour final prediction results.

However, it is not yet well-understood to what extent\nontological knowledge, e.g. given as a set of (existential) rules, can be\nembedded in a principled way. To address this shortcoming, in this paper we\nintroduce a general framework based on a view of relations as regions, which\nallows us to study the compatibility between ontological knowledge and\ndifferent types of vector space embeddings. Our technical contribution is\ntwo-fold. First, we show that some of the most popular existing embedding\nmethods are not capable of modelling even very simple types of rules, which in\nparticular also means that they are not able to learn the type of dependencies\ncaptured by such rules. Second, we study a model in which relations are\nmodelled as convex regions. We show particular that ontologies which are\nexpressed using so-called quasi-chained existential rules can be exactly\nrepresented using convex regions, such that any set of facts which is induced\nusing that vector space embedding is logically consistent and deductively\nclosed with respect to the input ontology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 10:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 05:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 14:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

We compute exactly the limiting behaviour of the hydrodynamic\ninteractions between two spherical (circular) active swimmers in very close\nproximity to one another in the general setting in both three and (two)\ndimensions. Combining this with far-field interactions, we develop a novel\nnumerical scheme which allows us to study the collective behaviour of large\nnumbers of active particles with accurate hydrodynamic interactions when close\nto one another. We study active swimmers whose intrinsic flow fields are\ncharacterised by force dipoles and quadrupoles. Using this scheme, we are able\nto show that lubrication forces when the particles are very close to each other\ncan play as important a role as long-range hydrodynamic interactions in\ndetermining their many-body behaviour. We find that when the swimmer force\ndipole is large, finite clusters and open gel-like clusters appear rather than\ncomplete phase separation. This suppression is due to near-field lubrication\ninteractions. For swimmers with small force dipoles, we find surprisingly that\na globally polar ordered phase appears because near-field lubrication rather\nthan long-range hydrodnamics dominate the alignment mechanism. Polar order is\npresent for very large system sizes and is stable to fluctuations with a finite\nnoise amplitude. We explain the emergence of polar order using a minimal model\nin which only the leading rotational effect of the near-field interaction is\nincluded.

At\nthe unprecedented sensitivity level that the new generation of CMB experiments\naims to reach, every uncontrolled instrumental systematic effect will\npotentially result in an analysis bias that is larger than the much\nsought-after CMB $B$-mode signal. The absolute calibration of the polarisation\nangle is particularly important in this sense, as any associated error will end\nup in a leakage from the much larger $E$ modes into $B$ modes.

A standard approach to modeling this problem is Inductive\nMatrix Completion where the predicted rating is modeled as an inner product of\nthe user and the item features projected onto a latent space. In order to learn\nthe parameters effectively from a small number of observed ratings, the latent\nspace is constrained to be low-dimensional which implies that the parameter\nmatrix is constrained to be low-rank. However, such bilinear modeling of the\nratings can be limiting in practice and non-linear prediction functions can\nlead to significant improvements. A natural approach to introducing\nnon-linearity in the prediction function is to apply a non-linear activation\nfunction on top of the projected user/item features. Imposition of\nnon-linearities further complicates an already challenging problem that has two\nsources of non-convexity: a) low-rank structure of the parameter matrix, and b)\nnon-linear activation function. We show that one can still solve the non-linear\nInductive Matrix Completion problem using gradient descent type methods as long\nas the solution is initialized well. That is, close to the optima, the\noptimization function is strongly convex and hence admits standard optimization\ntechniques, at least for certain activation functions, such as Sigmoid and\ntanh. We also highlight the importance of the activation function and show how\nReLU can behave significantly differently than say a sigmoid function.

However, the order can be\ndrastically reduced by converting the factorization problem to an optimization\none and solving it using a quantum computer. Recent works involving both\ntheoretical and experimental approaches use Shor's algorithm, adiabatic quantum\ncomputation and quantum annealing principles to factorize integers. However,\nour work makes use of the generalized Grover's algorithm as proposed by Liu,\nwith an optimal version of classical algorithm/analytic algebra. We utilize the\nphase-matching property of the above algorithm for only amplitude amplification\npurposes to avoid an inherent phase factor that prevents perfect implementation\nof the algorithm. Here we experimentally demonstrate the factorization of two\nbi-primes, 4088459 and 966887 using IBM's 5- and 16-qubit quantum processors,\nhence making those the largest numbers that have been factorized on a quantum\ndevice.

In contrast,\nvehicle detection and semantic segmentation each only concern one of the two.\nWe propose to tackle this problem with a semantic boundary-aware multi-task\nlearning network.

Currently, datasets with\npixel-wise annotation for vehicle extraction are ISPRS dataset and IEEE GRSS\nDFC2015 dataset over Zeebrugge, which specializes in semantic segmentation.\nTherefore, we built a new, more challenging dataset for vehicle instance\nsegmentation, called the Busy Parking Lot UAV Video dataset, and we make our\ndataset available at http://www.sipeo.bgu.tum.de/download so that it can be\nused to benchmark future vehicle instance segmentation algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 13:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

To achieve this, we automatically analyze hundreds of\nthousands of Mg II h&k line profiles from a set of 33 flares, and use a machine\nlearning technique which we call supervised hierarchical k-means, to cluster\nall profile shapes. We identify a single peaked Mg II profile, in contrast to\nthe double-peaked quiet Sun profiles, appearing in every flare. Additionally,\nwe find extremely broad profiles with characteristic blue shifted central\nreversals appearing at the front of fast-moving flare ribbons. These profiles\noccur during the impulsive phase of the flare, and we present results of their\ntemporal and spatial correlation with non-thermal hard X-ray signatures,\nsuggesting that flare-accelerated electrons play an important role in the\nformation of these profiles. The ratio of the integrated Mg II h&k lines can\nalso serve as an opacity diagnostic, and we find higher opacities during each\nflare maximum. Our study shows that machine learning is a powerful tool for\nlarge scale statistical solar analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 15:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

It is usually measured by three major factors:\nscalability, throughput, and latency. Scalability refers to how the system\ncapacity is increased by adding more physical resources. Throughput measures\nthe volume of transactions for a given period of time, where most current\nsolutions attempt to improve such as NEO, EOS, etc. Latency measures the\nprocessing time of any single transaction. In current blockchain based systems,\nthe block generation rate is the main latency bottleneck. Off-chain processes\nsuch as state channels are the most recent work that can integrate partial\ninbound transactions, reducing latency. Unfortunately, the state channel\nintroduces more issues at the same time, such as cross-channel synchronization,\nwhich makes the state channel unavailable for full adoption of current\nblockchain solutions.\n  In order to solve the efficiency problem, we proposed an end-to-end solution\ncalled ALZA, which links the dedicated high-throughput blockchain with\nself-organizing payment fields. This mechanism allows arbitrary set of users to\ncreate payment fields that process extremely low latency transactions within\neach field. Therefore, users can make transactions almost immediately. Since\nall transactions are conducted within fields, transaction costs will be reduced\nby several orders of magnitude. In addition, ALZA distributes main ledger to\neach client through an innovative replication mechanism. Therefore, the system\nwill be significantly more robust to blockchain system failures. In theory,\nALZA can complete millions of transactions in one second, which naturally\nsupports high-frequency trading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 19:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 18:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 07:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 06:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 06:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 19:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2018 01:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 02:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 22:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

Due to very large number of disk drives used in exascale\ndatacenters and their high failure rates, the disk subsystem in storage systems\nhas become a major source of Data Unavailability (DU) and Data Loss (DL)\ninitiated by human errors.

However, this station is located at about 50 m from\nthe main road to the volcano's crater and since 2009 its seismograms also\nrecord a significant diurnal cultural noise due mostly to tourist tours to Mt.\nVesuvius. Herein, we investigate whether the different seismic frequency\nbetween day and night times could be an artifact of the peculiar cultural noise\nthat affects this station mostly from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm from spring to fall.\nThis time-distributed cultural noise should evidently reduce the possibility to\ndetect low magnitude earthquakes during those hours but not high magnitude\nevents. Using hourly distributions referring to different magnitude thresholds\nfrom M = 0.2 to M = 2.0, the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency diagram\napplied to the day and night-time sub-catalogs and Montecarlo statistical\nmodeling, we demonstrate that the day-night asymmetry persists despite an\nevident disruption induced by cultural noise during day-hours. In particular,\nfor the period 1999-2017, and for earthquakes with M > 2 we found a\nGutenberg-Richter exponent b = 1.66 +/- 0.07 for the night-time events and b =\n2.06 +/- 0.07 for day-time events. Moreover, we repeat the analysis also for an\nolder BKE catalog covering the period from 1992 to 2000 when cultural noise was\nnot present. The analysis confirms a higher seismic nocturnal activity that is\nalso characterized by a smaller Gutenberg-Richter exponent b for M > 2\nearthquakes relative to the day-time activity. Thus, the found night-day\nseismic asymmetric behavior is likely due to a real physical feature affecting\nMt. Vesuvius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 17:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

LOD\nis herein assumed to be mostly the result of the overall circulations occurring\nwithin the ocean-atmospheric system. We find that LOD is negatively correlated\nwith the global SST and with both the integral function of ZI and NAO, which\nare labeled as IZI and INAO. A first result is that LOD must be driven by a\nclimatic change induced by an external (e.g. solar/astronomical) forcing since\ninternal variability alone would have likely induced a positive correlation\namong the same variables because of the conservation of the Earth's angular\nmomentum. A second result is that the high correlation among the variables\nimplies that the LOD and INAO records can be adopted as global proxies to\nreconstruct past climate change. Tentative global SST reconstructions since the\n17th century suggest that around 1700, that is during the coolest period of the\nLittle Ice Age (LIA), SST could have been about 1.0-1.5 {\\deg}C cooler than the\n1950-1980 period.

Yet, my analysis did not require such two parameters. In\nfact: 1) using the MSC-CCA reduced-rank option neither changes the result nor\nwas needed since Scafetta (2016) statistically evaluated the significance of\nthe coherence spectral peaks; 2) the analysis algorithm neither contains nor\nneeded the regularization term. Herein, I show that Holm could not replicate\nScafetta (2016) because he used different analysis algorithms. In fact,\nalthough Holm claimed to be using MSC-CCA, for his figures 2-4 he used a MatLab\ncode labeled \"gcs_cca_1D.m\" (see paragraph 2 of his Section 3), which Holm also\nmodified, that implements a different methodology known as the Generalized\nCoherence Spectrum using the Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCS-CCA).

On the\ncontrary, the MSC-CCA method is stable and reliable. Moreover, Holm could not\nreplicate my result also in his figure 5 because there he used the basic Welch\nMSC algorithm by erroneously equating it to MSC-CCA.

The goal of this tool is to increase efficiency and\nequitability, while collecting data to inform further studies. We use this\ndata, combined with public data on venture investments in the USA, to draw\nconclusions about the characteristics of venture financing rounds.

To remedy the rigidity and annotation\nburden of standard approaches, we address the problem of few-shot segmentation:\ngiven few image and few pixel supervision, segment any images accordingly. We\npropose guided networks, which extract a latent task representation from any\namount of supervision, and optimize our architecture end-to-end for fast,\naccurate few-shot segmentation. Our method can switch tasks without further\noptimization and quickly update when given more guidance. We report the first\nresults for segmentation from one pixel per concept and show real-time\ninteractive video segmentation.
