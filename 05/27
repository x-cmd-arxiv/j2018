Our approach enables to simulate three classical network models\n(random, small-world and scale-free) with easily adjustable model parameters\nand network size. To be able to compare different networks, for a single\nexperimental setup we kept the number of edges and vertices fixed across the\nmodels. To understand how they change depending on the number of nodes and\nedges we ran over 30,000 simulations and analysed different network\ncharacteristics that cannot be derived analytically. Two of the main findings\nfrom the analysis are that the average shortest path does not change with the\ndensity of the scale-free network but changes for small-world and random\nnetworks; the apparent difference in mean betweenness centrality of the\nscale-free network compared with random and small-world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 18:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

This is a regulatory process\nthrough which epithelial cells (ECs) acquire mesenchymal characteristics and\ntransform to mesenchymal-like cells (MCs).

Despite the success of this theory in the description of several\nhadronic processes, the elastic scattering is still a theoretical challenge.\nThis process is characterized by a small transferred momentum and the\nperturbative techniques are not applicable. Although nonperturbative results\nhave been obtained in recent years, we still do not have a full description\nwithin QCD of the quantities related to the elastic scattering, for example,\n$\\sigma_{tot}$, the $\\rho$ parameter and $\\sigma_{el}$. In this thesis, the\nmain interest is in the energy dependence of the ratio\n$X=\\sigma_{el}/\\sigma_{tot}$, $\\sigma_{tot}$ and $\\rho$. These topics are\ndivided into three different studies. In the first topic, we develop an\nempirical analysis on the ratio $X$. By means of parameterizations with a small\nnumber of free parameters, we have obtained good descriptions of the data on\n$pp$ and $\\bar{p}p$ scattering.

In the third topic, two sub-leading terms for\n$\\sigma_{tot}$, obtained in a nonperturbative QCD approach, are considered in\nfits to $pp$ and $\\bar{p}p$ data and also in fits to data from meson-baryon and\nother baryon-baryon scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 21:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

Small training sets are in fact of no use to\ndeep networks as, due to the large number of trainable parameters, they will\nvery likely be subject to overfitting phenomena. On the other hand, the\nincrement of the training set size through further manual or semi-automatic\nlabellings can be costly, if not possible at times. Thus, the standard\ntechniques to address this issue are transfer learning and data augmentation,\nwhich consists of applying some sort of \"transformation\" to existing labeled\ninstances to let the training set grow in size. Although this approach works\nwell in applications such as image classification, where it is relatively\nsimple to design suitable transformation operators, it is not obvious how to\napply it in more structured scenarios. Motivated by the observation that in\nvirtually all application domains it is easy to obtain unlabeled data, in this\npaper we take a different perspective and propose a \\emph{label augmentation}\napproach. We start from a small, curated labeled dataset and let the labels\npropagate through a larger set of unlabeled data using graph transduction\ntechniques. This allows us to naturally use (second-order) similarity\ninformation which resides in the data, a source of information which is\ntypically neglected by standard augmentation techniques. In particular, we show\nthat by using known game theoretic transductive processes we can create larger\nand accurate enough labeled datasets which use results in better trained neural\nnetworks. Preliminary experiments are reported which demonstrate a consistent\nimprovement over standard image classification datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2018 21:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

Although the\neffect of disorders on carrier mobility has been widely studied, how\nelectrostatic field distribution is distorted by the presence of disorders and\nits effect on charge transport remain unanswered.

Finally, a perspective toward the future applications of\nquasiparticle interference techniques on topological materials is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2018 07:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

In non-topological\njunctions when the charging energy is small compared to the Josephson tunneling\nscale the low energy physics is described by 2pi phase slips. By contrast, in a\ntopological junction, due to the 4pi periodicity of the tunneling term it is\nusually expected that only 4pi phase slips are possible while 2pi phase slips\nare suppressed. However, we find that if the ratio between the strengths of the\nMajorana assisted tunneling and the Josephson tunneling is small, as is likely\nto be the case for many setups, 2pi phase slips occur and may even dominate the\nlow energy physics. In this limit one can view the 4pi phase slips as a pair of\n2pi phase slips with arbitrarily large separation.

The\nDTLC has a multiple-layer tree structure in which the ON or OFF of the child\nnode codes is controlled by the parent node codes. By using this architecture\nhierarchically, we can obtain the latent space in which the lower layer codes\nare selectively used depending on the higher layer ones. To make the latent\ncodes capture salient semantic features of images in a hierarchically\ndisentangled manner in the DTLC, we also propose a hierarchical conditional\nmutual information regularization and optimize it with a newly defined\ncurriculum learning method that we propose as well.

The\nmagnetic moments of Fe cations follow a type-II ferrimagnetic and ferroelectric\nordering with a calculated total magnetic moment of 4.25 per unit cell\n(Fe6Se8). The strong covalent bonding nature of Fe-Se leads to its\nferroelectric properties. In addition, the symmetry analysis suggests that\ntilting of Fe sub-lattice with 3d-t2g orbital ordering is due to the\nJahn-Teller (JT) distortion. This study provides further insight in the\ndevelopment of spintronics related technology using multiferroic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2018 11:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

Here we show that with the addition of a $54_H$ to the symmetry\nbreaking sector, the successful predictions of these models for fermion masses\nand mixings can be maintained. The $54_H$ enables a reduction of the $B-L$\nsymmetry breaking scale to an intermediate value of order $10^{12}$ GeV,\nconsistent with the observed neutrino mass spectrum, while preserving\nperturbative gauge coupling unification.

Modeling to date has either used\nanalytical or semi-analytical implementation of dynamical methods or Monte\nCarlo simulations. The former approach is too simplified to accurately assess\nthe noise performance in real laser systems, while the latter approach is too\ncomputationally slow to optimize the performance as parameters vary over a wide\nrange. Here, we describe a computational implementation of dynamical methods\nthat allows us to determine the noise performance of a passively modelocked\nlaser within minutes on a desktop computer and is faster than Monte Carlo\nmethods by a factor on the order of 1000. We apply this method to characterize\na laser that is locked using a fast saturable absorber---for example, a\nfiber-based nonlinear polarization rotation---and a laser that is locked using\na slow saturable absorber---for example, a semiconductor saturable absorbing\nmirror.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2018 13:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Crosslinking of electrospun\nfibres from gelatin is required to prevent dissolution in water, to retain the\noriginal nanofibre morphology after immersion in water, and to improve the\nthermal and mechanical properties, although this is still challenging to\naccomplish in a controlled fashion. In this study, we have investigated the\nscalable manufacture and structural stability in aqueous environment of a\nUV-cured nanofibrous membrane fabricated by free surface electrospinning (FSES)\nof aqueous solutions containing vinylbenzylated gelatin and\npoly(epsilon-caprolactone) dimethacrylate (PCL-DMA). Vinylbenzylated gelatin\nwas obtained via chemical functionalisation with photopolymerisable\n4-vinylbenzyl chloride (4VBC) groups, so that the gelatin and PCL phase in\nelectrospun fibres were integrated in a covalent UV-cured co-network at the\nmolecular scale, rather than being simply physically mixed. UV-cured\nnanofibrous membranes did not dissolve in water and showed enhanced thermal and\nmechanical properties, with respect to as-spun samples, indicating the\neffectiveness of the photo-crosslinking reaction. In addition, UV-cured\ngelatin/PCL membranes displayed increased structural stability in water with\nrespect to PCL-free samples and were highly tolerated by G292 osteosarcoma\ncells. These results therefore support the use of PCL DMA as hydrophobic,\nbiodegradable crosslinker and provide new insight on the scalable design of\nwater insoluble, mechanical competent gelatin membranes for healthcare\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2018 15:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 05:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}
