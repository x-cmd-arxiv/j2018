We find that the interstellar atomic gas shows good spatial correlation\nwith the gamma rays, indicating that the TeV gamma rays from RCW 86 are likely\nto be dominantly of hadronic origin. In contrast, the spatial correlation\nbetween the interstellar molecular cloud and the TeV gamma rays is poor in the\nsoutheastern shell of the SNR. We argue that this poor correlation can be\nattributed to the low-energy cosmic rays (~ 1 TeV) not penetrating into the\ndense molecular cloud due to an enhancement of the turbulent magnetic field\naround the dense cloud of ~ 10-100 $\\mu$G. We also find that the southwestern\nshell, which is bright in both synchrotron X-ray and radio continuum radiation,\nshows a significant gamma-ray excess compared with the interstellar proton\ncolumn density, suggesting that leptonic gamma rays via inverse Compton\nscattering possibly contributes along with hadronic gamma rays. The total\ncosmic-ray energies of the young TeV gamma-ray SNRs$-$RX J1713.7$-$3946, Vela\nJr, HESS J1731$-$347, and RCW 86$-$are roughly similar, which indicates that\ncosmic rays can be accelerated in both the core-collapse and Type Ia\nsupernovae. The total energy of cosmic rays derived using the gas density, ~\n10$^{48}$-10$^{49}$ erg, gives a safe lower limit due mainly to the low filling\nfactor of interstellar gas within the shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2018 16:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 13:23:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 18:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 14:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

A discriminator network is optimized to\ndistinguish the registration-predicted displacement fields from the motion data\nsimulated by finite element analysis. During training, the registration network\nsimultaneously aims to maximize similarity between anatomical labels that\ndrives image alignment and to minimize an adversarial generator loss that\nmeasures divergence between the predicted- and simulated deformation. The\nend-to-end trained network enables efficient and fully-automated registration\nthat only requires an MR and TRUS image pair as input, without anatomical\nlabels or simulated data during inference. 108 pairs of labelled MR and TRUS\nimages from 76 prostate cancer patients and 71,500 nonlinear finite-element\nsimulations from 143 different patients were used for this study.

Inclusive fitness can be used to calculate selection on\na focal gene, but it is also applied to whole organisms. Individuals are then\npredicted to appear designed as if to maximise their inclusive fitness,\nprovided that certain conditions are met (formally when interactions between\nindividuals are 'additive'). Here we argue that applying the concept of\ninclusive fitness to organisms is justified under far broader conditions than\npreviously shown, but only if it is appropriately defined. Specifically, we\npropose that organisms should maximise the sum of their offspring (including\nany accrued due to the behaviour/phenotype of relatives), plus any effects on\ntheir relatives' offspring production, weighted by relatedness. In contrast,\nmost theoreticians have argued that a focal individual's inclusive fitness\nshould exclude any offspring accrued due to the behaviour of relatives. Our\napproach is based on the notion that long-term evolution follows the genome's\n'majority interest' of building coherent bodies that are efficient 'vehicles'\nfor gene propagation. A gene favoured by selection that reduces the propagation\nof unlinked genes at other loci (e.g. meiotic segregation distorters that lower\nsperm production) is eventually neutralised by counter-selection throughout the\nrest of the genome.

A common approach to reduce the cost of inference is\nto reduce its memory complexity by lowering the entropy of the weight matrices\nof the neural network, e.g., by pruning and quantizing their elements. However,\nthe quantized weight matrices are then usually represented either by a dense or\nsparse matrix storage format, whose associated dot product complexity is not\nbounded by the entropy of the matrix. This means that the associated inference\ncomplexity ultimately depends on the implicit statistical assumptions that\nthese matrix representations make about the weight distribution, which can be\nin many cases suboptimal. In this paper we address this issue and present new\nefficient representations for matrices with low entropy statistics. These new\nmatrix formats have the novel property that their memory and algorithmic\ncomplexity are implicitly bounded by the entropy of the matrix, consequently\nimplying that they are guaranteed to become more efficient as the entropy of\nthe matrix is being reduced. In our experiments we show that performing the dot\nproduct under these new matrix formats can indeed be more energy and time\nefficient under practically relevant assumptions.

For one, CNNs typically require large quantities of labeled input data\nfor training.

Since gamblets can be\ncomputed in $\\mathcal{O}(N \\operatorname{polylog} N)$ complexity and are\nlocalized both in space and eigenspace, the proposed method is of near-linear\ncomplexity and generalizable to non-homogeneous noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 02:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

The reactive policy is\nupdated under supervision from the non-reactive policy, while the non-reactive\npolicy is improved with guidance from the reactive policy. In this work we\nstudy this Dual Policy Iteration (DPI) strategy in an alternating optimization\nframework and provide a convergence analysis that extends existing API theory.\nWe also develop a special instance of this framework which reduces the update\nof non-reactive policies to model-based optimal control using learned local\nmodels, and provides a theoretically sound way of unifying model-free and\nmodel-based RL approaches with unknown dynamics.

For\ninstance, an early PTV experiment observed particles moving at the normal fluid\nvelocity $v_n$, while a PIV experiment observed particles moving at $v_n/2$,\nthough the range of heat flux applied in these experiments differed by an order\nof magnitude. To resolve this apparent discrepancy and explore statistics of\nparticle motion in thermal counterflow, we have applied PTV to a wide range of\nheat flux at several fluid temperatures. We introduce a scheme for analyzing\nthe velocity of particles presumably moving with the normal fluid separately\nfrom those presumably influenced by the vortex tangle. Our results show two\ndistinct peaks in the streamwise particle velocity PDF (probability density\nfunction) for lower heat flux, one centered at the normal fluid velocity $v_n$\n(\"G2\") and one near $v_n/2$ (\"G1\"). For higher heat flux there is a single peak\ncentered near $v_n/2$ (\"G3\"). Using our separation scheme we show there is no\nsize difference between particles contributing to G1 and G2. We also show that\nnon-classical features of the transverse velocity PDF arise entirely from G1,\nwhile the corresponding PDF for G2 exhibits classical Gaussian form. G2\ntransverse velocity fluctuation, backed up by second sound attenuation in\ndecaying counterflow, suggests large scale turbulence in the normal fluid is\nabsent from the two peak region. We offer a brief discussion of physical\nmechanisms that may be responsible for our observations, revealing that G1\nvelocity fluctuations may be linked to fluctuations of vortex line velocity,\nand suggest numerical simulations that may reveal underlying physics in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 04:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Among various models to explain observations,\nsynchrotron radiation from the electron population different from radio to IR\nemitting electrons is promising.

Recently, we proposed that this electron\npopulation is produced by proton-photon collisions (mainly, Bethe-Heitler\nprocess), and we applied this model to PKS 0637-752.

The target photons for electron-positron pair\nproduction are supplied by synchrotron radiation at radio-IR by primary\nelectrons and by the active galactic nucleus (AGN) core as well as cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) radiation. The effects of the AGN photons are\nincluded for the first time in the hadronic model. Though the observed X-ray\nflux is obtained with the contribution of the AGN photons, the required proton\npower turns out to be highly super-Eddington. However, we find that our model\nworks for a nearly Eddington proton power, if the photon density of the AGN is\nenhanced.

In the binary star system of a white dwarf (WD) and\nits non-degenerate companion star, the WD accretes either H-rich matter or He\nand undergoes H and He shell-burning. We summarize how such shell-burning\ndepend on the accretion rate and the WD mass and how the WD blows strong wind.\nWe identify the following evolutionary routes for the accreting WD to trigger a\nthermonuclear explosion. With a decreasing rate with time, 5 phases are\nobserved: 1. The WD increases its mass by stable H burning and blows a strong\nwind, which strips a part of the companion star's envelope to control the\naccretion rate and forms circumstellar matter (CSM). The WD may explode within\nCSM as an \"SN Ia-CSM\". 2. The wind stops and an SN Ia is triggered under\nsteady-stable H shell-burning, which is observed as a super-soft X-ray source:\n\"SN Ia-SSXS\". 3. H shell-burning becomes unstable and many flashes recur. The\nWD undergoes recurrent nova (RN) whose mass ejection is smaller than the\naccreted matter, evolving to an \"SN Ia-RN\". 4. If the companion is a He star or\nWD, the accretion of He can trigger He and C double detonations at the\nsub-Chandrasekhar (sub-Chand) mass or the WD grows to the Chand mass while\nproducing and He-wind: \"SN Ia-He CSM\". 5. If the accreting WD rotates rapidly,\ndelayed trigger of an SN Ia beyond standard Chand mass can happen. The\n(super-Chand) WD contracts to become a delayed SN Ia after losing angular\nmomentum. The companion star has become a He WD and CSM has disappeared: \"SN\nIa-He WD\". We update nucleosynthesis yields of the carbon deflagration model\nW7, delayed detonation model WDD2, and the sub-Chand mass model to constrain\nthe yields (such as Mn) by comparing the observations.

Predicting the final-configuration\nprobability of flipping cars for example remains extremely challenging. In this\npaper we introduce new statistical methodologies to solve these challenging\nmacroscopic problems. Boltzmann's principles in statistical mechanics have been\nwell recognized for a century for their usefulness in explaining thermodynamic\nproperties of matter in gas, liquid and solid phases. Studied systems usually\ninvolve a large number of particles at the atomic scales. However, it is\nunusual for Boltzmann's principles to be applied to individual objects at\ncentimeter to human-size length scales. We show that the concept of statistical\nmechanics still holds for describing the probability of a tossed dice landing\non a particular face. For regular dice, the one in six probability that the\ndice land on each face is well known. In the case of orthorhombic dice, this\nsymmetry is broken and hence we need new tools to predict the probability of\nlanding on each face. We propose a new method based on Boltzmann's principles\nwhich uses synthetic temperature term. Surprisingly, this approach requires\nonly the dimensions of the thrown object for calculating potential energy as\nthe input, with no other fitting parameters needed. The statistical predictions\nfor landing fit well to experimental data of over fifty-thousand samplings of\ndice in 23 different dimensions. We believe that the ability to predict, in a\nsimple and tractable manner, the outcomes of macroscopic movement of large\nscale probabilistic phenomena opens up a new line of approach for explaining\nmany phenomena in the critical centimeter length scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 08:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

A weak signature set may considerably cause an increase in false alarm\nrate, making impractical to deploy the system. The objective of the paper is to\nidentify the flaws in the signature structure which are responsible to reduce\nthe efficiency of the detection system. The paper targets SQL injection\nsignatures particularly. Initially, some essential concepts of the domain of\nthe attack that should be focused by the developer in prior to designing the\nsignatures have been discussed. Afterwards, we conducted a case study on the\nwell known PHPIDS tool for analyzing the quality of its SQL signatures. Based\non the analysis, we identify various flaws in the designing practice that yield\ninefficient signatures. We divide the weak signatures into six categories,\nnamely incomplete, irrelevant, semi-relevant, susceptible, redundant and\ninconsistent signatures. Moreover, we quantify these weaknesses and define them\nmathematically in terms of set theory. To the best of our knowledge, we have\nidentified some novel signature design issues. The paper will basically assist\nthe signature developer to know what level of expertise is required for\ndevising a quality signature set and how a little ignorance may lead to\ndeterioration in the performance of the SIDS.

In this study, this phenomenon is investigated as a problem of energy\ndiffusion expressed by the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model. The\nconventional gradient-diffusion approximation for the turbulent energy flux\ncannot account for the enhanced energy transport observed in rotating\ninhomogeneous turbulence. In order to adequately describe the phenomenon, we\npropose a new model for the energy flux due to the pressure associated with the\nrotational motion of a fluid. The model of the energy flux is expressed to be\nproportional to the turbulent helicity. This property is closely related to the\ngroup velocity of inertial waves in a rapidly rotating fluid. The validity of\nthe model is assessed using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of\ninhomogeneous turbulence under rotation. It is shown that most of the turbulent\nenergy transport enhanced by the system rotation is attributed to the pressure\ndiffusion term. The spatial distribution of the energy flux due to the pressure\nrelated to the system rotation is similar to that of the turbulent helicity\nwith negative coefficient. Hence, the new model which is proportional to the\nturbulent helicity is able to qualitatively account for the enhanced energy\nflux due to the system rotation. Finally, the helical Rossby number is proposed\nin order to estimate the relative importance of the energy flux enhanced by the\nturbulent helicity and the rotation, in comparison to the conventional\ngradient-diffusion approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 10:08:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 11:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Further, various types of attacks on a biometric system may reveal the\noriginal template and utility in other applications. To address these security\nand privacy concerns cancelable biometric has been introduced. Cancelable\nbiometric constructs a protected template from the original biometric template\nusing transformation functions and performs the comparison between templates in\nthe transformed domain. Recent approaches towards cancelable fingerprint\ngeneration either rely on aligning minutiae points with respect to singular\npoints (core/delta) or utilize the absolute coordinate positions of minutiae\npoints. In this paper, we propose a novel non-invertible ridge feature\ntransformation method to protect the original fingerprint template information.\nThe proposed method partitions the fingerprint region into a number of sectors\nwith reference to each minutia point employing a ridge-based co-ordinate\nsystem.

The results of V,\nNb and Mo systems, which were studied before in our group, are compared with\nthe result of present study and a systematic pattern in diffusion behavior is\nfound with increasing atomic number of the elements, group-wise in the periodic\ntable. These studies help to understand the growth kinetics of the phases\nformed, diffusion parameters, relative mobilities of the species and presence\nand behavior of the different defects in the crystal structure. The different\ndiffusion parameters calculated in present study are, parabolic growth\nconstants, integrated diffusion coefficients, activation energy for diffusion,\nratio of tracer diffusivities and tracer diffusivity of the species\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 10:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-29"}

However, StarGAN is unable to match multiple translation\nmappings when encountering general translations with very diverse domain\nshifts.

Responses to\nexternal stimuli are generated by a neuronal population as a whole or the\nindividual neurons have encoding capacities of their own. The SPIKE-distance\nestimated either for a single, pooled spike train over a population or for each\nneuron separately can serve to quantify these responses.\n  New Method: For the SP case we compare three algorithms that search for the\nmost discriminative subpopulation over all stimulus pairs. For the LL case we\nintroduce a new algorithm that combines neurons that individually separate\ndifferent pairs of stimuli best.\n  Results: The best approach for SP is a brute force search over all possible\nsubpopulations. However, it is only feasible for small populations. For more\nrealistic settings, simulated annealing clearly outperforms gradient algorithms\nwith only a limited increase in computational load. Our novel LL approach can\nhandle very involved coding scenarios despite its computational ease.\n  Comparison with Existing Methods: Spike train distances have been extended to\nthe analysis of neural populations interpolating between SP and LL coding.

Despite its potential, the support for parallel computers is\nrather limited. The cause is largely the irregularity of the algorithm and the\nunderlying heuristics imply a sequential nature. In this paper a GPU based\nparallelized version of the Louvain method is presented. The Louvain method is\na multi-phase, iterative heuristic for modularity optimization. It was\noriginally developed by Blondel et al.

Here\nwe perform a systematic investigation of the electronic, optical, mechanical\nand thermal properties of $I4_1/amd$ hydrogen at 495 GPa using first-principles\ncalculations. We calculate the electronic structure and dielectric function to\nverify the metallic behaviour of $I4_1/amd$ hydrogen. The calculated total\nplasma frequency from both intraband and interband transitions, 33.40 eV,\nagrees well with the experimental result. The mechanical properties including\nelastic stability and sound velocity are also investigated. The mechanical\nstability of $I4_1/amd$ hydrogen is limited by shear modulus other than bulk\nmodulus, and the high Young's modulus indicates that $I4_1/amd$ hydrogen is a\nstiff material. After investigating the lattice vibrational properties, we\nstudy the thermodynamical properties and lattice anharmonicity to understand\nthermal behaviours in metallic hydrogen. Finally, the lattice thermal\nconductivity of $I4_1/amd$ hydrogen is calculated to be 194.72 W/mK and 172.96\nW/mK along the $x$ and $z$ directions, respectively.

We\napproach the problem with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and propose a\nnovel (deep) face hallucination model that incorporates identity priors into\nthe learning procedure. The model consists of two main parts: i) a cascaded\nsuper-resolution network that upscales the low-resolution images, and ii) an\nensemble of face recognition models that act as identity priors for the\nsuper-resolution network during training. Different from competing\nsuper-resolution approaches that typically rely on a single model for upscaling\n(even with large magnification factors), our network uses a cascade of multiple\nSR models that progressively upscale the low-resolution images using steps of\n$2\\times$. This characteristic allows us to apply supervision signals (target\nappearances) at different resolutions and incorporate identity constraints at\nmultiple-scales. Our model is able to upscale (very) low-resolution images\ncaptured in unconstrained conditions and produce visually convincing results.\nWe rigorously evaluate the proposed model on a large datasets of facial images\nand report superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 14:25:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 07:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

Computational models of\nlifelong learning typically alleviate catastrophic forgetting in experimental\nscenarios with given datasets of static images and limited complexity, thereby\ndiffering significantly from the conditions artificial agents are exposed to.\nIn more natural settings, sequential information may become progressively\navailable over time and access to previous experience may be restricted. In\nthis paper, we propose a dual-memory self-organizing architecture for lifelong\nlearning scenarios.

Both growing networks can expand in response to\nnovel sensory experience: the episodic memory learns fine-grained\nspatiotemporal representations of object instances in an unsupervised fashion\nwhile the semantic memory uses task-relevant signals to regulate structural\nplasticity levels and develop more compact representations from episodic\nexperience. For the consolidation of knowledge in the absence of external\nsensory input, the episodic memory periodically replays trajectories of neural\nreactivations.

Following Paper I, here\nwe numerically study the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, i.e., from\nembryos to full planets, in binary systems of various orbital configurations.\nWe identify an orbital alignment or anti-alignment effect; namely, although an\ninclined binary generally misaligns the planetary orbits with respect to the\nspin axis of the primary host star (i.e., causing large obliquity), it could\nalign or anti-align the planetary orbits with respect to the binary orbit. Such\nan orbital (anti-)alignment effect is caused by the combination of orbital\ndifferential precession and self-damping, and it is mostly significant in cases\nof intermediate binary separations, i.e., a_B~40-200 AU for terrestrial planet\nformation around 1 AU from the primary stars. In such intermediate separation\nbinaries, somewhat contrary to intuition, the binary companion can aid planet\ngrowth by having increased the rate of collisions, forming significantly more\nmassive but fewer planets. In the other two ends, the companion is ether too\nclose thus plays a violently disruptive role or too wide to have significant\neffect on planet formation.

We consider the\nchemical evolution models for the Galactic disc developed by Grisoni et al.\n(2017) for the solar neighborhood, both the two-infall and the one-infall ones,\nand we extend our analysis to the other Galactocentric distances. In\nparticular, we examine the processes which mainly influence the formation of\nthe abundance gradients: the inside-out scenario, a variable star formation\nefficiency, and radial gas flows. We compare our model results with recent\nabundance patterns obtained along the Galactic disc from the APOGEE survey and\nwith abundance gradients observed from Cepheids, open clusters, HII regions and\nPNe.

We introduce a new approach to defining the discrete\nlinear canonical transform (DLCT) by employing operator theory. Operators are\nabstract entities that can have both continuous and discrete concrete\nmanifestations. Generating the continuous and discrete manifestations of LCTs\nfrom the same abstract operator framework allows us to define the continuous\nand discrete transforms in a structurally analogous manner. By utilizing\nhyperdifferential operators, we obtain a DLCT matrix which is totally\ncompatible with the theory of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its dual\nand circulant structure, which makes further analytical manipulations and\nprogress possible. The proposed DLCT is to the continuous LCT, what the DFT is\nto the continuous Fourier transform (FT). The DLCT of the signal is obtained\nsimply by multiplying the vector holding the samples of the input signal by the\nDLCT matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 13:10:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 13:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

These forces are usually relatively weaker than covalent and ionic\nbondings such that long-range intermolecular interactions should play important\nrole in dispersion properties of molecular crystals such as polymers and\nbiomolecular chain structures. In this work the effects of long but\nfinite-range intermolecular interactions on single-exciton dispersion energy,\nand hence on characteristic parameters of periodic soliton trains associated\nwith bound exciton-polariton states in one-dimensional molecular crystals\ninteracting with an electromagnetic field, are investigated. Long-range\ninteractions are shown to quantitatively modify the exciton-polariton soliton\namplitudes, width and velocity as a result of shrinkage of the single-exciton\nenergy spectrum. The soliton structures of interest are nonlinear wavetrains,\nconsisting of periodically ordered single-pulse (i.e. bright) or single-kink\n(i.e. dark) solitons with equal separation between the constituent\nsingle-soliton modes. Periodic soliton structures are relevant and best suited\nfor finite-size chain systems, where periodic boundary conditions rule the\ngeneration of nonlinear wave profiles. Generally they are of weaker\nnonlinearity compared to their single-soliton constituents as well established\nwithin the framework of their generation via the process of modulational\ninstability\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2018 22:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-06"}

To\naddress this issue, an accurate and analytical approximation of the secrecy\nrate is derived in this work. Using this approximation as the objective\nfunction, two low-complexity linear precoding methods based on gradient descend\n(GD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) are proposed. The GD-based\nmethod has much lower complexity but usually converges to a local optimum. On\nthe other hand, the SCA-based method uses semi-definite relaxation to deal with\nthe non-convexity in the precoder optimization problem and achieves\nnear-optimal solution.
