We implement a formalism for treating wind clumping - in particular\nthe light-leakage effects associated with a medium that is porous in physical\nand velocity space - into the global (photosphere+wind) NLTE model atmosphere\ncode FASTWIND. We assume a stochastic, two-component wind consisting of a\nmixture of optically thick and thin clumps embedded in a rarefied inter-clump\nmedium. We account fully for the reductions in opacity associated with porosity\nin physical and velocity-space, and for the well-known effect that opacities\ndepending on rho^2 are higher in clumpy winds than in smooth ones of equal\nmass-loss rate. By formulating our method in terms of suitable mean and\neffective opacities for the clumpy wind, we are able to compute models with the\nsame speed (~15 min. on a modern laptop) as in previous code-generations. Some\nfirst, generic results of the new models include: i) Confirming earlier results\nthat velocity-space porosity is critical for analysis of UV wind lines in\nO-stars; ii) for the optical Halpha line, optically thick clumping effects are\nsmall for O-stars, but potentially very important for late B and A-supergiants;\niii) spatial porosity is a marginal effect for absorption of high-energy X-rays\nin O-stars, as long as the mean-free path between clumps are kept at realistic\nvalues; iv) porosity is negligible at typical O-star radio-photosphere radii;\nv) regarding the wind ionization balance, a general trend is that increased\nrates of recombination in simulations with optically thin clumps lead to\noverall lower degrees of ionization than in corresponding smooth models, but\nthat this effect now is counteracted by the increased levels of light-leakage\nassociated with porosity in physical and velocity space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 16:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Among the most promising agents of feedback are cosmic rays (CRs),\nthe relativistic ion population of interstellar and intergalactic plasmas. In\nthese environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless and interact via\ncollective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale\nmagnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical\nscales requires a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic\ntheory for CR transport in the self-confinement picture, which includes CR\ndiffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields\nof Alfv\\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes\nCRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\\'en velocity if resonant\nwaves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to\ncapture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization\nschemes to ensure numerical stability. We extent the theory by deriving an\nequation for the CR momentum density along the mean magnetic field and include\na transport equation for the Alfv\\'en-wave energy. We account for energy\nexchange of CRs and Alfv\\'en waves via the gyroresonant instability and include\nother wave damping mechanisms. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that\nour new theory enables stable, self-regulated CR transport. The theory is\ncoupled to magneto-hydrodynamics, conserves the total energy and momentum, and\ncorrectly recovers previous macroscopic CR transport formalisms in the\nsteady-state flux limit. Because it is free of tunable parameters, it holds the\npromise to provide predictable simulations of CR feedback in galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 19:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Through explicit calculations, we find\ntwo features of superconductivity arising from an IM normal state: First,\ndespite the absence of quasiparticles in the normal state, the superconducting\nstate still exhibits coherent superfluid transport. Second, the\nnon-quasiparticle nature of the IM Green's functions produces a large\nenhancement in the ratio of the zero-temperature superconducting gap $\\Delta$\nand transition temperature $T_{sc}$, $2\\Delta/T_{sc}$, with respect to its BCS\nvalue of $3.53$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 16:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

It is expected that in the ideal case, a gap-opening planet\nmigrates at the viscous drift speed, which is referred to as type II migration.\nHowever, recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown that in general, the\ngap-opening planet is not locked to the viscous disk evolution. A new physical\nmodel is required to explain the migration speed of such a planet. For this\nreason, we re-examined the migration of a planet in the disk, by carrying out\nthe two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a wide parameter range. We have\nfound that the torque exerted on the gap-opening planet depends on the surface\ndensity at the bottom of the gap. The planet migration slows down as the\nsurface density of the bottom of the gap decreases. Using the gap model\ndeveloped in our previous studies, we have constructed an empirical formula of\nthe migration speed of the gap-opening planets, which is consistent with the\nresults given by the hydrodynamic simulations performed by us and other\nresearchers. Our model easily explains why the migration speed of the\ngap-opening planets can be faster than the viscous gas drift speed.

To overcome this\nlimitation and reduce overfitting caused by the training on full-resolution\nimages, we propose to employ global sum pooling (GSP) instead of GAP or fully\nconnected (FC) layers at the backend of a convolutional network.

The nature of the recently identified \"sdA\" spectroscopic class of\nstar is not well understood. The thousands of known sdAs have H-dominated\nspectra, spectroscopic surface gravities intermediate to main sequence stars\nand isolated white dwarfs, and effective temperatures below the lower limit for\nHe-burning subdwarfs. Most are likely products of binary stellar evolution,\nwhether extremely low-mass white dwarfs and their precursors, or blue\nstragglers in the halo.\n  Aims. Stellar eigenfrequencies revealed through time series photometry of\npulsating stars sensitively probe stellar structural properties. The properties\nof pulsations exhibited by any sdA stars would contribute importantly to our\ndeveloping understanding of this class.\n  Methods. We extend our photometric campaign to discover pulsating extremely\nlow-mass white dwarfs from McDonald Observatory to target sdA stars classified\nfrom SDSS spectra. We also obtain follow-up time series spectroscopy to search\nfor binary signatures from four new pulsators.\n  Results. Out of 23 sdA stars observed, we clearly detect stellar pulsations\nin seven. Dominant pulsation periods range from 4.6 minutes to 12.3 hours, with\nmost on ~hour timescales. We argue specific classifications for some of the new\nvariables, identifying both compact and likely main sequence dwarf pulsators,\nalong with a candidate low-mass RR Lyrae star.\n  Conclusions. With dominant pulsation periods spanning orders of magnitude,\nthe pulsational evidence supports the emerging narrative that the sdA class\nconsists of multiple stellar populations. Since multiple types of sdA exhibit\nstellar pulsations, follow-up asteroseismic analysis can be used to probe the\nprecise evolutionary natures and stellar structures of these individual\nsubpopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 18:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Most works focus on learning either a one-to-one\nmapping in an unsupervised way or a many-to-many mapping in a supervised way.\nHowever, a more practical setting is many-to-many mapping in an unsupervised\nway, which is harder due to the lack of supervision and the complex inner- and\ncross-domain variations. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Exemplar\nGuided & Semantically Consistent Image-to-image Translation (EGSC-IT) network\nwhich conditions the translation process on an exemplar image in the target\ndomain. We assume that an image comprises of a content component which is\nshared across domains, and a style component specific to each domain. Under the\nguidance of an exemplar from the target domain we apply Adaptive Instance\nNormalization to the shared content component, which allows us to transfer the\nstyle information of the target domain to the source domain. To avoid semantic\ninconsistencies during translation that naturally appear due to the large\ninner- and cross-domain variations, we introduce the concept of feature masks\nthat provide coarse semantic guidance without requiring the use of any semantic\nlabels. Experimental results on various datasets show that EGSC-IT does not\nonly translate the source image to diverse instances in the target domain, but\nalso preserves the semantic consistency during the process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 19:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 08:48:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 10:37:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

Targeting the\nfull generality of the congestion problem, previous schemes rely on slow,\niterative convergence to the appropriate sending rates (e.g., TIMELY takes 50\nRTTs). Several papers have shown that even in oversubscribed datacenter\nnetworks most congestion occurs at the receiver. Accordingly, we propose a\ndivide-and-specialize approach, called Dart, which isolates the common case of\nreceiver congestion and further subdivides the remaining in-network congestion\ninto the simpler spatially-localized and the harder spatially-dispersed cases.\nFor receiver congestion, we propose direct apportioning of sending rates (DASR)\nin which a receiver for n senders directs each sender to cut its rate by a\nfactor of n, converging in only one RTT. For the spatially-localized case, Dart\nprovides fast (under one RTT) response by adding novel switch hardware for\nin-order flow deflection (IOFD) because RDMA disallows packet reordering on\nwhich previous load balancing schemes rely. For the uncommon\nspatially-dispersed case, Dart falls back to DCQCN. Small-scale testbed\nmeasurements and at-scale simulations, respectively, show that Dart achieves\n60% (2.5x) and 79% (4.8x) lower 99th-percentile latency, and similar and 58%\nhigher throughput than InfiniBand, and TIMELY and DCQCN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 20:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 22:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

The approach followed here is very much in the spirit adopted\nby Peierls who eschewed a `rigorous axiomatic' and aimed at using `logic at the\nlevel of the working physicist'. The fundamental tenet of his work is that the\nwavefunction or density matrix represents the knowledge of an observer and that\ntwo observers of the same system may well have different knowledge and will use\ndifferent density matrices to describe it. Essential to the understanding of\nPeierls's approach is the demonstration given here that the density matrix\ngenerally can be expressed entirely in terms of probabilities of observable\noutcomes and that such probabilities are subjective in the first instance.The\nprocess by which the knowledge of two observers may be combined is discussed in\ndetail for some simple cases and, by using Bayes's theorem, the progress to a\ncommon understanding of the correct density matrix for a given situation\ndemonstrated.

It is pointed out that\nit is essential that the density matrices of two observers commute under all\ncircumstances no matter how inaccurate or even fanciful the data or beliefs\nused to construct them. Once this is appreciated it can be shown that Peierls's\ndensity matrix commutation criterion is fully equivalent to the standard result\nin quantum mechanics that two observables must commute if they are to be known\nprecisely and simultaneously,but now extended to imperfectly known mixed states\nrather than a single eigenstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 20:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

As known, social media data is shared through a wide range\nof modalities (e.g., text, images and audio), representing valuable information\nto be exploited for extracting valuable insights from users. Nevertheless, most\nof the current work in AP using social media data has been devoted to analyze\ntextual information only, and there are very few works that have started\nexploring the gender identification using visual information. Contrastingly,\nthis paper focuses in exploiting the visual modality to perform both age and\ngender identification in social media, specifically in Twitter. Our goal is to\nevaluate the pertinence of using visual information in solving the AP task.\nAccordingly, we have extended the Twitter corpus from PAN 2014, incorporating\nposted images from all the users, making a distinction between tweeted and\nretweeted images. Performed experiments provide interesting evidence on the\nusefulness of visual information in comparison with traditional textual\nrepresentations for the AP task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 20:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

Understanding the nature of the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission allows probing the population of high-energy particles (leptons or\nhadrons) but can be challenging for sources of small angular extent. With the\nrecent $\\textit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope data release Pass 8, we\ninvestigate the morphology of this SNR to disentangle the PWN from the SNR\ncontribution. We perform a morphological and spectral analysis from 300 MeV to\n300 GeV. We use the reconstructed events with the best angular resolution to\nseparately investigate the PWN and the SNR emissions, which is crucial to\naccurately determine the spectral properties of G326.3$-$1.8 and understand its\nnature. The centroid of the $\\gamma$-ray emission evolves with energy and is\nspatially coincident with the radio PWN at high energies (E $>$ 3 GeV). The\nmorphological analysis reveals that a model considering two contributions from\nthe SNR and the PWN reproduces the $\\gamma$-ray data better than a\nsingle-component model. The associated spectral analysis using power laws shows\ntwo distinct spectral features, a softer spectrum for the remnant ($\\Gamma$ =\n2.17 $\\pm$ 0.06) and a harder spectrum for the PWN ($\\Gamma$ = 1.79 $\\pm$\n0.12), consistent with hadronic and leptonic origin for the SNR and the PWN\nrespectively. Focusing on the SNR spectrum, we use one-zone models to derive\nsome physical properties and, in particular, we find that the emission is best\nexplained with a hadronic scenario in which the large target density is\nprovided by radiative shocks in HI clouds struck by the SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 20:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Experiments on a real dataset show the effectiveness of FairGAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 23:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

However, the most popular LF\nrepresentations are images from multiple views. Multi-view image-based\nrepresentations generally need to restrict the range or degrees of freedom of\nthe viewing experience to what can be interpolated in the image domain,\nessentially because they lack explicit geometry information. We present a new\nsurface light field (SLF) representation based on explicit geometry, and a\nmethod for SLF compression. First, we map the multi-view images of a scene onto\na 3D geometric point cloud. The color of each point in the point cloud is a\nfunction of viewing direction known as a view map. We represent each view map\nefficiently in a B-Spline wavelet basis. This representation is capable of\nmodeling diverse surface materials and complex lighting conditions in a highly\nscalable and adaptive manner. The coefficients of the B-Spline wavelet\nrepresentation are then compressed spatially. To increase the spatial\ncorrelation and thus improve compression efficiency, we introduce a smoothing\nterm to make the coefficients more similar across the 3D space. We compress the\ncoefficients spatially using existing point cloud compression (PCC) methods. On\nthe decoder side, the scene is rendered efficiently from any viewing direction\nby reconstructing the view map at each point. In contrast to multi-view\nimage-based LF approaches, our method supports photo-realistic rendering of\nreal-world scenes from arbitrary viewpoints, i.e., with an unlimited six\ndegrees of freedom (6DOF). In terms of rate and distortion, experimental\nresults show that our method achieves superior performance with lighter decoder\ncomplexity compared with a reference image-plus-geometry compression (IGC)\nscheme, indicating its potential in practical virtual and augmented reality\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 00:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

The method is based on Gaussian\nMixture Variational Autoencoder, which can learn feature representations of the\nnormal samples as a Gaussian Mixture Model trained using deep learning. A Fully\nConvolutional Network (FCN) that does not contain a fully-connected layer is\nemployed for the encoder-decoder structure to preserve relative spatial\ncoordinates between the input image and the output feature map.

We study the effectiveness of the\nnear-optimal cost-to-go oracle on the planning horizon and demonstrate that the\ncost-to-go oracle shortens the learner's planning horizon as function of its\naccuracy: a globally optimal oracle can shorten the planning horizon to one,\nleading to a one-step greedy Markov Decision Process which is much easier to\noptimize, while an oracle that is far away from the optimality requires\nplanning over a longer horizon to achieve near-optimal performance. Hence our\nnew insight bridges the gap and interpolates between imitation learning and\nreinforcement learning. Motivated by the above mentioned insights, we propose\nTruncated HORizon Policy Search (THOR), a method that focuses on searching for\npolicies that maximize the total reshaped reward over a finite planning horizon\nwhen the oracle is sub-optimal. We experimentally demonstrate that a\ngradient-based implementation of THOR can achieve superior performance compared\nto RL baselines and IL baselines even when the oracle is sub-optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 04:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

The problem is tackled by developing methods\nfor linearising stochastic differential equations with respect to an arbitrary\nGaussian process. Two methods are developed based on 1) taking the limit of\nstatistical linear regression of the discretised process and 2) minimising an\nupper bound to a cost functional. Their difference is manifested in the\ndiffusion of the approximate processes. This in turn gives novel derivations of\npre-existing Gaussian smoothers when Method 1 is used and a new class of\nGaussian smoothers when Method 2 is used. Furthermore, based on the\naforementioned development the iterative Gaussian smoothers in discrete-time\nare generalised to the continuous-time setting by iteratively re-linearising\nthe stochastic differential equation with respect to the current Gaussian\nprocess approximation to the smoothed process. The method is verified in two\nchallenging tracking problems, a reentry problem and a radar tracked\ncoordinated turn model with state dependent diffusion.

This has\ngenerally been taken as evidence of an additional spin-down torque operating in\nthese systems and it has been suggested that gravitational wave torques may be\noperating and be linked to a potentially observable signal. In this paper we\naim to determine whether additional spin-down torques are necessary, or whether\nthe observed limit of $f\\approx 700$ Hz could correspond to the mass-shedding\nfrequency for the observed systems and is simply a consequence of the,\ncurrently unknown, state of matter at high densities. Given our ignorance with\nregard to the true equation of state of matter above nuclear saturation\ndensities, we make minimal physical assumption and only demand causality in the\ncore. We then connect our causally-limited equation of state to a realistic\nmicrophysical crustal equation of state for densities below nuclear saturation\ndensity. This produces a limiting model that will give the lowest possible\nmaximum frequency, which we compare to observational constraints on neutron\nstar masses and frequencies. We also compare our findings with the constraints\non the tidal deformability obtained in the observations of the GW170817 event.\nWe find that the lack of pulsars spinning faster than $f\\approx 700$ Hz is not\ncompatible with our causal limited `minimal' equation of state, for which the\nbreakup frequency cannot be lower than $f_{\\rm max}\\approx 1200$ Hz. A low\nfrequency cutoff, around $f\\approx 800$ Hz could only be possible if we assume\nthat these systems do not contain neutron stars with masses above $M\\approx 2\nM_\\odot$. This would have to be due either to selection effects, or possibly to\na phase transition in the interior of the neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 07:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The neural network is termed CocoNet, i.e. coordinates-to-color\nnetwork. During the training process, the neural network learns to encode the\ninput image within its layers. More specifically, the network learns a\ncontinuous function that approximates the discrete RGB values sampled over the\ndiscrete 2D pixel locations. At test time, given a 2D pixel coordinate, the\nneural network will output the approximate RGB values of the corresponding\npixel. By considering every 2D pixel location, the network can actually\nreconstruct the entire learned image. It is important to note that we have to\ntrain an individual neural network for each input image, i.e. one network\nencodes a single image only. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\npropose a neural approach for encoding images individually, by learning a\nmapping from the 2D pixel coordinate space to the RGB color space.

We\nanalyse the influence of the dimensionless numbers and especially the distance\nbetween bubbles and the P\\'eclet number, Pe, which we vary among eight decades\nand identify five different dissolution regimes. We show different\nconcentration patterns and the dependence of the Sherwood numbers, Sh. These\nregimes can be classified by either the importance of the streamline diffusion\nor by the interaction between bubbles. For small Pe the streamline diffusion is\nnot negligible as compared to convection whereas for large Pe, convection\ndominates in the streamline direction and, thus, crosswind diffusion becomes\ncrucial in governing the dissolution through boundary layers or of the\nremaining wake behind the bubbles. Bubbles interaction takes place for very\nsmall Pe for which the dissolution is purely diffusive or for very large Pe\nnumbers in which case long wakes eventually reach the following bubble. We also\nobserve that the bubble deformability mainly affects the Sh in the regime for\nvery large Pe in which bubbles interaction matters, and also that the rigid\ninterface effect affects the boundary layer and the remaining wake. The effect\nof off-centred position of the bubble, determined by the transverse force\nbalance, is also limited to large Pe. The boundary layers in rigid bubble\nsurfaces are thicker as compared to those on stress-free bubble surface and,\nthus, the dissolution is smaller.

The models have to be\ncalibrated on experimental data to present correct behavioural features. This\ncalibration is essential to enhance the social integration of the robot into\nthe group. When calibrated, the behavioural model of fish behaviour is\nimplemented to drive a robot with closed-loop control of social interactions\ninto a group of zebrafish. This approach can be useful to form mixed-groups,\nand study animal individual and collective behaviour by using biomimetic\nautonomous robots capable of responding to the animals in long-standing\nexperiments. Here, we show a methodology for continuous real-time calibration\nand refinement of multi-level behavioural model. The real-time calibration, by\nan evolutionary algorithm, is based on simulation of the model to correspond to\nthe observed fish behaviour in real-time. The calibrated model is updated on\nthe robot and tested during the experiments. This method allows to cope with\nchanges of dynamics in fish behaviour. Moreover, each fish presents individual\nbehavioural differences. Thus, each trial is done with naive fish groups that\ndisplay behavioural variability. This real-time calibration methodology can\noptimise the robot behaviours during the experiments. Our implementation of\nthis methodology runs on three different computers that perform individual\ntracking, data-analysis, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, simulation of\nthe fish robot and adaptation of the robot behavioural models, all in\nreal-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 11:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

To realize this, we adapted some techniques from the constraint\nprogramming community and we have extended them in order to cope with\nmultidimensional examples. The method uses a tensor representation of the\nexample, which helps in capturing the dimensionality as well as the structure\nof the example, and applies tensor operations to find the constraints that are\nsatisfied by the example. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we used\nconstraints from the Nurse Rostering Competition and generated solutions that\nsatisfy these constraints; these solutions were then used as examples to learn\nconstraints.

This tensor is the crux for the construction of the desired\ndivergence equation, which allows us to conclude the uniqueness of the\nSchwarzschild black hole without using Smarr's integration mass formula. In\nEinstein-Maxwell(-dilaton) theory, we apply the maximal principle for a number\nof divergence equations to prove the uniqueness theorem of static black holes.\nIn higher $(n\\ge 5)$ dimensional vacuum spacetimes, a central obstruction for\napplicability of the current proof is the integration of the\n$(n-2)$-dimensional scalar curvature over the horizon cross-section, which has\nbeen evaluated to be a topological constant by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for\n$n=4$.

Hyperledger Fabric is one such permissioned blockchain platform\nand one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation. The Fabric\ncomprises various components such as smart-contracts, endorsers, committers,\nvalidators, and orderers. As the performance of blockchain platform is a major\nconcern for enterprise applications, in this work, we perform a comprehensive\nempirical study to characterize the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and\nidentify potential performance bottlenecks to gain a better understanding of\nthe system.

In addition, we also aim to identify performance bottlenecks\nand hotspots.

In the\nsecond phase, we focus on optimizing Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 based on our\nobservations. We introduced and studied various simple optimizations such as\naggressive caching for endorsement policy verification in the cryptography\ncomponent (3x improvement in the performance) and parallelizing endorsement\npolicy verification (7x improvement). Further, we enhanced and measured the\neffect of an existing bulk read/write optimization for CouchDB during state\nvalidation & commit phase (2.5x improvement).

However, it is still a big challenge to deploy these\ndeep models on resource-constrained embedded devices such as mobile robots,\nsmart phones and so on. Therefore, network compression for such platforms is a\nreasonable solution to reduce memory consumption and computation complexity. In\nthis paper, a novel channel pruning method based on genetic algorithm is\nproposed to compress very deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Firstly, a\npre-trained CNN model is pruned layer by layer according to the sensitivity of\neach layer. After that, the pruned model is fine-tuned based on knowledge\ndistillation framework. These two improvements significantly decrease the model\nredundancy with less accuracy drop. Channel selection is a combinatorial\noptimization problem that has exponential solution space. In order to\naccelerate the selection process, the proposed method formulates it as a search\nproblem, which can be solved efficiently by genetic algorithm. Meanwhile, a\ntwo-step approximation fitness function is designed to further improve the\nefficiency of genetic process. The proposed method has been verified on three\nbenchmark datasets with two popular CNN models: VGGNet and ResNet. On the\nCIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, our approach outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art methods. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, the pruned VGGNet\nachieves better performance than the original model with 8 times parameters\ncompression and 3 times FLOPs reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 12:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

The second functional\ntolerance bounds utilize functional Principal Component Analysis to construct a\ntolerance factor. This work is motivated by two main applications: process\ncontrol and disease monitoring. The problem of statistical analysis and\nmodeling of functional data in process control is important in determining when\na production has moved beyond a baseline.

This is exemplified by the multiple and\ndiscordant interpretations of Landau damping still present after seventy years.\nFor long deemed impossible, the mechanical N-body description of this damping,\nnot only enables its rigorous and simple calculation, but makes unequivocal and\nintuitive its interpretation as the synchronization of almost resonant passing\nparticles. This synchronization justifies mechanically why a single formula\napplies to both Landau growth and damping. As to the electrostatic potential,\nthe phase mixing of many beam modes produces Landau damping, but it is\nunexpectedly essential for Landau growth too. Moreover, collisions play an\nessential role in collisionless plasmas. In particular, Debye shielding results\nfrom a cooperative dynamical self-organization process, where \"collisional\"\ndeflections due to a given electron diminish the apparent number of charges\nabout it. The finite value of exponentiation rates due to collisions is crucial\nfor the equivalent of the van Kampen phase mixing to occur in the N-body\nsystem. The N-body approach incorporates spontaneous emission naturally, whose\ncompound effect with Landau damping drives a thermalization of Langmuir waves.\nO'Neil's damping with trapping typical of initially large enough Langmuir waves\nresults from a phase transition. As to collisional transport, there is a smooth\nconnection between impact parameters where the two-body Rutherford picture is\ncorrect, and those where a collective description is mandatory.

Numerical methods based on Jacobi fields or\ngeodesics parallelograms are currently used in geometric data processing. In\nthis last class, pole ladder is a simplification of Schild's ladder for the\nparallel transport along geodesics that was shown to be particularly simple and\nnumerically stable in Lie groups. So far, these methods were shown to be first\norder approximations of the Riemannian parallel transport, but higher order\nerror terms are difficult to establish. In this paper, we build on a BCH-type\nformula on affine connection spaces to establish the behavior of one pole\nladder step up to order 5. It is remarkable that the scheme is of order three\nin general affine connection spaces with a symmetric connection, much higher\nthan expected. Moreover, the fourth-order term involves the covariant\nderivative of the curvature only, which is vanishing in locally symmetric\nspace. We show that pole ladder is actually locally exact in these spaces, and\neven almost surely globally exact in Riemannian symmetric manifolds. These\nproperties make pole ladder a very attractive alternative to other methods in\ngeneral affine manifolds with a symmetric connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 13:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-30"}

Such\ntransitions can be observed in various bacterial cells, in nerves, in cancer\ncells, but also in lung surfactant. It seems as if the presence of transitions\nslightly below physiological temperature is a generic property of most cells.\nThey are important because they influence many physical properties of the\nmembranes. At the transition temperature, membranes display a larger\npermeability that is accompanied by ion-channel-like phenomena even in the\ncomplete absence of proteins. Membranes are softer, which implies that\nphenomena such as endocytosis and exocytosis are facilitated. Mechanical signal\npropagation phenomena related to nerve pulses are strongly enhanced. The\nposition of transitions can be affected by changes in temperature, pressure, pH\nand salt concentration or by the presence of anesthetics. Thus, even at\nphysiological temperature, these transitions are of relevance. There position\nand thereby the physical properties of the membrane can be controlled by\nchanges in the intensive thermodynamic variables. Here, we review some of the\nexperimental findings and the thermodynamics that describes the control of the\nmembrane function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 13:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

Furthermore, under stronger conditions, we derive detailed\nasymptotic properties for the popular $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$nn), support\nvector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers.

In this paper we study versions of\nthis for an infinite group G, with the degree of nilpotence defined by sampling\nG in various natural ways, such as with a random walk, or with a Folner\nsequence if G is amenable. In our first main result we show that if G is\nfinitely generated then the degree of k-step nilpotence is positive if and only\nif G is virtually k-step nilpotent. This generalises both an earlier result of\nthe second author treating the case k=1 and a result of Shalev for finite\ngroups, and uses techniques from both of these earlier results. We also show,\nusing the notion of polynomial mappings of groups developed by Leibman and\nothers, that to a large extent the degree of nilpotence does not depend on the\nmethod of sampling. As part of our argument we generalise a result of Leibman\nby showing that if f is a polynomial mapping into a torsion-free nilpotent\ngroup then the set of roots of f is sparse in a certain sense. In our second\nmain result we consider the case where G is residually finite but not\nnecessarily finitely generated. Here we show that if the degree of k-step\nnilpotence of the finite quotients of G is uniformly bounded from below then G\nis virtually k-step nilpotent, answering a question of Shalev. As part of our\nproof we show that degree of nilpotence of finite groups is sub-multiplicative\nwith respect to quotients, generalising a result of Gallagher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 14:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 07:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 08:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 11:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 20:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 09:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

One consequence\nis the observation of quantum recurrences in systems with thousand of\ninteracting particles. The relaxation observed in 1D superfluids is universal\nfor a large class of many-body systems, those where the relevant physics can be\ndescribed by a set of 'long lived' collective modes.

The dependence of chemical shifts on local\natomic environments sets them among the most powerful tools for structure\nelucidation of powdered solids or amorphous materials. Unfortunately, this\ndependency comes with the cost of high accuracy first-principle calculations to\nqualitatively predict chemical shifts in solids. Machine learning methods have\nrecently emerged as a way to overcome the need for explicit high accuracy\nfirst-principle calculations. However, the vast chemical and combinatorial\nspace spanned by molecular solids, together with the strong dependency of\nchemical shifts of atoms on their environment, poses a huge challenge for any\nmachine learning method.

As shown in previous works, dyadic\nassociations are stronger between individuals with similar age and dominance\nrank. This study reveals that the relative stability of dyadic spatial\nrelationships between changes in group composition or enclosure is due to the\nidentities of transferred individuals more than the quantity of individuals\nthat are transferred. Older cattle had higher network centralities than other\nindividuals. The centrality of individuals was also affected by their sex and\nthe number of familiar individuals in the group.

This task is performed by adding a suitable periodic perturbation\n$F_j$ on a Ratchet mapping and the procedure consists in multiplying a\nparticular class of generic Isoperiodic Stable Structures (ISSs), since the\nexistence of non-zero RCs is directly related to the occurrence of stable\ndomains. By proliferating the ISSs, it is possible to: (i) postpone thermal\neffects that usually increase the chaotic domain and (ii) demonstrate, by using\na quantitative analysis, that the area which provides optimal RCs in the\ntwo-dimensional parameter space can be enlarged about $78\\%$. In addition, for\nsome specific parameter combinations, non-zero RCs can be induced through the\nbirth of a new attractor, which moves away as the strength of $F_j$ increases.\nClearly, the methodology applied to the ratchet mapping is an efficient way to\ndeal with unavoidable thermal effects and its consequent undesirable dynamics,\nspecially in experimental setups. As a second general remark, we conclude that\nour main findings can be extended to issues related to transport problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 14:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

The way to to achieve such integration in a changing and\nunpredictable world is to support the close interaction between the world of\nsocietal expectations and the world of technology. Policy Scan and Technology\nStrategy design methodology presented in this paper was developed precisely for\nthe purpose of addressing specific types of 'ill-defined' problems in terms of\nobserving, analyzing and integrating technology developments and availabilities\nwith policy requirements, social governance and societal expectations. The\nmethodology consists of conceptual tools and methods for developing concrete\nactions and products for guiding technology adoption for social change. It is\ngeared towards increasingly complex and uncertain situations where existing\nanalysis and problem solving methods often fail due to many non-linearities\ninherent in the social and technology worlds and, especially, at their area of\ntheir inter intersection. The development of the methodology followed the\ngrounded theory construction process which requires a close relation to a\nspecific context of an application domain, determined by actual interaction\nbetween the worlds of societal problems and technology. The chosen application\ndomain of this research is the intersection of smart mobility problematics and\nopportunities, the rising autonomous driving technology, data privacy,\nprovenance and security challenges, policies and legislation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 17:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}
