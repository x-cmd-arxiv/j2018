While the actual role of nesting has been under\ndebate, it is well understood that the microscopic interaction responsible for\nthe CDWs is the electron-phonon coupling. The case of TiSe$_2$ is however\nunique in this family in that the normal state above the critical temperature\n$T_\\mathrm{CDW}$ is characterized by a small quasiparticle bandgap as measured\nby ARPES, so that no nesting-derived enhancement of the susceptibility is\npresent.

On the other hand, it has also been suggested\nthat the whole phase diagram can be explained by a sufficiently strong\nelectron-phonon coupling. In this work, in order to estimate how close this\nmaterial is to the pure excitonic insulator instability, we quantify the\nstrength of electron-hole interactions by computing the exciton band structure\nat the level of hybrid density functional theory, focusing on the monolayer.

The empirical\nresults show an unstable link between inflation and monetary growth in Ghana,\nwhile the final state coefficient of inflation elasticity to money growth is\npositive but statistically insignificant.

Finally, we apply our results to\nconstruct new examples of non-decomposable positive maps, and establish a\nconnection to the PPT squared conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 16:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 23:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Our first aim is to\nlearn features that distinguish between the interictal and preictal regions.\nThe second aim is to define a prediction horizon in which the prediction is as\naccurate and as early as possible, clearly two competing objectives. Methods:\nConvolutional filters on the wavelet transformation of the EEG signal are used\nto define and learn quantitative signatures for each period: interictal,\npreictal, and ictal. The optimal seizure prediction horizon is also learned\nfrom the data as opposed to making an a priori assumption. Results:\nComputational solutions to the optimization problem indicate a ten-minute\nseizure prediction horizon. This result is verified by measuring\nKullback-Leibler divergence on the distributions of the automatically extracted\nfeatures. Conclusion: The results on the EEG database of 204 recordings\ndemonstrate that (i) the preictal phase transition occurs approximately ten\nminutes before seizure onset, and (ii) the prediction results on the test set\nare promising, with a sensitivity of 87.8% and a low false prediction rate of\n0.142 FP/h. Our results significantly outperform a random predictor and other\nseizure prediction algorithms.

The initial sky\nlocalization of the source of the gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, allowed\nelectromagnetic observatories to identify NGC 4993 as the host galaxy. In this\nwork, we improve initial estimates of the binary's properties, including\ncomponent masses, spins, and tidal parameters, using the known source location,\nimproved modeling, and recalibrated Virgo data. We extend the range of\ngravitational-wave frequencies considered down to 23 Hz, compared to 30 Hz in\nthe initial analysis. We also compare results inferred using several signal\nmodels, which are more accurate and incorporate additional physical effects as\ncompared to the initial analysis. We improve the localization of the\ngravitational-wave source to a 90% credible region of $16~\\mathrm{deg}^2$. We\nfind tighter constraints on the masses, spins, and tidal parameters, and\ncontinue to find no evidence for nonzero component spins. The component masses\nare inferred to lie between 1.00 and 1.89 $M_\\odot$ when allowing for large\ncomponent spins, and to lie between 1.16 and 1.60 $M_\\odot$ (with a total mass\n$2.73^{+0.04}_{-0.01} \\, M_\\odot$) when the spins are restricted to be within\nthe range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Under minimal assumptions\nabout the nature of the compact objects, our constraints for the tidal\ndeformability parameter $\\tilde \\Lambda$ are $(0,630)$ when we allow for large\ncomponent spins, and $300^{+420}_{-230}$ (using a 90% highest posterior density\ninterval) when restricting the magnitude of the component spins, ruling out\nseveral equation-of-state models at the 90% credible level. Finally, with LIGO\nand GEO600 data, we use a Bayesian analysis to place upper limits on the\namplitude and spectral energy density of a possible post-merger signal.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 16:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 18:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 19:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a\nnovel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme\nconditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial,\nminimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on\nthe tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to\nconstraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by\nworking under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are\ndescribed by the same equation of state and have spins within the range\nobserved in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods:\nthe use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic\nproperties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of\nthe defining function $p(\\rho)$ of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO\nand Virgo data alone and the first method, we measure the two neutron star\nradii as $R_1=10.8^{+2.0}_{-1.7}$ km for the heavier star and $R_2=\n10.7^{+2.1}_{-1.5}$ km for the lighter star at the 90% credible level. If we\nadditionally require that the equation of state supports neutron stars with\nmasses larger than $1.97 \\,M_\\odot$ as required from electromagnetic\nobservations and employ the equation-of-state parametrization, we further\nconstrain $R_1= 11.9^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ km and $R_2= 11.9^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ km at the\n90% credible level. Finally, we obtain constraints on $p(\\rho)$ at supranuclear\ndensities, with pressure at twice nuclear saturation density measured at\n$3.5^{+2.7}_{-1.7}\\times 10^{34} \\,\\mathrm{dyn}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ at the 90%\nlevel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 16:56:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 17:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

A similar quantized thermal Hall effect is expected\nin chiral topological superconductors. The unavoidable presence of gapless\nacoustic phonons, however, implies that, in contrast to the quantized\nelectrical conductivity, the thermal Hall conductivity $\\kappa_xy$ is never\nexactly quantized in real materials. Here, we investigate how phonons affect\nthe quantization of the thermal conductivity focusing on the edge theory. As an\nexample we consider a Kitaev spin liquid gapped by an external magnetic field\ncoupled to acoustic phonons. The coupling to phonons destroys the ballistic\nthermal transport of the edge mode completely, as energy can leak into the\nbulk, thus drastically modifying the edge-picture of the thermal Hall effect.\nNevertheless, the thermal Hall conductivity remains approximately quantized and\nwe argue, that the coupling to phonons to the edge mode is a necessary\ncondition for the observation of the quantized thermal Hall effect. The\nstrength of this edge coupling does, however, not affect the conductivity. We\nargue that for sufficiently clean systems the leading correction to the\nquantized thermal Hall effect, $\\Delta \\kappa_{xy}/T \\sim \\text{sign(B)} \\,\nT^2$, arises from a intrinsic anomalous Hall effect of the acoustic phonons due\nto Berry phases imprinted by the chiral (spin) liquid in the bulk.

There is a unique\ncompatible Weyl connection for the conformal structure, and it leads to the\nconstruction of a conformally covariant GHP formalism and a generalization of\nit to weighted spinor/tensor fiber bundles.

However, in games played on finite graphs\nwith quantitative objectives (as used for reactive synthesis), this is not the\ncase.\n  We consider increasing chains of strategies instead to recover a satisfactory\nrationality notion based on dominance in such games. We start with some\norder-theoretic considerations establishing sufficient criteria for this to\nwork. We then turn our attention to generalised safety/reachability games as a\nparticular application. We propose the notion of maximal uniform chain as the\ndesired dominance-based rationality concept in these games.

Using\nthis code, we find that, in general, the bias induced by light relics partially\ncompensates the suppression of power, and should be accounted for in any search\nfor relics with galaxy data. In particular, for the case of neutrinos, we find\nthat both the normal and inverted hierarchies present a percent-level step in\nthe Lagrangian bias, with a size scaling linearly with the neutrino-mass sum,\nin agreement with recent simulations.

In our work, we connect these cornerstones to\nshed light on the route to equilibrium for a class of properly prepared states.\nWe unveil that, if the off-diagonal part of the ETH applies, then the\nrelaxation process can become independent of whether or not a state is close to\nequilibrium. Moreover, in this case, the dynamics is generated by a single\ncorrelation function, i.e., the relaxation function in the context of LRT.

The major drawback of existing black-box\nattacks is the need for excessive model queries, which may give a false sense\nof model robustness due to inefficient query designs. To bridge this gap, we\npropose a generic framework for query-efficient black-box attacks. Our\nframework, AutoZOOM, which is short for Autoencoder-based Zeroth Order\nOptimization Method, has two novel building blocks towards efficient black-box\nattacks: (i) an adaptive random gradient estimation strategy to balance query\ncounts and distortion, and (ii) an autoencoder that is either trained offline\nwith unlabeled data or a bilinear resizing operation for attack acceleration.\nExperimental results suggest that, by applying AutoZOOM to a state-of-the-art\nblack-box attack (ZOO), a significant reduction in model queries can be\nachieved without sacrificing the attack success rate and the visual quality of\nthe resulting adversarial examples. In particular, when compared to the\nstandard ZOO method, AutoZOOM can consistently reduce the mean query counts in\nfinding successful adversarial examples (or reaching the same distortion level)\nby at least 93% on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, leading to novel\ninsights on adversarial robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 01:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 21:03:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 22:26:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 00:41:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 11:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

For example, the deep convolutional architecture Inception-v4 uses\nReLU. To improve the classification performance of traditional CNNs, a new\n\"Multi-function Convolutional Neural Network\" (MCNN) is created by using\ndifferent activation functions for different neurons. For $n$ neurons and $m$\ndifferent activation functions, there are a total of $m^n-m$ MCNNs and only $m$\ntraditional CNNs. Therefore, the best model is very likely to be chosen from\nMCNNs because there are $m^n-2m$ more MCNNs than traditional CNNs. For\nperformance analysis, two different datasets for two applications (classifying\nhandwritten digits from the MNIST database and classifying brain MRI images\ninto one of the four stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)) are used.

Researchers have increased LSTM depth by stacking LSTM cells to\nimprove performance. This incurs model redundancy, increases run-time delay,\nand makes the LSTMs more prone to overfitting. To address these problems, we\npropose a hidden-layer LSTM (H-LSTM) that adds hidden layers to LSTM's original\none level non-linear control gates. H-LSTM increases accuracy while employing\nfewer external stacked layers, thus reducing the number of parameters and\nrun-time latency significantly. We employ grow-and-prune (GP) training to\niteratively adjust the hidden layers through gradient-based growth and\nmagnitude-based pruning of connections. This learns both the weights and the\ncompact architecture of H-LSTM control gates. We have GP-trained H-LSTMs for\nimage captioning and speech recognition applications.

The interaction of predator and prey is described by the\nVariable Territory (VT) model with Allee effects in an Ordinary Differential\nEquation (ODE) framework. Climate influence is modeled in this ODE framework as\nan exogenous driver which affects the prey growth rate. Mathematically, this\nexogenous driver is a function of time, the climate function, that describes\nhow favorable is the climate, on a scale from $-1$ to $+1$. Climate change has\na number of effects; in this work, we focus on changes in climate variability,\nin particular, a decrease in the switching rate between good years and bad.\nWith regard to the predator-prey populations, we focus on the conditions that\nlead to extinction. We developed a high performance software tool to allow the\nsystematic exploration of a wide range of climate scenarios at a high level of\ndetail. Our results show that the predator-prey system is sensitive to the\nrapid drop in growth rate that accompanies a switch from good growth years to\nbad growth years. The amplitude of this negative variation as well as its\nduration are key factors, but more importantly, it is the moment when this\nnegative change occurs during the predator-prey cycle that is critical for the\nsurvival of the species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 05:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

This study sought\nto identify the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making by pedestrians\nwho follow another person across the road at the green or at the red light in\ntwo different countries (France and Japan). We used agent-based modelling to\nsimulate the road-crossing behaviours of pedestrians.

We found that two\nprocesses suffice to simulate pedestrian behaviours. Importantly, the study\nrevealed differences between the two nationalities and between sexes in the\ndecision to follow and cross at the green and at the red light. Japanese\npedestrians are particularly attentive to the number of already departed\npedestrians and the number of waiting pedestrians at the red light, whilst\ntheir French counterparts only consider the number of pedestrians that have\nalready stepped off the kerb, thus showing the strong conformism of Japanese\npeople.

The\npublic information which is generated by the financial assets, and a larger\nflow of information that contains additional knowledge about a death time of an\ninsured.

The on/off status of loads are\ndetermined in the first phase to maximize survivability, while the\nfunctionality of supplying loads are maximized in the second phase. Based on a\ncomprehensive model of a DC shipboard power systems (DC-SPS), the two-phase\nmethod renders two mixed-integer non-convex problems. To make the problems\ntractable, we develop second-order-cone-based convex relaxations, thus\nconverting the problems into mixed-integer convex problems.

In this work, the effect\nof the porosity and permeability on the wake patterns of porous rectangular\ncylinders is numerically investigated at low to moderate Reynolds numbers in\nthe framework of direct numerical simulation combined with local and global\nstability analyses. A modified Darcy-Brinkman formulation is employed here so\nas to describe the flow behavior inside the porous media, where also the\nconvective terms are retained to correctly account for the inertial effects at\nhigh values of permeability. Different aspect ratios of the cylinder are\nconsidered, varying the thickness-to-height ratios, t/d, from 0.01 (flat plate)\nto 1.0 (square cylinder). The results show that the permeability of the bodies\nhas a strong effect in modifying the characteristics of the wakes and of the\nassociated flow instabilities, while the porosity weakly affects the resulting\nflow patterns. In particular, the fluid flows through the porous bodies and,\nthus, as the permeability is progressively increased, the recirculation\nregions, initially attached to the rear part of the bodies, at first detach\nfrom the body and, eventually, disappear even in the near wakes. Global\nstability analyses lead to the identification of critical values of the\npermeability above which any linear instability is prevented.

This polarization feature is\ngenerally believed to be due to an inner aspherical core revealed in the late\nphase, while this polarization feature can also be contributed by the effect of\npolarized-scattered echoes by circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN. In this\npaper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN\nejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence\nof the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and\namounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has\ncharacteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase\nwith higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due\nto the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical\ndepth of dust in shorter wavelengths. Except for the $U$ band, the polarization\nincreases after the plateau phase, and the polarization degree is generally\nhigher for shorter wavelengths. These polarimetric features can be easily\ndistinguished from the polarization expected from an aspherical core, which\npredicts almost no wavelength dependence. Moreover, we show that multi-band\npolarimetric observations for SNe IIP can constrain a parameter space in the CS\ndust mass and distance from the SNe. We thus encourage multi-band polarimetric\nobservations for SNe IIP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 08:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

While the evolution\nis in general intractable in all its details, relevant observables can become\ninsensitive to microscopic system parameters and initial conditions. This is\nthe basis of the phenomenon of universality. Far from equilibrium, universality\nis identified through the scaling of the spatiotemporal evolution of the\nsystem, captured by universal exponents and functions. Theoretically, this has\nbeen studied in examples as different as the reheating process in inflationary\nuniverse cosmology, the dynamics of nuclear collision experiments described by\nquantum chromodynamics, or the post-quench dynamics in dilute quantum gases in\nnon-relativistic quantum field theory. Here we observe the emergence of\nuniversal dynamics by evaluating spatially resolved spin correlations in a\nquasi one-dimensional spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. For long evolution times\nwe extract the scaling properties from the spatial correlations of the spin\nexcitations. From this we find the dynamics to be governed by transport of an\nemergent conserved quantity towards low momentum scales. Our results establish\nan important class of non-stationary systems whose dynamics is encoded in time\nindependent scaling exponents and functions signaling the existence of\nnon-thermal fixed points. We confirm that the non-thermal scaling phenomenon\ninvolves no fine-tuning, by preparing different initial conditions and\nobserving the same scaling behaviour. Our analog quantum simulation approach\nprovides the basis to reveal the underlying mechanisms and characteristics of\nnon-thermal universality classes. One may use this universality to learn, from\nexperiments with ultra-cold gases, about fundamental aspects of dynamics\nstudied in cosmology and quantum chromodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 09:52:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 11:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

The situation leaves developers with no\nportable solution to incorporate protection for the sensitive application\ncomponent.\n  We propose LOTRx86, a fundamental and portable approach for user space\nprivilege separation.

The arising HT-AWGM is adaptive both in the wavelet representation of\nthe low dimensional factors and in the tensor rank of the HT representation.\nThe point of departure is an adaptive wavelet method for the HT format using\napproximate Richardson iterations from [1] and an AWGM method as described in\n[13]. HT-AWGM performs a sequence of Galerkin solves based upon a truncated\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm from [33] in combination with\na tensor-based preconditioner from [3].

In\nthis article, we outline the path that led us to support the hypothesis that\nour physical reality is fundamentally conceptual-like and cognitivistic-like.\nHowever, contrary to the 'abstract ego hypothesis' introduced by John von\nNeumann and further explored, in more recent times, by Henry Stapp, our\napproach does not rely on the measurement problem as expressing a possible 'gap\nin physical causation', which would point to a reality lying beyond the\nmind-matter distinction. On the contrary, in our approach the measurement\nproblem is considered to be essentially solved, at least for what concerns the\norigin of quantum probabilities, which we have reasons to believe they would be\nepistemic. Our conclusion that conceptuality and cognition would be an integral\npart of all physical processes comes instead from the observation of the\nstriking similarities between the non-spatial behavior of the quantum\nmicro-physical entities and that of the human concepts. This gave birth to a\nnew interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the 'conceptualistic\ninterpretation', currently under investigation within our group in Brussels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 18:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

We\nknow how to describe quantum optics of ring resonators, and the resulting\ndescription agrees with experiment. We can apply the same formal strategy to\nany looped quantum evolution, in particular to the time travel. The argument is\nin its essence a topological one and thus does not refer to any concrete\ngeometry. It is shown that the resulting paradigm automatically removes logical\ninconsistencies associated with chronology protection, provided all\ninput-output relations are given by unitary maps. Examples of elementary loops\nand a two-loop time machine illustrate the construction. In order to apply the\nformalism to quantum computation one has to describe multi-qubit systems\ninteracting via CTC-based quantum gates. This is achieved by second\nquantization of loops.

Channel gating identifies regions in the\nfeatures that contribute less to the classification result, and skips the\ncomputation on a subset of the input channels for these ineffective regions.\nUnlike static network pruning, channel gating optimizes CNN inference at\nrun-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics, which allows\nsubstantially reducing the compute cost with almost no accuracy loss. We\nexperimentally show that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks\nachieves 2.7-8.0$\\times$ reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and\n2.0-4.4$\\times$ reduction in off-chip memory accesses with a minimal accuracy\nloss on CIFAR-10. Combining our method with knowledge distillation reduces the\ncompute cost of ResNet-18 by 2.6$\\times$ without accuracy drop on ImageNet. We\nfurther demonstrate that channel gating can be realized in hardware\nefficiently. Our approach exhibits sparsity patterns that are well-suited to\ndense systolic arrays with minimal additional hardware. We have designed an\naccelerator for channel gating networks, which can be implemented using either\nFPGAs or ASICs. Running a quantized ResNet-18 model for ImageNet, our\naccelerator achieves an encouraging speedup of 2.4$\\times$ on average, with a\ntheoretical FLOP reduction of 2.8$\\times$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 20:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 23:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

This new technique has\nintroduced two important advantages over the more standard finite\ndifference/element methods: 1) it reduces the amount of memory required for the\nsimulation of a quantum system. As a matter of fact, it does not require\nstoring the kernel in a (expensive) multi-dimensional array, and 2) a\nconsistent speedup is obtained since now one can compute the kernel on the\ncells of interest only, i.e. the cells occupied by signed particles. Although\nthis certainly represents a step forward into the direction of rapid\nsimulations of quantum systems, it comes at a price: the number of hidden\nneurons is constrained by design to be equal to the number of cells of the\ndiscretized real space. It is easy to see how this limitation can quickly\nbecome an issue when very fine meshes are necessary. In this work, we continue\nto ameliorate this previous approach by reducing the complexity of the neural\nnetwork and, consequently, by introducing an additional speedup. More\nspecifically, we propose a new network architecture which requires less neurons\nthan the previous approach in its hidden layer. For validation purposes, we\napply this novel technique to a well known simple, but very indicative,\none-dimensional quantum system consisting of a Gaussian wave packet interacting\nwith a potential barrier. In order to clearly show the validity of our\nsuggested approach, time-dependent comparisons with the previous technique are\npresented. In spite of its simpler architecture, a good agreement is observed,\nthus representing one step further towards fast and reliable simulations of\ntime-dependent quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 18:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

Our hypotheses were that: a) three\nto six years-old children think about robots as human-like entities, concerning\nto both the physical and the conceptual nature of human beings, and b) they do\nnot understand the concept of the software programming behind the operation of\na robot. The study is based on two different data collection systems: an\nindividual-based system and a group-based one. In both cases, the investigation\nuses a complex and multimodal research structure that combines a drawing-based\napproach with a conversational-discursive methodology. This paper focuses on\nthe individual based data collection (348 drawings and 118 interviews).\nPreliminary results show that the human-like representation of robots is not\nthe only one, even though it is present in about 64%of the drawings, and that\nthis percentage decreases after the interview about robotics. Moreover, in\nseveral cases children refer to some concepts related to programming (e.g. the\npresence of sensors or human beings that make robots do things).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2018 17:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

However, the deployment of smaller cells inevitably leads to more\nfrequent handovers, thus making mobility management more challenging and\nreducing the capacity gains offered by the dense network deployment. In order\nto fully reap the gains for mobile users in such a network environment, we\npropose an intelligent dual connectivity mechanism for mobility management\nthrough deep learning-based mobility prediction. We first use LSTM (Long Short\nTerm Memory) algorithm, one of deep learning algorithms, to learn every user\nequipment's (UE's) mobility pattern from its historical trajectories and\npredict its movement trends in the future. Based on the corresponding\nprediction results, the network will judge whether a handover is required for\nthe UE. For the handover case, a dual connection will be established for the\nrelated UE. Thus, the UE can get the radio signal from two base stations in the\nhandover process. Simulation results verify that the proposed intelligent dual\nconnectivity mechanism can significantly improve the quality of service of\nmobile users in the handover process while guaranteeing the network energy\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 07:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}
