The control system\nconsists of two components: 1) a preset PID component and 2) a learning\nfeedforward component which is a function approximator that is adapted on the\nbasis of the feedback signal. A B-spline network based LFFC and a low-pass\nfilter based LFFC are designed to track the desired outlet temperature of\nevaporator secondary flux and the superheating degree of refrigerant at\nevaporator outlet. Encouraging simulation results are included. Qualitative and\nquantitative comparison results evaluations show that, with little effort, a\nhigh-performance control system can be obtained with this approach. Our initial\nsimple attempt of low-pass filter based LFFC and B-spline network based LFFC\ngive J=0.4902 and J=0.6536 relative to the decentralized PID controller,\nrespectively. Besides, the initial attempt of a combination controller of our\noptimized PI controller and low-pass filter LFFC gives J=0.6947 relative to the\nmulti-variable PID controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 17:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

Therefore, any\nseasonal, illumination and environmental changes typically lead to severe\ndegradation in performance. To cope with this problem, recent works have\nproposed to adopt domain adaptation techniques. While effective, these methods\nassume that some prior information about the scenario where the robot will\noperate is available at training time. Unfortunately, in many cases this\nassumption does not hold, as we often do not know where a robot will be\ndeployed. To overcome this issue, in this paper we present an approach which\naims at learning classification models able to generalize to unseen scenarios.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for domain\ngeneralization. Our method develops from the intuition that, given a set of\ndifferent classification models associated to known domains (e.g. corresponding\nto multiple environments, robots), the best model for a new sample in the novel\ndomain can be computed directly at test time by optimally combining the known\nmodels. To implement our idea, we exploit recent advances in deep domain\nadaptation and design a Convolutional Neural Network architecture with novel\nlayers performing a weighted version of Batch Normalization. Our experiments,\nconducted on three common datasets for robot place categorization, confirm the\nvalidity of our contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 16:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

It follows that if X is projective with polarization L, the\nprojective Kuga-Satake torus of (X,L) is isogenous to the fourth power of\nJ^3(X). By studying the cohomology ring of X, we find that there is a natural\nsmooth quadric Q(X) in the projectivization of H^3(X), with a natural choice of\none of the two irreducible components of the variety parametrizing maximal\nlinear subspaces of Q(X).

However, such network\ncompression can result in irregular matrix structures that are mismatched with\nmodern hardware-accelerated platforms, such as graphics processing units (GPUs)\ndesigned to perform the DNN matrix multiplications in a structured\n(block-based) way. We propose MPDCompress, a DNN compression algorithm based on\nmatrix permutation decomposition via random mask generation. In-training\napplication of the masks molds the synaptic weight connection matrix to a\nsub-graph separation format. Aided by the random permutations, a\nhardware-desirable block matrix is generated, allowing for a more efficient\nimplementation and compression of the network. To show versatility, we\nempirically verify MPDCompress on several network models, compression rates,\nand image datasets. On the LeNet 300-100 model (MNIST dataset), Deep MNIST, and\nCIFAR10, we achieve 10 X network compression with less than 1% accuracy loss\ncompared to non-compressed accuracy performance. On AlexNet for the full\nImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset, we achieve 8 X network compression with less than\n1% accuracy loss, with top-5 and top-1 accuracies of 79.6% and 56.4%,\nrespectively. Finally, we observe that the algorithm can offer inference\nspeedups across various hardware platforms, with 4 X faster operation achieved\non several mobile GPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 17:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}

However, the vast\nmajority of these works relies on a critical assumption where the oscillators'\nnatural frequencies are drawn from a Cauchy, or Lorentzian, distribution, which\nallows for a convenient closure of the evolution equations from the\ndimensionality reduction. In this paper we investigate the low dimensional\ndynamics that emerge from a broader family of natural frequency distributions,\nin particular a family of rational distribution functions. We show that, as the\npolynomials that characterize the frequency distribution increase in order, the\nlow dimensional evolution equations become more complicated, but nonetheless\nthe system dynamics remain simple, displaying a transition from incoherence to\npartial synchronization at a critical coupling strength. Using the low\ndimensional equations we analytically calculate the critical coupling strength\ncorresponding to the onset of synchronization and investigate the scaling\nproperties of the order parameter near the onset of synchronization.

This is because neural networks are good at generation\nwithin the manifold of the data that they are trained on. However, generating\nnew samples outside of the manifold or extrapolating \"out-of-sample\" is a much\nharder problem that has been less well studied. To address this, we introduce a\ntechnique called neuron editing that learns how neurons encode an edit for a\nparticular transformation in a latent space. We use an autoencoder to decompose\nthe variation within the dataset into activations of different neurons and\ngenerate transformed data by defining an editing transformation on those\nneurons.

We also study the\nmodel's vertex deviation of the velocity ellipsoid as a function of stellar\nmetallicity and age in the equivalent of Baade's Window. The formation of the\nbar leads to a non-zero vertex deviation. We find that metal-rich stars have a\nlarge vertex deviation (~ 40 degrees), which becomes negligible for metal-poor\nstars, a trend also found in the Milky Way, despite not matching in detail. We\ndemonstrate that the vertex deviation also varies with stellar age and is large\nfor stars as old as 9 Gyr, while 13 Gyr old stars have negligible vertex\ndeviation.

However, structural importance may not suffice to\npredict successful diffusions in a wide range of applications, such as\nword-of-mouth marketing and political campaigns. In particular, nodes with high\nstructural importance may contribute negatively to the objective of the\ndiffusion. To address this problem, we propose contextual centrality, which\nintegrates structural positions, the diffusion process, and, most importantly,\nnodal contributions to the objective of the diffusion. We perform an empirical\nanalysis of the adoption of microfinance in Indian villages and weather\ninsurance in Chinese villages. Results show that contextual centrality of the\nfirst-informed individuals has higher predictive power towards the eventual\nadoption outcomes than other standard centrality measures. Interestingly, when\nthe product of diffusion rate $p$ and the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is\nlarger than one and diffusion period is long, contextual centrality linearly\nscales with eigenvector centrality. This approximation reveals that contextual\ncentrality identifies scenarios where a higher diffusion rate of individuals\nmay negatively influence the cascade payoff. Further simulations on the\nsynthetic and real-world networks show that contextual centrality has the\nadvantage of selecting an individual whose local neighborhood generates a high\ncascade payoff when $p \\lambda_1 < 1$. Under this condition, stronger homophily\nleads to higher cascade payoff. Our results suggest that contextual centrality\ncaptures more complicated dynamics on networks and has significant implications\nfor applications, such as information diffusion, viral marketing, and political\ncampaigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 20:14:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 01:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

Screened modified gravity models can exhibit complex\nbehaviour there without violating stringent tests of gravity within our Solar\nSystem. They might hence provide viable extensions of the theory of gravity.\nHere, we use galaxy kinematics to constrain screened modified gravity models.\nWe focus on chameleon $f(R)$ gravity and predict its impact on galaxy rotation\ncurves and radial acceleration relations. This is achieved by post-processing\nstate-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations from the \\textsc{auriga project},\nusing the \\textsc{mg-gadget} code. For a given galaxy, the surface dividing\nscreened and un-screened regions adopts an oblate shape, reflecting the disc\nmorphology of the galaxy's mass distribution. At the `screening radius'---the\nradius at which screening is triggered in the disc plane---characteristic\n`upturns' are present in both rotation curves and radial acceleration\nrelations. The locations of these features depend on various factors, such as\nthe galaxy mass, the concentration of the density profile and the value of the\nbackground field amplitude $f_{R0}$. Self-screening of stars and environmental\nscreening also play a role. For Milky Way-size galaxies, we find that a model\nwith $|f_{R0}|=10^{-7}$ results in rotation curves that are indistinguishable\nfrom $\\Lambda$CDM, while for $|f_{R0}| \\geq 2 \\times 10^{-6}$ the simulated\ngalaxies are entirely unscreened, violating Solar System constraints. For\nintermediate values, distinct upturns are present.

The main feature of a finite dynamical system is its interaction\ngraph, which indicates which local functions depend on which variables; the\ninteraction graph is a qualitative representation of the interactions amongst\nentities on the network. As such, a major problem is to determine the effect of\nthe interaction graph on the dynamics of the FDS. In this paper, we are\ninterested in three main properties of an FDS: the number of images (the\nso-called rank), the number of periodic points (the so-called periodic rank)\nand the number of fixed points. In particular, we investigate the minimum,\naverage, and maximum number of images (or periodic points, or fixed points) of\nFDSs with a prescribed interaction graph and a given alphabet size; thus\nyielding nine quantities to study. The paper is split into two parts. The first\npart considers the minimum rank, for which we derive the first meaningful\nresults known so far. In particular, we show that the minimum rank decreases\nwith the alphabet size, thus yielding the definition of an absolute minimum\nrank. We obtain lower and upper bounds on this absolute minimum rank, and we\ngive classification results for graphs with very low (or highest) rank. The\nsecond part is a comprehensive survey of the results obtained on the nine\nquantities described above.

Complex models suffer from uncertainty and\nexperiments are needed to reduce this uncertainty. Because experiments can be\ncostly and time-consuming it is desirable to determine experiments providing\nthe most useful information. If a sequence of experiments is to be performed,\nexperimental design is needed to determine the order. A classical approach is\nto maximally reduce the overall uncertainty in the model, meaning maximal\nentropy reduction. A recently proposed method takes into account both model\nuncertainty and the translational objective, for instance, optimal structural\nintervention in gene regulatory networks, where the aim is to alter the\nregulatory logic to maximally reduce the long-run likelihood of being in a\ncancerous state. The mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU) quantifies\nuncertainty based on the degree to which model uncertainty affects the\nobjective. Experimental design involves choosing the experiment that yields the\ngreatest reduction in MOCU. This paper introduces finite-horizon dynamic\nprogramming for MOCU-based sequential experimental design and compares it to\nthe greedy approach, which selects one experiment at a time without\nconsideration of the full horizon of experiments. A salient aspect of the paper\nis that it demonstrates the advantage of MOCU-based design over the widely used\nentropy-based design for both greedy and dynamic-programming strategies and\ninvestigates the effect of model conditions on the comparative performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 22:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

Most\nof the operations in the harmonic-summing module are relatively cheap\noperations for FPGAs.

Although\nharmonic-summing alone might not be targeted for FPGA acceleration, it is a\npart of the pulsar search pipeline that contains many other compute-intensive\nmodules, which are efficiently executed on FPGA. Hence having the\nharmonic-summing also on the FPGA will avoid off-board communication, which\ncould destroy other acceleration benefits. Two types of harmonic-summing\napproaches are investigated in this paper: 1) storing intermediate data in\noff-chip memory and 2) processing the input signals directly without storing.\nFor the second type, two approaches of caching data are proposed and evaluated:\n1) preloading points that are frequently touched 2) preloading all necessary\npoints that are used to generate a chunk of output points. OpenCL is adopted to\nimplement the proposed approaches. In an extensive experimental evaluation, the\nsame OpenCL kernel codes are evaluated on FPGA boards and GPU cards.

We observe, by introducing the turbulence\nin photon path we are loosing the entanglement property, because of the\nincrease in entropy. We compare our result with Werner curve and observe that\nthe simulated result perfectly fit with the theoretical result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 00:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 22:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 21:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

This paper considers the energyefficient design\nof a multi-pair decode-and-forward relay-based IoT network, in which multiple\nsources simultaneously transmit their information to the corresponding\ndestinations via a relay equipped with a large array. In order to obtain an\naccurate yet tractable expression of the EE, firstly, a closed-form expression\nof the EE is derived under an idealized simplifying assumption, in which the\nlocation of each device is known by the network. Then, an exact integral-based\nexpression of the EE is derived under the assumption that the devices are\nrandomly scattered following a uniform distribution and transmit power of the\nrelay is equally shared among the destination devices.

The low-energy extent of non-thermal emission has only been loosely\nquantified. It has been difficult to obtain a lower limit for a possible\nnon-thermal cutoff energy due to the significantly dominant thermal emission.\n  Here we use solar flare data from the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE)\non-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-ray data from the Reuven\nRamaty High Energy Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) to calculate the Differential\nEmission Measure (DEM). This improvement over the isothermal approximation and\nany single-instrument DEM helps to resolve ambiguities in the range where\nthermal and non-thermal emission overlap, and to provide constraints on the\nlow-energy cutoff.\n  In the model, thermal emission is from a DEM that is parametrized as multiple\ngaussians in $Log(T)$.

Some of these schemes that are based on the\nreaction-diffusion master equation (RDME), can simulate for extended spatial\nand temporal scales but cannot directly account for the microscopic effects in\nthe cell such as volume exclusion and diffusion-influenced reactions.\nNonetheless, schemes based on the high-resolution microscopic lattice method\n(MLM) can directly simulate these effects by representing each finite-sized\nmolecule explicitly as a random walker on fine lattice voxels. The theory and\nconsistency of MLM in simulating diffusion-influenced reactions have not been\nclarified in detail.

Applying\nthe random walk theory, we construct the general theoretical framework\nunderlying the method and obtain analytical expressions for the total rebinding\nprobability and the effective reaction rate.

To\ncapture all possible preferred blocking schemes, scheme skyline (i.e. blocking\nschemes on the skyline) has been studied in a multi-dimensional scheme space\nwith dimensions corresponding to selection criteria for blocking (e.g. PC and\nPQ). However, applying traditional skyline techniques to learn scheme skylines\nis a non-trivial task. Due to the unique characteristics of blocking schemes,\nwe face several challenges, such as: how to find a balanced number of match and\nnon-match labels to effectively approximate a block scheme in a scheme space,\nand how to design efficient skyline algorithms to explore a scheme space for\nfinding scheme skylines. To overcome these challenges, we propose a scheme\nskyline learning approach, which incorporates skyline techniques into an active\nlearning process of scheme skylines. We have conducted experiments over four\nreal-world datasets. The experimental results show that our approach is able to\nefficiently identify scheme skylines in a large scheme space only using a\nlimited number of labels.

Recently, another mechanism has\nbeen suggested within the context of the He detonation-triggered SN scenario\n(i.e., double detonation scenario or He-ignited violent merger), in which the\nradioactive isotopes in the outermost layer of the SN ejecta produce the early\nemission. In this paper, we investigate properties of the early-phase excessive\nemission predicted by these different scenarios. The He detonation scenario\nshows different behaviors in the early flash than the companion/CSM interaction\nscenarios. Especially clear diagnostics is provided once the behaviors in the\nUV and in the optical are combined. The spectra synthesized for the He\ndetonation scenario are characterized by the absorptions due to the He\ndetonation products, which especially develop in the decay phase. We further\nexpect a relation between the properties of the early-phase flash and those of\nthe maximum SN emission, in a way the brighter and slower initial flash is\naccompanied by a more substantial effect of the additional absorptions (and\nreddening). This relation, however, should be considered together with the\nmaximum luminosity of the SN, since the larger luminosity suppresses the effect\nof the additional absorption. With these expected features, we address the\npossible origins of the observed excessive early-phase emission for a few SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 05:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

When an\nauthorized user requests authentication, claiming his/her identity as one of\nthe subscribers, he/she has to provide a biometric signal again, and then the\nsystem, which retrieves also the helper message of the claimed subscriber,\nproduces an estimate of the secret key, that is finally compared to the secret\nkey of the claimed user.

Davidovits and N. J. Fisch, \"Sudden viscous dissipation of\ncompressing turbulence,\" Phys. Rev. Lett., 116(105004), 2016) demonstrated that\nthe compression of a turbulent field can lead to a sudden viscous dissipation\nof turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and suggested this mechanism could\npotentially be used to design new fast-ignition schemes for inertial\nconfinement fusion. We expand on previous work by accounting for finite Mach\nnumbers, rather than relying on a zero-Mach-limit assumption as previously\ndone. The finite-Mach-number formulation is necessary to capture a\nself-consistent feedback mechanism in which dissipated TKE increases the\ntemperature of the system, which in turn modifies the viscosity and thus the\nTKE dissipation itself. Direct numerical simulations with a tenth-order\naccurate Pad\\'e scheme were carried out to analyze this self-consistent\nfeedback loop for compressing turbulence. Results show that, for finite Mach\nnumbers, the sudden viscous dissipation of TKE still occurs, both for the\nsolenoidal and dilatational turbulent fields. As the domain is compressed,\noscillations in dilatational TKE are encountered due to the highly-oscillatory\nnature of the pressure dilatation. An analysis of the source terms for the\ninternal energy shows that the mechanical work term dominates the viscous\nturbulent dissipation. As a result, the effect of the suddenly dissipated TKE\non temperature is minimal for the Mach numbers tested. Moreover, an analytical\nexpression is derived that confirms the dissipated TKE does not significantly\nalter the temperature evolution for low Mach numbers, regardless of compression\nspeed. The self-consistent feedback mechanism is thus quite weak for subsonic\nturbulence, which could limit its applicability for inertial confinement\nfusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 06:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Traditional IPMs typically use Newton's method\nto approximately solve a subproblem that aims to minimize a log-barrier penalty\nfunction at each iteration. Due its connection to Newton's method, IPM is often\nclassified as second-order method -- a genre that is attached with stability\nand accuracy at the expense of scalability. Indeed, computing a Newton step\namounts to solving a large linear system, which can be efficiently implemented\nif the input data are reasonably-sized and/or sparse and/or well-structured.\nHowever, in case the above premises fail, then the challenge still stands on\nthe way for a traditional IPM. To deal with this challenge, one approach is to\napply the iterative procedure, such as preconditioned conjugate gradient\nmethod, to solve the linear system. Since the linear system is different each\niteration, it is difficult to find good pre-conditioner to achieve the overall\nsolution efficiency. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed.\nInstead of applying Newton's method, we resort to the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) to approximately minimize the log-barrier penalty\nfunction at each iteration, under the framework of primal-dual path-following\nfor a homogeneous self-dual embedded LP model. The resulting algorithm is an\nADMM-Based Interior Point Method, abbreviated as ABIP in this paper. The new\nmethod inherits stability from IPM, and scalability from ADMM. Because of its\nself-dual embedding structure, ABIP is set to solve any LP without requiring\nprior knowledge about its feasibility. We conduct extensive numerical\nexperiments testing ABIP with large-scale LPs from NETLIB and machine learning\napplications. The results demonstrate that ABIP compares favorably with\nexisting LP solvers including SDPT3, MOSEK, DSDP-CG and SCS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 07:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 05:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

While complex shapes can be classified through qualitative\nanalyses, the results are subjective due to the difficulty of categorizing\ncomplex shapes into a single class. Although quantitative analyses are\nobjective, selection of shape parameters is required. Here, we applied a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash.\nFirst, we defined four basal particle shapes (blocky, vesicular, elongated,\nrounded) generated by different eruption mechanisms (e.g., brittle\nfragmentation), and then trained the CNN using particles composed of only one\nbasal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shapes with over 90% accuracy.\nUsing the trained network, we classified ash particles composed of multiple\nbasal shapes based on the output of the network, which can be interpreted as a\nmixing ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of samples by the averaged\nprobabilities and the intensity is consistent with the eruption type. The\nmixing ratio output by the CNN can be used to quantitatively classify complex\nshapes in nature without categorizing forcibly and without the need for shape\nparameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 07:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

In addition,\nsensor nodes in UWSNs are usually powered by batteries whose replacements\nintroduce high cost and complexity. Thus, the critical problem in UWSNs is to\nenable each sensor node to find enough anchor nodes in order to localize\nitself, with minimum energy costs. In this paper, an Energy-Efficient\nLocalization Algorithm (EELA) is proposed to analyze the decentralized\ninteractions among sensor nodes and anchor nodes. A\nSingle-Leader-Multi-Follower Stackelberg game is utilized to formulate the\ntopology control problem of sensor nodes and anchor nodes by exploiting their\navailable communication opportunities. In this game, the sensor node acts as a\nleader taking into account factors such as 'two-hop' anchor nodes and energy\nconsumption, while anchor nodes act as multiple followers, considering their\nability to localize sensor nodes and their energy consumption. We prove that\nboth players select best responses and reach a socially optimal Stackelberg\nNash Equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EELA\nimproves the perfor- mance of localization in UWSNs significantly, and in\nparticular the energy cost of sensor nodes. Compared to the baseline schemes,\nthe energy consumption per node is about 48% lower in EELA, while providing a\ndesirable localization coverage, under reasonable error and delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 07:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

This practice involves significant waste and\ncost of herbicide for farmers and environmental pollution. One way to reduce\nthe cost and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide\nat the right place and at the right time (Precision Agriculture). Nowadays,\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is becoming an interesting acquisition system for\nweeds localization and management due to its ability to obtain the images of\nthe entire agricultural field with a very high spatial resolution and at low\ncost. Despite the important advances in UAV acquisition systems, automatic\nweeds detection remains a challenging problem because of its strong similarity\nwith the crops. Recently Deep Learning approach has shown impressive results in\ndifferent complex classification problem. However, this approach needs a\ncertain amount of training data but, creating large agricultural datasets with\npixel-level annotations by expert is an extremely time consuming task. In this\npaper, we propose a novel fully automatic learning method using Convolutional\nNeuronal Networks (CNNs) with unsupervised training dataset collection for\nweeds detection from UAV images. The proposed method consists in three main\nphases. First we automatically detect the crop lines and using them to identify\nthe interline weeds. In the second phase, interline weeds are used to\nconstitute the training dataset. Finally, we performed CNNs on this dataset to\nbuild a model able to detect the crop and weeds in the images. The results\nobtained are comparable to the traditional supervised training data labeling.\nThe accuracy gaps are 1.5% in the spinach field and 6% in the bean field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 09:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

As the disk accretion rate increases, the disk innermost regions\nwould change from a jet-emitting disk (JED) to a standard accretion disk (SAD).\nWhile JEDs have been proven to successfully reproduce hard states (paper II),\nthe existence of an outer cold SAD introduces an extra non local cooling term.\nWe investigate the thermal structure and associated spectra of such a hybrid\ndisk configuration. We use the 2T plasma code elaborated in paper II, allowing\nto compute outside-in the disk local thermal equilibrium with self-consistent\nadvection and optically thin-to-thick transitions, in both radiation and gas\nsupported regimes. The non-local inverse Compton cooling introduced by the\nexternal soft photons is computed by the BELM code. This additional term has a\nprofound influence on JED solutions, allowing a smooth temperature transition\nfrom the outer SAD to the inner JED. We explore the full parameter space in\ndisk accretion rate and transition radius, and show that the whole domain in\nX-ray fluxes and hardness ratios covered by standard XrB cycles is well\nreproduced by such hybrid configurations. Precisely, a reasonable combination\nof these parameters allows to reproduce the 3-200 keV spectra of five canonical\nXrB states. Along with X-ray signatures, JED-SAD configurations also naturally\naccount for the radio emission whenever it is observed. By varying only the\ntransition radius and the accretion rate, hybrid disk configurations combining\nan inner JED and an outer SAD are able to reproduce simultaneously the X-ray\nspectral states and radio emission of X-ray binaries during their outburst.\nAdjusting these two parameters, it is then possible to reproduce a full cycle.\nThis will be shown in a forthcoming paper (paper IV).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 10:16:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

It is often the case that a node is not only\ninfluenced by its immediate neighbors but also by higher order neighbors,\nmultiple hops away. Recent state-of-the-art models for CC learn end-to-end\ndifferentiable variations of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernels to aggregate\nmulti-hop neighborhood information. In this work, we propose a Higher Order\nPropagation Framework, HOPF, which provides an iterative inference mechanism\nfor these powerful differentiable kernels. Such a combination of classical\niterative inference mechanism with recent differentiable kernels allows the\nframework to learn graph convolutional filters that simultaneously exploit the\nattribute and label information available in the neighborhood. Further, these\niterative differentiable kernels can scale to larger hops beyond the memory\nlimitations of existing differentiable kernels. We also show that existing WL\nkernel-based models suffer from the problem of Node Information Morphing where\nthe information of the node is morphed or overwhelmed by the information of its\nneighbors when considering multiple hops. To address this, we propose a\nspecific instantiation of HOPF, called the NIP models, which preserves the node\ninformation at every propagation step. The iterative formulation of NIP models\nfurther helps in incorporating distant hop information concisely as summaries\nof the inferred labels.

Transient\nbonds can provide mechanical rigidity, while still allowing for visco-elastic\nflows on timescales longer than the bond lifetime. In many biological polymer\nnetworks such as the actin cytoskeleton, the short-lived bonds are formed by\naccessory proteins that diffuse away after unbinding. By contrast, bonds in\nsynthetic networks, such as the pendant groups of telechelic polymers, can only\nrebind in the same location. Using a recently developed theoretical model of\nthe fracturing of visco-elastic materials, we here investigate the effect of\nlinker mobility on the bond dynamics of a network under stress. We find that\nalthough mean field properties such as the average bond linker lifetime are\nbarely affected by bond mobility, networks cross linked by mobile bonds\nfracture more readily due to 'leaking' of linkers from crack areas to less\nstressed regions within the network. We propose a theoretical model to describe\nthe redistribution of mobile linkers, which we validate by simulations.

This correction can modify the cross section at the few percent\nlevel. In contrast, dispersive effects can cause significantly larger changes\nfrom the Born approximation. The purpose of this experiment is to extract the\ncarbon-12 elastic cross section around the first diffraction minimum, where the\nBorn term contributions to the cross section are small to maximize the\nsensitivity to dispersive effects. The analysis uses the LEDEX data from the\nhigh resolution Jefferson Lab Hall A spectrometers to extract the cross\nsections near the first diffraction minimum of 12C at beam energies of 362 MeV\nand 685 MeV. The results are in very good agreement with previous world data,\nalthough with less precision. The average deviation from a static nuclear\ncharge distribution expected from linear and quadratic fits indicate a 30.6%\ncontribution of dispersive effects to the cross section at 1 GeV. The magnitude\nof the dispersive effects near the first diffraction minimum of 12C has been\nconfirmed to be large with a strong energy dependence and could account for a\nlarge fraction of the magnitude for the observed quenching of the longitudinal\nnuclear response. These effects could also be important for nuclei radii\nextracted from parity-violating asymmetries measured near a diffraction\nminimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 12:40:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 23:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

The model, which in its unperturbed case is\ncomposed only by two energy levels, includes two interacting terms. A first\none, the $V$ interaction, which promotes or degrade pairs of particles, and a\nsecond one, the $W$ interaction, which scatters one particle in the upper and\nanother in the lower energy level. In comparing this model with other\napproximation methods, the $W$ term interaction is often set to zero. In this\npaper, we show how the presence of this interaction changes the global\nstructure of the system, generates degeneracies between the various eigenstates\nand modifies the energy eigenvalues structure. We present analytical solutions\nfor systems of two and three particles and, for some specific cases, also for\nfour, six and eight particles. The solutions for systems with more than eight\nparticles are only numerical but their behaviour can be well understood by\nconsidering the extrapolations of the analytical results.

We consider\nthe scaling of the free energies with respect to varying the persistence length\nof the polymer, as well as the channel dimensions for confinement in\ncylindrical, rectangular and triangular channels. We focus on polymer behaviour\nin both the classic Odijk and back folded Odijk regimes. We find the scaling of\nthe entropic force to be close to that predicted from a scaling argument that\ntreats interactions between deflection segments at the second virial level. In\naddition, the measured hairpin fold free energy is consistent with that\nobtained directly from a recent theoretical calculation for cylindrical\nchannels. It is also consistent with values determined from measurements of the\nglobal persistence length of a polymer in the backfolded Odijk regime in recent\nsimulation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 14:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Here we focus\non so-called Lambda-Omega differential equations, a well-studied generalization\nof the celebrated Ginzburg-Landau equation, to show that there exists an\ninterval of sufficiently small coupling values for which a rotating wave\nsolution persists. This result is achieved using a wide range of functional\nanalytic tools, primarily in an effort to apply a non-standard Implicit\nFunction Theorem.

We complement\nthis by characterizing the evolution of the associated network magnetic field.\nWe use one year of data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to\nmeasure horizontal near-surface flows near the solar equator by applying\ntime-distance helioseismology on Dopplergrams and granulation tracking on\nintensity images. The average supergranule outflow (or inflow) is constructed\nby averaging over 10000 individual outflows (or inflows).

We find a\nplateau for kR>120. In real space, larger supergranules undergo oscillations\nwith longer periods and lifetimes than smaller cells. We find excellent\nagreement between TD and LCT and obtain wave properties that are independent of\nthe tracking rate. The observed network magnetic field follows the oscillations\nof the supergranular flows with a six-hour time lag. This behavior can be\nexplained by computing the motions of corks carried by the supergranular flows.\nSignatures of supergranular waves in surface horizontal flows near the solar\nequator can be observed in real space. These oscillatory flows control the\nevolution of the network magnetic field, in particular they explain the\nrecently discovered east-west anisotropy of the magnetic field around the\naverage supergranule.

Practically, the system inputs are often\nassumed to be mutually independent or correlated by a multivariate Gaussian\ndistribution. However, this subjective assumption may introduce bias in the\nresponse estimate if the real dependence structure deviates from this\nassumption. In this work, we overcome this limitation by introducing a flexible\ncopula dependence model to capture complex dependencies. A hierarchical\nBayesian multimodel approach is proposed to quantify uncertainty in dependence\nmodel-form and model parameters that result from small data sets. This approach\nbegins by identifying, through Bayesian multimodel inference, a set of\ncandidate marginal models and their corresponding model probabilities, and then\nestimating the uncertainty in the copula-based dependence structure, which is\nconditional on the marginals and their parameters. The overall uncertainties\nintegrating marginals and copulas are probabilistically represented by an\nensemble of multivariate candidate densities. A novel importance sampling\nreweighting approach is proposed to efficiently propagate the overall\nuncertainties through a computational model. Through an example studying the\ninfluence of constituent properties on the out-of-plane properties of\ntransversely isotropic E- glass fiber composites, we show that the composite\nproperty with copula-based dependence model converges to the true estimate as\ndata set size increases, while an independence or arbitrary Gaussian\ncorrelation assumption leads to a biased estimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 15:54:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 15:18:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 19:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

One of the\nkeys to their success lies in the richness of the automatically learned\nfeatures. In order to get very good accuracy, one popular option is to increase\nthe depth of the network. Training such a deep network is however infeasible or\nimpractical with moderate computational resources and budget. The other\nalternative to increase the performance is to learn multiple weak classifiers\nand boost their performance using a boosting algorithm or a variant thereof.\nBut, one of the problems with boosting algorithms is that they require a\nre-training of the networks based on the misclassified samples. Motivated by\nthese problems, in this work we propose an aggregation technique which combines\nthe output of multiple weak classifiers. We formulate the aggregation problem\nusing a mixture model fitted to the trained classifier outputs. Our model does\nnot require any re-training of the `weak' networks and is computationally very\nfast (takes $<30$ seconds to run in our experiments). Thus, using a less\nexpensive training stage and without doing any re-training of networks, we\nexperimentally demonstrate that it is possible to boost the performance by\n$12\\%$. Furthermore, we present experiments using hand-crafted features and\nimproved the classification performance using the proposed aggregation\ntechnique. One of the major advantages of our framework is that our framework\nallows one to combine features that are very likely to be of distinct\ndimensions since they are extracted using different networks/algorithms. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate a significant performance gain from the use of\nour aggregation technique at a very small computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 01:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

To address this issue, we devise a robust real-time ellipse\nfitting approach based on two kinds of analog neural network, Lagrange\nprogramming neural network (LPNN) and locally competitive algorithm (LCA).\nFirst, to alleviate the influence of these outliers, the fitting task is\nformulated as a nonsmooth constrained optimization problem in which the\nobjective function is either an l1-norm or l0-norm term. It is because compared\nwith the l2-norm in some traditional ellipse fitting models, the lp-norm with\np<2 is less sensitive to outliers. Then, to calculate a real-time solution of\nthis optimization problem, LPNN is applied. As the LPNN model cannot handle the\nnon-differentiable term in its objective, the concept of LCA is introduced and\ncombined with the LPNN framework.

The relation between performance times\nandthese factors are not directly derivable, though, performance time has a\ndirect correlation with discharge of batteries. Inroute planning, travel time\nof an edge is the performance time and may be required to be estimated for\nmultiple times.These estimated travel times are different than heuristics costs\nas they depict the real states which are impossible toknow from heuristics.\nThis facilitates path planning algorithms to choose the edges with least real\ntravel times or coststo form the path. Nevertheless, a good estimation is\ndependent on historical data which are close in time. But, there aresituations\nwhen all the travel times for one or more edge(s) are not available for the\nentire duration of operation of theMRS to an individual robot. Then, it is\nimperative for that robot to gather the necessary travel times from others\ninthe system as a reference observation. The mechanism of information sharing\nbetween one robot to others in the systemhas been devised in a form of a common\nontology-based knowledge. This ontology helps to fetch and share\ninformationforming a collective knowledge base facilitating a comprehensive\ncontrol and planning for the system. This greatly helpsthe MR to estimate\ntravel times more accurately and precisely. Also, accurate estimation affects\nroute planning to bemore precise with reduced cost. The total cost of paths\ngenerated through the travel times estimated through sharingis 40% less on\naverage than that of paths generated through travel times without sharing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 08:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

Before a medical diagnostic test is routinely\nused in practice, its ability to distinguish between diseased and nondiseased\nstates must be rigorously assessed through statistical analysis. The receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curve is the most popular used tool for\nevaluating the discriminatory ability of continuous-outcome diagnostic tests.\nIt has been acknowledged that several factors (e.g., subject-specific\ncharacteristics, such as age and/or gender) can affect the test's accuracy\nbeyond disease status. Recently, the covariate-adjusted ROC curve has been\nproposed and successfully applied as a global summary measure of diagnostic\naccuracy that takes covariate information into account. We motivate the use of\nthe covariate-adjusted ROC curve and develop a highly robust model based on a\ncombination of B-splines dependent Dirichlet process mixture models and the\nBayesian bootstrap. Multiple simulation studies demonstrate the ability of our\nmodel to successfully recover the true covariate-adjusted ROC curve and to\nproduce valid inferences in a variety of complex scenarios. Our methods are\nmotivated by and applied to an endocrine study where the main goal is to assess\nthe accuracy of the body mass index, adjusted for age and gender, for\npredicting clusters of cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Unanticipated by conventional\ntreatments, this type of reversible aggregation nonetheless can take place if\nthe solute molecules bind transiently with each other to form long-lived\ncomplexes. The binding causes kinetic stabilization of inclusions of the\nsolute-rich phase---within a substantial size range---so as to render the\ncritical size for nucleation of the inclusions finite.

The outcomes indicated that the AHP technique makes it simpler to\nassign weights for the different criteria for evaluating the vendor. Research\nfindings showed that quality is the most important criterion followed by\ndelivery, cost and vendor relationship management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 14:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

In this paper, we show that it is feasible,\nand in fact practical, to use a compiler-based strategy instead. Using compiler\ntooling, we propose and implement a transformation which takes a standard\nprogram and outputs a program that performs semantically equivalent, but\npartially symbolic, computation. The transformed program maintains symbolic\nvalues internally and operates directly on them hence the program can be\nprocessed by a tool without support for symbolic manipulation.\n  The main motivation for the transformation is in symbolic verification, but\nthere are many other possible use-cases, including test generation and concolic\ntesting. Moreover using the transformation simplifies tools, since the symbolic\ncomputation is handled by the program directly. We have implemented the\ntransformation at the level of LLVM bitcode. The paper includes an experimental\nevaluation, based on an explicit-state software model checker as a verification\nbackend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 11:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

It is shown that strong\ntemperature dependence of the control radiation absorption coefficient $k(T)$\nis the main factor determining the maximum switching frequency $f_{max}$ and\nthe corresponding maximum crystal temperature $T_{max}$, as well as\ndistributions of temperature $T$ and current density $j$ over a device area. A\ntwo-dimensional analysis of the simplest electrothermal model of VPSS embedded\ninto a double coaxial forming line showed that an increase in the switching\nfrequency $f$ leads to displacement of current to device periphery, where the\ntemperature is minimal. However, distributions of $T$ and $j$ over the device\narea remain stable if $f < f_{max}$ and $T < T_{max}$. Of course, the values\n$f_{max}$ and $T_{max}$ depend on the energy of control radiation pulses, pulse\nswitching power and heat sink conditions. For VPSS based on nondirect-gap\nsemiconductors (Si, SiC), they varies within 20-120 kHz and 120-160 $^o C$,\nquite sufficient for practical application. However, VPSS based on direct-gap\nsemiconductors (GaAs, InP) are not actually suitable for operation in\nhigh-frequency modes due to too sharp dependence $k(T)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 10:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

However, BEVs, unlike ICEVs, are still not\nwidely accepted in the automobile market but continuing technological change\ncould overcome this barrier. The aim of this study is to assess and forecast\nwhether and when design changes and technological improvements related to major\nchallenges in driving range and battery cost will make the user value of BEVs\ngreater than the user value of ICEVs. Specifically, we estimate the relative\nuser value of BEVs and ICEVs resulting after design modifications to achieve\ndifferent driving ranges by considering the engineering trade-offs based on a\nvehicle simulation. Then, we analyze when the relative user value of BEVs is\nexpected to exceed ICEVs as the energy density and cost of batteries improve\nbecause of ongoing technological change. Our analysis demonstrates that the\nrelative value of BEVs is lower than that of ICEVs because BEVs have high\nbattery cost and high cost of time spent recharging despite high torque, high\nfuel efficiency, and low fuel cost. Moreover, we found the relative value\ndifferences between BEVs and ICEVs are found to be less in high performance\nlarge cars than in low performance compact cars because BEVs can achieve high\nacceleration performance more easily than ICEVs. In addition, this study\npredicts that in approximately 2050, high performance large BEVs could have\nhigher relative value than high performance large ICEVs because of\ntechnological improvements in batteries; however low performance compact BEVs\nare still very likely to have significantly lower user value than comparable\nICEVs until well beyond 2050.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 04:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}
