We begin in 1D with arbitrary disorder assigned to a\nfinite number of bonds and study how the system renormalizes, finding\nnon-trivial fixed point structure for any given bond with a separatrix at zero\nbond strength, equivalent to inserting a break in the chain. Either side of\nthis critical line, renormalization group (RG) trajectories flow towards one of\ntwo attractors on which the disordered bonds settle onto ferromagnetic or\nanti-ferromagnetic (AF) couplings of equal and opposite magnitude. Bonds that\nsettle on an AF attractor are equivalent to inserting a twist in the chain at\nthe location of the bond, implying a multi-kink ground state solution.\nQualitatively different behavior emerges at the RG step when bonds start to\ncoalesce, with the chain `untwisting' whenever two AF bonds coalesce. Our\nfindings generalize to higher dimensions for codimension one defects that are\nsparse from the perspective of the orthogonal complement lattice. In 2D, the\n$\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the model has an IR manifestation where one can\nconstruct field strengths and Wilson loops (which characterize frustration)\nfrom fundamental plaquette variables.

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) seeks to\navoid this challenge by instead inferring a reward function from expert\nbehavior. While appealing, it can be impractically expensive to collect\ndatasets of demonstrations that cover the variation common in the real world\n(e.g. opening any type of door). Thus in practice, IRL must commonly be\nperformed with only a limited set of demonstrations where it can be exceedingly\ndifficult to unambiguously recover a reward function. In this work, we exploit\nthe insight that demonstrations from other tasks can be used to constrain the\nset of possible reward functions by learning a \"prior\" that is specifically\noptimized for the ability to infer expressive reward functions from limited\nnumbers of demonstrations. We demonstrate that our method can efficiently\nrecover rewards from images for novel tasks and provide intuition as to how our\napproach is analogous to learning a prior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 17:29:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 16:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 18:34:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 18:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 19:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

From the fields of galaxy and AGN\nevolution to precision cosmology, the number of scientific projects relying on\nsuch distance measurements, called photometric redshifts, have exploded. The\nbenefits of photometric redshifts is that all sources detected in photometric\nimages can have some distance estimates relatively cheaply. The major drawback\nis that these cheap estimates have a low precision when compared with the\nresource-expensive spectroscopy. The methodology to estimate redshifts has been\nthrough several major revolutions throughout the last decades, triggered by\nincreasingly more stringent requirements on the photometric redshift accuracy.\nHere, we review the various techniques to obtain photometric redshifts, from\ntemplate-fitting to machine learning and hybrid systems.

While the model-checking problem of QCTL*ii is,\nin general, undecidable, we identify a syntactic fragment of hierarchical\nformulas and prove, using an automata-theoretic approach, that it is decidable.\nThe decidability result for SLii follows since the reduction maps hierarchical\ninstances of SLii to hierarchical formulas of QCTL*ii .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 17:57:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 15:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

This paper describes a mathematical interpretation of the\ntime-dependent mixing amplitudes as a complex hyperbolic rotation of the time\nevolution of those amplitudes without mixing, which involves a Lie group\n$SO(1,1,\\mathbb{C})$.\n  This allows a geometric interpretation of mixing as a curve into the\n$SO(1,1,\\mathbb{C})$ manifold, parameterized with the proper decay time, where\n$CP$ violation is the image of this curve at $t = 0$.\n  To show the power of this new interpretation, it is applied to several\naspects of the measurement of the CKM angle $\\gamma$ in $B$ decays to neutral\n$D$ mesons. On one hand, the charm mixing correction on the $CPV$ parameters is\nderived. On the other hand, it is shown how the expressions used in GLW, ADS\nand GGSZ methods are affected by charm mixing.

For moderate wave\nintensity, this interaction is well described by quasi-linear theory. However,\nrecent statistics of parallel propagating chorus waves have demonstrated that\n5-20% of the observed waves are sufficiently intense to interact nonlinearly\nwith electrons. Such interactions include phase trapping and phase bunching\n(nonlinear scattering) effects not described by the quasi-linear diffusion.

This suggests that\nAripiprazole has a significant and measurable effect on community structure in\nhealthy individuals but not in individuals who are diagnosed with\nschizophrenia. In contrast, we find for individuals are given the drug\nSulpiride that it is more difficult to separate the networks of patients from\nthose of controls. Overall, we observe differences in the effects of the drugs\n(and a placebo) on community structure in patients and controls and also that\nthis effect differs across groups. We thereby demonstrate that different types\nof antipsychotic drugs selectively affect mesoscale structures of brain\nnetworks, providing support that mesoscale structures such as communities are\nmeaningful functional units in the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 20:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 01:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

This framework\ndiffers from previous studies by explicitly accounting for the fluid inside the\nparticles, which is a by-product of the immersed boundary method, allowing us\nto close the momentum balance for the flow around a single rolling sphere. We\nthen compute a momentum balance of a laminar Poiseuille flow over a dense bed\nof particles, finding that the stresses remain in equilibrium even during\nunsteady flow conditions. While previous studies have focused on stresses for\nthe streamwise momentum balance, the present approach also allows us to\nevaluate stress balances in the vertical direction, which are necessary to\nunderstand the role that collisions and hydrodynamic drag play during dilation\nand contraction of particle beds. While our analysis accounts for the fluid and\nparticle phases separately, we attempt to establish a momentum balance for the\nfluid/particle mixture, but find that it does not completely close locally due\nto collision stresses not being resolved across the particle diameter. However,\nwe find a correlation between the local shear rate and the gap in the mixture\nbalance, which can potentially be used to close the balance for the mixture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 20:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

The processes underlying human segmentation of natural images are\nstill poorly understood. In part, this is because we lack segmentation models\nconsistent with experimental and theoretical knowledge in visual neuroscience.\nBiological sensory systems have been shown to approximate probabilistic\ninference to interpret their inputs. This requires a generative model that\ncaptures both the statistics of the sensory inputs and expectations about the\ncauses of those inputs. Following this hypothesis, we propose a probabilistic\ngenerative model of visual segmentation that combines knowledge about 1) the\nsensitivity of neurons in the visual cortex to statistical regularities in\nnatural images; and 2) the preference of humans to form contiguous partitions\nof visual space. We develop an efficient algorithm for training and inference\nbased on expectation-maximization and validate it on synthetic data.\nImportantly, with the appropriate choice of the prior, we derive an intuitive\nclosed--form update rule for assigning pixels to segments: at each iteration,\nthe pixel assignment probabilities to segments is the sum of the evidence (i.e.\nlocal pixel statistics) and prior (i.e. the assignments of neighboring pixels)\nweighted by their relative uncertainty. The model performs competitively on\nnatural images from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD), and we illustrate\nhow the likelihood and prior components improve segmentation relative to\ntraditional mixture models. Furthermore, our model explains some variability\nacross human subjects as reflecting local uncertainty about the number of\nsegments.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components in\nsmart grids. An AMI comprises of systems and networks, that collects and\nanalyzes data received from smart meters. In addition, AMI also provides\nintelligent management of various power-related applications and services based\non the data collected from smart meters. Thus, AMI plays a significant role in\nthe smooth functioning of smart grids.\n  AMI is a privileged target for security attacks as it is made up of systems\nthat are highly vulnerable to such attacks. Providing security to AMI is\nnecessary as adversaries can cause potential damage against infrastructures and\nprivacy in smart grid. One of the most effective and challenging topic's\nidentified, is the Key Management System (KMS), for sustaining the security\nconcerns in AMI. Therefore, KMS seeks to be a promising research area for\nfuture development of AMI. This survey work highlights the key security issues\nof advanced metering infrastructures and focuses on how key management\ntechniques can be utilized for safeguarding AMI. First of all, we explore the\nmain features of advanced metering infrastructures and identify the\nrelationship between smart grid and AMI. Then, we introduce the security issues\nand challenges of AMI. We also provide a classification of the existing works\nin literature that deal with secure key management system in AMI. Finally, we\nidentify possible future research directions of KMS in AMI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 22:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

Recently, it was\nshown that the problem of ghost correction can be reformulated as k-space\ninterpolation problem that can be solved using structured low-rank Hankel\nmatrix approaches. Another recent work showed that data driven Hankel matrix\ndecomposition can be reformulated to exhibit similar structures as deep\nconvolutional neural network.

To take advantage of the even and odd-phase directional\nredundancy, the k-space data is divided into two channels configured with even\nand odd phase encodings. The redundancies between coils are also exploited by\nstacking the multi-coil k-space data into additional input channels. Then, our\nk-space ghost correction network is trained to learn the interpolation kernel\nto estimate the missing virtual k-space data. For the accelerated EPI data, the\nsame neural network is trained to directly estimate the interpolation kernels\nfor missing k-space data from both ghost and subsampling.

Then, by comparing and contrasting the\nderivation in particle coordinates with that in center-of-mass coordinates, we\nphysically interpret the terms in the center-of-mass formulation, which is\nequivalent to the high-temperature partition function for molecules. We\ndiscuss, from a purely classical perspective, how and why cluster\ncharacteristics such as the symmetry number, moments of inertia, and\nvibrational frequencies affect the equilibrium probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 01:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

From the incidence (number per unit\nredshift; $n_{21}$) of HI 21-cm absorbers at $0.5<z<1$ and assuming no redshift\nevolution, we estimate the incidence of OH absorbers (with log$N$(OH)$>$13.6)\nto be $n_{\\rm OH}$ = $0.008^{+0.018}_{-0.008}$ at $z\\sim0.1$. Based on this we\nexpect to detect 10$^{+20}_{-10}$ such OH absorbers from the MeerKAT Absorption\nLine Survey. Using HI 21-cm and OH 1667 MHz absorption lines detected towards\nQ0248+430, we estimate ($\\Delta F/F$) = (5.2$\\pm$4.5)$\\times 10^{-6}$, where $F\n\\equiv g_p (\\alpha^2/\\mu)^{1.57}$, $\\alpha$ $-$ the fine structure constant,\n$\\mu$ $-$ the electron-proton mass ratio and $g_p$ $-$ the proton gyromagnetic\nratio. This corresponds to $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$($z=0.0519$) = (1.7 $\\pm$\n1.4)$\\times 10^{-6}$, which is among the stringent constraints on the\nfractional variation of $\\alpha$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 02:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Currently, the postprocessing mainly\ncontains four steps in the following order: sifting, parameter estimation,\ninformation reconciliation, and privacy amplification. For a quantum channel\nwith unknown prior characteristics, part of the raw keys (typically half) have\nto be sacrificed to estimate the channel parameters, which is used to assist in\nerror correction (part of information reconciliation) and estimate the secret\nkey rate. This introduces a tradeoff between the secret key rate and the\naccuracy of parameter estimation when considering the finite-size effect. In\nthis paper, we propose a high efficiency postprocessing method which uses all\nthe raw keys for both parameter estimation and key extraction. It is realized\nby exchanging the order of parameter estimation and information reconciliation,\nwhile the other steps remain unchanged. After the sifting step, the extra data\n(used for phase compensation and synchronization etc) can be used to roughly\nestimate the quantum channel parameters, or using the estimated results of last\nblock, thus the error correction can be realized normally. After the success of\nerror correction, the reconciler recovers the raw keys of the other side by a\nreverse mapping function. Then she uses all the raw keys of both sides for\nparameter estimation to estimate the quantum channel parameters and calculate\nthe secret key rate of the system. Finally, they perform the privacy\namplification step to obtain the unconditional security keys. We show that this\nmethod improves the accuracy of parameter estimation and the secret key rate of\ncontinuous-variable quantum key distribution system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 02:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

We approach this problem from\ndifferent perspectives and leverage existing results on monotone submodular\nmaximization to provide efficient approximation algorithms with performance\nguarantees. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated using the KITTI\nodometry benchmark dataset and synthetic Manhattan-like datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 04:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

It helps in identifying the various lithological and\nstratigraphical changes in reservoir properties. With the increase in the size\nof seismic data or number of attributes to be analyzed, the manual process for\nfacies identification becomes complicated and time-consuming. Even though\nseismic attributes add multiple dimensions to the data, their role in reservoir\ncharacterization is very crucial. There exist different linear transformation\nmethods that use seismic attributes for identification, characterization, and\nvisualization of seismic facies. These linear transformation methods have been\nwidely used for facies characterization.

However, in practice the method can only be\napplied for ideally smooth surfaces and thin films, not representative of real\nmaterial surfaces. Recently, micro-architected surfaces with nanometric\nfeatures have been proposed to mitigate SEE and ion-induced erosion in\nplasma-exposed thruster linings.

Actual surfaces are represented as a discrete finite element\nmeshes obtained from X-ray tomography images of tungsten nanofoams. At the\nlocal level, primary rays impinging into surface elements produce daughter rays\nof secondary electrons whose number, energies and angular characteristics are\nset by pre-calculated tables of SEE yields and energies from ideally-flat\nsurfaces.

Although recent advancements in microfluidic technology offer\nus useful lineage data, they are insufficient to directly identify the\nphenotypes of the cells.

However, much less attention has been paid to the effect of different\nnaturally occurring interstitials on the thermal and electrical properties of\nsilicon. In this work, we present a systematic study of the variability of heat\nand charge transport properties of bulk silicon, in the presence of randomly\ndistributed interstitial defects (Si, Ge, C and Li). We find through atomistic\nlattice dynamics and molecular dynamics modeling studies that, interstitial\ndefects scatter heat-carrying phonons to suppress thermal transport-1.56% of\nrandomly distributed Ge and Li interstitials reduce the thermal conductivity of\nsilicon by $\\sim$ 30 and 34 times, respectively.

Microlensing is known as the phenomenon in which luminosity\namplification appears when a bright object passes behind a black hole or\nanother massive object. We find that, for the braneworld black hole as well as\nfor the Ellis wormhole, there appears luminosity reduction just before and\nafter the amplification. This means that observation of such a reduction would\nindicate the lens object is either a braneworld black hole or a wormhole,\nthough it is difficult to distinguish one from the other by microlensing\nsolely. Therefore, we next analyze the optical images, or shadows of the\nbraneworld black hole surrounded by optically thin dust, and compare them to\nthose of the Ellis wormhole. Because the spacetime around the braneworld black\nhole possesses unstable circular orbits of photons, a bright ring appears in\nthe image, just as in Schwarzschild spacetime or in the wormhole spacetime.\nThis indicates that the appearance of a bright ring does not solely confirm a\nbraneworld black hole, a Schwarzschild, nor an Ellis wormhole. However, we find\nthat only for the wormhole is the intensity inside the ring larger than that\nthe outsider intensity. Therefore, with future high-resolution observations of\nmicrolensing and shadows together, we could identify the braneworld black holes\nif they exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 08:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

The flare was triggered by an emerging magnetic bipolar region that\nwas obliquely oriented with respect to the super-penumbral fibrils. The flare\nstarted due to the low height magnetic reconnection of emerging magnetic flux\nwith super-penumbral field resulting hot multi-temperature plasma flows in the\ninverse Evershed flow channel and its overlying atmosphere. The inverse\nEvershed flows in the chromosphere start from super penumbra towards sunspot\nthat end at the outer boundary of the penumbra. The hot plasma flow towards the\nsunspot in the inverse Evershed channels show about 10 km s$^{-1}$ higher\nvelocity in H$\\alpha$ wavelengths compared to the plasma emissions at various\ntemperatures as seen in different AIA filters. Even though these velocities are\nabout seven times higher than the typical inverse-Evershed flow speeds, the\nflow is diminished at the outer boundary of the sunspot's penumbra. This\nsuggests that the super-penumbral field lines that carry the inverse Evershed\nflows, are discontinued at the boundary where the penumbral field lines dive\ninto the sun and these two sets of field lines are completely distinct. The\ndiscontinuity in the typical magnetic field and plasma properties at the\nadjoining of these two sets of field lines further leads the discontinuity in\nthe characteristic magnetoacoustic and Alfv\\'en speeds, therefore, stopping the\nplasma flows further on. The multi-temperature plasma in the inverse Evershed\nchannels exhibits \\textbf{possible} longitudinal oscillations initially during\nthe onset of the flare, and later flows towards the sunspot.

Affective Video Content\nAnalysis (AVCA) attempts to generate a direct mapping between video content and\nthe corresponding affective states such as arousal and valence dimensions. Most\nexisting studies establish the mapping for each dimension separately using\nknowledge-based rules or traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine\n(SVM). The inherent correlations between affective dimensions have largely been\nunexploited, which are anticipated to include important information for\naccurate prediction of affective dimensions. To address this issue, this paper\npresents an approach to predict arousal and valance dimensions synchronously\nusing the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The approach extracts a set of\nlow-level audio and visual features from video data and projects them\nsynchronously into pairs of arousal and valence values using the LSTM network\nwhich automatically incorporates the correlations between arousal and valance\ndimensions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a dataset\ncomprising video clips segmented from real-world resources such as film, drama,\nand news, and demonstrate its superior performance over the traditional SVM\nbased method.

For example, the concentration of limiting substrate in the\nchemostat is independent of the concentration in the influx and only dependent\non the dilution rate and the strain parameters. Moreover, choosing optimal\noperational parameters (dilution rate, volume size, etc.) can be challenging.\nThere are conflicting requirements in the experimental design, such as a need\nfor relatively fast growth conditions for mutation accumulation on the one hand\nversus slow dilution for a large fitness advantage for mutants to take over the\npopulation quickly on the other.In this study, we provide analytic and\ncomputational tools to help understand and predict chemostat dynamics, and\nchoose suitable operational parameters.

It is based on a parametric model that describes the spectral\nproperties of the sounds of musical instruments independently of pitch. We\ndevelop a novel sparse pursuit algorithm that can match the discrete frequency\nspectra from the recorded signal with the continuous spectra delivered by the\nmodel. We first use this algorithm to convert an STFT spectrogram from the\nrecording into a novel form of log-frequency spectrogram whose resolution\nexceeds that of the mel spectrogram. We then make use of the pitch-invariant\nproperties of that representation in order to identify the sounds of the\ninstruments via the same sparse pursuit method. As the model parameters which\ncharacterize the musical instruments are not known beforehand, we train a\ndictionary that contains them, using a modified version of Adam. Applying the\nalgorithm on various audio samples, we find that it is capable of producing\nhigh-quality separation results when the model assumptions are satisfied and\nthe instruments are clearly distinguishable, but combinations of instruments\nwith similar spectral characteristics pose a conceptual difficulty. While a key\nfeature of the model is that it explicitly models inharmonicity, its presence\ncan also still impede performance of the sparse pursuit algorithm. In general,\ndue to its pitch-invariance, our method is especially suitable for dealing with\nspectra from acoustic instruments, requiring only a minimal number of\nhyperparameters to be preset. Additionally, we demonstrate that the dictionary\nthat is constructed for one recording can be applied to a different recording\nwith similar instruments without additional training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 10:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 12:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 14:20:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 17:48:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 19:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Operators of DNS recursive resolvers---the machines that\nreceive a client's query for a domain name and resolve it to a corresponding IP\naddress---can learn significant information about client activity. Past work,\nfor example, indicates that DNS queries reveal information ranging from web\nbrowsing activity to the types of devices that a user has in their home.\nRecognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries, various\nthird parties have created alternate DNS services that obscure a user's DNS\nqueries from his or her Internet service provider.

To this end, we present Oblivious DNS (ODNS), which introduces an\nadditional layer of obfuscation between clients and their queries. To do so,\nODNS uses its own authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the\nODNS namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they\nreceive, but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that initiated\nthese queries. We present an initial deployment of ODNS; our experiments show\nthat ODNS introduces minimal performance overhead, both for individual queries\nand for web page loads.

The topology of these\ndomain walls is then distinct from the uniformly magnetized state. When two\ndomain walls approach each other and are in close proximity they form winding\npairs, stabilized by a dipolar repulsion. This can result in the formation of\n360 {\\deg} stable domain walls, whose stability is directly related to the\nmagnitude of the additional dipolar interaction resulting from the spin\nstructure governed by the DMI. Application of an external magnetic field can\novercome the dipolar repulsion of the winding pairs and result in the\nannihilation of the domain walls, which is studied here in a combined\ntheoretical and experimental effort. We present an extended analytical model\nthat studies the interaction and modification of the dipolar interaction of the\ndomain wall pairs under the application of in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic\nfields.

We investigate how the final orbital\nparameters are influenced by the disc and planet masses. Using 2D, locally\nisothermal, viscous hydrodynamical simulations we first model the disc dynamics\nfor all five systems, followed by a study of the migration properties of\nembedded planets with different masses.

Phys.}\n{\\bf 2009}, 130, 054112] and tested on four sets of large organic molecules.\nCompared to existing functionals, TT-$\\omega$PBEh manages to provide more\naccurate predictions for key spectroscopic and photochemical observables,\nincluding but not limited to $E_{\\rm T}$, $E_{\\rm S}$, $\\Delta E_{\\rm ST}$, and\n$I$, as it adjusts the effective electron-hole interactions to arrive at the\ncorrect excitation energies. This promising triplet tuning scheme can be\napplied to a broad range of systems that were notorious in DFT for being\nextremely challenging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 12:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 19:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 23:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Of particular interest is to provide the significance of\nlow-dimensional wake flow features and their interaction dynamics to sustain\nthe free vibration of a square cylinder at a relatively low mass ratio. To\nobtain the high-dimensional data, we employ a body-conforming variational\nfluid-structure interaction solver based on the recently developed partitioned\niterative scheme and the dynamic subgrid-scale turbulence model for a moderate\nReynolds number. The snapshot data from high-dimensional FSI simulations are\nprojected to a low-dimensional subspace using the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD). We utilize each corresponding POD mode for detecting\nfeatures: the vortex street, the shear layer and the near-wake bubble. We find\nthat the vortex shedding modes contribute solely to the lift force, while the\nnear-wake and shear layer modes play a dominating role to the drag force. We\nfurther examine the fundamental mechanism of this dynamical behavior and\npropose a force decomposition technique via low-dimensional approximation. We\nascertain quantitatively that the shear layer feeds the vorticity flux to the\nwake vortices and the near-wake bubble during the wake-body synchronization.\nBased on the decomposition of wake dynamics, we suggest an interaction cycle\nfor the frequency lock-in during the wake-body interaction, which provides the\ninter-relationship between the high amplitude motion and the dominating wake\nfeatures. Through our investigation of wake-body synchronization below critical\nRe range, we discover that the bluff body can undergo a synchronized\nhigh-amplitude vibration due to flexibility-induced unsteadiness. The\ninteraction cycle for the wake-synchronization is found to be valid for the\nturbulent wake flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 15:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

In comparison to DNNs, humans show\nremarkable noise suppression capabilities that yield successful speech\nintelligibility under various adverse listening conditions and negative\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Motivated by the excellent human performance,\nthis paper explores whether numerical models that simulate human cochlear\nsignal processing can be combined with DNNs to improve the robustness of DNN\nbased noise suppression systems. Five cochlear models were coupled to\nfully-connected and recurrent NN-based noise suppression systems and were\ntrained and evaluated for a variety of noise conditions using objective\nmetrics: perceptual speech quality (PESQ), segmental SNR and cepstral distance.\nThe simulations show that biophysically-inspired cochlear models improve the\ngeneralizability of DNN-based noise suppression systems for unseen noise and\nnegative SNRs. This approach thus leads to robust noise suppression systems\nthat are less sensitive to the noise type and noise level. Because cochlear\nmodels capture the intrinsic nonlinearities and dynamics of peripheral auditory\nprocessing, it is shown here that accounting for their deterministic signal\nprocessing improves machine hearing and avoids overtraining of multi-layer\nDNNs. We hence conclude that machines hear better when realistic cochlear\nmodels are used at the input of DNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 15:44:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 16:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

However, the concept of a \"good\" community is very\ncontext-dependent and it is relatively complicated to deduce community\ncharacteristics using available community detection techniques. In reality, the\nexistence of a gap between structural goodness quality metrics and expected\ntopological patterns creates a confusion in evaluating community structures. In\nthis paper, we introduce an empirical multivariate analysis of different\nstructural goodness properties in order to characterize several detectable\ncommunity topologies. Specifically, we show that a combination of two\nrepresentative structural dimensions including community transitivity and hub\ndominance allows to distinguish different topologies such as star-based,\nclique-based, string-based and grid-based structures. Additionally, these\nclasses of topology disclose structural proximities with those of graphs\ncreated by Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi, Watts-Strogatz and Barab\\'{a}si-Albert\ngenerative models. We illustrate popular community topologies identified by\ndifferent detection methods on a large dataset composing many network\ncategories and associate their structures with the most related graph\ngenerative model. Interestingly, this conjunctive representation sheds light on\nfundamental differences between mesoscopic structures in various network\ncategories including: communication, information, biological, technological,\nsocial, ecological, synthetic networks and more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 10:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

An\nindirect adaptive fuzzy controller, resistant to parameter variations is then\nproposed. The general structure of the adaptive controller is specified in the\nfirst stage.

Its tendency to improve accuracy\nand speed up training have established BN as a favorite technique in deep\nlearning. Yet, despite its enormous success, there remains little consensus on\nthe exact reason and mechanism behind these improvements. In this paper we take\na step towards a better understanding of BN, following an empirical approach.\nWe conduct several experiments, and show that BN primarily enables training\nwith larger learning rates, which is the cause for faster convergence and\nbetter generalization. For networks without BN we demonstrate how large\ngradient updates can result in diverging loss and activations growing\nuncontrollably with network depth, which limits possible learning rates. BN\navoids this problem by constantly correcting activations to be zero-mean and of\nunit standard deviation, which enables larger gradient steps, yields faster\nconvergence and may help bypass sharp local minima. We further show various\nways in which gradients and activations of deep unnormalized networks are\nill-behaved.

Using a\ncombination of the multipole expansion and Faxen's theorems, we express the\nfrequency-dependent hydrodynamic mobility functions as a power series of the\nratio of the particle radius to the distance from the membrane for the self\nmobilities, and as a power series of the ratio of the radius to the\ninterparticle distance for the pair mobilities. In the quasi-steady limit of\nzero frequency, we find that the shear- and bending-related contributions to\nthe particle mobilities may have additive or suppressive effects depending on\nthe membrane properties in addition to the geometric configuration of the\ninteracting particles relative to the confining membrane. To elucidate the\neffect and role of the change of sign observed in the particle self and pair\nmobilities, we consider an example involving a torque-free doublet of\ncounterrotating particles near an elastic membrane. We find that the induced\nrotation rate of the doublet around its center of mass may differ in magnitude\nand direction depending on the membrane shear and bending properties. Near a\nmembrane of only energetic resistance toward shear deformation, such as that of\na certain type of elastic capsules, the doublet undergoes rotation of the same\nsense as observed near a no-slip wall. Near a membrane of only energetic\nresistance toward bending, such as that of a fluid vesicle, we find a reversed\nsense of rotation.
