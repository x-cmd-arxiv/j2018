Near-IR photometric monitoring was performed in May\n2008 over a period of three nights at Magellan using PANIC. We obtain J, H and\nK lightcurves of Cen X-4 using differential photometry. An ellipsoidal modeling\ncode was used to fit the phase folded light curves. The lightcurve fit which\nmakes the least assumptions about the properties of the binary system yields an\ninclination of 34.9 (+4.9, -3.6) degrees, which is consistent with previous\ndeterminations of the system's inclination but with improved statistical\nuncertainties. When combined with the mass function and mass ratio, this\ninclination yields a neutron star mass of 1.51 (+0.40, -0.55) M_sun. This model\nallows accretion disk parameters to be free in the fitting process. Fits that\ndo not allow for an accretion disk component in the near-IR flux gives a\nsystematically lower inclination between approximately 33 and 34 degrees,\nleading to a higher mass neutron star between approximately 1.7 M_sun and 1.8\nM_sun. We discuss the implications of other assumptions made during the\nmodeling process as well as numerous free parameters and their effects on the\nresulting inclination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 16:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

To understand the\ndanger of overfitting, we measure the accuracy of CIFAR-10 classifiers by\ncreating a new test set of truly unseen images. Although we ensure that the new\ntest set is as close to the original data distribution as possible, we find a\nlarge drop in accuracy (4% to 10%) for a broad range of deep learning models.\nYet more recent models with higher original accuracy show a smaller drop and\nbetter overall performance, indicating that this drop is likely not due to\noverfitting based on adaptivity. Instead, we view our results as evidence that\ncurrent accuracy numbers are brittle and susceptible to even minute natural\nvariations in the data distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 17:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

The need for large DL surveys of\ntargets with high sky density motivates a desire for simultaneous speckle\nimaging over large FOVs, however it is currently impractical to attain this by\ncovering the entire focal plane with fast readout detectors. An alternative\napproach is to connect a relatively small number of detector pixels to multiple\ninteresting targets spanning a large FOV through the use of optical fibers, a\ntechnique employed in spectroscopy for decades.

Outsourcing large-scale matrix multiplication tasks to multiple\ndistributed servers or cloud is desirable to speed up computation. However,\nsecurity becomes an issue when these servers are untrustworthy. In this paper,\nwe study the problem of secure distributed matrix multiplication from\ndistributed untrustworthy servers. This problem falls in the category of secure\nfunction computation and has received significant attention in the cryptography\ncommunity. However, the fundamental limits of information-theoretically secure\nmatrix multiplication remain an open problem. We focus on\ninformation-theoretically secure distributed matrix multiplication with the\ngoal of characterizing the minimum communication overhead. The capacity of\nsecure matrix multiplication is defined as the maximum possible ratio of the\ndesired information and the total communication received from $N$ distributed\nservers. In particular, we study the following two models where we want to\nmultiply two matrices $A\\in\\mathbb{F}^{m\\times n}$ and $B\\in\\mathbb{F}^{n\\times\np}$: $(a)$ one-sided secure matrix multiplication with $\\ell$ colluding\nservers, in which $B$ is a public matrix available at all servers and $A$ is a\nprivate matrix. $(b)$ fully secure matrix multiplication with $\\ell$ colluding\nservers, in which both $A$ and $B$ are private matrices. The goal is to\nsecurely multiply $A$ and $B$ when any $\\ell$ servers can collude. For model\n$(a)$, we characterize the capacity as\n$C_{\\text{one-sided}}^{(\\ell)}=(N-\\ell)/N$ by providing a secure matrix\nmultiplication scheme and a matching converse. For model $(b)$, we propose a\nnovel scheme that lower bounds the capacity, i.e.,\n$C_{\\text{fully}}^{(\\ell)}\\geq (\\lceil \\sqrt{N}-\\ell \\rceil)^2/(\\lceil\n\\sqrt{N}-\\ell \\rceil+\\ell)^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 17:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-04"}

More generally, we\nexamine the likelihood and consequences of Earth having prior moons, and find\nthat the stability of moonlets against disruption by subsequent impacts implies\nthat several large impacts could post-date Moon formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 18:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The high\nionization potential of neutral helium atoms makes it difficult to build\nefficient detectors. Therefore, it is important to develop beam sources with a\nhigh centre line intensity. Several approaches for predicting the centre line\nintensity exist, with the quitting surface model incorporating the largest\namount of physical dependencies. However, until now only a limited amount of\nexperimental data has been available. Here we present a study where we compare\nthe quitting surface model with an extensive set of experimental data. In the\nquitting surface model the source is described as a sphere from where the\nparticles leave in a molecular flow determined by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.\nWe use numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation to determine its\nproperties. The centre-line intensity is then calculated using an analytical\nintegral. This integral can be reduced to two cases, one which assumes a\ncontinuously expanding beam until the skimmer aperture, and another which\nassumes a quitting surface placed before the aperture. We compare the two cases\nto experimental data with a nozzle diameter of 10 micron, skimmer diameters\nranging from 4 micron to 390 micron, a source pressure range from 2 to 190 bar,\nand nozzle-skimmer distances between 17.3 mm and 5.3 mm. To support the two\nanalytical approaches, we have also performed equivalent ray tracing\nsimulations. We conclude that the quitting surface model predicts the centre\nline intensity well for skimmers with a diameter larger than 120 micron when\nusing a beam expanding until the skimmer aperture. For the case of smaller\nskimmers the trend is correct, but the absolute agreement not as good.

Our method combines a primal first-order method\nwith a dual optimality certificate search, which when successful, allows for\nearly termination of the primal method. We show for certain variable clustering\nproblems that, with high probability, FORCE is guaranteed to find the optimal\nsolution to the SDP relaxation and provide a certificate of exact optimality.\nAs verified by our numerical experiments, this allows FORCE to solve the P-W\nSDP with dimensions in the hundreds in only tens of seconds. For a variation of\nthe P-W SDP where $K$ is not known a priori a slight modification of FORCE\nreduces the computational complexity of solving this problem as well: from\n$\\tilde{O}(d^7\\log\\epsilon^{-1})$ using a standard SDP solver to\n$\\tilde{O}(d^{4}\\epsilon^{-1})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 20:01:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 16:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 03:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

Recently, concerns have been raised about\nwhether the process of exploration could be viewed as unfair, placing too much\nburden on certain individuals or groups. Motivated by these concerns, we\ninitiate the study of the externalities of exploration - the undesirable side\neffects that the presence of one party may impose on another - under the linear\ncontextual bandits model. We introduce the notion of a group externality,\nmeasuring the extent to which the presence of one population of users impacts\nthe rewards of another. We show that this impact can in some cases be negative,\nand that, in a certain sense, no algorithm can avoid it. We then study\nexternalities at the individual level, interpreting the act of exploration as\nan externality imposed on the current user of a system by future users. This\ndrives us to ask under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes\nexplicit exploration unnecessary. We build on a recent line of work on the\nsmoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm that always chooses the action that\ncurrently looks optimal, improving on prior results to show that a greedy\napproach almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other\nalgorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold,\nand that this regret is at most $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/3})$. Returning to group-level\neffects, we show that under the same conditions, negative group externalities\nessentially vanish under the greedy algorithm.

Historically,\nmulti-atlas segmentation (MAS) has been regarded as the de facto standard\nmethod for whole brain segmentation. Recently, deep neural network approaches\nhave been applied to whole brain segmentation by learning random patches or 2D\nslices. Yet, few previous efforts have been made on detailed whole brain\nsegmentation using 3D networks due to the following challenges: (1) fitting\nentire whole brain volume into 3D networks is restricted by the current GPU\nmemory, and (2) the large number of targeting labels (e.g., > 100 labels) with\nlimited number of training 3D volumes (e.g., < 50 scans). In this paper, we\npropose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to\ndistribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks to cover\noverlapped sub-spaces in a standard atlas space. This strategy simplifies the\nwhole brain learning task to localized sub-tasks, which was enabled by combing\ncanonical registration and label fusion techniques with deep learning. To\naddress the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled\nscans were created by MAS for pre-training.

The ubiquitous tools of cross-validation (CV) and the bootstrap are\nexamples of this technique. These methods are powerful in large part due to\ntheir model agnosticism but can be slow to run on modern, large data sets due\nto the need to repeatedly re-fit the model. In this work, we use a linear\napproximation to the dependence of the fitting procedure on the weights,\nproducing results that can be faster than repeated re-fitting by an order of\nmagnitude. This linear approximation is sometimes known as the \"infinitesimal\njackknife\" in the statistics literature, where it is mostly used as a\ntheoretical tool to prove asymptotic results. We provide explicit finite-sample\nerror bounds for the infinitesimal jackknife in terms of a small number of\nsimple, verifiable assumptions.

But these approaches struggle on sparse-reward domains\nlike Montezuma's Revenge where the probability that any random action sequence\nleads to reward is extremely low. Recent algorithms have performed well on such\ntasks by encouraging agents to visit new states or perform new actions in\nrelation to all prior training episodes (which we call across-training\nnovelty). But such algorithms do not consider whether an agent exhibits\nintra-life novelty: doing something new within the current episode, regardless\nof whether those behaviors have been performed in previous episodes. We\nhypothesize that across-training novelty might discourage agents from\nrevisiting initially non-rewarding states that could become important stepping\nstones later in training. We introduce Deep Curiosity Search (DeepCS), which\nencourages intra-life exploration by rewarding agents for visiting as many\ndifferent states as possible within each episode, and show that DeepCS matches\nthe performance of current state-of-the-art methods on Montezuma's Revenge. We\nfurther show that DeepCS improves exploration on Amidar, Freeway, Gravitar, and\nTutankham (many of which are hard exploration games). Surprisingly, DeepCS\ndoubles A2C performance on Seaquest, a game we would not have expected to\nbenefit from intra-life exploration because the arena is small and already\neasily navigated by naive exploration techniques. In one run, DeepCS achieves a\nmaximum training score of 80,000 points on Seaquest, higher than any methods\nother than Ape-X. The strong performance of DeepCS on these sparse- and\ndense-reward tasks suggests that encouraging intra-life novelty is an\ninteresting, new approach for improving performance in Deep RL and motivates\nfurther research into hybridizing across-training and intra-life exploration\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 22:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 17:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 00:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

Phys., 311 (2016), 258--274] that utilizes a\nspecialized quadrature in the boundary region for a high-order treatment of the\nmaterial interface. In this text, we present a solution framework that relies\non the specialized boundary integrator to enhance the convergence rate of other\nfast, low order methodologies without adding to their computational complexity\nof $O(N \\log N)$ for an $N$-point discretization. In particular, to demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the proposed framework, we explain its implementation to\nenhance the order to convergence of two schemes, one introduced by Duan and\nRokhlin [J. Comput. Phys., 228(6) (2009), 2152--2174] that is based on a\npre-corrected trapezoidal rule while the other by Bruno and Hyde [J. Comput.\nPhys., 200(2) (2004), 670--694] which relies on a suitable decomposition of the\nGreen's function via Addition theorem. In addition to a detailed description of\nthese methodologies, we also present a comparative performance study of the\nimproved versions of these two and the Nystr\\\"{o}m solver in [J. Comput. Phys.,\n311 (2016), 258--274] through a wide range of numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2018 01:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

A lifetime of 3.3(2) ns for the\nz5D0 level is used based on LIF measurements for lifetimes of the four other\nlevels in the z5D term. Twelve of the 84 lines are weak transitions connecting\nto the ground and low metastable levels of Co+. Another 46 lines are strong\ntransitions connecting to the ground and low metastable levels of Co+. For\nthese lines log(gf) values were measured in earlier studies and, with a few\nexceptions, are confirmed in this study. Such lines, if unblended in stellar\nspectra, have the potential to yield Co abundance values unaffected by any\nbreakdown of the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium approximation in stellar\nphotospheres because the ground and low metastable levels of Co+ are the\nprimary population reservoirs of Co in photospheres of interest. Weak lines, if\nunblended, are useful in photospheres with high Co abundance and strong lines\nare useful in metal-poor photospheres. New hyperfine structure A constants for\n28 levels of ionized Co from least square fits to Fourier transform spectra\nline profiles are reported. These laboratory data are applied to re-determine\nthe Co abundance in metal-poor halo star HD 84937.

In this\npaper, we present a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach for\nsegmentation tasks by designing semantic-aware generative adversarial networks\n(GANs). Specifically, we transform the test image into the appearance of source\ndomain, with the semantic structural information being well preserved, which is\nachieved by imposing a nested adversarial learning in semantic label space. In\nthis way, the segmentation DNN learned from the source domain is able to be\ndirectly generalized to the transformed test image, eliminating the need of\ntraining a new model for every new target dataset. Our domain adaptation\nprocedure is unsupervised, without using any target domain labels. The\nadversarial learning of our network is guided by a GAN loss for mapping data\ndistributions, a cycle-consistency loss for retaining pixel-level content, and\na semantic-aware loss for enhancing structural information. We validated our\nmethod on two different chest X-ray public datasets for left/right lung\nsegmentation.

This is a well-known sociological phenomenon observed in employment,\nresidence, addiction, criminal activity, wars, etc. Fundamentally, these all\nexhibit a growing resistance to change over time. However, quantifying the\nstrength of this inertia is an ongoing challenge. Here we uncover anomalous\ncumulative inertia (ACI), ubiquitous across human behavioural patterns, with a\nmuch stronger memory dependence than previously anticipated. The behaviours\nundergo substantially stronger inertia, invalidating classical predictions for\nrecovery, reconciliation, or rehabilitation times. We propose alternative\nmodels for predictions of continued anomalous behaviour, and provide means of\nidentifying whether such behaviour is present.

As an athermal system, the overall\ndensities are the only control parameters. As the densities increase, an\nentropically driven phase transition occurs, leading to ordered states with A-\nand B-rich domains separated by hole-rich interfaces. Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we analyze the effect of imposing a drive on this system, biasing\nparticle moves along one direction. Our study parallels that for a driven Ising\nlattice gas -- the Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn (KLS) model, which displays atypical\ncollective behavior, e.g., structure factors with discontinuity singularities\nand ordered states with domains only parallel to the drive. Here, other novel\nfeatures emerge, including structure factors with kink singularities (best\nfitted to |q|), maxima at non-vanishing wavevector values, oscillating\ncorrelation functions, and ordering into multiple striped domains perpendicular\nto the drive, with a preferred wavelength depending on density and drive\nintensity. Moreover, the (hole-rich) interfaces between the domains are\nstatistically rough (whether driven or not), in sharp contrast with those in\nthe KLS model, in which the drive suppresses interfacial roughness. Defining a\nnovel order parameter (to account for the emergence of multistripe states), we\nmap out the phase diagram in the density-drive plane and present preliminary\nevidence for a critical phase in this driven lattice gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2018 14:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

How can we discover new attribute values that we have\nnever seen before?

A wealth of information regarding\nintelligent decision making is conveyed by human gaze allocation; hence,\nexploiting such information has the potential to improve the agents'\nperformance. With this motivation, we propose the AGIL (Attention Guided\nImitation Learning) framework. We collect high-quality human action and gaze\ndata while playing Atari games in a carefully controlled experimental setting.\nUsing these data, we first train a deep neural network that can predict human\ngaze positions and visual attention with high accuracy (the gaze network) and\nthen train another network to predict human actions (the policy network).\nIncorporating the learned attention model from the gaze network into the policy\nnetwork significantly improves the action prediction accuracy and task\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 18:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

Learning a good inverse mapping from\ntraining data faces severe challenges, including: (i) scarcity of training\ndata; (ii) need for plausible reconstructions that are physically feasible;\n(iii) need for fast reconstruction, especially in real-time applications. We\ndevelop a successful system solving all these challenges, using as basic\narchitecture the recurrent application of proximal gradient algorithm. We learn\na proximal map that works well with real images based on residual networks.\nContraction of the resulting map is analyzed, and incoherence conditions are\ninvestigated that drive the convergence of the iterates. Extensive experiments\nare carried out under different settings: (a) reconstructing abdominal MRI of\npediatric patients from highly undersampled Fourier-space data and (b)\nsuperresolving natural face images. Our key findings include: 1. a recurrent\nResNet with a single residual block unrolled from an iterative algorithm yields\nan effective proximal which accurately reveals MR image details. 2. Our\narchitecture significantly outperforms conventional non-recurrent deep ResNets\nby 2dB SNR; it is also trained much more rapidly. 3. It outperforms\nstate-of-the-art compressed-sensing Wavelet-based methods by 4dB SNR, with 100x\nspeedups in reconstruction time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 21:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

Using an intrinsic degree of freedom which\ndescribes the coupling of a variable cosmological term $\\Lambda$ with\nnon-relativistic matter and radiation, the following consequences are\ndemonstrated by coupling only a small contribution of $\\Lambda$ with\nnon-relativistic matter. First, the standard model of cosmology with a positive\ncosmological constant can be generalised such that the missing mass problem of\ndark matter is solved by an overall negative variable cosmological term.\nSecond, the model under consideration is compatible with constraints from the\nstandard model of particle physics. Third, an equation of state parameter of\ndark matter is derived which agrees with observations of rotational curves of\ngalaxies. Moreover, the creation and annihilation process of dark matter is\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2018 11:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

In this work, we propose a new drowsiness state detection system based\non physiological signals and eye blinking. An experiment has been directed to\njustify the utility of the proposed approach. This system uses a smart video\ncamera that takes drivers faces images and supervises the eye blink (open and\nclose); also, it uses the Emotiv EPOC headset to acquire the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) signals.
