Here $\\mathscr{O}$ can be the ring of smooth, holomorphic,\nor real analytic functions. The choices entering the construction of this Lie\n$\\infty$-algebroid, including the chosen underlying resolution, are unique up\nto homotopy and, moreover, every other Lie $\\infty$-algebroid inducing the same\nfoliation or any of its sub-foliations factorizes through it in an\nup-to-homotopy unique manner. We thus call it the universal Lie\n$\\infty$-algebroid of the singular foliation. For real analytic or holomorphic\nsingular foliations, it can be chosen, locally, to be a Lie $n$-algebroid for\nsome finite $n$. We show that this universal structure encodes several aspects\nof the geometry of the leaves of a singular foliation. In particular, it\ncontains the holonomy algebroid and groupoid of a leaf in the sense of\nAndroulidakis and Skandalis. But even more, each leaf carries an isotropy\n$L_\\infty$-algebra structure that is unique up to isomorphism. It extends a\nminimal isotropy Lie algebra, that can be associated to each leaf, by higher\nbrackets, which give rise to additional invariants of the foliation. As a\nbyproduct, we construct an example of a foliation generated by $r$ vector\nfields for which we show by these techniques that it cannot be generated by the\nimage through the anchor map of a Lie algebroid of the minimal rank $r$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2018 16:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

When uncertain of the point\nprocess, one would like to find a robust clusterer that is optimal over the\nuncertainty, just as one may find optimal robust classifiers with uncertain\nfeature-label distributions. Herein, we derive an optimal robust clusterer by\nfirst finding an effective random point process that incorporates all\nrandomness within its own probabilistic structure and from which a Bayes\nclusterer can be derived that provides an optimal robust clusterer relative to\nthe uncertainty. This is analogous to the use of effective class-conditional\ndistributions in robust classification. After evaluating the performance of\nrobust clusterers in synthetic mixtures of Gaussians models, we apply the\nframework to granular imaging, where we make use of the asymptotic\ngranulometric moment theory for granular images to relate robust clustering\ntheory to the application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2018 17:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Objective: Our objective is to summarize the\nstate-of-the-art in NLP-assisted software testing which could benefit\npractitioners to potentially utilize those NLP-based techniques. Moreover, this\ncan benefit researchers in providing an overview of the research landscape.\nMethod: To address the above need, we conducted a survey in the form of a\nsystematic literature mapping (classification). After compiling an initial pool\nof 95 papers, we conducted a systematic voting, and our final pool included 67\ntechnical papers. Results: This review paper provides an overview of the\ncontribution types presented in the papers, types of NLP approaches used to\nassist software testing, types of required input requirements, and a review of\ntool support in this area.

Here we\nfocus on quantifying the quantumness of experimentally-observed neutrino\noscillation, using the tools of recently-developed quantum resource theory. We\nanalyzed ensembles of reactor and accelerator neutrinos at distinct energies\nfrom a variety of neutrino sources, including Daya Bay (0.5 km and 1.6 km),\nKamland (180 km), MINOS (735 km), and T2K (295 km).

This is possible because individual\ngroup members repeatedly adjust their position and motion in response to the\nposition and motion of other group members. Here we develop a theoretical\napproach to address the question, what general features -- if any -- underlie\nthe interaction rules that mediate group stability in animals of all species?\nWe do so by considering how the spatial organisation of a group would change in\nthe complete absence of interactions. Without interactions, a group would\ndisperse in a way that can be easily characterised in terms of Fick's diffusion\nequations. We can hence address the inverse theoretical problem of finding the\nindividual-level interaction responses that are required to counterbalance\ndiffusion and to preserve group stability. We show that an individual-level\nresponse to neighbour densities in the form of Weber's law (a 'universal' law\ndescribing the functioning of the sensory systems of animals of all species)\nresults in an 'anti-diffusion' term at the group level. On short time scales,\nthis anti-diffusion restores the initial group configuration in a way which is\nreminiscent of methods for image deblurring in image processing. We also show\nthat any non-homogeneous, spatial density distribution can be preserved over\ntime if individual movement patterns have the form of a Weber's law response.\nWeber's law describes the fundamental functioning of perceptual systems.

With tremendous images uploaded everyday,\nunderstanding users' preferences on user-generated images and making\nrecommendations have become an urgent need. In fact, many hybrid models have\nbeen proposed to fuse various kinds of side information~(e.g., image visual\nrepresentation, social network) and user-item historical behavior for enhancing\nrecommendation performance. However, due to the unique characteristics of the\nuser generated images in social image platforms, the previous studies failed to\ncapture the complex aspects that influence users' preferences in a unified\nframework. Moreover, most of these hybrid models relied on predefined weights\nin combining different kinds of information, which usually resulted in\nsub-optimal recommendation performance. To this end, in this paper, we develop\na hierarchical attention model for social contextual image recommendation. In\naddition to basic latent user interest modeling in the popular matrix\nfactorization based recommendation, we identify three key aspects (i.e., upload\nhistory, social influence, and owner admiration) that affect each user's latent\npreferences, where each aspect summarizes a contextual factor from the complex\nrelationships between users and images. After that, we design a hierarchical\nattention network that naturally mirrors the hierarchical relationship\n(elements in each aspects level, and the aspect level) of users' latent\ninterests with the identified key aspects. Specifically, by taking embeddings\nfrom state-of-the-art deep learning models that are tailored for each kind of\ndata, the hierarchical attention network could learn to attend differently to\nmore or less content.

To solve this constrained optimization problem,\nour method employs Lagrange multipliers that act as integrators of error over\ntraining and identify `support vector'-like examples.

With deceptive words, people can get infected by the fake\nnews very easily and will share them without any fact-checking. For instance,\nduring the 2016 US president election, various kinds of fake news about the\ncandidates widely spread through both official news media and the online social\nnetworks. These fake news is usually released to either smear the opponents or\nsupport the candidate on their side. The erroneous information in the fake news\nis usually written to motivate the voters' irrational emotion and enthusiasm.\nSuch kinds of fake news sometimes can bring about devastating effects, and an\nimportant goal in improving the credibility of online social networks is to\nidentify the fake news timely. In this paper, we propose to study the fake news\ndetection problem. Automatic fake news identification is extremely hard, since\npure model based fact-checking for news is still an open problem, and few\nexisting models can be applied to solve the problem. With a thorough\ninvestigation of a fake news data, lots of useful explicit features are\nidentified from both the text words and images used in the fake news. Besides\nthe explicit features, there also exist some hidden patterns in the words and\nimages used in fake news, which can be captured with a set of latent features\nextracted via the multiple convolutional layers in our model. A model named as\nTI-CNN (Text and Image information based Convolutinal Neural Network) is\nproposed in this paper. By projecting the explicit and latent features into a\nunified feature space, TI-CNN is trained with both the text and image\ninformation simultaneously.

This is particularly true for\nprocessing natural graphs.\n  In this paper, we have the insight that the atomic operations for the vertex\nupdating of many graph algorithms (e.g., BFS, PageRank and WCC) are typically\nincremental and simplex. This hence allows us to parallelize the conflicting\nvertex updates in an accumulative manner. We architect a novel graphspecific\naccelerator that can simultaneously process atomic vertex updates for massive\nparallelism on the conflicting data access while ensuring the correctness. A\nparallel accumulator is designed to remove the serialization in atomic\nprotection for conflicting vertex updates through merging their results in\nparallel.

Our approach performs a series of soft attention operations,\neach time casting a scalar feature upon the inner word embeddings. The key idea\nis to provide a real-valued hint (feature) to a subsequent encoder layer and is\ntargeted at improving the representation learning process. There are several\nadvantages to this design, e.g., it allows an arbitrary number of attention\nmechanisms to be casted, allowing for multiple attention types (e.g.,\nco-attention, intra-attention) and attention variants (e.g., alignment-pooling,\nmax-pooling, mean-pooling) to be executed simultaneously.

It is essential to improve DRAM\ncache hit rate and lower cache hit latency simultaneously. Prior DRAM cache\ndesigns fall into two categories according to the data mapping polices:\nset-associative and direct-mapped, achieving either one. In this paper, we\npropose a partial direct-mapped die-stacked DRAM cache to achieve the both\nobjectives simultaneously, called Gemini, which is motivated by the following\nobservations: applying unified mapping policy to different blocks cannot\nachieve high cache hit rate and low hit latency in terms of mapping structure.\nGemini cache classifies data into leading blocks and following blocks, and\nplaces them with static mapping and dynamic mapping respectively in a unified\nset-associative structure. Gemini also designs a replacement policy to balance\nthe different blocks miss penalty and the recency, and provides strategies to\nmitigate cache thrashing due to block type transitions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that Gemini cache can narrow the hit latency gap with direct-mapped\ncache significantly, from 1.75X to 1.22X on average, and can achieve comparable\nhit rate with set-associative cache.

The number of\nexpressed phenotypes and thus the rate of interaction is an evolvable trait.\nOur results show that nonnegligible cost of expressing phenotypes restrains\nphenotype expression, and the evolutionary race mainly proceeds on between\ncooperative strains and defective strains who express a very few phenotypes. It\npays for cooperative strains to express a very few phenotypes. Though such a\nlow level of expression weakens reciprocity between cooperative strains, it\ndecelerates rate of interaction between cooperative strains and defective\nstrains to a larger degree, leading to the predominance of cooperative strains\nover defective strains. We also find that evolved diversity of phenotype\nexpression can occasionally destabilize due to the invasion of defective\nmutants, implying that cooperation and diversity of phenotype expression can\nmutually reinforce each other. Therefore, our results provide new insights into\nbetter understanding the coevolution of cooperation and the diversity of\nphenotype expression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2018 12:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

Speechreading is commonly used by people with\nall severities of hearing loss to understand speech, and people with typical\nhearing also speechread (albeit subconsciously) to help them understand others.\nHowever, speechreading is a skill that takes considerable practice to acquire.\nPublicly-funded speechreading classes are sometimes provided, and have been\nshown to improve speechreading acquisition.

Towards channel estimators that are both\nefficient and require low-training overhead, compressive sensing (CS)\napproaches have been increasingly popular, exploiting the sparse nature of the\nphysical channel. However, no analytical insights regarding the overhead\nrequired for reliable channel estimation in wideband massive MIMO are\navailable. By observing that the wideband massive MIMO channel can be\nrepresented by a vector that is not simply sparse but has well defined\nstructural properties, referred to as hierarchical sparsity, we propose low\ncomplexity channel estimators for the multiuser scenario that take this\nproperty into account. By employing the framework of the hierarchical\nrestricted isometry property, rigorous performance guarantees for these\nalgorithms are provided suggesting concrete design goals for the user pilot\nsequences. For a specific design, we analytically characterize the scaling of\nthe required pilot overhead with increasing number of antennas and bandwidth,\nrevealing that, as long as the number of antennas is sufficiently large, it is\nindependent of the per user channel sparsity level as well as the number of\nactive users. Hence, surprisingly, in contrast to the classical setting, pilot\noverhead can be shifted into spatial dimensions not affecting crucial bandwidth\nconstraints thereby increasing the overall system capacity.

If no restrictions existed regarding the concentration and permanence\nof negative energy regions, it might, for example, be possible to produce\nexotic phenomena such as Lorentzian transversable wormholes, warp drives, time\nmachines, violations of the second law of thermodynamics, and naked\nsingularities. Quantum Inequalities (QIs) have been proposed that restrict the\nsize and duration of the regions of negative quantum vacuum energy that can be\naccessed by observers. However, QIs generally are derived for situations in\ncosmology and are very difficult to test. Direct measurement of vacuum energy\nis difficult and to date no QI has been tested experimentally. We test a\nproposed QI for squeezed light by a meta-analysis of published data obtained\nfrom experiments with optical parametric amplifiers (OPA) and balanced homodyne\ndetection. Over that last three decades, researchers in quantum optics have\nbeen trying to maximize the squeezing of light and the quantum vacuum and have\nsucceeded in reducing the variance in the quantum vacuum fluctuations to -15\ndB. To apply the QI, a time sampling function is required. In our meta-analysis\ndifferent time sampling functions for the QI were examined, but in all\nphysically reasonable cases the QI is violated by much or all of the measured\ndata. This brings into question the basis for QI. Possible explanations are\ngiven for this surprising result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2018 01:37:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 16:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}
