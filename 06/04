One of the tasks involves picking up critical\nresources (e.g., first aid kits, blankets, water) from warehouses and\ndelivering them to the affected people. To successfully deliver these items to\nthe people in need, the organization needs to make decisions that range from\nthe quick acquisition of vehicles from the local market, to the preparation of\npickup and delivery schedules and vehicle routes. During crises, the supply of\nvehicles is often limited, their acquisition cost is steep, and special rental\nperiods are imposed. At the same time, the affected area needs the aid\nmaterials as fast as possible, and deliveries must be made within due time.\nTherefore, it is imperative that the decisions of acquiring, scheduling, and\nrouting of vehicles are made optimally and quickly.

In this instance, we consider\nthe case of concurrent sets. A set is a collection of elements, where the\nelements are ordered and distinct. These two invariants are always maintained\nat every point in time. Currently, multiple implementations of concurrent sets\nalready exist. LazyList, Hand-over-hand List and Harris List are some of the\nwell-known implementations. However none of these implementations employ, or\nare concerned with garbage collection of deleted nodes. Instead each\nimplementation ignores deleted nodes or depends on the garbage collector of the\nlanguage to handle them. Additionally, Garbage collection in concurrent lists,\nthat use optimistic traversals or that are lock-free, is not trivial. For\nexample, in LazyList and Harris List, they allow a thread to traverse a node or\na sequence of nodes after these nodes have already been removed from the list,\nand hence possibly deleted. If deleted nodes are to be reused, this will\npotentially lead to the ABA problem. Moreover, some languages like C++ do not\nhave an inbuilt garbage collector. Some constructs like Shared Pointers provide\na limited garbage collection facility, but it degrades performance by a large\nscale.

The magnetic field along which a jet emerges is often\nopen to interplanetary space, offering a clear \"escape route\" for any\nflare-accelerated electrons and making jets lucrative targets for studying\nparticle acceleration and the solar sources of transient heliospheric events.\nBremsstrahlung hard X-rays (HXRs) could, in principle, trace the accelerated\nelectrons that escape along the paths of the jets, but measurements of the\nescaping electron beams are customarily difficult due to the low densities of\nthe corona. In this work, we augment HXR observations with gyrosynchrotron\nemission observed in microwaves, as well as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission\nand modeling to investigate flare-accelerated electrons in a coronal jet. HXR\nand microwave data from RHESSI and OVSA, respectively, give complementary\ninsight into electron spectra and locations, including the presence of\naccelerated electrons in the jet itself. High-time-resolution HXR data from the\nKonus-Wind instrument suggest electron acceleration timescales on the order of\n1 second or shorter. We model the energetic electron distributions in the GX\nSimulator framework using SoHO/MDI, RHESSI, TRACE, and OVSA data as\nconstraints. The result is a modeled distribution, informed and constrained by\nmeasurements, of accelerated electrons as they escape the Sun. Combining the\ndetection of microwave gyrosynchrotron emission from an open, rather than\nclosed, magnetic configuration, with realistic 3D modeling constrained by\nmagnetograms, EUV, and X-ray emission, we obtain the most stringent constraints\nto date on the accelerated electrons within a solar jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2018 19:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 03:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

The Ising models consist of\nrepeated uniform horizontal strips of width $m$ connected by sequences of\nvertical strings of length $n$ mutually separated by distance $N$, with $N=1,2$\nand $3$. We find that the critical temperature $T_c(N,m,n)$, arising from the\ncollective effects, decreases as $n$ and $N$ increase, and increases as $m$\nincreases, as it should be. The amplitude $A(N,m,n)$ of the logarithmic\ndivergence at the bulk critical temperature $T_c(N,m,n)$ becomes smaller as $n$\nand $m$ increase. A rounded peak, with size of order $\\ln m$ and signifying the\none-dimensional behavior of strips of finite width $m$, appears when $n$ is\nlarge enough. The appearance of these rounded peaks does not depend on $m$ as\nmuch, but depends rather more on $N$ and $n$, which is rather perplexing.\nMoreover, for fixed $m$ and $n$, the specific heats are not much different for\ndifferent $N$. This is a most surprising result. For $N=1$, the spin-spin\ncorrelation in the center row of each strip can be written as a Toeplitz\ndeterminant with a generating function which is much more complicated than in\nOnsager's Ising model.

The framework is\nbased on the principle of `causal sufficiency': that it should be possible to\nmake inferences about interventions using only the probabilities from a single\n`reference experiment' plus causal structure in the form of a DAG. This leads\nto several interesting results: we find that quantum measurements deserve a\nspecial status distinct from interventions, and that a special rule is needed\nfor making inferences about what would happen if they are not performed\n(`un-measurements'). One natural candidate for this rule is found to be an\nequation of importance to the QBist interpretation of quantum mechanics. We\nfind that the causal structure of quantum systems must have a `layered'\nstructure, and that the model can naturally be made symmetric under reversal of\nthe causal arrows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2018 23:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 19:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 22:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 13:01:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 05:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

While this channel has been heavily characterized through structural\nmethods, electrophysiology, and theoretical modeling, our understanding of its\nphysiological role in preventing cell death by alleviating high membrane\ntension remains tenuous. In this work, we examine the contribution of MscL\nalone to cell survival after osmotic shock at single cell resolution using\nquantitative fluorescence microscopy. We conduct these experiments in an E.\ncoli strain which is lacking all mechanosensitive channel genes save for MscL\nwhose expression is tuned across three orders of magnitude through\nmodifications of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.

This number agrees with the average\nMscL copy number measured in wild-type E. coli cells through proteomic studies\nand quantitative Western blotting. Furthermore, we observe zero survival events\nin cells with less than 100 channels per cell.

Based\non this, a graph processing method for graph structure analysis is proposed in\nthis paper: (1) This paper calculates the vertex activity of a graph according\nto the in-degree and out-degree, and divide the corresponding vertices into the\nhot or cold partitions; (2) According to the change of graph structure caused\nby partial vertex convergence after iteration, this paper reclassifies the\npartitions, divides the lower active vertices into cold partition and reduces\nthe frequency of calculation, which thereby reducing the cache miss rate and\nthe I/O overhead caused by active vertices as well; (3) The partition with\nhighest vertex status degree are given a priority calculation in this paper.

However, the very nature of CF is adversarial to the idea of user\nprivacy, because users need to share their preferences with others in order to\nbe grouped with like-minded people and receive accurate recommendations. While\nprevious privacy preserving approaches have been successful inasmuch as they\nconcealed user preference information to some extent from a centralized\nrecommender system, they have also, nevertheless, incurred significant\ntrade-offs in terms of privacy, scalability, and accuracy. They are also\nvulnerable to privacy breaches by malicious actors. In light of these\nobservations, we propose a novel selective privacy preserving (SP2) paradigm\nthat allows users to custom define the scope and extent of their individual\nprivacies, by marking their personal ratings as either public (which can be\nshared) or private (which are never shared and stored only on the user device).\nOur SP2 framework works in two steps: (i) First, it builds an initial\nrecommendation model based on the sum of all public ratings that have been\nshared by users and (ii) then, this public model is fine-tuned on each user's\ndevice based on the user private ratings, thus eventually learning a more\naccurate model. Furthermore, in this work, we introduce three different\nalgorithms for implementing an end-to-end SP2 framework that can scale\neffectively from thousands to hundreds of millions of items. Our user survey\nshows that an overwhelming fraction of users are likely to rate much more items\nto improve the overall recommendations when they can control what ratings will\nbe publicly shared with others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 01:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

This paper, for the first time,\nproposes a no-recurrence sequence-to-sequence text recognizer, named NRTR, that\ndispenses with recurrences and convolutions entirely.

Once the gravity is minimally included\ninto the third order vector field equations, the theory is shown to admit a\ntwo-parameter series of symmetric tensors with on-shell vanishing covariant\ndivergence. The canonical energy-momentum is included into the series. For a\ncertain range of the model parameters, the series include the tensors that meet\nthe weak energy condition, while the canonical energy is unbounded in all the\ninstances. Because of the on-shell vanishing covariant divergence, any of these\ntensors can be considered as an appropriate candidate for the right hand side\nof Einstein's equations. If the source differs from the canonical energy\nmomentum, the coupling is non-Lagrangian while the interaction remains\nconsistent with any of the tensors. We reformulate these not necessarily\nLagrangian third order equations in the first order formalism which is\ncovariant in the sense of 1+2 decomposition. After that, we find the Poisson\nbracket such that the first order equations are Hamiltonian in all the\ninstances, be the original third order equations Lagrangian or not. The\nbrackets differ from canonical ones in the matter sector, while the gravity\nadmits the usual PB's in terms of ADM variables. The Hamiltonian constraints\ngenerate lapse, shift and gauge transformations of the vector field with\nrespect to these Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian constraint, being the lapse\ngenerator, is interpreted as strongly conserved energy. The matter contribution\nto the Hamiltonian constraint corresponds to 00-component of the tensor\nincluded as a source in the right hand side of Einstein equations. Once the\n00-component of the tensor is bounded, the theory meets the usual sufficient\ncondition of classical stability, while the original field equations are of\nthird order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 03:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

In an attempt to shed some light on why this is the case, we\nrevisit some minimax properties of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for the\nsquare loss of linear models---originally developed in the 1990's---and extend\nthem to general stochastic mirror descent (SMD) algorithms for general loss\nfunctions and nonlinear models.

Recent experimental evidence has shown that polymer chains compress in\nCouette flow in a manner counter to expectation. Here, scaling arguments\ndeveloped previously are used to determine the relationship between the\nviscosity and chain radius of gyration. Scaling arguments determine the\nviscosity-radius of gyration relationship to be such that the viscosity is\nproportional to the radius to the power of 9. The viscosity is shown to be a\npower law function of the radius, and to decrease with decreasing radius under\nconditions where the chains are ideal random walks in concentrated solution.\nFurthermore, this relationship is consistent with both the widely observed\nviscosity-temperature and viscosity-shear rate behavior observed in polymer\nrheology. The assumption of extension is not consistent with these observations\nas it would require that the chains increase in size with increasing\ntemperature. Shear thinning is thus a result of a decreasing radius with\nincreasing shear rate as the radius is proportional to the the shear rate\nraised to the power law exponent divided by 9. The thermal expansion\ncoefficient determines the variation in the power law exponents that are\nmeasured for different polymer systems. Typical values on n enable the measured\nreduction in coils size behavior to be fitted. Furthermore, the absurd notion\nthat polymer chains extend to reduce the viscosity implies that an increasing\nchain size results in a reduced viscosity is addressed.

In thispaper, we extend the definition of the group, or\nrather of the associatedorbit, to this general case, and generalize the above\nuniform solution ofsmall step models.

The OI emission distribution is compared to the CO 16-15, CII\n158 micron, and CO 11-10 lines, mm-molecular lines, and continuum. It is\ncomposed of several velocity components in the range from -30 km/s to 25 km/s.\nThe high-velocity blue- and redshifted emission can be explained as arising\nfrom accelerated photodissociated (PDR) gas associated with a dark lane close\nto the massive binary system S106 IR, and from shocks caused by the stellar\nwind and/or a disk--envelope interaction. At velocities from -9 to -4 km/s and\n0.5 to 8 km/s line wings are observed that we attribute to cooling in PDRs\ncreated by the ionizing radiation impinging on the cavity walls. The bulk\nvelocity range is dominated by PDR emission from the clumpy molecular cloud.\nModelling the emission in the different velocity ranges with the KOSMA-tau code\nconstrains a radiation field chi of a few times 10^4 and densities n of a few\ntimes 10^4 cm^-3. Considering self-absorption of the OI line results in higher\ndensities (up to 10^6 cm^-3) only for the gas component seen at high blue- and\nred velocities. The dark lane has a mass of 275 Msun and shows a velocity\ndifference of 1.4 km/s along its projected length of 1 pc, determined from\nH13CO+ 1-0 mapping. It can be interpreted as a massive accretion flow, or the\nremains of it, linked to S106 IR/FIR. The most likely explanation is that the\nbinary system is at a stage of its evolution where gas accretion is\ncounteracted by the stellar winds and radiation, leading to the very complex\nobserved spatial and kinematic emission distribution of the various tracers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 07:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Cancellation of SI is generally implemented as a multi-stage approach.\nThis work proposes a novel adaptive SI cancellation algorithm in the digital\ndomain and a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art adaptive cancellation\ntechniques. Inspired by recent progress in acoustic echo control, we introduce\na composite state-space model of the nonlinear SI channel in cascade structure.\nWe derive a SI cancellation algorithm that decouples the identification of\nlinear and nonlinear elements of the composite state.

We show that this adaptation can be supported by a-priori signal\northogonalization and decoding of the signal-of-interest (SoI). In our\nsimulation results, we analyze the performance by evaluating residual\ninterference, system identification accuracy and communication rate. Based on\nthe results, we provide recommendations for system design. In case of input\northogonalization, our Kalman filter solution in cascade structure delivers\nbest performance with low computational complexity. In this configuration, the\nperformance lines up with that of the monolithic (parallel) Kalman filter or\nthe recursive-least squares (RLS) algorithms.

While attenuation models exist for the\nCENA, concerns over the increased rate of seismicity in this region necessitate\ninvestigation of ground motions prediction models particular to these states.\nTo do so, an ANN-based framework is proposed to predict peak ground\nacceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV) given magnitude, earthquake\nsource-to-site distance, and shear wave velocity. In this framework,\napproximately 4,500 ground motions with magnitude greater than 3.0 recorded in\nthese three states (Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas) since 2005 are considered.\nResults from this study suggest that existing ground motion prediction models\ndeveloped for CENA do not accurately predict the ground motion intensity\nmeasures for earthquakes in this region, especially for those with low\nsource-to-site distances or on very soft soil conditions. The proposed ANN\nmodels provide much more accurate prediction of the ground motion intensity\nmeasures at all distances and magnitudes. The proposed ANN models are also\nconverted to relatively simple mathematical equations so that engineers can\neasily use them to predict the ground motion intensity measures for future\nevents.

Recently our ability to study stars using asteroseismic techniques\nhas increased dramatically, largely through the use of space based photometric\nobservations. Work has also been done using ground based spectroscopic\nobservations and more is expected in the near future from the SONG network.\nUnfortunately, the intensity observations have an inferior signal to noise\nratio and details of the observations do not agree with theory, while the data\nanalysis used in the spectroscopic method has often been based on overly simple\nmodels of the spectra. Aims. The aim is to improve the reliability of\nmeasurements of the parameters of stellar oscillations using spectroscopic\nobservations and to enable the optimal use of the observations. Methods. While\nprevious investigations have used 1D models, I use realistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations, combined with radiative transfer calculations,\nto estimate the effects of the oscillations on the spectra. I then calculate\nthe visibility of the oscillation modes for a variety of stellar parameters and\nusing various fitting methods. In addition to the methods used in previous\ninvestigations, I use a Singular Value Decomposition technique, which allows\none to determine the information content available from the spectral\nperturbations and how that can be expressed most compactly. Finally I describe\nhow the time series obtained may be analyzed. Results. It is shown that it is\nimportant to model the visibilities carefully and that the results deviate\nsubstantially from models previously used, especially in the presence of\nrotation. Detailed spectral modeling may be exploited to measure the properties\nof a larger number of modes than possible using the commonly used\ncross-correlation method.

Various methods have been\nproposed to partially address this, including truncation and stabilized-IPTW to\ntemper extreme weights and covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) to\naddress treatment model misspecification.

We show that our proposed general noise model\nallows to perform ICA in settings where other noisy ICA procedures fail.\nAdditionally, it can be used for applications with grouped data by adjusting\nfor different stationary noise within each group. Our proposed noise model has\na natural relation to causality and we explain how it can be applied in the\ncontext of causal inference.

With respect to the Bremsstrahlung X-ray emission of the hot\nplasma in that region the Galactic Center casts a 'shadow'. The 'shadow' is\ncaused by the Circum Nuclear Disk that surrounds SgrA* at a distance of about 1\nto 2 parsec. This detection allows us to do a detailed investigation of the\nphysical properties of the surroundings of the super massive black hole.\nFurther in, the cluster of high velocity stars orbiting the central super\nmassive black hole SgrA* represents an ideal probe for the gravitational\npotential and the degree of relativity that one can attribute to this area.\nRecently, three of the closest stars (S2, S38, and S55/S0-102) have been used\nto conduct these investigations. In addition to the black hole mass and\ndistance a relativistic parameter defined as ${\\Upsilon}=r_s/r_p$ could be\nderived for star S2. The quantity $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius and $r_p$\nis the pericenter distance of the orbiting star. Here, in this publication, we\nhighlight the robustness and significance of this result. If one aims at\ninvestigating stronger relativistic effects one needs to get closer to SgrA*.\nHere, one can use the emission of plasma blobs that orbit SgrA*. This\ninformation can be obtained by modeling lightcurves of bright X-ray flares.\nFinally, we comment on the shadow of the SgrA* black hole expected due to light\nbending and boosting in its vicinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 13:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

Many theoretical analyses so far have found\na complete (or sufficiently quickly expanding) topology as underlying migration\ngraph most efficient for optimization, even though a quick dissemination of\nindividuals leads to a loss of diversity. We suggest a simple fitness function\nFORK with two local optima parametrized by $r \\geq 2$ and a scheme for\ncomposite fitness functions.

Finally, the ring topology, making use of rare\nmigrations and a large diameter, can achieve a run time of\n$\\tilde{\\Theta}(n^r)$, the black box complexity of FORK. This shows that the\nring topology can be preferable over the complete topology in order to maintain\ndiversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 14:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

The benefits afforded by virtualization - enhanced isolation,\nmanageability, flexibility, and security - could be instrumental for developers\nof embedded systems as an answer to the rampant increase in complexity.\n  While mature desktop and server solutions exist, they cannot be easily reused\non embedded systems because of markedly different requirements. Unfortunately,\noptimizations aimed at throughput, important for servers, often compromise on\naspects like predictable real-time behavior, which are crucial to many embedded\nsystems. In a similar vein, the requirements for small trusted computing bases,\nlightweight inter-VM communication, and small footprints are often not\naccommodated.

Our analysis of the 2015\nspectra, as well as prior spectra from 2012, shows that there is a factor of\nthree decrease in the effective upper tropospheric methane mixing ratio between\n30\\deg N and 70\\deg N. The absolute value of the deep methane mixing ratio,\nwhich probably does not vary with latitude, is lower than our previous\nestimate, and depends significantly on the style of aerosol model that we\nassume, ranging from a high of 3.5$\\pm$0.5% for conservative non-spherical\nparticles with a simple Henyey-Greenstein phase function to a low of\n2.7%$\\pm$0.3% for conservative spherical particles.

The group of oscillators yield a completely symmetric OD state\nwhen uncoupled to the external system, i.e. the two OD states occur with equal\nprobability. However, remarkably, when coupled to a common external system this\nsymmetry is significantly broken. For exponentially decaying external systems,\nthe symmetry breaking is very pronounced for low environmental damping and\nstrong oscillator-environment coupling. This is evident through the sharp\ntransition from the symmetric to asymmetric state occurring at a critical\noscillator-environment coupling strength and environmental damping rate.\nFurther, we consider time-varying connections to the common external\nenvironment, with a fraction of oscillator-environment links switching on and\noff. Interestingly, we find that the asymmetry induced by environmental\ncoupling decreases as a power law with increase in fraction of such on-off\nconnections. The suggests that blinking oscillator-environment links can\nrestore the symmetry of the OD state. Lastly, we demonstrate the generality of\nour results for a constant external drive, and find marked breaking of symmetry\nin the OD states there as well. When the constant environmental drive is large,\nthe asymmetry in the OD states is very large, and the transition between the\nsymmetric and asymmetric state with increasing oscillator-environment coupling\nis very sharp.

These states are\ncompact exotic hadrons which can be approximated as the diquark-anti-diquark\ncorrelations. In the flavor SU(3) symmetry, they form an SU(3) triplet or\nanti-sextet. The spectra of the stable doubly heavy tetraquark states are\npredicted by Sakharov-Zeldovich formula. We find that the\n$T^+_{cc\\bar{u}\\bar{d}}({\\bf 3})$ is about 16MeV below the $DD^*$ threshold,\nwhile $T^{-}_{bb\\bar{u}\\bar{d}}({\\bf 3})$ is about 73MeV below the $BB^*$\nthreshold. We then study the semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of the\nstable doubly heavy tetraquark states. The decay amplitudes are parametrized in\nterms of SU(3)-irreducible amplitudes. Ratios between decay widths of different\nchannels are also derived. At the end, we collect the Cabibbo allowed two-body\nand three-body decay channels, which are most promising to search for the\nstable doubly heavy tetraquark states at LHCb and Belle II experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 11:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 14:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 14:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 08:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

The paper proposes a radically\ndifferent approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the\nbehavior of the wireless environments. The key-enabler is the so-called\nHyperSurface tile, a novel class of planar meta-materials which can interact\nwith impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The HyperSurface\ntiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering\ntowards any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation and\nmore. Multiple tiles are employed to coat objects such as walls, furniture,\noverall, any objects in the indoor and outdoor environments. An external\nsoftware service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile,\nto best fit the needs of communicating devices.

There are two different types of color\ninduction: color contrast (the color of the central region shifts away from\nthat of the inducer) and color assimilation (the color shifts towards the color\nof the inducer). Several studies on these effects used uniform and striped\nsurrounds, reporting color contrast and color assimilation, respectively. Other\nauthors (Kaneko and Murakami, J Vision, 2012) studied color induction using\nflashed uniform surrounds, reporting that the contrast was higher for shorter\nflash duration. Extending their work, we present new psychophysical results\nusing both flashed and static (i.e., non-flashed) equiluminant stimuli for both\nstriped and uniform surround. Similarly to them, for uniform surround stimuli\nwe observed color contrast, but we did not obtain the maximum contrast for the\nshortest (10 ms) flashed stimuli, but for 40 ms. We only observed this maximum\ncontrast for red, green and lime inducers, while for a purple inducer we\nobtained an asymptotic profile along flash duration. For striped stimuli, we\nobserved color assimilation only for the static (infinite flash duration)\nred-green surround inducers (red 1st inducer, green 2nd inducer). For the other\ninducers' configurations, we observed color contrast or no induction. Since\nother works showed that non-equiluminant striped static stimuli induce color\nassimilation, our results also suggest that luminance differences could be a\nkey factor to induce it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 08:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

We provide an analytical description\nof its functionality and demonstrate its capabilities on systematically\ncontrolled leptokurtic noise. Hereby, we investigate the properties of\nleptokurtic time series and their influence on the Fourier phases of time\nseries.

Testing for nonlinearities by means of surrogates\nshows that the new method yields strong significances for nonlinear behavior.\nDue to the drastically decreased computing time as compared to embedding space\nmethods the number of surrogate realizations can be increased by orders of\nmagnitude. Thereby, the probability distribution of the test statistics can\nvery accurately be derived and parametrized which allows for much more precise\ntests on nonlinearities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 15:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}
