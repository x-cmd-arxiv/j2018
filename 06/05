One approach\nis to outsource encrypted data to the cloud server and have the cloud server\nperform query processing on the encrypted data only. It remains a challenging\ntask to support various queries over encrypted data in a secure and efficient\nway such that the cloud server does not gain any knowledge about the data,\nquery, and query result. In this paper, we study the problem of secure skyline\nqueries over encrypted data.

We propose a fully secure skyline query protocol on\ndata encrypted using semantically-secure encryption.

One of its nicest geometric/duality properties\nis the fact that the vertices of its feasible region correspond exactly to the\ncuts of a graph, as proved by Laurent and Poljak in 1995. Recall that a\nboundary point $x$ of a convex set $C$ is called a vertex of $C$ if the normal\ncone of $C$ at $x$ is full-dimensional.\n  We study how often strict complementarity holds or fails for the MaxCut SDP\nwhen a vertex of the feasible region is optimal, i.e., when the SDP relaxation\nis tight. While strict complementarity is known to hold when the objective\nfunction is in the interior of the normal cone at any vertex, we prove that it\nfails generically at the boundary of such normal cone. In this regard, the\nMaxCut SDP displays the nastiest behavior possible for a convex optimization\nproblem.\n  We also study strict complementarity with respect to two classes of objective\nfunctions. We show that, when the objective functions are sampled uniformly\nfrom the negative semidefinite rank-one matrices in the boundary of the normal\ncone at any vertex, the probability that strict complementarity holds lies in\n$(0,1)$. We also extend a construction due to Laurent and Poljak of weighted\nLaplacian matrices for which strict complementarity fails.

In addition, inter-object relations are mostly\nmodeled in a symmetric way, which we argue is not an optimal setting. To tackle\nthose difficulties, in this paper, we propose a Deep Continuous Conditional\nRandom Field (DCCRF) for solving the online MOT problem in a track-by-detection\nframework. The DCCRF consists of unary and pairwise terms. The unary terms\nestimate tracked objects' displacements across time based on visual appearance\ninformation. They are modeled as deep Convolution Neural Networks, which are\nable to learn discriminative visual features for tracklet association. The\nasymmetric pairwise terms model inter-object relations in an asymmetric way,\nwhich encourages high-confidence tracklets to help correct errors of\nlow-confidence tracklets and not to be affected by low-confidence ones much.\nThe DCCRF is trained in an end-to-end manner for better adapting the influences\nof visual information as well as inter-object relations. Extensive experimental\ncomparisons with state-of-the-arts as well as detailed component analysis of\nour proposed DCCRF on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed MOT framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 16:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

Frictional heating thus plays a\ncrucial role in the energy budget of earthquakes, but, to date, it cannot be\nresolved by seismological data. Here we investigate the dynamics of laboratory\nearthquakes by measuring frictional heat dissipated during the propagation of\nshear instabilities at typical seismogenic depth stress conditions. We perform,\nfor the first time, the full energy budget of earthquake rupture and\ndemonstrate that increasing the radiation efficiency, i.e. the ratio of energy\nradiated away via elastic waves compared to that dissipated locally, increases\nwith increasing thermal - frictional - weakening. Using an in-situ carbon\nthermometer, we map frictional heating temperature heterogeneities - 'heat'\nasperities - on the fault surface. Combining our microstructural, temperature\nand mechanical observations, we show that an increase in fault strength\ncorresponds to a transition from a weak fault with multiple strong asperities,\nbut little overall radiation, to a highly radiative fault, which behaves as a\nsingle strong asperity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 16:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

In this work we present\na comparative study of the OER on the oxide NaTaO$_3$ (113) surface and the\noxynitride SrTaO$_2$N (001) surface. Oxynitrides are highly promising\nphotocatalysts due to their smaller band gap and resulting better visible light\nabsorption compared to oxides but our knowledge about their surface structure\nand chemistry is still very limited. With the goal to compare the surface\nchemistry of oxides and oxynitrides, we perform density functional theory\ncalculations to obtain the free energy changes associated with the OER reaction\nsteps. For the OER at the Ta site of the clean surfaces, our results predict\nthe rate-limiting step for both materials to be the formation of the *OOH\nintermediate, with a larger overpotential for the oxide than the oxynitride\n(1.30 V vs 1.01 V). The Na site is found to be more active than the Ta site on\nthe oxide surface with an OER overpotential of 0.88 V, whereas the OER at the\nSr site on the oxynitride has an overpotential of 1.14 V. For the A sites,\ncontrary to the Ta site, the deprotonation of *OH was found to be the\nrate-limiting step. Computed Pourbaix diagrams show that at relevant\n(photo)electrochemical conditions all surfaces are covered with oxygen\nadsorbates. Oxygen adsorbates at A (Na, Sr) sites are however found to couple\nand desorb as O$_2$, leaving these sites empty under typical operating\nconditions. Following this desorption, we find the OER to proceed by the\nconventional *OOH mechanism on the SrO termination of the oxynitride but by a\ndirect coupling of neighbouring *O at Na sites on the oxide surface. This\ncoupling mechanism on the oxide has the smallest overpotential of 0.79 V\ncompared to 0.88 V for the oxynitride, implying that the oxide is a better OER\ncatalyst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 17:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Each term in\nthe transport equation has been spectrally decomposed to expose the\ncontribution of turbulence at different length scales to the processes\ngoverning the flow of energy in the wall-normal direction, in scale and among\ncomponents.\n  The outer-layer turbulence is dominated by very large-scale streamwise\nelongated modes. Away from the wall, production occurs primarily in these\nlarge-scale streamwise-elongated modes in the streamwise velocity, but\ndissipation occurs nearly isotropically in both velocity components and scale.\nFor this to happen, the energy is transferred from the streamwise elongated\nmodes to modes with a range of orientations through non-linear interactions,\nand then transferred to other velocity components. This allows energy to be\ntransferred more-or-less isotropically from these large scales to the small\nscales at which dissipation occurs. The VLSMs also transfer energy to the\nwall-region resulting in a modulation of the autonomous near-wall dynamics.\n  The near-wall energy flows are consistent with the well-known autonomous\nnear-wall dynamics. Through the overlap region between outer and inner layer\nturbulence, there is a self-similar structure to the energy flows. The VLSM\nproduction occurs at spanwise scales that grow with $y$. There is transport of\nenergy away from the wall over a range of scales that grows with $y$. And,\nthere is transfer of energy to small dissipative scales which grow like\n$y^{1/4}$.

In this paper, we propose taking a learning-based approach to designing\ncodes that can handle non-linear computations. We present carefully designed\nneural network architectures and a training methodology for learning encoding\nand decoding functions that produce approximate reconstructions of unavailable\ncomputation results. We present extensive experimental results demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach: we show that the our learned codes\ncan accurately reconstruct $64 - 98\\%$ of the unavailable predictions from\nneural-network based image classifiers on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and\nCIFAR-10 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first\nlearning-based approach for designing codes, and also presents the first\ncoding-theoretic solution that can provide resilience for any non-linear\n(differentiable) computation. Our results show that learning can be an\neffective technique for designing codes, and that learned codes are a highly\npromising approach for bringing the benefits of coding to non-linear\ncomputations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 17:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

However, many\ndefining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much\ndifferent pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular,\ngeneralizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from\ninfancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI.\n  The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We\nargue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to\nachieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and\ncomputations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature\nand nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between\n\"hand-engineering\" and \"end-to-end\" learning, and instead advocate for an\napproach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how\nusing relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can\nfacilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We\npresent a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational\ninductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various\napproaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a\nstraightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing\nstructured behaviors.

These interaction and disorder effects can be incorporated into a\nmean-field description by means of a self-energy appearing in the Green's\nfunction. We first examine the quasiparticle scattering interference spectra in\nthe superconducting state at optimal doping as temperature is increased.\nAssuming agreement with angle-resolved photoemission experiments which suggest\nthat the scattering rate depends on temperature, resulting in the filling of\nthe $d$-wave gap, we find that the peaks predicted by the octet model become\nprogressively smeared as temperature is increased. When the scattering rate is\nof the same order of magnitude as the superconducting gap, the spectral\nfunction shows Fermi-arc-like patterns, while the power spectrum of the local\ndensity of states shows the destruction of the octet-model peaks. We next\nconsider the normal state properties of the optimally-doped cuprates. We model\nthis by adding a marginal Fermi liquid self-energy to the normal-state\npropagator, and consider the dependence of the QPI spectra on frequency,\ntemperature, and doping. We demonstrate that the MFL self-energy leads to a\nsmearing of the caustics appearing in the normal-state QPI power spectrum as\neither temperature or frequency is increased at fixed doping.

The shape of the stellar initial mass function in various galaxy\npopulations underpins our understanding of the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies across cosmic time. Classical determinations of the stellar initial\nmass function in local galaxies are traditionally made at ultraviolet, optical\nand near-infrared wavelengths, which cannot be probed in dust-obscured\ngalaxies, especially in distant starbursts, whose apparent star-formation rates\nare hundreds to thousands of times higher than in our Milky Way, selected at\nsubmillimetre (rest-frame far-infrared) wavelengths.

RomulusC,\na zoom-in simulation of a halo with $z=0$ mass $10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, is run\nwith the same sub-grid physics and resolution as Romulus25 (Tremmel et al.\n2017). With unprecedented mass and spatial resolution, RomulusC represents a\nunique opportunity to study the evolution of galaxies in dense environments\ndown to dwarf masses. We demonstrate that RomulusC results in an intracluster\nmedium (ICM) consistent with observations. The star formation history and\nstellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is consistent with\nobservations and abundance matching results, indicating that our sub-grid\nmodels, optimized only to reproduce observations of field dwarf and Milky Way\nmass galaxies, are able to produce reasonable galaxy masses and star formation\nhistories in much higher mass systems. Feedback from supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs) regulates star formation by driving large-scale, collimated outflows\nthat coexist with a low entropy core. We find that non-BCG cluster member\ngalaxies are substantially quenched compared to the field down to dwarf galaxy\nmasses and, at low masses, quenching is seen to have no dependence on mass or\ndistance from the cluster center. This enhanced quenched population extends\nbeyond $R_{200}$ and is in place at high redshift. Similarly, we predict that\nSMBH activity is significantly suppressed within clusters outside of the BCG,\nbut show how the effect could be lost when only focusing on the brightest AGN\nin the most massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 19:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

We find no correlation between the column density of NV and the\nneutral gas properties such as metallicity, HI column density and dust\ndepletion, however the relative velocity of NV, typically a blueshift with\nrespect to the neutral gas, is found to be correlated with the column density\nof HI. This may be explained if the NV gas is part of an HII region hosting the\nGRB, where the region's expansion is confined by dense, neutral gas in the\nGRB's host galaxy. We find tentative evidence (at 2-sigma significance) that\nthe X-ray derived column density, N_H,X, may be correlated with the column\ndensity of NV, which would indicate that both measurements are sensitive to the\ncolumn density of the gas located in the vicinity of the GRB.

Specifically, we use PD\ntechniques to decompose a target molecular system into smaller subsystems\nrequiring fewer computational resources. In our framework, there are two levels\nof hybridization. At the first level, we use a classical algorithm to decompose\na target molecule into subsystems, and utilize a quantum algorithm to simulate\nthe quantum nature of the subsystems. The second level is in the quantum\nalgorithm. We consider the quantum--classical variational algorithm that\niterates between an expectation estimation using a quantum device and a\nparameter optimization using a classical device. We investigate three popular\nPD techniques for our hybrid approach: the fragment molecular-orbital (FMO)\nmethod, the divide-and-conquer (DC) technique, and the density matrix embedding\ntheory (DMET). We examine the efficacy of these techniques in correctly\ndifferentiating conformations of simple alkane molecules.

One\nsuch application in which we are interested is the alignment of orientation\nvectors among members of a swarm. Despite being commonly used for this purpose,\nthe Kuramoto model can only describe swarms in 2 dimensions, and hence the\nresults obtained do not apply to the often relevant situation of swarms in 3\ndimensions. Partly based on this motivation, as well as on relevance to the\nclassical, mean-field, zero-temperature Heisenberg model with quenched site\ndisorder, in this paper we study the Kuramoto model generalized to $D$\ndimensions. We show that in the important case of 3 dimensions, as well as for\nany odd number of dimensions, the $D$-dimensional generalized Kuramoto model\nfor heterogeneous units has dynamics that are remarkably different from the\ndynamics in 2 dimensions. In particular, for odd $D$ the transition to\ncoherence occurs discontinuously as the inter-unit coupling constant $K$ is\nincreased through zero, as opposed to the $D=2$ case (and, as we show, also the\ncase of even $D$) for which the transition to coherence occurs continuously as\n$K$ increases through a positive critical value $K_c$.

Consequently, the expected\nruntime is the inverse of this number, and thus only depends on the probability\nto flip between $1$ and $k$ bits, but not on other characteristics of the\nmutation operator.

In fact, only image\nsegmentation can produce regions based on edges, but it requires thresholding\nby simply separating the regions into binary in-out information. Hence, there\nis currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms, since edges\ncannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The\nobjective of this paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that\nallows determining the probability of inclusion inside a set of partial\ncontours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed a new approach that\nuses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the\nrequired probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous\nspace of probability based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap\nbetween the edge-based methods and the region-based methods.

We\nmeasure broadband molecular absorption spectra of acetylene by interleaving 800\nspectra taken at 250-MHz per spectral step using a 60-GHz-coarse-resolution\nspectrometer and exploits advances of integrated heater which can locally and\nrapidly change the refractive index of a microresonator with low electrical\nconsumption (0.9 GHz/mW), which is orders of magnitude lower than a fiber-based\ncomb. This approach offers a path towards a simple, robust and low-power\nconsumption CMOS-compatible platform capable of remote sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 19:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Although spin quantization is routinely encountered in\nfermionic topological edge states, analogous quantization for bosons has proven\nelusive. To this end, we develop the complete electromagnetic continuum theory\ncharacterizing 2+1D topological bosons, taking into account their intrinsic\nspin and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that\nspatiotemporal dispersion (momentum and frequency dependence of linear\nresponse) captures the matter-mediated interactions between bosons and is a\nnecessary ingredient for topological phases. We prove that the bulk topology of\nthese 2+1D phases is manifested in transverse spin-1 quantization of the\nphoton. From this insight, we predict two unique bosonic phases - one with even\nparity $C=\\pm 2$ and one with odd $C=\\pm 1$.

In this paper we point out that the\ndeformed Hamiltonian $H=2 \\cosh(p)+ V_N(x)$ is exactly solvable for any\npotential: a conjectural exact quantization condition, involving well-defined\nfunctions, can be written down in closed form, and determines the spectrum of\nbound states and resonances. In particular, no resummation techniques are\nneeded.

Here, we\npresent the study of the physical effect of introduction of finite thickness on\nthe generation of small-scale spiral arms by swing amplification in a\ndifferentially rotating galactic disk. The galactic disk is modelled first as a\none-fluid system, and then as a gravitationally-coupled two-fluid (stars and\ngas) system where each fluid is taken as isothermal, and corotating with each\nother. We derived the equations governing the evolution of growth of the\nnon-axisymmetric perturbations in a sheared frame of reference while\nincorporating the effect of finite thickness of a galactic disk. We found that\nthe finite thickness of a galactic disk has a generic trend of suppressing the\ngrowth of the non-axisymmetric perturbations via swing amplification. Moreover,\neven the observed range of disk-thickness values (~ 300-500 pc) can lead to a\ncomplete suppression of swing amplification for Q ~ 1.7, whereas for an\ninfinitesimally-thin disk, the corresponding critical value is Q ~ 2. For a\ntwo-fluid (stars and gas) system, the net amplification is shown to be set by\nthe mutual interplay of the effect of interstellar gas in promoting the spiral\nfeatures and the effect of finite thickness in preventing the spiral arms. The\ncoexistence of these two opposite effects is shown to be capable of giving rise\nto diverse and complex dynamical behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 00:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

However,\nan open challenge in this area is developing techniques that can go beyond\nsimple edge prediction and handle more complex logical queries, which might\ninvolve multiple unobserved edges, entities, and variables. For instance, given\nan incomplete biological knowledge graph, we might want to predict \"em what\ndrugs are likely to target proteins involved with both diseases X and Y?\" -- a\nquery that requires reasoning about all possible proteins that {\\em might}\ninteract with diseases X and Y. Here we introduce a framework to efficiently\nmake predictions about conjunctive logical queries -- a flexible but tractable\nsubset of first-order logic -- on incomplete knowledge graphs. In our approach,\nwe embed graph nodes in a low-dimensional space and represent logical operators\nas learned geometric operations (e.g., translation, rotation) in this embedding\nspace. By performing logical operations within a low-dimensional embedding\nspace, our approach achieves a time complexity that is linear in the number of\nquery variables, compared to the exponential complexity required by a naive\nenumeration-based approach.

In hole-doped monolayer MoS$_2$, both spin-orbit coupling\nand the multi-orbital effects are more prominent than those of electron-doped\nsystem. Near the valence band edge, the Fermi surfaces are composed of three\ndifferent types of hole pockets, namely, one mainly consisting of the almost\nspin-degenerate $|d_{z^{2}}\\rangle$ orbital near $\\Gamma$ point, and the others\nof the spin-split upper and lower bands near ${\\rm K}$ and ${\\rm K}'$ points\narising from the $|d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\rangle$ and $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ orbitals. The\nnumber of relevant Fermi pockets increases with increase of the doping. At very\nlow doping, the upper split bands of $|d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\rangle$ and\n$|d_{xy}\\rangle$ are concerned, yielding extremely low $T_{\\rm c}$ due to small\ndensity of states of the split bands.

The explanation is simple. Sparse and stochastic\ngraphs create a lot of small trees that are connected to the core of the graph\nby only one edge. Graph conductance is sensitive to these noisy `dangling\nsets'. Spectral clustering inherits this sensitivity. The second part of the\npaper starts from a previously proposed form of regularized spectral clustering\nand shows that it is related to the graph conductance on a `regularized graph'.\nWe call the conductance on the regularized graph CoreCut. Based upon previous\narguments that relate graph conductance to spectral clustering (e.g. Cheeger\ninequality), minimizing CoreCut relaxes to regularized spectral clustering.\nSimple inspection of CoreCut reveals why it is less sensitive to small cuts in\nthe graph. Together, these results show that unbalanced partitions from\nspectral clustering can be understood as overfitting to noise in the periphery\nof a sparse and stochastic graph.

In many cases, however, Fourier\ndomain may not be the natural choice. For example, in holography, low-pass\nprojections of sparse signals are obtained in the Fresnel domain. Similarly,\ntime-varying system identification relies on low-pass projections on the space\nof linear frequency modulated signals. In this paper, we study the recovery of\nsparse signals from low-pass projections in the Special Affine Fourier\nTransform domain (SAFT). The SAFT parametrically generalizes a number of well\nknown unitary transformations that are used in signal processing and optics. In\nanalogy to the Shannon's sampling framework, we specify sampling theorems for\nrecovery of sparse signals considering three specific cases: (1) sampling with\narbitrary, bandlimited kernels, (2) sampling with smooth, time-limited kernels\nand, (3) recovery from Gabor transform measurements linked with the SAFT\ndomain.

In deriving our results, we introduce the SAFT series (analogous\nto the Fourier series) and the short time SAFT, and study convolution theorems\nthat establish a convolution--multiplication property in the SAFT domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 03:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

As a result, there have\nrecently been research efforts that aimed to develop techniques that leverage\ncompressive sampling to enable compressed wideband spectrum sensing. These\ntechniques consider homogeneous wideband spectrum where all bands are assumed\nto have similar PU traffic characteristics. In practice, however, wideband\nspectrum is not homogeneous, in that different spectrum bands could have\ndifferent PU occupancy patterns. In fact, the nature of spectrum assignment, in\nwhich applications of similar types are often assigned bands within the same\nblock, dictates that wideband spectrum is indeed heterogeneous, as different\napplication types exhibit different behaviors. In this paper, we consider\nheterogeneous wideband spectrum, where we exploit this inherent, block-like\nstructure of wideband spectrum to design efficient compressive spectrum sensing\ntechniques that are well suited for heterogeneous wideband spectrum. We propose\na weighted $\\ell_1$-minimization sensing information recovery algorithm that\nachieves more stable recovery than that achieved by existing approaches while\naccounting for the variations of spectrum occupancy across both the time and\nfrequency dimensions.

We develop a modeling framework\nfor tumor ablation, and present the simplest possible model for drug diffusion\nin a spherical tumor with leaky boundaries and assuming cell death eventually\nleads to ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities\nnumerically equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends\non both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to the\ncell. Higher oxygen availability leads to cell death at lower drug\nconcentrations. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required for\na cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The\nconcentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which allows us\nto compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can be plotted at\nmuch finer time intervals compared to that of experiments, which is used to\nproduce a dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture\nof the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the diffusion,\nleak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is different for different\nindividuals and tumors, we produce artificial replication data through\nbootstrapping to simulate error.

Finally, we evaluate our method on public Kodak and the Test\nDataset P/M released by the Computer Vision Lab of ETH Zurich, resulting in\naveraged 7.81% and 19.1% BD-rate reduction over BPG, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 05:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Thus,\nhow to improve efficiently the performance of bearing fault diagnosis under\ndifferent working conditions is always a primary challenge. In this paper, a\nnovel bearing fault diagnosis under different working conditions method is\nproposed based on domain adaptation using transferable features(DATF). The\ndataset of normal bearing and faulty bearings are obtained through the fast\nFourier transformation(FFT) of raw vibration signals under different motor\nspeeds and load conditions.

The estimates of\nthese models and the resulting projections are conditional on the UN's official\nestimates of past values.

Virtual excitation of the collective\nelectronic modes of such superconductors in a magnetic field appears as an\nefficient way to realize the nonlinear interaction of light at the level of two\nsingle photons. The essence of the effect is in the fact that the pondermotor\nenergy is proportional to the ratio of the charge squared to the mass of the\n\"collective particle\" interacting with radiation, $e^2/m$, and therefore, for a\n\"particle\" representing a collective motion of many electrons, it scales\nlinearly-, and its second-order correction quadratically with the number of the\nelectrons involved.

In our current study, we perform numerical\nsimulations for flow over an oscillating hydrofoil for a wide range of flow and\nkinematic parameters.

We find that the distributions of the sound pressure levels at\nthe oscillating frequency and its first even harmonic due to the pressure\nfluctuations in the fluid domain are dipole-like patterns. The magnitudes of\nthese sound pressure levels depend on the Reynolds number and Strouhal number,\nwhereas the direction of their dipole-axes appears to be affected by the\nreduced frequency only.

The\nhigher frequency of some phenotypes in urban vs rural/wild areas has led to the\nassumption that directional selection in urban habitats occurs, which may\nthereby favour some behavioural and physiological traits in urban animal\npopulations compared to rural ones. However, empirical evidence of directional\nselection on phenotypic traits in urban areas remains scarce. In this study we\ntested whether eumelanin-based colouration could be linked to survival in two\nurban populations of the feral pigeon Columba livia. A number of studies in\ndifferent cities pointed out a higher frequency of darker individuals in more\nurbanised areas compared to rural ones. To investigate whether directional\nselection through survival on this highly heritable trait could explain such\npatterns, we conducted mark-recapture studies on two populations of feral\npigeons in highly urbanized areas. We predicted that darker coloured\nindividuals would exhibit higher survival and/or philopatry (integrated into\n'local survival') than paler coloured ones. No difference in local survival was\nfound between adults of different colouration intensities. However, on one\nsite, we found that darker juveniles had a higher local survival probability\nthan light ones. Juvenile local survival on that site was also negatively\ncorrelated with the number of chicks born. This suggests the existence of\ncolour- and/or density-dependent selection processes acting on juvenile feral\npigeons in urban environments, acting through differential mortality and/or\ndispersal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 08:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

We evaluate our model on diverse\nand heterogeneous tasks from EHR datasets and show practical advantages over\nstandard time-series deep models such as pure Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 08:26:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 09:44:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 03:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

Indeed, the kriging\npredictor is not straightforwarldly available as it requires the inversion of\nthe covariance matrix of the data. The challenge of handling such datasets is\ntherefore to extract the maximum of information they contain while ensuring the\nnumerical tractability of the associated inference and prediction algorithms.\nThe different approaches that have been developed in the literature to address\nthis problem can be classified into two families, both aiming at making the\ninversion of the covariance matrix computationally feasible.

Considering that\nthe initial capacity of the lightweight network is very limited, we present an\nadaptive importance learning scheme for SISR that trains the network with an\neasy-to-complex paradigm by dynam- ically updating the importance of image\npixels on the basis of the training loss. Specifically, we formulate the\nnetwork training and the importance learning into a joint optimization problem.\nWith a carefully designed importance penalty function, the importance of\nindividual pixels can be gradu- ally increased through solving a convex\noptimization problem. The training process thus begins with pixels that are\neasy to reconstruct, and gradually proceeds to more complex pixels as fitting\nimproves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 09:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

This paper suggests a method to cache videos of\ndifferent qualities, and thus of varying file sizes, by maximizing the sum of\nvideo quality measures that users can enjoy. There exists an interesting\ntrade-off between video quality and video diversity, i.e., the ability to\nprovision diverse video files.

In addition, when multiple devices cache the\nsame file but their qualities are different, advanced node association is\nrequired for file delivery. This paper proposes a node association algorithm\nthat maximizes time-averaged video quality for multiple users under a playback\ndelay constraint.

The main contribution of this work is a\nprediction framework able to use characteristic temporal signatures of places\ntogether with k-nearest neighbor metrics capturing similarities among urban\nregions, to forecast weekly popularity dynamics of a new venue establishment in\na city neighborhood.

In\nparticular, nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs) employed at the transmitter\ndistort the signal when operated close to saturation due to energy efficiency\nconsiderations. In this paper, we study the performance of a MIMO mmWave hybrid\nbeamforming scheme in the presence of nonlinear PAs. First, we develop a\nstatistical model for the transmitted signal in such systems and show that the\nspatial direction of the inband distortion is shaped by the beamforming filter.\nThis suggests that even in the large antenna regime, where narrow beams can be\nsteered toward the receiver, the impact of nonlinear PAs should not be ignored.\nThen, by employing a realistic power consumption model for the PAs, we\ninvestigate the trade-off between spectral and energy efficiency in such\nsystems. Our results show that increasing the transmit power level when the\nnumber of transmit antennas grows large can be counter-effective in terms of\nenergy efficiency. Furthermore, using numerical simulation, we show that when\nthe transmit power is large, analog beamforming leads to higher spectral and\nenergy efficiency compared to digital and hybrid beamforming schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 10:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

We propose\nan extension to the Neural Variational Document Model (Miao et al., 2016) that\ndoes exactly that to separate local (syntactic) context from the global\n(semantic) representation of the document. Our model builds on the variational\nautoencoder framework to define a generative document model based on next-word\nprediction. We name our approach Sequence-Aware Variational Autoencoder since\nin contrast to its predecessor, it operates on the true input sequence. In a\nseries of experiments we observe stronger topicality of the learned\nrepresentations as well as increased robustness to syntactic noise in our\ntraining data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 12:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Our approach exploits both colour and depth information\nrecorded by a single RGB-D camera to better deal with negative factors such as\nlighting conditions and lane-like objects. In the approach, colour and depth\nimages are first converted to a half-binary format and a 2D matrix of 3D\npoints. They are then used as the inputs of template matching and geometric\nfeature extraction processes to form a response map so that its values\nrepresent the probability of pixels being lane markers. To further improve the\nresults, the template and lane surfaces are finally refined by principal\ncomponent analysis and lane model fitting techniques. A number of experiments\nhave been conducted on both synthetic and real datasets. The result shows that\nthe proposed approach can effectively eliminate unwanted noise to accurately\ndetect lane markers in various scenarios. Moreover, the processing speed of 20\nframes per second under hardware configuration of a popular laptop computer\nallows the proposed algorithm to be implemented for real-time autonomous\ndriving applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 12:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

We employ one-dimensional radiative transfer\nmodeling - with the accelerated lambda iteration (ALI) radiative transfer code\n- of the radial abundance distribution of a total of five molecular species\n(CS, SiS, 30SiS, 29SiO and H13CN) and determine the best fitting model\nparameters based on high-resolution ALMA observations as well as archival\nsingle-dish observations. The additional advantage of the spatially resolved\nALMA observations is that we can directly constrain the radial profile of the\nobserved line transitions from the observations. Results. We derive abundances\nand e-folding radii for CS, SiS, 30SiS, 29SiO and H13CN and compare them to\nprevious studies, which are based only on unresolved single-dish spectra.

A DGP is formed by stacking\nmultiple GPs resulting in a well-regularized composition of functions. The\nBayesian framework that equips the model with attractive properties, such as\nimplicit capacity control and predictive uncertainty, makes it at the same time\nchallenging to combine with a convolutional structure. This has hindered the\napplication of DGPs in computer vision tasks, an area where deep parametric\nmodels (i.e. CNNs) have made breakthroughs. Standard kernels used in DGPs such\nas radial basis functions (RBFs) are insufficient for handling pixel\nvariability in raw images. In this paper, we build on the recent convolutional\nGP to develop Convolutional DGP (CDGP) models which effectively capture image\nlevel features through the use of convolution kernels, therefore opening up the\nway for applying DGPs to computer vision tasks. Our model learns local spatial\ninfluence and outperforms strong GP based baselines on multi-class image\nclassification. We also consider various constructions of convolution kernel\nover the image patches, analyze the computational trade-offs and provide an\nefficient framework for convolutional DGP models.

Many different process mining techniques can be\napplied to data. In current techniques, an XES event log serves as a basis for\nanalysis. However, because of the static characteristic of an XES event log, we\nneed to create one XES file for each process mining question, which leads to\noverhead and inflexibility. As an alternative, people attempt to perform\nprocess mining directly on the data source using so-called intermediate\nstructures. In previous work, we investigated methods to build intermediate\nstructures on source data by executing a basic SQL query on the database.\nHowever, the nested form in the SQL query can cause performance issues on the\ndatabase side. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a native SQL operator for\ndirect process discovery on relational databases. We define a native operator\nfor the simplest form of the intermediate structure, called the \"directly\nfollows relation\".

We seek to understand\nsome aspects of MBL from this perspective, via local propagators for the FS\nlattice and their self-energies (SE's); focusing on the SE probability\ndistributions, over disorder and FS sites. A probabilistic mean-field theory\n(MFT) is first developed, centered on self-consistent determination of the\ngeometric mean of the distribution. Despite its simplicity this captures some\nkey features of the problem, including recovery of an MBL transition, and\npredictions for the forms of the SE distributions. The problem is then studied\nnumerically in $1d$ by exact diagonalization, free from MFT assumptions. The\ngeometric mean indeed appears to act as a suitable order parameter for the\ntransition. Throughout the MBL phase the appropriate SE distribution is\nconfirmed to have a universal form, with long-tailed L\\'evy behavior as\npredicted by MFT. In the delocalized phase for weak disorder, SE distributions\nare clearly log-normal; while on approaching the transition they acquire an\nintermediate L\\'evy-tail regime, indicative of the incipient MBL phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 13:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 14:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

We compare isothermal and\nnon-isothermal 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet to\ninvestigate the influence on the feasibility of the recycling mechanism.\nRadiative cooling is implemented by using the beta cooling model.

However, in contrast to the isothermal case where the recycling\nflow reaches the deeper part of the envelope, the inflow is inhibited from\nreaching the deep envelope in the non-isothermal case. Once the atmosphere\nstarts cooling, buoyant force prevents the high-entropy disc gas from intruding\nthe low-entropy atmosphere.

Based on historical improvement rates\nof several modes of transport (Cargo Ships, Air, Rail, Trucking) a simplified\nMarkov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulation of an intermodal transport model\n(IMTM) is used to explore the effects of differing technological improvement\nrates for AS.

The IMTM simulations up to\nthe year 2050 show that the introduction of any mode of autonomous transport\nwill increase competition in lower cost shipping options, but is unlikely to\nsignificantly alter the overall distribution of transport mode costs. Secondly,\nif all forms of transport end up converting to autonomous systems, then the\nuncertainty surrounding the improvement rates yields a complex intermodal\ntransport solution involving several options, all at a much lower cost over\ntime. Ultimately, the research shows a need for more accurate measurement of\ncurrent autonomous transport costs and how they are changing over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 14:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have begun to\napproximate and even surpass human performance, but machine systems reliably\nstruggle to generalize information to untrained situations. We describe a\nneural network model that is trained to play one video game (Breakout) and\ndemonstrates one-shot generalization to a new game (Pong). The model\ngeneralizes by learning representations that are functionally and formally\nsymbolic from training data, without feedback, and without requiring that\nstructured representations be specified a priori. The model uses unsupervised\ncomparison to discover which characteristics of the input are invariant, and to\nlearn relational predicates; it then applies these predicates to arguments in a\nsymbolic fashion, using oscillatory regularities in network firing to\ndynamically bind predicates to arguments. We argue that models of human\ncognition must account for far-reaching and flexible generalization, and that\nin order to do so, models must be able to discover symbolic representations\nfrom unstructured data, a process we call predicate learning. Only then can\nmodels begin to adequately explain where human-like representations come from,\nwhy human cognition is the way it is, and why it continues to differ from\nmachine intelligence in crucial ways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 14:21:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 20:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 10:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

RPC\ndetectors have shown a good operation stability with the current gas mixture\nduring the entire Run 1 (2010$-$2013) and the ongoing Run 2 (2015$-$2018) at\nthe LHC. The gas mixture is made up of $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$, $SF_{6}$ and\n$iC_{4}H_{10}$. Since the first two gases have high Global Warming Potentials\n(GWPs), there is the risk that they will be phased out of production in the\nnext years, due to the recent restrictions and regulations of the European\nUnion. Therefore, finding a new eco-friendly gas mixture has become extremely\nimportant in order to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition,\nthe present $iC_{4}H_{10}$ contribution makes the current gas mixture\nflammable. Non-flammable components, or at least in non-flammable\nconcentrations, would be advisable to make the operation of detectors simpler\nand safer. In order to identify a gas mixture suited to cope with the\nrequirements of the ALICE Muon Identifier in the forthcoming High-Luminosity\nruns, a dedicated experimental set-up has been used to carry out R&D studies on\npromising gas mixtures with small-size RPCs. Hydrofluoroolefins ($HFOs$) are\nappropriate candidates to replace the $C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}$ thanks to their very\nlow GWPs, especially $HFO1234ze$ which is not flammable at room temperature.\nSeveral tests on $HFO$-based mixtures with addition of various gases are\nongoing and encouraging results have already been obtained.

Finally, medium-term stability\nof detectors exposed to the cosmic-ray flux will be shown in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 15:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Though convolution is clearly defined for structured data such as 2D\nimages or 3D volumes, this is not true for other data types such as sparse\npoint clouds. Previous techniques have developed approximations to convolutions\nfor restricted conditions. Unfortunately, their applicability is limited and\ncannot be used for general point clouds. We propose an efficient and effective\nmethod to learn convolutions for non-uniformly sampled point clouds, as they\nare obtained with modern acquisition techniques. Learning is enabled by four\nkey novelties: first, representing the convolution kernel itself as a\nmultilayer perceptron; second, phrasing convolution as a Monte Carlo\nintegration problem, third, using this notion to combine information from\nmultiple samplings at different levels; and fourth using Poisson disk sampling\nas a scalable means of hierarchical point cloud learning. The key idea across\nall these contributions is to guarantee adequate consideration of the\nunderlying non-uniform sample distribution function from a Monte Carlo\nperspective. To make the proposed concepts applicable to real-world tasks, we\nfurthermore propose an efficient implementation which significantly reduces the\nGPU memory required during the training process. By employing our method in\nhierarchical network architectures we can outperform most of the\nstate-of-the-art networks on established point cloud segmentation,\nclassification and normal estimation benchmarks. Furthermore, in contrast to\nmost existing approaches, we also demonstrate the robustness of our method with\nrespect to sampling variations, even when training with uniformly sampled data\nonly.

Before the\nonset of each flare, there is a reverse S-shaped filament above the polarity\ninversion line. Then the filaments become unstable and begin to rise. The\nrising filaments gain the upper hand over the tension force of the dome-like\noverlying loops and thus successfully erupt outward.

The simulation\nresults verify the accuracy of the developed analytical expressions and show\nconsiderable improvement compared to centralized shortest path routing\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 22:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

There are, however, further\nfunctions which are able to provide such codification which do not satisfy the\ndefinition of aggregation functions; this is the case of pre-aggregation and\nmixture functions.\n  In this paper we investigate two special types of functions: Generalized\nMixture and Bounded Generalized Mixture functions. They generalize both: OWA\nand Mixture functions. Both Generalized and Bounded Generalized Mixture\nfunctions are developed in such way that the weight vectors are variables\ndepending on the input vector. A special generalized mixture operator, H, is\nprovided and applied in a simple toy example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 12:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

The\nstatistical evidence here seems in general to reveal that sovereign debts and\ngovernment deficits of countries within European Monetary Unification-in\naverage- are getting worse than countries outside European Monetary\nUnification, in particular after the introduction of Euro currency. This\nsocioeconomic issue might be due to Maastricht Treaty, the Stability and Growth\nPact, the new Fiscal Compact, strict Balanced-Budget Rules, etc. In fact, this\neconomic policy of European Union, in phases of economic recession, may\ngenerate delay and rigidity in the application of prompt counter-cycle (or\nacyclical) interventions to stimulate the economy when it is in a downturn\nwithin countries. Some implications of economic policy are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 08:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

In this work, a fitness landscape analysis\nusing problem features is performed for a Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization\nAlgorithm (mBOA) on instances of MNK-landscape problem for 2, 3, 5 and 8\nobjectives. We also compare the results of mBOA with those provided by NSGA-III\nthrough the analysis of their estimated runtime necessary to identify an\napproximation of the Pareto front. Moreover, in order to scrutinize the\nprobabilistic graphic model obtained by mBOA, the Pareto front is examined\naccording to a probabilistic view. The fitness landscape study shows that mBOA\nis moderately or loosely influenced by some problem features, according to a\nsimple and a multiple linear regression model, which is being proposed to\npredict the algorithms performance in terms of the estimated runtime. Besides,\nwe conclude that the analysis of the probabilistic graphic model produced at\nthe end of evolution can be useful to understand the convergence and diversity\nperformances of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 23:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

However,\nexisting code offloading systems suffer from a long communication delay between\nmobile devices and cloud. To address this challenge, in this paper, we consider\nto deploy edge nodes in the proximity of mobile devices, and study how they\nbenefit code offloading. We design an edge-centric code offloading system,\ncalled Echo, over a three-layer computing hierarchy consisting of mobile\ndevices, edge and cloud. A critical problem needs to be addressed by Echo is to\ndecide which method should be offloaded to which computing platform (edge or\ncloud). Different from existing offloading systems that let mobile devices\nindividually make offloading decisions, Echo implements a centralized decision\nengine at the edge node. This edge-centric design can fully exploit the limited\nhardware resources at the edge to provide an offloading service with Quality of\nService guarantee. Furthermore, we propose some novel mechanisms, e.g., lazy\nobject transmission and differential object update, to further improve system\nperformance. The results of a small-scale real deployment and trace-driven\nsimulations show that Echo significantly outperforms existing\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 16:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}
