Medical imaging and, in particular, neuroscience studies\noften rely on such graph representations, with brain connectivity networks\nbeing a characteristic example, while ultimately seeking the locus of\nphenotypic or disease-related differences in the brain. These regions of\ninterest (ROIs) are, then, considered to be closely associated with function\nand/or behaviour. Driven by this, we explore GCNs for the task of ROI\nidentification and propose a visual attribution method based on class\nactivation mapping. By undertaking a sex classification task as proof of\nconcept, we show that this method can be used to identify salient nodes (brain\nregions) without prior node labels. Based on experiments conducted on\nneuroimaging data of more than 5000 participants from UK Biobank, we\ndemonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in highlighting reproducible\nregions across individuals. We further evaluate the neurobiological relevance\nof the identified regions based on evidence from large-scale UK Biobank\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 16:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

The advantage of 2D\nemission line measurements includes significant improvement of galaxy redshift\nmeasurements, approaching the level of accuracy seen in\nhigh-spectral-resolution data, but with greater efficiency; and the ability to\nidentify and measure the properties of multiple sites of star-formation and\nover scales of $\\sim$ 1 kpc within individual galaxies out to z $\\sim$ 4. The\nEM2D method also significantly improves the reliability of high-redshift\n($z\\sim7$) Lyman-$\\alpha$ detections. Coupled with the wide field of view and\nhigh efficiency of space-based grism observations, EM2D provides a noteworthy\nimprovement on the physical parameters that can be extracted from grism\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 16:23:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 17:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

From a methodological point of view, ODTLES is an approach in\nbetween Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and averaged/filtered approaches\nlike RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) or LES (Large Eddy Simulations). In\nODTLES, a set of 1D ODT models is embedded in a coarse grained 3D LES. On the\nODT scale, the turbulent advection is modeled as a sequence of stochastic eddy\nevents, also known as triplet maps, while the other (deterministic) terms are\nfully resolved in space (along the ODT- line) and time. Schmidt et al. first\n(2008) introduced ODTLES and Gonzalez et al. (2011) applied the model for a\nvariety of wall-bounded flow problems. Although the results were notable for a\nfirst proof of concept, the numerical methods used are subject to debate. First\nof all, an unstable discretization for the large scale 3D advective terms was\nused as shown by Glawe (2013). The scheme can be stabilized by reducing the CFL\nnumber for the explicitly discretized LES terms to the order of the small scale\nODT time step, but this of course reduces the advantage of the ODTLES\nmulti-scale approach. The stochastic ODT eddies were also allowed to overlap\ntwo LES cells introducing an artificial smoothing (stabilizing) effect. Glawe\n(2013) limited the overlap consistently to one LES cell and used a stable Runge\nKutta (RK) discretization, however maintaining the low CFL number problem. In\nthis paper we adapt a new implicit/explicit (IMEX) time scheme to ODTLES in\norder to remedy the small CFL number issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 16:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

We\nhypothesize that the observed distribution of red material and trends in H2O\nice band strengths results from infalling dust from Uranian irregular\nsatellites. These dust particles migrate inward on slowly decaying orbits,\neventually reaching the classical satellite zone, where they collide primarily\nwith the outer moons.

Our results and analyses\nindicate that longitudinal and planetocentric trends in reddening and H2O ice\nband strengths are broadly consistent across both southern and northern\nlatitudes of these moons, thereby supporting our hypothesis.

The\nduality gap measures the degree of intrinsic non-convexity of an optimization\nproblem: smaller gap in relative value implies lower degree of intrinsic\nnon-convexity. The challenge is to quantitatively measure the duality gap of\nhighly non-convex problems such as deep neural networks.

A formalism is introduced to describe three key\nprocesses required for an evolutionary process: the generation of a phenotype\nfrom a genetic description, the evaluation of that phenotype, and the\nreproduction with variation of individuals according to their evaluation. The\ndistinction is made between intrinsic and extrinsic implementations of these\nprocesses. A discussion then investigates how various interactions between\nthese processes, and their modes of implementation, can lead to open-endedness.\nHowever, an important contribution of the paper is the demonstration that these\nconsiderations relate to exploratory open-endedness only. Conditions for the\nimplementation of the more interesting kinds of open-endedness - expansive and\ntransformational - are also discussed, emphasizing factors such as multiple\ndomains of behaviour, transdomain bridges, and non-additive compositional\nsystems. These factors relate not to the generic evolutionary properties of\nindividuals and populations, but rather to the nature of the building blocks\nout of which individual organisms are constructed, and the laws and properties\nof the environment in which they exist.

Purpose: This work tests this proposition through next-to-leading\norder (NLO) calculations of the azimuthal distribution, $d\\sigma/d\\phi$,\nincluding transverse momentum broadening, employing $<k_T^2>$ and fragmentation\nin exclusive $Q \\bar Q$ pair production. While these studies were done for\n$p+p$, $p + \\bar p$ and $p+$Pb collisions, understanding azimuthal angle\ncorrelations between heavy quarks in these smaller, colder systems is important\nfor their interpretation in heavy-ion collisions. Methods: First, single\ninclusive $p_T$ distributions calculated with the exclusive HVQMNR code are\ncompared to those calculated in the fixed-order next-to-leading logarithm\napproach. Next the azimuthal distributions are calculated and sensitivities to\n$<k_T^2>$, $p_T$ cut, and rapidity are studied at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. Finally,\ncalculations are compared to $Q \\bar Q$ data in elementary $p+p$ and $p + \\bar\np$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and 1.96 TeV as well as to the nuclear\nmodification factor $R_{p {\\rm Pb}}(p_T)$ in $p+$Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV measured by ALICE. Results: The low $p_T$ ($p_T <\n10$ GeV) azimuthal distributions are very sensitive to the $k_T$ broadening and\nrather insensitive to the fragmentation function. The NLO contributions can\nresult in an enhancement at $\\phi \\sim 0$ absent any other effects. Agreement\nwith the data was found to be good. Conclusions: The NLO calculations, assuming\ncollinear factorization and introducing $k_T$ broadening, result in significant\nmodifications of the azimuthal distribution at low $p_T$ which must be taken\ninto account in calculations of these distributions in heavy-ion collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 19:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

The cardinality of a minimum\ndominating set of a linear system $(P,\\mathcal{L})$ is called domination number\nof $(P,\\mathcal{L})$, denoted by $\\gamma(P,\\mathcal{L})$. On the other hand, a\nsubset $R$ of lines of a linear system $(P,\\mathcal{L})$ is a 2-packing if any\nthree elements of $R$ have not a common point (are triplewise disjoint). The\ncardinality of a maximum 2-packing of a linear system $(P,\\mathcal{L})$ is\ncalled 2-packing number of $(P,\\mathcal{L})$, denoted by\n$\\nu_2(P,\\mathcal{L})$.

The general shape of penalty functions in the TWIN\nclass is the key ingredient to its desirable properties and results in improved\ntheoretical and empirical performance over existing penalties. In this work we\nintroduce two examples of TWIN penalties that admit simple and efficient\ncoordinate descent algorithms, making TWIN practical in large data settings.

Specifically, we first use primary succession to rapidly\nevolve a population of poorly initialized neural network structures into a more\ndiverse population, followed by a secondary succession stage for fine-grained\nsearching based on the networks from the primary succession. Extinction is\napplied in both stages to reduce computational cost. Mimicry is employed during\nthe entire evolution process to help the inferior networks imitate the behavior\nof a superior network and gene duplication is utilized to duplicate the learned\nblocks of novel structures, both of which help to find better network\nstructures.

The cloning algorithm allows the estimation of a large deviation\nfunction (LDF) of additive observables in Markov processes. However, such\nalgorithms are plagued by finite simulation time $t$ and finite population size\n$N_c$ effects that can render their use delicate. First, using a non-constant\npopulation approach, we analyze the small-$N_c$ effects in the initial\ntransient regime. These effects play an important role in the numerical\ndetermination of LDF. We show how to overcome these effects by introducing a\ntime delay in the evolution of populations, additional to the discarding of the\ninitial regime of the population growth where these discreteness effects are\nstrong. Then, the study of the finite-$t$ and finite-$N_c$ scalings in the LDF\nevaluation is done using two different versions of the algorithm, in discrete\nand continuous-time.

Short-reach links in data centers face strict constraints on\npower consumption, size, and cost, which will demand low-power solutions that\nscale to bit rates beyond 100 Gbit/s per wavelength, while accommodating\nincreased losses due to longer fiber plant, multiplexing of more wavelengths,\nand possibly optical switching.

Despite the importance\nof this task, manual segmentation is laborious, time-consuming and can suffer\nfrom subjectivity among pathologists. The rise of computational pathology has\nled to the development of automated methods for gland segmentation that aim to\novercome the challenges of manual segmentation. However, this task is\nnon-trivial due to the large variability in glandular appearance and the\ndifficulty in differentiating between certain glandular and non-glandular\nhistological structures. Furthermore, a measure of uncertainty is essential for\ndiagnostic decision making. To address these challenges, we propose a fully\nconvolutional neural network that counters the loss of information caused by\nmax-pooling by re-introducing the original image at multiple points within the\nnetwork. We also use atrous spatial pyramid pooling with varying dilation rates\nfor preserving the resolution and multi-level aggregation.

The performance of\nthe predictions is evaluated by the total square loss on all responses (the\nattained as well as the hidden ones). We show that a good approximate solution\nto this least squares problem can be obtained from just dimension $d$ many\nresponses by using a joint sampling technique called volume sampling. Moreover,\nthe least squares solution obtained for the volume sampled subproblem is an\nunbiased estimator of optimal solution based on all n responses.

In the last decades, researchers developed a large number of\nsegmentation algorithms for various applications. Amongst these algorithms, the\nNormalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely applied due to its good\nperformance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose\nenergy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation\nresults of the existing Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed\nsimilarity measure on the graph since this measure is usually given empirically\nby users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation results. In this\npaper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an\nadaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model\ncombines the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut\nenergy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational framework. Our method\ncan adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some\nparameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a\nbetter similarity measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide\nsome mathematical interpretation of the proposed adaptive similarity from\nmulti-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization. In addition, the\nregularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a\nrobust performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the\nsimilarity measure with a spatial priori. The well-posed theory such as the\nexistence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given in the paper.\nCompared with some existing segmentation methods such as the traditional\nNcut-based model and the classical Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments\nshow that our method can provide promising segmentation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 02:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 21:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 17:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

However,\nthese calculations are usually computationally expensive and even significant\ncomputing resources may result in a small number of independent estimates\nspread over many orders of magnitude. Such small-sample, high \"log-variance\"\ndata are not readily amenable to analysis using the standard uncertainty (i.e.,\n\"standard error of the mean\") because unphysical negative limits of confidence\nintervals result. Bootstrapping, a natural alternative guaranteed to yield a\nconfidence interval within the minimum and maximum values, also exhibits a\nstriking systematic bias of the lower confidence limit in log space.

A second alternative, the Bayesian bootstrap strategy, does not\nsuffer from the same deficit and is more logically consistent with the type of\nconfidence interval desired. The Bayesian bootstrap provides uncertainty\nintervals that are more reliable than those from the standard bootstrap method,\nbut must be used with caution nevertheless. Neither standard nor Bayesian\nbootstrapping can overcome the intrinsic challenge of under-estimating the mean\nfrom small-size, high log-variance samples.

The backward propagation\nof the dependency of observables is related to problems of statistical\ninference, so we characterize the adjoint construction as a duality between\ndynamics and inference.\n  The adjoint process corresponds to the Kolmogorov backward equation in a\ngenerating functional that erases memory from the dynamics of its underlying\ndistribution.

Nowadays, China has the longest highway mileage in the world, thus\nusing traditional manual methods to detect pavement cracks is both time and\nlabor consuming, besides, the detection results are prone to be affected by\ndetectors, which is often subjective. Meanwhile, using digital image to detect\npavement cracks may be affected by illumination and shadows, which could\ndramatically reduce the detection precision. Therefore, designing a new\ndetection method has important significance. This paper proposes a new method\nof detecting pavement cracks using high density laser point cloud. High density\nlaser point cloud can be gathered through Vehicle-borne laser scanning system,\nwhich integrates a variety types of sensors which include GNSS/INS,laser\nscanner and cameras. It can automatically collect 3-D spatial information\naround it in a high speed,it's one of the most advanced 3-D spatial information\nacquisition technologies.

High density laser point cloud are\nfirst interpolated into georeferenced feature (GRF) image, then median filter,\nmorphology, local adaptive threshold and multi scale iterative tensor voting\nmethod are used to detect pavement cracks from GRF image.

To achieve a good SNR for communication, mmWave systems use\nlarge antenna arrays. Beamforming with highly directional beams is one way to\nuse the antennas. As the channel changes over time, the beams that maximize the\nSNR have to be estimated quickly to reduce the training overhead. Prior work\nhas exploited the observation that mmWave channels are sparse to perform\ncompressed sensing (CS) based beam alignment with few channel measurements.\nMost of the existing CS-based algorithms, however, assume perfect\nsynchronization and fail in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO).\nThis paper presents Swift-Link, a fast beam alignment algorithm that is robust\nagainst the offset. Swift-Link includes a novel randomized beam training\nsequence that minimizes the beam alignment errors due to CFO and a\nlow-complexity algorithm that corrects these errors. Even with strict hardware\nconstraints, our algorithm uses fewer channel measurements than comparable CS\nalgorithms and has analytical guarantees. Swift-Link requires a small output\ndynamic range at the analog-to-digital converter compared to beam-scanning\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 04:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 02:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 04:24:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 04:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In order to resist such attack, many defenses have been\nproposed in recent years. However, these defenses incur high hardware overhead,\ndegenerate reliability and are inefficient against advanced machine learning\nattacks such as approximation attacks. In order to address these issues, we\npropose a Random Set-based Obfuscation (RSO) for Strong PUFs to resist machine\nlearning attacks. The basic idea is that several stable responses are derived\nfrom the PUF itself and pre-stored as the set for obfuscation in the testing\nphase, and then a true random number generator is used to select any two keys\nto obfuscate challenges and responses with XOR operations. When the number of\nchallenge-response pairs (CRPs) collected by the attacker exceeds the given\nthreshold, the set will be updated immediately. In this way, machine learning\nattacks can be prevented with extremely low hardware overhead. Experimental\nresults show that for a 64x64 Arbiter PUF, when the size of set is 32 and even\nif 1 million CRPs are collected by attackers, the prediction accuracies of\nLogistic regression, support vector machines, artificial neural network,\nconvolutional neural network and covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary\nstrategy are about 50% which is equivalent to the random guessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 05:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 01:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 05:53:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 04:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

More precisely, if the\ninitial function in \\eqref{eq:abstract} is additionally assumed to be radially\nsymmetric, then there exists a second constant $c^*>0$ independent of the\ndimension $N$ and the initial function $u_0$, such that \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\left\\{\\sup_{x\\in\\mathbb\nR^N}\\big|u(x,t)-\\Phi_{c_*}(|x|-c_*t+(N-1)c^*\\log t-r_0)\\big|\\right\\}=0 \\] for\nsome $r_0\\in\\mathbb{R}$ (depending on $u_0$).\n  If the initial function is not radially symmetric, then there exist $r_1,\nr_2\\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that the boundary of the spatial support of the\nsolution $u(\\cdot, t)$ is contained in the spherical shell $\\{x\\in\\mathbb R^N:\nr_1\\leq |x|-c_* t+(N-1)c^* \\log t\\leq r_2\\}$ for all $t\\ge1$. Moreover, as\n$t\\to\\infty$, $u(x,t)$ converges to $1$ uniformly in $\\big\\{|x|\\leq\nc_*t-(N-1)c\\log t\\big\\}$ for any $c>c^*$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 06:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

Here, we investigate, using\ndensity functional theory calculations, the influence of epitaxial strain on\nthe band gap of two different oxynitrides and compare our results with oxides.\nAs opposed to cubic oxides, where both compressive and tensile strain narrow\nthe band-gap, we find that the anion order leads to non-degenerate N\n\\textit{2p} bands already at zero strain, which leads to opposite and anion\norder-dependent evolutions of the band gap under compressive and tensile\nstrain. Further, we find that in oxynitrides polar distortions increase the\nband gap by up to 1 eV for 4% strain whereas for oxides the increase is only\nabout 0.1 eV for the same amount of strain. The reason for this difference is\nthe larger ionic radius of nitrogen leading to larger ferroelectric distortions\nand a stronger dependence of the band gap on the distortions amplitude. These\nresults imply that ferroelectric distortions are strongly detrimental to light\nabsorption and that their suppression, for example above a critical\ntemperature, should result in a marked decrease in band gap and enhanced\nabsorption of visible light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 08:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Over-the-barrier reactions are possible only if tunneling is\ninvoked in the description at low temperature. Therefore the rate constants for\nthe studied reactions are calculated using instanton theory that takes quantum\neffects into account inherently. The reactions were characterized in the gas\nphase, but this is expected to yield meaningful results for CO-rich ices due to\nthe minimal alteration of reaction landscapes by the CO molecules.\n  We found that rate constants should not be extrapolated based on the height\nof the barrier alone, since the shape of the barrier plays an increasingly\nlarger role at decreasing temperature.

Although it has been studied\nextensively, however, no method currently exists that can robustly predict\nvisual differences like humans. Some previous approaches used hand-coded\nmodels, but they fail to model the complexity of the human visual system.\nOthers used machine learning to train models on human-labeled datasets, but\ncreating large, high-quality datasets is difficult because people are unable to\nassign consistent error labels to distorted images. In this paper, we present a\nnew learning-based method that is the first to predict perceptual image error\nlike human observers. Since it is much easier for people to compare two given\nimages and identify the one more similar to a reference than to assign quality\nscores to each, we propose a new, large-scale dataset labeled with the\nprobability that humans will prefer one image over another. We then train a\ndeep-learning model using a novel, pairwise-learning framework to predict the\npreference of one distorted image over the other. Our key observation is that\nour trained network can then be used separately with only one distorted image\nand a reference to predict its perceptual error, without ever being trained on\nexplicit human perceptual-error labels. The perceptual error estimated by our\nnew metric, PieAPP, is well-correlated with human opinion. Furthermore, it\nsignificantly outperforms existing algorithms, beating the state-of-the-art by\nalmost 3x on our test set in terms of binary error rate, while also\ngeneralizing to new kinds of distortions, unlike previous learning-based\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 08:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

Although its\nexistence is formally guaranteed for certain systems, methods to determine it\nare hardly available. One practical approach is the Least-Squares Shadowing\n(LSS) algorithm (Q Wang, SIAM J Numer Anal 52, 156, 2014), whereby the\nshadowing direction is approximated by the solution of the sensitivity\nequations with the least square average norm. Here, we present an alternative,\npotentially simpler shadowing-based algorithm, termed periodic shadowing. The\nkey idea is to obtain a bounded solution of the sensitivity equations by\ncomplementing it with periodic boundary conditions in time. We show that this\nis not only justifiable when the reference trajectory is itself periodic, but\nalso possible and effective for chaotic trajectories. Our error analysis shows\nthat periodic shadowing has the same convergence rates as LSS when the time\nspan $T$ is increased: the sensitivity error first decays as $1/T$ and then,\nasymptotically as $1/\\sqrt{T}$. We demonstrate the approach on the Lorenz\nequations, and also show that, as $T$ tends to infinity, periodic shadowing\nsensitivities converge to the same value obtained from long unstable periodic\norbits (D Lasagna, SIAM J Appl Dyn Syst 17, 1, 2018) for which there is no\nshadowing error. Finally, finite-difference approximations of the sensitivity\nare also examined, and we show that subtle non-hyperbolicity features of the\nLorenz system introduce a small, yet systematic, bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 09:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The attractive part of the interaction is calculated by parameterizing\nthe two body phase shifts using K-matrix formalism while the repulsive part is\nincluded by fitting to the experimental phase shifts which carry the\ninformation about the nature of the interaction. We find that the bulk\nthermodynamic variables for a gas of hadrons such as energy density, pressure,\nentropy density, speed of sound and specific heat are suppressed by the\ninclusion of repulsive interactions and are more pronounced for second and\nhigher order correlations and fluctuations, particularly for the observables\n$\\chi^2_Q$, $\\chi^2_B-\\chi^4_B$ and $C_{BS}$ in the present model.

Over the last few decades, several graph-based two-sample tests\nhave been proposed in the literature, which can be used for data of arbitrary\ndimensions. Most of these test statistics are computed using pairwise Euclidean\ndistances among the observations. But, due to concentration of pairwise\nEuclidean distances, these tests have poor performance in many high-dimensional\nproblems. Some of them can have powers even below the nominal level when the\nscale-difference between two distributions dominates the location-difference.\nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce a new class of dissimilarity\nindices and use it to modify some popular graph-based tests. These modified\ntests use the distance concentration phenomenon to their advantage, and as a\nresult, they outperform the corresponding tests based on the Euclidean distance\nin a wide variety of examples. We establish the high-dimensional consistency of\nthese modified tests under fairly general conditions.

The magnitudes of these earthquakes are usually lower than tectonic\nearthquakes that can occur in high seismic regions; however, such induced\nearthquakes can occur in areas that historically have had negligible\nseismicity. Thus, the infrastructure in these locations was likely designed for\nno to low seismic demands, making them vulnerable to seismic damage. Ongoing\nresearch is aimed at evaluating the vulnerability bridge infrastructure to\nthese human induced seismic hazards.

It is a task to model students' mastery level of a\nknowledge component (KC) based on their historical learning trajectories. In\nrecent years, a recurrent neural network model called deep knowledge tracing\n(DKT) has been proposed to handle the knowledge tracing task and literature has\nshown that DKT generally outperforms traditional methods. However, through our\nextensive experimentation, we have noticed two major problems in the DKT model.\nThe first problem is that the model fails to reconstruct the observed input. As\na result, even when a student performs well on a KC, the prediction of that\nKC's mastery level decreases instead, and vice versa. Second, the predicted\nperformance for KCs across time-steps is not consistent. This is undesirable\nand unreasonable because student's performance is expected to transit gradually\nover time. To address these problems, we introduce regularization terms that\ncorrespond to reconstruction and waviness to the loss function of the original\nDKT model to enhance the consistency in prediction. Experiments show that the\nregularized loss function effectively alleviates the two problems without\ndegrading the original task of DKT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 13:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

Since human\ncognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas\ncould benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations.

To address this\nproblem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas\nfrom interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative\nmodeling.

Our understanding of the ways that new genetic material\nappears and how that genetic material shapes population variation remains\nincomplete. De novo genes and duplicate genes are a key source of new genetic\nmaterial on which selection acts. To better understand the origins of these new\ngene sequences, we explored the ways that structural variation might alter\nexpression patterns and form novel transcripts. We provide evidence that\nchromosomal rearrangements are a source of novel genetic variation that\nfacilitates the formation of de novo genes in Drosophila. We identify 52 cases\nof de novo gene formation created by chromosomal rearrangements in 14 strains\nof D. yakuba. These new genes inherit transcription start signals and open\nreading frames when the 5' end of existing genes are combined with previously\nuntranscribed regions. Such new genes would appear with novel peptide\nsequences, without the necessity for secondary transitions from non-coding RNA\nto protein. This mechanism of new peptide formations contrasts with canonical\ntheory of de novo gene progression requiring non-coding intermediaries that\nmust acquire new mutations prior to loss via pseudogenization. Hence, these\nmutations offer a means to de novo gene creation and protein sequence formation\nin a single mutational step, answering a long standing open question concerning\nnew gene formation. We further identify gene expression changes to 134 existing\ngenes, indicating that these mutations can alter gene regulation. Population\nvariability for chromosomal rearrangements is considerable, with 2368\nrearrangements observed across 14 inbred lines. More rearrangements were\nidentified on the X chromosome than any of the autosomes, suggesting the X is\nmore susceptible to chromosome alterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 14:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 01:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 23:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 17:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

Around the Gaussian fixed\npoint, RG properties of the conformal factor of the metric allow the\nconstruction of a Hilbert space $\\mathfrak{L}$ of renormalizable interactions,\nnon-perturbative in $\\hbar$, and involving arbitrarily high powers of the\ngravitational fluctuations. We show that diffeomorphism invariance is violated\nfor interactions that lie inside $\\mathfrak{L}$, in the sense that only a\ntrivial quantum BRST cohomology exists for interactions at first order in the\ncouplings.

The influence of the elastic energy due\nto strain in the crystalline membrane is studied for increasing tensile stress\nand for rising temperature (thermal expansion).

The\nnon-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects of Cu I lines are\ninvestigated, and line formation calculations are presented for an atomic model\nof copper including 97 terms and 1089 line transitions. We adopted the recently\ncalculated photo-ionization cross-sections of Cu I, and investigated the\nhydrogen collision by comparing the theoretical and observed line profiles of\nour sample stars. The copper abundances are derived for both local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and NLTE based on the spectrum synthesis\nmethods. Our results show that the NLTE effects for Cu I lines are important\nfor metal-poor stars, in particular for very metal-poor stars, and these\neffects depend on the metallicity. For very metal-poor stars, the NLTE\nabundance correction reaches as large as ~ +0.5 dex compared to standard LTE\ncalculations.

In this study, we combined\nwater level data from CryoSat-2 with various observations from other altimeter\nmissions in the Mekong River Basin between 2008 and 2016 into one multi-mission\nwater level time series using the approach of universal kriging.

In constrained\ncounting, the task is to compute the total weight, subject to a given weighting\nfunction, of the set of solutions of the given constraints. In constrained\nsampling, the task is to sample randomly, subject to a given weighting\nfunction, from the set of solutions to a set of given constraints.\nConsequently, constrained counting and sampling have been subject to intense\ntheoretical and empirical investigations over the years. Prior work, however,\noffered either heuristic techniques with poor guarantees of accuracy or\napproaches with proven guarantees but poor performance in practice.\n  In this thesis, we introduce a novel hashing-based algorithmic framework for\nconstrained sampling and counting that combines the classical algorithmic\ntechnique of universal hashing with the dramatic progress made in combinatorial\nreasoning tools, in particular, SAT and SMT, over the past two decades. The\nresulting frameworks for counting (ApproxMC2) and sampling (UniGen) can handle\nformulas with up to million variables representing a significant boost up from\nthe prior state of the art tools' capability to handle few hundreds of\nvariables. If the initial set of constraints is expressed as Disjunctive Normal\nForm (DNF), ApproxMC is the only known Fully Polynomial Randomized\nApproximation Scheme (FPRAS) that does not involve Monte Carlo steps. By\nexploiting the connection between definability of formulas and variance of the\ndistribution of solutions in a cell defined by 3-universal hash functions, we\nintroduced an algorithmic technique, MIS, that reduced the size of XOR\nconstraints employed in the underlying universal hash functions by as much as\ntwo orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 15:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

A differentially private ADMM was proposed in prior work\n(Zhang & Zhu, 2017) where only the privacy loss of a single node during one\niteration was bounded, a method that makes it difficult to balance the tradeoff\nbetween the utility attained through distributed computation and privacy\nguarantees when considering the total privacy loss of all nodes over the entire\niterative process.

In this paper we aim to assess the value of\nMASCARA data for studying variable stars by determining to what extent known\nvariable stars can be recovered and characterised, and how well new, unknown\nvariables can be discovered. We used the first 14 months of MASCARA data,\nconsisting of the light curves of 53 401 stars with up to one million flux\npoints per object. All stars were cross-matched with the VSX catalogue to\nidentify known variables. The MASCARA light curves were searched for periodic\nflux variability using generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms. If significant\nvariability of a known variable was detected, the found period and amplitude\nwere compared with those listed in the VSX database. If no previous record of\nvariability was found, the data were phase folded to attempt a classification.\nOf the 1919 known variable stars in the MASCARA sample with periods $0.1<P<10$\ndays, amplitudes $>2\\%$, and that have more than 80 hours of data, $93.5\\%$ are\nrecovered. In addition, the periods of $210$ stars without a previous VSX\nrecord were determined, and $282$ candidate variable stars were newly\nidentified. The O'Connell effect is seen in seven eclipsing binaries, of which\ntwo have no previous record of this effect. MASCARA data are very well suited\nto study known variable stars. They also serve as a powerful means to find new\nvariables among the brightest stars in the sky. Follow-up is required to ensure\nthat the observed variability does not originate from faint background objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 15:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Theoretically, the tight regret lower-bound\nfor the general bandit is polynomial with respect to the number of arms\n$|\\mathcal{A}|$. This makes bandit incapable of handling an exponentially large\nnumber of arms, hence the bandit problem with side-information is often\nconsidered to overcome this lower bound. Recently, a bandit framework over a\ncausal graph was introduced, where the structure of the causal graph is\navailable as side-information. A causal graph is a fundamental model that is\nfrequently used with a variety of real problems. In this setting, the arms are\nidentified with interventions on a given causal graph, and the effect of an\nintervention propagates throughout all over the causal graph. The task is to\nfind the best intervention that maximizes the expected value on a target node.\nExisting algorithms for causal bandit overcame the\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{A}|/T})$ simple-regret lower-bound; however, their\nalgorithms work only when the interventions $\\mathcal{A}$ are localized around\na single node (i.e., an intervention propagates only to its neighbors).\n  We propose a novel causal bandit algorithm for an arbitrary set of\ninterventions, which can propagate throughout the causal graph.

Unlike the original adversarial patch that only manipulates\nimage-level classifier, our DPatch simultaneously attacks the bounding box\nregression and object classification so as to disable their predictions.\nCompared to prior works, DPatch has several appealing properties: (1) DPatch\ncan perform both untargeted and targeted effective attacks, degrading the mAP\nof Faster R-CNN and YOLO from 75.10% and 65.7% down to below 1%, respectively.\n(2) DPatch is small in size and its attacking effect is location-independent,\nmaking it very practical to implement real-world attacks. (3) DPatch\ndemonstrates great transferability among different detectors as well as\ntraining datasets. For example, DPatch that is trained on Faster R-CNN can\neffectively attack YOLO, and vice versa. Extensive evaluations imply that\nDPatch can perform effective attacks under black-box setup, i.e., even without\nthe knowledge of the attacked network's architectures and parameters.\nSuccessful realization of DPatch also illustrates the intrinsic vulnerability\nof the modern detector architectures to such patch-based adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 17:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 01:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 03:08:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 16:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

In\nthis paper we propose a new network structure called Attention Incorporate\nNetwork(AIN). It solve the problem of different size of inputs including:\nimages, text, audio, and extract the key features of the inputs by attention\nmechanism, pay different attention depends on the importance of the features\nnot rely on the data size. Experimentally, AIN achieve a higher accuracy,\nbetter convergence comparing to the same size of other network structure\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 11:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

The aim of this\nstudy is to develop numerical and experimental methods to fundamentally\ninvestigate the sound insulation property of the pyramidal lattice sandwich\nstructure with solid trusses (PLSSST). A finite element model has been\ndeveloped to predict the sound transmission loss (STL) of PLSSST and simulation\nresults have been compared with those obtained experimentally.
