For instance, the funnel that is generated\nin some highly magnetized disks configurations whereby relativistic jets are\nthought to spread, or in pulsars where the fluids are subject to very intense\nmagnetic fields. With the aim of dealing with magnetic media in the\nastrophysical context, we present for the first time the conservative form of\nthe GRMHD equations with a non-zero magnetic polarization vector $m^{\\mu}$.\nThen, we follow the Anile method to compute the eigenvalue structure in the\ncase where the magnetic polarization is parallel to the magnetic field, and it\nis parametrized by the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_m$. This approximation\nallows us to describe diamagnetic fluids, for which $\\chi_m<0$, and\nparamagnetic fluids where $\\chi_m>0$. The theoretical results were implemented\nin the CAFE code to study the role of the magnetic polarization in some 1D\nRiemann problems. We found that independently of the initial condition, the\nfirst waves that appear in the numerical solutions are faster in diamagnetic\nmaterials than in paramagnetic ones. Moreover, the constant states between the\nwaves change notably for different magnetic susceptibilities. All these effects\nare more appreciable if the magnetic pressure is much bigger than the fluid\npressure. Additionally, with the aim of analysing a magnetic media in a strong\ngravitational field, we carry out for the first time the magnetized Michel\naccretion of a magnetically polarized fluid.

Inspired by this, we present a new family of analytical\nmodels for thin disks composed by magnetized material.

The variable selection problem is\nmost familiar in parametric environments such as the linear model or additive\nvariants thereof. In this work, we abandon the linear model framework, which\ncan be quite detrimental when the covariates impact the outcome in a non-linear\nway, and turn to tree-based methods for variable selection. Such variable\nscreening is traditionally done by pruning down large trees or by ranking\nvariables based on some importance measure. Despite heavily used in practice,\nthese ad-hoc selection rules are not yet well understood from a theoretical\npoint of view. In this work, we devise a Bayesian tree-based probabilistic\nmethod and show that it is consistent for variable selection when the\nregression surface is a smooth mix of $p>n$ covariates. These results are the\nfirst model selection consistency results for Bayesian forest priors.\nProbabilistic assessment of variable importance is made feasible by a\nspike-and-slab wrapper around sum-of-trees priors. Sampling from posterior\ndistributions over trees is inherently very difficult. As an alternative to\nMCMC, we propose ABC Bayesian Forests, a new ABC sampling method based on\ndata-splitting that achieves higher ABC acceptance rate. We show that the\nmethod is robust and successful at finding variables with high marginal\ninclusion probabilities. Our ABC algorithm provides a new avenue towards\napproximating the median probability model in non-parametric setups where the\nmarginal likelihood is intractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 17:09:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 22:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 02:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 16:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

Such methods usually stop at checking parameter signs,\nmodel elasticities, and ratios of model coefficients. In this paper, I greatly\nexpand the discrete choice modelers' assessment toolkit by introducing model\nchecking procedures based on graphical displays of predictive simulations.\n  Overall, my contributions are as follows.

In contrast to the standard ideal linear\nenergy harvesting (EH) model, we consider practical non-linear EH models. We\ninvestigate this problem under two different frameworks: i) an optimization\napproach where the energy beacon knows the utility function of the nodes,\nchannel state information and the energy harvesting characteristics of the\ndevices; hence optimal power allocation strategies can be designed using an\noptimization problem and ii) a learning approach where the energy beacon\ndecides on its strategies adaptively with battery level information and\nfeedback on the utility function. Our results illustrate that deep\nreinforcement learning approach can obtain the same error levels with the\noptimization approach and provides a promising alternative to the optimization\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 17:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

The motivation for this research stems from the significant changes\nin the new SSI provisions of ASCE 7-16 compared to the previous 2010 edition.\nGenerally, ASCE 7 considers SSI as a beneficial effect, and allows designer to\nreduce the design base shear. However, literature shows that this idea cannot\nproperly capture the SSI effects on nonlinear systems. ASCE 7-16 is the first\nedition of ASCE 7 that considers the SSI effect on yielding systems. This study\ninvestigates the consequences of practicing the new provisions on a wide range\nof buildings with different dynamic characteristics on different soil types.\nDuctility demand of the structure forms the performance metric of this study,\nand the probability that practicing SSI provisions, in lieu of fixed-base\nprovisions, increases the ductility demand of the structure is computed. The\nanalyses are conducted within a probabilistic framework which considers the\nuncertainties in the ground motion and in the properties of the soil-structure\nsystem. It is concluded that, for structures with surface foundation on\nmoderate to soft soils, SSI regulations of both ASCE 7-10 and ASCE 7-16 are\nfairly likely to result in a similar and larger structural responses than those\nobtained by practicing the fixed-base design regulations. However, for squat\nand ordinary stiff structures on soft soil or structures with embedded\nfoundation on moderate to soft soils, the SSI provisions of ASCE 7-16 result in\nperformance levels that are closer to those obtained by practicing the\nfixed-base regulations. Finally, for structures on very soft soils, the new SSI\nprovisions of ASCE 7-16 are likely to rather conservative designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 07:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of\nradiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger\nsimulations. Simulations rely instead on approximate transport algorithms with\nunquantified modeling errors. In this paper, we use for the first time a\ntime-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve\nBoltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino\ndistribution function ~10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple\nthe MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the\nmerger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment\ntransport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment\nscheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere.\nWhile the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the\ntwo-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at\nlower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of\nneutrinos in the polar regions by ~50%, and underestimates the neutrino\npair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is\nsignificantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our\nresults indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for\nthe creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by\nerrors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model\nkilonovae and gamma-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

These\nplanetesimals in the parent belt of debris disks orbit their host star and\ncontinuously supply the disk with fine dust through their mutual collisions.\n  Aims: We aim to understand effects of different collisional parameters on the\nobservational appearance of eccentric debris disks.\n  Methods: The collisional evolution of selected debris disk configurations was\nsimulated with the numerical code ACE. Subsequently, selected observable\nquantities are simulated with our newly developed code DMS. The impact of the\neccentricity, dynamical excitation, and the material strength is discussed with\nrespect to the grain size distribution, the spectral energy distribution, and\nspatially resolved images of debris disk systems.\n  Results: The most recognizable features in different collisional evolutions\nare as follows. First, both the increase of dynamical excitation in the\neccentric belt of the debris disk system and the decrease of the material\nstrength of dust particles result in a higher production rate of smaller\nparticles. This reduces the surface brightness differences between the\nperiastron and the apastron sides of the disks. For very low material\nstrengths, the \"pericenter glow\" phenomenon is reduced and eventually even\nreplaced by the opposite effect, the \"apocenter glow\". Second, it is possible\nto constrain the level of collisional activity from the appearance of the disk,\nfor example, the wavelength-dependent apocenter-to-pericenter flux ratio.\nWithin the considered parameter space, the impact of the material strength on\nthe appearance of the disk is stronger than that of dynamical excitation of the\nsystem. Finally, we find that the impact of the collisional parameters on the\nnet spectral energy distribution is weak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 19:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

An AI system performing the OODA process requires a\nsemantically rich representation to handle a complex real world situation and\nability to reason under uncertainty about the situation. Multi-Entity Bayesian\nNetworks (MEBNs) combines First-Order Logic with Bayesian Networks for\nrepresenting and reasoning about uncertainty in complex, knowledge-rich\ndomains. MEBN goes beyond standard Bayesian networks to enable reasoning about\nan unknown number of entities interacting with each other in various types of\nrelationships, a key requirement for the OODA process of an AI system. MEBN\nmodels have heretofore been constructed manually by a domain expert. However,\nmanual MEBN modeling is labor-intensive and insufficiently agile. To address\nthese problems, an efficient method is needed for MEBN modeling. One of the\nmethods is to use machine learning to learn a MEBN model in whole or in part\nfrom data. In the era of Big Data, data-rich environments, characterized by\nuncertainty and complexity, have become ubiquitous. The larger the data sample\nis, the more accurate the results of the machine learning approach can be.\nTherefore, machine learning has potential to improve the quality of MEBN models\nas well as the effectiveness for MEBN modeling. In this research, we study a\nMEBN learning framework to develop a MEBN model from a combination of domain\nexpert's knowledge and data. To evaluate the MEBN learning framework, we\nconduct an experiment to compare the MEBN learning framework and the existing\nmanual MEBN modeling in terms of development efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 20:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

Recent methods have gained significant\nimprovement by exploring image-level information and hierarchical features from\ndeep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). These methods model depth\nestimation as a regression problem and train the regression networks by\nminimizing mean squared error, which suffers from slow convergence and\nunsatisfactory local solutions. Besides, existing depth estimation networks\nemploy repeated spatial pooling operations, resulting in undesirable\nlow-resolution feature maps. To obtain high-resolution depth maps,\nskip-connections or multi-layer deconvolution networks are required, which\ncomplicates network training and consumes much more computations. To eliminate\nor at least largely reduce these problems, we introduce a spacing-increasing\ndiscretization (SID) strategy to discretize depth and recast depth network\nlearning as an ordinal regression problem. By training the network using an\nordinary regression loss, our method achieves much higher accuracy and\n\\dd{faster convergence in synch}. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-scale network\nstructure which avoids unnecessary spatial pooling and captures multi-scale\ninformation in parallel.\n  The method described in this paper achieves state-of-the-art results on four\nchallenging benchmarks, i.e., KITTI [17], ScanNet [9], Make3D [50], and NYU\nDepth v2 [42], and win the 1st prize in Robust Vision Challenge 2018.

A Multi-Entity Bayesian Network (MEBN) is a knowledge\nrepresentation formalism combining Bayesian Networks (BN) with First-Order\nLogic (FOL). MEBN can be used to represent uncertain situations (supported by\nBN) as well as complex situations (supported by FOL). Also, efficient reasoning\nalgorithms for MEBN have been developed. MEBN can be a formal representation to\nsupport PSAW and has been used for several PSAW systems. Although several MEBN\napplications for PSAW exist, very little work can be found in the literature\nthat attempts to generalize a MEBN model to support PSAW. In this research, we\ndefine a reference model for MEBN in PSAW, called a PSAW-MEBN reference model.\nThe PSAW-MEBN reference model enables us to easily develop a MEBN model for\nPSAW by supporting the design of a MEBN model for PSAW. In this research, we\nintroduce two example use cases using the PSAW-MEBN reference model to develop\nMEBN models to support PSAW: a Smart Manufacturing System and a Maritime Domain\nAwareness System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 23:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 00:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

Very short baseline reactor experiments, like SoLid, look for active\nto sterile neutrino oscillation signatures in the anti-neutrino energy spectrum\nas a function of the distance to the core and energy. Performing a precise\nsearch requires high light yield of the scintillating elements and uniformity\nof the response in the detector volume. The SoLid experiment uses an innovative\nhybrid technology with two different scintillators: polyvinyltoluene\nscintillator cubes and $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screens. A precision test bench based on\na $^{207}$Bi calibration source has been developed to study improvements on the\nenergy resolution and uniformity of the prompt scintillation signal of\nantineutrino interactions.

We introduce and study two algorithms: Accelerated\nSemi-Greedy Coordinate Descent (ASCD) and Accelerated Greedy Coordinate Descent\n(AGCD). While ASCD takes greedy steps in the $x$-updates and randomized steps\nin the $z$-updates, AGCD is a straightforward extension of standard greedy\ncoordinate descent that only takes greedy steps. On the theory side, our main\nresults are for ASCD: we show that ASCD achieves $O(1/k^2)$ convergence, and it\nalso achieves accelerated linear convergence for strongly convex functions. On\nthe empirical side, we observe that both AGCD and ASCD outperform Accelerated\nRandomized Coordinate Descent on a variety of instances. In particular, we note\nthat AGCD significantly outperforms the other accelerated coordinate descent\nmethods in numerical tests, in spite of a lack of theoretical guarantees for\nthis method. To complement the empirical study of AGCD, we present a Lyapunov\nenergy function argument that points to an explanation for why a direct\nextension of the acceleration proof for AGCD does not work; and we also\nintroduce a technical condition under which AGCD is guaranteed to have\naccelerated convergence.

The malicious exploit of\nthis crosstalk by repeatedly accessing a row to induce this effect is known as\nrow hammering. Additionally, inadvertent row hammering may also occur due to\nthe natural weighted nature of applications' access patterns.\n  In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of existing approaches for\nmitigating wordline crosstalk and demonstrate that they have been\nconservatively designed. Given the unbalanced nature of DRAM accesses, a small\ngroup of dynamically allocated counters in banks can deterministically detect\nhot rows and mitigate crosstalk. Based on our findings, we propose a\nCounter-based Adaptive Tree (CAT) approach to mitigate wordline crosstalk using\nadaptive trees of counters to guide appropriate refreshing of vulnerable rows.\nThe key idea is to tune the distribution of the counters to the rows in a bank\nbased on the memory reference patterns. In contrast to deterministic solutions,\nCAT utilizes fewer counters, making it practically feasible to be implemented\non-chip. Compared to existing probabilistic approaches, CAT more precisely\nrefreshes rows vulnerable to crosstalk based on their access frequency.\n  Experimental results on workloads from four benchmark suites show that CAT\nreduces the Crosstalk Mitigation Refresh Power Overhead in quad-core systems to\n7%, which is an improvement over the 21% and 18% incurred in the leading\ndeterministic and probabilistic approaches, respectively. Moreover, CAT incurs\nvery low performance overhead (0.5%).

Considering that the TNN based Tensor Robust PCA\n[Lu et al., 2018a] is an elegant extension of Robust PCA with a similar tight\nrecovery bound, it is natural to solve other low rank tensor recovery problems\nextended from the matrix cases. However, the extensions and proofs are\ngenerally tedious. The general atomic norm provides a unified view of\nlow-complexity structures induced norms, e.g., the $\\ell_1$-norm and nuclear\nnorm. The sharp estimates of the required number of generic measurements for\nexact recovery based on the atomic norm are known in the literature.

In this work, using both experiments\nand numerical simulations, we \\textit{quantitatively} study the dissolution\ndynamics of femtoliter surface droplets in a highly ordered array under a\nuniform flow. Our results show that the dissolution of femoliter droplets\nstrongly depends on their spatial positions relative to the flow direction,\ndrop-to-drop spacing in the array, and the imposed flow rate. In some\nparticular case, the droplet at the edge of the array can dissolve about 30%\nfaster than the ones located near the centre. The dissolution rate of the\ndroplet increases by 60% as the inter-droplet spacing is increased from 2.5\n$\\mu$m to 20 $\\mu$m. Moreover, the droplets close to the front of flow commence\nto shrink earlier than those droplets in the center of the array. The average\ndissolution rate is faster for faster flow. As a result, the dissolution time\n$T_{i}$ decreases with the Reynolds number Re of the flow as $T_{i}\\propto\nRe^{-3/4}$. The experimental results are in good agreement with numerical\nsimulations where the advection-diffusion equation for the concentration field\nis solved and the concentration gradient on the surface of the drop is\ncomputed.

For edge-on orbits we also consider modifications of the\nShapiro delay which take the lensing effects into account. Our results are then\nused to assess the accuracy of the different orders of the post-Newtonian\napproximation of the propagation delay. This comparison indicates that for\n(nearly) edge-on orbits the new exact delay formula should be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 07:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 14:14:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 10:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

At higher velocities the flow field is\nmodified by excitations that are created when the flow velocity locally exceeds\n$v_L$. The flow field causes Andreev reflection of quasiparticles and thus\nleads to change in the drag force. We calculate multiple limiting cases for a\ncylinder-shaped object.

To tackle\nthis problem, cross-lingual sentiment classification approaches aim to transfer\nknowledge learned from one language that has abundant labeled examples (i.e.,\nthe source language, usually English) to another language with fewer labels\n(i.e., the target language). The source and the target languages are usually\nbridged through off-the-shelf machine translation tools. Through such a\nchannel, cross-language sentiment patterns can be successfully learned from\nEnglish and transferred into the target languages. This approach, however,\noften fails to capture sentiment knowledge specific to the target language, and\nthus compromises the accuracy of the downstream classification task. In this\npaper, we employ emojis, which are widely available in many languages, as a new\nchannel to learn both the cross-language and the language-specific sentiment\npatterns. We propose a novel representation learning method that uses emoji\nprediction as an instrument to learn respective sentiment-aware representations\nfor each language.

Here we present the first quantitative\nstudy of internal rotation on the plane-of-the-sky for a large sample of\nglobular clusters using proper motions from Gaia DR2. We detect signatures of\nrotation in the tangential component of proper motions for 11 out of 51\nclusters at a $>$3-sigma confidence level, confirming the detection reported in\nGaia collaboration et al.

Amplify and forward relay is not affordable in terms of power\nconsumption and performance, because it consumes a lot of power inefficiently\nand enhances the noise.

In comparison, the Dirac\nprobability can exhibit high-frequency oscillation in the dimerized region.\nThese phenomena demonstrate the dynamical signature and provide insightful\ninformation of the moire pattern in the non-Hermitian regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 10:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

The rest part can be implemented in an FPGA (Field\nProgrammable Gate Array). Leakage current from the sensor would cause the base\nline drifting slowly, which can influence the measuring precision. Our method\nsolve this problem without losing the linearity of measurement. We have built\nthe circuit and experimental setup for evaluation. Using them to measure energy\nspectrums of PET detectors of PMT coupled with LYSO and LaBr3 crystal, the\nenergy resolution is 12.67% and 5.17% respectively. The test results show that\nour circuit is rather simple, stable and conducive for multi-channel\nintegration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 11:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a $10\\times \\sim 100\\times$ faster network embedding\nmethod, called Progle, by elegantly utilizing the sparsity property of online\nnetworks and spectral analysis. In Progle, we first construct a \\textit{sparse}\nproximity matrix and train the network embedding efficiently via sparse matrix\ndecomposition. Then we introduce a network propagation pattern via spectral\nanalysis to incorporate local and global structure information into the\nembedding. Besides, this model can be generalized to integrate network\ninformation into other insufficiently trained embeddings at speed. Benefiting\nfrom sparse spectral network embedding, our experiment on four different\ndatasets shows that Progle outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art\nunsupervised comparison approaches---DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, GraRep, and\nHOPE, regarding accuracy, while is $10\\times$ faster than the fastest\nword2vec-based method.

A particular challenge is represented by underwater acoustic networks\n(UWANs), which are often left unattended over long periods of time. Currently,\ndue to physical and performance limitations, UWAC packets rarely include\nencryption, leaving the UWAN exposed to external attacks faking legitimate\nmessages. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for message authentication\nin a UWAN setting. We begin by observing that, due to the strong spatial\ndependency of the underwater acoustic channel, an attacker can attempt to mimic\nthe channel associated with the legitimate transmitter only for a small set of\nreceivers, typically just for a single one. Taking this into account, our\nscheme relies on trusted nodes that independently help a sink node in the\nauthentication process. For each incoming packet, the sink fuses beliefs\nevaluated by the trusted nodes to reach an authentication decision. These\nbeliefs are based on estimated statistical channel parameters, chosen to be the\nmost sensitive to the transmitter-receiver displacement.

We present a\ngeometric modification of the presented algorithm which can be used without a\npseudo-inverse. As such, the complete algorithm can be implemented for\nlow-level hardware without the need of a linear algebra package that supports\nthe calculation of matrix inverse. Both algorithms are applied for head motion\ncompensation and the runtime of both is compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 12:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 08:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

This semantics models a high-level understanding of\nownership and as a result is close to source-level Rust (but with full type\nannotations) which differs from the recent RustBelt effort that essentially\nmodels MIR, a CPS-style IR used in the Rust compiler. Further, while RustBelt\naims to verify the safety of unsafe code in Rust's standard library, we model\nstandard library APIs as primitives, which is sufficient to reason about their\nbehavior. This yields a simpler model of Rust and its type system that we think\nresearchers will find easier to use as a starting point for investigating Rust\nextensions. Unlike RustBelt, we aim to prove type soundness using progress and\npreservation instead of a Kripke logical relation. Finally, our semantics is a\nfamily of languages of increasing expressive power, where subsequent levels\nhave features that are impossible to define in previous levels.

In this work, we focus on the first photofragmentation\nsteps, which involve the dehydrogenation of these molecules. For this, we\nconsider a multidisciplinary approach, taking into account the results from\nexperiments, DFT calculations, and modeling using dedicated Monte-Carlo\nsimulations.

These comprise nine PAHs with clearly different structural\nproperties. The formation of aliphatic-like side groups is found to be critical\nin the first fragmentation step and, furthermore, sets the balance of the\ncompetition between H- and H2-loss. We show that the presence of trio\nhydrogens, especially in combination with bay regions in small PAHs plays an\nimportant part in the experimentally established variations in the odd-to-even\nH-atom loss ratios. In addition, we find that, as PAH size increases, H2\nformation becomes dominant, and sequential hydrogen loss only plays a marginal\nrole. We also find disagreements between experiments and calculations for\nlarge, solo containing PAHs, which need to be accounted for. In order to match\ntheoretical and experimental results, we have modified the energy barriers and\nrestricted the H-hopping to tertiary atoms.

Due to the wide range of the dispersed\nphonon mean free paths, the phonon transport under the non-gray model is\nessentially multiscale, and has to be solved differently and appropriately for\nvaried phonon frequencies and branches. The proposed implicit kinetic scheme is\ncomposed of a microscopic iteration and a macroscopic iteration. The\nmicroscopic iteration is capable of automatically adapting with varied phonon\nmean free path of each phonon frequency and branch through solving the phonon\nBTE. The energy transfer of all phonons is gathered together by the microscopic\niteration to evaluate the heat flux. The temperature field is predicted through\na macroscopic heat transfer equation according to the heat flux, and the\nequilibrium state in the phonon BTE is also updated. The combination of the\nphonon BTE solver and the macroscopic equation makes the present method very\nefficient in a wide length scale. Three numerical tests, including the\ncross-plane, in-plane and nano-porous heat transfer in silicon, validate that\nthe present scheme can handle with the phonon dispersion and polarization\ncorrectly and predict the multiscale heat transfer phenomena efficiently in a\nwide range.

It is often realised by sequence alignment techniques, which are\ncomputationally expensive. This has led to increased research into\nalignment-free techniques, which are based on measures referring to the\ncomposition of sequences in terms of their constituent patterns. These\nmeasures, such as $q$-gram distance, are usually computed in time linear with\nrespect to the length of the sequences. In this paper, we focus on the\ncomplementary idea: how two sequences can be efficiently compared based on\ninformation that does not occur in the sequences. A word is an {\\em absent\nword} of some sequence if it does not occur in the sequence. An absent word is\n{\\em minimal} if all its proper factors occur in the sequence.

In this paper, we carefully study the intrinsic\nthermal conductance across metal/graphene/metal interfaces to identify the heat\ntransport mechanisms across graphene interfaces. We find that unlike metal\ncontacts on diamond, the intrinsic thermal conductance of most graphene\ninterfaces (except Ti and TiNx) is only about 50 % of the phonon radiation\nlimit, suggesting that heat is carried across graphene interfaces mainly\nthrough elastic transmission of phonons. We thus propose a convenient approach\nto substantially enhance the phononic heat transport across metal contacts on\ngraphene, by better matching the energy of phonons in metals and graphene,\ne.g., using metallic nitrides. We test the idea with TiNx, with phonon\nfrequencies of up to 1.18*10^14 rad/s, 47 % of the highest phonon frequencies\nin graphene of 2.51*10^14 rad/s . Interestingly, we obtain a huge thermal\nconductance of 270 MW m-2 K-1 for TiNx/graphene interfaces, which is about 140\n% of the phonon radiation limit. The huge thermal conductance could be\npartially attributed to inelastic phonon transport across the TiNx/graphene\ninterface.

This paper investigates the co-channel deployment of dense\nDSCs, which are mounted on captive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). As the\naltitude of a DSC has a huge impact on the performance of downlink, the\ndownlink interference control problem is mapped to an altitude control problem\nin this paper. All DSCs adjust their altitude to improve the available\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The control problem is modeled\nas a mean-field game (MFG), where the cost function is designed to combine the\navailable SINR with the cost of altitude controling. The interference\nintroduced from a big amount of DSCs is derived through a mean-field\napproximation approach. Within the proposed MFG framework, the related\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations are deduced to\ndescribe and explain the control policy. The optimal altitude control policy is\nobtained by solving the partial differential equations with a proposed finite\ndifference algorithm based on the upwind scheme. The simulations illustrate the\noptimal power controls and corresponding mean field distribution of DSCs. The\nnumerical results also validate that the proposed control policy achieves\nbetter SINR performance of DSCs compared to the uniform control scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 15:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-08"}

It is intended for students learning GR\nor specialist that will find new lights and connexions on these historic\nderivations. Since 1915, it is well known that the observed light bending stems\nfrom two contributions : the first one is directly deduced from the equivalence\nprinciple alone and was obtained by Einstein in 1911; the second one comes from\nthe spatial curvature of spacetime. In GR, those two components are equal, but\nother relativistic theories of gravitation can give different values to those\ncontributions. In this paper, we give a simple explanation, based on the\nwave-particle picture of why the first term, which relies on the equivalence\nprinciple, is identical to the one obtained by a purely Newtonian analysis. In\nthis context of wave analysis, we emphasize that the dependency of the velocity\nof light with the gravitational potential, as deduced by Einstein concerns the\nphase velocity. Then, we wonder whether Einstein could have envisaged already\nin 1911 the second contribution, and therefore the correct result. We argue\nthat considering a length contraction in the radial direction, along with the\ntime dilation implied by the equivalence principle, could have led Einstein to\nthe correct result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 11:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

It can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Gauss-Seidel\nmethod and the Successive Over-Relaxation method for solving linear systems in\nthe literature. Our algorithm is derived from a novel triangle operator\nmapping, which can be computed exactly using a new generalized Gaussian\nelimination procedure. We establish the global convergence, convergence rate,\nand iteration complexity of GMSA for convex problems. In addition, we also\ndiscuss several important extensions of GMSA. Finally, we validate the\nperformance of our proposed method on three particular applications:\nnonnegative matrix factorization, $\\ell_0$ norm regularized sparse coding, and\n$\\ell_1$ norm regularized Dantzig selector problem.

Our approach is based on diffusion embedding vectors and the\nconnection between diffusion maps and signal processing on graphs. As diffusion\nembedding vectors may be expensive to compute for large graphs, we present a\ncomputationally efficient method, based on the Nystr\\\"{o}m extension, for\ninterpolation of signals over a graph. We demonstrate our approach on the MNIST\ndataset and a dataset of daily average temperatures around the US.

Unfortunately this scheme is known to be plagued by various forms of\nnumerical shock instability. In this paper we present various strategies to\nsave the HLLEM scheme from developing such spurious solutions. A linear scale\nanalysis of its mass and interface-normal momentum flux discretizations reveal\nthat its antidiffusive terms, which are primarily responsible for resolution of\nlinear wavefields, are inadvertently activated along a normal shock front due\nto numerical perturbations. These erroneously activated terms counteract the\nfavourable damping mechanism provided by its inherent HLL-type diffusive terms\nand trigger the shock instability. To avoid this, two different strategies are\nproposed for discretization of these critical flux components in the vicinity\nof a shock: one that deals with increasing the magnitude of inherent HLL-type\ndissipation through careful manipulation of specific non-linear wave speed\nestimates while the other deals with reducing the magnitude of these critical\nantidiffusive terms. A linear perturbation analysis is performed to gauge the\neffectiveness of these cures and estimate von-Neumann type stability bounds on\nthe CFL number arising from their use. Results from classic numerical test\ncases show that both types of modified HLLEM schemes are able to provide\nexcellent shock stable solutions while retaining commendable accuracy on shear\ndominated viscous flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 07:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

This probability\ndistribution favors short paths over long ones, with a free parameter (the\ntemperature $T$) controlling the entropic level of the distribution. This\nformalism enables the computation of new distances or dissimilarities,\ninterpolating between the shortest-path and the resistance distance, which have\nbeen shown to perform well in clustering and classification tasks. In this\nwork, the bag-of-paths formalism is extended by adding two independent equality\nconstraints fixing starting and ending nodes distributions of paths (margins).\nWhen the temperature is low, this formalism is shown to be equivalent to a\nrelaxation of the optimal transport problem on a network where paths carry a\nflow between two discrete distributions on nodes. The randomization is achieved\nby considering free energy minimization instead of traditional cost\nminimization. Algorithms computing the optimal free energy solution are\ndeveloped for two types of paths: hitting (or absorbing) paths and non-hitting,\nregular, paths, and require the inversion of an $n \\times n$ matrix with $n$\nbeing the number of nodes. Interestingly, for regular paths on an undirected\ngraph, the resulting optimal policy interpolates between the deterministic\noptimal transport policy ($T \\rightarrow 0^{+}$) and the solution to the\ncorresponding electrical circuit ($T \\rightarrow \\infty$). Two distance\nmeasures between nodes and a dissimilarity between groups of nodes, both\nintegrating weights on nodes, are derived from this framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 14:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 12:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

In this paper, we introduce epidemic models including variable\npopulation size, degree-related imperfect vaccination and quarantine on\nscale-free networks. More specifically, the models are formulated both on the\npopulation with and without permanent natural immunity to infection, which\ncorresponds respectively to the\nsusceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined-recovered (SVIQR) model and the\nsusceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined (SVIQS) model.

For the SVIQR model, we show that the system exhibits a\nforward bifurcation. Meanwhile, the disease-free and unique endemic equilibria\nare shown to be globally asymptotically stable by constructing suitable\nLyapunov functions. For the SVIQS model, conditions ensuring the occurrence of\nmultiple endemic equilibria are derived. Under certain conditions, this system\ncannot undergo a backward bifurcation. The global asymptotical stability of\ndisease-free equilibrium, and the persistence of the disease are proved.

We compare our results with\nthose obtained by Caldarelli et al. for the SIS epidemic model with the\nspectral method applied to adjacency matrices. It turns out that diffusion\ntimes on finite Barabasi-Albert networks are at a minimum. This may be due to a\nlittle-known property of these networks: although the value of the\nassortativity coefficient is close to zero, they look disassortative if one\nconsiders only a bounded range of degrees, including the smallest ones, and\nslightly assortative on the range of the higher degrees. We also find that if\nthe trickle-down character of the diffusion process is enhanced by a larger\ninitial stimulus on the hubs (via a inhomogeneous linear term in the Bass\nmodel), the relative difference between the diffusion times for BA networks and\nuncorrelated networks is even larger, reaching for instance the 34% in a\ntypical case on a network with $10^4$ nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 20:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 17:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

These authors\nworked with several different concepts of the Stieltjes type integral like\nYoung's (Hildebrandt), Kurzweil's (Kurzweil, Schwabik and Tvrd\\'{y}), Dushnik's\n(H\\\"{o}nig) or Lebesgue's (Ashordia, Meng and Zhang).

This active material can be switched between amorphous and\ncrystalline states using electrical/optical pulses. The fundamental mode\npropagating through Silicon waveguide drastically alters its properties due to\nhigh index change at Si-Ge2Sb2Te5 interfaces and absorption in Ge2Sb2Te5. The\noptical switch made of Silicon waveguide with Ge2Sb2Te5 of volume 400 nm x 180\nnm x 450 nm (length x height x width) embedded in to it, provides high\nextinction ratio of 43 dB with low insertion loss of 2.76 dB in ON state at\ncommunication wavelength of 1550 nm. There is trade-off between insertion loss\nand extinction ratio. For 10 dB extinction ratio, The insertion loss can be as\nlow as 1.2 dB and corresponding active volume is also pretty low (100 nm x 150\nnm x 450 nm (length x height x width)). Further, spectral response\ninvestigations reveal that this switch maintains extinction ratio more than 30\ndB in wavelength span 1500-1600 nm. The high static performance of optical\nswitch reported here is a direct result of proper dimensional engineering of\nactive volume as well as its incorporation into the silicon-on-insulator\nwaveguide. We also propose figure-of merit for non volatile optical switches\nthat takes into account relevant parameters of static performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 05:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}
