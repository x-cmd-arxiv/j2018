Simulating a quantum system classically is almost\nimpossible beyond a certain system size whereas a controllable quantum system\ninherently has the resources and computing space to simulate another system.\nAnalog quantum simulation is one of the ways of quantum simulation through\nwhich a known system mimics an unknown system. A key aspect of this is the\nability to generate the target Hamiltonian using control operations which is\nreferred to as Hamiltonian engineering. One way of doing this is to apply pulse\nsequences over a length of time such that the average Hamiltonian over this\nperiod is the desired one. In this thesis, we discuss the method of filtered\nHamiltonian engineering which works in a similar fashion. Using this technique,\nwe create a star topology from a general network of spins.\n  Quantum communication between two parties is an important task for its\napplications in information theory as well as for its use in a quantum\ncomputer. A typical solution to this is using teleportation through the means\nof shared entangled qubits. Teleportation is not ideal for short-range\ncommunication such as between two units in a quantum computer. It has been\nshown that information can be transported from one node of a quantum spin\nnetwork to another by natural evolution of the system over time. Such networks\nare better suited for solid-state based computing architectures as well as for\nshort-range communication. The Hamiltonian that permits such transport however\nplaces stringent requirements on the parameters of the network.

In addition, we develop\nan analytical approximation for the scalar potential and demonstrate how the\nstep-and-peak features of the exact scalar potential are captured by the\nproposed analytical expression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 16:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

In this paper, we develop a new framework for the study of MBEC\nwhich is based on the analysis of the dynamics of microscopic 1D fluctuations\nin the electron and hadron beams during their interaction and propagation\nthrough the system. Within this framework, we derive an analytical formula for\nthe cooling rate and benchmark it against 1D computer simulations with a\nagreement between the analytical and numerical results. We then calculate the\nexpecting cooling time for a set of parameters of the proposed electron-ion\ncollider eRHIC in a simple cooling system with one chicane in the electron\nchannel. While the cooling rate in this system turns out to be insufficient to\ncounteract the intra-beam scattering in the proton beam, we discuss how the\nelectron signal can be amplified by two orders of magnitude through the use of\nplasma effects in the beam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 16:58:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 19:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 17:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

As a consequence, quasi-Majorana states mimic\nmost of the proposed Majorana signatures: quantized zero-bias peaks, the $4\\pi$\nJosephson effect, and the tunneling spectrum in presence of a normal quantum\ndot. We identify a quantized conductance dip instead of a peak in the open\nregime as a distinguishing feature of true Majorana states in addition to\nhaving a bulk topological transition. Because braiding schemes rely only on the\nability to couple to individual Majorana states, the exponential control over\ncoupling strengths allows to also use quasi-Majorana states for braiding.\nTherefore, while the appearance of quasi-Majorana states complicates the\nobservation of topological Majorana states, it opens an alternative route\ntowards braiding of non-Abelian anyons and protected quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 17:24:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 13:35:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 10:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

In this paper we\nprovide the formalism to extract, from the correlation of three signals in the\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), information about the tensor\nthree-point function, which characterizes the non-Gaussian properties of the\nSGWB. This observable can be crucial to discriminate whether a SGWB has a\nprimordial or astrophysical origin. Compared to the two-point function, the\nSGWB three-point function has a richer dependence on the gravitational wave\nmomenta and chiralities. It can be used therefore as a powerful discriminator\nbetween different models. For the first time we provide the response functions\nof LISA to a general SGWB three-point function. As examples, we study in full\ndetail the cases of an equilateral and squeezed SGWB bispectra, and provide the\nexplicit form of the response functions, ready to be convoluted with any\ntheoretical prediction of the bispectrum to obtain the observable signal. We\nfurther derive the optimal estimator to compute the signal-to-noise ratio. Our\nformalism covers general shapes of non-Gaussianity, and can be extended\nstraightaway to other detector geometries. Finally, we provide a short overview\nof models of the early universe that can give rise to a non-Gaussian SGWB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 17:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 13:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 11:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

The contributions of this work are threefold. First of all,\nwe build upon the abstract theory of boundaries and domain walls of topological\nphases of matter to comprehensively catalog the objects realizable in color\ncodes. Together with our classification we also provide lattice representations\nof these objects which include three new types of boundaries as well as a\ngenerating set for all 72 color code twist defects. Our work thus provides an\nexplicit toy model that will help to better understand the abstract theory of\ndomain walls. Secondly, we discover a number of interesting new applications of\nthe cataloged objects for quantum information protocols. These include improved\nmethods for performing quantum computations by code deformation, a new\nfour-qubit error-detecting code, as well as families of new quantum\nerror-correcting codes we call stellated color codes, which encode logical\nqubits at the same distance as the next best color code, but using\napproximately half the number of physical qubits. To the best of our knowledge,\nour new topological codes have the highest encoding rate of local stabilizer\ncodes with bounded-weight stabilizers in two dimensions. Finally, we show how\nthe boundaries and twist defects of the color code are represented by multiple\ncopies of other phases. Indeed, in addition to the well studied comparison\nbetween the color code and two copies of the surface code, we also compare the\ncolor code to two copies of the three-fermion model. In particular, we find\nthat this analogy offers a very clear lens through which we can view the\nsymmetries of the color code which gives rise to its multitude of domain walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 17:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 20:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 17:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

In this paper, we present\nelectron density maps for a sample of outflowing and non-outflowing Seyfert\ngalaxies at z<0.02 drawn from the S7 survey and understand the origin and\nvalues of the observed density structures to reduce the systematic\nuncertainties in outflow energy estimation.

The density within the\noutflowing medium is not uniform and shows both low and high density sites,\nmost likely due to the presence of shocks and highly turbulent medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

We here develop a theory around and experimentally\ndemonstrate a new operation for CDI that uses sinusoidal forcing voltage (or\nsinusoidal current). We use a dynamic system modeling approach, and quantify\nthe frequency response (amplitude and phase) of CDI effluent concentration, and\ndemonstrate that CDI can be modeled as a linear time invariant system. We\nvalidate this model with experiments, and show that a sinusoid voltage\noperation can simultaneously achieve high salt removal and strong energy\nperformance, thus very likely making it superior to other conventional\noperating methods. Based on the underlying coupled phenomena of electrical\ncharge (and ionic) transfer with bulk advection in CDI, we derive and validate\nexperimentally the concept of using sinusoidal voltage forcing functions to\nachieve resonance-type operation for CDI. Despite the complexities of the\nsystem, we find a simple relation for the resonant time scale: the resonant\ntime period is proportional to the geometric mean of the flow residence time\nand the electrical (RC) charging time. Operation at resonance implies the\noptimal balance between absolute amount of salt removed (in moles) and dilution\n(depending on the feed volume processed), thus resulting in the maximum average\nconcentration reduction for the desalinated water. Using a generalized tool\nbased on Fourier analysis, we show that most of the salt removal (~95%) for\nsquare and triangular voltage forcing waveforms is achieved by the fundamental\nFourier (sinusoidal) mode. The frequency of higher Fourier modes precludes high\nflow efficiency for these modes, so these modes consume additional energy for\nminimal additional salt removed. This deficiency of higher frequency modes\nfurther highlights the advantage of DC-offset sinusoidal forcing for CDI\noperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 18:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

However, quasi-static wavefront errors will\nlimit the sensitivity of this endeavor. Additional limitations for ground-based\ntelescopes arise from residual AO-corrected atmospheric wavefront errors,\ngenerating millisecond-lifetime speckles that average into a halo over a long\nexposure. A solution to both of these problems is to use the science camera of\nan ExAO system as a wavefront sensor to perform a fast measurement and\ncorrection method to minimize these aberrations as soon as they are detected.\nWe develop the framework for one such method based on the self-coherent camera\n(SCC) to be applied to ground-based telescopes, called Fast Atmospheric SCC\nTechnique (FAST).

It consists of three components, including a\nstation-level pick-up/drop-off prediction model, station clustering model, and\ncapacitated location-routing optimization model. For the first component, we\npropose a powerful deep learning model called graph convolution neural network\nmodel (GCNN) with data-driven graph filter (DDGF), which can automatically\nlearn the hidden spatial-temporal correlations among stations to provide more\naccurate predictions; for the second component, we apply a graph clustering\nalgorithm labeled the Community Detection algorithm to cluster stations that\nlocate geographically close to each other and have a small net demand gap;\nlast, a capacitated location-routing problem (CLRP) is solved to deal with the\ncombination of two types of decision variables: the locations of bike\ndistribution centers and the design of distribution routes for each cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 20:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

We report a search\nfor spin changes for three large Jupiter-family comets (JFCs): 14P/Wolf,\n143P/Kowal-Mrkos, and 162P/Siding Spring. None of the three comets has\ndetectable period changes, and we set conservative upper limits of 4.2 (14P),\n6.6 (143P) and 25 (162P) minutes per orbit. Comparing these results with all\neight other JFCs with measured rotational changes, we deduce that none of the\nobserved large JFCs experiences significant spin changes. This suggests that\nlarge comet nuclei are less likely to undergo rotationally-driven splitting,\nand therefore more likely to survive more perihelion passages than smaller\nnuclei. We find supporting evidence for this hypothesis in the cumulative size\ndistributions of JFCs and dormant comets, as well as in recent numerical\nstudies of cometary orbital dynamics. We added 143P to the sample of 13 other\nJFCs with known albedos and phase-function slopes. This sample shows a possible\ncorrelation of increasing phase-function slopes for larger geometric albedos.\nPartly based on findings from recent space missions to JFCs, we hypothesise\nthat this correlation corresponds to an evolutionary trend for JFCs.

The\nExoGAN retrievals constitute a significant speed improvement over traditional\nretrievals and can be used either as a final atmospheric analysis or provide\nprior constraints to subsequent retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 21:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 20:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

(2) We fully employ the RNN structure for its parameter\nefficiency and allow deep feature correlation to be propagated along adjacent\nrecurrent states. This new design boosts robustness against inaccurate\ncorrelation estimation due to severely degraded images. (3) We show that it is\nessential to maintain a confined neighborhood for computing deep feature\ncorrelation given degraded images. This is in contrast to existing practice\nthat deploys the whole image. Extensive experiments on both image denoising and\nsuper-resolution tasks are conducted.

Unlike the previous\nworks that only provide estimates at the sample points, our approach directly\nestimates the gradient function, thus allows for a simple and principled\nout-of-sample extension. We provide theoretical results on the error bound of\nthe estimator and discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in practice. The\neffectiveness of our method is demonstrated by applications to gradient-free\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference with implicit distributions.\nFinally, we discuss the intuition behind the estimator by drawing connections\nbetween the Nystr\\\"om method and kernel PCA, which indicates that the estimator\ncan automatically adapt to the geometry of the underlying distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 23:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

The key scope of this work is about visual\nsteganography techniques that hide a full-sized color image / video within\nanother. A majority of existing works are devoted to the image case, where both\nsecret and cover data are images. We empirically validate that image\nsteganography model does not naturally extend to the video case (i.e., hiding a\nvideo into another video), mainly because it completely ignores the temporal\nredundancy within consecutive video frames. Our work proposes a novel solution\nto the problem of video steganography. The technical contributions are\ntwo-fold: first, the residual between two consecutive frames tends to zero at\nmost pixels. Hiding such highly-sparse data is significantly easier than hiding\nthe original frames. Motivated by this fact, we propose to explicitly consider\ninter-frame residuals rather than blindly applying image steganography model on\nevery video frame. Specifically, our model contains two branches, one of which\nis specially designed for hiding inter-frame difference into a cover video\nframe and the other instead hides the original secret frame. A simple\nthresholding method determines which branch a secret video frame shall choose.\nWhen revealing the concealed secret video, two decoders are devised, revealing\ndifference or frame respectively. Second, we develop the model based on deep\nconvolutional neural networks, which is the first of its kind in the literature\nof video steganography. In experiments, comprehensive evaluations are conducted\nto compare our model with both classic least significant bit (LSB) method and\npure image steganography models. All results strongly suggest that the proposed\nmodel enjoys advantages over previous methods. We also carefully investigate\nkey factors in the success of our deep video steganography model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 01:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

It has\nattracted attention in various applications such as 3D tele-presence,\nnavigation for unmanned vehicles and heritage reconstruction. The understanding\nof point clouds, such as point cloud segmentation, is crucial in exploiting the\ninformative value of point clouds for such applications. Due to the\nirregularity of the data format, previous deep learning works often convert\npoint clouds to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images before feeding\nthem into neural networks, which leads to voluminous data and quantization\nartifacts. In this paper, we instead propose a regularized graph convolutional\nneural network (RGCNN) that directly consumes point clouds. Leveraging on\nspectral graph theory, we treat features of points in a point cloud as signals\non graph, and define the convolution over graph by Chebyshev polynomial\napproximation. In particular, we update the graph Laplacian matrix that\ndescribes the connectivity of features in each layer according to the\ncorresponding learned features, which adaptively captures the structure of\ndynamic graphs. Further, we deploy a graph-signal smoothness prior in the loss\nfunction, thus regularizing the learning process. Experimental results on the\nShapeNet part dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity while achieving competitive performance with the state\nof the art. Also, experiments show RGCNN is much more robust to both noise and\npoint cloud density in comparison with other methods. We further apply RGCNN to\npoint cloud classification and achieve competitive results on ModelNet40\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 02:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

To address these difficulties, we introduce an effective proposal\ngeneration method, named Boundary-Sensitive Network (BSN), which adopts \"local\nto global\" fashion.

A possible explanation is\nthe so-called Applegate mechanism, where a strong, variable magnetic field can\nperiodically change the gravitational quadrupole moment of a stellar component,\nthus causing observable period changes. One of the systems exhibiting such\nstrong orbital variations is the RS CVn binary HR 1099, whose activity cycle\nhas been studied by various authors via photospheric and chromospheric activity\nindicators, resulting in contradicting periods. We aim at independently\ndetermining the magnetic activity cycle of HR 1099 using archival X-ray data to\nallow for a comparison to orbital period variations. Archival X-ray data from\n80 different observations of HR 1099 acquired with 12 different X-ray\nfacilities and covering almost four decades were used to determine X-ray fluxes\nin the energy range of 2-10 keV via spectral fitting and flux conversion. Via\nthe Lomb-Scargle periodogram we analyze the resulting long-term X-ray light\ncurve to search for periodicities. We do not detect any statistically\nsignificant periodicities within the X-ray data. An analysis of optical data of\nHR 1099 shows that the derivation of such periods is strongly dependent on the\ntime coverage of available data, since the observed optical variations strongly\ndeviate from a pure sine wave. We argue that this offers an explanation as to\nwhy other authors derive such a wide range of activity cycle periods based on\noptical data. We conclude that our analysis constitutes the longest stellar\nX-ray activity light curve acquired to date, yet the still rather sparse\nsampling of the X-ray data, along with stochastic flaring activity, does not\nallow for the independent determination of an X-ray activity cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 09:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

We have developed a new approach\nto measuring the effective molecular temperature inside a gas absorption cell\nand searching for effects detrimental to a high precision wavelength reference,\nutilizing the Boltzmann distribution of relative line depths within absorption\nbands of single vibrational transitions. With a high resolution Fourier\ntransform spectrometer, we took a series of 632 spectra at temperatures between\n23{\\deg}C and 66{\\deg}C.

The mathematical and\ncomputational difficulties due to the non-differentiable definition of the\nstress tensor in the plug regions, i.e. where the strain-rate tensor vanishes,\nis overcome by using a projection formulation as in the Uzawa-like method for\nviscoplastic flows. This projection definition of the plastic tensor is coupled\nwith a fractional time-stepping scheme designed for Newtonian incompressible\nflows with variable density. The plastic tensor is treated implicitly in the\nfirst sub-step of the fractional time-stepping scheme and a fixed-point\niterative procedure is used for its computation. A pseudo-time relaxation term\nis added into the Bingham projection whose effect is to ensure a geometric\nconvergence of the fixed-point algorithm. This is a key feature of the\nbi-projection scheme which provides a fast and accurate computation of the\nplastic tensor. Stability and error analyses of the bi-projection scheme are\nprovided. The use of the discrete divergence-free velocity to convect the\ndensity in the mass conservation equation allows us to derive lower and upper\nbounds for the discrete density.

The correlation is not very tight and therefore it is necessary to\nexamine it source by source. The objective of the present work is to\ninvestigate in detail the time-lag -- photon-index correlation in GX 339-4. We\nhave obtained RXTE energy spectra and light curves and have computed the photon\nindex and the time lag of the $9 - 15$ keV photons with respect to the $2 - 6$\nkeV ones. The observations cover the first stages of the hard state, the pure\nhard state, and the hard-intermediate state. At low $\\Gamma$, the correlation\nis positive and it becomes negative at large $\\Gamma$. By assuming that the\nhard X-ray power law index $\\Gamma$ is produced by inverse Compton scattering\nof soft disk photons in the jet, we have reproduced the entire correlation by\nvarying two parameters in the jet: the radius of the jet at its base $R_0$ and\nthe Thomson optical depth along the jet $\\tau_\\parallel$. We have found that,\nas the luminosity of the source increases, $R_0$ initially increases and then\ndecreases. This behavior is expected in the context of the Cosmic Battery. As a\nfurther test of our model, we predict the break frequency in the radio spectrum\nas a function of the photon index during the rising part of an outburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 09:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

We aim to trace the\nabundance patterns and the time-evolution of five s-process elements in the\nfirst peak, Y and Zr, and in the second peak, Ba, La and Ce using the Gaia-ESO\nidr5 results. From the UVES spectra of cluster member stars, we determined the\naverage composition of clusters with ages >0.1 Gyr. We derived statistical ages\nand distances of field stars, and we separated them in thin and thick disc\npopulations. We studied the time evolution and dependence on metallicity of\nabundance ratios using open clusters and field stars. Using our large and\nhomogeneous sample of open clusters, thin and thick disc stars, spanning an age\nrange larger than 10 Gyr, we confirm an increase towards young ages of\ns-process abundances in the Solar neighbourhood. These trends are well defined\nfor open clusters and stars located nearby the solar position and they may be\nexplained by a late enrichment due to significant contribution to the\nproduction of these elements from long-living low-mass stars. At the same time,\nwe found a strong dependence of the s-process abundance ratios with the\nGalactocentric distance and with the metallicity of the clusters and field\nstars. Our results, derived from the largest and homogeneous sample of\ns-process abundances in the literature, confirm the growth with decreasing\nstellar ages of the s-process abundances in both field and open cluster stars.\nAt the same time, taking advantage of the abundances of open clusters located\nin a wide Galactocentric range, they open a new view on the dependence of the\ns-process evolution on the metallicity and star formation history, pointing to\ndifferent behaviours at various Galactocentric distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 10:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Each\ntime a call is made (or an SMS sent), a Call Detail Record (CDR) is generated\nby the telecom companies for billing purpose. These metadata provide\ninformation on when, how, from where and with whom we communicate.\nConceptually, they can be described as a geospatial, dynamic, weighted and\ndirected network. Applications of CDRs for development are numerous. They have\nbeen used to model the spread of infectious diseases, study road traffic,\nsupport electrification planning strategies or map socio-economic level of\npopulation. While massive, CDRs are not statistically representative of the\nwhole population due to several sources of bias (market, usage, spatial and\ntemporal resolution). Furthermore, mobile phone metadata are held by telecom\ncompanies. Consequently, their access is not necessarily straightforward and\ncan seriously hamper any operational application. Finally, a trade-off exists\nbetween privacy and utility when using sensitive data like CDRs. New\ninitiatives such as Open Algorithm might help to deal with these fundamental\nquestions by allowing researchers to run algorithms on the data that remain\nsafely stored behind the firewall of the providers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 11:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

The present work\nraises the question regarding the computational efficiency of compressible DG\nsolvers as compared to a genuinely incompressible formulation. Our\ncontributions to the state-of-the-art are twofold: Firstly, we present a\nhigh-performance discontinuous Galerkin solver for the compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations based on a highly efficient matrix-free implementation\nthat targets modern cache-based multicore architectures. The performance\nresults presented in this work focus on the node-level performance and our\nresults suggest that there is great potential for further performance\nimprovements for current state-of-the-art discontinuous Galerkin\nimplementations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.

On the basis of a minimal cellular automaton and a\ncontinuous agent-based model for pedestrian evacuation dynamics, we find that\nthe inclusion of polite pedestrians amid a given competitive crowd fails to\nreduce the evacuation time when the constriction (the doorway) is acceptably\nlarge.

We adopt a different stance by relying on a latent model where\nwe directly model counts by means of Poisson distributions that are conditional\nto latent (hidden) Gaussian correlated variables. In this multivariate Poisson\nlognormal-model, the dependency structure is completely captured by the latent\nlayer. This parametric model enables to account for the effects of covariates\non the counts.\n  To perform network inference, we add a sparsity inducing constraint on the\ninverse covariance matrix of the latent Gaussian vector. Unlike the usual\nGaussian setting, the penalized likelihood is generally not tractable, and we\nresort instead to a variational approach for approximate likelihood\nmaximization. The corresponding optimization problem is solved by alternating a\ngradient ascent on the variational parameters and a graphical-Lasso step on the\ncovariance matrix.\n  We show that our approach is highly competitive with the existing methods on\nsimulation inspired from microbiological data.

Specifically, we first study the resource-efficient computation\noffloading problem for a user, in order to reduce user's resource occupation by\ndetermining its optimal communication and computation resource profile with\nminimum resource occupation and meanwhile satisfying the QoS constraint. We\nthen tackle the critical problem of user admission control for JCC resource\nallocation, in order to properly select the set of users for resource demand\nsatisfaction.

To prevent the manipulation that some users may untruthfully report\ntheir valuations in acquiring mobile-edge cloud service, we further resort to\nthe powerful tool of critical value approach to design truthful pricing scheme\nfor JCC resource allocation.

To solve this problem, neural\nnetworks started to be employed to learn word vectors, such as the word2vec.\nWord2vec embeds word semantic structure into vectors, where the angle between\nvectors indicates the meaningful similarity between words. To measure the\nsimilarity between texts, we propose the novel concept of word subspace, which\ncan represent the intrinsic variability of features in a set of word vectors.\nThrough this concept, it is possible to model text from word vectors while\nholding semantic information. To incorporate the word frequency directly in the\nsubspace model, we further extend the word subspace to the term-frequency (TF)\nweighted word subspace.

We find the symmetry transformations\ncorresponding to the similarity transformation of the energy-momentum tensor,\nand find that their generators are T-dual. Particularly, we find that the\ngeneral coordinate and local gauge transformations are T-dual, so we conclude\nthat T-duality in addition to the well known exchanges, transforms symmetries\nof the initial and its T-dual theory into each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 13:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Experimental observations, however,\nshow that this assumption is often far from the real cell cycle time\ndistribution (CCTD). Recent studies have suggested an alternative approach to\nmodelling cell proliferation based on a multi-stage representation of the CCTD.\nIn order to validate and parametrise these models, it is important to connect\nthem to experimentally measurable quantities. In this paper we investigate the\nconnection between the CCTD and the speed of the collective invasion. We first\nstate a result for a general CCTD, which allows the computation of the invasion\nspeed using the Laplace transform of the CCTD. We use this to deduce the range\nof speeds for the general case. We then focus on the more realistic case of\nmulti-stage models, using both a stochastic agent-based model and a set of\nreaction-diffusion equations for the cells' average density. By studying the\ncorresponding travelling wave solutions, we obtain an analytical expression for\nthe speed of invasion for a general N-stage model with identical transition\nrates, in which case the resulting cell cycle times are Erlang distributed. We\nshow that, for a general N-stage model, the Erlang distribution and the\nexponential distribution lead to the minimum and maximum invasion speed,\nrespectively. This result allows us to determine the range of possible invasion\nspeeds in terms of the average proliferation time for any multi-stage model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 13:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

However, the exact mechanisms\ndriving multiferroic behavior are not well understood in most materials. Two\nsuch materials are the spinels MnV2O4 and Mn3O4, where mechanical strain is\nthought to play a role in determining magnetic behavior. Bulk studies of MnV2O4\nhave yielded conflicting and inconclusive results, due in part to the presence\nof mesoscale magnetic inhomogeneity, which complicates the interpretation of\nbulk measurements. To study the sub-micron-scale magnetic properties of\nMn-based spinel materials, we performed magnetic force microscopy (MFM) on\nMnV2O4 samples subject to different levels of mechanical strain. We also used a\ncrystal grain mapping technique to perform spatially registered MFM on Mn3O4.\nThese local investigations revealed 100-nm-scale \"stripe\" modulations in the\nmagnetic structure of both materials. In MnV2O4, the magnetization of these\nstripes is estimated to be Mz $\\approx$ 105 A/m, which is on the order of the\nsaturation magnetization reported previously. Cooling in a strong magnetic\nfield eliminated the stripe patterning only in the low-strain sample of MnV2O4.\nThe discovery of nanoscale magnetostructural inhomogeneity that is highly\nsusceptible to magnetic field control in these materials necessitates both a\nrevision of theoretical proposals and a reinterpretation of experimental data\nregarding the low-temperature phases and magnetic-field-tunable properties of\nthese Mn-based spinels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 13:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

For massive IoT data acquisition, a\ngateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/\nactuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing\nfunctionality. In this perspective , gateways acting as producers need to\nallocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is\nproposed a Publish/-Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework\n(PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources\nbetween aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules\nIoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally , the\nframework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled\nbackbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users\nand consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation\nModel (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT\ndata streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub\narchitecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework\ncomponents. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of\nan ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating\nresources efficiently keeping QoS awareness and handling restricted network\nresources (bandwidth) for massive IoT traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 13:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-18"}

The increase in sensitivity of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov\nTelescopes (IACTs) has lead to numerous detections of extended $\\gamma$-ray\nsources at TeV energies, sometimes of sizes comparable to the instrument's\nfield of view (FoV). This creates a demand for advanced and flexible data\nanalysis methods, able to extract source information by utilising the photon\ncounts in the entire FoV.\n  Aims. We present a new software package, \"SkyPrism\", aimed at performing 2D\n(3D if energy is considered) fits of IACT data, possibly containing multiple\nand extended sources, based on sky images binned in energy. Though the\ndevelopment of this package was focused on the analysis of data collected with\nthe MAGIC telescopes, it can further be adapted to other instruments, such as\nthe future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).\n  Methods. We have developed a set of tools that, apart from sky images (count\nmaps), compute the instrument response functions (IRFs) of MAGIC (effective\nexposure throughout the FoV, point spread function (PSF), energy resolution and\nbackground shape), based on the input data, Monte-Carlo simulations and the\npointing track of the telescopes. With this information, the presented package\ncan perform a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit of source models of arbitrary\nmorphology to the sky images providing energy spectra, detection significances,\nand upper limits.\n  Results. We demonstrate that the SkyPrism tool accurately reconstructs the\nMAGIC PSF, on and off-axis performance as well as the underlying background.

Here, the Sandia D and E\nturbulent partially-premixed flames are computed using large eddy simulation\n(LES) with a flamelet/progress variable approach. Using 300 simultaneous LES\ncomputations of each flame, the partial Lyapunov spectrum of the flow is\nobtained, which provides a set of Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and Lyapunov vectors\n(LVs). Special numerical procedures to handle such large data sets and perform\nmatrix manipulations on-the-fly are discussed. From the LEs, the dimension of\nthe attractor for the flames was estimated, for the first time, to be at least\n5000 (flame D) and 10500 (flame E). This is a significant result indicating\nthat the chaoticity of the turbulent flame is confined to a volume of\nphase-space that is quantified. The growth of perturbations occurs at\ntime-scales that are much larger than the smallest strain-rate based times\nscales, but smaller than the integral scales. Further, the Lya- punov vectors\nthat determine the perturbation response show that the strongest perturbations\nare aligned with the jet breakdown region, while other LVs are aligned with the\nshear layer. It is found that both the extinction/re-ignition process and the\nturbulence-induced jet motion strongly contribute to the flame chaoticity but\nare not equally important for all the LVs.

Due to high sampling\nrates for audio, employing a long temporal input context on the sample level is\ndifficult, but required for high quality separation results because of\nlong-range temporal correlations.

Using the concepts of classical nucleation theory, we show that the\ncritical radius of a void formed in amorphous graphene at constant pressure is\nsimply the ratio of line tension at the void and the applied pressure. The\nvalues of the critical radius of the void for flat and buckled graphene are\n3.48\\AA ~and 3.31\\AA, respectively at 2 eV/\\AA${^2}$ pressure.

One\nalgorithm employs a pivoted Cholesky decomposition of the Gram matrix\nconstructed from the terms of the mixture to select what we call skeleton terms\nand the other uses orthogonalization for the same purpose. Importantly, the\nmultivariate mixtures do not have to be a separated representation of a\nfunction. Both algorithms require $O(r^2 N + p(d) r N) $ operations, where $N$\nis the initial number of terms in the multivariate mixture, $r$ is the number\nof selected linearly independent terms, and $p(d)$ is the cost of computing the\ninner product between two terms of a mixture in $d$ variables. For general\nGaussian mixtures $p(d) \\sim d^3$ since we need to diagonalize a $d\\times d$\nmatrix, whereas for separated representations $p(d) \\sim d$. Due to\nconditioning issues, the resulting accuracy is limited to about one half of the\navailable significant digits for both algorithms.

This paper shows that the least-squares (LS) inversion of the model is\nnot strictly convex due to its saddle point structure. It is demonstrated that\nthe widely used unconstrained damped least-squares (DLS) inversion of the model\ncould lead to biased and physically unrealistic retrievals---chiefly because of\nthe existing preferential solution spaces that are characterized by the\neigenspace of the model Hessian.

In this paper, by\ntaking the entropy associated with the apparent horizon of the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe in the form of Tsallis entropy, and\nassuming the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_hdS_h+WdV$, holds on the\napparent horizon, we are able to derive the corresponding Friedmann equations\ndescribing the dynamics of the universe with any spatial curvature.

One of the biggest challenges for\nsentiment analysis is that it is highly language dependent. Word embeddings,\nsentiment lexicons, and even annotated data are language specific. Further,\noptimizing models for each language is very time consuming and labor intensive\nespecially for recurrent neural network models. From a resource perspective, it\nis very challenging to collect data for different languages.\n  In this paper, we look for an answer to the following research question: can\na sentiment analysis model trained on a language be reused for sentiment\nanalysis in other languages, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Dutch, where the\ndata is more limited? Our goal is to build a single model in the language with\nthe largest dataset available for the task, and reuse it for languages that\nhave limited resources. For this purpose, we train a sentiment analysis model\nusing recurrent neural networks with reviews in English.

The applicability of the multiplicative\napproach to the simulation of viscoelastic properties of a composite material\nis assessed, certain improvements are suggested. For a greater accuracy in\napplications involving local compressive fiber buckling, a new family of\nhyperelastic potentials is introduced. This family allows us to account for the\nvariable critical compressive stress, which depends on the fiber-matrix\ninteraction. For the simulation of viscoelasticity, the well-established\nSidoroff decomposition of the deformation gradient is implemented. To account\nfor the viscosity of the matrix material, the model of Simo and Miehe (1992) is\nused; highly efficient iteration-free algorithms are implemented. The viscosity\nof the fiber is likewise described by the multiplicative decomposition of the\ndeformation gradient, leading to a scalar differential equation; an efficient\niteration-free algorithm is proposed for the implicit time stepping. The\naccuracy and convergence of the new iteration-free method is tested and\ncompared to that of the standard scheme implementing the Newton iteration. To\ndemonstrate the applicability of the approach, a pressurized multi-layer\ncomposite pipe is modelled; the so-called stretch inversion phenomenon is\nreproduced and explained. The stress distribution is obtained by a\nsemi-analytical procedure; it may serve as a benchmark for FEM computations.\nFinally, the issue of the parameter identification is addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2018 19:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}
