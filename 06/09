In this setting, mixing is a purely\nadvective effect which causes a transfer of energy to high frequencies. When\ndiffusion is present, mixing enhances the dissipative forces. This phenomenon\nis referred to as enhanced dissipation, namely the identification of a\ntime-scale faster than the purely diffusive one. We establish a precise\nconnection between quantitative mixing rates in terms of decay of negative\nSobolev norms and enhanced dissipation time-scales. The proofs are based on a\ncontradiction argument that takes advantage of the cascading mechanism due to\nmixing, an estimate of the distance between the inviscid and viscous dynamics,\nand of an optimization step in the frequency cut-off.\n  Thanks to the generality and robustness of our approach, we are able to apply\nour abstract results to a number of problems. For instance, we prove that\ncontact Anosov flows obey logarithmically fast dissipation time-scales. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first example of a flow that induces an\nenhanced dissipation time-scale faster than polynomial. Other applications\ninclude passive scalar evolution in both planar and radial settings and\nfractional diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 16:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

In this paper\nwe describe Badger - a new hybrid approach for complexity analysis, with the\ngoal of discovering vulnerabilities which occur when the worst-case time or\nspace complexity of an application is significantly higher than the average\ncase. Badger uses fuzz testing to generate a diverse set of inputs that aim to\nincrease not only coverage but also a resource-related cost associated with\neach path. Since fuzzing may fail to execute deep program paths due to its\nlimited knowledge about the conditions that influence these paths, we\ncomplement the analysis with a symbolic execution, which is also customized to\nsearch for paths that increase the resource-related cost. Symbolic execution is\nparticularly good at generating inputs that satisfy various program conditions\nbut by itself suffers from path explosion. Therefore, Badger uses fuzzing and\nsymbolic execution in tandem, to leverage their benefits and overcome their\nweaknesses. We implemented our approach for the analysis of Java programs,\nbased on Kelinci and Symbolic PathFinder. We evaluated Badger on Java\napplications, showing that our approach is significantly faster in generating\nworst-case executions compared to fuzzing or symbolic execution on their own.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 17:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

The model then correctly predicts the observed UV LF at\n$z=5-10$. We present predictions for the UV luminosity and stellar mass\nfunctions, \\textit{JWST} number counts, and SFHs. In particular, we find a\nstellar-to-halo mass relation at $z=4-10$ that scales with halo mass at $M_{\\rm\nh}<10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$ as $M_{\\star}\\propto M_{\\rm h}^2$, with a normalization\nthat is higher than the relation inferred at $z=0$. The average SFRs increase\nas a function of time to $z=4$, although there is significant scatter around\nthe average: about 6\\% of the $z=4$ galaxies show no significant mass growth.\nUsing these SFHs, we present redshift-dependent UV-to-SFR conversion factors,\nmass return fractions, and mass-to-light ratios for different intial mass\nfunctions and metallicities, finding that current estimates of the cosmic SFR\ndensity at $z\\sim10$ may be overestimated by $\\sim0.1-0.2~\\mathrm{dex}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 21:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

From a theoretical point of view,\nestablishing the existence of those states requires the analysis of the\n`convexity' of the EoS. We show indications of the existence of regions in the\ndense-matter EoS where the thermodynamics may be non-convex as a result of a\nnon-monotonic dependence of the sound speed with the rest-mass density. When\nthis happens, non-conventional dynamics may develop.

A common paradigm for\nstudying source memory is the `three-list' experimental paradigm, where a\nsubject studies three lists of words and is later asked whether a given word\nappeared on one or more of the studied lists. Surprisingly, the sum total of\nthe acceptance probabilities generated by asking for the source of a word\nseparately for each list (`list 1?', `list 2?', `list 3?') exceeds the\nacceptance probability generated by asking whether that word occurred on the\nunion of the lists (`list 1 or 2 or 3?'). The episodic memory for a given word\ntherefore appears over distributed on the disjoint contexts of the lists. A\nquantum episodic memory model [QEM] was proposed by Brainerd, Wang and Reyna\n(2013) to explain this type of result. In this paper, we apply a Hamiltonian\ndynamical extension of QEM for over distribution of source memory. The\nHamiltonian operators are simultaneously driven by parameters for re-allocation\nof gist-based and verbatim-based acceptance support as subjects are exposed to\nthe cue word in the first temporal stage, and are attenuated for\ndescription-dependence by the querying probe in the second temporal stage.\nOverall, the model predicts well the choice proportions in both separate list\nand union list queries and the over distribution effect, suggesting that a\nHamiltonian dynamics for QEM can provide a good account of the acceptance\nprocesses involved in episodic memory tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 19:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 03:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-24"}

Time resolved\nschlieren videos recorded at approximately 100 kHz and numerical reconstruction\nof the flow field permitted to determine the mechanism of flame acceleration\nand transition to detonation.

The acceleration through this regime resulted in the strengthening of\nthis shock.

Our work is motivated by\nnovel applications from the domain of process automation, Machine-Type\nCommunication (MTC) and cyber-physical systems, where short messages are\ncommunicated and statistical guarantees need to be provided on a per-message\nlevel. In order to optimize such a network, apart from understanding the\nstationary system dynamics, an understanding of the short-term dynamics (i.e.,\ntransient behavior) is also required. To this end, we derive novel Wireless\nTransient Bounds (WTB) for end-to-end delay and backlog in a multi-hop wireless\nnetwork using stochastic network calculus approach. WTB depends on the initial\nbacklog at each node as well as the instantaneous channel states. We\nnumerically compare WTB with State-Of-The-Art Transient bounds (SOTAT), that\ncan be obtained by adapting existing stationary bounds, as well as simulation\nof the network. While SOTAT and stationary bounds are not able to capture the\nshort-term system dynamics well, WTB provides relatively tight upper bound and\nhas a decay rate that closely matches the simulation. This is achieved by WTB\nonly with a slight increase in the computational complexity, by a factor of O(T\n+ N), where T is the duration of the arriving sequence and N is the number of\nhops in the network.

We show that this Ansatz reproduces the known\nperturbative corrections at weak heterotic coupling, including tree-level, one-\nand two-loop corrections, plus non-perturbative effects of order\n$e^{-1/g_3^2}$. We also examine the weak coupling expansions in type I and type\nII string duals and find agreement with known perturbative results, as well as\nnew predictions for higher genus perturbative contributions. In the limit where\na circle in the internal torus decompactifies, our Ansatz predicts the exact\n$\\nabla^2 F^4$ effective interaction in four-dimensional CHL string vacua,\nalong with infinite series of exponentially suppressed corrections of order\n$e^{-R}$ from Euclideanized BPS black holes winding around the circle, and\nfurther suppressed corrections of order $e^{-R^2}$ from Taub-NUT instantons. We\nshow that instanton corrections from 1/4-BPS black holes are precisely weighted\nby the BPS index predicted from the DVV formula, including the detailed moduli\ndependence. We also extract two-instanton corrections from pairs of 1/2-BPS\nblack holes, demonstrating consistency with supersymmetry and wall-crossing,\nand estimate the size of instanton-anti-instanton contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 19:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 21:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Knowledge of\nego-motion and depth perception enables the agent to effectively associate\nmultiple object proposals, which serve as training data for learning object\nrepresentations from unlabelled images. We demonstrate the utility of this\nrepresentation in two ways. First, we can automatically discover objects by\nperforming clustering in the learned embedding space. Each resulting cluster\ncontains examples of one instance seen from various viewpoints and scales.\nSecond, given a small number of labeled images, we can efficiently learn\ndetectors for these labels. In the few-shot regime, these detectors have a\nsubstantially higher mAP of 0.22 compared to 0.12 of off-the-shelf standard\ndetectors trained on this limited data. Thus, the proposed self-supervision\nresults in effective environment specific object discovery and detection at no\nor very small human labeling cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 22:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

We find, however, that\nthe magnitude of the observed intensity deficit in the Sun's shadow is\nsignificantly less than that predicted by MC simulations, particularly during\nthe period around solar maximum when a significant number of ECMEs is recorded.\nThe $\\chi^2$ tests of the agreement between the observations and the MC\nsimulations show that the difference is larger during the periods when the\nECMEs occur, and the difference is reduced if the periods of ECMEs are excluded\nfrom the analysis. This suggests the first experimental evidence of the ECMEs\naffecting the Sun's shadow observed in the 3~TeV cosmic-ray intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 00:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

Robots that can perform targeted weed control offer\nthe potential to contribute to this goal, for example, through specialized\nweeding actions such as selective spraying or mechanical weed removal. A\nprerequisite of such systems is a reliable and robust plant classification\nsystem that is able to distinguish crop and weed in the field. A major\nchallenge in this context is the fact that different fields show a large\nvariability. Thus, classification systems have to robustly cope with\nsubstantial environmental changes with respect to weed pressure and weed types,\ngrowth stages of the crop, visual appearance, and soil conditions.

It has been the dominant approach to constructing\nembedded classification schemes since it outputs dendrograms, which capture the\nhierarchical relationship among members at all levels of granularity,\nsimultaneously. Being greedy in the algorithmic sense, a hierarchical\nclustering partitions data at every step solely based on a similarity /\ndissimilarity measure. The clustering results oftentimes depend on not only the\ndistribution of the underlying data, but also the choice of dissimilarity\nmeasure and the clustering algorithm. In this paper, we propose a method to\nincorporate prior domain knowledge about entity relationship into the\nhierarchical clustering. Specifically, we use a distance function in\nultrametric space to encode the external ontological information. We show that\npopular linkage-based algorithms can faithfully recover the encoded structure.\nSimilar to some regularized machine learning techniques, we add this distance\nas a penalty term to the original pairwise distance to regulate the final\nstructure of the dendrogram. As a case study, we applied this method on real\ndata in the building of a customer behavior based product taxonomy for an\nAmazon service, leveraging the information from a larger Amazon-wide browse\nstructure. The method is useful when one wants to leverage the relational\ninformation from external sources, or the data used to generate the distance\nmatrix is noisy and sparse.

In such applications, different types of errors (false positive\nor false negative) usaully have unequal costs. And the error costs, which\ndepend on specific applications, are usually unknown. However, current\nabstaining classification methods either do not distinguish the error types, or\nthey need the cost information of misclassification and rejection, which are\nrealized in the framework of cost-sensitive learning. In this paper, we propose\na bounded-abstention method with two constraints of reject rates (BA2), which\nperforms abstaining classification when error costs are unequal and unknown.\nBA2 aims to obtain the optimal area under the ROC curve (AUC) by constraining\nthe reject rates of the positive and negative classes respectively.\nSpecifically, we construct the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,\nand stepwise search the optimal reject thresholds from both ends of the curve,\nuntill the two constraints are satisfied. Experimental results show that BA2\nobtains higher AUC and lower total cost than the state-of-the-art abstaining\nclassification methods. Meanwhile, BA2 achieves controllable reject rates of\nthe positive and negative classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 09:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 03:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

Experiment results show that\nby virtue of the significant noise reduction in the region, our DIR-ST$^2$\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art approach employing one-class support\nvector machine in terms of the $\\mathcal{F}_1$ score from comparison with\nprecisely-defined regions regarded as a ground truth, and returns apparently\nbetter delineation of imprecise regions. The computational complexity of\nDIR-ST$^2$ is also analytically and numerically shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 14:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

The effect of CVD process variables such\nas temperature, choice of catalyst, etc on the growth behavior of nanotubes has\nbeen examined to understand the catalytic growth of CNTs. The transition metal\ncatalysts, Fe and Ni, were used in both elemental metal form and in a metal\ncomplex form. In the case of elemental metal catalysts, the respective metals\nwere deposited over the Si substrate using thermal evaporation following which\nnanotubes were synthesized by means of CVD. Subsequent studies of the\nsynthesized carbon nanostructures employing elemental metal catalysts revealed\na significant influence of the temperature and the catalyst material on the\nstructure of CNTs. The CNTs synthesized using Ni catalyst were bamboo-like\nwhereas the CNTs developed employing Fe catalyst were straight tubes with\npartial metal filling. Consequently, growth models for the different growth\nmechanisms have been proposed. Certain limitations of the above process have\nbeen overcome by employing spin-coating of a metal complex catalyst material on\nthe Si substrate. The CVD synthesis of nanotubes using metal complex catalysts\nalways resulted in partially catalyst filled CNTs. More importantly, the metal\ncomplex catalyst could be easily patterned on the Si substrate using\nspin-coating and photolithography, which resulted in site selective growth of\npartially catalyst filled MWCNTs.
