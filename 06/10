When a client access a\nmalicious server, the data field of that server response might be different\nthan the value it originally stored. However, all other control variables in\nthe server reply and protocol actions are according to the server algorithm.\nFor the coded atomic storage (CAS) algorithms by Cadambe et al., we present an\nenhancement that ensures no information leakage and malicious fault-tolerance.\n  We also consider recovery after the occurrence of transient faults that\nviolate the assumptions according to which the system is to behave. After their\nlast occurrence, transient faults leave the system in an arbitrary state (while\nthe program code stays intact). We present a self-stabilizing algorithm, which\nrecovers after the occurrence of transient faults. This addition to Cadambe et\nal. considers asynchronous settings as long as no transient faults occur. The\nrecovery from transient faults that bring the system counters (close) to their\nmaximal values may include the use of a global reset procedure, which requires\nthe system run to be controlled by a fair scheduler. After the recovery period,\nthe safety properties are provided for asynchronous system runs that are not\nnecessarily controlled by fair schedulers.\n  Since the recovery period is bounded and the occurrence of transient faults\nis extremely rare, we call this design criteria self-stabilization in the\npresence of seldom fairness.

Low-rank matrices have\nalso received considerable attention recently in the context of optimization\nalgorithms with partial observations, and nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has\nbeen widely used as a popular heuristic of rank minimization for low-rank\nmatrix recovery problems. On the other hand, it has been shown that NNM can be\nviewed as a special case of atomic norm minimization (ANM), which has achieved\ngreat success in solving line spectrum estimation problems. However, as far as\nwe know, the general ANM (not NNM) considered in many existing works can only\nhandle frequency estimation in undamped sinusoids. In this work, we aim to fill\nthis gap and deal with damped spectrally sparse signal recovery problems. In\nparticular, inspired by the dual analysis used in ANM, we offer a novel\noptimization-based perspective on the classical MUSIC algorithm and propose an\nalgorithm for spectral estimation that involves searching for the peaks of the\ndual polynomial corresponding to a certain NNM problem, and we show that this\nalgorithm is in fact equivalent to MUSIC itself. Building on this connection,\nwe also extend the classical MUSIC algorithm to the missing data case. We\nprovide exact recovery guarantees for our proposed algorithms and quantify how\nthe sample complexity depends on the true spectral parameters. In particular,\nwe provide a parameter-specific recovery bound for low-rank matrix recovery of\njointly sparse signals rather than use certain incoherence properties as in\nexisting literature. Simulation results also indicate that the proposed\nalgorithms significantly outperform some relevant existing methods (e.g., ANM)\nin frequency estimation of damped exponentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 17:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 20:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 22:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 18:55:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 15:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

The data involved in CTR prediction are typically multi-field\ncategorical data, i.e., every feature is categorical and belongs to one and\nonly one field. One of the interesting characteristics of such data is that\nfeatures from one field often interact differently with features from different\nother fields. Recently, Field-aware Factorization Machines (FFMs) have been\namong the best performing models for CTR prediction by explicitly modeling such\ndifference. However, the number of parameters in FFMs is in the order of\nfeature number times field number, which is unacceptable in the real-world\nproduction systems. In this paper, we propose Field-weighted Factorization\nMachines (FwFMs) to model the different feature interactions between different\nfields in a much more memory-efficient way. Our experimental evaluations show\nthat FwFMs can achieve competitive prediction performance with only as few as\n4% parameters of FFMs. When using the same number of parameters, FwFMs can\nbring 0.92% and 0.47% AUC lift over FFMs on two real CTR prediction data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 17:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 23:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

Current datasets demonstrate a clear lack of\nreal-network threats, attack representation and include a large number of\ndeprecated threats, which together limit the detection accuracy of current\nmachine learning IDS approaches. The unique combination of the taxonomy and the\nanalysis of the datasets provided in this manuscript aims to improve the\ncreation of datasets and the collection of real-world data.

I show that entanglement (e.g., with the environment)\ncan yield a time-independent equilibrium in an individual quantum system. This\nallows one to eliminate ensembles -- an awkward stratagem introduced to\nreconcile thermodynamics with Newtonian mechanics -- and use an individual\nsystem interacting and therefore entangled with its heat bath to represent\nequilibrium and to elucidate the role of information and measurements in\nphysics. Thus, in our quantum Universe one can practice statistical physics\nwithout ensembles -- hence, in a sense, without statistics. The elimination of\nensembles uses ideas that led to the recent derivation of Born's rule from the\nsymmetries of entanglement, and I start with a review of that derivation. I\nthen review and discuss difficulties related to the reliance on ensembles and\nillustrate the need for ensembles with the classical Szilard's engine. A\nsimilar quantum engine -- a single system interacting with the thermal heat\nbath environment -- is enough to establish thermodynamics. The role of\nMaxwell's demon (which in this quantum context resembles Wigner's friend) is\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 19:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

OCCAM infers the internal topology of a communication\nnetwork, including the internal nodes and links of the network that are not\namenable to direct measurement. In addition to network topology, OCCAM infers\nthe routing paths that packets take between the hosts. OCCAM uses path metrics\nmeasurable from the hosts and expresses the observed measurements as\nconstraints of a mixed-integer bilinear optimization problem that can then be\nfeasibly solved to yield the network topology and the routing paths.

Our aim in this paper is to improve on\nthe state of the art patch matching techniques by observing the fact that a\nsparse-overcomplete representation of an image posses statistical properties of\nnatural visual scenes which can be exploited for patch matching. We propose a\nnew paradigm which encodes image patch details by encoding the patch and\nsubsequently using this sparse representation as input to a neural network to\ncompare the patches. As sparse coding is based on a generative model of natural\nimage patches, it can represent the patch in terms of the fundamental visual\ncomponents from which it has been composed of, leading to similar sparse codes\nfor patches which are built from similar components. Once the sparse coded\nfeatures are extracted, we employ a fully-connected neural network, which\ncaptures the non-linear relationships between features, for comparison.

In contrast to\nexisting approaches, which typically penalize large discrepancies, our approach\nallows for significant displacements, with the aim to accommodate large\ndeformations of the objects in scene. Localizing the search space by\nsemantically matching object-level correspondence, our method robustly handles\nlarge deformations of objects. Representing the target region by concatenated\nhypercolumn features which take into account the hierarchical levels of the\nsurrounding context, helps to clear the ambiguity to further improve the\naccuracy. By conducting multiple experiments across scenes with non-rigid\nobjects, we validate the proposed approach, and show that it outperforms the\nstate of the art methods for semantic correspondence establishment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 00:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

QPPs are usually detected as spatial displacements of coronal loops\nin imaging observations or as periodic shifts of line properties in\nspectroscopic observations.

We combine imaging and\nspectroscopic measurements of available space missions, and investigate the\nproperties of non-damping oscillations at flaring loops. Methods. We used the\nIRIS to measure the spectrum over a narrow slit. The double-component Gaussian\nfitting method was used to extract the line profile of Fe XXI 1354.08 A at \"O\nI\" window. The quasi-periodicity of loop oscillations were identified in the\nFourier and wavelet spectra. Results. A periodicity at about 40 s is detected\nin the line properties of Fe XXI, HXR emissions in GOES 1-8 A derivative, and\nFermi 26-50 keV. The Doppler velocity and line width oscillate in phase, while\na phase shift of about Pi/2 is detected between the Doppler velocity and peak\nintensity. The amplitudes of Doppler velocity and line width oscillation are\nabout 2.2 km/s and 1.9 km/s, respectively, while peak intensity oscillate with\namplitude at about 3.6% of the background emission.

We aim to\nconstrain radial differential rotation profiles in gamma Doradus (gamma Dor)\nstars, and to develop new theoretical seismic diagnosis for such stars with\nrapid and potentially non-uniform rotation. Methods. We derive a new asymptotic\ndescription which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core\nrotation on gravity- mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are\nillustrated from pulsation computations with the code GYRE and compared with\nobservations of gamma Dor stars. When possible, we also derive the surface\nrotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of\nrotational modulation, and compute the core-to-surface rotation ratios.\nResults. Stellar rotation has to be strongly differential before its effects on\nperiod spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing\npatterns can be compared.

Once we have the\nstrong comparison principle, we can prove a weak comparison principle for\nsemicontinuous viscosity solutions of the prescribed mean curvature equation in\na bounded domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 05:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

However, 3D LV segmentation on echocardiography is still an\nopen and challenging task owing to the lower contrast, higher noise and data\ndimensionality, limited annotation of 3D echocardiography. In this paper, we\nproposed a novel real-time framework, i.e., VoxelAtlasGAN, for 3D LV\nsegmentation on 3D echocardiography. This framework has three contributions: 1)\nIt is based on voxel-to-voxel conditional generative adversarial nets (cGAN).\nFor the first time, cGAN is used for 3D LV segmentation on echocardiography.\nAnd cGAN advantageously fuses substantial 3D spatial context information from\n3D echocardiography by self-learning structured loss; 2) For the first time, it\nembeds the atlas into an end-to-end optimization framework, which uses 3D LV\natlas as a powerful prior knowledge to improve the inference speed, address the\nlower contrast and the limited annotation problems of 3D echocardiography; 3)\nIt combines traditional discrimination loss and the new proposed consistent\nconstraint, which further improves the generalization of the proposed\nframework.

These phantoms mimic the haptic and shape of organs of interest,\nbut lack a realistic visual appearance. In this work, we present an innovative\napplication in which representations learned from real intraoperative\nendoscopic sequences are transferred to a surgical phantom scenario. The term\nhyperrealism is introduced in this field, which we regard as a novel subform of\nsurgical augmented reality for approaches that involve real-time object\ntransfigurations. For related tasks in the computer vision community, unpaired\ncycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown excellent\nresults on still RGB images. Though, application of this approach to continuous\nvideo frames can result in flickering, which turned out to be especially\nprominent for this application. Therefore, we propose an extension of\ncycle-consistent GANs, named tempCycleGAN, to improve temporal consistency.The\nnovel method is evaluated on captures of a silicone phantom for training\nendoscopic reconstructive mitral valve procedures. Synthesized videos show\nhighly realistic results with regard to 1) replacement of the silicone\nappearance of the phantom valve by intraoperative tissue texture, while 2)\nexplicitly keeping crucial features in the scene, such as instruments, sutures\nand prostheses. Compared to the original CycleGAN approach, tempCycleGAN\nefficiently removes flickering between frames. The overall approach is expected\nto change the future design of surgical training simulators since the generated\nsequences clearly demonstrate the feasibility to enable a considerably more\nrealistic training experience for minimally-invasive procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 10:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

The\nHermitian adjacency matrix of a mixed graph with the vertex set $ \\{v_{1},\n\\ldots , v_{n}\\} $, is the matrix $ H=[h_{ij}]_{n \\times n} $, where $\nh_{ij}=-h_{ji}=i $ if there is a directed edge from $ v_{i} $ to $ v_{j} $, $\nh_{ij}=1 $ if there exists an undirected edge between $v_i$ and $v_{j}$, and\n$h_{ij}=0$ otherwise. The Hermitian spectrum of a mixed graph is defined to be\nthe spectrum of its Hermitian adjacency matrix. In this paper we study mixed\ngraphs which are determined by their Hermitian spectrum (DHS). First, we show\nthat each mixed cycle is switching equivalent to either a mixed cycle with no\ndirected edges ($C_{n}$), a mixed cycle with exactly one directed edge\n($C_{n}^{1}$), or a mixed cycle with exactly two consecutive directed edges\nwith the same direction ($C_{n}^{2}$) and we determine the spectrum of these\nthree types of cycles.

It is also shown that mixed paths of odd order, except\n$P_{3}$, are not DHS.

As a consequence, special electronic spin fluctuations have been invoked.\nHere, based on literature relaxation data it is shown that the electronic\nexcitations, to which the nuclei couple with a material and doping dependent\nanisotropy, are rather ubiquitous and Fermi liquid-like. A suppressed NMR spin\nshift rather than an enhanced relaxation leads to the failure of the Korringa\nlaw for most materials. Shift and relaxation below $T_{\\rm c}$ support the view\nof suppressed shifts, as well. A simple model of two coupled electronic spin\ncomponents, one with $3d(x^2-y^2)$ orbital symmetry and the other with an\nisotropic $s$-like interaction can explain the data.

An open question is how to best\nchoose the auxiliary noise distribution. We here propose a new method that\naddresses this issue.

In case that radio resources are not immediately schedulable,\nproposed scheduler forcibly enforces an artificial spatial user separation, for\nthe URLLC traffic to get instantly scheduled over shared resources with ongoing\neMBB transmissions. A pre-defined reference spatial subspace is constructed for\nwhich scheduler instantly picks the active eMBB user whose precoder is the\nclosest possible.

However, the main bottleneck that affects the communication\ncapability is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is the core of most\nmodulators. This study presents an on-chip implementation of pipeline\ndigit-slicing multiplier-less butterfly for FFT structure. The approach is\ntaken, in order to reduce computation complexity in the butterfly,\ndigit-slicing multiplier-less single constant technique was utilized in the\ncritical path of Radix-2 Decimation In Time (DIT) FFT structure. The proposed\ndesign focused on the trade-off between the speed and active silicon area for\nthe chip implementation. The new architecture was investigated and simulated\nwith MATLAB software. The Verilog HDL code in Xilinx ISE environment was\nderived to describe the FFT Butterfly functionality and was downloaded to\nVirtex II FPGA board. Consequently, the Virtex-II FG456 Proto board was used to\nimplement and test the design on the real hardware. As a result, from the\nfindings, the synthesis report indicates the maximum clock frequency of 549.75\nMHz with the total equivalent gate count of 31,159 is a marked and significant\nimprovement over Radix 2 FFT butterfly. In comparison with the conventional\nbutterfly architecture, the design that can only run at a maximum clock\nfrequency of 198.987 MHz and the conventional multiplier can only run at a\nmaximum clock frequency of 220.160 MHz, the proposed system exhibits better\nresults. The resulting maximum clock frequency increases by about 276.28% for\nthe FFT butterfly and about 277.06% for the multiplier. It can be concluded\nthat on-chip implementation of pipeline digit-slicing multiplier-less butterfly\nfor FFT structure is an enabler in solving problems that affect communications\ncapability in FFT and possesses huge potentials for future related works and\nresearch areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2018 21:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}
