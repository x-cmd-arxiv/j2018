According to the RRDPS protocol,\nlarger number of delay channels in interferometer can ensure higher tolerance\nof bit errors, eliminating the fundamental threshold of bit error rate of 11%\nof traditional BB84 protocol. Considering that the implementation of RRDPS\nprotocol relys on the realizaiton of the interferometer, therefore, an\ninterferometer with 128 selectable delay paths is constructed and demands the\nability of fast switching at the rate of 10 kHz, which requires dynamic\nstability of multiple paths. Thus, a specific designed phase stabilization\ntechnique with closed real time feedback loop is introduced to guarantee the\nhigh visibility of interferometer selections dynamically. The active phase\nstabilization technique employs a phase modulator (PM) driven by a DAC to\nadjust the relative phase between the two arms of the interferometer. By\nmonitoring photon counting rates of two Up-Conversion Detectors (UCD) at two\noutput ports of the interferometer, a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)\ncalculates and finds the optimal code value for the DAC, maintaining a high\nvisibility of the interferometer every time a new light path is selected. The\nvisibility of most of the 128 interferometer selections can simultaneously be\nmaintained over 96% during the QKD, which lays the foundation for the RRDPS\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 16:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

However, not only frequency\nbut also bus voltage will be affected by active power changes in\nsubtransmission networks due to a higher R/X ratio of transmission lines.\nFurther, the costs for loads participating in frequency and voltage regulation\nshould also be considered. In this paper, a control scheme is proposed for\nelectric spring (ES) aggregators which consist of back-to-back ESs and\nexponential type of noncritical loads in subtransmission networks. A\ndistributed optimization which aims to minimize the costs and implements both\nfrequency and voltage regulation is adopted for ES aggregators to obtain new\nactive and reactive power setpoints by sharing information with neighbors.\nPower consumption of each ES aggregator is then adjusted accordingly to conduct\nfrequency and voltage regulation simultaneously. Simulation results show that\nES aggregators are able to achieve required active power response and regulate\nfrequency cooperatively, and meanwhile maintain bus voltages within the\nacceptable range with minimized costs under the proposed control scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 16:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

Segmentation of arterial wall boundaries from the IVUS\nimages is not only crucial for quantitative analysis of the vessel walls and\nplaque characteristics, but is also necessary for generating 3D reconstructed\nmodels of the artery. The aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, we investigate\nthe feasibility of using a recently proposed region detector, namely Extremal\nRegion of Extremum Level (EREL) to delineate the luminal and media-adventitia\nborders in IVUS frames acquired by 20 MHz probes. Secondly, we propose a region\nselection strategy to label two ERELs as lumen and media based on the stability\nof their textural information. We extensively evaluated our selection strategy\non the test set of a standard publicly available dataset containing 326 IVUS\nB-mode images. We showed that in the best case, the average Hausdorff Distances\n(HD) between the extracted ERELs and the actual lumen and media were $0.22$ mm\nand $0.45$ mm, respectively. The results of our experiments revealed that our\nselection strategy was able to segment the lumen with $\\le 0.3$ mm HD to the\ngold standard even though the images contained major artifacts such as\nbifurcations, shadows, and side branches. Moreover, when there was no artifact,\nour proposed method was able to delineate media-adventitia boundaries with\n$0.31$ mm HD to the gold standard. Furthermore, our proposed segmentation\nmethod runs in time that is linear in the number of pixels in each frame. Based\non the results of this work, by using a 20 MHz IVUS probe with controlled\npullback, not only can we now analyze the internal structure of human arteries\nmore accurately, but also segment each frame during the pullback procedure\nbecause of the low run time of our proposed segmentation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 17:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

Research\nhas approached this important subject in many ways which resulted in various\ndifferent classes of boolean nets. But yet, they are only distinguished by the\nallowed interactions between places and transitions, that is, the possible\neffects of firing transitions. There are eight different interactions: no\noperation (nop), input (inp), output (out), set, reset (res), swap, test of\noccupation (used), and test of disposability (free). Considering every\ncombination for a possible net class yields 256 boolean classes in total. The\nsynthesis problem for a particular class is to take an automaton A and compute\na boolean net of that class that has a state graph isomorphic to A. To the best\nof our knowledge, the computational complexity of this problem has been\nanalyzed for just two of the 256 classes, namely elementary nets systems (nop,\ninp, out), where the problem is NP-hard, and flip-flop nets (nop, inp, out,\nswap), which are synthesizable in polynomial time. However, depending on the\ndesired net features, like read-only places, exception handling, or hierarchy,\none has to synthesize nets with other interactions as for instance contextual\nnets (nop, inp, out, used, free) or trace nets (nop, inp, out, set, res, used,\nfree). The contribution of this paper is a thorough investigation of the\nsynthesis complexity for the 128 boolean net classes that allow nop.

In\nparticular, a fairly straightforward application of this technique allows one\nto locate, for each non-bipartite graph $H$, the threshold at which the\ndistribution of edges in a typical $H$-free graph with a given number of edges\nundergoes a transition from 'random-like' to 'structured'. On the other hand,\nfor non-monotone hereditary graph properties the standard version of this\nmethod does not allow one to establish even the existence of such a threshold.\n  In this paper we introduce a refinement of the container method that takes\ninto account the asymmetry between edges and non-edges in a sparse member of a\nhereditary graph property. As an application, we determine the approximate\nstructure of a typical graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and no induced copy\nof the $4$-cycle, for each function $m = m(n)$ satisfying $n^{4/3} (\\log n)^4\n\\leqslant m \\ll n^2$. We show that almost all such graphs $G$ have the\nfollowing property: the vertex set of $G$ can be partitioned into an\n'almost-independent' set (a set with $o(m)$ edges) and an 'almost-clique' (a\nset inducing a subgraph with density $1-o(1)$). The lower bound on $m$ is\noptimal up to a polylogarithmic factor, as standard arguments show that if $n\n\\ll m \\ll n^{4/3}$, then almost all such graphs are 'random-like'. As a further\nconsequence, we deduce that the random graph $G(n,p)$ conditioned to contain no\ninduced $4$-cycles undergoes phase transitions at $p = n^{-2/3 + o(1)}$ and $p\n= n^{-1/3 + o(1)}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 18:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

The assembly of the\nchains is mediated by a low fraction of interchain crosslinks. The microgels\nare polydisperse in size and shape but globally spherical objects. In order to\ndeeply understand the microgel structure and eventually improve the synthesis\nprotocol we characterize their conformational properties and deswelling\nkinetics, and compare them with the results found for microgels obtained via\nunderlying regular (diamond-like) structures. The specific microstructure of\nthe microgel has no significant effect on the locus of the volume phase\ntransition (VPT). However, it strongly affects the deswelling kinetics, as\nrevealed by a consistent analysis of the domain growth during the microgel\ncollapse. Though both the disordered and the regular networks exhibit a similar\nearly growth of the domains, an acceleration is observed in the regular network\nat the late stage of the collapse. Similar trends are found for the dynamic\ncorrelations coupled to the domain growth. As a consequence, the fast late\nprocesses for the domain growth and the dynamic correlations in the regular\nnetwork are compensated, and the dynamic correlations follow a power-law\ndependence on the growing length scale that is independent of the microgel\nmicrostructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 19:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

The lead samples were cut from the SINQ spallation\ntarget at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) and irradiated in 2000/2001 by 575\nMeV protons. The Po-isotopes were separated using radiochemical methods by the\ngroup of D. Schumann at PSI and measured. Choosing the default model in MCNPX,\nBertini-Dresner, the prediction underestimated the measured activities by up to\nseveral orders of magnitude. Therefore the Li\\`ege intranuclear-cascade model\n(INCL4.6) coupled to the de-excitation model ABLA07 were implemented into\nMCNPX2.7.0 and very good agreement was found to the measurement. The reason for\nthe disagreement was traced back to a suppression of alpha reactions on the\nlead isotopes leading to Po and neglecting the triton capture on Pb-208, which\nleads to Pb-210 and decays into Po-210 with a much longer life time (22.3\nyears) than the decay of Po-210 itself (138 days). The prediction of the\nPo-isotope activities turns out to be a sensitive test for models and codes as\nit requires the accurate treatment of reaction channels not only with neutrons,\nprotons and pions but also with alphas and tritons, which are not considered in\nintra-nuclear cascade models of the first generation. Therefore it was decided\nto perform a benchmark by comparing the results obtained with MCNPX2.7.0 using\nINCL4.6/ABLA07 to the predictions of FLUKA and Geant4. Since the model of the\nSINQ spallation source requires an elaborate geometry a toy model was setup.\nThe toy model has a simplified geometry preserving the main features of the\noriginal geometry. The results for the activities of the three Po-isotopes and\nPb-210 as well as the energy spectra for alphas and tritons obtained with the\nthree particle transport Monte Carlo codes are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 21:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

An often overlooked\naspect is that new items with limited observations arrive continuously in many\ndomains (e.g. news and discussion forums). Therefore, recommendations need to\nbe adaptive to such frequent changes. In this paper, we benchmark a new\nnonparametric method called context tree (CT) against various state-of-the-art\nmethods on extensive datasets for session-based recommendation task. Apart from\nthe standard static evaluation protocol adopted by previous literatures, we\ninclude an adaptive configuration to mimic the situation when new items with\nlimited observations arrives continuously. Our results show that CT outperforms\ntwo best-performing approaches (recurrent neural network; heuristic-based\nnearest neighbor) in majority of the tested configurations and datasets. We\nanalyze reasons for this and demonstrate that it is because of the better\nadaptation to changes in the domain, as well as the remarkable capability to\nlearn static sequential patterns.

This problem further becomes intense when complexity of\ndiseasees increases as in the case of vector-borne diseases (VBD). The VBDs are\nhuman illnesses caused by pathogens transmitted among humans by intermediate\nspecies, which are primarily arthropods. In this study, a stochastic VBD model\nis developed and novel mathematical methods are described and evaluated to\nsystematically analyze the model and understand its complex dynamics. The VBD\nmodel incorporates some relevant features of the VBD transmission process\nincluding demographical, ecological and social mechanisms. The analysis is\nbased on dimensional reductions and model simplications via scaling limit\ntheorems. The results suggest that the dynamics of the stochastic VBD depends\non a threshold quantity R_0, the initial size of infectives, and the type of\nscaling in terms of host population size. The quantity R_0 for deterministic\ncounterpart of the model, interpreted as threshold condition for infection\npersistence as is mentioned in the literature for many infectious disease\nmodels, can be computed. Different scalings yield different approximations of\nthe model, and in particular, if vectors have much faster dynamics, the effect\nof the vector dynamics on the host population averages out, which largely\nreduces the dimension of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 02:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

We model the\nwater cycle taking seafloor hydrothermal alteration, chemical alteration of\ncontinental crust, slab subduction, hydrogen escape from the early Earth, and\ndegassing at mid-ocean ridges, hot spots, and arcs into account. The\ndifferences in D/H ratios between present-day oceans, oceanic and continental\ncrust, and mantle are thought to reflect isotopic fractionation through\nseafloor alteration, chemical alteration, and slab dehydration. However, if the\nspeed of plate tectonics has been nearly constant through out Earth's history,\nthe degassing and regassing rates are too small to reach the present-day D/H\nratios. We show that (a) hydrogen escape from reduced early atmosphere, (b)\nsecular net regassing, or (c) faster plate tectonics on early Earth is needed\nto reproduce the present-day D/H ratios of the water reservoirs. The low D/H\nratio of Archean seawater at 3.8 Ga has previously been interpreted as a\nsignature of (a) hydrogen escape, but we find it can also be explained either\nby (b) secular net regassing or by (c) faster plate tectonics on early Earth.\nThe rates of hydrogen escape from early Earth and secular regassing on\npresent-day Earth are constrained to be lower than 2.1 x 10^11 kg/yr and 3.9 x\n10^11 kg/yr. Consequently, the volume of water in the present-day mantle could\nresult entirely from the regassing through Earth's history. In that case, the\nvolume of initial oceans could be 2 to 3 times larger than that of current\nEarth.

The evacuation problem is\nto evacuate all flow to sinks assuming that all flow is confluent, i.e., all\nflow passing through a particular vertex must follow the same exit edge. The\n$k$-sink location problem is to place $k$-sinks so as to minimize this\nevacuation time. Although the $k$-sink location problem is NP-Hard on a general\ngraph it can be solved in $\\tilde O(k^2 n)$ time on trees.\n  The concept of minmax-regret arises from robust optimization.

We find that there is a critical\nangle $\\theta_\\mathrm{cr}$ above which the shock-amplified magnetic field\ncontrols the post-shock gas dynamics. If the atomic gas is compressed almost\nalong the mean magnetic field ($\\theta\\ll\\theta_\\mathrm{cr}$), super-Alfv\\'enic\nanisotropic turbulence is maintained by the accretion of the highly\ninhomogeneous upstream atomic gas. As a result, a greatly extended\nturbulence-dominated post-shock layer is generated.

Consequently, many\nalgorithms for the analysis and the comparison of networks (such as alignment\nalgorithms) have been developed in the past. Recently, many different\napproaches tried to integrate into a single model the interplay of different\nmolecules, such as genes, transcription factors and microRNAs. A possible\nformalism to model such scenario comes from node coloured networks (or\nheterogeneous networks) implemented as node/ edge-coloured graphs.\nConsequently, the need for the introduction of alignment algorithms able to\nanalyse heterogeneous networks arises. To the best of our knowledge, all the\nexisting algorithms are not able to mine heterogeneous networks. We propose a\ntwo-step alignment strategy that receives as input two heterogeneous networks\n(node-coloured graphs) and a similarity function among nodes of two networks\nextending the previous formulations. We first build a single alignment graph.\nThen we mine this graph extracting relevant subgraphs. Despite this simple\napproach, the analysis of such networks relies on graph and subgraph\nisomorphism and the size of the data is still growing. Therefore the use of\nhigh-performance data analytics framework is needed. We here present\nHetNetAligner a framework built on top of Apache Spark.

This\nclassification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a\nprojected distance of 1kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important\nrefinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly as it\nprovides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and\nis more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNeIa in\npredominantly younger environments are DY=0.163\\pm0.029 mag (5.7 sigma) fainter\nthan those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve\nstandardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic\nconnected to host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established\nstep in standardized brightnesses between SNeIa in hosts with lower or higher\ntotal stellar masses is smaller at DM=0.119\\pm0.032 mag (4.5 sigma), for the\nsame set of SNeIa. When fit simultaneously, the environment age offset remains\nvery significant, with DY=0.129\\pm0.032 mag (4.0 sigma), while the global\nstellar mass step is reduced to DM=0.064\\pm0.029 mag (2.2 sigma). Thus,\napproximately 70% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an\nunderlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Standardization\nusing only the SNeIa in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from\n0.142\\pm0.008 mag to 0.120\\pm0.010 mag. We show that as environment ages evolve\nwith redshift a strong bias on measurement of the dark energy equation of state\nparameters can develop. Fortunately, data to measure and correct for this\neffect is likely to be available for many next-generation experiments.\n[abstract shorten]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 07:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 10:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

It has been shown that determining a\nrealistic population size is tricky as many parameters (such as infertility,\ninbreeding, sudden deaths, accidents or random events) come into play. To\nevaluate the impact of those parameters, Monte Carlo simulations are among the\nbest methods since they allow testing of all possible scenarios and determine,\nby numerous iterations, which are the most likely. This is why we use the Monte\nCarlo code HERITAGE to estimate the minimal crew for a multi-generational space\ntravel towards Proxima Centauri b. By allowing the crew to evolve under a list\nof adaptive social engineering principles (namely yearly evaluations of the\nvessel population, offspring restrictions and breeding constraints), we show in\nthis paper that it is possible to create and maintain a healthy population\nvirtually indefinitely.

To\nefficiently manage the multi-dimensional heterogeneous resources, a\nservice-oriented network slicing approach is introduced, where the AGIVEN is\nvirtually divided into multiple slices and each slice supports a specific\napplication with guaranteed quality of service (QoS). Specifically, the\nfundamental problem of multi-resource provisioning in AGIVEN slicing is\ninvestigated, by taking into account typical vehicular applications of\nlocation-based map and popularity-based content services. For the\nlocation-based map service, the capability of HAP-vehicle proactive pushing is\nderived with respect to the HAP broadcast rate and vehicle cache size, wherein\na saddle point exists indicating the optimal communication-cache resource\ntrading. For the popular contents of common interests, the average on-board\ncontent hit ratio is obtained, with HAPs pushing newly generated contents to\nkeep on-board cache fresh. Then, the minimal RSU transmission rate is derived\nto meet the average delay requirements of each slice. The obtained analytical\nresults reveal the service-dependent resource provisioning and trading\nrelationships among RSU transmission rate, HAP broadcast rate, and vehicle\ncache size, which provides guidelines for multi-resource network slicing in\npractice. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AGIVEN network\nslicing approach matches the multi-resources across slices, whereby the RSU\ntransmission rate can be saved by 40% while maintaining the same QoS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

Heat is thought to be\nreleased by electroweak and nuclear processes triggered by the burying of ashes\nof X-ray bursts. The heating is studied using a fully quantum approach taking\nconsistently into account nuclear shell effects. We have followed the evolution\nof ashes made of $^{56}$Fe employing the nuclear energy-density functional\ntheory. Both the outer and inner crusts are described using the same\nfunctional, thus ensuring a unified and thermodynamically consistent treatment.\nTo assess the role of the neutron-matter constraint, we have employed the set\nof accurately calibrated Brussels-Montreal functionals BSk19, BSk20, and BSk21\nand for comparison the SLy4 functional. Due to nuclear shell effects, the fully\naccreted crust is found to be much less stratified than in previous studies. In\nparticular, large regions of the inner crust contain clusters with the magic\nnumber $Z=14$. The heat deposited in the outer crust is tightly constrained by\nexperimental atomic mass data. The shallow heating we obtain does not exceed\n$0.2$~MeV and is therefore not enough to explain the cooling of some soft X-ray\ntransients. The total heat released in the crust is very sensitive to details\nof the nuclear structure and is predicted to lie in the range from $1.5$~MeV to\n$1.7$~MeV. The evolution of an accreted matter element and therefore the\nlocation of heat sources are governed to a large extent by the existence of\nnuclear shell closures. Ignoring these effects in the inner crust, the total\nheat falls to $\\sim 0.6$~MeV. The neutron-matter constraint is also found to\nplay a key role. The large amount of heat obtained by Steiner et al.

This captures settings such as valuations for artwork, oil\ndrilling rights, broadcast rights, and many more.\n  In the interdependent value setting, all previous work has assumed a\nso-called {\\sl single-crossing condition}. Single-crossing means that the\nimpact of agent $i$'s private signal, $s_i$, on her own valuation is greater\nthan the impact of $s_i$ on the valuation of any other agent. It is known that\nwithout the single-crossing condition an efficient outcome cannot be obtained.\nWe study welfare maximization for interdependent valuations through the lens of\napproximation.\n  We show that, in general, without the single-crossing condition, one cannot\nhope to approximate the optimal social welfare any better than the\napproximation given by assigning the item to a random bidder. Consequently, we\nintroduce a relaxed version of single-crossing, {\\sl $c$-single-crossing},\nparameterized by $c\\geq 1$, which means that the impact of $s_i$ on the\nvaluation of agent $i$ is at least $1/c$ times the impact of $s_i$ on the\nvaluation of any other agent ($c=1$ is single-crossing).

NGC 253 is one of only two starburst galaxies found to\nemit $\\gamma$-rays from hundreds of MeV to multi-TeV energies. Accurate\nmeasurements of the very-high-energy (VHE) (E $>$ 100 GeV) and high-energy (HE)\n(E $>$ 60 MeV) spectra are crucial to study the underlying particle\naccelerators and cosmic-ray interaction and transport.\n  Aims. The measurement of the VHE $\\gamma$-ray emission of NGC 253 published\nin 2012 by H.E.S.S. was limited by large systematic uncertainties. Here, a\nmeasurement of the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum of NGC 253 is investigated in both HE\nand VHE $\\gamma$-rays.\n  Methods. The data of H.E.S.S. observations are reanalysed using an updated\ncalibration and analysis chain. The $Fermi$-LAT analysis employs more than 8\nyears of data processed using pass 8. The cosmic-ray particle population is\nevaluated from the combined HE--VHE $\\gamma$-ray spectrum using NAIMA.\n  Results. The VHE $\\gamma$-ray energy spectrum is best fit by a power-law with\na flux normalisation of\n$(1.34\\,\\pm\\,0.14^{\\mathrm{stat}}\\,\\pm\\,0.27^{\\mathrm{sys}}) \\times 10^{-13}\n\\mathrm{cm^{-2} s^{-1} TeV^{-1}}$ at 1 TeV -- about 40 \\% above, but compatible\nwith the value obtained in Abramowski et al.

Furthermore, in finite sequences of trials the rate of reward is\nmaximized when the observer deliberates longer for early decisions, but\nresponds more quickly towards the end of the sequence.

One framework to study such\ndynamics is that of fractal geometry. However, currently there exists no\nestablished method for the study of brain dynamics using fractal geometry, due\nto the many challenges in the conceptual and technical understanding of the\nmethods. We aim to highlight some of the practical challenges of applying\nfractal geometry to brain dynamics and propose solutions to enable its wider\nuse in neuroscience. Using intracranially recorded EEG and simulated data, we\ncompared monofractal and multifractal methods with regards to their sensitivity\nto signal variance. We found that both correlate closely with signal variance,\nthus not offering new information about the signal. However, after applying an\nepoch-wise standardisation procedure to the signal, we found that multifractal\nmeasures could offer non-redundant information compared to signal variance,\npower and other established EEG signal measures. We also compared different\nmultifractal estimation methods and found that the Chhabra-Jensen algorithm\nperformed best. Finally, we investigated the impact of sampling frequency and\nepoch length on multifractal properties. Using epileptic seizures as an example\nevent in the EEG, we show that there may be an optimal time scale for detecting\ntemporal changes in multifractal properties around seizures. The practical\nissues we highlighted and our suggested solutions should help in developing a\nrobust method for the application of fractal geometry in EEG signals.

Worker and student mobility flows are among the\nmost weekly regular displacements and consequently generate road congestion\nproblems. Estimating their round-trips eases the decision-making processes for\nlocal authorities. Worker and student censuses often contain home location,\nwork places and educational institutions. We thus propose a neural network\nmodel that learns the temporal distribution of displacements from other\nmobility sources and tries to predict them on new censuses data.

Prominent\nexamples are circular resonators with high quality factors that allow the\ncoupling of optical whispering gallery modes to microwave cavities or magnon\nresonances in optomagnonics. Whispering gallery modes play a special role in\nthis endeavour because of their high quality factor and strong localisation,\nwhich ultimately increases the overlap of the wavefunctions of quantum\nparticles in hybridised systems. The hybridisation with magnons, the collective\nquantum excitations of the electron spins in a magnetically ordered material,\nis of particular interest because magnons can take over two functionalities:\ndue to their collective nature they are robust and can serve as a quantum\nmemory and, moreover, they can act as a wavelength converter between microwave\nand THz photons. However, the observation of whispering gallery magnons has not\nyet been achieved due to the lack of efficient excitation schemes for magnons\nwith large wave vectors in a circular geometry.

Some quantum walks, referred to as the Weyl and Dirac\nquantum walks, provide a description of the free evolution of relativistic\nquantum fields in a regime where the wave-vectors involved in the particle\nstate are small. The clash between the intrinsic discreteness of quantum walks\nand the symmetries of special relativity can be resolved by rethinking the\nnotion of a change of inertial reference frame.

This symmetry group contains a non linear realization of\n$SO^+(2,1)\n  \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^3$; since one of the two space-like dimensions does not\ncorrespond to an actual spatial degree of freedom but rather the mass, we\ninterpret it as a 2+1 dimensional de-Sitter group.

Given the spectrum of an\nexoplanetary atmosphere, a multi-parameter space is swept through in real time\nto find the best-fit model.

Such methods are very\ntime-consuming and by necessity there is a compromise between physical and\nchemical realism versus computational feasibility. Machine learning has\npreviously been used to determine which molecules to include in the model, but\nthe retrieval itself was still performed using standard methods. Here, we\nreport an adaptation of the random forest method of supervised machine\nlearning, trained on a pre-computed grid of atmospheric models, which retrieves\nfull posterior distributions of the abundances of molecules and the cloud\nopacity. The use of a pre-computed grid allows a large part of the\ncomputational burden to be shifted offline.

Thus, we break the rigid\nseparation between forcing and response, which is key in linear response\ntheory, and revisit the concept of causality. As a result, the surrogate Green\nfunctions one constructs for predicting the response of the observable of\ninterest may have support that is not necessarily limited to the nonnegative\ntime axis. This implies that not all observables are equally good as\npredictands when a given forcing is applied, as result of the properties of\ntheir corresponding susceptibility.

We derive general explicit formulas that, in absence\nof such pathologies, allow one to reconstruct the response of an observable of\ninterest to N independent forcings by using as predictors N other observables.\nWe provide a thorough test of the theory and of the possible pathologies by\nusing numerical simulations of the paradigmatic Lorenz '96 model.

In such\nmulti-modal energy systems, it is challenging to determine the effect of an\nindividual player's consumption pattern onto overall CO$_2$ emissions. This,\nhowever, is often important to evaluate the suitability of local CO$_2$\nreduction measures. Due to renewables' volatility, the traditional approach of\nusing annual average CO$_2$ intensities per energy form is no longer accurate,\nbut the time of consumption should be considered. Moreover, CO$_2$ intensities\nare highly coupled over time and different energy forms due to sector coupling\nand energy storage. We introduce and compare two novel methods for computing\ntime-dependent CO$_2$ intensities, that address different objectives: the first\nmethod determines CO$_2$ intensities of the energy system as is. The second\nmethod analyzes how overall CO$_2$ emissions would change in response to\ninfinitesimal demand changes. Given a digital twin of the energy system in form\nof a linear program, we show how to compute these sensitivities very\nefficiently. We present the results of both methods for two simulated test\nenergy systems and discuss their different implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 14:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 08:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 08:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Empirically measured networks and dynamic processes that take place\nin these situations show heterogeneous, non-Markovian, and intrinsically\ncorrelated topologies and dynamics. This makes their analysis particularly\nchallenging. Randomized reference models (RRMs) have emerged as a general and\nversatile toolbox for studying such systems. Defined as random networks with\ngiven features constrained to match those of an input (empirical) network, they\nmay, for example, be used to identify important features of empirical networks\nand their effects on dynamical processes unfolding in the network. RRMs are\ntypically implemented as procedures that reshuffle an empirical network, making\nthem very generally applicable. However, the effects of most shuffling\nprocedures on network features remain poorly understood, rendering their use\nnontrivial and susceptible to misinterpretation. Here we propose a unified\nframework for classifying and understanding microcanonical RRMs (MRRMs) that\nsample networks with uniform probability. Focusing on temporal networks, we\nsurvey applications of MRRMs found in the literature, and we use this framework\nto build a taxonomy of MRRMs that proposes a canonical naming convention,\nclassifies them, and deduces their effects on a range of important network\nfeatures. We furthermore show that certain classes of MRRMs may be applied in\nsequential composition to generate new MRRMs from the existing ones surveyed in\nthis article. We finally provide a tutorial showing how to apply a series of\nMRRMs to analyze how different network features affect a dynamic process in an\nempirical temporal network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 14:53:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 15:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 10:24:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 15:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

The population\ndensities of energy levels of ions CI, CII and OI and molecules H$_2$, CO,\nH$_2$O are computed in parallel with the dynamical and chemical rate equations.\nThe large velocity gradient approximation is used in the line radiative\ntransfer calculations. The simulations consist of two steps: (i) modelling of\nthe chemical and thermal evolution of a static molecular cloud and (ii) shock\nsimulations. A comparison is made with the results of publicly available models\nof similar physical systems.\n  The focus of the paper is on the chemical processing of gas material and ice\nmantles of dust grains by the shock. Sputtering of ice mantles takes place in\nthe shock region close to the temperature peak of the neutral gas. At high\nshock speeds, molecules ejected from ice mantles are effectively destroyed in\nhot gas, and their survival time is low - of the order of dozens of years.\nAfter a passage of high-speed C-type shock, a zone of high abundance of atomic\nhydrogen appears in the cooling postshock gas that triggers formation of\ncomplex organic species such as methanol.

This challenge is especially acute within the medical image domain,\nparticularly when pathologies are involved, due to two factors: 1) limited\nnumber of cases, and 2) large variations in location, scale, and appearance. In\nthis work, we investigate whether augmenting a dataset with artificially\ngenerated lung nodules can improve the robustness of the progressive\nholistically nested network (P-HNN) model for pathological lung segmentation of\nCT scans. To achieve this goal, we develop a 3D generative adversarial network\n(GAN) that effectively learns lung nodule property distributions in 3D space.\nIn order to embed the nodules within their background context, we condition the\nGAN based on a volume of interest whose central part containing the nodule has\nbeen erased. To further improve realism and blending with the background, we\npropose a novel multi-mask reconstruction loss. We train our method on over\n1000 nodules from the LIDC dataset. Qualitative results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-art. We then use our GAN\nto generate simulated training images where nodules lie on the lung border,\nwhich are cases where the published P-HNN model struggles. Qualitative and\nquantitative results demonstrate that armed with these simulated images, the\nP-HNN model learns to better segment lung regions under these challenging\nsituations. As a result, our system provides a promising means to help overcome\nthe data paucity that commonly afflicts medical imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 15:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

We describe a method to correct these imbalances\nwithout making any change in the analog part of the sideband-separating\nreceiver, specifically, keeping the intermediate-frequency hybrid in place.\nThis opens the possibility of implementing the method in any existing receiver.\nWe have built hardware to demonstrate the validity of the method and tested it\non a fully analog receiver operating between 600 and 720GHz. We have tested the\nstability of calibration and performance vs time and after full resets of the\nreceiver. We have performed an error analysis to compare the digital\ncompensation in two configurations of analog receivers, with and without\nintermediate frequency (IF) hybrid. An average compensated sideband rejection\nratio of 46dB is obtained. Degradation of the compensated sideband rejection\nratio on time and after several resets of the receiver is minimal. A receiver\nwith an IF hybrid is more robust to systematic errors. Moreover, we have shown\nthat the intrinsic random errors in calibration have the same impact for\nconfiguration without IF hybrid and for a configuration with IF hybrid with\nanalog rejection ratio better than 10dB. Compensated rejection ratios above\n40dB are obtained even in the presence of high analog rejection. The method is\nrobust allowing its use under normal operational conditions at any telescope.\nWe also demonstrate that a full analog receiver is more robust against\nsystematic errors. Finally, the error bars associated to the compensated\nrejection ratio are almost independent of whether IF hybrid is present or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 15:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

In particular, a joint multi-scale feature encoder is\nlearned by optimizing the segmentation branch and the motion estimation branch\nsimultaneously. This enables the weakly-supervised segmentation by taking\nadvantage of features that are unsupervisedly learned in the motion estimation\nbranch from a large amount of unannotated data.

In this paper, by explicitly\nconsidering users' contact and inter-contact durations via an alternating\nrenewal process, we first investigate the effect of mobility with a given cache\nplacement.

Specifically, the shape and morphology of local stellar haloes have\nencoded in them the early formation history of their parent galaxies. Early\nprogenitor galaxies were absorbed by the dark halo and scattered their stars in\na diffuse halo around the main galaxy. If the accretion event was relatively\nrecent, it may show as a coherent stream of stars within the halo. in addition,\nthe low-mass, low-surface brightness satellite galaxies, perhaps the\nultradiffuse galaxies recently reported would help solve the \"Missing Dwarf\nProblem\", the apparent over-prediction of $\\Lambda$CDM models of the number of\nsatellite galaxies around a Milky Way Halo.\n  However low surface brightness is not what most telescopes are optimized for,\nmost are best for resolving point sources and not sensitivity for large-scale\nlow-light. To be sensitive to the low surface brightness Universe, a telescope\nneeds a simple, unobstructed light path (disfavoring mirrors), fast optics (low\nf/D), and relatively coarse sampling (big pixels). Exceptions are the superb\nDragonfly and Huntsman telescopes which are purposely designed to be sensitive\nto low surface brighnesses. Similarly designed, if not with low surface\nbrightness in mind is the successfully launched TESS satellite. We show in this\nResearch Note that the envisaged total exposure times and optical setup are\nnear-ideal for low surface brightness work in the local Universe.\n  With combined TESS imaging, one can model the stellar halo surrounding a\ngalaxy. Technical challenges include the image quality, zodiacal and Galactic\ncirrus background light, PSF characterization and subtraction. Once accounted\nfor with a processing pipeline, one can model the stellar halo for all nearby\ngalaxies and to search for substructure in these haloes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 02:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In this paper, we investigate the additional deflection of light in\nthe vacuum region surrounding the Sun by its electromagnetic parameters.\nStarting with Maxwell's equations, we show how the deflection of light passing\nthe Sun depends on the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability of\nthe interior of the Sun.

Accordingly, deploying new applications\nentails dedicating some of these processes to a private cloud solution, while\nallocating others to the public cloud. In this context, the present work is set\nto help minimize relevant costs and deliver effective choices for an optimal\nservice placement solution within minimal execution time. Several evolutionary\nalgorithms have been applied to solve the service placement problem and are\nused when dealing with complex solution spaces to provide an optimal placement\nand often produce a short execution time.

Hence an equal error rate (EER) of\n8.7 percent and an average correct verification rate of 91.3 percent\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2018 19:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

Loss of Sn is observed in sample S2 due to high\ntemperature thermal treatment.The isomer shifts obtained in the Mossbauer\nspectra confirms the existence of Sn at its 4+ valance state in both the\nsamples. Relatively high quadriple splitting is observed in S1 with respect to\nS2, suggesting dislocations and crystal distortion present in S1, which are\nreduced drastically by high temperature annealed S2 sample. The fabricated\nsolar cell with S1 and S2 absorbers showed significant improvement in\nefficiency from ~0.145% to ~1%. The presence of excess Sn in S1 allows enhanced\nrecombination and the diode ideality factor shows larger value of 4.23 compared\nto 2.17 in case of S2. The experiments also validate the fact that S1 with Sn\nrich configuration shows lower acceptor carrier concentration as compared to S2\nbecause of enhanced compensating defects in S1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 13:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}
