This introduces several\nundesirable complexities while analytically dealing with the stationary\nintegral accretion solutions and the corresponding phase portraits. We propose\nthat introduction of an effective dynamical sound speed may resolve the issue\nin an elegant way. We linear perturb the full spacetime-dependent general\nrelativistic Euler and the continuity equations governing the structure and the\ndynamics of accretion disc in vertical equilibrium around Schwarzschild black\nholes and identify the sonic metric embedded within the stationary background\nflow. Such metric describes the propagation of the linear acoustic perturbation\ninside the accretion flow.

A large fraction of the interstellar medium can be characterized as\na multiphase medium. The neutral hydrogen gas is bistable with a cold and warm\nneutral medium (CNM and WNM respectively) but there is evidence for an\nadditional phase at intermediate temperatures, a lukewarm neutral medium (LNM)\nthat is thermally unstable. Aims. We use all sky data from the HI4PI survey to\nseparate these neutral HI phases with the aim to determine their distribution\nand phase fractions in the local interstellar medium. Methods. HI4PI\nobservations, gridded on an nside = 1024 HEALPix grid, were decomposed into\nGaussian components. From the frequency distribution of the velocity\ndispersions we infer three separate linewidth regimes. Accordingly we extract\nthe HI line emission corresponding to the CNM, LNM, and WNM. We generated\nall-sky maps of these phases in the local HI gas with -8 < v_LSR < 8 km/s.\nResults. Each of the HI phases shows distinct structures on all scales. The LNM\nnever exists as a single phase but contributes on average 41% of the HI. The\nCNM is prominent only for 22% of the sky, contributes there on average 34% but\nlocally up to 60% of the HI and is associated with dust at temperatures T_dust\n~ 18.6 K. Embedded cold filaments show a clear anti-correlation between CNM and\nLNM. Also the smoothly distributed WNM is anti-correlated with the CNM. It\ncontributes for the rest of the sky 39% with dust associated at temperatures\nT_dust ~ 19.4 K. Conclusions. The CNM in filaments exists on small scales. Here\nthe observed anti-correlation between LNM and CNM implies that both, filaments\nand the surrounding more extended LNM, must have a common origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 16:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 09:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

In many cases there are only two possible extinction probability vectors\nand so far, in more complicated examples, only a finite number of distinct\nextinction probability vectors had been explicitly found. Whether a branching\nrandom walk could have an infinite number of distinct extinction probability\nvectors was not known. We apply our results to construct examples of branching\nrandom walks with uncountably many distinct extinction probability vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 16:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-12"}

The relative performance of chirp LiDEER\nand Laser-IMD in terms of modulation-to-noise ratio is found to depend on the\ndipolar evolution time: While LaserIMD yields higher modulation-to-noise ratios\nthan LiDEER at short dipolar evolution times ({\\tau}=2 {\\mu}s), the high phase\nmemory time of the triplet spins causes the situation to revert at {\\tau}=6\n{\\mu}s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 18:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

The optimal method to detect streaks in astronomical\nimages is by cross-correlating the image with a template of a line broadened by\nthe point spread function of the system.

Although several plausible mechanisms for this elevated\nvelocity dispersion (e.g. star formation feedback, elevated gas supply, or more\nfrequent galaxy interactions) have been proposed, the fundamental driver of the\nvelocity dispersion enhancement at high redshift remains unclear. We\ninvestigate the origin of this kinematic evolution using a suite of\ncosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments)\nproject. Although IFS surveys generally cover a wider range of stellar masses\nthan in these simulations, the simulated galaxies show trends between intrinsic\nvelocity dispersion, SFR, and redshift in agreement with observations. In both\nthe observed and simulated galaxies, intrinsic velocity dispersion is\npositively correlated with SFR. Intrinsic velocity dispersion increases with\nredshift out to z~1 and then flattens beyond that. In the FIRE simulations,\nintrinsic velocity dispersion can vary significantly on timescales of <100 Myr.\nThese variations closely mirror the time evolution of the SFR and gas inflow\nrate. By cross-correlating pairs of intrinsic velocity dispersion, gas inflow\nrate, and SFR, we show that increased gas inflow leads to subsequent enhanced\nstar formation, and enhancements in intrinsic velocity dispersion tend to\ntemporally coincide with increases in gas inflow rate and SFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 20:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

For most of the\nperovskite based materials we analyzed, the band-to-band recombination rate\nremains close to the radiative limit, leading to the expected sub-microsecond\nlifetime. The slow diffusion of charge carriers is observed with values of the\ndiffusion coefficient D around 5x10-3 cm2/s. Nonetheless, the power conversion\nefficiency remains high. The observations might be related to the debated\ncoexistence of a direct and indirect bandgap slowing down the recombination\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 21:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 11:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Recent studies found that along a vehicle platoon described in the\nLagrangian specification, traffic oscillations grow in a concave way. Since\nstationary bottlenecks are more intuitively described in the Eulerian\nframework, this paper investigates whether the concave growth pattern of\ntraffic oscillations in the Lagrangian coordinates can be transferred to the\nEuler coordinates (i.e. the concave increase in standard deviation is no longer\nmeasured across the vehicle indices but as a function of the road location). To\nthis end, we theoretically unify these two ways of measuring oscillations by\nrevealing their mapping relationship. We show that the growth pattern measured\nin the Lagrangian coordinates can be transferred to the Euler coordinates. We\nbelieve this finding is nontrivial since the scenarios are significantly\ndifferent: while in vehicle platoons (Lagrangian view, non-penetrable moving\nbottleneck), the speed variance for a given vehicle is ideally constant, the\ndrivers in the Eulerian setting (penetrable stationary bottleneck triggering\nthe waves) experience all amplitudes, first the big ones and then the small\nones.

On the algebraic side, parking\nfunctions can be identified with the standard monomials of $M_n$, a certain\nmonomial ideal in the polynomial ring $S = {\\mathbb K}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$ where\na set of generators are indexed by the nonempty subsets of $[n] =\n\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$. Motivated by constructions from the theory of chip-firing on\ngraphs we study generalizations of parking functions determined by $M^{(k)}_n$,\na subideal of $M_n$ obtained by allowing only generators corresponding to\nsubsets of $[n]$ of size at most $k$. For each $k$ the set of standard\nmonomials of $M^{(k)}_n$, denoted $\\text{stan}_n^k$, contains the usual parking\nfunctions and has interesting combinatorial properties in its own right. For\ngeneral $k$ we show that elements of $\\text{stan}_n^k$ can be recovered as\ncertain vector-parking functions, which in turn leads to a formula for their\ncount via results of Yan. The symmetric group $S_n$ naturally acts on the set\n$\\text{stan}_n^k$ and we also obtain a formula for the number of orbits under\nthis action. For the case of $k = n-2$ we study combinatorial interpretations\nof $\\text{stan}_n^{n-2}$ and relate them to properties of uprooted trees in\nterms of root degree and surface inversions. As a corollary we obtain a\ncombinatorial identity for $n^n$ involving Catalan numbers, reminiscent of a\nresult of Benjamin and Juhnke. For the case of $k = 1$ we observe that the\nnumber of elements $\\text{stan}_n^1$ is given by the determinant of the reduced\n`signless' Laplacian, which provides a weighted count for $|\\text{stan}_n^1|$\nin terms generalized spanning trees known as `spanning TU-subgraphs'.

The role of this mismatch in the\nrelaxation mechanism under the flow field is crucial for understanding the\nshear-thinning mechanism and differs between strong and fragile glass formers.\nIn fragile glass formers, shear thinning can be attributed to the shear-induced\nreduction of the {\\it effective density}. In contrast, in strong glass formers,\nthe shear-induced reduction of the {\\it effective activation energy} is a\npossible origin of a significant acceleration in relaxation.

A\nphotocathode electron gun will generate a short train of microbunches (a \"comb\"\nbeam) driven by a fiber laser system capable of producing multi micro-pulse\nlaser beam with variable separation ( \"comb\" laser pulse).

The paper\ndiscusses the process of enhancement of super-radiant emission of radiation due\nto modulation in the comb beam and the conditions required to achieve maximum\nenhancement of the radiation power. The feasibility study of generating a comb\nbeam at the photocathode and its transport through the beamline while\npreserving its temporal structure has been reported. To evaluate the\ncharacteristics of the radiation emitted from the comb beam, a C++ based\nparticle tracker and Lienard-Wiechert field solver has been developed.

The linearized Eliashberg equation is then solved for the gap\nfunction in a matrix form to resolve the role of outer CuO$_2$ planes (OPs) and\ninner plane (IP). We show that OPs dominate IP in the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave\nsuperconductivity, while IP dominates in the antiferromagnetism. This comes\nfrom an electron correlation effect in that the correlation makes the doping\nrates different between OPs and IP (i.e., a self-doping effect), which occurs\nin intermediate and strong correlation regimes. Namely, the antiferromagnetic\nfluctuations in IP are stronger due to a stronger electron correlation, which\nsimultaneously reduces the quasiparticle density of states in IP with a\nsuppressed $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave superconductivity.

In recent\nyears, because of the ever-increasing log size, data mining techniques are\noften utilized to help developers and operators conduct system reliability\nmanagement. A typical log-based system reliability management procedure is to\nfirst parse log messages because of their unstructured format; and apply data\nmining techniques on the parsed logs to obtain critical system behavior\ninformation. Most of existing research studies focus on offline log parsing,\nwhich need to parse logs in batch mode. However, software systems, especially\ndistributed systems, require online monitoring and maintenance. Thus, a log\nparser that can parse log messages in a streaming manner is highly in demand.\nTo address this problem, we propose an online log parsing method, namely Drain,\nbased on directed acyclic graph, which encodes specially designed rules for\nparsing. Drain can automatically generate a directed acyclic graph for a new\nsystem and update the graph according to the incoming log messages. Besides,\nDrain frees developers from the burden of parameter tuning by allowing them use\nDrain with no pre-defined parameters. To evaluate the performance of Drain, we\ncollect 11 log datasets generated by real-world systems, ranging from\ndistributed systems, Web applications, supercomputers, operating systems, to\nstandalone software. The experimental results show that Drain has the highest\naccuracy on all 11 datasets. Moreover, Drain obtains 37.15\\%$\\sim$ 97.14\\%\nimprovement in the running time over the state-of-the-art online parsers. We\nalso conduct a case study on a log-based anomaly detection task using Drain in\nthe parsing step, which determines its effectiveness in system reliability\nmanagement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 06:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In this\npaper, an analytical framework is provided to analyze the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability of unmanned\naerial vehicle (UAV) assisted cellular networks with clustered user equipments\n(UEs). Locations of UAVs and ground BSs are modeled as Poison point processes\n(PPPs), and UEs are assumed to be distributed according to a Poisson cluster\nprocess (PCP) around the projections of UAVs on the ground. Initially, the\ncomplementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) and probability density\nfunction (PDF) of path losses for both UAV and ground BS tiers are derived.\nSubsequently, association probabilities with each tier are obtained. SINR\ncoverage probability is derived for the entire network using tools from\nstochastic geometry. Finally, area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the entire\nnetwork is determined, and SINR coverage probability expression for a more\ngeneral model is presented by considering that UAVs are located at different\nheights. Via numerical results, we have shown that UAV height and path-loss\nexponents play important roles on the coverage performance. Moreover, coverage\nprobability can be improved with smaller number of UAVs, while better area\nspectral efficiency is achieved by employing more UAVs and having UEs more\ncompactly clustered around the UAVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Sparse coding (also called dictionary\nlearning) is an important technique in image processing, useful in inverse\nproblems, compression, and analysis; however, the usual formulation fails to\ncapture an important aspect of the structure of images: images are formed from\nbuilding blocks, e.g., edges, lines, or points, that appear at different\nlocations, orientations, and scales. The sparse coding problem can be\nreformulated to explicitly account for these transforms, at the cost of\nincreased computation. In this work, we propose an algorithm for a rotational\nversion of sparse coding that is based on K-SVD with additional rotation\noperations. We then propose a method to accelerate these rotations by learning\nthe dictionary in a steerable basis. Our experiments on patch coding and\ntexture classification demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is fast enough\nfor practical use and compares favorably to standard sparse coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:49:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 19:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

For each case, the type and\nstability of each equilibrium, Hopf bifurcation at each weak focus, and the\nnumber and distribution of limit cycles in the first quadrant are studied. It\nis shown that every equilibrium is not a center. For the case (A), $i$ limit\ncycle(s) can appear near the unique positive equilibrium, $i=1, \\cdots, 4$. For\n$i=3$ or $4$, the model has two stable limit cycles, which gives a positive\nanswer to the open problem proposed by Coleman [Differential equations\nmodel,1983]: finding at least two ecologically stable cycles in any natural (or\nlaboratory) predator-prey system.

Thus, our proposed TB model can be used for\nfurther large-scale simulations of the electronic, optical and transport\nproperties of ML-As.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 11:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

The Geant4 mass model is built as part of the ESA AREMBES project\nactivities using the BoGEMMS framework. An SPO mirror module row is the atomic\nunit of the mass model, allowing the simulation of the full structure by means\nof 20 independent runs, one for each row. Thanks to the BoGEMMS configuration\nfiles, both single pores, mirror modules or the entire SPO row can be built\nwith the same Geant4 geometry.

To mitigate the impact of power\nshortfalls, prior work has proposed to either perform power capping by\nthrottling the servers, or to leverage energy storage devices (ESDs) that can\ntemporarily provide enough power to make up for the shortfall while the fuel\ncells ramp up power generation. Both approaches have disadvantages: power\ncapping conservatively limits server performance and can lead to service level\nagreement (SLA) violations, while ESD-only solutions must significantly\noverprovision the energy storage device capacity to tolerate the shortfalls\ncaused by the worst-case (i.e., largest) power surges, which greatly increases\nthe total cost of ownership (TCO).\n  We propose SizeCap, the first ESD sizing framework for fuel cell powered data\ncenters, which coordinates ESD sizing with power capping to enable a\ncost-effective solution to power shortfalls in data centers. SizeCap sizes the\nESD just large enough to cover the majority of power surges, but not the\nworst-case surges that occur infrequently, to greatly reduce TCO. It then uses\nthe smaller capacity ESD in conjunction with power capping to cover the power\nshortfalls caused by the worst-case power surges. As part of our new flexible\nframework, we propose multiple power capping policies with different degrees of\nawareness of fuel cell and workload behavior, and evaluate their impact on\nworkload performance and ESD size. Using traces from Microsoft's production\ndata center systems, we demonstrate that SizeCap significantly reduces the ESD\nsize without violating any SLAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 13:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

However, its supremacy may be\nattributed to being able to use specific distances for time series within the\nclassification process and not to the classifier itself. With the aim of\nexploiting these distances within more complex classifiers, new approaches have\narisen in the past few years that are competitive or which outperform the 1-NN\nbased approaches. In some cases, these new methods use the distance measure to\ntransform the series into feature vectors, bridging the gap between time series\nand traditional classifiers. In other cases, the distances are employed to\nobtain a time series kernel and enable the use of kernel methods for time\nseries classification.

We show that, in uniformly generated\n$\\gamma$-structures, there is a significant gap in this length-spectrum, i.e.,\nthere asymptotically almost surely exists a unique longest block of length at\nleast $n-O(n^{1/2})$ and that with high probability any other block has finite\nlength. For fixed $\\gamma$, we prove that the length of the longest block\nconverges to a discrete limit law, and that the distribution of short blocks of\ngiven length tends to a negative binomial distribution in the limit of long\nsequences. We refine this analysis to the length spectrum of blocks of specific\npseudoknot types, such as H-type and kissing hairpins. Our results generalize\nthe rainbow spectrum on secondary structures by the first and third authors and\nare being put into context with the structural prediction of long non-coding\nRNAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 13:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

The work presented in this paper aims to tackle this\nproblem by addressing two challenges: (i) the definition of a suitable\nsimilarity metric and (ii) the determination of a suitable optimization\nstrategy.\n  Methods: This work proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network to\nlearn a similarity metric for MR-TRUS registration. We also use a composite\noptimization strategy that explores the solution space in order to search for a\nsuitable initialization for the second-order optimization of the learned\nmetric. Further, a multi-pass approach is used in order to smooth the metric\nfor optimization.\n  Results: The learned similarity metric outperforms the classical mutual\ninformation and also the state-of-the-art MIND feature based methods. The\nresults indicate that the overall registration framework has a large capture\nrange. The proposed deep similarity metric based approach obtained a mean TRE\nof 3.86mm (with an initial TRE of 16mm) for this challenging problem.\n  Conclusion: A similarity metric that is learned using a deep neural network\ncan be used to assess the quality of any given image registration and can be\nused in conjunction with the aforementioned optimization framework to perform\nautomatic registration that is robust to poor initialization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 14:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 13:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

Therefore, the\nabundance and properties of APs affect the resilience of the network to these\ncollapse scenarios. We present analytical results for the statistical\nproperties of APs in configuration model networks. In order to quantify their\nabundance, we calculate the probability $P(i \\in {\\rm AP})$, that a random\nnode, i, in a configuration model network with P(K=k), is an AP. We also obtain\nthe conditional probability $P(i \\in {\\rm AP}|k)$ that a random node of degree\nk is an AP, and find that high degree nodes are more likely to be APs than low\ndegree nodes. Using Bayes' theorem, we obtain the conditional degree\ndistribution, $P(K=k|{\\rm AP})$, over the set of APs and compare it to P(K=k).\nWe propose a new centrality measure based on APs: each node can be\ncharacterized by its articulation rank, r, which is the number of components\nthat would be added to the network upon deletion of that node.

It was recently proved by Guo and Jerrum (2017) that the\nSwendsen-Wang dynamics has polynomial mixing time on any graph at all\ntemperatures, yet there are few results providing $o(|V|)$ upper bounds on its\nconvergence time.\n  We prove fast convergence of the Swendsen-Wang dynamics on general graphs in\nthe tree uniqueness region of the ferromagnetic Ising model. In particular,\nwhen $\\beta < \\beta_c(d)$ where $\\beta_c(d)$ denotes the\nuniqueness/non-uniqueness threshold on infinite $d$-regular trees, we prove\nthat the relaxation time (i.e., the inverse spectral gap) of the Swendsen-Wang\ndynamics is $\\Theta(1)$ on any graph of maximum degree $d \\geq 3$.

This review chapter focuses on high resolution spectroscopy\n(HRS; R=25,000-100,000), which helps to disentangle and isolate the exoplanet's\nspectrum. At high spectral resolution, molecular features are resolved into a\ndense forest of individual lines in a pattern that is unique for a given\nmolecule. For close-in planets, the spectral lines undergo large Doppler shifts\nduring the planet's orbit, while the host star and Earth's spectral features\nremain essentially stationary, enabling a velocity separation of the planet.\nFor slower-moving, wide-orbit planets, HRS aided by high contrast imaging\ninstead isolates their spectra using their spatial separation. The lines in the\nexoplanet spectrum are detected by comparing them with high resolution spectra\nfrom atmospheric modelling codes; essentially a form of fingerprinting for\nexoplanet atmospheres. This measures the planet's orbital velocity, and helps\ndefine its true mass and orbital inclination. Consequently, HRS can detect both\ntransiting and non-transiting planets. It also simultaneously characterizes the\nplanet's atmosphere due to its sensitivity to the depth, shape, and position of\nthe planet's spectral lines.

In addition, the radio pulsations\ndisappeared after the X-ray bursts and reappeared about two weeks later with\nthe flux density at 1.4\\,GHz increased by a factor of five. The flux density\nthen decreased and undershot the normal flux density followed by a slow\nrecovery back to normal. The pulsar's integrated profile underwent dramatic and\nshort-term changes in total intensity, polarization and position angle. Despite\nthe complex evolution, we observe correlations between the spin-down rate,\npulse profile shape and radio flux density. Strong single pulses have been\ndetected after the X-ray bursts with their energy distributions evolving with\ntime. The peculiar but smooth spin frequency evolution of PSR~J1119$-$6127\naccompanied by systematic pulse profile and flux density changes are most\nlikely to be a result of either reconfiguration of the surface magnetic fields\nor particle winds triggered by the X-ray bursts. The recovery of spin-down rate\nand pulse profile to normal provides us the best case to study the connection\nbetween high magnetic-field pulsars and magnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 09:41:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 23:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The experimentation is carried out\nusing a new one-sided classification toolkit that was designed and developed\nfrom the ground up. In the one-sided classification paradigm, the objective is\nto separate elements of the target class from all outliers. These one-sided\nclassifiers are generally chosen, in practice, when there is a deficiency of\nsome sort in the training examples. Sometimes outlier examples can be rare,\nexpensive to label, or even entirely absent. However, this author would like to\nnote that they can be equally applicable when outlier examples are plentiful\nbut nonetheless not statistically representative of the complete outlier\nconcept. It is this scenario that is explicitly dealt with in this research\nwork. In these circumstances, one-sided classifiers have been found to be more\nrobust that conventional multi-class classifiers. The term \"unexpected\"\noutliers is introduced to represent outlier examples, encountered in the test\nset, that have been taken from a different distribution to the training set\nexamples. These are examples that are a result of an inadequate representation\nof all possible outliers in the training set. It can often be impossible to\nfully characterise outlier examples given the fact that they can represent the\nimmeasurable quantity of \"everything else\" that is not a target. The findings\nfrom this research have shown the potential drawbacks of using conventional\nmulti-class classification algorithms when the test data come from a completely\ndifferent distribution to that of the training samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 14:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

A\nnovel distributed peer review (DPR) approach has recently been proposed to\naddress these issues. The new approach assigns principal investigators (PIs)\nwho submitted proposals (or papers) to the same program as reviewers. Each PI\nreviews and ranks a small number (such as seven) of other PIs' proposals. The\nindividual rankings are then used to estimate a global ranking of all proposals\nusing the Modified Borda Count (MBC). In this study, we perform simulation\nstudies to investigate several parameters important for the decision making\nwhen adopting this new approach. We also propose a new method called\nConcordance Index-based Global Ranking (CIGR) to estimate global ranking from\nindividual rankings. An efficient simulated annealing algorithm is designed to\nsearch the optimal Concordance Index (CI). Moreover, we design a new balanced\nreview assignment procedure, which can result in significantly better\nperformance for both MBC and CIGR methods. We found that CIGR performs better\nthan MBC when the review quality is relatively high. As review quality and\nreview difficulty are tightly correlated, we constructed a boundary in the\nspace of review quality vs review difficulty that separates the CIGR-superior\nand MBC-superior regions. Finally, we propose a multi-stage DPR strategy based\non CIGR, which has the potential to substantially improve the overall review\nperformance while reducing the review workload.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 23:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 18:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 18:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

We refer to this offspring of BNF as Math-BNF or MBNF, to\nthe original BNF and its notational variants just as BNF, and to aspects common\nto both as BNF-style. What all BNF-style notations share is the use of\nproduction rules roughly of this form: $$\\bullet \\mathrel{::=} \\circ_1 \\mid\n\\cdots \\mid \\circ_n $$ Normally, such a rule says \"every instance of $\\circ_i$\nfor $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ is also an in stance of $\\bullet$\". MBNF is\ndistinct from BNF in the entities and operations it allows. Instead of strings,\nMBNF builds arrangements of symbols that we call math-text. Sometimes \"syntax\"\nis defined by interleaving MBNF production rules and other mathematical\ndefinitions that can contain chunks of math-text. There is no clear definition\nof MBNF. Readers do not have a document which tells them how MBNF is to be read\nand must learn MBNF through a process of cultural initiation. To the extent\nthat MBNF is defined, it is largely through examples scattered throughout the\nliterature and which require readers to guess the mathematical structures\nunderpinning them. This paper gives MBNF examples illustrating some of the\ndifferences between MBNF and BNF. We propose a definition of syntactic math\ntext (SMT) which handles many (but far from all) uses of math-text and MBNF in\nthe wild. We aim to balance the goal of being accessible and not requiring too\nmuch prerequisite knowledge with the conflicting goal of providing a rich\nmathematical structure that already supports many uses and has possibilities to\nbe extended to support more challenging cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 13:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

The system was validated on\nepoxy resin/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes and found extremely\ninformative for the understanding of the flame retardancy mechanisms of POSS,\npreviously referred to as the blowing-out effect. Collected products were\nanalyzed by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, to\nidentify the gaseous and liquid decomposition products, allowing to depict a\ncomprehensive decomposition pathway for the epoxy resin. Lightweight volatiles,\ngaseous at room temperature, showed limited differences as a function of\nDOPO-POSS, whereas mixtures of liquid products evidenced for dramatic changes\nin the relative concentration as a function of DOPO-POSS. In pristine epoxy\nresin, the most abundant products were recognized as benzene, phenol,\nnaphthalene and toluene, along with several tens of other aromatic products\nobserved in lower amounts. The presence of DOPO-POSS at low concentration\nradically changes the composition of the aromatic volatiles mixture, as no\nsignificant amount of benzene is produced, while phenol becomes the main\nproduct, accounting for about half of the total, isopropyl phenol and bisphenol\nA, along with several tens of other products in lower concentrations. Such\nmodification of the fuel mixture feeding the flame provided an explanation for\nthe lower flammability of this formulation, as well as for the phenomenology of\nthe blowing out effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 22:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

However, computing platforms, where the actual hardware\ncharacteristics are hidden from both the end user and the tools that mediate\nexecution, such as a compiler, a JIT and a runtime system, are used more and\nmore, for example, performing large scale computation in cloud and cluster.\nEven worse, in such environments, a single computation may use a collection of\nprocessors with dissimilar characteristics. Ignorance of the\nperformance-critical parameters of the underlying system makes it difficult to\nimprove performance by optimizing the code or adjusting runtime-system\nbehaviors; it also makes application performance harder to understand.\n  To address this problem, we have developed a suite of portable tools that can\nefficiently derive many of the parameters of processor memory hierarchies, such\nas levels, effective capacity and latency of caches and TLBs, in a matter of\nseconds. The tools use a series of carefully considered experiments to produce\nand analyze cache response curves automatically.

Contemporary IoT deployments widely\nuse the publish-subscribe messaging model because of its resource-efficiency.\nHowever, the systems with publish-subscribe messaging model employ a\ncentralized architecture, wherein the data from all the devices in the\napplication network flows via a central broker to the subscribers. Such a\ncentralized architecture make publish-subscribe messaging model susceptible to\na central point of failure. Besides, it provides an opportunity for the\norganization that owns the broker to tamper with the data. In this work, we\ncontribute Trinity, a novel distributed publish-subscribe broker with\nblockchain-based immutability. Trinity distributes the data published to one of\nthe brokers in the network to all the brokers in the network. The distributed\ndata is stored in an immutable ledger through the use of the blockchain\ntechnology. Furthermore, Trinity executes smart contracts to validate the data\nbefore saving the data on the blockchain. Through the use of a blockchain\nnetwork, Trinity can guarantee persistence, ordering, and immutability across\ntrust boundaries. Our evaluation results show that Trinity consumes minimal\nresources, and the use of smart contracts enable the stakeholders to automate\nthe data management processes. To the best of our knowledge, Trinity is the\nfirst framework that combines the components of the blockchain technology with\nthe publish-subscribe messaging model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 13:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

At IAU resolution B5, item b, that shape serves as an indicator\nfor a distinct mechanism of its forming, caused by a minimum of mass. Rigid\nbody forces should have been overcome by self gravity and a hydrostatic\nequilibrium shape should have been achieved. A new approach to correlate the\nsize and shape of a solid in hydrostatic equilibrium by balancing self gravity\nand rigid body forces leads to a real, not to an arbitrary lower limit of size.\nNo arbitrary criterion is required as it is often the case. Above this limit\nthe shape of a solid body is restricted by a maximum of its surface area, and\nthis maximum vanishes only at infinite size. Therefore the shape like that of a\nrelated fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium can only be reached in the solid\nstate, if its surface area is larger than this maximum. This applies only to\nthe four giant planets and Haumea. All the known nearly round celestial bodies\nin the solar System cant have achieved their present shape while being solids.\nThe dwarf Haumea is a questionable exception. The present shapes have been\nformed before solidification and are frozen. The gas giants are not solids at\nall and the terrestrial planets have at least partially melted in their thermal\nhistory for millions of years. The smaller nearly round objects such as\nasteroids and satellites were at least partially melted combined with internal\ndifferentiation and resurfacing of a mechanically unstable crust in their very\nearly thermal history. No rigid body forces had to be overcome. Item b of the\ncurrent planet definition is somewhat undetermined. All planets and dwarfs in\nthe solar system match this requirement only at very generous interpretation.\nIt should be completely deleted. The number of dwarfs could be restricted by an\narbitrary minimum of mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 10:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}
