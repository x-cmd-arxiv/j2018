The rodlike counterions are assumed to have an internal\ncharge distribution, specified by a multivalent monopolar moment and a finite\nquadrupolar moment, and the quenched surface charge is assumed to be randomly\ndistributed with equal mean and variance on the two surfaces. While equally\ncharged surfaces are known to repel within the traditional mean-field theories,\nthe presence of multivalent counterions has been shown to cause attractive\ninteractions between uniformly charged surfaces due to the prevalence of strong\nelectrostatic couplings that grow rapidly with the counterion valency. We show\nthat the combined effects due to electrostatic correlations (caused by the\ncoupling between the mean surface field and the multivalent, monopolar, charge\nvalency of counterions) as well as the disorder-induced interactions (caused by\nthe coupling between the surface disorder field and the quadrupolar moment of\ncounterions) lead to much stronger attractive interactions between two randomly\ncharged surfaces. The interaction profile turns out to be a nonmonotonic\nfunction of the intersurface separation, displaying an attractive minimum at\nrelatively small separations, where the ensuing attraction can exceed the\nmaximum strong-coupling attraction (produced by multivalent monopolar\ncounterions between uniformly charged surfaces) by more than an order of\nmagnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 16:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 04:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

By further equating the speed of the reference frame with the\nspeed of such a wave, we reduce the Enskog-Navier-Stokes equations into a more\nsimple system of two ordinary differential equations, whose solutions depend on\na single scalar spatial variable. We then observe that this system has two\nfixed points, which are taken to be the states of the gas before and after the\nshock, and compute the corresponding shock transition in the form of the\nheteroclinic orbit connecting these two states. We find that the Enskog\ncorrection affects both the difference between the fixed points, and the\nthickness of the transition.

Dyna is a planning paradigm that naturally interleaves learning and\nplanning, by simulating one-step experience to update the action-value\nfunction. This elegant planning strategy has been mostly explored in the\ntabular setting. The aim of this paper is to revisit sample-based planning, in\nstochastic and continuous domains with learned models. We first highlight the\nflexibility afforded by a model over Experience Replay (ER). Replay-based\nmethods can be seen as stochastic planning methods that repeatedly sample from\na buffer of recent agent-environment interactions and perform updates to\nimprove data efficiency. We show that a model, as opposed to a replay buffer,\nis particularly useful for specifying which states to sample from during\nplanning, such as predecessor states that propagate information in reverse from\na state more quickly. We introduce a semi-parametric model learning approach,\ncalled Reweighted Experience Models (REMs), that makes it simple to sample next\nstates or predecessors. We demonstrate that REM-Dyna exhibits similar\nadvantages over replay-based methods in learning in continuous state problems,\nand that the performance gap grows when moving to stochastic domains, of\nincreasing size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 16:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms\nacquire reinforcement learning procedures to solve new problems more\nefficiently by utilizing experience from prior tasks. The performance of\nmeta-learning algorithms depends on the tasks available for meta-training: in\nthe same way that supervised learning generalizes best to test points drawn\nfrom the same distribution as the training points, meta-learning methods\ngeneralize best to tasks from the same distribution as the meta-training tasks.\nIn effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the design burden from\nalgorithm design to task design. If we can automate the process of task design\nas well, we can devise a meta-learning algorithm that is truly automated. In\nthis work, we take a step in this direction, proposing a family of unsupervised\nmeta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We motivate and describe a\ngeneral recipe for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, and present an\ninstantiation of this approach. Our conceptual and theoretical contributions\nconsist of formulating the unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning problem and\ndescribing how task proposals based on mutual information can be used to train\noptimal meta-learners.

One may ask whether $w$ occurs\nin $t$, and if so, where? More generally, we may have a set $P$ of patterns and\na set $T$ of texts, where $P$ and $T$ are regular languages. We are interested\nwhether any word of $T$ begins with a word of $P$, ends with a word of $P$, has\na word of $P$ as a factor, or has a word of $P$ as a subsequence.

To supplement non-discriminative regions,\nsaliency maps are then considered under Bayesian framework to refine the object\nregions. Then in the top-down step, the refined object regions are used as\nsupervision to train the segmentation network and to predict object masks.\nThese object masks provide more accurate localization and contain more regions\nof object. Further, we take these object masks as initial localization and mine\ncommon object features from them. These processes are conducted iteratively to\nprogressively produce fine object masks and optimize segmentation networks.\nExperimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 17:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Here we\nreport the first detection of linear polarization of the supernova's\nsynchrotron emission from imaging observations at frequencies spanning from 20\nto 50 GHz, carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact Array between\nOctober 2015 and May 2016. The direction of the radio polarization, corrected\nfor Faraday rotation, points to a primarily radial magnetic field across the\ninner ring, encompassing both the reverse and forward shocks. The magnetic\nfield strength peaks over the high-emissivity eastern sites, where efficient\ncosmic ray acceleration likely takes place under quasi-parallel shocks at high\nMach numbers. The mean fraction of polarized emission in the brightest sites is\n$2.7\\pm0.2\\%$ at 22 GHz and $3.5\\pm0.7\\%$ at 44 GHz. In the inner remnant,\nnon-radial components of the polarized emission appear to be more prevalent.\nHowever, the low significance detection in the central regions limits\ninterpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 20:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

The objective is to minimize the sum of the assigned\npowers.\n  MSPEC is a graph generalization of a barrier coverage problem in a wireless\nsensor network: given a set of unit disks with centers in a rectangle, what is\nthe minimum total amount by which we must shrink the disks to permit an\nintruder to cross the rectangle undetected, i.e. without entering any disc.\nThis is a more sophisticated measure of barrier coverage than the minimum\nnumber of disks whose removal breaks the barrier.\n  We develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for MSPEC.

This has sparked a line of research into\nalgorithms that can recover from a system crash. Since caches are expected to\nremain volatile, concurrent data structures and algorithms must be redesigned\nto guarantee that they are left in a consistent state after a system crash, and\nthat the execution can be continued upon recovery. However, the prospect of\nredesigning every concurrent data structure or algorithm before it can be used\nin NVM architectures is daunting.\n  In this paper, we present a construction that takes any concurrent program\nwith reads, writes and CASs to shared memory and makes it persistent, i.e., can\nbe continued after one or more processes fault and have to restart. Importantly\nthe converted algorithm has constant computational delay (preserves instruction\ncounts on each process within a constant factor), as well as constant recovery\ndelay (a process can recover from a fault in a constant number of\ninstructions). We show this first for a simple transformation, and then present\noptimizations to make it more practical, allowing for a tradeoff for better\nconstant factors in computational delay, for sometimes increased recovery\ndelay. We also provide an optimized transformation that works for any\nnormalized lock-free data structure, thus allowing more efficient constructions\nfor a large class of concurrent algorithms. We experimentally evaluate our\ntransformations by applying them to a queue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 21:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 22:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 21:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-22"}

In order\nto extend such an enhancement to metrology experiments based on atomic\nensembles, an efficient light-atom interaction is required. Thus, there is a\nparticular interest in generating narrow-band squeezed light that is on atomic\nresonance. This will make it possible not only to enhance the sensitivity of\natomic based sensors, but also to deterministically entangle two distant atomic\nensembles. We generate bright two-mode squeezed states of light, or twin beams,\nwith a non-degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) process in hot $^{85}$Rb in a\ndouble-lambda configuration. Given the proximity of the energy levels in the D1\nline of $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb, we are able to operate the FWM in $^{85}$Rb in\na regime that generates two-mode squeezed states in which both modes are\nsimultaneously on resonance with transitions in the D1 line of $^{87}$Rb, one\nmode with the $F=2$ to $F'=2$ transition and the other one with the $F=1$ to\n$F'=1$ transition.

Moreover, the intensity difference squeezing\nincreases to $-5.4$ dB and $-5.0$ dB when only one of the modes of the squeezed\nstate is resonant with the D1 $F=2$ to $F'=2$ or $F=1$ to $F'=1$ transition of\n$^{87}$Rb, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 23:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

The leading-twist\ntime-reversal even transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function\n(TMD) of the pion is then directly obtained from these LFWFs. A key\ncharacteristic of the LFWFs, which is driven by dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking, is that at typical hadronic scales they are broad functions in the\nlight-cone momentum fraction $x$. The LFWFs have a non-trivial $(x,k_T^2)$\ndependence and in general do not factorize into separate functions of each\nvariable. The $l_z=0$ LFWF is concave with a maximum at $x=1/2$, whereas\norbital angular momentum effects causes the $|l_z|=1$ LFWF to have a slight\n{\\it double-humped} structure for quark transverse momentum in the range $0.5\n\\lesssim k_T^2 \\lesssim 5\\,$GeV$^2$.

We study a problem with related\napplications in domains cited above that have recently met with substantial\nrecent press: sampling.\n  Keeping correct utility levels in such a strong model of statistical\nindistinguishability looks difficult to be achieved with the usual differential\nprivacy toolbox because it would typically scale in the worst case the\nsensitivity by the sample size and so the noise variance by up to its square.\nWe introduce a trick specific to sampling that bypasses the sensitivity\nanalysis. Privacy enforces an information theoretic barrier on approximation,\nand we show how to reach this barrier with guarantees on the approximation of\nthe target non private density. We do so using a recent approach to non private\ndensity estimation relying on the original boosting theory, learning the\nsufficient statistics of an exponential family with classifiers.

In the context of learning, the\nsampling problem is particularly important: because integral privacy enjoys the\nsame closure under post-processing as differential privacy does, any algorithm\nusing integrally privacy sampled data would result in an output equally\nintegrally private. We also show that this brings fairness guarantees on\npost-processing that would eventually elude classical differential privacy: any\ndecision process has bounded data-dependent bias when the data is integrally\nprivately sampled.

Using numerical simulations of this new \"GC-GMC\" collision\nscenario we demonstrate that, within a time frame of several Gyrs, our\nsynthetic Ter 5 was capable of interacting with a metal-rich GMC in the central\nregion of the Galaxy. As a consequence of this, our simulated globular cluster\n(GC) is able to capture enough gas from the colliding GMC to form a new\npopulation of metal-rich stars.

A chemical link between Ter 5 and the bulge population of\nthe Milky Way has long been observed and these simulations finally provide\nevidence for their similarities.

The emission measure varies by an order of magnitude and marginally\ncorrelates with the Galactic latitude. Despite the large scatter of the data,\nthe emission measure distribution is roughly reproduced by a disk-like density\ndistribution with a scale length of $\\sim7$ kpc, a scale height of $\\sim2$ kpc,\nand a total mass of $\\sim5\\times10^7$ $M_{\\odot}$. In addition, we found that a\nspherical hot gas with the $\\beta$-model profile hardly contributes to the\nobserved X-rays but that its total mass might reach $\\gtrsim10^9$ $M_{\\odot}$.\nCombined with indirect evidence of an extended gaseous halo from other\nobservations, the hot gaseous halo likely consists of a dense disk-like\ncomponent and a rarefied spherical component; the X-ray emissions primarily\ncome from the former but the mass is dominated by the latter. The disk-like\ncomponent likely originates from stellar feedback in the Galactic disk due to\nthe low scale height and the large scatter of the emission measures. The median\n[O/Fe] of $\\sim0.25$ shows the contribution of the core-collapse supernovae and\nsupports the stellar feedback origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 03:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Although in such cases the pAUC has been\nutilized as a performance measure, few methods have been proposed for directly\nmaximizing the pAUC. This optimization is achieved by using a scoring function.\nThe conventional approach utilizes a linear function as the scoring function.\nIn contrast we newly introduce nonlinear scoring functions for this purpose.\nSpecifically, we present two types of nonlinear scoring functions based on\ngenerative models and deep neural networks.

Herein, we show how sub-wavelength facets of an organic\nmolecular mesowire crystal can be utilized to systematically vary the\ndirectionality of second harmonic generation (SHG) in the forward scattering\ngeometry. We demonstrate this capability on crystalline diamonoanthraquinone\n(DAAQ) mesowires with subwavelength facets. We observed that the radial angles\nof the SHG emission can be tuned over a range of 130 degrees. This angular\nvariation arises due to spatially distributed nonlinear dipoles in the focal\nvolume of the excitation as well as the geometrical cross-section and facet\norientation of the mesowire. Numerical simulations of the near-field excitation\nprofile corroborate the role of the mesowire geometry in localizing the\nelectric field. In addition to directional SHG from the mesowire, we\nexperimentally observe optical waveguiding of the nonlinear two-photon excited\nfluorescence (TPEF). Interestingly, we observed that for a given pump\nexcitation, the TPEF signal is isotropic and delocalized, whereas the SHG\nemission is directional and localized at the location of excitation. All the\nobserved effects have direct implications not only in active nonlinear optical\nantennas, but also in nonlinear signal processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

We analyze the properties of our measurement matrix using\nrestricted isometry property, the associated coherence and phase transition.\nThrough extensive simulations on practical data, we show that the measurement\nmatrix can reconstruct data with high fidelity.

A simple mechanism for driving such\noutflows involves X-ray heating of the top of the disc atmosphere to the\nCompton temperature. Beyond the Compton radius, the thermal speed exceeds the\nescape velocity, and mass loss is inevitable. Here, we present the first\ncoupled radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of such thermally-driven disc winds.\nThe main advance over previous modelling efforts is that the\nfrequency-dependent attenuation of the irradiating SED is taken into account.\nWe can therefore relax the approximation that the wind is optically thin\nthroughout which is unlikely to hold in the crucial acceleration zone of the\nflow. The main remaining limitations of our simulations are connected to our\ntreatment of optically thick regions. Adopting parameters representative of the\nwind-driving LMXB GRO~J1655-40, our radiation-hydrodynamic model yields a\nmass-loss rate that is $\\simeq5\\times$ lower than that suggested by pure\nhydrodynamic, optically thin models. This outflow rate still represents more\nthan twice the accretion rate and agrees well with the mass-loss rate inferred\nfrom Chandra/HETG observations of GRO~J1655-40 at a time when the system had a\nsimilar luminosity to that adopted in our simulations. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI\nLyman $\\rm{\\alpha}~$ absorption line profiles observed in this state are\nslightly stronger than those predicted by our simulations but the qualitative\nagreement between observed and simulated outflow properties means that thermal\ndriving is a viable mechanism for powering the disc winds seen in soft-state\nLMXBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 08:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

As remarkably different value of\nlong-range-correlation indicates phase-transition, similar change in the\nfluctuation pattern in terms of these parameters can be attributed to a\nphase-transition and also the onset of QGP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 09:12:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 07:06:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 10:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

A beam splitting technique is designed to generate multiple analog\nbeams to serve multiple users for NOMA transmission. Compared to conventional\nmmWave orthogonal multiple access (mmWave-OMA) schemes, the proposed scheme can\nserve more than one user on each radio frequency (RF) chain. Besides, in\ncontrast to the recently proposed single-beam mmWave-NOMA scheme which can only\nserve multiple NOMA users within the same beam, the proposed scheme can perform\nNOMA transmission for the users with an arbitrary angle-of-departure (AOD)\ndistribution. This provides a higher flexibility for applying NOMA in mmWave\ncommunications and thus can efficiently exploit the potential multi-user\ndiversity. Then, we design a suboptimal two-stage resource allocation for\nmaximizing the system sum-rate. In the first stage, assuming that only analog\nbeamforming is available, a user grouping and antenna allocation algorithm is\nproposed to maximize the conditional system sum-rate based on the coalition\nformation game theory.

A\ndetailed linear stability analysis demonstrates that a non-zero system delay\nacts destabilizing on the otherwise stable fixed point for sufficiently large\nfeedback strengths. The imaginary part of the dominant eigenvalue is bounded by\ntwice the feedback strength. In the relevant parameter space it changes\ndiscontinuously along specific lines when switching between branches of\neigenvalues.

Despite massive changes in visual content\nacross cuts, viewers in general experience no trouble perceiving the\ndiscontinuous flow of information as a coherent set of events. However, Virtual\nReality (VR) movies are intrinsically different from traditional movies in that\nthe viewer controls the camera orientation at all times. As a consequence,\ncommon editing techniques that rely on camera orientations, zooms, etc., cannot\nbe used. In this paper we investigate key relevant questions to understand how\nwell traditional movie editing carries over to VR. To do so, we rely on recent\ncognition studies and the event segmentation theory, which states that our\nbrains segment continuous actions into a series of discrete, meaningful events.\nWe first replicate one of these studies to assess whether the predictions of\nsuch theory can be applied to VR. We next gather gaze data from viewers\nwatching VR videos containing different edits with varying parameters, and\nprovide the first systematic analysis of viewers' behavior and the perception\nof continuity in VR. From this analysis we make a series of relevant findings;\nfor instance, our data suggests that predictions from the cognitive event\nsegmentation theory are useful guides for VR editing; that different types of\nedits are equally well understood in terms of continuity; and that spatial\nmisalignments between regions of interest at the edit boundaries favor a more\nexploratory behavior even after viewers have fixated on a new region of\ninterest. In addition, we propose a number of metrics to describe viewers'\nattentional behavior in VR. We believe the insights derived from our work can\nbe useful as guidelines for VR content creation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 10:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-14"}

Here we show, using the\nrecent Gaia data release 2 (DR2), that these extremely low disk fractions are\nactually due to a very high contamination by background giants. Out of the 83\ncandidate young stellar objects (YSOs) in these clouds observed by Gaia, only\nfive have distances of 150 pc, similar to YSOs in the other Lupus clouds, and\nhave similar proper motions to other members in this star-forming complex.

In\nthis paper, we present an intuitive control space for predictable editing of\ncaptured BRDF data, which allows for artistic creation of plausible novel\nmaterial appearances, bypassing the difficulty of acquiring novel samples. We\nfirst synthesize novel materials, extending the existing MERL dataset up to 400\nmathematically valid BRDFs.

We\nshow that our functionals are excellent predictors of the perceived attributes\nof appearance. Our control space enables many applications, including intuitive\nmaterial editing of a wide range of visual properties, guidance for gamut\nmapping, analysis of the correlation between perceptual attributes, or novel\nappearance similarity metrics. Moreover, our methodology can be used to derive\nfunctionals applicable to classic analytic BRDF representations.

These active fluctuations do not fulfill a fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation and therefore play the role of a non-equilibrium environment, which\nkeeps the system permanently out of thermal equilibrium even in the absence of\nexternal forces. We investigate how the out-of-equilibrium character of the\nactive matter system and the associated irreversibility is reflected in the\ntrajectories of the Brownian particle. Specifically, we analyze the log-ratio\nof path probabilities for observing a certain particle trajectory forward in\ntime versus observing its time-reversed twin trajectory. For passive Brownian\nmotion, it is well-known that this path probability ratio quantifies\nirreversibility in terms of entropy production. For active Brownian motion, we\nshow that in addition to the usual entropy produced in the thermal environment\nthe path probability ratio contains a contribution to irreversibility from\nmutual information production between the particle trajectory and the history\nof the non-equilibrium environment. The resulting irreversibility measure\nfulfills an integral fluctuation theorem and a second-law like relation. When\nderiving and discussing these relations, we keep in mind that the active\nfluctuations can occur either due to a suspension of active particles pushing\naround a passive colloid or due to active self-propulsion of the particle\nitself; we point out the similarities and differences between these two\nsituations.

Our proposed family of measures corresponds to the\nlong-established formulations of cardinal social welfare in economics, and is\njustified by the Rawlsian conception of fairness behind a veil of ignorance.\nThe convex formulation of our welfare-based measures of fairness allows us to\nintegrate them as a constraint into any convex loss minimization pipeline. Our\nempirical analysis reveals interesting trade-offs between our proposal and (a)\nprediction accuracy, (b) group discrimination, and (c) Dwork et al.'s notion of\nindividual fairness. Furthermore and perhaps most importantly, our work\nprovides both heuristic justification and empirical evidence suggesting that a\nlower-bound on our measures often leads to bounded inequality in algorithmic\noutcomes; hence presenting the first computationally feasible mechanism for\nbounding individual-level inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 11:36:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 09:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 13:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 11:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

The employed physical model is a two-phase model\nderived from the Baer-Nunziato system for compressible multi-phase flows. In\nparticular, as proposed for the first time in Dumbser (2011), the number of\nequations is reduced from seven to three by assuming that the relative pressure\nof the gas with respect to the atmospheric reference pressure is zero, and that\nthe gas momentum is negligible compared to the one of the liquid. The two-phase\nmodel does not make any of the classical assumptions of shallow water type\nsystems, hence it does not neglect vertical accelerations and the free surface\nis not constraint to be a single-valued function, so even complex shapes as\nthose of breaking waves can be properly captured. The resulting PDE system is\nsolved by a novel well balanced path-conservative finite volume method on\nstructured Cartesian grids, which is able to preserve exactly the equilibrium\nstates even in the presence of obstacles. It furthermore automatically computes\nthe location of the water-air interfaces, and assures low numerical dissipation\nat the free surface thanks to a novel Osher-Romberg-type Riemann solver.\nFinally, high computational performance is guaranteed by an efficient parallel\nimplementation on a GPU-based platform that reaches the efficiency of twenty\nmillion of volumes processed per seconds and makes it possible to employ even\nvery fine meshes. The validation of our new well balanced scheme is carried out\nby comparing the obtained numerical results against existing analytical,\nnumerical and experimental reference solutions for a large number of test\ncases, among which oscillating elliptical drops, dambreak problems, breaking\nwaves, over topping weir flows, and wave impact problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 11:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 13:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

The precise\ndetermination of their critical exponents defines a prime benchmark for\ncomplementary theoretical approaches, such as lattice simulations, the\nrenormalization group and the conformal bootstrap. Despite promising recent\ndevelopments in each of these methods, however, no satisfactory consensus on\nthe fermionic critical exponents has been achieved, so far. Here, we perform a\ncomprehensive analysis of the Ising Gross-Neveu universality classes based on\nthe recently achieved four-loop perturbative calculations. We combine the\nperturbative series in $4-\\epsilon$ spacetime dimensions with the one for the\npurely fermionic Gross-Neveu model in $2+\\epsilon$ dimensions by employing\npolynomial interpolation as well as two-sided Pad\\'e approximants. Further, we\nprovide predictions for the critical exponents exploring various resummation\ntechniques following the strategies developed for the three-dimensional scalar\n$O(n)$ universality classes. We give an exhaustive appraisal of the current\nsituation of Gross-Neveu universality by comparison to other methods. For large\nenough number of spinor components $N\\geq 8$ as well as for the case of\nemergent supersymmetry $N=1$, we find our renormalization group estimates to be\nin excellent agreement with the conformal bootstrap, building a strong case for\nthe validity of these values.

The sample stars are: R Aqr, Mira, W Aql, and pi1 Gru. The\nsample covers a range in binary separation and wind properties, where R Aqr is\nthe source with the smallest separation. The R Aqr binary pair consists of an\nM-type AGB star and a white dwarf at a separation of 45 mas, equivalent to\nabout 10 AU at 218 pc. The aim of the ALMA study is to investigate the\ndependence of the wind shaping on the binary separation and to provide\nconstraints for hydrodynamical binary interaction models. R Aqr is particularly\ninteresting as the source with the smallest separation and a complex\ncircumstellar environment that is strongly affected by the interaction between\nthe two stars and by the high-energy radiation resulting from this interaction\nand from the hot white dwarf companion. The CO(J=3-2) line emission has been\nobserved at 0.5\" spatial resolution. The CO envelope around the binary pair is\nmarginally resolved, showing what appears to be a rather complex distribution.\nThe outer radius of the CO emitting region is estimated from the data and found\nto be about a factor of 10 larger than previously thought. This implies an\naverage mass-loss rate during the past 100 yr of 2x10-7 Msun/yr, a factor of 45\nless than previous estimates. The channel maps are presented and the molecular\ngas distribution is discussed and set into the context of what was previously\nknown about the system. Additional molecular line emission detected within the\nbandwidth covered by the ALMA observations is also presented. Because of the\nlimited extent of the emission, firm conclusions about the dynamical evolution\nof the system will have to wait for higher spatial resolution observations.\nHowever, the data presented here support the assumption that the mass-loss rate\nfrom the Mira star strongly varies and is focused on the orbital plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 12:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

The compound is found to retain the\nThCr2Si2-type tetragonal structure after ball-milling leading to a reduction in\nparticle size, typically falling in the range 10 - 100 nm. We find that there\nis a qualitative change in the temperature dependence of magnetic\nsusceptibility for such small particles, with respect to that known for bulk\nform. To understand this microscopically, Mossbauer spectra as a function of\ntemperature were taken. The Mossbauer spectrum of the nanocrystalline compound\nis essentially divalent-like at room temperature, but becomes distinctly\nbimodal at all temperatures below 300 K, unlike that of the bulk form. That is,\nthere is a progressive transfer of intensity from divalent position to\ntrivalent position with a gradual decrease of temperature. We attribute it to a\nfirst-order valence transition, with extreme broadening by defects in the nano\nspecimen. Thus, there is a qualitative change in the valence behavior in this\ncompound as the particle size is reduced by ball-milling.

The obtained reorientational relaxation\ntimes are well consistent with earlier inelastic light-scattering and\nhigh-frequency dielectric investigations. Evaluating our dielectric spectra in\nterms of reorientational motions reveals a close coupling of the ion-rotation\ndynamics to the ionic charge transport in a broad temperature range from the\nlow-viscosity liquid above room temperature deep into the high-viscosity\nsupercooled state close to Tg. This coupling does not seem to be mediated by\nthe viscosity but probably is of more direct nature, pointing to a\nrevolving-door mechanism as also considered for plastic-crystalline ionic\nconductors.

Recent research\nhas demonstrated that metric learning approaches can also be applied to trees,\nsuch as molecular structures, abstract syntax trees of computer programs, or\nsyntax trees of natural language, by learning the cost function of an edit\ndistance, i.e. the costs of replacing, deleting, or inserting nodes in a tree.\nHowever, learning such costs directly may yield an edit distance which violates\nmetric axioms, is challenging to interpret, and may not generalize well. In\nthis contribution, we propose a novel metric learning approach for trees which\nwe call embedding edit distance learning (BEDL) and which learns an edit\ndistance indirectly by embedding the tree nodes as vectors, such that the\nEuclidean distance between those vectors supports class discrimination. We\nlearn such embeddings by reducing the distance to prototypical trees from the\nsame class and increasing the distance to prototypical trees from different\nclasses. In our experiments, we show that BEDL improves upon the\nstate-of-the-art in metric learning for trees on six benchmark data sets,\nranging from computer science over biomedical data to a natural-language\nprocessing data set containing over 300,000 nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 13:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 09:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

Using a\nhydrodynamic approach we highlight the case of a gold mirror, and that of a\ntwo-layer system containing indium tin oxide (ITO) and gold. We assume the gold\nmirror surface is characterized by a free-electron cloud of varying density\nthat spills into the vacuum, which as a result of material dispersion exhibits\nepsilon-near-zero conditions and local field enhancement at the surface. For a\nbylayer consisting of a thin ITO and gold films, if the wave is incident from\nthe ITO side the electromagnetic field is presented with a free-electron\ndiscontinuity at the ITO/gold interface, and wavelength-dependent,\nepsilon-near-zero conditions that enhance local fields and conversion\nefficiencies, and determine the surface's emission properties. We evaluate the\nrelative significance of additional nonlinear sources that arise when a\nfree-electron discontinuity is present, and show that harmonic generation can\nbe sensitive to the density of the screening free-electron cloud, and not its\nthickness.

On the other hand, recently, significant advances have been made in\nmultidimensional signal completion algorithms that exploit tensor decomposition\nmodels to capture the intricate relationship among entries in a\nmultidimensional signal. We propose to use tensor completion applied to EEG\ndata for improving the classification performance in a motor imagery BCI system\nwith corrupted measurements. Noisy measurements are considered as unknowns that\nare inferred from a tensor decomposition model. We evaluate the performance of\nfour recently proposed tensor completion algorithms plus a simple interpolation\nstrategy, first with random missing entries and then with missing samples\nconstrained to have a specific structure (random missing channels), which is a\nmore realistic assumption in BCI Applications. We measured the ability of these\nalgorithms to reconstruct the tensor from observed data. Then, we tested the\nclassification accuracy of imagined movement in a BCI experiment with missing\nsamples. We show that for random missing entries, all tensor completion\nalgorithms can recover missing samples increasing the classification\nperformance compared to a simple interpolation approach. For the random missing\nchannels case, we show that tensor completion algorithms help to reconstruct\nmissing channels, significantly improving the accuracy in the classification of\nmotor imagery, however, not at the same level as clean data. Tensor completion\nalgorithms are useful in real BCI applications. The proposed strategy could\nallow using motor imagery BCI systems even when EEG data is highly affected by\nmissing channels and/or samples, avoiding the need of new acquisitions in the\ncalibration stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:16:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 15:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

This is a fundamental problem in\nthe field of social studies of science. The paper confronts this question here\nby showing vital determinants of science to explain the sources of social power\nand wealth creation by nations. Firstly, this study suggests a new general\ndefinition of science and scientific research that synthetizes previous\nconcepts and endeavors to extend them: Science discovers the root causes of\nphenomena to explain and predict them in a context of adaptation of life to new\neconomic and social bases, whereas scientific research is a systematic process,\napplying methods of scientific inquiry, to solve consequential problems, to\nsatisfy human wants, to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to\ncope with environmental threats. In particular, science and scientific research\nare driven by an organized social effort that inevitably reflect the concerns\nand interests of nations to achieve advances and discoveries that are spread to\nthe rest of humankind. This study reveals that scientific research is produced\nfor social and economic interests of nations (power, wealth creation,\ntechnological superiority, etc.), rather than philosophical inquiries. A main\nimplication of this study is that the immense growth of science in modern\nsociety is not only due to activity of scientists but rather to general social\nefforts of nations to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to cope\nwith environmental threats, such as war.

In\nthis paper a new dam breach modeling framework is introduced that shall improve\nthe reliability of hydrograph predictions of homogeneous earthen embankment\ndams. Striving for a small number of parameters, the simplified physics-based\nmodel describes the processes of failing embankment dams by breach enlargement,\ndriven by progressive surface erosion. Therein the erosion rate of dam material\nis modeled by empirical sediment transport formulations. Embedding the model\ninto a Bayesian multilevel framework allows for quantitative analysis of\ndifferent categories of uncertainties. To this end, data available in\nliterature of observed peak discharge and final breach width of historical dam\nfailures was used to perform model inversion by applying Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo simulation. Prior knowledge is mainly based on non-informative\ndistribution functions. The resulting posterior distribution shows that the\nmain source of uncertainty is a correlated subset of parameters, consisting of\nthe residual error term and the epistemic term quantifying the breach erosion\nrate. The prediction intervals of peak discharge and final breach width are\ncongruent with values known from literature. To finally predict the outflow\nhydrograph for real case applications, an alternative residual model was\nformulated that assumes perfect data and a perfect model.

The improved\naccuracy of the self-consistent method close to incoherence leads to an\naccurate estimate of the critical coupling corresponding to transitions from\nincoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 08:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

In the\nabsence of simplifying assumptions on the miscalibration, it is widely believed\nby the crowdsourcing community that the only useful information in the cardinal\nscores is the induced ranking. In this paper, inspired by the framework of\nStein's shrinkage, empirical Bayes, and the classic two-envelope problem, we\ncontest this widespread belief.

Given that the coupling\nof the membrane to the cell cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix and to other\ninternal structures is crucial for the regulation of a number of cellular\nprocesses, understanding the role of the pinning is of great interest. In this\nmanuscript we consider a single protein (elastic spring of a finite rest\nlength) pinning a membrane modelled in the Monge gauge. First, we determine the\nGreen$'$s function for the system and complement this approach by the\ncalculation of the mode coupling coefficients for the plane wave expansion, and\nthe orthonormal fluctuation modes, in turn building a set of tools for\nnumerical and analytic studies of a pinned membrane. Furthermore, we explore\nstatic correlations of the free and the pinned membrane, as well as the\nmembrane shape, showing that all three are mutually interdependent and have an\nidentical long-range behaviour characterised by the correlation length.\nInterestingly, the latter displays a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of\nmembrane tension. Importantly, exploiting these relations allows for the\nexperimental determination of the elastic parameters of the pinning. Last but\nnot least, we calculate the interaction potential between two pinning sites and\nshow that, even in the absence of the membrane deformation, the pinnings will\nbe subject to an attractive force due to changes in membrane fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 15:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 12:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

To\nevaluate the performance of our dictionary-based detection methods, we test our\nmethod on a labquake dataset from Penn State University, which contains\n3,357,566 time series data points with a 400 MHz sampling rate. 1,000\nearthquake events are manually labeled in total, and the length of these\nearthquake events varies from 74 to 7151 data points.

However, most\nexisting methods aim to explicitly model the transformation between different\nstyles, and the learned model is thus not generalizable to new styles. We here\npropose a unified style transfer framework for both character typeface transfer\nand neural style transfer tasks leveraging style and content separation. A key\nmerit of such framework is its generalizability to new styles and contents. The\noverall framework consists of style encoder, content encoder, mixer and\ndecoder. The style encoder and content encoder are used to extract the style\nand content representations from the corresponding reference images. The mixer\nintegrates the above two representations and feeds it into the decoder to\ngenerate images with the target style and content. During training, the encoder\nnetworks learn to extract styles and contents from limited size of\nstyle/content reference images. This learning framework allows simultaneous\nstyle transfer among multiple styles and can be deemed as a special\n`multi-task' learning scenario. The encoders are expected to capture the\nunderlying features for different styles and contents which is generalizable to\nnew styles and contents. Under this framework, we design two individual\nnetworks for character typeface transfer and neural style transfer,\nrespectively. For character typeface transfer, to separate the style features\nand content features, we leverage the conditional dependence of styles and\ncontents given an image. For neural style transfer, we leverage the statistical\ninformation of feature maps in certain layers to represent style.

The recent\nMeltdown and Spectre attacks have shown that this behavior can be exploited to\nexpose privileged information to an unprivileged attacker. In particular, the\nattack forces the speculative execution of a code gadget that will carry out\nthe illegal read, which eventually gets squashed, but which leaves a\nside-channel trail that can be used by the attacker to infer the value. Several\nattack variations are possible, allowing arbitrary exposure of the full kernel\nmemory to an unprivileged attacker. In this paper, we introduce a new model\n(SafeSpec) for supporting speculation in a way that is immune to side-channel\nleakage necessary for attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre. In particular,\nSafeSpec stores side effects of speculation in a way that is not visible to the\nattacker while the instructions are speculative. The speculative state is then\neither committed to the main CPU structures if the branch commits, or squashed\nif it does not, making all direct side effects of speculative code invisible.\nThe solution must also address the possibility of a covert channel from\nspeculative instructions to committed instructions before these instructions\nare committed. We show that SafeSpec prevents all three variants of Spectre and\nMeltdown, as well as new variants that we introduce. We also develop a cycle\naccurate model of modified design of an x86-64 processor and show that the\nperformance impact is negligible. We build prototypes of the hardware support\nin a hardware description language to show that the additional overhead is\nsmall. We believe that SafeSpec completely closes this class of attacks, and\nthat it is practical to implement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 00:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

Case: 844 postoperative\nCABG patients, who were extubated within 24 hours of surgery were identified in\na critical care database (MIMIC-III). Nurse elicited pain scores were\ndocumented throughout their hospital stay on a scale of 0 to 10. Levels were\ntracked as mean, median, and maximum values, and categorized as no (0/10), mild\n(1-3), moderate (4-6) and severe pain (7-10). Regression analysis was employed\nto analyze the relationship between pain scores and outcomes of interest\n(mortality and hospital LOS). After covariate adjustment, increased levels of\npain were found to be associated with lower mortality rates and reduced\nhospital LOS. Conclusion: These counterintuitive results for post-CABG pain\nrelated outcomes have not been previously reported. While not representing\nstrong enough evidence to alter clinical practice, confirmed and reliable\nresults such as these should serve as a research trigger and prompt further\nstudies into unexpected associations between pain and patient outcomes.

Uncertainty quantification of phase diagrams is the\nfirst step required to provide confidence for decision making in property- or\nperformance-based design. As a manner of illustration, a thorough probabilistic\nassessment of the CALPHAD model parameters is performed against the available\ndata for a Hf-Si binary case study using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling\napproach. The plausible optimum values and uncertainties of the parameters are\nthus obtained, which can be propagated to the resulting phase diagram. Using\nthe parameter values obtained from deterministic optimization in a\ncomputational thermodynamic assessment tool (in this case Thermo-Calc) as the\nprior information for the parameter values and ranges in the sampling process\nis often necessary to achieve a reasonable cost for uncertainty quantification.\nThis brings up the problem of finding an appropriate CALPHAD model with\nhigh-level of confidence which is a very hard and costly task that requires\nconsiderable expert skill. A Bayesian hypothesis testing based on Bayes'\nfactors is proposed to fulfill the need of model selection in this case, which\nis applied to compare four recommended models for the Hf-Si system.
