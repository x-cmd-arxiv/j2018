We consider selection from a class of stratified\nrandomization procedures which we call stratification trees: these are\nprocedures whose strata can be represented as decision trees, with differing\ntreatment assignment probabilities across strata. By using the first wave to\nestimate a stratification tree, we simultaneously select which covariates to\nuse for stratification, how to stratify over these covariates, as well as the\nassignment probabilities within these strata. Our main result shows that using\nthis randomization procedure with an appropriate estimator results in an\nasymptotic variance which is minimal in the class of stratification trees.\nMoreover, the results we present are able to accommodate a large class of\nassignment mechanisms within strata, including stratified block randomization.\nIn a simulation study, we find that our method, paired with an appropriate\ncross-validation procedure ,can improve on ad-hoc choices of stratification.

Observations indicate that\ninteractions funnel gas toward the nuclei, fueling bursts of star formation and\nnuclear activity. To date, most numerical simulations of galaxy mergers have\nassumed that the gaseous and stellar disks initially have the same distribution\nand size. However, observations of isolated disk galaxies show that this is\nseldom the case; in fact, most spirals have as much or more gas beyond their\noptical radii as they do within. Can gas in such extended disks be efficiently\ntransported to the nuclei during interactions?\n  To address this question, we examine the effect of various parameters on the\ntransport of gas to the nuclei of interacting galaxies. In addition to the\nrelative radii of the gaseous and stellar disks, these parameters include the\npericentric separation, disk orientation, fractional gas mass, presence of a\nbulge, treatment of gas thermodynamics, and the spatial resolution of the\nnumerical simulation. We found that gas accumulates in most of our simulated\nnuclei, but the efficiency of inflow is largely dependent upon the encounter\ngeometry. Dissipation alone is not enough to produce inflows; an efficient\nmechanism for extracting angular momentum from the gas is necessary. Several\ndifferent mechanisms are seen in these experiments. Aside from mode-driven\ninflows (such as, but not limited to, bars) and ram-pressure sweeping, both of\nwhich have been previously described and well studied, we supply the first\nquantitative study of an often-seen process: the formation of massive gas\nclumps in Jeans-unstable tidal shocks, and their subsequent delivery to the\nnuclei via dynamical friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 16:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Low-mass binaries in young\n($\\sim10 - 100 $ Myr) moving groups (YMGs) are of particular significance as\nthey provide unique opportunities to calibrate stellar models and evaluate the\nages and coevality of the groups themselves. Low-mass M-dwarfs have pre-main\nsequence life times on the order of $\\sim100$ Myr and therefore are continually\nevolving along a mass-luminosity track throughout the YMG phase, providing\nideal laboratories for precise isochronal dating, if a model-independent\ndynamical mass can be measured. AstraLux lucky imaging multiplicity surveys\nhave recently identified hundreds of new YMG low-mass binaries, where a\nsubsample of M-dwarf multiples have estimated orbital periods less than 50\nyears. We have conducted a radial velocity survey of a sample of 29 such\ntargets to complement the astrometric data. This will allow enhanced orbital\ndeterminations and precise dynamical masses to be derived in a shorter\ntimeframe than possible with astrometric monitoring alone, and allow for a more\nreliable isochronal analysis.

Such problems\nare naturally solved using policy based reinforcement learning (RL) methods,\nbut unfortunately these often suffer from high variance leading to instability\nand slow convergence. Unnecessary variance is introduced whenever policies over\nbounded action spaces are modeled using distributions with unbounded support by\napplying a transformation $T$ to the sampled action before execution in the\nenvironment. Recently, the variance reduced clipped action policy gradient\n(CAPG) was introduced for actions in bounded intervals, but to date no variance\nreduced methods exist when the action is a direction, something often seen in\nRTS games.

With the marginal\npolicy gradients family of estimators we present a unified analysis of the\nvariance reduction properties of APG and CAPG; our results provide a stronger\nguarantee than existing analyses for CAPG.

Their\nperformance is consistently robust even when the data contain large amounts of\nlabel noise.\n  Very little theory is available to explain these observations. The vast\nmajority of theoretical analyses of generalization allows for interpolation\nonly when there is little or no label noise. This paper takes a step toward a\ntheoretical foundation for interpolated classifiers by analyzing local\ninterpolating schemes, including geometric simplicial interpolation algorithm\nand singularly weighted $k$-nearest neighbor schemes. Consistency or\nnear-consistency is proved for these schemes in classification and regression\nproblems. Moreover, the nearest neighbor schemes exhibit optimal rates under\nsome standard statistical assumptions.\n  Finally, this paper suggests a way to explain the phenomenon of adversarial\nexamples, which are seemingly ubiquitous in modern machine learning, and also\ndiscusses some connections to kernel machines and random forests in the\ninterpolated regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 17:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 02:34:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 04:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

The\nlarge area and moderate depth of our survey provide a unique view of the\nintersection between the bright end of the galaxy UV luminosity function\n(M$_{AB}<-$22) and the faint end of the AGN UV luminosity function. We do not\nseparate AGN-dominated galaxies from star-formation-dominated galaxies, but\nrather fit both luminosity functions simultaneously. These functions are best\nfit with a double power-law (DPL) for both the galaxy and AGN components, where\nthe galaxy bright-end slope has a power-law index of $-3.80\\pm0.10$, and the\ncorresponding AGN faint-end slope is $\\alpha_{AGN} = -1.49^{+0.30}_{-0.21}$. We\ncannot rule out a Schechter-like exponential decline for the galaxy UV\nluminosity function, and in this scenario the AGN luminosity function has a\nsteeper faint-end slope of $-2.08^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$. Comparison of our galaxy\nluminosity function results with a representative cosmological model of galaxy\nformation suggests that the molecular gas depletion time must be shorter,\nimplying that star formation is more efficient in bright galaxies at $z=4$ than\nat the present day. If the galaxy luminosity function does indeed have a\npower-law shape at the bright end, the implied ionizing emissivity from AGNs is\nnot inconsistent with previous observations. However, if the underlying galaxy\ndistribution is Schechter, it implies a significantly higher ionizing\nemissivity from AGNs at this epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

The star formation rates (SFRs) derived\nfrom Br-alpha measured in the latter aperture agree well with SFRs(LIR), when\nthe dust extinction correction is adopted based on the 9.7um absorption\nfeature.

This permits the remainder of the system to act as a bath,\nthermalisation arising due to a process of de-phasing that gradually reveals\nthe thermal nature of local observables measured in an eigenstate. This is very\ndifferent from thermalisation in closed classical systems, which is driven by\ndynamical chaos. We show how quantum thermalisation in closed systems can be\nrecast in a way that is directly related to classical thermalisation. Local\nobservables can be accurately captured by projecting states onto a suitable\nvariational manifold. Evolving on this manifold using the time-dependent\nvariational principle projects the quantum dynamics onto a (semi-)classical\nHamiltonian dynamics. Thermalisation in this setting is driven by dynamical\nchaos.

To solve this model, we\nproposed a new method, mean-field of PS-strings (MF-PSSs). We find: 1) 3D-RSIM\nis a mixed system consisting of permanent-paraelectric-subsystem (PPSS),\nlow-transition-temperature ferroelectric-subsystem (LTT-FSS), and\nhigh-transition-temperature ferroelectric-subsystem (HTT-FSS). The contents of\nthese three subsystems change with the PS concentration (phi) of the model; 2)\nWhen phi < phi_p (phi_p is the percolation threshold of the 3D-RSIM), HTT-FSS\ndominates the whole system. On cooling, the system undergoes an\ninhomogeneous-diffuse-ferroelectric-phase-transition (IDFPT), and as phi\nincreases, it shows a crossover from the critical, gradually to Vogel-Fulcher,\nand to Arrehnius type slowdown. Specifically, we observe this crossover from\nthe relationship between the peak temperature (Tm) of the real susceptibility\nof the correlated relaxation of PSs and angular frequency (omega); 3) When phi\n= phi_p, the three subsystems have comparable contents. However, as temperature\ndecreases, the spontaneous polarization and specific heat of the whole system\nshow an IDFPT, but Tm shifts to lower temperature with omega until 0K. Since\nthe relaxation time of PPSS rapidly increases at lower temperature and diverges\nat 0K, during a cooling process at a limited rate, PPSS must be frozen at a\ncertain temperature, i.e. PS glass transition occurs. In short, with the\nincrease of phi, 3D-RSIGM gradually evolves from the IDFPT system to PS glass\nsystem, and phi_p is the characteristic concentration of this evolution.\nMoreover, based on the coupling between PSs and crystal lattice, we also give a\nnew possible mechanism of Burns transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 19:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

One recourse is to rely on\n\"internal\" image statistics, by searching for similar patterns within the input\nimage itself. In this work, we propose a new method for natural image denoising\nthat trains a deep neural network to determine whether patches in a noisy image\ninput share common underlying patterns. Given a pair of noisy patches, our\nnetwork predicts whether different sub-band coefficients of the original\nnoise-free patches are similar. The denoising algorithm then aggregates matched\ncoefficients to obtain an initial estimate of the clean image. Finally, this\nestimate is provided as input, along with the original noisy image, to a\nstandard regression-based denoising network. Experiments show that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art color image denoising performance, including with a\nblind version that trains a common model for a range of noise levels, and does\nnot require knowledge of level of noise in an input image.

However, the burden of the epidemic is challenging to\nquantify as public health surveillance measures capture different aspects of\nthe problem. Here we synthesize county-level death and treatment counts to\ncompare the relative burden across counties and assess associations with social\nenvironmental covariates. Methods: We construct a generalized spatial factor\nmodel to jointly model death and treatment rates for each county. For each\noutcome, we specify a spatial rates parameterization for a Poisson regression\nmodel with spatially varying factor loadings. We use a conditional\nautoregressive model to account for spatial dependence within a Bayesian\nframework. Results: The estimated spatial factor was highest in the southern\nand southwestern counties of the state, representing a higher burden of the\nopioid epidemic. We found that relatively high rates of treatment contributed\nto the factor in the southern part of the state; whereas, relatively higher\nrates of death contributed in the southwest. The estimated factor was also\npositively associated with the proportion of residents aged 18-64 on disability\nand negatively associated with the proportion of residents reporting white\nrace. Conclusions: We synthesized the information in the opioid associated\ndeath and treatment counts through a spatial factor model to estimate a latent\nfactor representing the consensus between the two surveillance measures.

Furthermore, the directional ion drifting driven by the electric\nforces may accelerate the kinetic process of metal particle precipitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 19:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

Multivariate dual framelets with vanishing moments generalize tight\nframelets and are not easy to be constructed either. Compactly supported\nmultivariate framelets with directionality or high vanishing moments are of\ninterest and importance in both theory and applications. In this paper we\nintroduce the notion of a quasi-tight framelet, which is a dual framelet, but\nbehaves almost like a tight framelet. Let $\\phi\\in L_2(R^d)$ be an arbitrary\ncompactly supported $M$-refinable function such that its underlying low-pass\nfilter satisfies the basic sum rule. We first constructively prove by a\nstep-by-step algorithm that we can always easily derive from the arbitrary\n$M$-refinable function $\\phi$ a directional compactly supported quasi-tight\n$M$-framelet in $L_2(R^d)$ associated with a directional quasi-tight\n$M$-framelet filter bank, each of whose high-pass filters has only two nonzero\ncoefficients with opposite signs.

A very surprising outcome is that not only mass\ngenerates gravity, but also electric charge does. Charge is, however, coupled\nto a non-geodesic vector field and thus is not totally equivalent to inertial\nmass. Only the entire \"Energy-Momentum\" tensor has a vanishing divergence. The\nmodel can be seen as misalignment of physically accessible events in an\nobserver spacetime and of gravity as a controlling response by volumetric\ncontraction of the observer spacetime in the direction where events bend or\naccelerate to. This non geodesic acceleration is described by a generalization\nof the Reeb vector. Misalignment of events can be described by 1, 2, and 3 such\nvectors. The paper presents a term with 4 vectors but does not discuss its\nphysical meaning. The paper also discusses particle mass ratios and the Fine\nStructure Constant where added or subtracted area in relation to a disk does\nnot involve a ratio 1/24 but 1/96 due to the physical meaning of the\norientation of a space foliation which is perpendicular to a time-like vector\nand due to the orientation of a plane which is perpendicular to a time-like\nvector. These two orientations mean that only one side of a 3-dimensional\nfoliation has a physical meaning and only one side of a sub-plane of that\nfoliation has a physical meaning then 1/2 1/2 1/24=1/96. Another interpretation\nof the factor 1/4 is the Bekenstein - Hawking entropy to area constant. An\nadditional coefficient 4/{\\pi} describes an acceleration field strength and has\na compelling source in mainstream physics. Other two field strength\ncoefficients are less understood but are very intuitive, these are 95/96 and a\ncritical value due to an imbalance equation between gravity and anti-gravity\n~1.55619853719.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 19:51:37 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 19:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 19:24:46 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 17:40:00 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 00:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 18:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 15:31:23 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 09:05:46 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 16:18:49 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2021 03:10:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 19:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 05:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v21","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 06:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v22","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v23","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 17:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v24","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 16:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v25","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 15:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v26","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 17:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v27","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 14:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2018 07:03:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 03:19:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 01:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 16:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 13:31:44 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 02:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 22:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

VLC facilitates the great advantage of being able to\njointly perform illumination and communications, and little extra power beyond\nillumination is required to empower communications, thus rendering wireless\naccess with almost zero power consumption. On the other hand, when illumination\nis not required from the light source, the energy consumed by VLC could be more\nthan that consumed by the RF. By capitalizing on the above properties, the\nproposed hybrid RF-VLC system is more energy efficient and more adaptive to the\nillumination conditions than the individual VLC or RF systems. To demonstrate\nthe viability of the proposed system, we first formulate the problem of\nminimizing the power consumption of the hybrid RF-VLC system while satisfying\nthe users requests and maintaining acceptable level of illumination, which is\nNP-complete. Therefore, we divide the problem into two subproblems. In the\nfirst subproblems, we determine the set of VLC access points (AP) that needs to\nbe turned on to satisfy the illumination requirements.

Surprisingly, this configuration is able to enhance\ndispersive measurement without exposing the qubit to appreciable excess\nbackaction. This is accomplished by engineering the circuit to permit\nhigh-power operation that reduces information loss to unmonitored channels\nassociated with the amplification and squeezing of quantum noise. By mitigating\nthe effects of off-chip losses downstream, the on-chip gain of this device\nproduces end-to-end measurement efficiencies of up to 80 percent. Our\ntheoretical model accurately describes the observed interplay of gain and\nmeasurement backaction, and delineates the parameter space for future\nimprovement.

The\ncorrectness of a distributed system is largely determined by its handling of\nfailure scenarios. The sequence of events leading to a bug can be long and\ncomplex, and it is likely to include message reorderings and failures. On\nsingle-node systems, interactive debuggers enable stepping through an execution\nof the program, but they lack the ability to easily simulate failure scenarios\nand control the order in which messages are delivered.\n  Oddity is a graphical, interactive debugger for distributed systems. It\nbrings the power of traditional step-through debugging---fine-grained control\nand observation of a program as it executes---to distributed systems. It also\nenables exploratory testing, in which an engineer examines and perturbs the\nbehavior of a system in order to better understand it, perhaps without a\nspecific bug in mind. A programmer can directly control message and failure\ninterleaving. Oddity supports time travel, allowing a developer to explore\nmultiple branching executions of a system within a single debugging session.\nAbove all, Oddity encourages distributed systems thinking: rather than assuming\nthe normal case and attaching failure handling as an afterthought, distributed\nsystems should be developed around the certainty of message loss and node\nfailure.\n  Graduate and undergraduate students used Oddity in two distributed systems\nclasses. Usage tracking and qualitative surveys showed that students found\nOddity useful for both debugging and exploratory testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 23:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

Towards this\ndirection, full-duplex (FD) technology, being able to boost the spectral\nefficiency by transmitting and receiving simultaneously on the same frequency\nand time resources, is envisaged to play a key role in future networks.\nHowever, its benefits come at the expense of self-interference (SI) from their\nown transmit signal. At the same time, massive MIMO systems, bringing\nunconventionally many antennas, emerge as a promising technology with huge\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoF). To this end, this paper considers a multi-pair\ndecode-and-forward FD relay channel, where the relay station is deployed with a\nlarge number of antennas. Moreover, the rate-splitting (RS) transmission has\nrecently been shown to provide significant performance benefits in various\nmulti-user scenarios with imperfect channel state information at the\ntransmitter (CSIT). Engaging the RS approach, we employ the deterministic\nequivalent (DE) analysis to derive the corresponding sum-rates in the presence\nof interferences. Initially, numerical results demonstrate the robustness of RS\nin half-duplex (HD) systems, since the achievable sum-rate increases without\nbound, i.e., it does not saturate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Next, we\ntackle the detrimental effect of SI in FD. In particular, and most importantly,\nnot only FD outperforms HD, but also RS enables increasing the range of SI over\nwhich FD outperforms HD. Furthermore, increasing the number of relay station\nantennas, RS appears to be more efficacious due to imperfect CSIT, since SI\ndecreases. Interestingly, increasing the number of users, the efficiency of RS\nworsens and its implementation becomes less favorable under these conditions.\nFinally, we verify that the proposed DEs, being accurate for a large number of\nrelay station antennas, are tight approximations even for realistic system\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 00:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

These three-body interactions are expected to induce significant\norbital eccentricity $\\gtrsim 0.1$ when they enter the Advanced LIGO band at a\ngravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz. Measurements of binary black hole\neccentricity therefore provide a means for determining whether or not dynamic\nformation is the primary channel for producing binary black hole mergers. We\npresent a framework for performing Bayesian parameter estimation on\ngravitational-wave observations of black hole inspirals. Using this framework,\nand employing the non-spinning, inspiral-only EccentricFD waveform approximant,\nwe determine the minimum detectable eccentricity for an event with masses and\ndistance similar to GW150914. At design sensitivity, we find that the current\ngeneration of advanced observatories will be sensitive to orbital\neccentricities of $\\gtrsim0.05$ at a gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz,\ndemonstrating that existing detectors can use eccentricity to distinguish\nbetween circular field binaries and globular cluster triples.

A powerful and well established model for real world signals in\nvarious domains is sparse representation over a dictionary, combined with the\nability to train the dictionary from signal examples. This model has been\nsuccessfully applied to graph signals as well by integrating the underlying\ngraph topology into the learned dictionary. Nonetheless, dictionary learning\nmethods for graph signals are typically restricted to small dimensions due to\nthe computational constraints that the dictionary learning problem entails, and\ndue to the direct use of the graph Laplacian matrix. In this paper, we propose\na dictionary learning algorithm that applies to a broader class of graph\nsignals, and is capable of handling much higher dimensional data. We\nincorporate the underlying graph topology both implicitly, by forcing the\nlearned dictionary atoms to be sparse combinations of graph-wavelet functions,\nand explicitly, by adding direct graph constraints to promote smoothness in\nboth the feature and manifold domains. The resulting atoms are thus adapted to\nthe data of interest while adhering to the underlying graph structure and\npossessing a desired multi-scale property. Experimental results on several\ndatasets, representing both synthetic and real network data of different\nnature, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for graph\nsignal processing even in high dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 04:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

This requires multi-step forecasting, a forecasting variant\nwhere one aims to predict multiple values in the future simultaneously.\nStandard methods to accomplish this can propagate error from prediction to\nprediction, reducing quality over the long term.

We search for low-state VHE gamma-ray emission from PKS\n1510-089. We aim to characterize and model the source in a broad-band context,\nwhich would provide a baseline over which high states and flares could be\nbetter understood. We use daily binned Fermi-LAT flux measurements of PKS\n1510-089 to characterize the GeV emission and select the observation periods of\nMAGIC during low state of activity. For the selected times we compute the\naverage radio, IR, optical, UV, X-ray and gamma-ray emission to construct a\nlow-state spectral energy distribution of the source. The broadband emission is\nmodelled within an External Compton scenario with a stationary emission region\nthrough which plasma and magnetic field are flowing. We perform also the\nemission-model-independent calculations of the maximum absorption in the broad\nline region (BLR) using two different models. Results. The MAGIC telescopes\ncollected 75 hrs of data during times when the Fermi-LAT flux measured above 1\nGeV was below 3x10-8cm-2s-1, which is the threshold adopted for the definition\nof a low gamma-ray activity state. The data show a strongly significant\n(9.5{\\sigma}) VHE gamma-ray emission at the level of\n(4.27+-0.61stat)x10-12cm-2s-1 above 150GeV, a factor 80 smaller than the\nhighest flare observed so far from this object. Despite the lower flux, the\nspectral shape is consistent with earlier detections in the VHE band. The\nbroad-band emission is compatible with the EC scenario assuming a large\nemission region located beyond the BLR. For the first time the gamma-ray data\nallow us to place a limit on the location of the emission region during a low\ngamma-ray state of a FSRQ. For the used model of the BLR, the 95% C.L. on the\nlocation of the emission region allows us to place it at the distance >74% of\nthe outer radius of the BLR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 05:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 15:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

In\nthis study, we set up a realistic model to show the effect of the Lorentz force\nin the polarity selection. The important results that has come out from our\nstudy is that the magnetic field acts on the flow much before the saturation.\nOur study suggests that the growth of the magnetic field is not a kinematic\neffect as one might think off, rather a dynamic effect. This dynamic effect\ngrows as the field generated with time and finally brings the saturation to the\ndynamo action. Previous studies show that Lorentz force effect the flow when\nElsasser number more or less 1 and the studies were focused on the saturation\nby looking at the time-averaged quantities. However, in this study, we show a\nclear effect of the Lorentz force even at Elsasser number of $0.3-0.4$. To show\nthe effect of the Lorentz force, we did two different simulations, one is a\nnonlinear model and another is kinematic model and shows that how a magnetic\nfield can change the flow structure and by doing that the generated field\nchanges, while this kind of behavior is not observed in kinematic dynamo\nmodels.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nattention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) which regulates multiple\nobject parts among different input images. Our method first learns multiple\nattention region features of each input image through the one-squeeze\nmulti-excitation (OSME) module, and then apply the multi-attention multi-class\nconstraint (MAMC) in a metric learning framework. For each anchor feature, the\nMAMC functions by pulling same-attention same-class features closer, while\npushing different-attention or different-class features away.

Two potential heating scenarios have been suggested to\nexplain these observations. One scenario is that the loops are heated by a\nseries of small-scale impulsive heating events, or nanoflares. Another\nhypothesis is that the heating is quasi-steady and highly-stratified, i.e.,\n``footpoint heating'. The goal of this paper is to identify observables that\ncan be used to differentiate between these two heating scenarios. For footpoint\nheating, we vary the heating magnitude and stratification, for impulsive\nheating, we vary the heating magnitude. We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic\ncodes to calculate the resulting temperature and density evolution and expected\nlightcurves in four channels of AIA and one channel of XRT. We consider two\nprincipal diagnostics: the time lag between the appearance of the loop in two\ndifferent channels, and the ratio of the peak intensities of the loop in the\ntwo channels. We find that 1) footpoint heating can predict longer time lags\nthan impulsive heating, 2) footpoint heating can predict zero or negative time\nlags, 3) the intensity ratio expected from impulsive heating is confined to a\nnarrow range, while footpoint heating predicts a wider range of intensity\nratios, and 4) the range of temperatures expected in impulsive heating is\nbroader than the range of temperatures expected in footpoint heating.

The model is criticized at times for being overly\nconservative since the worst-case distribution is discrete with a few support\npoints. However, it is the order quantity prescribed from the model that is of\npractical relevance. A simple calculation shows that the optimal order quantity\nin Scarf's model with known first and second moment is also optimal for a\ncensored student-t distribution with parameter 2. In this paper, we generalize\nthis \"heavy-tail optimality\" property of the distributionally robust newsvendor\nto an ambiguity set where information on the first and the $\\alpha$th moment is\nknown, for any real number $\\alpha > 1$. We show that the optimal order\nquantity for the distributionally robust newsvendor problem is also optimal for\na regularly varying distribution with roughly a power law tail with tail index\n$\\alpha$. We illustrate the usefulness of the model in the high service level\nregime with numerical experiments, by showing that when a standard distribution\nsuch as the exponential or lognormal distribution is contaminated with a\nheavy-tailed (regularly varying) distribution, the distributionally robust\noptimal order quantity outperforms the optimal order quantity of the original\ndistribution, even with a small amount of contamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 06:18:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 01:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Their\ninfluence depends on the grain composition, size, and geometrical structure\nwhich vary throughout the dust lifecycle. Grain growth arises in dense media as\ntraced by an enhancement of the FIR emissivity and by cloudshine and coreshine.\nWe investigate the imprint of the grain characteristics on the dust unpolarised\noptical properties from the visible to the FIR for isolated grains and\naggregates. Using optical constants for both carbonaceous and silicate\nmaterials, we derive the absorption and scattering efficiencies, the asymmetry\nfactor of the phase function, the albedo, and the mass opacity, using either\nMie theory or DDA. We study the effects of the size, porosity and shape of the\ngrains, and of the monomers constituting the aggregates, on the optical\nproperties. For aggregates we study the influence of the number of monomers and\nof mixing monomer sizes. Grain structure changes result in variations at all\nwavelengths. Porosity, grain elongation, and aggregation all produce an\nincrease in the FIR opacity. The spectral dependence of this increase depends\non the nature of the material composing the grain: it is independent of the\nwavelength for insulators but not for conductors. For aggregates, the FIR\nincrease does not depend on the monomer size and saturates for aggregates\ncontaining 6 or more monomers. For silicates, the MIR spectral feature at 18\nmicrons is more sensitive to the details of the grain structure than the 10\nmicrons feature. This study provides a basis for understanding the range of\nvariations achievable as a result of varying the grain characteristics. It\nemphasises the importance of considering the detailed grain structure in\ndetermining the dust optical properties and of using exact methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 09:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

The belts get dynamically excited, either by planets\n('planet stirring') or by embedded big planetesimals ('self-stirring').\nCollisions between planetesimals become destructive and start to produce dust,\ncreating an observable debris disc. Following Kenyon & Bromley (2008), it is\noften assumed that self-stirring starts to operate as soon as the first ~1000\nkm-sized embedded 'Plutos' have formed. However, state-of-the-art pebble\nconcentration models robustly predict planetesimals between a few km and ~200\nkm in size to form in protoplanetary discs rapidly, before then slowly growing\ninto Pluto-sized bodies. We show that the timescale, on which these\nplanetesimals excite the disc sufficiently for fragmentation, is shorter than\nthe formation timescale of Plutos. Using an analytic model based on the Ida &\nMakino (1993) theory, backed up by numerical integrations, we find the\nexcitation timescale to be $T_{\\rm excite} \\approx 100 x_{\\rm m}^{-1}\nM_*^{-3/2} a^3$ Myr, where $x_{\\rm m}$ is the total mass of a protoplanetary\ndisc progenitor in the units of the Minimum-Mass Solar Nebula, $a$ its radius\nin the units of 100 AU, and $M_*$ is the stellar mass in solar masses. These\nresults are applied to a set of 23 debris discs that have been well resolved\nwith ALMA or SMA. We find that the majority of these discs are consistent with\nbeing self-stirred. However, three large discs around young early-type stars do\nrequire planets as stirrers. These are 49 Cet, HD 95086, and HR 8799, of which\nthe latter two are already known to have planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 09:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 07:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

The key process allowing persistence is the repeated\nreinvasion of extinct patches from neighbouring areas where the disease has\nflared up and died out, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium with different\nlevels of spatial heterogeneity.

Many companies\nemploy resources and money to generate these models and provide them as an API,\ntherefore it is in their best interest to protect them, i.e., to avoid that\nsomeone else copies them. Recent studies revealed that state-of-the-art CNNs\nare vulnerable to adversarial examples attacks, and this weakness indicates\nthat CNNs do not need to operate in the problem domain (PD). Therefore, we\nhypothesize that they also do not need to be trained with examples of the PD in\norder to operate in it.\n  Given these facts, in this paper, we investigate if a target black-box CNN\ncan be copied by persuading it to confess its knowledge through random\nnon-labeled data. The copy is two-fold: i) the target network is queried with\nrandom data and its predictions are used to create a fake dataset with the\nknowledge of the network; and ii) a copycat network is trained with the fake\ndataset and should be able to achieve similar performance as the target\nnetwork.\n  This hypothesis was evaluated locally in three problems (facial expression,\nobject, and crosswalk classification) and against a cloud-based API. In the\ncopy attacks, images from both non-problem domain and PD were used. All copycat\nnetworks achieved at least 93.7% of the performance of the original models with\nnon-problem domain data, and at least 98.6% using additional data from the PD.\nAdditionally, the copycat CNN successfully copied at least 97.3% of the\nperformance of the Microsoft Azure Emotion API. Our results show that it is\npossible to create a copycat CNN by simply querying a target network as\nblack-box with random non-labeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 11:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

In high-dimensional integration, such methods quickly\nbecome infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. A common alternative is\nthe Monte Carlo method (MC), which simply takes the average of random samples,\nimproving the estimate as more and more samples are taken. The main issue with\nMC is its slow (though dimension-independent) convergence, and various\ntechniques have been proposed to reduce the variance. In this work we suggest a\nnumerical analyst's interpretation of MC: it approximates the integrand with a\nconstant function, and integrates that constant exactly. This observation leads\nnaturally to MC-like methods where the approximant is a non-constant function,\nfor example low-degree polynomials, sparse grids or low-rank functions. We show\nthat these methods have the same $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ asymptotic convergence as in\nMC, but with reduced variance, equal to the quality of the underlying function\napproximation. We also discuss methods that improve the approximation quality\nas more samples are taken, and thus can converge faster than $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$.\nThe main message is that techniques in high-dimensional approximation theory\ncan be combined with Monte Carlo integration to accelerate convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 12:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

The\noverlapping nature of playing careers is exploited to form a bridge from past\nto present so that all players can be compared simultaneously, rather than just\nrelative to their contemporaries. The natural variation in runs scored by a\nbatsman is modelled by an additive log-linear model with year, age and\ncricket-specific components used to extract the innate ability of an individual\ncricketer. Incomplete innings are handled via censoring and a zero-inflated\ncomponent is incorporated into the model to allow for an excess of frailty at\nthe start of an innings.

We perform\nphysics-based simulations of proton acceleration using information on the shock\nand ambient plasma parameters derived from the observation of a real GLE event.\nWe analyse the simulation results with the aim to find out which of the\nparameters are significant in controlling the acceleration efficiency and to\nget a better understanding of the conditions under which the shock can produce\nrelativistic protons. We use results of the recently developed technique to\ndetermine the shock and ambient plasma parameters, applied to the 17 May 2012\nGLE event, and carry out proton acceleration simulations with the Coronal Shock\nAcceleration model. We have performed proton acceleration simulations for nine\nindividual magnetic field lines characterised by various plasma conditions.\nAnalysis of the simulation results shows that the acceleration efficiency of\nthe shock, i.e., its ability to accelerate particles to high energies, tends to\nbe higher for those shock portions that are characterised by larger values of\nthe scattering-centre compression ratio and/or the fast-mode Mach number. At\nthe same time, the acceleration efficiency can be strengthened due to enhanced\nplasma density in the flux tube. Analysis of the delays between the flare onset\nand the production times of protons of 1 GV rigidity for different field lines\nin our simulations, and a subsequent comparison of those with the observed\nvalues indicate a possibility that quasi-perpendicular portions of the shock\nplay the main role in producing relativistic protons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 12:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

In contrast, we propose the\nuse of translated sentences as context that is always available regardless of\nthe domain. We find that naive feature expansion of translations gains only\nmarginal improvements and may decrease the performance of the classifier, due\nto possible inaccurate translations thus producing noisy sentence vectors. To\nthis end, we present multiple context fixing attachment (MCFA), a series of\nmodules attached to multiple sentence vectors to fix the noise in the vectors\nusing the other sentence vectors as context.

Tell-tale signs such as failed\nnavigation, \"sixth sense\" knowledge of human players' whereabouts and\ndeterministic, scripted behaviors are some of the causes of this. We propose,\nhowever, that one of the biggest indicators of non humanlike behavior in these\ngames can be found in the weapon shooting capability of the bot. Consistently\nperfect accuracy and \"locking on\" to opponents in their visual field from any\ndistance are indicative capabilities of bots that are not found in human\nplayers. Traditionally, the bot is handicapped in some way with either a timed\nreaction delay or a random perturbation to its aim, which doesn't adapt or\nimprove its technique over time. We hypothesize that enabling the bot to learn\nthe skill of shooting through trial and error, in the same way a human player\nlearns, will lead to greater variation in game-play and produce less\npredictable non player characters. This paper describes a reinforcement\nlearning shooting mechanism for adapting shooting over time based on a dynamic\nreward signal from the amount of damage caused to opponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 14:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

It is found that the first $2^+$ state and the low-energy\nquadrupole states between 3 and 6 MeV display an opposite behavior with\nincreasing neutron number. While the strength of the first $2^+$ state\ndecreases, some excited states start to accumulate between 3 and 6 MeV, and\nincrease their strength with increasing neutron number. This low-energy region\nbetween 3 and 6 MeV is quite sensitive to the changes in the shell structure\nwith increasing neutron number.

It aims at identifying\nregional wall motions into one of the four types including normal, hypokinetic,\nakinetic, and dyskinetic, and is extremely challenging due to the complex\nmyocardium deformation and subtle inter-class difference of motion patterns.\nAll existing work on automated motion analysis are focused on binary\nabnormality detection to avoid the much more demanding motion scoring, which is\nurgently required in real clinical practice yet has never been investigated\nbefore. In this work, we propose Cardiac-MOS, the first powerful method for\ncardiac motion scoring from cardiac MR sequences based on deep convolution\nneural network. Due to the locality of convolution, the relationship between\ndistant non-local responses of the feature map cannot be explored, which is\nclosely related to motion difference between segments. In Cardiac-MOS, such\nnon-local relationship is modeled with non-local neural network within each\nsegment and across all segments of one subject, i.e., segment- and\nsubject-level non-local modeling, and lead to obvious performance improvement.\nBesides, Cardiac-MOS can effectively extract motion information from MR\nsequences of various lengths by interpolating the convolution kernel along the\ntemporal dimension, therefore can be applied to MR sequences of multiple\nsources. Experiments on 1440 myocardium segments of 90 subjects from short axis\nMR sequences of multiple lengths prove that Cardiac-MOS achieves reliable\nperformance, with correlation of 0.926 for motion score index estimation and\naccuracy of 77.4\\% for motion scoring. Cardiac-MOS also outperforms all\nexisting work for binary abnormality detection. As the first automatic motion\nscoring solution, Cardiac-MOS demonstrates great potential in future clinical\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 14:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel cascade amplifier regression network (CARN), which includes the CARN\narchitecture and local shape-constrained manifold regularization (LSCMR) loss\nfunction, to achieve accurate direct automated multiple indices estimation. The\nCARN architecture is composed of a cascade amplifier network (CAN) for\nexpressive feature embedding and a linear regression model for multiple indices\nestimation. The CAN consists of cascade amplifier units (AUs), which are used\nfor selective feature reuse by stimulating effective feature and suppressing\nredundant feature during propagating feature map between adjacent layers, thus\nan expressive feature embedding is obtained. During training, the LSCMR is\nutilized to alleviate overfitting and generate realistic estimation by learning\nthe multiple indices distribution.

This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty\nsystems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early\nUniverse was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward\nevolution galaxy model described by Casey et al. (2018) to the ALMA regime (in\ndepth and area) and determine that the measured number counts and redshift\ndistributions from ALMA deep field surveys are fully consistent with\nconstraints of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) at $z<2.5$ determined by\nsingle-dish submillimeter and millimeter surveys conducted on much larger\nangular scales ($\\sim1-10$deg$^{2}$). We find that measured 1.1-1.3mm number\ncounts are most constraining for the measurement of the faint-end slope of the\nIRLF at $z<2.5$ instead of the prevalence of dusty galaxies at $z>4$. Recent\nstudies have suggested that UV-selected galaxies at $z>4$ may be particularly\ndust-poor, but we find their millimeter-wave emission cannot rule out\nconsistency with the Calzetti dust attenuation law even by assuming relatively\ntypical, cold-dust ($T_{\\rm dust}\\approx30\\,$K) SEDs. Our models suggest that\nthe design of ALMA deep fields requires substantial revision to constrain the\nprevalence of $z>4$ early Universe obscured starbursts. The most promising\navenue for detection and characterization of such early dusty galaxies will\ncome from future ALMA 2mm blank field surveys covering a few hundred\narcmin$^{2}$ and the combination of existing and future dual-purpose 3mm\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 15:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

J. Uncertain. Quantif., 7\n(2017), pp. 57--81]. In this article, an alternative approach is considered,\nusing Quasi-Monte Carlo points, to speed up convergence. Additionally, our\nmethod comes with an improved variance estimate which is also valid in case of\nthe Monte Carlo based approach. The new method is illustrated on the example of\nan elliptic PDE with lognormal diffusion coefficient. Numerical results for a\nvariety of random fields with different smoothness parameters in the Mat\\'ern\ncovariance function show that sample recycling is more efficient when the input\nrandom field is nonsmooth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 15:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-15"}

Unfortunately, despite its intriguing properties, such as\nrelatively large spin-orbit interactions, one of the biggest hurdles for\nsilicene to be useful as a host spintronic material is the lack of magnetism or\nthe topological phase transition owing to the silicene-substrate interactions,\nwhich influence its fundamental properties and has yet to be fully explored.\nHere, we show that when silicene is grown on CeO2 substrate, an appreciable\nrobust magnetic moment appears in silicene covalently bonded to CeO2 (111),\nwhile a topological phase transition to a band insulator occurs regardless of\nvan der Waals (vdWs) interaction or covalent bonding interaction at interface.\nThe induced magnetism of silicene is due to the breaking of Si-Si\n{\\pi}-bonding, also resulting in trivial topological phase. The\nsilicene-substrate interaction, even weak vdWs force (equivalent to an electric\nfield), can destroy quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) of silicene. We propose a\nviable strategy --- constructing inverse symmetrical sandwich structure\n(protective layer/silicene/substrate) --- to preserve quantum spin Hall (QSH)\nstate of silicene in weak vdWs interaction system.

Substantial increases of\nmomentum resolution respect to standard fit is obtained. The key point is the\nuse of a realistic probability distribution for each hit (heteroscedasticity).\nTwo different methods are used for the fits, the first method introduces an\neffective variance for each hit, the second method implements the maximum\nlikelihood search. The tracker model is similar to the PAMELA tracker. Each\nside, of the two sided of the PAMELA detectors, is simulated as momentum\nreconstruction device. One of the two is similar to silicon micro-strip\ndetectors of large use in running experiments. Two different position\nreconstructions are used for the standard fits, the $\\eta$-algorithm (the best\none) and the two-strip center of gravity. The gain obtained in momentum\nresolution is measured as the virtual magnetic field and the virtual\nsignal-to-noise ratio required by the two standard fits to reach an overlap\nwith the best of two new methods. For the best side, the virtual magnetic field\nmust be increased 1.5 times respect to the real field to reach the overlap and\n1.8 for the other.

The signal-to-noise ratio has no effect on the fits with the\ncenter of gravity.

Tight framelets are often derived\nfrom particular refinable functions satisfying certain stringent conditions.\nConsequently, a large family of refinable functions cannot be used to construct\ntight framelets. This motivates us to introduce the notion of a quasi-tight\nframelet, which is a dual framelet but behaves almost like a tight framelet. It\nturns out that the study of quasi-tight framelets is intrinsically linked to\nthe problem of the generalized matrix spectral factorization for matrices of\nLaurent polynomials. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation on\nthe generalized matrix spectral factorization problem and compactly supported\nquasi-tight framelets.

While diversification is widely explored in the literature,\nintegration is most present in literature on contagions.
