Here we review the\nphysics of the SO coupled quantum gases, focusing on the latest theoretical and\nexperimental progresses of realizing SO couplings beyond one-dimension (1D),\nand the further investigation of novel topological quantum phases in such\nsystems, including the topological insulating phases and topological\nsuperfluids. A pedagogical introduction to the SO coupling for ultracold atoms\nand topological quantum phases is presented. We show that the so-called optical\nRaman lattice schemes, which combine the creation of the conventional optical\nlattice and Raman lattice with topological stability, can provide minimal\nmethods with high experimental feasibility to realize 1D to 3D SO couplings.\nThe optical Raman lattices exhibit novel intrinsic symmetries, which enable the\nnatural realization of topological phases belonging to different symmetry\nclasses, with the topology being detectable through minimal measurement\nstrategies. We introduce how the non-Abelian Majorana modes emerge in the SO\ncoupled superfluid phases which can be topologically nontrivial or trivial, for\nwhich a few fundamental theorems are presented and discussed. The experimental\nschemes for achieving non-Abelian superfluid phases are given.

To assess whether this could lead\nto a maximum of the non-thermal emission before apastron, we derive simple\nprescriptions for the non-thermal energy content, the radiation efficiency, and\nthe impact of energy losses on non-thermal particles, in the simulated\nhydrodynamical flow. These prescriptions are used to estimate the non-thermal\nemission in radio, X-rays, GeV, and TeV, from the shocked pulsar wind in a\nbinary system simulated using a simplified 3-dimensional scheme for several\norbital cycles. Lightcurves at different wavelengths are derived, together with\nsynthetic radio images for different orbital phases.

In particular, in each iteration we take a gradient step with\nprobability $q$ and a SAGA step with probability $1-q$. We show that,\nsurprisingly, the total expected complexity of the method (which is obtained by\nmultiplying the number of iterations by the expected number of gradients\ncomputed in each iteration) is minimized for a non-trivial probability $q$. For\nexample, for a well conditioned problem the choice $q=1/(n-1)^2$, where $n$ is\nthe number of data samples, gives a method with an overall complexity which is\nbetter than both the complexity of GD and SAGA.

Recently it was experimentally observed that the FS is deformed\nfrom a sphere to an ellipsoid due to the presence of the anisotropic and\nlong-range dipole-dipole interaction. Moreover, it was suggested that, when the\ndipoles are rotated by means of an external field, the FS follows their\nrotation, thereby keeping the major axis of the momentum-space ellipsoid\nparallel to the dipoles. Here we generalise a previous Hartree-Fock mean-field\ntheory to systems confined in an elongated triaxial trap with an arbitrary\norientation of the dipoles relative to the trap. With this we study for the\nfirst time the effects of the dipoles' arbitrary orientation on the\nground-state properties of the system. Furthermore, taking into account the\ngeometry of the system, we show how the ellipsoidal FS deformation can be\nreconstructed, assuming ballistic expansion, from the experimentally measurable\nreal-space aspect ratio after a free expansion. We compare our theoretical\nresults with new experimental data measured with an erbium Fermi gas for\nvarious trap parameters and dipole orientations. The observed remarkable\nagreement demonstrates the ability of our model to capture the full angular\ndependence of the FS deformation. Moreover, for systems with even higher dipole\nmoment, our theory predicts an additional unexpected effect: the FS does not\nsimply follow rigidly the orientation of the dipoles, but softens showing a\nchange in the aspect ratio depending on the dipoles' orientation relative to\nthe trap geometry, as well as on the trap anisotropy itself.

One promising\nheating scenario invokes the dissipation of Alfv\\'en waves that are generated\nby streaming cosmic rays (CRs). In order to study this idea, we use\nthree-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with the AREPO code that\nfollow the evolution of jet-inflated bubbles that are filled with CRs in a\nturbulent cluster atmosphere. We find that a single injection event produces\nthe CR distribution and heating rate required for a successful CR heating\nmodel. As a bubble rises buoyantly, cluster magnetic fields drape around the\nleading interface and are amplified to strengths that balance the ram pressure.\nTogether with helical magnetic fields in the bubble, this initially confines\nthe CRs and suppresses the formation of interface instabilities. But as the\nbubble continues to rise, bubble-scale eddies significantly amplify radial\nmagnetic filaments in its wake and enable CR transport from the bubble to the\ncooling intracluster medium. By varying the jet parameters, we obtain a rich\nand diverse set of jet and bubble morphologies ranging from Fanaroff-Riley type\nI-like (FRI) to FRII-like jets. We identify jet energy as the leading order\nparameter (keeping the ambient density profiles fixed), whereas jet luminosity\nis primarily responsible for setting the Mach numbers of shocks around\nFRII-like sources.

We show that a similar\nphenomenon exists for laminar pipe flow profiles in the sense that the\nnonlinear stability of the laminar state is enhanced as the profile becomes\nmore flattened. Significant drag reduction is also observed for the turbulent\nflow when triggered by sufficiently large disturbances. The flattening is\nproduced by an artificial body force designed to mimick a baffle used in the\nexperiments of Kuehnen et al. (2018) and the nonlinear stability measured by\nthe size of the energy of the initial perturbations needed to trigger\ntransition. In order to make the latter computation more efficient, we examine\nhow indicative the minimal seed for transition is in measuring transition\nthresholds. We first show that the minimal seed is relatively robust to base\nprofile changes and spectral filtering. We then compare the (unforced)\ntransition behaviour of the minimal seed with several forms of randomised\ninitial conditions in the range of Reynolds numbers Re=2400 to 10000 and find\nthat the energy of the minimal seed after the Orr and oblique phases of its\nevolution is close to that of a localised random disturbance. In this sense,\nthe minimal seed at the end of the oblique phase can be regarded as a good\nproxy for typical disturbances (here taken to be the localised random ones) and\nis thus used as initial condition in the simulations with the body force. The\nenhanced nonlinear stability and drag reduction predicted in the present study\nare an encouraging first step in modelling the experiments of Kuehnen et al.\nand should motivate future developments to fully exploit the benefits of this\npromising direction for flow control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 18:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

The eclipse mapping problem, let alone combined\nphase+eclipse mapping, does not lend itself to such a neat solution. Previous\nefforts have either adopted spherical harmonics, or various ad hoc map\nparameterizations, none of which produce orthogonal lightcurves. We use\nprincipal component analysis to construct orthogonal \"eigencurves,\" which we\nthen use to fit published 8 micron observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b.\nThis approach has a few advantages over previously used techniques: 1) the\nlightcurves can be pre-computed, accelerating the fitting process, 2) the\neigencurves are orthogonal to each other, reducing parameter correlations, and\n3) the eigencurves are model-independent and are ranked in order of\nsensitivity. One notable result of our analysis is that eclipse-only mapping of\nHD 189733b is far more sensitive to the central concentration of dayside flux\nthan to the eastward offset of that hotspot. Mapping can, in principle, suffer\nfrom degeneracies between spatial patterns and orbital parameters.

To justify this assumption we observe that stars undergo\nthermodynamically irreversible processes and emit heat and radiation to their\nsurroundings. Due to the emission of this energy it is worthwhile to consider\nan idealized model in which the gas is polytropic. To find interior solutions\nto the Einstein equations of General Relativity in this setting we derive a\nsingle equation for the cumulative mass distribution of the star and use\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to derive formulas for the isentropic index\nand coefficient. Using these formulas we present analytic and numerical\nsolutions for the polytropic structure of self-gravitating stars and examine\ntheir stability.

However, accessing the physics at these interfaces, which are\noften buried deep below the sample surface, remains difficult. Addressing this\nchallenge requires techniques capable of measuring the local electronic\nstructure with high-resolution depth dependence. Here, we have used\nlinearly-polarized resonant X-ray reflectometry (RXR) as a means to visualize\ncharge transfer in oxide superlattices with atomic layer precision. From our\nRXR measurements, we extract valence depth profiles of SmTiO$_3$\n(SmTO)/SrTiO$_3$ (STO) heterostructures with STO quantum wells varying in\nthickness from 5 SrO planes down to a single, atomically thin SrO plane. At the\npolar-nonpolar SmTO/STO interface, an electrostatic discontinuity leads to\napproximately half an electron per areal unit cell transferred from the\ninterfacial SmO layer into the neighboring STO quantum well. We observe this\ncharge transfer as a suppression of the t$_{2g}$ absorption peaks that\nminimizes contrast with the neighboring SmTO layers at those energies and leads\nto a pronounced absence of superlattice peaks in the reflectivity data. Our\nresults demonstrate the sensitivity of RXR to electronic reconstruction at the\natomic scale, and establish RXR as a powerful means of characterizing charge\ntransfer at buried oxide interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 20:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

These radio\nsources are called `mini-halos'. In order to understand their origin, which is\nstill unclear, joint radio and X-ray statistical studies of large cluster\nsamples are necessary to investigate the radio mini-halo properties and their\nconnection with the cluster thermodynamics. We here extend our previous\nexplorative study and investigate the perspectives offered by surveys in the\nradio continuum with LOFAR and SKA, in particular examining the effect of the\nintra-cluster magnetic field in the mini-halo region for the first time. By\nconsidering the minimum flux detectable in radio surveys and exploiting the\n$P_{radio}-L_X$ correlation observed for known mini-halos, we estimate the\ndetection limits achievable by future radio observational follow-up of X-ray\ncluster samples, such as HIFLUGCS and eROSITA. This allows us to estimate the\nmaximum number of radio mini-halos that can potentially be discovered in future\nsurveys as a function of redshift and magnetic field strength. We show that\nfuture radio surveys with LOFAR and SKA1 (at 140 MHz and 1.4 GHz) have the\npotential to discover ~1,000-10,000 radio mini-halo candidates up to redshift\nz=1. We further note that future SKA1 radio surveys at redshift z>0.6 will\nallow us to distinguish between different magnetic fields in the mini-halo\nregion, because higher magnetic fields are expected to produce more powerful\nmini-halos, thus implying a larger number of mini-halo detected at high\nredshift. For example, the non-detection with SKA1 of mini-halos at z>0.6 will\nsuggest a low magnetic field (B < few $\\mu$G). The synergy of these radio\nsurveys with future X-ray observations and theoretical studies is essential in\nestablishing the radio mini-halo physical nature.

Examples range from autonomous cars to implantable medical\ndevices, which are highly safety critical. Hybrid Automata (HA) based formal\napproach is gaining momentum for the specification and validation of CPS. HA\ncombines the model of the plant along with its discrete controller resulting in\na piece-wise continuous system with discontinuities. Accurate detection of\nthese discontinuities, using appropriate level crossing detectors, is a key\nchallenge to simulation of CPS based on HA. Existing techniques employ time\ndiscrete numerical integration with bracketing for level crossing detection.\nThese techniques involve back-tracking and are highly non-deterministic and\nhence error prone. As level crossings happen based on the values of continuous\nvariables, Quantized State System (QSS)- integration may be more suitable.\nExisting QSS integrators, based on fixed quanta, are also unsuitable for\nsimulating HAs. This is since the quantum selected is not dependent on the HA\nguard conditions, which are the main cause of discontinuities. Considering\nthis, we propose a new dynamic quanta based formal model called Quantized State\nHybrid Automata (QSHA). The developed formal model and the associated\nsimulation framework guarantees that (1) all level crossings are accurately\ndetected and (2) the time of the level crossing is also accurate within\nfloating point error bounds. Interestingly, benchmarking results reveal that\nthe proposed simulation technique takes 720, 1.33 and 4.41 times fewer\nsimulation steps compared to standard Quantized State System (QSS)-1,\nRunge-Kutta (RK)-45, and Differential Algebraic System Solver (DASSL)\nintegration based techniques respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 22:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-18"}

Unfortunately, the modern\nfabless business model of manufacturing hardware, while economic, leads to\ndeficiencies in security through the supply chain. In this paper, we illuminate\nthese security issues by introducing hardware Trojan attacks on neural\nnetworks, expanding the current taxonomy of neural network security to\nincorporate attacks of this nature. To aid in this, we develop a novel\nframework for inserting malicious hardware Trojans in the implementation of a\nneural network classifier.

Therefore, we\nintroduce the notion of guaranteeable delay which is the average delay plus\nthree standard deviations of the mean. We investigate the trade-off between\nguaranteeable delay and throughput for point-to-point wireless erasure links\nwith unreliable and delayed feedback, by bringing together signal flow\ntechniques to the area of coding. We use tiny codes, i.e. sliding window by\ncoding with just 2 packets, and design three variations of selective-repeat ARQ\nprotocols, by building on the baseline scheme, i.e. uncoded ARQ, developed by\nAusavapattanakun and Nosratinia: (i) Hybrid ARQ with soft combining at the\nreceiver; (ii) cumulative feedback-based ARQ without rate adaptation; and (iii)\nCoded ARQ with rate adaptation based on the cumulative feedback.

We show\nthat the ratio of image pixel distribution similarity across classes to within\nclasses is higher in our network's final layer compared to the input space.\nWhen we apply the linear support vector machine for image classification we see\nthat the accuracy is higher than if we were to train just the final layer of\nVGG16, ResNet18, and DenseNet40 with random weights. In the same setting we\ncompare it to an unsupervised feature learning method and find our accuracy to\nbe comparable on CIFAR10 but higher on CIFAR100 and STL10. We see that the\naccuracy is not far behind that of trained networks, particularly in the top-k\nsetting. For example the top-2 accuracy of our network is near 90% on both\nCIFAR10 and a 10-class mini ImageNet, and 85% on STL10. We find that k-nearest\nneighbor gives a comparable precision on the Corel Princeton Image Similarity\nBenchmark than if we were to use the final layer of trained networks. As with\nother networks we find that our network fails to a black box attack even though\nwe lack a gradient and use the sign activation. We highlight sensitivity of our\nnetwork to background as a potential pitfall and an advantage. Overall our work\npushes the boundary of what can be achieved with random weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 02:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 22:12:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 21:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Learning to\nrank has traditionally been studied in two settings. In the offline setting,\nrankers are typically learned from relevance labels created by judges. This\napproach has generally become standard in industrial applications of ranking,\nsuch as search. However, this approach lacks exploration and thus is limited by\nthe information content of the offline training data.

This property allowed Bugeaud to prove that\nthe irrationality exponents of the Thue-Morse-Mahler numbers are exactly 2.\nSince then, the Hankel determinants of several other automatic sequences, in\nparticular, the paperfolding sequence, the Stern sequence, the period-doubling\nsequence, are studied by Coons, Vrbik, Guo, Wu, Wen, Bugeaud, Fu, Han, Fokkink,\nKraaikamp, and Shallit. On the other hand, it is known that the Hankel\ndeterminants of a rational power series are ultimately zero, and the Hankel\ndeterminants of a quadratic power series over finite fields are ultimately\nperiodic. It is therefore natural to ask if we can obtain similar results about\nthe Hankel determinants of algebraic series.

A novel full-field k-imaging method with time-of-flight\nenergy detection allowed rapid recording of 4D (EB,k) data arrays (EB binding\nenergy; k final-state electron momentum) in the photon-energy range of\n400-1700eV. Arrays for the d-band complex of several transition metals (Mo, W,\nRe, Ir) reveal numerous spots of strong local intensity enhancement up to a\nfactor of 5. The enhancement is confined to small (EB,k)-regions (dk down to\n0.01 A-1; dEB down to 200 meV) and is a fingerprint of valence-band\nphotoelectron diffraction. Regions of constructive interference in the\n(EB,k)-scheme can be predicted in a manner resembling the Ewald construction. A\nkey factor is the transfer of photon momentum to the electron, which breaks the\nsymmetry and causes a rigid shift of the final-state energy isosphere.

The role of momentum conservation in Fermi's Golden Rule at X-ray\nenergies is revealed in a graphical, intuitive way.

In such a simulation, Geant4 is always responsible for the\nprimary particle generation and the interactions that occur in the non-gaseous\ndetector material. Garfield++ on the other hand always deals with the drift of\nions and electrons, amplification via electron avalanches and finally signal\ngeneration. For the ionizing interaction of particles with the gas, different\noptions and physics models exist. The present paper focuses on how to use\nGeant4, Garfield++ (including its Heed and SRIM interfaces) and Degrad to\ncreate the ionization electron-ion pairs in the gas. Software-wise, the\nproposed idea is to use the Geant4 physics parameterization feature, and to\nimplement a Garfield++ or Degrad based detector simulation as an external\nmodel. With a Degrad model, detailed simulations of the X-ray interaction in\ngaseous detectors, including shell absorption by photoelectric effect,\nsubsequent Auger cascade, shake-off and fluorescence emission, become possible.\nA simple Garfield++ model can be used for photons (Heed), heavy ions (SRIM) and\nrelativistic charged particles or MIPs (Heed). For non-relativistic charged\nparticles, more effort is required, and a combined Geant4/Garfield++ model must\nbe used. This model, the Geant4/Heed PAI model interface, uses the Geant4 PAI\nmodel in conjunction with the Heed PAI model. Parameters, such as the lower\nproduction cut of the Geant4 PAI model and the lowest electron energy limit\nhave to be set correctly. The paper demonstrates how to determine these\nparameters for certain values of the W parameter and Fano factor of the gas\nmixture. The simulation results of this Geant4/Heed PAI model interface are\nthen verified against the results obtained with the stand-alone software\npackages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 10:07:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 19:42:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 10:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

For image data, preprocessing typically involves a\nsequence of basic transformations such as cropping, filtering, rotating or\nflipping images. Currently, data scientists decide manually based on their\nexperience which transformations to apply in which particular order to a given\nimage data set. Besides constituting a bottleneck in real-world data science\nprojects, manual image data preprocessing may yield suboptimal results as data\nscientists need to rely on intuition or trial-and-error approaches when\nexploring the space of possible image transformations and thus might not be\nable to discover the most effective ones. To mitigate the inefficiency and\npotential ineffectiveness of manual data preprocessing, this paper proposes a\ndeep reinforcement learning framework to automatically discover the optimal\ndata preprocessing steps for training an image classifier. The framework takes\nas input sets of labeled images and predefined preprocessing transformations.\nIt jointly learns the classifier and the optimal preprocessing transformations\nfor individual images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not\nonly improves the accuracy of image classifiers, but also makes them\nsubstantially more robust to noisy inputs at test time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 10:15:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 17:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

The key role in this\napproach are the first integrals of the field equations. We start with the Lie\npoint symmetries and the first integrals defined by them, that is the Hojman\nintegrals. Subsequently we discuss the Noether point symmetries and the well\nknown method for deriving the Noether integrals. By means of the Inverse\nNoether Theorem we show that to every Hojman quadratic first integral one is\npossible to associate a Noether symmetry whose Noether integral is the original\nHojman integral. It is emphasized that the point transformation generating this\nNoether symmetry need not coincide with the point transformation defining the\nLie symmetry which produces the Hojman integral. We discuss the close\nconnection between the Lie point and the Noether point symmetries with the\ncollineations of the metric defined by the kinetic energy of the Lagrangian. In\nparticular the generators of Noether point symmetries are elements of the\nhomothetic algebra of that metric. The key point in the current study of\ncosmological models is the introduction of the mini superspace, that is the\nspace which is defined by the physical variables of the model, which is not the\nspacetime where the model evolves. The metric in the mini superspace is found\nfrom the kinematic part of the Lagrangian and we call it the kinetic metric.\nThe rest part of the Lagrangian is the effective potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 10:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-18"}

Although RANS models are\nwidely used, empiricism and large discrepancies between models reduce the\nreliability of simulating complex flows. Therefore, in recent years,\ndata-driven turbulence model has aroused widespread concern in fluid mechanics.\nBased on the experimental/numerical simulation results, this approach aims to\nmodify or construct the turbulence model for specific purposes by machine\nlearning technologies. In this paper, we take the results calculated by SA\nmodel as training data. Different from low Reynolds number turbulent flows, the\ndata from high Reynolds number flows shows an apparent scaling effect, thus\nleading to difficulties in the data-driven modeling. In order to improve the\nfitting accuracy, we divided the flow field into near-wall region, wake region,\nand far-field region, and built individual model for every region. In this\npaper, we adopted the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and some\nauxiliary optimization algorithms to reconstruct a mapping function between\nmean variables and the eddy viscosity. Since this model reflects the\nrelationship between local flow characteristics and turbulent eddy viscosity,\nit is independent on the airfoil shape and flow condition. The training data in\nthis paper is generated from only three subsonic flow calculations of NACA0012\nairfoil. By coupling the proposed approach with N-S equations, we calculated\nvarious flow cases as well as two different airfoils and showed the eddy\nviscosity contours, velocity profiles along the normal direction of wall and\nskin friction coefficient distributions, etc. Compared with the SA model, the\nresults show a reasonable accuracy and better efficiency, which indicates the\npositive prospect of data-driven methods in turbulence modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 11:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 02:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

With this purpose,\na simplified version of the proposed magnetic measurement system for LISA has\nbeen developed for a six-unit CubeSat, which will make it possible to improve\nthe technology readiness level (TRL) of the instrument.

Coordinated flows are fundamental to\npower deformations, required for migration or development, or to spread\nresources and signals. A ubiquitous mechanism to generate flows, particularly\nprominent in animals and amoeba, is acto-myosin cortex driven mechanical\ndeformations that pump the fluid enclosed by the cortex. Yet, it is unclear how\ncortex dynamics can self-organize to give rise to coordinated flows across the\nlargely varying scales of biological systems. Here, we develop a\nmechanochemical model of acto-myosin cortex mechanics coupled to a\ncontraction-triggering, soluble chemical. The chemical itself is advected with\nthe flows generated by the cortex driven deformations of the tubular-shaped\ncell. The theoretical model predicts a dynamic instability giving rise to\nstable patterns of cortex contraction waves and oscillatory flows.\nSurprisingly, simulated patterns extend beyond the intrinsic length scale of\nthe dynamic instability - scaling with system size instead. Patterns appear\nrandomly but can be robustly generated in a growing system or by\nflow-generating boundary conditions. We identify oscillatory flows as the key\nfor the scaling of contraction waves with system size. Our work shows the\nimportance of active flows in biophysical models of patterning, not only as a\nregulating input or an emergent output, but rather as a full part of a\nself-organized machinery. Contractions and fluid flows are observed in all\nkinds of organisms, so this concept is likely to be relevant for a broad class\nof systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 12:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

Indeed,\nmany questions in numerous application areas can be reduced to questions about\nflow networks.

We introduce Flow Logics: modal logics that treat flow\nfunctions as explicit first-order objects and enable the specification of rich\nproperties of flow networks. The syntax of our logic BFL* (Branching Flow\nLogic) is similar to the syntax of the temporal logic CTL*, except that atomic\nassertions may be flow propositions, like $> \\gamma$ or $\\geq \\gamma$, for\n$\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{N}$, which refer to the value of the flow in a vertex, and\nthat first-order quantification can be applied both to paths and to flow\nfunctions. We present an exhaustive study of the theoretical and practical\naspects of BFL*, as well as extensions and fragments of it. Our extensions\ninclude flow quantifications that range over non-integral flow functions or\nover maximal flow functions, path quantification that ranges over paths along\nwhich non-zero flow travels, past operators, and first-order quantification of\nflow values. We focus on the model-checking problem and show that it is\nPSPACE-complete, as it is for CTL*. Handling of flow quantifiers, however,\nincreases the complexity in terms of the network to ${\\rm P}^{\\rm NP}$, even\nfor the LFL and BFL fragments, which are the flow-counterparts of LTL and CTL.\nWe are still able to point to a useful fragment of BFL* for which the\nmodel-checking problem can be solved in polynomial time.

In the present communication, an alternative\nregime of propagation of reaction waves in a highly turbulent medium is\nintroduced and studied theoretically and numerically. More specifically,\npropagation of an infinitely thin reaction sheet in a turbulent medium is\nanalyzed, with molecular mixing of the reactant and product being allowed in\nwide layers. In this limiting case, an increase in the consumption velocity by\nturbulence is solely controlled by an increase in the reaction-sheet area.\nBased on physical reasoning and estimates, the area is hypothesized to be close\nto the mean area of an inert iso-scalar surface at the same turbulent Reynolds\nnumber. This hypothesis leads to a relation for the turbulent consumption\nvelocity, which is similar to the well-known Damk\\\"ohler scaling associated\ncommonly with distributed reaction zones at a low Da. The obtained theoretical\nresults are validated by analyzing a big database (23 cases characterized by\n0.01<Da<1) created recently in 3D direct numerical simulations of propagation\nof a statistically planar, one-dimensional, dynamically passive reaction wave\nin statistically stationary, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence.

In this paper,\nwe propose a real-time Ego-Lane Analysis System (ELAS) capable of estimating\nego-lane position, classifying LMTs and road markings, performing LDW and\ndetecting lane change events. The proposed vision-based system works on a\ntemporal sequence of images. Lane marking features are extracted in perspective\nand Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) images that are combined to increase\nrobustness. The final estimated lane is modeled as a spline using a combination\nof methods (Hough lines with Kalman filter and spline with particle filter).\nBased on the estimated lane, all other events are detected. To validate ELAS\nand cover the lack of lane datasets in the literature, a new dataset with more\nthan 20 different scenes (in more than 15,000 frames) and considering a variety\nof scenarios (urban road, highways, traffic, shadows, etc.) was created. The\ndataset was manually annotated and made publicly available to enable evaluation\nof several events that are of interest for the research community (i.e., lane\nestimation, change, and centering; road markings; intersections; LMTs;\ncrosswalks and adjacent lanes). ELAS achieved high detection rates in all\nreal-world events and proved to be ready for real-time applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 14:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-18"}

For elliptic\nPDEs with parameter-dependent coefficients, stochastic Galerkin finite element\nmethods (SGFEMs) have been well studied. Under certain assumptions, it can be\nshown that there exists a sequence of SGFEM approximation spaces for which the\nenergy norm of the error decays to zero at a rate that is independent of the\nnumber of input parameters. However, it is not clear how to adaptively\nconstruct these spaces in a practical and computationally efficient way. We\npresent a new adaptive SGFEM algorithm that tackles elliptic PDEs with\nparameter-dependent coefficients quickly and efficiently. We consider\napproximation spaces with a multilevel structure---where each solution mode is\nassociated with a finite element space on a potentially different mesh---and\nuse an implicit a posteriori error estimation strategy to steer the adaptive\nenrichment of the space. At each step, the components of the error estimator\nare used to assess the potential benefits of a variety of enrichment\nstrategies, including whether or not to activate more parameters. No marking or\ntuning parameters are required. Numerical experiments for a selection of test\nproblems demonstrate that the new method performs optimally in that it\ngenerates a sequence of approximations for which the estimated energy error\ndecays to zero at the same rate as the error for the underlying finite element\nmethod applied to the associated parameter-free problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 14:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-18"}

To address this problem, we teach image captioning models new\nvisual concepts from labeled images and object detection datasets. Since image\nlabels and object classes can be interpreted as partial captions, we formulate\nthis problem as learning from partially-specified sequence data. We then\npropose a novel algorithm for training sequence models, such as recurrent\nneural networks, on partially-specified sequences which we represent using\nfinite state automata. In the context of image captioning, our method lifts the\nrestriction that previously required image captioning models to be trained on\npaired image-sentence corpora only, or otherwise required specialized model\narchitectures to take advantage of alternative data modalities. Applying our\napproach to an existing neural captioning model, we achieve state of the art\nresults on the novel object captioning task using the COCO dataset.

Given such a Gramian, it can\nbe determined whether or not the tight frame is projective group frame, i.e.,\nis the projective orbit of some group $G$ (which may not be unique). On the\nother hand, there is complete description of the projective group frames in\nterms of the irreducible projective representations of $G$. Here we consider\nthe inverse problem of taking the Gramian of a projective group frame for a\ngroup $G$, and identifying the cocycle and constructing the frame explicitly as\nthe projective group orbit of a vector $v$ (decomposed in terms of the\nirreducibles). The key idea is to recognise that the Gramian is a group matrix\ngiven by a vector $f\\in\\mathbb{C}^G$, and to take the Fourier transform of $f$\nto obtain the components of $v$ as orthogonal projections. This requires the\ndevelopment of a theory of group matrices and the Fourier transform for\nprojective representations. Of particular interest, we give a block\ndiagonalisation of (projective) group matrices. This leads to a unique Fourier\ndecomposition of the group matrices, and a further fine-scale decomposition\ninto low rank group matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 21:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

After analyzing the source of the\nproblem, we find that the electromagnetic 4-potential depends on the local\nreference frame instead of the global reference frame. The transformation of\nthe local reference frame is the intrinsic degree of freedom of the\nelectromagnetic field. Therefore, considering only the Lorentz transformation\nof the global reference frame and neglecting the Lorentz transformation of the\nlocal reference frame may lead to the noncovariance of the electromagnetic\n4-potential. Accordingly, we redescribe these difficulties of the\nelectromagnetic field from the perspective of quantum field theory.

When multiple photons arrive within a single\nrepetition period of the illuminating laser, the SPAD records only the arrival\nof the first photon; this leads to a bias in the recorded light transient\nwherein the transient response at later time-instants are under-estimated. An\nunfortunate consequence of this is the need to operate the illumination at\nlow-power levels to reduce the probability of multiple photons returning in a\nsingle period. Operating the laser at low power results in either low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the measured transients or reduced frame rate\ndue to longer exposure durations to achieve a high SNR. In this paper, we\npropose a signal processing-based approach to compensate pile-up in\npost-processing, thereby enabling high power operation of the illuminating\nlaser.

In\nthe era of Big Data, information is being generated at a fast pace, and\nanalyzing the same is a challenge. Various methods have been proposed to speed\nup the analysis of the data and also mining it for information. All of this\noften involves using a massive array of compute nodes, and transmitting the\ndata over the network. Of course, with the huge quantity of data, this poses a\nmajor issue to the task of gathering intelligence from data. Therefore, in\norder to address such issues with Big Data, using data compression techniques\nis a viable option. Since graphs represent most real world data, methods to\ncompress graphs have been in the forefront of such endeavors. In this paper we\npropose techniques to compress graphs by finding specific patterns and\nreplacing those with identifiers that are of variable length, an idea inspired\nby Huffman Coding. Specifically, given a graph G = (V, E), where V is the set\nof vertices and E is the set of edges, and |V| = n, we propose methods to\nreduce the space requirements of the graph by compressing the adjacency\nrepresentation of the same. The proposed methods show up to 80% reduction is\nthe space required to store the graphs as compared to using the adjacency\nmatrix. The methods can also be applied to other representations as well.
