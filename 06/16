Conventional\nfar-end crosstalk (FEXT) based cancellers falter in the upstream transmission\nof this emerging G.fast system. In this paper, we propose a novel differential\nevolution algorithm (DEA) aided turbo channel estimation (CE) and multi-user\ndetection (MUD) scheme for the G.fast upstream including the frequency band up\nto 212 MHz, which is capable of approaching the optimal Cramer-Rao lower bound\nof the channel estimate, whilst approaching the optimal maximum likelihood (ML)\nMUD's performance associated with perfect channel state information, and yet\nonly imposing about 5% of its computational complexity. Explicitly, the turbo\nconcept is exploited by iteratively exchanging information between the\ncontinuous value-based DEA assisted channel estimator and the discrete\nvalue-based DEA MUD. Our extensive simulations show that 18 dB normalized mean\nsquare error gain is attained by the channel estimator and 10 dB\nsignal-to-noise ratio gain can be achieved by the MUD upon exploiting this\niteration gain. We also quantify the influence of the CE error, of the copper\nlength and of the impulse noise.

More recently, the analysis of two large stellar surveys have\nrevealed the presence of a well-populated chemical elemental abundance\nsequence, of two distinct sequences in the colour-magnitude diagram, and of a\nprominent slightly retrograde kinematic structure all in the nearby halo, which\nmay trace an important accretion event experienced by the Galaxy.

As a result, the\nuniformly ordered phase is replaced by modulated (multi-domain) phases,\ncharacterized by different order parameters rather than the global\nmagnetization. The transitions occurring within those modulated phases and\ntowards the disordered phase are generally not of second-order type.\nNevertheless, strong experimental evidence indicates that a standard critical\nbehavior is recovered when comparatively small fields are applied that\nstabilize the uniform phase. The resulting power laws are observed with respect\nto a putative critical point that falls in the portion of the phase diagram\noccupied by modulated phases, in line with an avoided-criticality scenario.\nHere we propose a generalization of the scaling hypothesis for ferromagnets,\nwhich explains this observation assuming that the dipolar interaction acts as a\nrelevant field, in the sense of renormalization group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 17:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Despite\nthis, there still remain important metrics for which we do not have fair\nclassifiers and many of the aforementioned algorithms do not come with\ntheoretical guarantees; perhaps because the resulting optimization problem is\nnon-convex. The main contribution of this paper is a new meta-algorithm for\nclassification that takes as input a large class of fairness constraints, with\nrespect to multiple non-disjoint sensitive attributes, and which comes with\nprovable guarantees. This is achieved by first developing a meta-algorithm for\na large family of classification problems with convex constraints, and then\nshowing that classification problems with general types of fairness constraints\ncan be reduced to those in this family. We present empirical results that show\nthat our algorithm can achieve near-perfect fairness with respect to various\nfairness metrics, and that the loss in accuracy due to the imposed fairness\nconstraints is often small.

The\ngalaxy distribution is constructed using a statistical treatment of\nspectroscopic and photometric redshifts. We identify a proto-supercluster,\ndubbed \"Hyperion\" for its immense size and mass, which extends over a volume of\n~60x60x150 comoving Mpc^3 and has an estimated total mass of ~4.8x 10^15 M_sun.\nThis immensely complex structure contains at least 7 density peaks within 2.4 <\nz < 2.5, connected by filaments.

Although currently not detected, exomoons could be orbiting some of\nthese CBPs, and they might be suitable for harboring life. A necessary\ncondition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical\nstability. Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler\nCBPs using numerical $N$-body integrations. We determine regions of stability\nand obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial\nexolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial\ninclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the\norbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,\nfor most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location\nof the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of\nthe moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the\nbinary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and\nwhich is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations. For high inclinations,\nthe evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons\nin dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering\nstrong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct\ncollisions. This suggests that there is a dearth of highly-inclined exomoons\naround the Kepler CBPs, whereas coplanar exomoons are dynamically allowed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 11:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

It\nis open if these techniques can go beyond homogeneity, and in this paper we\nmake some progress in this direction by considering depth-4 circuits of low\nalgebraic rank, which are a natural extension of homogeneous depth-4 circuits.\nA depth-4 circuit is a representation of an $N$-variate, degree-$n$ polynomial\n$P$ as \\[ P = \\sum_{i = 1}^T Q_{i1}\\cdot Q_{i2}\\cdot \\cdots \\cdot Q_{it} \\; ,\n\\] where the $Q_{ij}$ are given by their monomial expansion. Homogeneity adds\nthe constraint that for every $i \\in [T]$, $\\sum_{j} \\operatorname{deg}(Q_{ij})\n= n$. We study an extension, where, for every $i \\in [T]$, the algebraic rank\nof the set $\\{Q_{i1}, Q_{i2}, \\ldots ,Q_{it}\\}$ of polynomials is at most some\nparameter $k$. Already for $k = n$, these circuits are a generalization of the\nclass of homogeneous depth-4 circuits, where in particular $t \\leq n$ (and\nhence $k \\leq n$).\n  We study lower bounds and polynomial identity tests for such circuits and\nprove the following results. We show an $\\exp{(\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}\\log N))}$ lower\nbound for such circuits for an explicit $N$ variate degree $n$ polynomial\nfamily when $k \\leq n$. We also show quasipolynomial hitting sets when the\ndegree of each $Q_{ij}$ and the $k$ are at most $\\operatorname{poly}(\\log n)$.\n  A key technical ingredient of the proofs, which may be of independent\ninterest, is a result which states that over any field of characteristic zero,\nup to a translation, every polynomial in a set of polynomials can be written as\na function of the polynomials in a transcendence basis of the set.

This event is located at\na low Galactic latitude in the survey area that is currently planned for NASA's\nWFIRST exoplanet microlensing survey.

From quantum\nentanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify\na desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and\nidentify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly,\nQRTs revolutionize the way we think about familiar properties of physical\nsystems like entanglement, elevating them from just being interesting from a\nfundamental point of view to being useful in performing practical tasks. The\nbasic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states\ninto two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of\nresource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free\nquantum operations arising from natural restrictions on physical systems, and\nthat consists of all the physical processes allowed by the resource theory and\nwhich acts invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what\ninformation processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations.\nDespite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free\noperations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of\nresource measures and resource convertibility.

For example, cardiovascular\ndisease death is a competing event for prostate cancer death because an\nindividual cannot die of prostate cancer once he has died of cardiovascular\ndisease. Various statistical estimands have been defined as possible targets of\ninference in the classical competing risks literature. Many reviews have\ndescribed these statistical estimands and their estimating procedures with\nrecommendations about their use. However, this previous work has not used a\nformal framework for characterizing causal effects and their identifying\nconditions, which makes it difficult to interpret effect estimates and assess\nrecommendations regarding analytic choices. Here we use a counterfactual\nframework to explicitly define each of these classical estimands. We clarify\nthat, depending on whether competing events are defined as censoring events,\ncontrasts of risks can define a total effect of the treatment on the event of\ninterest, or a direct effect of the treatment on the event of interest not\nmediated through the competing event.

For small batch an increase in batch size results in the\nproportional reduction in the training time, a phenomenon known as linear\nscaling. However, increasing batch size beyond a certain value leads to no\nfurther improvement in training time. In this paper we develop the first\nanalytical framework that extends linear scaling to match the parallel\ncomputing capacity of a resource. The framework is designed for a class of\nclassical kernel machines. It automatically modifies a standard kernel machine\nto output a mathematically equivalent prediction function, yet allowing for\nextended linear scaling, i.e., higher effective parallelization and faster\ntraining time on given hardware.\n  The resulting algorithms are accurate, principled and very fast.

BaRC is\ngeneral, in that it can accelerate training of any model-free RL algorithm on a\nbroad class of goal-directed continuous control MDPs. Its curriculum strategy\nis physically intuitive, easy-to-tune, and allows incorporating physical priors\nto accelerate training without hindering the performance, flexibility, and\napplicability of the model-free RL algorithm.

However, their development is limited by\nmany requirements and challenges, such as the use of safe materials, size\nrestrictions, safe and efficient powering, and selection of suitable wireless\ncommunication technologies. Some of the proposed wireless communication\ntechnologies are the terahertz (THz) radio frequency (RF), and ultrasound. This\npaper investigates the use of {\\em magnetic induction-based backscatter\ncommunication} as an alternative technology. In particular, the goal is to\nprovide a practical design for a micro-scale IMD, referred to as a \"biomote\"\nhere, that can communicate with a wearable or handheld device such as a cell\nphone, tablet, or smart watch.First, it is demonstrated that communication via\nmagnetic induction can be established between a biomote and such an external\nreader. Then, low-power modulation and error-correction coding schemes that can\nbe implemented in micro-scale are explored for the mote. With the aim of\nincreasing reliability and accuracy of measurements through mass deployment of\nbiomotes, suitable low-power media access control (MAC) schemes are proposed,\nand the feasibility of their implementation in micro-scale is highlighted.\nNext, assuming that the human body is an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\nchannel, the performance of the mote is simulated and analyzed. Results of this\nanalysis asserts that a communication range of at least few centimeters is\nachievable with an acceptable bit error rate. Finally, from the analysis of the\nMAC schemes, the optimum number of motes to be deployed for various read delays\nand transmission rates is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 01:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

It has been applied to numerous domains, such as data\naugmentation, domain adaptation, and unsupervised training. When paired\ntraining data is not accessible, image translation becomes an ill-posed\nproblem. We constrain the problem with the assumption that the translated image\nneeds to be perceptually similar to the original image and also appears to be\ndrawn from the new domain, and propose a simple yet effective image translation\nmodel consisting of a single generator trained with a self-regularization term\nand an adversarial term. We further notice that existing image translation\ntechniques are agnostic to the subjects of interest and often introduce\nunwanted changes or artifacts to the input. Thus we propose to add an attention\nmodule to predict an attention map to guide the image translation process. The\nmodule learns to attend to key parts of the image while keeping everything else\nunaltered, essentially avoiding undesired artifacts or changes. The predicted\nattention map also opens door to applications such as unsupervised segmentation\nand saliency detection.

The\ntask is challenging due to the facts that (1) training images with ground-truth\nlabels are difficult to obtain, and (2) variations among different subordinate\ncategories are subtle. It is well established that characterizing features of\ndifferent subordinate categories are located on local parts of object\ninstances. In fact, careful part annotations are available in many fine-grained\ncategorization datasets. However, manually annotating object parts requires\nexpertise, which is also difficult to generalize to new fine-grained\ncategorization tasks. In this work, we propose a Weakly Supervised Part\nDetection Network (PartNet) that is able to detect discriminative local parts\nfor use of fine-grained categorization. A vanilla PartNet builds on top of a\nbase subnetwork two parallel streams of upper network layers, which\nrespectively compute scores of classification probabilities (over subordinate\ncategories) and detection probabilities (over a specified number of\ndiscriminative part detectors) for local regions of interest (RoIs). The\nimage-level prediction is obtained by aggregating element-wise products of\nthese region-level probabilities. To generate a diverse set of RoIs as inputs\nof PartNet, we propose a simple Discretized Part Proposals module (DPP) that\ndirectly targets for proposing candidates of discriminative local parts, with\nno bridging via object-level proposals.

This\nprocedure has the merit that any existing control method that has been\ndeveloped in Euclidean space can be applied globally to systems defined on\nnonlinear manifolds, thus making nonlinear controller design on manifolds\neasier. The detail of the method is demonstrated on the fully actuated rigid\nbody system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 11:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

Hence, the \"aging\" of the received\ninformation can be interpreted as a procedure that the above mutual information\nreduces as the age grows. In addition, we consider a sampling problem, where\nsamples of a Markov source are taken and sent through a queue to the receiver.\nIn order to optimize the freshness of information, we study the optimal\nsampling policy that maximizes the time-average expected mutual information. We\nprove that the optimal sampling policy is a threshold policy and find the\noptimal threshold exactly. Specifically, a new sample is taken once a\nconditional mutual information term reduces to a threshold, and the threshold\nis equal to the optimum value of the time-average expected mutual information\nthat is being maximized. Numerical results are provided to compare different\nsampling policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 13:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

However, occasionally\neven the best method fails due to low image quality, artifacts or unexpected\nbehaviour of black box algorithms. Being able to predict segmentation quality\nin the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice,\nbut also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in\nsubsequent analysis.\n  In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality\ncontrol for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning. First, we\ntrain a neural network on 12,880 samples to predict Dice Similarity\nCoefficients (DSC) on a per-case basis. We report a mean average error (MAE) of\n0.03 on 1,610 test samples and 97% binary classification accuracy for\nseparating low and high quality segmentations. Secondly, in the scenario where\nno manually annotated data is available, we train a network to predict DSC\nscores from estimated quality obtained via a reverse testing strategy. We\nreport an MAE=0.14 and 91% binary classification accuracy for this case.\nPredictions are obtained in real-time which, when combined with real-time\nsegmentation methods, enables instant feedback on whether an acquired scan is\nanalysable while the patient is still in the scanner. This further enables new\napplications of optimising image acquisition towards best possible analysis\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 13:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

Our model contains a kinetic\nterm of the scalar field minimally coupled to the background geometry without a\npotential term. The matter content of the model consists of a perfect fluid\nplus a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ as a separate source. In the framework\nof a local dynamical system analysis, we show that in the absence or presence\nof $\\Lambda$, depending on some adopted values for the free parameters of the\nunderlying cosmological model with flat and non-flat spatial geometries, one\ngets some static solutions which are viable under classical linear\nperturbations.
