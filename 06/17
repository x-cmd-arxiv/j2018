We introduce a \\textit{simple} and \\textit{budget\nefficient} crowdsourcing method named Proxy Crowdsourcing (PCS). PCS collects\nanswers from two sets of workers: \\textit{leaders} (a.k.a proxies) and\n\\textit{followers}. Each leader completely answers the survey while each\nfollower answers only a small subset of it. We then weigh every leader\naccording to the number of followers to which his answer are closest, and\naggregate the answers of the leaders using any standard aggregation method\n(e.g., Plurality for categorical labels or Mean for continuous labels). We\ncompare empirically the performance of PCS to unweighted aggregation, keeping\nthe total number of questions (the budget) fixed. We show that PCS improves the\naccuracy of aggregated answers across several datasets, both with categorical\nand continuous labels. Overall, our suggested method improves accuracy while\nbeing simple and easy to implement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 16:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

In general, BAMs\ndefines resource restrictions by class and allocate the available resources on\ndemand. This is frequently necessary to manage large and complex systems like\nrouting networks. GBAM is a new generalized BAM that, by configuration,\nincorporates the behavior of existing BAMs (MAM, RDM, G-RDM and\nAllocTC-Sharing). In effect, any current available BAM behavior is reproduced\nby G-BAM by simply adjusting its configuration parameters. This paper focuses\non investigating the applicability of using autonomy together with Bandwidth\nAllocation Models (BAMs) for improve performance and facilitating the\nmanagement of MPLS DS-TE networks.

In many applications training\ntakes place without prior knowledge of the testing distribution on which the\nalgorithm will be applied in the future.

The global balancing model\nconstructs balancing weights that facilitate estimating of partial effects of\nfeatures (holding fixed all other features), a problem that is challenging in\nhigh dimensions, and thus helps to identify stable, causal relationships\nbetween features and outcomes.

The\nuplink information transfer is carried out by using power-domain multiplexing,\nand the receiver decodes each UE's data in such a way that the UE with the best\nchannel gain is decoded without interference. In order to determine optimal\nresource allocation strategies, we formulate optimization problems considering\ntwo models, namely half-duplex and asynchronous transmission, based on how\ndownlink and uplink operations are coordinated. In both cases, we have\nconcave-linear fractional problems, and hence Dinkelbach's method can be\napplied to obtain the globally optimal solutions. Thus, we first derive\nanalytical expressions for the harvesting interval, and then we provide an\nalgorithm to describe the complete procedure.

In this position paper, we present a context analysis describing the\nphysical constraints, performance objectives, and traffic characteristics of\nthe on-chip communication paradigm. We summarize the main differences with\nrespect to traditional wireless scenarios, to then discuss their implications\non the design of MAC protocols for manycore WNoCs, with the ultimate goal of\nkickstarting this arguably unexplored research area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 21:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

We find that during the quasi-static evolution,\nprominence/filament condensations of an elongated, sigmoid morphology form in\nthe dips of the significantly twisted field lines of the emerged flux rope due\nto run-away radiative cooling. A prominence cavity also forms surrounding the\nprominence, which is best observed above the limb with the line-of-sight nearly\nalong the length of the flux rope, as shown by synthetic SDO/AIA EUV images.\nThe magnetic field supporting the prominence is significantly non-force-free\ndespite the low plasma-beta.

Words are usually\nmanually annotated with their sememes by linguists, and form linguistic\ncommon-sense knowledge bases widely used in various NLP tasks. Recently, the\nlexical sememe prediction task has been introduced. It consists of\nautomatically recommending sememes for words, which is expected to improve\nannotation efficiency and consistency. However, existing methods of lexical\nsememe prediction typically rely on the external context of words to represent\nthe meaning, which usually fails to deal with low-frequency and\nout-of-vocabulary words. To address this issue for Chinese, we propose a novel\nframework to take advantage of both internal character information and external\ncontext information of words. We experiment on HowNet, a Chinese sememe\nknowledge base, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines by a large margin, and maintains a robust performance even for\nlow-frequency words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 08:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

Many S0s do not host\nprominent bulges. S0 galaxies have a broad distribution of bulge-to-total\nratios ($B/T$) and S\\'ersic indices ($n$), with average values of\n$B/T=0.34\\pm0.15$ and $n=2.62\\pm1.02$, qualitatively consistent with the notion\nthat S0s define a parallel sequence with and may have evolved from spiral\ngalaxies. This is further reinforced by the incidence of bars and lenses in\nS0s, which when compared with the statistics in spirals, supports the idea that\nlenses are demised bars. However, despite their wide range of prominence, the\nbulges of S0s form a surprisingly uniform sequence on both the Kormendy and\nfundamental plane relations. There is no evidence for population dichotomy or\nother indications of differentiation into classical and pseudo bulges. Most of\nthe S0s reside in the field and in groups; cluster environment is not a\nnecessary condition for S0 production. The properties of S0 bulges show little\ncorrelation with environmental indicators, after the dependence of galaxy\nstellar mass on environment is taken into account. As the bulges of late-type\nspirals and S0s are intrinsically different, and environmental effects that may\naccount for such evolution appear to be minimal, we conclude that late-type\nspirals are not plausible progenitors of S0s. The bulges of S0s likely formed\nat an early epoch, after which secular processes contributed little to their\nsubsequent evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 08:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

We suggest that crack nucleation occurred near\nthe basal plane of primary alpha grains by the subsurface double-ended pile-up\nmechanism first conceived by Tanaka and Mura. Superjogs on the basal <a>\ndislocations were observed near the crack nucleation location. The two phase\nregions showed direct transmission of a3 dislocations between secondary alpha\nplates, transmitted through the beta ligaments as a[010], which then decompose\ninto (a/2)<111> dislocation networks in the beta. The beta ligaments themselves\ndo not appear to form an especially impenetrable barrier to slip, in agreement\nwith the micropillar and crystal plasticity investigations of Zhang et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 11:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

Here, we combine Galactic models (for |b|<10\ndeg) and simulations of LSST observations to study how different observing\nstrategies affect the number and properties of microlensing events detected by\nLSST. We predict that LSST will mostly observe long duration microlensing\nevents due to the source stars with the averaged magnitude around 22 in r-band,\nrather than high-magnification events due to fainter source stars. In Galactic\nbulge fields, LSST should detect on the order of 400 microlensing events per\nsquare degree as compared to 15 in disk fields. Improving the cadence increases\nthe number of detectable microlensing events, e.g., improving the cadence from\n6 to 2 days approximately doubles the number of microlensing events throughout\nthe Galaxy. According to the current LSST strategy, it will observe some fields\n900 times during a 10-year survey with the average cadence of ~4-days (I) and\nother fields (mostly toward the Galactic disk) around 180 times during a 1-year\nsurvey only with the average 1-day cadence (II).

Late-gadolinium enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance\n(LGE-CMR) is a non-invasive method that may also be used to detect gaps, but it\nis currently a time-consuming process, prone to high inter-observer\nvariability. In this paper, we present a method to semi-automatically identify\nand quantify ablation gaps. Gap quantification is performed through minimum\npath search in a graph where every node is a scar patch and the edges are the\ngeodesic distances between patches. We propose the Relative Gap Measure (RGM)\nto estimate the percentage of gap around a vein, which is defined as the ratio\nof the overall gap length and the total length of the path that encircles the\nvein. Additionally, an advanced version of the RGM has been developed to\nintegrate gap quantification estimates from different scar segmentation\ntechniques into a single figure-of-merit. Population-based statistical and\nregional analysis of gap distribution was performed using a standardised\nparcellation of the left atrium. We have evaluated our method on synthetic and\nclinical data from 50 AF patients who underwent PVI with radiofrequency\nablation. The population-based analysis concluded that the left superior PV is\nmore prone to lesion gaps while the left inferior PV tends to have less gaps\n(p<0.05 in both cases), in the processed data. This type of information can be\nvery useful for the optimization and objective assessment of PVI interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 14:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

Prediction of the\nprotein secondary structure is a crucial intermediate step towards elucidating\nits 3D structure and function. Traditional experimental methods for prediction\nof protein structure are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, various\nmachine learning approaches have been proposed to predict the protein secondary\nstructure.

However, the broadcast nature of air-to-ground line-of-sight\nwireless chan- nels brings a new challenge to the information security of UAV-\nground communication. This paper tackles such a challenge in the physical layer\nby exploiting the mobility of UAV via its trajectory design. We consider a\nUAV-ground communication system with multiple potential eavesdroppers on the\nground, where the information on the locations of the eavesdroppers is\nimperfect.

We propose an iterative suboptimal algorithm to solve this problem\nefficiently by applying the block coordinate descent method, S-procedure, and\nsuccessive convex optimization method.
