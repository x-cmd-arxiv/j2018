However, the\ngeometric mean has a serious limitation in comparison with the arithmetic mean.\nMeans are used to summarize the information in a large set of values in a\nsingle number; yet, the geometric mean of a data set with at least one zero is\nalways zero. As a result, the geometric mean does not capture any information\nabout the non-zero values. The purpose of this short contribution is to review\nsolutions proposed in the literature that enable the computation of the\ngeometric mean of data sets containing zeros and to show that they do not\nfulfil the `recovery' or `monotonicity' conditions that we define. The standard\ngeometric mean should be recovered from the modified geometric mean if the data\nset does not contain any zeros (recovery condition). Also, if the values of an\nordered data set are greater one by one than the values of another data set\nthen the modified geometric mean of the first data set must be greater than the\nmodified geometric mean of the second data set (monotonicity condition). We\nthen formulate a modified version of the geometric mean that can handle zeros\nwhile satisfying both desired conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 16:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 14:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

The society of visual\ntracking, however, still needs to deal with the following difficulty on CF\ntrackers: avoiding or eliminating the boundary effect completely, in the\nmeantime, exploiting non-linear kernels and running efficiently. In this paper,\nwe propose a fast kernelized correlation filter without boundary effect\n(nBEKCF) to solve this problem. To avoid the boundary effect thoroughly, a set\nof \\emph{real} and \\emph{dense} patches is sampled through the traditional\nsliding window and used as the training samples to train nBEKCF to fit a\nGaussian response map. Non-linear kernels can be applied naturally in nBEKCF\ndue to its different theoretical foundation from the existing CF trackers'. To\nachieve the fast training and detection, a set of cyclic bases is introduced to\nconstruct the filter. Two algorithms, ACSII and CCIM, are developed to\nsignificantly accelerate the calculation of kernel correlation matrices. ACSII\nand CCIM fully exploit the density of training samples and cyclic structure of\nbases, and totally run in space domain. The efficiency of CCIM exceeds that of\nthe FFT counterpart remarkably in our task. Extensive experiments on six public\ndatasets, OTB-2013, OTB-2015, NfS, VOT2018, GOT10k, and TrackingNet, show that\ncompared to the CF trackers designed to relax the boundary effect, BACF and\nSRDCF, our nBEKCF achieves higher localization accuracy without tricks, in the\nmeanwhile, runs at higher FPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 16:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 07:14:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 08:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 04:09:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 01:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

Effective mmWave\ncommunications require fast and reliable methods for beamforming at both the\nUser Equipment (UE) and the Base Station (BS) sides, in order to achieve a\nsufficiently large Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) after beamforming. We refer to\nthe problem of finding a pair of strongly coupled narrow beams at the\ntransmitter and receiver as the Beam Alignment (BA) problem. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient BA scheme for single-carrier mmWave communications. In the\nproposed scheme, the BS periodically probes the channel in the downlink via a\npre-specified pseudo-random beamforming codebook and pseudo-random spreading\ncodes, letting each UE estimate the Angle-of-Arrival / Angle-of-Departure\n(AoA-AoD) pair of the multipath channel for which the energy transfer is\nmaximum. We leverage the sparse nature of mmWave channels in the AoA-AoD domain\nto formulate the BA problem as the estimation of a sparse non-negative vector.\nBased on the recently developed Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) technique, we\nefficiently find the strongest AoA-AoD pair connecting each UE to the BS. We\nevaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under a realistic channel\nmodel, where the propagation channel consists of a few multipath scattering\ncomponents each having different delays, AoAs-AoDs, and Doppler shifts.The\nchannel model parameters are consistent with experimental channel measurements.\nSimulation results indicate that the proposed method is highly robust to fast\nchannel variations caused by the large Doppler spread between the multipath\ncomponents. Furthermore, we also show that after achieving BA the beamformed\nchannel is essentially frequency-flat, such that single-carrier communication\nneeds no equalization in the time domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 18:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

Free-free (thermal) radio\ncontinuum emission is associated with these jets. This emission is relatively\nweak and compact, and sensitive radio interferometers are required to study it.\nObservations in the cm range are most useful to trace the base of the ionized\njets, close to the central protostar, where optical or near-IR imaging is made\ndifficult by the high extinction present. Radio recombination lines in jets (in\ncombination with proper motions) should provide their 3D kinematics at very\nsmall scale. Future instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and\nthe Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will be crucial to perform this\nkind of sensitive observations. Thermal jets are associated with both high and\nlow mass protostars and possibly even with substellar objects. The ionizing\nmechanism of these radio jets appears to be related to shocks in the associated\noutflows, as suggested by the observed correlation between the cm luminosity\nand the outflow momentum rate. Some protostellar jets show indications of\nnon-thermal emission in their lobes. Linearly polarized synchrotron emission\nhas been found in the jet of HH 80-81, allowing one to map the jet magnetic\nfield, a key ingredient to determine the collimation and ejection mechanisms.\nAs only a fraction of the emission is polarized, very sensitive observations\nsuch as those that will be feasible with the interferometers previously\nmentioned are required to perform studies in a large sample of sources. Jets\nare present in many kinds of astrophysical scenarios. Characterizing radio jets\nin young stars, where thermal emission allows one to determine their physical\nconditions, would also be useful in understanding acceleration and collimation\nmechanisms in all kinds of astrophysical jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 20:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

A duty ratio $D$ is a fraction of time that the stator\nand the rotor interact and is a fundamental property to characterize the motor\nbut remains to be determined. It is known that the stator units of the motor\nbind to and dissociate from the motor dynamically to control the motor torque\ndepending on the load on the motor. At low load where the kinetics such as a\nproton translocation speed limits the rotation rate, the dependency of the\nrotation rate on the number of stator units $N$ infers $D$; the dependency\nbecomes larger for smaller $D$. Contradicting observations supporting both the\nsmall and large $D$ have been reported. A dilemma is that it is difficult to\nexplore a broad range of $N$ at low load because the stator units easily\ndissociate, and $N$ is limited to one or two at vanishing load.

In practice, a well-informed Indian citizen can\nescape censorship through a judicious choice of service provider. We then\nconsider the question of whether India might potentially follow the Chinese\nmodel and institute a single, government-controlled filter. This would not be\ndifficult, as the Indian Internet is quite centralized already. A few \"key\"\nASes (approx 1% of Indian ASes) collectively intercept approx 95% of paths to\nthe censored sites we sample in our study, and also to all publicly-visible DNS\nservers. 5,000 routers spanning these key ASes would suffice to carry out IP or\nDNS filtering for the entire country; approx 70% of these routers belong to\nonly two private ISPs. If the government is willing to employ more powerful\nmeasures, such as an IP Prefix Hijacking attack, any one of several key ASes\ncan censor traffic for nearly all Indian users.

By\nappealing to a statistical framework, we find that fundamental-mode classical\nCepheid Period--Luminosity relations are non-linear around 10--18 days at\noptical and near-IR wavelengths. We also suggest that a non-linear relation\nprovides a better constraint on the Cepheid Period--Luminosity relation in type\nIa Supernovae host galaxies, though it has a negligible effect on the\nsystematic uncertainties affecting the local measurement of the Hubble\nconstant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 07:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Thus improvements of\nthe foreground analysis are necessary. As revealed\nin~\\cite{2018arXiv180410382L}, the E-mode and B-mode of the polarized\nforeground have noticeable different properties, both in morphology and\nfrequency spectrum, suggesting that they arise from different physical\nprocesses, and need to be studied separately.\n  Aims: I will study the polarized emission from Galactic loops, especially\nLoop I, and mainly focus on the following issues: Does it contribute\npredominantly to the E-mode or B-mode? In which frequency bands and in which\nsky regions can it be identified?\n  Methods: Based on a well known result about the magnetic field alignment in\nsupernova explosions, a theoretical expectation is established that the loop\npolarizations should be predominantly E-mode. In particular, the expected\npolarization angles of Loop I are compared with those from the real microwave\nband data of WMAP and Planck.\n  Results and conclusions: The comparison between model and data shows\nremarkable consistency between data and expectation at all bands and for a\nlarge area of the sky. This result suggests that the polarized emission of\nGalactic Loop I is a major polarized component in all microwave bands from 23\nto 353 GHz, and a considerable part of the polarized foreground is likely\noriginated from a local bubble associated with Loop I, instead of the far more\ndistant Galactic emission.

To cope with the massive amount of computation needed for such\ncomplex CNNs, the latest solutions utilize blocking of an image over the\navailable dimensions and batching of multiple input images to improve data\nreuse in the memory hierarchy. While there has been numerous works on\nmaximizing data reuse, only a few studies have focused on the memory bottleneck\ncaused by limited bandwidth. Bandwidth bottleneck can easily occur in CNN\nacceleration as CNN layers have different sizes with varying computation needs\nand as batching is typically performed over each CNN layer for an ideal data\nreuse. In this case, the data transfer demand for a layer can be relatively low\nor high compared to the computation requirement of the layer, and hence\ntemporal fluctuations in memory access can be induced eventually causing\nbandwidth problems. In this paper, we first show that there exists a high\ndegree of fluctuation in memory access to computation ratio depending on CNN\nlayers and functions in the layer being processed by the compute units (cores),\nwhere the units are tightly synchronized to maximize data reuse. Then we\npropose a strategy of partitioning the compute units where the cores within\neach partition process a batch of input data synchronously to maximize data\nreuse but different partitions run asynchronously. As the partitions stay\nasynchronous and typically process different CNN layers at any given moment,\nthe memory access traffic sizes of the partitions become statistically\nshuffled. Thus, the partitioning of compute units and asynchronous use of them\nmake the total memory access traffic size be smoothened over time. We call this\nsmoothing statistical memory traffic shaping, and we show that it can lead to\n8.0 percent of performance gain on a commercial 64-core processor when running\nResNet-50.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 08:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

A new analytical model\nthat accounts for the propagation of the local noise sources in the channel to\nthe terminal currents and voltages is proposed in this paper to investigate the\nnoise bias dependence. Carrier number and mobility fluctuations are considered\nas the main causes of low frequency noise and the way these mechanisms\ncontribute to the bias dependence of the noise is analyzed in this work.\nTypically, normalized low frequency noise in graphene devices has been usually\nshown to follow an M-shape dependence versus gate voltage with the minimum near\nthe charge neutrality point (CNP).

The excellent agreement between the experimental data and the predictions\nof the analytical model at all bias conditions confirms that the two\nfundamental 1/f noise mechanisms, carrier number and mobility fluctuations,\nmust be considered simultaneously to properly understand the low frequency\nnoise in graphene FETs.

The planet\nis on a circular orbit in the disk midplane and in the star's equatorial plane.\nWe show that the torques can add up to zero beyond the corotation radius around\nyoung stars and stop inward migration. Monte Carlo simulations predict hot\nJupiter survival rates between ~3% (alpha disk viscosity of 1e-1) and 15%\n(alpha = 1e-3). Once the protoplanetary disk has been fully accreted, the\nsurviving hJs are pushed outward from their tidal migration barrier and pile up\nnear 0.05 AU, as we demonstrate using a numerical implementation of a stellar\ndynamical tide model. Orbital decay is negligible on a one-billion-year\ntimescale due to the contraction of the highly dissipative convective envelopes\nin young Sun-like stars. We find that the higher pile-up efficiency around\nmetal-rich stars can at least partly explain the observed positive correlation\nbetween stellar metallicity and hJ occurrence. Combined with the observed hJ\noccurrence rate, our results for the survival rate imply that <8 % (alpha =\n1e-3) to <43 % (alpha = 1e-1) of sun-like stars initially encounter an inward\nmigrating hJ. This reconciles models and observations of young spinning stars\nwith the observed hJ pile up and hJ occurrence rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 11:27:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 09:24:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 08:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

Within this limit,\nhe showed the existence of a necessary condition, now well known as Taylor's\nconstraint, which requires that the cylindrically-averaged Lorentz torque must\neverywhere vanish; magnetic fields that satisfy this condition are termed\nTaylor states. Taylor further showed that the requirement of this constraint\nbeing continuously satisfied through time prescribes the evolution of the\ngeostrophic flow, the cylindrically-averaged azimuthal flow.

Low cost energy storage can provide this\ndispatchability, but there is no clear technology that can meet the need.\nPumped hydroelectric and compressed air storage have low costs, but they are\ngeographically constrained. Similarly, lithium-ion batteries are becoming\nubiquitous, but even their lower bounding asymptote cost is too high to enable\ncost-competitive dispatchable renewables.

The\napproach exploits an important tradeoff between the accession of an extremely\nlow cost per unit energy stored, by storing heat instead of electricity\ndirectly, while paying the penalty of a lower round trip efficiency. To\nunderstand why this tradeoff is advantageous, we first introduce a framework\nfor evaluating storage technologies that treats round trip efficiency (RTE) as\na variable, in addition to cost per unit energy stored (CPE) and cost per unit\npower (CPP).

In this way,\ndissipationless chiral magnetic (CM) and anomalous Hall (AH) currents appear in\nthe MCS equation of motion, that, together with equations of relativistic\nhydrodynamics, builds the set of constitutive equations of the nonideal\ntransverse Chern-Simons magnetohydrodynamics (CSMHD).

The rotation occurs with increasing\nrapidity and a constant angular velocity $\\omega_{0}$.

In particular, we detect four clouds with masses of\n$0.28\\text{-}1.5\\times 10^4M_\\odot$ with VLBI that do not follow the regular\nrotation of most of the HI. Three of these clouds are located, in projection,\nagainst the nuclear region on scales of $\\lesssim 40\\mathrm{\\,pc}$, while the\nfourth is co-spatial to the south-east lobe at a projected distance of\n$\\sim270\\mathrm{\\,pc}$. Their velocities are between $150$ and\n$640\\mathrm{\\,km\\,s^{-1}}$ blue-shifted with respect to the velocity of the\ndisk-related HI. These findings suggest that the outflow is at least partly\nformed by clouds, as predicted by some numerical simulations and originates\nalready in the inner (few tens of pc) region of the radio galaxy. Our results\nindicate that all of the outflow could consist of many clouds with perhaps\ncomparable properties as the ones detected, distributed also at larger radii\nfrom the nucleus where the lower brightness of the lobe does not allow us to\ndetect them. However, we cannot rule out the presence of a diffuse component of\nthe outflow. The fact that 3C 236 is a low excitation radio galaxy, makes it\nless likely that the optical AGN is able to produce strong radiative winds\nleaving the radio jet as the main driver for the HI outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 13:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

It\ndemonstrates that in the case of a time-invariant objective, most elementary\nresults on gradient descent based on convexity can be replaced by much more\ngeneral results based on contraction. In particular, gradient descent converges\nto a unique equilibrium if its dynamics are contracting in any metric, with\nconvexity of the cost corresponding to the special case of contraction in the\nidentity metric. More broadly, contraction analysis provides new insights for\nthe case of geodesically-convex optimization, wherein non-convex problems in\nEuclidean space can be transformed to convex ones posed over a Riemannian\nmanifold. In this case, natural gradient descent converges to a unique\nequilibrium if it is contracting in any metric, with geodesic convexity of the\ncost corresponding to contraction in the natural metric. New results using\nsemi-contraction provide additional insights into the topology of the set of\noptimizers in the case when multiple optima exist. Furthermore, they show how\nsemi-contraction may be combined with specific additional information to reach\nbroad conclusions about a dynamical system. The contraction perspective also\neasily extends to time-varying optimization settings and allows one to\nrecursively build large optimization structures out of simpler elements.\nExtensions to natural primal-dual optimization and game-theoretic contexts\nfurther illustrate the potential reach of these new perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 13:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 01:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 18:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 22:04:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:54:56 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 02:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

There are typically two\napproaches to modelling cell migration: either micro-scale, discrete or\nmacro-scale, continuum. The discrete approach, using agent-based models (ABMs),\nis typically stochastic and accounts for properties at the cell-scale.\nConversely, the continuum approach, in which cell density is often modelled as\na system of deterministic partial differential equations (PDEs), provides a\nglobal description of the migration at the population level. Deterministic\nmodels have the advantage that they are generally more amenable to mathematical\nanalysis. They can lead to significant insights for situations in which the\nsystem comprises a large number of cells, at which point simulating a\nstochastic ABM becomes computationally expensive. However, finding an\nappropriate continuum model to describe the collective behaviour of a system of\nindividual cells can be a difficult task. Deterministic models are often\nspecified on a phenomenological basis, which reduces their predictive power.\nStochastic ABMs have advantages over their deterministic continuum\ncounterparts. In particular, ABMs can represent individual-level behaviours\n(such as cell proliferation and cell-cell interaction) appropriately and are\namenable to direct parameterisation using experimental data. It is essential,\ntherefore, to establish direct connections between stochastic micro-scale\nbehaviours and deterministic macro-scale dynamics. In this Chapter we describe\nhow, in some situations, these two distinct modelling approaches can be unified\ninto a discrete-continuum equivalence framework.

We illustrate how a cluster-specific\nanalysis of NGC 188 using its own photometric data can produce an unreasonable\nIFMR since its WDs have a narrow range of zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses.\nHowever, the Bayesian hierarchical model corrects the cluster-specific analysis\nby bor- rowing strength from other clusters, thus generating more reliable\nestimates of IFMR parameters.

This is the\nanomalous Nernst effect (ANE) which was thought to be proportional to the value\nof the magnetization for a long time. However, more generally, the ANE has been\npredicted to originate from a net Berry curvature of all bands near the Fermi\nlevel. Subsequently, a large anomalous Nernst thermopower has recently been\nobserved in topological materials with no net magnetization but large net Berry\ncurvature around E$_F$. These experiments clearly fall outside the scope of the\nconventional magnetization-model of the ANE, but a significant question\nremains: Can the value of the ANE in topological ferromagnets exceed the\nhighest values observed in conventional ferromagnets? Here, we report a\nremarkably high anomalous Nernst thermopower value of ~6.0 \\mu V/K at 1 T in\nthe ferromagnetic topological Heusler compound Co$_2$MnGa at room temperature,\nwhich is around 7-times larger than any anomalous Nernst thermopower value ever\nreported for a conventional ferromagnet. Combined electrical, thermoelectric\nand first-principles calculations reveal that this high value of the ANE arises\nfrom a large net Berry curvature near the Fermi level associated with nodal\nlines and Weyl points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

These algebras arise as instances of\nthe general paradigm explored by Haghverdi (Abramsky's Programme), which\namounts to defining a lambda-algebra starting from a GoI Situation in a traced\nsymmetric monoidal category. We investigate this construction from the point of\nview of the model theory of lambda-calculus. We focus on the strictly linear\nand affine parts of Abramsky's Affine Combinatory Algebras, sketching how to\nencompass the full algebra. The gist of our approach is that the GoI\ninterpretation of a term based on involutions is dual to the principal type of\nthe term, w.r.t. the type discipline for a linear/affine lambda-calculus. In\nthe general case the type discipline and the calculus need to be extended,\nresp., with intersection, !-types, and !-abstractions. Our analysis unveils\nthree conceptually independent, but ultimately equivalent, accounts of\napplication in the lambda-calculus: beta-reduction, the GoI application of\ninvolutions based on symmetric feedback (Girard's Execution Formula), and\nunification of principal types. Thus we provide an answer, in the strictly\naffine case, to the question raised in [1] of characterising the partial\ninvolutions arising from bi-orthogonal pattern matching automata, which are\ndenotations of affine combinators, and we point to the answer to the full\nquestion. Furthermore, we prove that the strictly linear combinatory algebra of\npartial involutions is a strictly linear lambda-algebra, albeit not a\ncombinatory model, while both the strictly affine combinatory algebra and the\nfull affine combinatory algebra are not.

Kid-Net reduces kidney vessels segmentation time\nfrom matter of hours to minutes. It is trained end-to-end using 3D patches from\nvolumetric CT-images. A complete segmentation for a 512x512x512 CT-volume is\nobtained within a few minutes (1-2 mins) by stitching the output 3D patches\ntogether. Feature down-sampling and up-sampling are utilized to achieve higher\nclassification and localization accuracies. Quantitative and qualitative\nevaluation results on a challenging testing dataset show Kid-Net competence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

However, existing nonparametric independence\ntests typically require computation that scales at least quadratically with the\nsample size, making it difficult to apply them to massive data. Moreover,\nresampling is usually necessary to evaluate the statistical significance of the\nresulting test statistics at finite sample sizes, further worsening the\ncomputational burden. We introduce a scalable, resampling-free approach to\ntesting the independence between two random vectors by breaking down the task\ninto simple univariate tests of independence on a collection of 2x2 contingency\ntables constructed through sequential coarse-to-fine discretization of the\nsample space, transforming the inference task into a multiple testing problem\nthat can be completed with almost linear complexity with respect to the sample\nsize. To address increasing dimensionality, we introduce a coarse-to-fine\nsequential adaptive procedure that exploits the spatial features of dependency\nstructures to more effectively examine the sample space. We derive a\nfinite-sample theory that guarantees the inferential validity of our adaptive\nprocedure at any given sample size. In particular, we show that our approach\ncan achieve strong control of the family-wise error rate without resampling or\nlarge-sample approximation. We demonstrate the substantial computational\nadvantage of the procedure in comparison to existing approaches as well as its\ndecent statistical power under various dependency scenarios through an\nextensive simulation study, and illustrate how the divide-and-conquer nature of\nthe procedure can be exploited to not just test independence but to learn the\nnature of the underlying dependency.

In applying the new method to\nconvection-dominated problems, the method provides optimal convergence in\npotential and suboptimal convergence in flux, which is comparable to other\nexisting DG methods, and achieves $L^2$ stability by making use of a\nskew-symmetric discretization of the convection term, irrespective of\ndiffusivity.

The impact of the accretion material on the\nstellar atmosphere results in a strong shock, which causes emission from the\nX-ray to the near-infrared (NIR) domain. Shock velocities of several 100 km\ns$^{-1}$ imply that the immediate post shock plasma emits mainly in X-rays.\nIndeed, two X-ray diagnostics, the so-called soft excess and the high densities\nobserved in He-like triplets, differentiate CTTSs from their non-accreting\nsiblings. However, accretion shock properties derived from X-ray diagnostics\noften contradict established ultraviolet (UV)-NIR accretion tracers and a\nphysical model simultaneously explaining both, X-ray and UV-NIR accretion\ntracers, is not yet available.\n  We present new XMM-Newton and Chandra grating observations of the CTTS T\nTauri combined with UV and optical data. During all epochs, the soft excess is\nlarge and the densities derived from the O VII and Ne IX He-like triplets are\ncompatible with coronal densities. This confirms that the soft X-ray emission\ncannot originate in accretion funnels that carry the bulk of the accretion rate\ndespite T Tauri's large soft excess. Instead, we propose a model of radially\ndensity stratified accretion columns to explain the density diagnostics and the\nsoft excess. In addition, accretion rate and X-ray luminosity are inversely\ncorrelated in T Tauri over several epochs. Such an anti-correlation has been\nobserved in samples of stars. Hence the process causing it must be intrinsic to\nthe accretion process, and we speculate that the stellar magnetic field\nconfiguration on the visibile hemisphere affects both the accretion rate and\nthe coronal emission, eventually causing the observed anti-correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The beam lies on the Winkler foundation with a point\ninhomogeneity (a concentrated spring with negative time-varying stiffness). In\nsuch a system with constant parameters (the spring stiffness), under certain\nconditions a trapped mode of oscillation exists and is unique. Therefore,\napplying a non-stationary external excitation to this system can lead to the\nemergence of the beam oscillations localized near the inhomogeneity. We provide\nan analytical description of non-stationary localized oscillations in the\nsystem with time-varying properties using the asymptotic procedure based on\nsuccessive application of two asymptotic methods, namely the method of\nstationary phase and the method of multiple scales. The obtained analytical\nresults were verified by independent numerical calculations. The applicability\nof the analytical formulas was demonstrated for various types of external\nexcitation and laws governing the varying stiffness. In particular, we have\nshown that in the case when the trapped mode frequency approaches zero,\nlocalized low-frequency oscillations with increasing amplitude precede the\nlocalized beam buckling. The dependence of the amplitude of such oscillations\non its frequency is more complicated in comparison with the case of a one\ndegree of freedom system with time-varying stiffness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 18:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 15:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}
