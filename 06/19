As the IR\ndielectric function is governed by the optic phonon behavior, such control\nprovides a means to create a new dielectric function distinct from either\nconstituent material and to tune the range over which SPhPs can be supported.\nThis work offers the first glimpse of the guiding principles governing the\ndegree to which the dielectric function can be designed using this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 16:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

In general, the coarse-grained sites, i.e.\nthose effective force centres onto which the all-atom structure is mapped, are\nconstructed based on intuitive rules: a typical choice for proteins is to\nretain only the C$_\\alpha$ atoms of each amino acid. However, a mapping\nstrategy relying only on the atom type and not the local properties of its\nembedding can be suboptimal compared to a more careful selection.

One of the\nproposed variants, FVN (Frequency domain Velvet Noise) applies the procedure to\ngenerate a velvet noise on the cyclic frequency domain of DFT (Discrete Fourier\nTransform). Then, by smoothing the generated signal to design the phase of an\nall-pass filter followed by inverse Fourier transform yields the proposed FVN.\nTemporally variable frequency weighted mixing of FVN generated by frozen and\nshuffled random number provides a unified excitation signal which can span from\nrandom noise to a repetitive pulse train.

Technological advances could soon make an exomoon\ndiscovery with Kepler or the upcoming CHEOPS and PLATO space missions possible.\nExomoon climates might be substantially different from exoplanet climates\nbecause the day-night cycles on moons are determined by the moon's synchronous\nrotation with its host planet. Moreover, planetary illumination at the top of\nthe moon's atmosphere and tidal heating at the moon's surface can be\nsubstantial, which can affect the redistribution of energy on exomoons.

The strong thermal irradiation\nfrom a young giant planet causes the satellite's polar regions to warm, which\nremains consistent with the dynamically-driven polar amplification seen in\nEarth models that lack ice-albedo feedback. Thermal irradiation from young,\nluminous giant planets onto water-rich exomoons can be strong enough to induce\nwater loss on a planet, which could lead to a runaway greenhouse.

These results confirm and extend the results from our\nprevious deep surface photometry of M101's outer disk, providing an important\ncross-check on stellar population studies using resolved stellar populations\nversus integrated light photometry.

As they arise from the highest peaks\nin the matter density field, the spatial distribution of luminous objects is\nbiased towards those peaks. On large scales, where density fluctuations are\nmild, this bias simply amounts to a constant offset in the clustering amplitude\nof the tracer, known as linear bias. In this work we focus on the relative bias\nbetween galaxies and galaxy clusters that are located inside and in the\nvicinity of cosmic voids, extended regions of relatively low density in the\nlarge-scale structure of the Universe. With the help of hydro-dynamical\nsimulations we verify that the relation between galaxy and cluster overdensity\naround voids remains linear. Hence, the void-centric density profiles of\ndifferent tracers can be linked by a single multiplicative constant. This\namounts to the same value as the relative linear bias between tracers for the\nlargest voids in the sample. For voids of small sizes, which typically arise in\nhigher density regions, this constant has a higher value, possibly showing an\nenvironmental dependence similar to that observed for the linear bias itself.\nWe confirm our findings by analysing mocks and data obtained during the first\nyear of observations by the Dark Energy Survey.

Interestingly,\ncombining dark matter production and successful leptogenesis gives rise to\nstrict limits from big bang nucleosynthesis which do not allow the mass of dark\nmatter to lie above $\\sim 10$ keV, providing a phenomenological hint for\nconsidered low-scale dark matter. By featuring the keV-scale dark matter free\nfrom stringent X-ray limits, successful baryon asymmetry generation and\nnon-zero active neutrino masses, the model is a direct analogue to the $\\nu$MSM\nmodel proposed by Asaka, Blanchet and Shaposhnikov. Therefore we dub the\npresented framework as \"The new $\\nu$MSM\" abbreviated as $\\nu\\nu$MSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 09:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

A\ngalactic turbulent dynamo is found to be naturally excited in this cosmological\nenvironment, being responsible for most of the amplification of the magnetic\nenergy.

Overall, the amplification process can be\ndivided in three main phases, which are related to different physical\nmechanisms driving galaxy evolution: an initial collapse phase, an\naccretion-driven phase, and a feedback-driven phase. While different feedback\nmodels affect the magnetic field amplification differently, all tested models\nprove to be subdominant at early epochs, before the feedback-driven phase is\nreached.

The first is a comprehensive list and\ndiscussion of the major uncertainties of theoretically predicted gravity-mode\noscillation frequencies based on linear pulsation theory, caused by fixing\nchoices of the input physics for evolutionary models. Guided by a hierarchy\namong these uncertainties of theoretical frequencies, we subsequently provide a\nglobal methodological scheme to achieve forward asteroseismic modeling.

We go beyond local kinematic tracers and use\nrotation curve data up to 200 kpc to construct a MW mass model and\nself-consistently determine the local phase-space distribution of DM. This\napproach mitigates any incomplete understanding of local dark matter-visible\nmatter degeneracies that can affect the determination of the VDF. Comparing\nwith the oft used Standard Halo Model (SHM), which assumes an isothermal VDF,\nwe look at how the tail of the empirically determined VDF alters our\ninterpretation of the present direct detection WIMP DM cross section exclusion\nlimits. While previous studies have suggested a very large difference (of more\nthan an order of magnitude) in the bounds at low DM masses, we show that\naccounting for the detector response at low threshold energies, the difference\nis still significant although less extreme. The change in the number of signal\nevents, when using the empirically determined DM VDF in contrast to the SHM\nVDF, is most prominent for low DM masses for which the shape of the recoil\nenergy spectrum depends sensitively on the detector threshold energy as well as\ndetector response near the threshold. We demonstrate that these trends carry\nover to the respective DM exclusion limits, modulo detailed understanding of\nthe experimental backgrounds. With the unprecedented precision of astrometric\ndata in the GAIA era, use of observationally determined DM phase-space will\nbecome a critical and necessary ingredient for DM searches.

Because of the near-criticality, the preferential attraction between\nthe domain component and one of the mixture components generates the\ncomposition gradient outside the domain significantly and can affect the drag\ncoefficient. We first consider a domain having the same membrane viscosity as\nthe domain exterior. The drag coefficient is expanded with respect to a\ndimensionless strength of the preferential attraction. It is numerically shown\nthat the magnitude of the expansion coefficient decreases much as the order of\nthe strength increases and that the first-order term of the series usually\ngives a good approximation for practical material constants. The effect of the\npreferential attraction is shown to be able to become significantly large in\npractice. We second consider cases where the membrane viscosities of the domain\ninterior and exterior are different. The first-order term of the expansion\nseries decreases to approach zero as the domain viscosity increases to\ninfinity. This agrees with previous numerical results showing that the\nhydrodynamics makes the effect of the preferential attraction negligibly small\nfor a rigid disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 18:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Magnetic reconnection during flares takes place in the corona but a\nsubstantial part of flare energy is deposited in the chromosphere. However,\nhigh-resolution spectro-polarimetric chromospheric observations of flares are\nvery rare. The most used observables are Ca II 8542 {\\AA} and He I 10830 {\\AA}.\nAims. We aim to study the chromosphere during a C3.6 class flare via\nspectro-polarimetric observations of the He I D3 line. Methods. We present the\nfirst SST/CRISP spectro-polarimetric observations of He I D3. We analyze the\ndata using the inversion code HAZEL, and estimate the LOS velocity and the\nmagnetic field vector. Results. Strong He I D3 emission at the flare\nfootpoints, as well as strong He I D3 absorption profiles tracing the flaring\nloops are observed during the flare. The He I D3 traveling emission kernels at\nthe flare footpoints exhibit strong chromospheric condensations of up to $\\sim$\n60 km/s at their leading edge. Our observations suggest that such condensations\nresult in shocking the deep chromosphere, causing broad and modestly\nblueshifted He I D3 profiles indicating subsequent upflows. A strong and rather\nvertical magnetic field of up to $\\sim$ 2500 G is measured in the flare\nfootpoints, confirming that the He I D3 line is likely formed in the deep\nchromosphere at those locations. We provide chromospheric line-of-sight\nvelocity and magnetic field maps obtained via He I D3 inversions. We propose a\nfan-spine configuration as the flare magnetic field topology. Conclusions. The\nHe I D3 line is an excellent diagnostic to study the chromosphere during\nflares. The impact of strong condensations on the deep chromosphere has been\nobserved.

We apply the model to\nstudy the reaction of the Earth's upper atmosphere to large changes in the\nCO$_2$ abundance and to changes in the input solar XUV field due to the Sun's\nactivity evolution from 3~Gyr in the past to 2.5~Gyr in the future.\n  Methods: For the thermal atmosphere structure, we consider heating from the\nabsorption of stellar X-ray, UV, and IR radiation, heating from exothermic\nchemical reactions, electron heating from collisions with non-thermal\nphotoelectrons, Joule heating, cooling from IR emission by several species,\nthermal conduction, and energy exchanges between the neutral, ion, and electron\ngases.

This describes many aspects of the workflow within organizations, as\nwell as many of the activities undertaken by regulatory bodies, who often\nobtain relevant information from the parties being regulated through a process\nof delegation. A fundamental tension underlying delegation is the fact that the\nagent's interests will typically differ -- potentially significantly -- from\nthe interests of the principal, and as a result the agent may propose solutions\nbased on their own incentives that are inefficient for the principal. A basic\nproblem, therefore, is to design mechanisms by which the principal can\nconstrain the set of proposals they are willing to accept from the agent, to\nensure a certain level of quality for the principal from the proposed solution.\n  In this work, we investigate how much the principal loses -- quantitatively,\nin terms of the objective they are trying to optimize -- when they delegate to\nan agent. We develop a methodology for bounding this loss of efficiency, and\nshow that in a very general model of delegation, there is a family of\nmechanisms achieving a universal bound on the ratio between the quality of the\nsolution obtained through delegation and the quality the principal could obtain\nin an idealized benchmark where they searched for a solution themself.\nMoreover, it is possible to achieve such bounds through mechanisms with a\nnatural threshold structure, which are thus structurally simpler than the\noptimal mechanisms typically considered in the literature on delegation. At the\nheart of our framework is an unexpected connection between delegation and the\nanalysis of prophet inequalities, which we leverage to provide bounds on the\nbehavior of our delegation mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 20:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

Calibration of the DIA assay to the MIC assay is typically done using\nthe error-rate bounded method, which selects DIA breakpoints that minimize the\nobserved discrepancies between the two assays. In 2000, Craig proposed a\nmodel-based approach that specifically models the measurement error and\nrounding processes of each assay, the underlying pathogen distribution, and the\ntrue monotonic relationship between the two assays.

In the current study, an existing gasoline surrogate formulation\nalgorithm is further enhanced by incorporating novel chemometric models.

It appears in human activity\n(sports, cooking), animal behavior (a bee's waggle dance), natural phenomena\n(leaves in the wind) and in urban environments (flashing lights). Estimating\nvisual repetition from realistic video is challenging as periodic motion is\nrarely perfectly static and stationary. To better deal with realistic video, we\nelevate the static and stationary assumptions often made by existing work. Our\nspatiotemporal filtering approach, established on the theory of periodic\nmotion, effectively handles a wide variety of appearances and requires no\nlearning. Starting from motion in 3D we derive three periodic motion types by\ndecomposition of the motion field into its fundamental components. In addition,\nthree temporal motion continuities emerge from the field's temporal dynamics.\nFor the 2D perception of 3D motion we consider the viewpoint relative to the\nmotion; what follows are 18 cases of recurrent motion perception. To estimate\nrepetition under all circumstances, our theory implies constructing a mixture\nof differential motion maps: gradient, divergence and curl. We temporally\nconvolve the motion maps with wavelet filters to estimate repetitive dynamics.\nOur method is able to spatially segment repetitive motion directly from the\ntemporal filter responses densely computed over the motion maps. For\nexperimental verification of our claims, we use our novel dataset for\nrepetition estimation, better-reflecting reality with non-static and\nnon-stationary repetitive motion.

Thus, the changes\nobserved on the particle sizes as reaction conditions, such as concentrations,\ntemperature, type of surfactant used, etc., are varied should not be correlated\ndirectly to the modification of those conditions but indirectly to the changes\nthey produce on the reaction rates. By means of time resolved UV-vis\nspectroscopy, we measured the reaction rates in the production of Pd\nnanoparticles inside microemulsions at different reactant concentrations,\nkeeping all the other parameters constant. The measured reaction rates were\nthen correlated with the particle sizes measured by transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM). We found that nanoparticle size increases linearly as the\nreaction rates increases, independently of the actual reactant concentrations.\nWe proposed that the kinetics is controlled mainly by the diffusion of the\nreducing agent through the surfactant monolayer covering the microemulsion\nmembrane. With this model, we predicted that particle size should depend\nindirectly, via the reaction kinetics, on the micelle radius (v0 ~ r^-3), the\nwater volume (v0~vw^3) and the total microemulsion volume (v0~vT^-3), and\ntemperature (Arrhenius).

In this work, we introduce the Boltzmannian MDL (BMDL), a\nformalization of the principle of MDL with a parametric complexity conveniently\nformulated as the free-energy of an artificial thermodynamic system. In this\nway, we leverage on the rich theoretical and technical background of\nstatistical mechanics, to show the crucial importance that phase transitions\nand other thermodynamic concepts have on the problem of statistical modeling\nfrom an information theoretic point of view.

We identify that\nmulti-phonon processes emerge in the optomechanical system and show that a\nmechanical oscillator prepared in the ground state will evolve into an\namplitude-squared squeezed vacuum state. The Wigner distribution of the steady\nstate of the mechanical oscillator is non-Gaussian exhibiting quantum\ninterference and four-fold symmetry. This nonclassical mechanical state,\ngenerated via reservoir engineering, can be used for quantum correlation\nmeasurements of the position and momentum of the mechanics below the standard\nquantum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 01:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

In motion compensation,\nfractional interpolation is used to obtain more reference blocks at sub-pixel\nlevel. Existing video coding standards commonly use fixed interpolation filters\nfor fractional interpolation, which are not efficient enough to handle diverse\nvideo signals well. In this paper, we design a group variational transformation\nconvolutional neural network (GVTCNN) to improve the fractional interpolation\nperformance of the luma component in motion compensation. GVTCNN infers samples\nat different sub-pixel positions from the input integer-position sample. It\nfirst extracts a shared feature map from the integer-position sample to infer\nvarious sub-pixel position samples. Then a group variational transformation\ntechnique is used to transform a group of copied shared feature maps to samples\nat different sub-pixel positions.

The\nPC-$\\alpha$AMG is based on unsmoothed aggregation AMG (UA-AMG). To preserve the\nstructure of smooth error down to the coarse levels, we approximate the level\nsets of the smooth error by first forming vertex-disjoint path cover with paths\nfollowing the level sets. The aggregations are then formed by matching along\nthe paths in the path cover. In such manner, we are able to build a multilevel\nstructure at a low computational cost. The proposed PC-$\\alpha$AMG provides a\nmechanism to efficiently re-build the multilevel hierarchy during the\niterations and leads to a fast nonlinear multilevel algorithm. Traditionally,\nUA-AMG requires more sophisticated cycling techniques, such as AMLI-cycle or\nK-cycle, but as our numerical results show, the PC-$\\alpha$AMG proposed here\nleads to nearly optimal standard V-cycle algorithm for solving linear systems\nwith weighted graph Laplacians.

When the radiative temperature\ngradient $\\nabla_{\\rm rad}$ shows a minimum value in the convective core, the\nconvective core may be divided into two convection zones if the minimum value\nof $\\nabla_{\\rm rad}$ is smaller than the adiabatic temperature gradient\n$\\nabla_{\\rm ad}$. For the single-zone case, the overshooting mixing still\nshows an exponential decay behaviour, but the overshooting distance is much\nsmaller than in the initial stage. For the double-zone case, the overshooting\nmixing is similar to that of the single-case beyond the convective core, while\nit almost stops on both sides of the above convective shell. Our overshooting\nmixing scheme is similar to the maximal overshoot scheme of Constantino et al.\n(2015). In the final stage, continuous injection of fresh helium into the\nconvective core by the overshooting mixing happens, which is similar to the\n\"core breathing pulses\" (Sweigart \\& Demarque 1973; Castellani et al. 1985).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 05:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Traditional methods rely on handcrafted local features and\nprobabilistic graphical models to incorporate local and global cues. Recently,\nmethods based on fully convolutional neural networks have achieved new records\non scene parsing. An important strategy common to these methods is the\naggregation of hierarchical features yielded by a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork. However, typical algorithms usually aggregate hierarchical\nconvolutional features via concatenation or linear combination, which cannot\nsufficiently exploit the diversities of contextual information in multi-scale\nfeatures and the spatial inhomogeneity of a scene.

In addition, we\npropose a variant of mixture-of-experts called the adaptive hierarchical\nfeature aggregation (AHFA) mechanism which can be incorporated into existing\nscene parsing networks that use skip-connections to fuse features layer-wisely.\nIn the proposed networks, different levels of features at each spatial location\nare adaptively re-weighted according to the local structure and surrounding\ncontextual information before aggregation.

Recent advances in deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant successes in\nmedical image analysis and particularly in computational histopathology.\nBecause of the outrageous large size of WSIs, most of the methods divide one\nslide into lots of small image patches and perform classification on each patch\nindependently. However, neighboring patches often share spatial correlations,\nand ignoring these spatial correlations may result in inconsistent predictions.\nIn this paper, we propose a neural conditional random field (NCRF) deep\nlearning framework to detect cancer metastasis in WSIs. NCRF considers the\nspatial correlations between neighboring patches through a fully connected CRF\nwhich is directly incorporated on top of a CNN feature extractor. The whole\ndeep network can be trained end-to-end with standard back-propagation algorithm\nwith minor computational overhead from the CRF component. The CNN feature\nextractor can also benefit from considering spatial correlations via the CRF\ncomponent. Compared to the baseline method without considering spatial\ncorrelations, we show that the proposed NCRF framework obtains probability maps\nof patch predictions with better visual quality. We also demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms the baseline in cancer metastasis detection on the\nCamelyon16 dataset and achieves an average FROC score of 0.8096 on the test\nset.

Although these solutions are repeatedly\nconsidered as solitary waves (and even solitons), their temporal stability has\nnever been proven. In this paper, a numerical study of the Vlasov-Poisson\nsystem is made to follow their temporal evolution in the presence of numerical\nnoise and thereby test their long-time propagation stability. Considering the\nion-acoustic regime, both constituents of the plasma, i.e. electrons and ions\nare treated following their distribution functions in these set of fully\nkinetic simulations. The findings reveal that the stability of Sagdeev solution\ndepends on a combination of two parameters, i.e. velocity and trapping\nparameter. It is shown that there exists a critical value of trapping parameter\nfor both fast and slow solutions which separates the stable from unstable\nsolutions. In case of stable solutions, it is shown that these nonlinear\nstructures can propagate for long periods, which confirms their status as\nsolitary waves. Stable solutions are reported for both Maxwellian and Kappa\ndistribution functions. For unstable solutions, it is demonstrated that the\ninstability causes the Sagdeev solution to decay by emitting ion-acoustic\nwave-packets on its propagation trail. The instability is shown to take place\nin a large range of velocity and even for Sagdeev solutions with velocity much\nhigher than ion sound speed.

This\nscenario can be modeled as a zero-sum extensive-form game in which each player\ncan play multiple times. The game tree is exponentially large both in the size\nof the graph and in the number of attacking resources. We show that when the\nnumber of the Attacker's resources is free, the problem of computing the\nequilibrium path is NP-hard, while when the number of resources is fixed, the\nequilibrium path can be computed in poly-time. We provide a dynamic-programming\nalgorithm that, given the number of the Attacker's resources, computes the\nequilibrium path requiring poly-time in the size of the graph and exponential\ntime in the number of the resources. Furthermore, since in real-world scenarios\nit is implausible that the Defender knows the number of attacking resources, we\nstudy the robustness of the Defender's strategy when she makes a wrong guess\nabout that number. We show that even the error of just a single resource can\nlead to an arbitrary inefficiency, when the inefficiency is defined as the\nratio of the Defender's utilities obtained with a wrong guess and a correct\nguess. However, a more suitable definition of inefficiency is given by the\ndifference of the Defender's utilities: this way, we observe that the higher\nthe error in the estimation, the higher the loss for the Defender. Then, we\ninvestigate the performance of online algorithms when no information about the\nAttacker's resources is available.

While dynamo action in a\nturbulent plasma is often invoked, in the last years a novel mechanism of\nquantum origin has gained increasingly more attention, namely the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME). This has been recognized in semi-metals and it is most\nlikely at work in the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collision\nexperiments, where the highest magnetic fields in nature, up to B~10^18 G, are\nproduced. This effect is expected to survive even at large hydrodynamical/MHD\nscales and it is based on the chiral anomaly due to an imbalance between left-\nand right-handed relativistic fermions in the constituent plasma. Such\nimbalance leads to an electric current parallel to an external magnetic field,\nwhich is precisely the same mechanism of an alpha-dynamo action in classical\nMHD.

The target infrared point source\nis spatially resolved into two dense molecular cloud cores; one is associated\nwith a high-mass young stellar object (YSO core), while another is not\nassociated with an infrared source (East core). The two cores are dynamically\nassociated but show different chemical characteristics. Emission lines of CS,\nC33S, H2CS, SO, SO2, CH3OH, H13CO+, H13CN, SiO, and dust continuum are detected\nfrom the observed region. Tentative detection of HDS is also reported. The\nfirst detection of CH3OH in the SMC has a strong impact on our understanding of\nthe formation of complex organic molecules in metal-poor environments. The gas\ntemperature is estimated to be ~10 K based on the rotation analysis of CH3OH\nlines. The fractional abundance of CH3OH gas in the East core is estimated to\nbe (0.5-1.5) x 10^(-8), which is comparable with or marginally higher than\nthose of similar cold sources in our Galaxy despite a factor of five lower\nmetallicity in the SMC. This work provides observational evidence that an\norganic molecule like CH3OH, which is largely formed on grain surfaces, can be\nproduced even in a significantly lower metallicity environment compared to the\nsolar neighborhood. A possible origin of cold CH3OH gas in the observed dense\ncore is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 09:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 03:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Water and dust may be trapped during the\ncondensation and freed during the sublimation. In addition, ice may be\ntranslucent or granular depending on the deposition process (snow vs direct\ncondensation), annealing efficiency, and dust sinking process. The\ndetermination of ice translucency is of particular interest to confirm or\nreject the cold jet model (also known as Kieffer model).\n  This work is focused on the dune field of Richardson Crater in which strong\ninteractions between the water, dust and CO$_{2}$ cycles are observed. We\nanalyzed CRISM hyperspectral images in the near IR using radiative transfer\nmodel inversion. We demonstrate that among the states of CO$_{2}$ ice, the\ntranslucent state is observed most frequently. The monitoring of surface\ncharacteristics shows a decrease in the thickness of the ice during the spring\nconsistently with climate models simulations. We estimate a very low dust\ncontent of a few ppmv into the CO$_{2}$ ice, consistent with the formation\nscenario of cold jets. The water impurities is around 0.1\\%v, almost stable\nduring the spring, suggesting a water escape from the surface of subliming\nCO$_{2}$ ice layer. The water ice grain size varies in a range 1 to 50 microns.\nFrom these results, we propose the following new mechanism of small water ice\ngrain suspension: as a cold jet occurs, water ice grains of various sizes are\nlifted from the surface. These jets happen during daytime, when the general\nupward gas flux from the subliming CO$_{2}$ ice layer is strong enough to carry\nthe smaller grains, while the bigger fall back on the CO$_{2}$ ice layer. The\nsmaller water grains are carried away and integrated to the general atmospheric\ncirculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 10:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Unfortunately, many popular large-scale Bayesian models, such as\nnetwork or topic models, require inference on sparse simplex spaces. To avoid\nthe biases caused by this discretization error, we propose the stochastic\nCox-Ingersoll-Ross process (SCIR), which removes all discretization error and\nwe prove that samples from the SCIR process are asymptotically unbiased. We\ndiscuss how this idea can be extended to target other constrained spaces. Use\nof the SCIR process within a SGMCMC algorithm is shown to give substantially\nbetter performance for a topic model and a Dirichlet process mixture model than\nexisting SGMCMC approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 10:08:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 16:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

We demonstrate\nthat these unstable estimates cannot be relied upon for effective parameter\ntuning. The resulting tuned parameters are highly sensitive to how our data is\npartitioned, meaning that we often select sub-optimal parameter choices and\nhave serious reproducibility issues.\n  Instead, we propose to use the less variable J-K-fold CV, in which J\nindependent K-fold cross validations are used to assess performance. Our main\ncontributions are extending J-K-fold CV from performance estimation to\nparameter tuning and investigating how to choose J and K. We argue that\nvariability is more important than bias for effective tuning and so advocate\nlower choices of K than are typically seen in the NLP literature, instead use\nthe saved computation to increase J.

An example is\n3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI), which measures the birefringence of\nhistological brain sections to derive the spatial nerve fiber orientations.\nHere, we show how light scattering in transmission microscopy measurements can\nbe leveraged to gain 3D structural information about fibrous tissue samples\nlike brain tissue. For this purpose, we developed a simulation framework using\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and high performance\ncomputing, which can easily be adapted to other microscopy techniques and\ntissue types with comparable fibrous structures (e.g., muscle fibers, collagen,\nor artificial fibers). As conventional bright-field transmission microscopy\nprovides usually only 2D information about tissue structures, a\nthree-dimensional reconstruction of fibers across several sections is\ndifficult. By combining our simulations with experimental studies, we show that\nthe polarization-independent transmitted light intensity (transmittance)\ncontains 3D information: We demonstrate in several experimental studies on\nbrain sections from different species (rodent, monkey, human) that the\ntransmittance decreases significantly (by more than 50%) with the increasing\nout-of-plane angle of the nerve fibers. Our FDTD simulations show that this\ndecrease is mainly caused by polarization-independent light scattering in\ncombination with the finite numerical aperture of the imaging system. This\nallows to use standard transmission microscopy techniques to obtain 3D\ninformation about the fiber inclination and to detect steep fibers, without\nneed for additional measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 12:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 18:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

Hence,\nthose electron levels appear exclusively after the ionization of neutral\nfullerene taking into account the unique geometrical shape of sphere. The\nexistence of those levels is argued, and their basic parameters (the energy\nlevels, the wave eigenfunctions) are approximately calculated. The wave\nfunctions of VLELs are basically localized inside fullerene ion sphere (with a\nmaximum amplitude in the centre) in contrast to ordinary surface-localized\nelectron levels (SLELs) having a wave functions in the vicinity of fullerene\nsphere formed by the cluster composed of carbon ions.

The BZ LMs have solid--liquid interfaces in\ncontrast to the previously reported BZ encapsulation systems used to study\npattern formations and wave transfers, such as BZ emulsions and BZ vesicles.\nAll these systems are important to study as they can be seen as analogues for\ninformation transfer in excitable systems in nature. Due to the powder coating\nof the LMs, LMs do not wet the underlying substrate, making the LMs mobile,\nenabling them to be easily arranged in arrays. The preparation of complex LMs,\ncontaining an acidic oscillating solution, proves the resilience of LMs and\ntheir application in transporting a wide range of chemical cargoes and in\nplaying a mediating role in chemical reactions. PTFE-coated LMs were harder to\nprepare and not as robust as PE-coated LMs, therefore oscillation studies of BZ\nLMs positioned in arrays only focused on PE-coated LMs. Sporadic transfer of\nexcitation waves was observed between LMs placed in close proximity to each\nother in ordered and disordered arrays, suggesting the transfer of liquid\nspecies possibly arises from contact between imperfectly coated areas at the\nLM--LM interface or capillary action, where solution is actively transported to\nthe marble surface through the coating. Propagation pathways of the excitation\nwaves in both the disordered and ordered arrays of BZ LMs are reported. These\nresults lay the foundations for future studies on information transmission and\nprocessing arrays of BZ LMs, in addition to observing BZ wave propagation in a\nLM and the effect of other physical stimuli such as heat, light and chemical\nenvironments on the dynamics of excitation in arrays of BZ Lms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 12:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

One possibility for modeling SNe\nlight curves is the construction of a simplified semi-analytic model, which can\nbe used for getting order-of magnitude estimates of the SN properties. One of\nthe strongest simplification in most of these light curve models is the\nassumption of the constant Thomson-scattering opacity that can be determined as\nthe average opacity of the ejecta. Here we present a systematic analysis for\nestimating the average opacity in different types of core-collapse supernovae\n(CCSNe) that can be used as the constant opacity of the ejecta in simplified\nsemi-analytic models.

In\nthis analysis we first generate MESA (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018)\nstellar models with different physical parameters (initial mass, metallicity,\nrotation), which determine the mass-loss history of the model star. Then we\nsynthesize SN LCs from these models with the SNEC hydrodynamic code (Morozova\net al. 2015) and calculate the Rosseland mean opacity in every mass element.\nFinally, we compute the average opacities by integrating these Rosseland mean\nopacities. As a result we find that the average opacities from our calculations\nshow adequate agreement with the opacities generally used in previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 12:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

We present an economic\nmodel that leverages Modern Portfolio Theory to predict a miner's allocation\nover time using price data and inferred risk tolerance.

Moreover, theoretical\nmodelling in recent literature as well as presented in this paper suggests that\nthe dissipation of the dynamical tide, constituted of tidal inertial waves\npropagating in the convective envelope, is weak compared to the dissipation of\nthe equilibrium tide during the red-giant phase.

Ablation\ntargeting rotor sites has resulted in arrhythmia termination. Recent clinical,\nexperimental and modelling studies demonstrate that rotors are often anchored\naround fibrotic scars or regions with increased fibrosis. However the\nmechanisms leading to abundance of rotors at these locations are not clear. The\ncurrent study explores the hypothesis whether fibrotic scars just serve as\nanchoring sites for the rotors or whether there are other active processes\nwhich drive the rotors to these fibrotic regions. Rotors were induced at\ndifferent distances from fibrotic scars of various sizes and degree of\nfibrosis. Simulations were performed in a 2D model of human ventricular tissue\nand in a patient-specific model of the left ventricle of a patient with remote\nmyocardial infarction. In both the 2D and the patient-specific model we found\nthat without fibrotic scars, the rotors were stable at the site of their\ninitiation. However, in the presence of a scar, rotors were eventually\ndynamically anchored from large distances by the fibrotic scar via a process of\ndynamical reorganization of the excitation pattern. This process coalesces with\na change from polymorphic to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 13:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

The sensor is equipped with a battery of finite size\nto save its incoming energy, and consumes one unit of energy per status update\ntransmission, which is delivered to the destination instantly over an\nerror-free channel. The setting is online in which the harvested energy is\nrevealed to the sensor causally over time, and the goal is to design status\nupdate transmission policy such that the long term average age of information\n(AoI) is minimized. AoI is defined as the time elapsed since the latest update\nhas reached at the destination. Two energy arrival models are considered: a\nrandom battery recharge (RBR) model, and an incremental battery recharge (IBR)\nmodel. In both models, energy arrives according to a Poisson process with unit\nrate, with values that completely fill up the battery in the RBR model, and\nwith values that fill up the battery incrementally, unit-by-unit, in the IBR\nmodel. The key approach to characterizing the optimal status update policy for\nboth models is showing the optimality of renewal policies, in which the\ninter-update times follow a specific renewal process that depends on the energy\narrival model and the battery size. It is then shown that the optimal renewal\npolicy has an energy-dependent threshold structure, in which the sensor sends a\nstatus update only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that depends on\nthe energy available. For both the RBR and the IBR models, the optimal\nenergy-dependent thresholds are characterized explicitly, i.e., in closed-form,\nin terms of the optimal long term average AoI. It is also shown that the\noptimal thresholds are monotonically decreasing in the energy available in the\nbattery, and that the smallest threshold, which comes in effect when the\nbattery is full, is equal to the optimal long term average AoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 17:50:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 15:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

In addition to the\nlemma, one often uses unions and intersections of typical sets in the inner\nbound arguments without so much as giving them a second thought. These\narguments do not work in the quantum setting. This bottleneck shows up in the\nfact that so-called simultaneous decoders, as opposed to successive\ncancellation decoders, are known for very few channels in quantum network\ninformation theory. Another manifestation of this bottleneck is the lack of\nso-called simultaneous smoothing theorems for quantum states.\n  In this paper, we overcome the bottleneck by proving for the first time a\none-shot quantum joint typicality lemma with robust union and intersection\nproperties. To do so, we develop two novel tools in quantum information theory\nwhich may be of independent interest.

The\nscheme is information-theoretic secure. Since each of the n shares is stored on\na different host (shareholder), an attacker will need to compromise k different\nshareholders for obtaining an amount of data sufficient for reconstructing the\nsecret. Furthermore, in order to be resistant to the compromising of the server\n(dealer) coordinating the shareholders we define a variant of the classic\nShamir, where the Shamir's abscissae are unknown to dealer and shareholders,\nmaking the reconstruction impossible even in the case of dealer and\nshareholders compromised.

In this study, we use a simple solar-wind\npropagation model to develop the first solar-wind variational DA scheme. This\nscheme enables solar-wind observations far from the Sun, such as at 1 AU, to\nupdate and improve the inner boundary conditions of the solar wind model (at\n$30$ solar radii). In this way, observational information can be used to\nimprove estimates of the near-Earth solar wind, even when the observations are\nnot directly downstream of the Earth. Using controlled experiments with\nsynthetic observations we demonstrate this method's potential to improve solar\nwind forecasts, though the best results are achieved in conjunction with\naccurate initial estimates of the solar wind. The variational DA scheme is also\napplied to STEREO in-situ observations using initial solar wind conditions\nsupplied by a coronal model of the observed photospheric magnetic field.

We systematically\nanalyze the incentive compatibility (IC) constraint and individual rationality\n(IR) constraint, which ensure each consumer to choose the data plan with the\nperiod-price combination intended for his type. We further derive the optimal\ncontract that maximizes the SP's expected profit, meanwhile satisfying the IC\nand IR constraints of consumers.

Most of the\ntraditional 3D networks use local spatio-temporal features. We introduce a new\nblock that models correlations between channels of a 3D CNN with respect to\ntemporal and spatial features. This new block can be added as a residual unit\nto different parts of 3D CNNs. We name our novel block 'Spatio-Temporal Channel\nCorrelation' (STC).

Our experiments show that adding STC blocks to current\nstate-of-the-art architectures outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the\nHMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics datasets.

It has been shown in this paper that the intensity undulations in\nmechanically chopped laser pulses are produced by diffraction of light from the\nrotating disc and a detailed explanation of the intensity undulations is given.\nThe experiment provides an efficient method to capture a one dimensional\ndiffraction profile of light from a straight sharp-edge in the time domain. In\naddition, the experiment accurately measured wavelengths of three different\nlaser beams from the undulations in mechanically chopped laser light pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 03:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

Unfortunately,\nelectron acceleration by reconnection is not well understood, yet. In\nparticular, acceleration by turbulent plasmoid reconnection. We have\ninvestigated electron acceleration by turbulent plasmoid reconnection,\ndescribed by MHD simulations, via test particle calculations. In order to avoid\nresolving all relevant turbulence scales down to the dissipation scales, a\nmean-field turbulence model is used to describe the turbulence of sub-grid\nscales (SGS) and their effects via a turbulent electromotive force (EMF). The\nmean-field model describes the turbulent EMF as a function of the mean values\nof current density, vorticity, magnetic field as well as of the energy,\ncross-helicity and residual helicity of the turbulence. We found that, mainly\naround X-points of turbulent reconnection, strongly enhanced localized EMFs\nmost efficiently accelerated electrons and caused the formation of power-law\nspectra. Magnetic-field-aligned EMFs, caused by the turbulence, dominate the\nelectron acceleration process. Scaling the acceleration processes to parameters\nof the Hermean magnetotail, electron energies up to 60 keV can be reached by\nturbulent plasmoid reconnection through the thermal plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

In particular,\nthe Keller's model Keller [1998], the two-layer viscous model [De Carolis and\nDesiderio 2002] and the close-packing model [De Santi and Olla 2017] are\nextensively validated by using wave attenuation data collected during two\ndifferent field campaigns (Weddell Sea, Antarctica, April 2000; western Arctic\nOcean, autumn 2015).\n  We use these data to validate the three models by minimizing the differences\nbetween the measured and model wave attenuation; the retrieved ice thickness is\nthen compared with measured data.\n  The three models allow to fit the observation data, but with important\ndifferences in the three cases. The close-packing model shows good agreement\nwith the data for values of the ice viscosity comparable to those of grease ice\nin laboratory experiments. For thin ice, the Keller's model performance is\nsimilar to that of the close-packing model, while for thick ice much larger\nvalues of the ice viscosity are required, which reflects the different ability\nof the two models to take into account the effect of pancakes. The improvement\nof performance over the Keller's model achieved by the two-layer viscous model\nis minimal, which reflects the marginal role in the dynamics of a finite eddy\nviscosity in the ice-free layer. A good ice thickness retrieval can be obtained\nby considering the ice layer as the only source in the wave dynamics, so that\nthe wind input can be disregarded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Viscosity, ionic conductivity and thermal\nproperties of these electrolytes are compared with well studied 0.2 M salt\ndoped Pyr14TFSI IL-based electrolyte. The highly crystalline 0.6 M lithium salt\ndissolved IL-based electrolytes gradually become amorphous with the increasing\ndispersion of surface functionalized nanoparticles within it. The ionic\nconductivity of the electrolytes shows unusual viscosity decoupled\ncharacteristics and at the 5.0 wt% nanoparticle dispersion it attains a maximum\nvalue, higher than that of pure IL host. As compared to pure IL-based\nelectrolytes, the ionanofluid electrolyte also possesses a significantly higher\nvalue of lithium ion transference number.
