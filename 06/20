The sparsity order of the chosen model serves as an estimate of\nthe model order and the LS fit based only on the active set of the model\nprovides an estimate of the regression parameter vector.

Inspired by this finding, we\nperform direct numerical simulations that excite each mode with body forces\nmatching the shape function from the stability analysis. Relative to the\nbaseline uncontrolled case, the principal wake mode reduces the vortex length,\nwhile the fifth wake mode further shortens the tip vortex. Analogously, the\nstreamwise circulation of the trailing vortex is found to be significantly\nreduced. From these results, we conclude that a rudimentary linear stability\nanalysis can provide key insight into the underlying physics and help engineers\ndesign more effective control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 16:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Library files\nare first compressed, and then cached and delivered using a combination of\ncorrelation-unaware multiple-request cache-aided coded multicast schemes. The\nfirst step uses Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via private\ndescriptions and descriptions that are common to more than one file.

Here we show that there also exist topologically robust\nzero-sum games, such as the rock-paper-scissors game, for which all strategies\ncoexist for all choices of interaction strengths.

Many challenging applications with near real-time requirements --\ne.g. financial fraud detection, recommendation systems, and on-the-fly\nvalidation -- can be captured with graph queries, which are evaluated\nrepeatedly. To ensure quick response time for a changing data set, these\napplications would benefit from applying incremental view maintenance (IVM)\ntechniques, which can perform continuous evaluation of queries and calculate\nthe changes in the result set upon updates. However, currently, no graph\ndatabases provide support for incremental views. While IVM problems have been\nstudied extensively over relational databases, views on property graph queries\nrequire operators outside the scope of standard relational algebra.

The\ncollisional strength of planetesimals determines the planetesimal-depletion\ntimescale, which is prolonged for large planetesiamls. The size of\nplanetesiamls around growing cores is determined by the planetesimal size\ndistribution at the onset of runaway growth. Strong turbulence delays the onset\nof runaway growth, resulting in large planetesimals.

It has been argued that a clear fingerprint of these ideal\nmemristors is a pinched hysteresis loop in their I-V curves. However, a pinched\nI-V hysteresis loop is not a definitive test of whether a resistor with memory\nis truly an ideal memristor because such a property is shared also by other\nresistors whose memory depends on additional internal state variables, other\nthan the charge. Here, we introduce a very simple and {\\it unambiguous} test\nthat can be utilized to check experimentally if a resistor with memory is\nindeed an ideal memristor. Our test is based on the duality property of a\ncapacitor-memristor circuit whereby, for any initial resistance states of the\nmemristor and any form of the applied voltage, the final state of an ideal\nmemristor must be identical to its initial state, if the capacitor charge\nfinally returns to its initial value. In actual experiments, a sufficiently\nwide range of voltage amplitudes and initial states are enough to perform the\ntest.

In particular, the\nultracompact minihalo (UCMH), a dark matter structure hypothesized to possess a\n$\\rho\\propto r^{-9/4}$ density profile due to its formation at $z\\geq 1000$,\nhas been used to establish an upper bound on the primordial power spectrum at\nscales smaller than 2 Mpc. The extreme slope of this density profile amplifies\nthe observational signals of UCMHs. However, we recently showed via N-body\nsimulations that the $\\rho\\propto r^{-9/4}$ density profile does not develop in\nrealistic formation scenarios, throwing UCMH-derived power spectrum constraints\ninto question. Instead, minihalos develop shallower inner profiles with\npower-law indices between $-3/2$ and $-1$. In this paper, we expand on that\nresult and discuss its implications. Using a model that is calibrated to\nsimulation results and predicts halo structures in spiked power spectra based\non their formation times, we calculate new upper bounds on the primordial power\nspectrum based on limits on the dark matter annihilation rate within the\nGalaxy. We find that despite assuming shallower profiles, this minihalo model\nactually yields stronger constraints than the previous UCMH picture owing to\nits inclusion of all minihalos instead of only the earliest-forming ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 18:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

Previous\ncalculations of the expected number of detected Lya-emitting galaxies (LAEs) at\nthis redshift did not explicitly take into account the radiative transfer (RT)\nof Lya. In this work we combine a theoretical model for the halo mass function\nwith numerical results from high-res cosmological hydrosimulations with LyC+Lya\nRT, assessing the visibility of LAEs residing in these halos. Uncertainties\nsuch as cosmic variance and the anisotropic escape of Lya are taken into\naccount, and it is predicted that once the survey has finished, the\nprobabilities of detecting none, one, or more than one are ~90%, ~10%, and ~1%;\na significantly smaller success rate compared to earlier predictions, due to\nthe combined effect of a highly neutral IGM scattering Lya to such large\ndistances from the galaxy that they fall outside the observational aperture,\nand to the actual depth of the survey being less than predicted. Because the\nIGM affects NB and broadband (BB) magnitudes differently, we argue for a\nrelaxed color selection criterion of NB - BB ~ +0.85. But since the flux is\ncontinuum-dominated, even if a galaxy is detectable in the NB its probability\nof being selected as a NB excess object is <~35%. Various properties of\ngalaxies at this redshift are predicted, e.g. UV and Lya LFs, M*-Mh relation,\nspectral shape, optimal aperture, and the anisotropic escape of Lya through\nboth a dusty ISM and a partly neutral IGM. Finally, we describe and publish a\nfast numerical code for adding numbers with asymmetric uncertainties\n(\"x_{-sigma_1}^{+sigma_2}\") proving to be significantly better than the\nstandard, but wrong, way of adding upper and lower uncertainties in quadrature\nseparately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

LLPs\nare a common prediction of a wide range of theories that address unsolved\nfundamental mysteries such as naturalness, dark matter, baryogenesis and\nneutrino masses, and represent a natural and generic possibility for physics\nbeyond the SM (BSM). In most cases the LLP lifetime can be treated as a free\nparameter from the $\\mu$m scale up to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limit of\n$\\sim 10^7$m. Neutral LLPs with lifetimes above $\\sim$ 100m are particularly\ndifficult to probe, as the sensitivity of the LHC main detectors is limited by\nchallenging backgrounds, triggers, and small acceptances. MATHUSLA is a\nproposal for a minimally instrumented, large-volume surface detector near ATLAS\nor CMS. It would search for neutral LLPs produced in HL-LHC collisions by\nreconstructing displaced vertices (DVs) in a low-background environment,\nextending the sensitivity of the main detectors by orders of magnitude in the\nlong-lifetime regime. In this white paper we study the LLP physics\nopportunities afforded by a MATHUSLA-like detector at the HL-LHC. We develop a\nmodel-independent approach to describe the sensitivity of MATHUSLA to BSM LLP\nsignals, and compare it to DV and missing energy searches at ATLAS or CMS. We\nthen explore the BSM motivations for LLPs in considerable detail, presenting a\nlarge number of new sensitivity studies.

The q parameter is\ndetermined by the ratio of disc specific angular momentum to mass. Dark Sage is\nwell suited to our study, as it includes the numerical evolution of\none-dimensional disc structure, making both j_disc and q predicted quantities.\nWe show that Dark Sage produces a clear correlation between gas fraction and\nj_disc at fixed disc mass, in line with recent results from observations and\nhydrodynamic simulations. This translates to a tight q--f_atm sequence for\nstar-forming central galaxies, which closely tracks the analytic prediction of\nObreschkow et al. The scatter in this sequence is driven by the probability\ndistribution function of mass as a function of j (PDF of j) within discs,\nspecifically where it peaks. We find that halo mass is primarily responsible\nfor the peak location of the PDF of j, at least for low values of q. Two main\nmechanisms of equal significance are then identified for disconnecting f_atm\nfrom q. Mergers in the model can trigger quasar winds, with the potential to\nblow out most of the gas disc, while leaving the stellar disc relatively\nunharmed. Ram-pressure stripping of satellite galaxies has a similar effect,\nwhere f_atm can drop drastically with only a minimal effect to q.

Contrastive Hebbian learning, which is a powerful rule inspired by\ngradient backpropagation, is based on Hebb's rule and the contrastive\ndivergence algorithm. It operates in two phases, the forward (or free) phase,\nwhere the data are fed to the network, and a backward (or clamped) phase, where\nthe target signals are clamped to the output layer of the network and the\nfeedback signals are transformed through the transpose synaptic weight\nmatrices. This implies symmetries at the synaptic level, for which there is no\nevidence in the brain. In this work, we propose a new variant of the algorithm,\ncalled random contrastive Hebbian learning, which does not rely on any synaptic\nweights symmetries. Instead, it uses random matrices to transform the feedback\nsignals during the clamped phase, and the neural dynamics are described by\nfirst order non-linear differential equations. The algorithm is experimentally\nverified by solving a Boolean logic task, classification tasks (handwritten\ndigits and letters), and an autoencoding task.

The beamforming vector of the statistically optimal beamformer is\ncomputed by utilizing speech and noise masks, which are estimated by a neural\nnetwork. The proposed adaptation approach is based on the integration of the\nbeamformer, which includes the mask estimation network, and the acoustic model\nof the ASR system. This allows for the propagation of the training error, from\nthe acoustic modeling cost function, all the way through the beamforming\noperation and through the mask estimation network. By using the results of a\nfirst pass recognition and by keeping all other parameters fixed, the mask\nestimation network can therefore be fine tuned by retraining. Utterances of a\nspeaker of interest can thus be used in a two pass approach, to optimize the\nbeamforming for the speech characteristics of that specific speaker.

The\nexact shape of this fall-off, and its dependence on the wavelength of light, is\nthe intra-pixel response function (IPRF).

Earlier,\nhigher frequency radio continuum, recombination line, and infrared data had\ncorrectly inferred the presence of nonthermal radio emission within a large\ncomplex including ionised nebulae and active star formation. However, our\nobservations have allowed us to redefine at least one SNR as a relatively small\nsource (7'.5 x 3' in size) located at the southern periphery of the originally\ndefined SNR candidate. The integrated flux density of G51.04 at 74 MHz is 6.1\n+/- 0.8 Jy, while its radio continuum spectrum has a slope alpha=-0.52 +/-\n0.05, typical of a shell-type remnant. We also measured spatial variations in\nthe spectral index between 74 and 1400~MHz across the source, ranging from a\nsteeper spectrum (alpha~-0.50) coincident with the brightest emission to a\nflatter component (alpha~-0.30) in the surrounding fainter region.

The objective of this\nstudy was to investigate various failure mechanisms (e.g. failure of collagen\nfibers) responsible for arterial interfacial delamination. In-situ tensile\ntests of fibers were performed on a micro-tester in the scanning electron\nmicroscope.

Novel cytotoxic drugs and molecularly targeted\ndrugs are commonly administered as part of cancer therapy. Both types of drugs\nare susceptible to various mechanisms of drug resistance, obstructing or\npreventing a successful outcome. In this paper, we develop a cancer growth\nmodel that accounts for the competition between cancer cells and healthy cells.\nThe model incorporates resistance to both cytotoxic and targeted drugs. In both\ncases, the level of drug resistance is assumed to be a continuous variable\nranging from fully-sensitive to fully-resistant. Using our model we demonstrate\nthat when the competition is moderate, therapies using both drugs are more\neffective compared with single drug therapies.

In this case,\ntherapies that are initiated with a targeted drug and are exposed to it for a\nsufficiently long time are shown to have better outcomes. The results of the\nstudy stress the importance of adjusting the therapy to the pre-treatment\nresistance levels.

This large register set is a\nburden for operating systems, as its content needs to be saved and restored\nwhen the operating system context switches between tasks. As an optimization,\nthe operating system can defer the context switch of the FPU and SIMD register\nset until the first instruction is executed that needs access to these\nregisters. Meanwhile, the old content is left in place with the hope that the\ncurrent task might not use these registers at all. This optimization is\ncommonly called lazy FPU context switching. To make it possible, a processor\noffers the ability to toggle the availability of instructions utilizing\nfloating point and SIMD registers. If the instructions are turned off, any\nattempt of executing them will generate a fault.\n  In this paper, we present an attack that exploits lazy FPU context switching\nand allows an adversary to recover the FPU and SIMD register set of arbitrary\nprocesses or VMs. The attack works on processors that transiently execute FPU\nor SIMD instructions that follow an instruction generating the fault indicating\nthe first use of FPU or SIMD instructions. On operating systems using lazy FPU\ncontext switching, the FPU and SIMD register content of other processes or\nvirtual machines can then be reconstructed via cache side effects.\n  With SIMD registers not only being used for cryptographic computation, but\nalso increasingly for simple operations, such as copying memory, we argue that\nlazy FPU context switching is a dangerous optimization that needs to be turned\noff in all operating systems, if there is a chance that they run on affected\nprocessors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 21:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-21"}

In clinical settings, this is done\nby manually manoeuvring a 2D probe to the desired scan plane. With the advent\nof 3D US, the entire fetal brain volume containing these standard planes can be\neasily acquired. However, manual standard plane identification in 3D volume is\nlabour-intensive and requires expert knowledge of fetal anatomy. We propose a\nnew Iterative Transformation Network (ITN) for the automatic detection of\nstandard planes in 3D volumes. ITN uses a convolutional neural network to learn\nthe relationship between a 2D plane image and the transformation parameters\nrequired to move that plane towards the location/orientation of the standard\nplane in the 3D volume. During inference, the current plane image is passed\niteratively to the network until it converges to the standard plane location.\nWe explore the effect of using different transformation representations as\nregression outputs of ITN. Under a multi-task learning framework, we introduce\nadditional classification probability outputs to the network to act as\nconfidence measures for the regressed transformation parameters in order to\nfurther improve the localisation accuracy.

Automatic MCE perfusion quantification is challenging\nand requires accurate segmentation of the myocardium from noisy and\ntime-varying images. Random forests (RF) have been successfully applied to many\nmedical image segmentation tasks. However, the pixel-wise RF classifier ignores\ncontextual relationships between label outputs of individual pixels. RF which\nonly utilizes local appearance features is also susceptible to data suffering\nfrom large intensity variations. In this paper, we demonstrate how to overcome\nthe above limitations of classic RF by presenting a fully automatic\nsegmentation pipeline for myocardial segmentation in full-cycle 2D MCE data.\nSpecifically, a statistical shape model is used to provide shape prior\ninformation that guide the RF segmentation in two ways. First, a novel shape\nmodel (SM) feature is incorporated into the RF framework to generate a more\naccurate RF probability map. Second, the shape model is fitted to the RF\nprobability map to refine and constrain the final segmentation to plausible\nmyocardial shapes. We further improve the performance by introducing a bounding\nbox detection algorithm as a preprocessing step in the segmentation pipeline.\nOur approach on 2D image is further extended to 2D+t sequence which ensures\ntemporal consistency in the resultant sequence segmentations. When evaluated on\nclinical MCE data, our proposed method achieves notable improvement in\nsegmentation accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods including\nthe classic RF and its variants, active shape model and image registration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 23:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-21"}

Our problem differs from Dybvig's also in that the\ntime of ruin could be finite in our setting, whereas ruin was impossible in\nDybvig's work.

Recent advances in information and communication technologies enable\ncollection of real-time information from various sources.

On one hand, inadequate situation awareness in disasters has\nbeen identified as one of the primary factors in human errors with grave\nconsequences such as loss of lives and destruction of critical infrastructure.\nOn the other hand, the growing ubiquity of social media and mobile devices, and\npervasive nature of the Internet-of-Things means that there are more sources of\noutbound traffic, which ultimately results in the creation of a data deluge,\nbeginning shortly after the onset of disaster events, leading to the problem of\ninformation tsunami.

The expectation\n(E) step of EM-type algorithms is time-consuming in massive data applications\nbecause it requires multiple passes through the full data. We address this\nproblem by proposing an asynchronous and distributed generalization of the EM\ncalled the Distributed EM (DEM). Using DEM, existing EM-type algorithms are\neasily extended to massive data settings by exploiting the divide-and-conquer\ntechnique and widely available computing power, such as grid computing. The DEM\nalgorithm reserves two groups of computing processes called \\emph{workers} and\n\\emph{managers} for performing the E step and the maximization step (M step),\nrespectively. The samples are randomly partitioned into a large number of\ndisjoint subsets and are stored on the worker processes. The E step of DEM\nalgorithm is performed in parallel on all the workers, and every worker\ncommunicates its results to the managers at the end of local E step. The\nmanagers perform the M step after they have received results from a\n$\\gamma$-fraction of the workers, where $\\gamma$ is a fixed constant in $(0,\n1]$. The sequence of parameter estimates generated by the DEM algorithm retains\nthe attractive properties of EM: convergence of the sequence of parameter\nestimates to a local mode and linear global rate of convergence.

In\nthis paper, we consider a strong coupling U(1)$_{v}\\times $SU(2)$_{s}$\nsymmetric spin-valley model to obtain the correlated insulating state and the\npairing instability near quarter filling.

Rocks often have oriented magnetic fabrics, which can be interpreted as\nconnected to ductile deformation before cementation of the sediment. This paper\nreports a novel statistical procedure for simultaneous evaluation of AMS\n(Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility) and fault-slip data.The new method\nanalyzes the AMS data, without linearization techniques, so that weak AMS\nlineation and rotational AMS can be assessed that are beyond the scope of\nclassical methods. This idea is extended to the evaluation of fault-slip data.\nWhile the traditional assumptions of stress inversion are not rejected, the\nmethod recovers the stress field via statistical hypothesis testing. In\naddition it provides statistical information needed for the combined evaluation\nof the AMS and the mesotectonic (0.1 to 10m) data. In the combined evaluation a\nstatistical test is carried out that helps to decide if the AMS lineation and\nthe mesotectonic markers (in case of repeated deformation of the oldest set of\nmarkers) were formed in the same or different deformation phases. If this\ncondition is met, the combined evaluation can improve the precision of the\nreconstruction. When the two data sets do not have a common solution for the\ndirection of the extension, the deformational origin of the AMS is\nquestionable. In this case the orientation of the stress field responsible for\nthe AMS lineation might be different from that which caused the brittle\ndeformation. Although most of the examples demonstrate the reconstruction of\nweak deformations in sediments, the new method is readily applicable to\ninvestigate the ductile-brittle transition of any rock formation as long as AMS\nand fault-slip data are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 07:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-21"}

In this work, we use two\nlaser beams, positioned orthogonally to illuminate the fibre from two sides,\nand calculate deviations from the expected geometry by analysing the scattering\npattern. To measure the diffraction pattern we use two 8K linear array\ndetectors, with the scattered light incident directly on the sensors. Each\ndetector is capturing approximately 90 degree angular range directly behind the\nfibre. The two measurement channels are positioned at different heights. The\nscattered pattern is modelled mathematically with finite-element and\nFourier-modal methods, with various diameter and concentricity deviations. The\nsensitivities of the changes in the scattering pattern are identified in\nrespect to these deviations. Since calculations are computationally intensive,\nthe sensitivities are pre-calculated in advance, and the real-time measurement\nis based on pattern recognition. The symmetry of the pattern is used to\ndifferentiate between diameter and concentricity variations.

In this paper, we introduce Competitive Learning\nRiemannian Quantization (CLRQ), an online algorithm that computes the optimal\nsummary when the data does not belong to a vector space, but rather a\nRiemannian manifold. We prove its convergence and show simulated examples on\nthe sphere and the hyperbolic plane.

These summaries are representative of the\nair traffic complexity and yield clusterings of the airspaces into zones that\nare homogeneous with respect to that criterion.

The notion of $p$-sum appears in the Brunn-Minkowski-Firey\ntheory in convex analysis, and generalizes several well-known set-valued\noperations such as the Minkowski sum of the summand convex sets (here,\nellipsoids). We derive an outer ellipsoidal parameterization for the $p$-sum of\na given set of ellipsoids, and compute the tightest such parameterization for\ntwo optimality criteria: minimum trace and minimum volume. For such optimal\nparameterizations, several known results in the system-control literature are\nrecovered as special cases of our general formula.

We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture\nthe dependence structure between gold returns and changes in uncertainty under\ndifferent gold market conditions, while considering the nuances of uncertainty\nlevels. To capture the core uncertainty effects on gold returns, a dynamic\nfactor model is used. This technique allows summarizing the impact of six\ndifferent indexes (namely economic, macroeconomic, microeconomic, monetary\npolicy, financial and political uncertainties) within one aggregate measure of\nuncertainty. In doing so, we show that the gold's role as a hedge and safe\nhaven cannot be assumed to hold at all times. This ability seems to be\nsensitive to the gold's various market states (bearish, normal or bullish) and\nto whether the uncertainty is low, middle or high. Interestingly, we find a\npositive and strong relationship between gold returns and the uncertainty\ncomposite indicator when the uncertainty attains its highest level and under\nnormal gold market scenario. This suggests that holding a diversified portfolio\ncomposed of gold could help protecting against exposure to uncertain risks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 09:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-21"}

In this work we study phenomenological but physically motivated\nclasses of models in which the dark energy equation of state can undergo a\nrapid transition at low redshifts, perhaps associated with the onset of the\nacceleration phase itself. Through a standard statistical analysis we have used\nlow-redshift cosmological data, coming from Type Ia supernova and Hubble\nparameter measurements, to set constraints on the steepness of these possible\ntransitions as well as on the present-day values of the dark energy equation of\nstate and in the asymptotic past in these models. We have also studied the way\nin which these constraints depend on the specific parametrisation being used.\nOur results confirm that such late-time transitions are strongly constrained.\nIf one demands a matter-like pre-transition behaviour, then the transition is\nconstrained to occur at high redshifts (effectively in the matter era), while\nif the pre-transition equation of state is a free parameter then it is\nconstrained to be close to that of a cosmological constant. In any case, the\nvalue of dark energy equation of state near the present day must also be very\nsimilar to that of a cosmological constant. The overall conclusion is that any\nsignificant deviations from this behaviour can only occur in the deep matter\nera, so there is no evidence for a transition associated with the onset of\nacceleration. Observational tools capable of probing the dynamics of the\nuniverse in the deep matter era are therefore particularly important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 10:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Crater scaling laws allow us to extract information about the impact\nhistories on the host bodies. The pi-group scaling laws have been constructed\nbased on the point-source approximation, dimensional analysis, and the results\nfrom impact experiments. Recent impact experiments, however, demonstrated that\nthe scaling parameters themselves exhibits complex behavior against the change\nin the impact conditions and target properties. Here, we propose an\nalternative, fully analytical method to predict impact outcomes based on impact\ncratering mechanics. This approach is based on the Maxwell Z-model and the\nresidual velocity. We present analytical expressions of (1) the proportionality\nrelation between the ejection velocity and the ejection position, (2) the\nradius of a growing crater as a function of time, and (3) the transient crater\nradii. Since we focused on obtaining analytical solutions, a number of\nsimplifications are employed. Due to the simplifications in the strength model,\nthe accuracy of the prediction in the strength-dominated regime is relatively\nlow. Our model reproduces the power-law behavior of the ejecta velocity\ndistribution and the approximate time variation of a growing crater. The\npredicted radii under typical impact conditions mostly converge to a region\nbetween the two typical scaling lines by the pi-group scaling laws, strongly\nsupporting the notion that the new method is one of the simplest ways to\npredict impact outcomes, as it provides analytical solutions.

The tidal mass loss helps the\nclumps to significantly slow down or even halt their inward migration at a\ndistance of a few tens of AU from the protostar. The resulting clumps are\nheavily truncated both in mass and size compared to their wider-orbit\ncounterparts, keeping only a dense and hot nucleus.

The most\nprecise SFHs are usually derived from deep but not very spatially extended\nphotometric data; this might alter the ratio of old to young stars when age\ngradients are present. Here we correct for this effect and derive the mass\nformed in stars by $z=2$ for a sample of 16 Local Group dwarf galaxies. We\nexplore early differences between ${\\it fast}$ and ${\\it slow}$ dwarfs, and\nevaluate the impact of internal feedback by supernovae (SN) on the baryonic and\ndark matter (DM) component of the dwarfs. ${\\it Fast}$ dwarfs assembled more\nstellar mass at early times and have larger amounts of DM within the half-light\nradius than ${\\it slow}$ dwarfs. By imposing that ${\\it slow}$ dwarfs cannot\nhave lost their gas by $z=2$, we constrain the maximum coupling efficiency of\nSN feedback to the gas and to the DM to be $\\sim$10%. We find that internal\nfeedback alone appears insufficient to quench the SFH of ${\\it fast}$ dwarfs by\ngas deprivation, in particular for the fainter systems. Nonetheless, SN\nfeedback can core the DM halo density profiles relatively easily, producing\ncores of the sizes of the half-light radius in ${\\it fast}$ dwarfs by $z=2$\nwith very low efficiencies. Amongst the \"classical\" Milky Way satellites, we\npredict that the smallest cores should be found in Draco and Ursa Minor, while\nSculptor and Fornax should host the largest ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 12:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Tidal invariants built up with the Riemann\ntensor and their derivatives evaluated along the world line of the body are\nessential tools to investigate both geometrical and physical properties of the\ntidal interaction. For example, one can determine the tidal potential in the\nneighborhood of the body by constructing a body-fixed frame, which requires\nFermi-type coordinates attached to the body itself, the latter being in turn\nrelated to the spacetime metric and curvature along the considered world line.\nSimilarly, in an effective field theory description of extended bodies finite\nsize effects are taken into account by adding to the point mass action certain\nnon-minimal couplings which involve integrals of tidal invariants along the\norbit of the body. In both cases such a computation of tidal tensors is\nrequired. Here we consider the case of a spinning body also endowed with a\nnon-vanishing quadrupole moment in a Kerr spacetime. The structure of the body\nis modeled by a multipolar expansion around the \"center of mass line\" according\nto the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon model truncated at the quadrupolar order. The\nquadrupole tensor is assumed to be quadratic in spin, accounting for rotational\ndeformations. The behavior of tidal invariants of both electric and magnetic\ntype is discussed in terms of gauge-invariant quantities when the body is\nmoving along a circular orbit as well as in the case of an arbitrary\n(equatorial) motion. The analysis is completed by examining the associated\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of the tidal tensors.

In accordance with the GL theory, it is shown that the\nboundary-layer thicknesses of the velocity and temperature fields in vertical\nnatural convection obey laminar-like Prandtl-Blasius-Pohlhausen scaling.\nSpecifically, the normalised mean boundary-layer thicknesses scale with the\n$-1/2$-power of a wind-based Reynolds number, where the \"wind\" of the GL theory\nis interpreted as the maximum mean velocity. Away from the walls, the\ndissipation of the turbulent fluctuations, which can be interpreted as the\n\"bulk\" or \"background\" dissipation of the GL theory, is found to obey the\nKolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin scaling for fully developed turbulence.

These new estimates are used to obtain\nsharp results for quasilinear IBVP and transmission problems, and for fixed,\nmoving, and free boundaries.

Several applications that fall into this category are considered: the\ninteraction of waves with a lateral piston, and a new version of the well-known\nstability of shocks (classical and undercompressive) that improves the results\nof the general theory by taking advantage of the specificities of the\none-dimensional case.

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar\nmedium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS,\nH$_2$CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species.

With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:11:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 08:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Hybrid magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy\nsystems have the potential to control for intrafraction motion.

We extend SOPI here to permit dynamic updating of\nslice positions in one plane while keeping the other plane position fixed. In\nthis implementation, cine images from the static plane are used for motion\nmonitoring and as image navigators to sort stepped images in the other plane,\nproducing dynamic 4D image volumes for use in dose reconstruction. A custom\n3D-printed target filled with radiochromic FXG gel was interfaced to a dynamic\nmotion phantom. 4D-SOPI was acquired in a dynamic motion phantom driven by an\nactual patient respiratory waveform displaying amplitude/frequency variations\nand drifting and in a healthy volunteer. Unique 4D-MRI epochs were\nreconstructed from a time series of phantom motion. Dose from a static 4cmx15cm\nfield was calculated on each 4D respiratory phase bin and epoch image, scaled\nby the time spent in each bin, and then rigidly accumulated. The phantom was\nthen positioned on an Elekta MR Linac and irradiated while moving. Following\nirradiation, actual dose deposited to the FXG gel was determined by applying a\nR1 versus dose calibration curve to R1 maps of the phantom. The 4D-SOPI cine\nimages produced a respiratory motion navigator that was highly correlated with\nthe actual phantom motion (CC=0.9981). The mean difference between the\naccumulated and measured dose inside the target was 4.4% of the maximum\nprescribed dose.

However, the\nrobustness of DL systems recently receives great concerns, such as adversarial\nexamples against computer vision systems, which could potentially result in\nsevere consequences. Adopting testing techniques could help to evaluate the\nrobustness of a DL system and therefore detect vulnerabilities at an early\nstage. The main challenge of testing such systems is that its runtime state\nspace is too large: if we view each neuron as a runtime state for DL, then a DL\nsystem often contains massive states, rendering testing each state almost\nimpossible. For traditional software, combinatorial testing (CT) is an\neffective testing technique to reduce the testing space while obtaining\nrelatively high defect detection abilities. In this paper, we perform an\nexploratory study of CT on DL systems. We adapt the concept in CT and propose a\nset of coverage criteria for DL systems, as well as a CT coverage guided test\ngeneration technique. Our evaluation demonstrates that CT provides a promising\navenue for testing DL systems.

The PHENIX detector at the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider is well suited to study potential effects from color flow.\nAngular correlations between nearly back-to-back hadrons or a direct\nphoton-hadron are measured to study the prediction of color entanglement or\nfactorization breaking. The correlations can be treated in a\ntransverse-momentum-dependent framework where sensitivity to non-Abelian\neffects from color are predicted. These measurements are the first ever to\nsearch for experimental evidence of these entangled states and will help\nestablish color flow in hadronic interactions as a new area of focus within QCD\nresearch.

This paper studies an equally important but much less\ninvestigated problem of service hosting where FNs are adaptively configured to\nhost services for Sensor Nodes (SNs), thereby enabling corresponding tasks to\nbe executed by the FNs. The problem of service hosting emerges because of the\nlimited computational and storage resources at FNs, which limit the number of\ndifferent types of services that can be hosted by an FN at the same time.\nConsidering the variability of service demand in both temporal and spatial\ndimensions, when, where, and which services to host have to be judiciously\ndecided to maximize the utility of the Fog computing network. Our proposed Fog\nconfiguration strategies are tailored to battery-powered FNs. The limited\nbattery capacity of FNs creates a long-term energy budget constraint that\nsignificantly complicates the Fog configuration problem as it introduces\ntemporal coupling of decision making across the timeline. To address all these\nchallenges, we propose an online distributed algorithm, called Adaptive Fog\nConfiguration (AFC), based on Lyapunov optimization and parallel Gibbs\nsampling.

In a previous work, the\nauthors studied the effects of a periodic forcing in the decay law of the\nsurvival probability, and they characterized the global properties of escape\ndynamics. In the present paper, we add two important issues in the effects of\nperiodic forcing: the fractal dimension of the set of singularities in the\nscattering function, and the unpredictability of the exit basins, which is\nestimated by using the concept of basin entropy. Both the fractal dimension and\nthe basin entropy exhibit a resonant-like decrease as the forcing frequency\nincreases. We provide a theoretical reasoning, which could justify this\ndecreasing in the fractality near the main resonant frequency, that appears for\n$\\omega \\approx 1$. We attribute the decrease in the basin entropy to the\nreduction of the area occupied by the KAM islands and the basin boundaries when\nthe frequency is close to the resonance. Finally, the decay rate of the\nexponential decay law shows a minimum value of the amplitude, $A_c$, which\nreflects the complete destruction of the KAM islands in the resonance.

For the head-on collisions, we show that the\nend point and the gravitational waveform from these collisions depends on the\ncompactness of the Proca star.

But more compact Proca stars\ncollide to form a transient ${\\it hypermassive}$ Proca star, which ends up\ndecaying into a black hole, albeit temporarily surrounded by Proca quasi-bound\nstates. The unstable intermediate stage can leave an imprint in the waveform,\nmaking it distinct from that of a head-on collision of black holes.

For the orbital mergers, the outcome also\ndepends on the compactness of the stars. For most compact stars, the binary\nmerger forms a Kerr black hole which retains part of the initial orbital\nangular momentum, being surrounded by a transient Proca field remnant; in cases\nwith lower compactness, the binary merger forms a massive Proca star with\nangular momentum, but out of equilibrium.

Here\nwe have developed a reference-free and alignment-free machine learning method,\nDeepVirFinder, for predicting viral sequences in metagenomic data using deep\nlearning techniques. DeepVirFinder was trained based on a large number of viral\nsequences discovered before May 2015. Evaluated on the sequences after that\ndate, DeepVirFinder outperformed the state-of-the-art method VirFinder at all\ncontig lengths. Enlarging the training data by adding millions of purified\nviral sequences from environmental metavirome samples significantly improves\nthe accuracy for predicting under-represented viruses. Applying DeepVirFinder\nto real human gut metagenomic samples from patients with colorectal carcinoma\n(CRC) identified 51,138 viral sequences belonging to 175 bins. Ten bins were\nassociated with the cancer status, indicating their potential use for\nnon-invasive diagnosis of CRC. In summary, DeepVirFinder greatly improved the\nprecision and recall rates of viral identification, and it will significantly\naccelerate the discovery rate of viruses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 15:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-21"}

Double phase retrieval is a recently proposed efficient method\nwhich recovers the unknown object from its phaseless measurements by two steps\nwith phase retrieval.\n  In this paper, we combine the two steps in double phase retrieval and\nconstruct an end-to-end neural network called TCNN(Transforming Convolutional\nNeural Network) which directly learns the relationship between the phaseless\nmeasurements and the object. TCNN contains a special layer called transform\nlayer which aims to be a bridge between different transform domains. Tested by\nthe empirical data provided in\\cite{Metzler2017Coherent}, images can be\nrecovered by TCNN with comparable quality compared with state-of-the-art\nmethods.

The first step is to use a radial basis\nfunction to construct a density distribution from the data. A potential\nfunction is then constructed such that this density distribution is the ground\nstate solution to the time-independent Schrodinger equation. The second step is\nto use this potential function with the Langevin dynamics at sub-critical\ntemperature to avoid ergodicity. The Langevin equations take a classical Gibbs\ndistribution as the invariant measure, where the peaks of the distribution\ncoincide with minima of the potential surface. The time dynamics of individual\ndata points lead to different metastable states, which are interpreted as\ncluster centers. Clustering is therefore achieved when subsets of the data\naggregate - as a result of the Langevin dynamics for a moderate period of time\n- in the neighborhood of a particular potential minimum. While the data points\nare pushed towards potential minima by the potential gradient, Brownian motion\nallows them to effectively tunnel through local potential barriers and escape\nsaddle points into locations of the potential surface otherwise forbidden. The\nalgorithm's feasibility is first established based on several illustrating\nexamples and theoretical analyses, followed by a stricter evaluation using a\nstandard benchmark dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 14:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

Clinical monitoring of mood is key to the care of these dynamic and\nincapacitating mood states. Frequent and detailed monitoring improves clinical\nsensitivity to detect mood state changes, but typically requires costly and\nlimited resources. Speech characteristics change during both depressed and\nmanic states, suggesting automatic methods applied to the speech signal can be\neffectively used to monitor mood state changes. However, speech is modulated by\nmany factors, which renders mood state prediction challenging. We hypothesize\nthat emotion can be used as an intermediary step to improve mood state\nprediction.

Existing methods for measuring precipitation are\nsubject to spatial and temporal uncertainties that compromise high-precision\napplications like flash flood forecasting.
