The scales of the processes\ninvolved span orders of magnitudes, making the problem computationally\nimpossible to ever fully resolve in full star simulations in the present and\nnear future. In the lower density regions of the star, the curvature of the\ndetonation front will slow the detonation, affecting the production of\nintermediate mass elements. We find that shock strengthening due to the density\ngradient present in the outer layers of the progenitor is essential for\nunderstanding the nucleosynthesis there, with burning extending well below the\ndensity at which a steady-state detonation is extinct. We show that a complete\nreaction network is not sufficient to obtain physical detonations at high\ndensities and modest resolution due to numerical mixing at the unresolved\nreaction front. At low densities, below 6$\\times$10$^{5}$ g cm$^{-3}$, it is\npossible to achieve high enough resolution to separate the shock and the\nreaction region,and the abundance structure predicted by fully resolved\nquasi-steady-state calculations is obtained. For our best current benchmark\nyields, we utilize a method in which the unresolved portion of Lagrangian\nhistories are reconstructed based on fully resolved quasi-steady-state\ndetonation calculations.

It is generally assumed that these\nsolvents do not interact strongly with the layer and so their effects can be\nneglected.

The\nlatter are related to bias problems in temporal difference (TD) learning and to\nhigh variance problems in Monte Carlo (MC) learning. Both problems are even\nmore severe when rewards are delayed. RUDDER aims at making the expected future\nrewards zero, which simplifies Q-value estimation to computing the mean of the\nimmediate reward. We propose the following two new concepts to push the\nexpected future rewards toward zero. (i) Reward redistribution that leads to\nreturn-equivalent decision processes with the same optimal policies and, when\noptimal, zero expected future rewards. (ii) Return decomposition via\ncontribution analysis which transforms the reinforcement learning task into a\nregression task at which deep learning excels.

This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The local nature of self-energy allows us to combine it with\nkernel polynomial method and transfer matrix methods. The locality of\nself-energy combined with the analytic nature of the strong- coupling\nperturbation theory enables us to study lattices with millions of sites. The\ntransfer matrix method in the ribbon geometry is essentially free from finite\nsize errors and allows us to perform a careful finite size scaling of the width\nof the ribbon.

The\n$I_{\\rm HCN}/I_{\\rm HCO+}$ values are within the range seen in other galaxies,\nbut are most similar to those seen in other low metallicity sources and in\nstarbursts. The detections follow the fiducial $L_{\\rm IR}$-$L_{\\rm HCN}$ and\n$L_{\\rm IR}$-$L_{\\rm HCO+}$ relationships. These trends suggest that HCN and\nHCO+ can be used to trace dense molecular gas at metallicities of 1/4\n$Z_\\odot$, to first order. The dense gas fraction is similar to that in spiral\ngalaxies, but lower than that in U/LIRGs. The dense molecular gas star\nformation efficiency, however, is on the upper end of those in normal galaxies\nand consistent with those in U/LIRGs. These results suggest that the CO and\nHCN/HCO+ emission occupy the same relative volumes as at higher metallicity,\nbut that the entire emitting structure is reduced in size. Dense gas mass\nestimates for high redshift galaxies may need to be corrected for this effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 20:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The pumps moving water from\nreservoirs to tanks and consumers, can serve as energy storage alternatives if\nproperly operated. Nevertheless, optimal WDS scheduling is challenged by the\nhydraulic law, according to which the pressure along a pipe drops\nproportionally to its squared water flow. The optimal water flow (OWF) task is\nformulated here as a mixed-integer non-convex problem incorporating flow and\npressure constraints, critical for the operation of fixed-speed pumps, tanks,\nreservoirs, and pipes. The hydraulic constraints of the OWF problem are\nsubsequently relaxed to second-order cone constraints. To restore feasibility\nof the original non-convex constraints, a penalty term is appended to the\nobjective of the relaxed OWF. The modified problem can be solved as a\nmixed-integer second-order cone program, which is analytically shown to yield\nWDS-feasible minimizers under certain sufficient conditions. Under these\nconditions, by suitably weighting the penalty term, the minimizers of the\nrelaxed problem can attain arbitrarily small optimality gaps, thus providing\nOWF solutions. Numerical tests using real-world demands and prices on benchmark\nWDS demonstrate the relaxation to be exact even for setups where the sufficient\nconditions are not met.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 21:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 18:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Proton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with\nany brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown\nmediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can\nact as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that today's NMR signals\ncan contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain\nenvironment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence\n(ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR\ndetection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we\nfound evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal\nappearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those\nsignals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the\nevoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or\nelectrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only\nappeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced.

In this work we present a proposed reversible logic, including gate\nsimulations and schematics under the name of Reversible Fluxon Logic (RFL). In\nthe widest sense it is related to SFQ-logic, however it relies on (some\napproximately) reversible gate dynamics and promises higher efficiency than\nconventional SFQ which is logically irreversible. Our gates use fluxons, a type\nof SFQ which has topological-particle characteristics in an undamped Long\nJosephson junction (LJJ). The collective dynamics of the component Josephson\njunctions (JJs) enable ballistic fluxon motion within LJJs as well as good\nenergy preservation of the fluxon for JJ-circuit gates. For state changes, the\ngates induce switching of fluxon polarity during resonant scattering at an\ninterface between different LJJs. Related to the ballistic nature of fluxons in\nLJJ, the gates are powered, almost ideally, only by data fluxon momentum in\nstark contrast to conventionally damped logic gates which are powered\ncontinuously with a bias. At first the fundamental Identity and NOT gates are\nintroduced. Then 2-bit gates are discussed, including the IDSN gate which\nactually allows low fluxon-number inputs for more than 4 input states. A\ndigital CNOT, an important milestone for 2-bit reversible superconducting\ngates, is planned as a central result. It uses a store and launch gate to stop\nand then later route a fluxon.

We revisited the activity-age relation\nusing time-series observations of a large sample of solar twins whose precise\nisochronal ages and other important physical parameters have been determined.\nWe measured the Ca II H and K activity indices using 9000 HARPS spectra of 82\nsolar twins. We measured an average solar activity of $S_{\\rm MW}$ = 0.1712\n$\\pm$ 0.0017 during solar magnetic cycles 23$-$24 covered by HARPS observations\nand we also inferred an average of $S_{\\rm MW}$ = 0.1694 $\\pm$ 0.0025 for\ncycles 10$-$24, anchored on a S index vs. sunspot number correlation. Also, a\nsimple relation between the average and dispersion of the activity levels of\nsolar twins was found. This enabled us to predict the stellar variability\neffects on the age-activity diagram and, consequently, estimate the\nchromospheric age uncertainties due to the same phenomena. The age-activity\nrelation is still statistically significant up to ages around 6$-$7 Gyr, in\nagreement with previous works using open clusters and field stars with precise\nages. Our research confirms that Ca II H \\& K lines remain a useful\nchromospheric evolution tracer until stars reach ages of at least 6$-$7 Gyr. We\nfound an evidence that, for the most homogeneous set of old stars, the\nchromospheric activity indices seem to continue decreasing after the solar age\ntowards the end of the main-sequence. Our results indicate that a significant\npart of the scatter observed in the age-activity relation of solar twins can be\nattributed to stellar cycle modulations effects.

In this system, strategic customers must\ndecide whether to reserve a server in advance (thereby gaining higher priority)\nor avoid AR. Reserving a server in advance bears a cost. In this paper, we\nconduct a game-theoretic analysis of this system, characterizing the\nequilibrium strategies. Specifically, we show that the game has two types of\nequilibria. In one type, none of the customers makes reservation. In the other\ntype, only customers that realize early enough that they will need service make\nreservations. We show that the types and number of equilibria depend on the\nparameters of the queue and on the reservation cost. Specifically, we prove\nthat the equilibrium is unique if the server utilization is below 1/2.\nOtherwise, there may be multiple equilibria depending on the reservation cost.\nNext, we assume that the reservation cost is a fee set by the provider. In that\ncase, we show that the revenue maximizing fee leads to a unique equilibrium if\nthe utilization is below 2/3, but multiple equilibria if the utilization\nexceeds 2/3. Finally, we study a dynamic version of the game, where users learn\nand adapt their strategies based on observations of past actions or strategies\nof other users. Depending on the type of learning (i.e., action learning vs.\\\nstrategy learning), we show that the game converges to an equilibrium in some\ncases, while it cycles in other cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 23:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

We demonstrate gradient adversarial training for three\ndifferent scenarios: (1) as a defense to adversarial examples we classify\ngradient tensors and tune them to be agnostic to the class of their\ncorresponding example, (2) for knowledge distillation, we do binary\nclassification of gradient tensors derived from the student or teacher network\nand tune the student gradient tensor to mimic the teacher's gradient tensor;\nand (3) for multi-task learning we classify the gradient tensors derived from\ndifferent task loss functions and tune them to be statistically\nindistinguishable.

Rather than attempt to infer the true $\\lambda$\nposterior, we here compute the relative change to $\\lambda$ when new\nexperimental/observational evidence is introduced. By simulating posterior\ndistributions and resulting entropic information gains, we compare three\nexperimental pressures on $\\lambda$: 1) evidence for an earlier start to life;\n$t_{\\mathrm{obs}}$; 2) constraints on spontaneous abiogenesis from the lab; and\n3) an exoplanet survey for biosignatures.

In active inference, action selection is driven by an\nobjective function that evaluates possible future actions with respect to\ncurrent, inferred beliefs about the world. Active inference at its core is\nindependent from extrinsic rewards, resulting in a high level of robustness\nacross e.g.\\ different environments or agent morphologies. In the literature,\nparadigms that share this independence have been summarised under the notion of\nintrinsic motivations. In general and in contrast to active inference, these\nmodels of motivation come without a commitment to particular inference and\naction selection mechanisms.

The\nquantization of network parameters and the processed data has proven a valuable\nmeasure to reduce the challenges of network inference so effectively that the\nfeasible scope of applications is expanded even into the embedded domain. This\npaper describes the making of a real-time object detection in a live video\nstream processed on an embedded all-programmable device.

Treating this special case as a\nregular SCSS problem where in all constituent sources are given equal priority\nin terms of reconstruction may result in a suboptimal separation performance.\nIn this paper, we tackle the one source separation problem by suitably\nmodifying the orthodox SCSS framework and focus only on one source at a time.\nThe proposed approach is a generic framework that can be applied to any\nexisting SCSS algorithm, improves performance, and scales well when there are\nmore than two sources in the mixture unlike most existing SCSS methods.\nAdditionally, existing SCSS algorithms rely on fine hyper-parameter tuning\nhence making them difficult to use in practice. Our framework takes a step\ntowards automatic tuning of the hyper-parameters thereby making our method\nbetter suited for the mixture to be separated and thus practically more useful.\nWe test our framework on a neural network based algorithm and the results show\nan improved performance in terms of SDR and SAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

However many of these frameworks, based on\nVertex-centric or Edge-centric paradigms suffer from several issues, such as\npoor cache utilization, irregular memory accesses, heavy use of synchronization\nprimitives and theoretical inefficiency, that deteriorate overall performance\nand scalability.\n  Recently, we proposed a cache and memory efficient partition-centric paradigm\nfor computing PageRank. In this paper, we generalize this approach to develop a\nnovel Graph Processing Over Partitions (GPOP) framework that is\ncache-efficient, scalable and work-efficient. GPOP induces locality in memory\naccesses by increasing granularity of execution to vertex subsets called\n'partitions', thereby dramatically improving the cache performance of a variety\nof graph algorithms. It achieves high scalability by enabling completely lock\nand atomic free computation. GPOP's built-in analytical performance model\nenables it to use a hybrid of source and partitioncentric communication modes\nin a way that ensures work-efficiency each iteration, while simultaneously\nboosting high bandwidth sequential memory accesses.\n  We extensively evaluate the performance of GPOP for a variety of graph\nalgorithms, using several large datasets. We observe that GPOP incurs up to 9x,\n6.8x and 5.5x less L2 cache misses compared to Ligra, GraphMat and Galois,\nrespectively.

The greater\naccuracy of NSPs with respect to spectra from the AMBRE, GES_Grid, PHOENIX,\nC14, and B17 synthetic spectral libraries is demonstrated by evaluating the\nconsistency of the predictions of the different libraries for the UVES-U580\nsample stars.

Considering both the phases as leaky dielectric, we have\nperformed numerical simulations to study the effect of channel confinement on\nthe drop trajectories in the presence of a uniform electric field. Two\nimportant varieties of motion are identified in the present analysis, namely\n(i) the reversing motion and (ii) the passing over motion. The study suggests\nthat conversion of the passing over motion to the reversing motion or vice\nversa is possible via modulating the strength of the imposed electric field.\nSuch a conversion of the pattern of droplet migration is also possible in a\nconfined domain due to change in different electrical properties of the system.\nThe present numerical model is also able to predict the pattern of the\ntrajectory of individual droplets depending on the initial distance separating\nthe two. For example, a smaller initial distance results in a reversing motion\nwhereas a passing over motion is predicted when the distance between the\ndroplets is significantly large. However, the final positions of the droplets\nare found to be independent of their initial positions. Interestingly, presence\nof electric field is found to prevent droplet coalescence to a certain extent\ndepending on its strength, thus rendering the emulsion stable.

The current investigation successfully presents a novel\ntechnique to predict the precise positions of a system of droplets in a\nmicro-channel and how electric field can be used as a tool to modulate droplet\ntrajectories in an emulsion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 08:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

While reference textbooks have been\npublished on the topic, no tutorial at IEEE VIS has covered this area in recent\nyears, and never at a software level and from a user's point-of-view. This\ntutorial fills this gap by providing a beginner's introduction to topological\nmethods for practitioners, researchers, students, and lecturers. In particular,\ninstead of focusing on theoretical aspects and algorithmic details, this\ntutorial focuses on how topological methods can be useful in practice for\nconcrete data analysis tasks such as segmentation, feature extraction or\ntracking. The tutorial describes in detail how to achieve these tasks with TTK.\nFirst, after an introduction to topological methods and their application in\ndata analysis, a brief overview of TTK's main entry point for end users, namely\nParaView, will be presented. Second, an overview of TTK's main features will be\ngiven. A running example will be described in detail, showcasing how to access\nTTK's features via ParaView, Python, VTK/C++, and C++. Third, hands-on sessions\nwill concretely show how to use TTK in ParaView for multiple, representative\ndata analysis tasks. Fourth, the usage of TTK will be presented for developers,\nin particular by describing several examples of visualization and data analysis\nprojects that were built on top of TTK. Finally, some feedback regarding the\nusage of TTK as a teaching platform for topological analysis will be given.\nPresenters of this tutorial include experts in topological methods, core\nauthors of TTK as well as active users, coming from academia, labs, or\nindustry. A large part of the tutorial will be dedicated to hands-on exercises\nand a rich material package (including TTK pre-installs in virtual machines,\ncode, data, demos, video tutorials, etc.) will be provided to the participants.\nThis tutorial mostly targets students, practitioners and researchers who are\nnot experts in topological methods but who are interested in using them in\ntheir daily tasks. We also target researchers already familiar to topological\nmethods and who are interested in using or contributing to TTK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 09:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

In this\nchapter we discuss how to characterize the infall of material in a sample of 36\nhigh-mass accretion disk candidates covering a broad range of luminosities,\nfrom 10$^3$ $L_\\odot$ to 10$^6$ $L_\\odot$, compiled by Beltr\\'an & de Wit\n(2016) with the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 09:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

Its stochastic representation involves a skew-normal\n(SN) vector and a non negative mixing scalar variable, independent of the SN\nvector, that injects kurtosis into the SMSN model. We address the problem of\nfinding the maximal skewness projection for vectors that follow a SMSN\ndistribution; when simple conditions on the moments of the mixing variable are\nfulfilled, it can be shown that the direction yielding the maximal skewness is\nproportional to the shape vector. This finding stresses the directional nature\nof the asymmetry in this class of distributions; it also provides the\ntheoretical foundations for solving the skewness model based projection pursuit\nfor SMSN vectors.

Certain stellar atmospheres, however, show strong\ndeviations from spherical symmetry, and need to be treated in 3D. Aims: We\npresent a newly developed 3D radiative transfer code, tailored to the solution\nof the radiation field in rapidly expanding stellar atmospheres. We apply our\ncode to the continuum transfer in wind-ablation models, and to the UV resonance\nline formation in magnetic winds. Methods: We have used a 3D finite-volume\nmethod for the solution of the equation of radiative transfer, to study\ncontinuum- and line-scattering problems. Convergence has been accelerated by a\nnon-local approximate Lambda-iteration scheme. Particular emphasis has been put\non careful (spherically symmetric) test cases. Results: Typical errors of the\nsource functions, when compared to 1D solutions, are of the order of 10-20 %,\nand increase for optically thick continua. In circumstellar discs, the\nradiation temperatures in the (optically thin) transition region from wind to\ndisc are quite similar to corresponding values in the wind. For MHD simulations\nof dynamical magnetospheres, the line profiles, calculated with our 3D code,\nagree well with previous solutions using a 3D-SEI method. When compared with\nprofiles resulting from the `analytic dynamical magnetosphere' (ADM) model,\nsignificant differences become apparent. Conclusions: Due to similar radiation\ntemperatures in the wind and the transition region to the disc, the same\nline-strength distribution can be applied within radiation hydrodynamic\ncalculations for circumstellar discs in `accreting high-mass stars'. To\nproperly describe the UV line formation in dynamical magnetospheres, the ADM\nmodel needs to be further developed, at least in a large part of the outer\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 10:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

In a parameter study, we find the scaling with\nresistivity of current sheet properties at the halting time is in good\nagreement - in both geometries - with that inferred from a known 1D similarity\nsolution. We find that the halting of the implosions occurs rapidly after\nreaching the diffusion scale by sudden Ohmic heating of the dense plasma within\nthe current sheet, which provides a pressure gradient sufficient to oppose\nfurther collapse and decelerate the converging flow. This back-pressure grows\nto exceed that required for force balance and so the post-implosion evolution\nis characterised by the consequences of the current sheet `bouncing' outwards.\nThese are: (i) the launching of propagating fast MHD waves (shocks) outwards\nand (ii) the width-wise expansion of the current sheet itself.

However, PFC brings\nwith it a host of problems such as head-of-the-line blocking, congestion\nspreading, and occasional deadlocks.

From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the\nso-called `slipper' and `croissant' shapes depending on the prevailing flow\nconditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur\nat low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method,\nwe are able to find the transition point between both `phases' of stable shapes\nwhich is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical\nsimulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain\nso-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations.\nProspectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of\nmeasurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable\nresults. Moreover, the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the\ninfluence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting\nmacroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 11:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

The aim of this paper is\nto present the diverse SED characteristics of RV Tauri stars and investigate\ntheir evolutionary nature as a function of their SEDs. We carried out a\nsystematic study of RV Tauri stars in the SMC and LMC because of their known\ndistances and hence luminosities. Their SEDs were classified in three groups:\ndusty (disc-type), non-dusty (non-IR) and uncertain. A period-luminosity-\ncolour (PLC) relation was calibrated. The luminosities from the PLC were\ncomplemented with the ones found using their SEDs and the stars were placed on\nthe HR-diagram. The four main results from this study are: 1) RV Tauri stars\nwith a clear IR-excess have disc-type SEDs, which indicates that the dust is\ntrapped in a stable disc. Given the strong link between disc-type SEDs and\nbinarity in the Galaxy, we postulate that these are binaries as well. These\ncover a range of luminosities and we argue that the more luminous ones are\npost-AGB stars while the lower luminosity ones are likely post-Red Giant Branch\n(post-RGB) stars. 2) Two of these objects have variable mean brightness with\nperiods of 916 and 850 days, respectively, caused by variable extinction during\norbital motion. 3) The non-dusty RV Tauri stars and the objects with an\nuncertain SED evolve such that the circumstellar dust has dispersed. If they\nare single stars, they are post-AGB objects of low initial mass ($<$ 1.25\nM$_\\odot$), while if they are binaries, the low-luminosity part of the sample\nare likely post-RGB stars. 4) We find that RV Tauri stars with dust are on\naverage more luminous than the rest of the sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 12:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Motivated by this, we explore\nthe causal structure of black holes as perceived by scalar fields in the\nHorndeski class. We consider linearized perturbations on a fixed background\nmetric that describes a generic black hole. The effective metric that\ndetermines the propagation of these perturbations does not generally coincide\nwith the background metric (to which matter fields couple minimally). Assuming\nthat the metric and the scalar respect stationarity and that the surface\ngravity of the horizon is constant, we prove that Killing horizons of the\nbackground metric are always Killing horizons of the effective metric as well.\nHence, scalar perturbations cannot escape the region that matter fields\nperceive as the interior of the black hole. This result does not depend on\nasymptotics but only on local considerations and does not make any reference to\nno-hair theorems.

The observation of these disordered\nmagnetic states is particularly pervasive amongst a class of materials known as\nfrustrated magnets, in which the competition between various magnetic exchange\ninteractions prevents the system from adopting long-range magnetic order at low\ntemperatures. Spin liquids continue to be of great interest due to their exotic\nnature and the possibility that they may support fractionalised excitations,\nsuch as Majorana fermions.

While conventional NMR requires signals from 1e12 or\nmore nuclei, recent advances in sensitive magnetometry have dramatically\nlowered this number to a level where few or even individual nuclear spins can\nbe detected. It is natural to ask whether continuous FID detection can still be\napplied at the single spin level, or whether quantum back-action modifies or\neven suppresses the NMR response.

In this study, we use two-point auto, cross and mark correlation\nfunctions to investigate the extent to which small-scale clustering properties\nof star forming galaxies can be used to gain physical insight into\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions between galaxies of similar optical brightness and\nstellar mass. The Halpha star formers, drawn from the highly spatially complete\nGalaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, show an increase in clustering on small\nseparations. Moreover, the clustering strength shows a strong dependence on\noptical brightness and stellar mass, where (1) the clustering amplitude of\noptically brighter galaxies at a given separation is larger than that of\noptically fainter systems, (2) the small scale clustering properties (e.g. the\nstrength, the scale at which the signal relative to the fiducial power law\nplateaus) of star forming galaxies appear to differ as a function of increasing\noptical brightness of galaxies. According to cross and mark correlation\nanalyses, the former result is largely driven by the increased dust content in\noptically bright star forming galaxies. The latter could be interpreted as\nevidence of a correlation between interaction-scale and optical brightness of\ngalaxies, where physical evidence of interactions between optically bright star\nformers, likely hosted within relatively massive halos, persist over larger\nseparations than those between optically faint star formers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 14:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

We have used the\nHerschel Hi-GAL compact-clump catalogue to examine trends in evolutionary stage\nover large spatial scales in the inner Galaxy. We examine the relationship\nbetween the fraction of clumps with embedded star formation (the star-forming\nfraction, or SFF) and other measures of star-formation activity. Based on a\npositive correlation between SFF and evolutionary indicators such as the\nluminosity-to-mass ratio, we assert that the SFF principally traces the average\nevolutionary state of a sample and must depend on the local fraction of\nrapidly-evolving, high-mass young stellar objects. The spiral-arm tangent point\nlongitudes show small excesses in the SFF, though these can be accounted for by\na small number of the most massive clusters, just 7.6% of the total number of\nclumps in the catalogue. This suggests that while the arms tend to be home to\nthe Galaxy's massive clusters, the remaining 92.4% of Hi-GAL clumps in our\ncatalogue do not show an enhancement of star formation within arms. Globally,\nthe SFF is highest at the Galactic midplane and inner longitudes. We find no\nsignificant trend in evolutionary stage as a function of position across spiral\narms at the tangent-point longitudes. This indicates that the angular offset\nobserved between gas and stars, if coordinated by a density wave, is not\nevident at the clump phase; alternatively, the onset of star formation is not\ntriggered by the spiral density wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 14:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

In the Coulomb blockade regime, however, cotunneling\nprocesses dominate. Cotunneling is an inherently quantum phenomenon and thus\ngives rise to interesting observations, such as an increase in the current shot\nnoise. Since cotunneling processes are inherently fast compared to the\nsequential processes, it is of interest to examine the short time behaviour of\nsystems where cotunneling plays a role, and whether these systems display\nnonrenewal statistics. We consider three questions in this paper. Given that an\nelectron has tunneled from the source to the drain via a cotunneling or\nsequential process, what is the waiting time until another electron cotunnels\nfrom the source to the drain? What are the statistical properties of these\nwaiting time intervals? How does cotunneling affect the statistical properties\nof a system with strong inelastic electron-electron interactions? In answering\nthese questions, we extend the existing formalism for waiting time\ndistributions in single electron transport to include cotunneling processes via\nan $n$-resolved Markovian master equation. We demonstrate that for a single\nresonant level the analytic waiting time distribution including cotunneling\nprocesses yields information on individual tunneling amplitudes. For both a SRL\nand an Anderson impurity deep in the Coulomb blockade there is a nonzero\nprobability for two electrons to cotunnel to the drain with zero waiting time\ninbetween. Furthermore, we show that at high voltages cotunneling processes\nslightly modify the nonrenewal behaviour of an Anderson impurity with a strong\ninelastic electron-electron interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 07:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 17:14:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 13:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The\nfocus of this analysis is on the collaboration network between individuals,\ncaptured by their co-assignment in the delivery of particular tasks, and their\ndynamical patterns.

It is well established that the\nbulge test method, generally considered the gold standard for characterizing\nfreestanding thin films, is unsuited to characterize buckled membranes, because\nof compressive residual stresses and a negligible out-of-plane bending\nstiffness. When pressurized, buckled membranes immediately start entering the\nripple regime, but they typically plastically deform or fracture before\nreaching the cylindrical regime. In this paper the bulge test method is\nextended to enable characterization of buckled freestanding ultra-thin\nmembranes in the ripple regime. In a combined experimental-numerical approach,\nthe advanced technique of digital height correlation was first extended towards\nthe sub-micron scale, to enable measurement of the highly varying local 3D\nstrain and curvature fields on top of a single ripple in a total region of\ninterest as small as approximately 25 microns. Subsequently, a finite element\n(FE) model was set up to analyze the post-buckled membrane under pressure\nloading. In the seemingly complex ripple configuration, a suitable combination\nof local region of interest and pressure range was identified for which the\nstress-strain state can be extracted from the local strain and curvature\nfields. This enables the extraction of both the Young's modulus and Poisson's\nratio from a single bulge sample, contrary to the conventional bulge test\nmethod. Virtual experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, while\nreal proof of principle of the method was demonstrated for fragile specimens\nwith rather narrow ( approximately 25 microns) ripples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 09:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}
