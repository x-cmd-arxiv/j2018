There are various ways in which this result can\nbe non-trivially generalised. For example, one can interpret this result as\nsaying that in any graph $G$ on at least two vertices there is a set $B$ of at\nleast two vertices such that the difference between the largest and the\nsmallest degrees (in $G$) of the vertices of $B$ is zero. In this vein we make\nthe following definition. For any $B\\subset V(G)$, let the spread $sp(B)$ of\n$B$ be defined to be the difference between the largest and the smallest of the\ndegrees of the vertices in $B$. For any $k\\geq 0$, let $sp(G,k)$ be the largest\ncardinality of a set of vertices $B$ such that $sp(B)\\leq k$. Therefore the\nfirst elementary result in graph theory says that, for any graph $G$ on at\nleast two vertices, $sp(G,0)\\geq 2$.\n  In this paper we first give a proof of a result of Erd\\\" os, Chen, Rousseau\nand Schelp which generalises the above to $sp(G,k)\\geq k+2$ for any graph on at\nleast $k+2$ vertices. Our proof is short and elementary and does not use the\nfamous Erd\\\" os-Gallai Theorem on vertex degrees. We then develop lower bounds\nfor $sp(G,k)$ in terms of the order of $G$ and its minimum, maximum and average\ndegree. We then use these results to give lower bounds on $sp(G,k)$ for trees\nand maximal outerplanar graphs, most of which we show to be sharp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

The theory includes the hitherto overlooked\ncapacitive effects due to the finite spatial extension of a surface. The basic\nstructure of this theory is independent of the particulars of electron\ndynamics. Analytical expressions have been obtained of the charge\ndensity-density response function, which is naturally parsed into two parts.\nOne of them represents a bulk property while the other a pure surface property.\nWe apply the theory to study the responses according to several electronic\ndynamics models and provide a unified view of their validity and limitations.\nThe models studied include the local dielectric model (DM), the dispersive\nhydrodynamic model (HDM) and specular reflection model (SRM), as well as the\nless common semi-classical model (SCM) based on Boltzmann's transport equation.\nWe show that, in terms of their basic equations, the SRM is an extension of the\nHDM, just as the HDM is an extension of the DM. The SCM improves over the SRM\ncritically through the inclusion of translation symmetry breaking and surface\nroughness effects. We then employ the response function to evaluate the\nso-called dynamical structure factor, which plays an important role in particle\nscattering. As expected, this factor reveals a peak due to the excitation of\nsurface plasma waves (SPWs). Surprisingly, however, the peak is shown to be\nconsiderably sharper in the SCM than in other models, indicating an incipient\ninstability of the system according to this model. We also study the\ndistribution of charges induced by a charged particle grazing over a SIM\nsurface at constant speed.

One such\napproach is to use hybrid algorithms, where problems are reduced to a\nparameterized quantum circuit that is often optimized in a classical feedback\nloop. Here we describe one such hybrid algorithm for machine learning tasks by\nbuilding upon the classical algorithm known as random kitchen sinks. Our\ntechnique, called quantum kitchen sinks, uses quantum circuits to nonlinearly\ntransform classical inputs into features that can then be used in a number of\nmachine learning algorithms.

Here, we\nreport evidence of this transition via changes in the BL structure of vertical\nnatural convection (VC), which is a buoyancy driven flow between differentially\nheated vertical walls. The dataset spans $Ra$-values from $10^5$ to $10^9$ and\nPrandtl number value of 0.709. For this $Ra$ range, the VC flow exhibits\nclassical state behaviour in a global sense. Yet, with increasing $Ra$, we\nobserve that near-wall higher-shear patches occupy increasingly larger\nfractions of the wall-areas, which suggest that the BLs are undergoing a\ntransition from the classical state to the ultimate shear-dominated state. The\npresence of streaky structures-reminiscent of the near-wall streaks in\ncanonical wall-bounded turbulence-further supports the notion of this\ntransition. Within the higher-shear patches, conditionally averaged statistics\nyield a log-variation in the local mean temperature profiles, in agreement with\nthe log-law of the wall for mean temperature, and a $Ra^{0.37}$ effective\npower-law scaling of the local Nusselt number, consistent with the\nlogarithmically corrected 1/2-power law scaling predicted for ultimate thermal\nconvection for very large $Ra$.

However, no metamagnetic\ntransition is observed in Cu0.98Mn0.96As, indicating that the magnetic\ninteractions in this system are very sensitive to Cu vacancies and Cu/Mn site\nmixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 17:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

In this study, we consider a flow that is similar to RBC but with the\ndirection of temperature gradient perpendicular to gravity instead of parallel;\nwe refer to this configuration as vertical natural convection (VC). Since the\ndirection of the temperature gradient is different in VC, there is no exact\nrelation for the average kinetic dissipation rate, which makes it necessary to\nexplore alternative definitions for $Nu$, $Re$ and $Ra$ and to find physical\narguments for closure, rather than making use of the exact relation between\n$Nu$ and the dissipation rates as in RBC. Once we remove the walls from VC to\nobtain the homogeneous setup, we find that the aforementioned $1/2$-power-law\nscaling is present, similar to the case of homogeneous RBC. When focussing on\nthe bulk, we find that the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers in the bulk of VC too\nexhibit the $1/2$-power-law scaling. These results suggest that the\n$1/2$-power-law scaling may even be found at lower Rayleigh numbers if the\nappropriate quantities in the turbulent bulk flow are employed for the\ndefinitions of $Ra$, $Re$ and $Nu$. From a stability perspective, at low- to\nmoderate-$Ra$, we find that the time-evolution of the Nusselt number for\nhomogenous vertical natural convection is unsteady, which is consistent with\nthe nature of the elevator modes reported in previous studies on homogeneous\nRBC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 17:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

Model sizes\ncan be reduced by a factor of 4 by quantizing weights to 8-bits, even when\n8-bit arithmetic is not supported. This can be achieved with simple, post\ntraining quantization of weights.We benchmark latencies of quantized networks\non CPUs and DSPs and observe a speedup of 2x-3x for quantized implementations\ncompared to floating point on CPUs. Speedups of up to 10x are observed on\nspecialized processors with fixed point SIMD capabilities, like the Qualcomm\nQDSPs with HVX.\n  Quantization-aware training can provide further improvements, reducing the\ngap to floating point to 1% at 8-bit precision.

We use\nan updated model for the evolution of masses and spins of supermassive black\nholes (SMBHs), coupled to the latest version of the semi-analytical model of\ngalaxy formation GALFORM using the Planck cosmology and a high resolution\nMillennium style dark matter simulation to make predictions for AGN and SMBH\nproperties for $0 < z < 6$. We compare the model to the observed black hole\nmass function and the SMBH versus galaxy bulge mass relation at $z=0$, and\ncompare the predicted bolometric, hard X-ray, soft X-ray and optical AGN\nluminosity functions to observations at $z < 6$, and find that the model is in\ngood agreement with the observations. The model predicts that at $z<2$ and\n$L_{\\mathrm{bol}} < 10^{43} \\mathrm{ergs^{-1}}$, the AGN luminosity function is\ndominated by objects accreting in an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF)\ndisc state, while at higher redshifts and higher luminosities the dominant\ncontribution is from objects accreting via a thin disc or at super-Eddington\nrates. The model also predicts that the AGN luminosity function at $z<3$ and\n$L_{\\mathrm{bol}} < 10^{44} \\mathrm{ergs^{-1}}$ is dominated by the\ncontribution from AGN fuelled by quiescent hot halo accretion, while at higher\nluminosities and higher redshifts, the AGN luminosity function is dominated by\nthe contribution from AGN fuelled by starbursts triggered by disc\ninstabilities. We employ this model to predict the evolution of SMBH masses,\nEddington ratios, and spins, finding that the median SMBH spin evolves very\nlittle for $0<z<6$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 18:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

We show that the inclusion of radiation trapping leads to an\nenhanced forbidden region, such that even Compton-thick material can\npotentially be disrupted by sub-Eddington luminosities. We compare our model\nresults to the most complete sample of local AGNs with measured X-ray\nproperties, and find good agreement. Considering the anisotropic emission from\nthe accretion disc, we also expect the development of dusty outflows along the\npolar axis, which may naturally account for the polar dust emission recently\ndetected in several AGNs from mid-infrared observations. Radiative feedback\nthus appears to be the key mechanism regulating the obscuration properties of\nAGNs, and we discuss its physical implications in the context of co-evolution\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 18:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Leveraging on their bodies elasticity, soft robots\npromise to push their limits far beyond the barriers that affect their rigid\ncounterparts. However, existing control strategies aiming at achieving this\ngoal are either tailored on specific examples, or rely on model cancellations -\nthus defeating the purpose of introducing elasticity in the first place.\n  In a series of recent works, we proposed to implement efficient oscillatory\nmotions in robots subject to a potential field, aimed at solving these issues.\nA main component of this theory are Eigenmanifolds, that we defined as\nnonlinear continuations of the classic linear eigenspaces. When the soft robot\nis initialized on one of these manifolds, it evolves autonomously while\npresenting regular - and thus practically useful - evolutions, called normal\nmodes. In addition to that, we proposed a control strategy making modal\nmanifolds attractors for the system, and acting on the total energy of the soft\nrobot to move from a modal evolution to the other. In this way, a large class\nof autonomous behaviors can be excited, which are direct expression of the\nembodied intelligence of the soft robot.\n  Despite the fact that the idea behind our work comes from physical intuition\nand preliminary experimental validations, the formulation that we have provided\nso far is however rather theoretical, and very much in need of an experimental\nvalidation. The aim of this paper is to provide such an experimental validation\nusing as testbed the articulated soft leg. We will introduce a simplified\ncontrol strategy, and we will test its effectiveness on this system, to\nimplement swing-like oscillations.

A theoretical solution to\nthis paradox locates the missing baryons in the hot and tenuous filamentary gas\nbetween galaxies, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium. However, it is\ndifficult to detect them there because the largest by far constituent of this\ngas - hydrogen - is mostly ionized and therefore almost invisible in\nfar-ultraviolet spectra with typical signal-to-noise ratios. Indeed, despite\nthe large observational efforts, only a few marginal claims of detection have\nbeen made so far. Here we report observations of two absorbers of highly\nionized oxygen (OVII) in the high signal-to-noise-ratio X-ray spectrum of a\nquasar at redshift >0.4. These absorbers show no variability over a 2-year\ntimescale and have no associated cold absorption, making the assumption that\nthey originate from the quasar's intrinsic outflow or the host galaxy's\ninterstellar medium implausible. The OVII systems lie in regions characterized\nby large (x4 compared to average) galaxy over-densities and their number (down\nto the sensitivity threshold of our data), agrees well with numerical\nsimulation predictions for the long-sought warm-hot intergalactic medium\n(WHIM).

Serializability is a\nwell-understood correctness criterion for transactional programs; understanding\nwhether applications are serializable when executed in a weakly-consistent\nenvironment, however remains a challenging exercise. In this work, we combine\nthe dependency graph-based characterization of serializability and the\nframework of abstract executions to develop a fully automated approach for\nstatically finding bounded serializability violations under \\emph{any} weak\nconsistency model. We reduce the problem of serializability to satisfiability\nof a formula in First-Order Logic, which allows us to harness the power of\nexisting SMT solvers. We provide rules to automatically construct the FOL\nencoding from programs written in SQL (allowing loops and conditionals) and the\nconsistency specification written as a formula in FOL. In addition to detecting\nbounded serializability violations, we also provide two orthogonal schemes to\nreason about unbounded executions by providing sufficient conditions (in the\nform of FOL formulae) whose satisfiability would imply the absence of anomalies\nin any arbitrary execution. We have applied the proposed technique on TPC-C, a\nreal world database program with complex application logic, and were able to\ndiscover anomalies under Parallel Snapshot Isolation, and verify\nserializability for unbounded executions under Snapshot Isolation, two\nconsistency mechanisms substantially weaker than serializability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 20:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

In this\npaper, we characterize the dependencies of popular webservices on third party\nservices and how these can lead to DoS, RoQ attacks, and reduction in security\nposture. In particular, we focus on three critical infrastructure services:\nDNS, CDNs, and certificate authorities (CAs). We analyze both direct\nrelationships (e.g., Twitter uses Dyn) and indirect dependencies (e.g., Netflix\nuses Symantec as OCSP and Symantec, in turn, uses Verisign for DNS). Our key\nfindings are: (1) 73.14% of the top 100,000 popular services are vulnerable to\nreduction in availabil- ity due to potential attacks on third-party DNS, CDN,\nCA services that they exclusively rely on; (2) the use of third-party services\nis concentrated, so that if the top-10 providers of CDN, DNS and OCSP services\ngo down, they can potentially impact 25%-46% of the top 100K most popular web\nservices; (3) transitive depen- dencies significantly increase the set of\nwebservices that exclusively depend on popular CDN and DNS service providers,\nin some cases by ten times (4) targeting even less popular webservices can\npotentially cause signifi- cant collateral damage, affecting upto 20% of the\ntop- 100K webservices due to their shared dependencies.

The Thick Target Inverse\nKinematics (TTIK) technique can be used to study the breakup of excited\nself-conjugate nuclei into many alpha particles.

There is a common need to analyze the data from flow\nmeasurements or high-fidelity computations for stability characteristics,\nidentification of coherent structures and develop evolutionary models for\nreal-time data-driven control. Given that sparse reconstruction is inherently\nan ill-posed problem, the most successful approaches require the knowledge of\nthe underlying basis space spanning the manifold in which the system resides.\nIn this study, we employ an approach that learns basis from singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) of training data to reconstruct sparsely sensed information\nat randomly sampled locations. This allows us to leverage energy sparsity with\nl2 minimization instead of the more expensive, sparsity promoting l1\nminimization. Further, for unknown flow systems where only global operating\nparameters such as Reynolds (Re) number and raw data are available, it is often\nnot clear what the optimal number of sensors and their placement for near-exact\nreconstruction needs to be.

As such, there has been\nsignificant recent interest in computer aided diagnosis systems for analysing\nhistopathological slides for cancer grading to aid pathologists to perform\ncancer diagnosis and grading in a more efficient, accurate, and consistent\nmanner. In this work, we investigate and explore a deep triple-stream residual\nnetwork (TriResNet) architecture for the purpose of tile-level histopathology\ngrading, which is the critical first step to computer-aided whole-slide\nhistopathology grading. In particular, the design mentality behind the proposed\nTriResNet network architecture is to facilitate for the learning of a more\ndiverse set of quantitative features to better characterize the complex tissue\ncharacteristics found in histopathology samples. Experimental results on two\nwidely-used computer-aided histopathology benchmark datasets (CAMELYON16\ndataset and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) dataset) demonstrated that the\nproposed TriResNet network architecture was able to achieve noticeably improved\naccuracies when compared with two other state-of-the-art deep convolutional\nneural network architectures.

However, the\napplication of hard labels may lose some information about the tendency of\nclass distributions. Instead, we propose a Centroid distance-based Soft coding\nscheme to indicate such tendency, named as CSECOC. In our algorithm, Sequential\nForward Floating Selection (SFFS) is applied to search an optimal class\nassignment by minimizing the ratio of intra-group and inter-group distance. In\nthis way, a hard coding matrix is generated initially. Then we propose a\nmeasure, named as coverage, to describe the probability of a sample in a class\nfalling to a correct group. The coverage of a class a group replace the\ncorresponding hard element, so as to form a soft coding matrix.

Instead of classifiers, regressors are used as\nbase learners in this algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first\ntime that soft coding scheme has been proposed.

For a robot\nattempting to learn to perform a sequential task with critical subgoal states,\nsuch states can provide a natural opportunity for interaction with a human\nexpert. This paper analyzes the benefit of incorporating a notion of subgoals\ninto Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) with a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)\nframework. The learning process is interactive, with a human expert first\nproviding input in the form of full demonstrations along with some subgoal\nstates. These subgoal states define a set of subtasks for the learning agent to\ncomplete in order to achieve the final goal. The learning agent queries for\npartial demonstrations corresponding to each subtask as needed when the agent\nstruggles with the subtask. The proposed Human Interactive IRL (HI-IRL)\nframework is evaluated on several discrete path-planning tasks.

Each semigroup structure among these leads to a family of\ndensely defined linear operators $W^{b}_{\\lambda_u}$ acting on $\\ell^2(V),$\nwhich we refer to as weighted join operators at a given base point $b \\in\nV_{\\infty}$ with prescribed vertex $u \\in V$.

In this paper, we systematically study\nthese operators. We also present a more involved counter-part of weighted join\noperators on rootless directed trees. In both cases, the class of weighted join\noperators overlaps with the well-studied classes of complex Jordan operators\nand $n$-symmetric operators. An important half of this paper is devoted to the\nstudy of rank one extensions $W_{f, g}$ of weighted join operators, where $f\n\\in \\ell^2(V)$ and $g : V \\to \\mathbb C$ is unspecified.

Here, the image re-sampling not\nonly refers to image full-resolution re-sampling but also low-resolution\nre-sampling. We generalize this method for standard-compliant image compression\n(SCIC) framework and deep neural networks based compression (DNNC) framework.\nSpecifically, an input image is measured by re-sampling network (RSN) network\nto get re-sampled vectors. Then, these vectors are directly quantized in the\nfeature space in SCIC, or discrete cosine transform coefficients of these\nvectors are quantized to further improve coding efficiency in DNNC. At the\nencoder, the quantized vectors or coefficients are losslessly compressed by\narithmetic coding. At the receiver, the decoded vectors are utilized to restore\ninput image by image decoder network (IDN). In order to train RSN network and\nIDN network together in an end-to-end fashion, our VCN network intimates\nprojection from the re-sampled vectors to the IDN-decoded image. As a result,\ngradients from IDN network to RSN network can be approximated by VCN network's\ngradient. Because dimension reduction can be further achieved by quantization\nin some dimensional space after image re-sampling within auto-encoder\narchitecture, we can well initialize our networks from pre-trained auto-encoder\nnetworks.

Although the statistical significance of the anomalies remains only at\nthe $\\sim2-3\\sigma$ significance level, the fact that there are many different\nanomalies, several of which support a possible deviation from statistical\nisotropy, has motivated a search for models that provide a common mechanism to\ngenerate them. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether these anomalies\ncould originate from non-Gaussian cosmological models, and to determine what\nproperties these models should have. We present a simple isotropic,\nnon-Gaussian class of toy models that can reproduce six of the most extensively\nstudied anomalies. We compare the presence of anomalies found in simulated maps\ngenerated from the toy models and from a standard model with Gaussian\nfluctuations. We show that the following anomalies, as found in the Planck\ndata, commonly occur in the toy model maps: (1) large-scale hemispherical\nasymmetry (large-scale dipolar modulation), (2) small-scale hemispherical\nasymmetry (alignment of the spatial distribution of CMB power over all scales\n$\\ell=[2,1500]$) , (3) a strongly non-Gaussian hot or cold spot, (4) a low\npower spectrum amplitude for $\\ell<30$, including specifically (5) a low\nquadrupole and an unusual alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole,\nand (6) parity asymmetry of the lowest multipoles.

We develop an exact algorithm that is\neffective for solving instances with many vehicles and few customers per route.\nIn our experiments, we show that in these instances solving the stochastic\nproblem is most relevant (i.e., the potential gains over the deterministic\nequivalent solution are highest). The proposed branch-price-and-cut algorithm\nrelies on an efficient labeling procedure, exact and heuristic dominance rules,\nand completion bounds to price profitable columns. Instances with up to 76\nnodes could be solved in less than 5 hours, and instances with up to 148 nodes\ncould be solved in long-runs of the algorithm. The experiments also allowed new\nfindings on the problem. Solving the stochastic problem leads to solutions up\nto 10% superior to the deterministic equivalent solution. When the number of\nroutes is not fixed, the optimal solutions under detour-to-depot and optimal\nrestocking are nearly equivalent. Opening new routes is a good strategy to\nreduce restocking costs, and in many cases results in solutions with less\ntransportation costs.

In response to this situation, we revisit the decaying\ndark matter solution to the issues, discussing possible signatures to\ndiscriminate decaying dark matter from astrophysical processes as a solution to\nsmall-scale issues. We consider an axinolike particle (ALPino) decaying into an\naxionlike particle (ALP) and gravitino with the lifetime around the age of the\nUniverse. The ALPino mass is sub-PeV and slightly ($\\Delta m/m\\sim 10^{-4}$)\nlarger than the gravitino mass, and thus the dark matter abundance does not\nalter virtually after the ALPino decays. On the other hand, the gravitino\nproduced from the ALPino decay obtains a kick velocity of $\\sim 30 \\,{\\rm km /\ns}$, which is sufficiently larger than a circular velocity of dwarf galaxies to\nimpact their dark matter distributions. The Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest constraints\nare relieved since only a small fraction ($\\sim10$%) of dark matter experiences\nthe decay at that time. Decaying dark matter is thus promoted to a viable\nsolution to small-scale issues. The ALPino relic abundance is determined\npredominantly by the decay of the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle.\nThe monochromatic ALP emission from the ALPino decay is converted to $\\sim 50\n\\,{\\rm GeV}$ photon under the Galactic magnetic field. The morphology of the\ngamma-ray flux shows a distinctive feature of the model when compared to\ndecaying dark matter that directly decays into photons.

Walking pattern generation is a fundamental topic\nin the design of these robots. The usual approach with most exoskeletons is to\nuse a pre-recorded pattern as a look-up table. There are some deficiencies with\nthis method, including data storage limitation and poor regulation relating to\nthe walking parameters. Therefore modeling human walking patterns to use in\nexoskeletons is required. The few existing models provide piece by piece\nwalking patterns, only generating at the beginning of each stride cycle in\nrespect to fixed walking parameters. In this paper, we present a real-time\nwalking pattern generation method which enables changing the walking parameters\nduring the stride. For this purpose, two feedback controlled third order\nsystems are proposed as optimal trajectory planners for generating the\ntrajectory of the x and y components of each joints position. The boundary\nconditions of the trajectories are obtained according to some pre-considered\nwalking constraints. In addition, a cost function is intended for each\ntrajectory planner in order to increase the trajectories smoothness. We use the\nminimum principle of Pontryagin to design the feedback controller in order to\ntrack the boundary conditions in such a way that the cost functions are\nminimized. Finally, by using inverse kinematics equations, the proper joints\nangles are generated for and implemented on Exoped robot. The good performance\nof the gait planner is demonstrated by second derivative continuity of the\ntrajectories being maintained as a result of a simulation, and user\nsatisfaction being determined by experimental testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 09:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

In this work, we report on\nthe calibration procedures adopted to calculate the residual differential stray\nforce per unit mass acting on the two test-masses in their nominal positions.\nThe physical parameters of the adopted dynamical model are presented, together\nwith their role on LPF performance. The analysis and results of these\nexperiments show that the dynamics of the system was accurately modeled and the\ndynamical parameters were stationary throughout the mission. Finally, the\nimpact and importance of calibrating system dynamics for future space-based\ngravitational wave observatories is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 10:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

These models are defined with equidistant\ndistant time steps. However, telemetry data from marine animals are observed\nirregularly. To account for irregular data, a time-irregularised\nfirst-difference correlated random walk model with drift is introduced. The\nmodel generalizes the commonly used first-difference correlated random walk\nwith regular time steps by allowing irregular time steps, including a drift\nterm, and by allowing different autocorrelation in the two coordinates. The\nmodel is applied to data from a ringed seal collected through the Argos\nsatellite system, and is compared to related movement models through\nsimulations. Accounting for irregular data in the movement model results in\naccurate parameter estimates and reconstruction of movement paths. Measured by\ndistance, the introduced model can provide more accurate movement paths than\nthe regular time counterpart. Extracting accurate movement paths from uncertain\ntelemetry data is important for evaluating space use patterns for marine\nanimals, which in turn is crucial for management. Further, handling irregular\ndata directly in the movement model allows efficient simultaneous analysis of\nseveral animals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 10:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

Unlike the Sachs equations, this formulation makes it\nstraightforward to find such scalars beyond the first conjugate point of a\ncongruence, where neighbouring rays cross, and the scalars diverge. We discuss\ndifferential precession across the beam which leads to a modified phase in the\ngeometrical-optics expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 12:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

As a proof-of-concept\nof the new method, we apply the modified form of the gap equation to the\nlong-pending problem about the inclusion of the Gorkov-Melik-Barkhudarov\ncorrection across the whole BCS-BEC crossover, from the BCS limit of strongly\noverlapping Cooper pairs to the BEC limit of dilute composite bosons, and for\nall temperatures in the superfluid phase. Our numerical calculations yield\nexcellent agreement with the recently determined experimental values of the gap\nparameter for an ultra-cold Fermi gas in the intermediate regime between BCS\nand BEC, as well as with the available quantum Monte Carlo data in the same\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 12:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

While well-ordered specimen are metallic, increasing amounts\nof disorder can eventually lead to an insulating state with vanishing\nconductivity in the 0K limit, but a similar number of charge carriers. These\nobservations make disordered GST one of the most promising candidates for the\nrealization of a true Anderson insulator. While so far the low-temperature\nproperties have mostly been studied in films of small grain size, here a\nsputter-deposition process is employed that enables preparation of a large\nvariety of these GST states including metallic and truly insulating ones. By\ngrowing films of GST on mica substrates, biaxially textured samples with huge\ngrain sizes are obtained. A series of these samples is employed for transport\nmeasurements, as their electron mean free path can be altered by a factor of\n20. Yet, the mean free path always remains more than an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the lateral grain size. This proves unequivocally that grain\nboundaries play a negligible role for electron scattering, while intragrain\nscattering, presumably by disordered vacancies, dominates. Most importantly,\nthese findings underline that the Anderson insulating state as well as the\nsystem's evolution towards metallic conductivity are indeed intrinsic\nproperties of the material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 12:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The\nongoing design of the ITER Radial Neutron Camera (RNC) diagnostic is composed\nby 26 lines of sight (LOS) for complete plasma inspection. The CDAcq system\naims at meeting the ITER requirements of delivering the measurement of the\nreal-time neutron emissivity profile with time resolution and control cycle\ntime of 10 ms at peak event rate of 2 MEvents/s per LOS. This measurement\ndemands the generation of the neutron spectra for each LOS with neutron/gamma\ndiscrimination and pile up rejection. The neutron spectra can be totally\nprocessed in the host CPU or it can use the processed data coming from the\nsystem FPGA. The number of neutron counts extracted from the spectra is then\nused to calculate the neutron emissivity profile using an inversion algorithm.\nMoreover, it is required that the event based raw data acquired is made\navailable to the ITER data network without local data storage for post\nprocessing. The data production for the 2 MEvents/s rate can go up to a maximum\ndata throughput of 0.5 GB/s per channel. The evaluation of the use of real-time\ndata compression techniques in RNC is also depicted in another contribution.\n  To meet the demands of the project a CDAcq prototype has been used to design\nand test a high-performance distributed software architecture taking advantage\nof multi-core CPU technology capable of coping with the requirements.

Here we revisit their idea but now in the more\naccessible framework of density functional theory of rigid particles. Our work\nrecovers their main results for rod-like particles, in that generically an\nordered assembly of non-interacting rods has three independent elastic\nconstants associated to it that all scale as the square of the length of the\nparticles and obey the inequalities $K_2 < K_1 < K_3$. We also consider the\ncase of disc-like particles, and then find in line with expectations that $K_3\n< K_1 < K_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 14:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

This modelling formalism is mostly used for checking whether the\nbehaviours of a system satisfy a set of properties of interest. Even if\nefficient model-checkers for Timed Automata exist, these tools are not easily\nconfigurable. First, they are not designed to easily allow adding new Timed\nAutomata constructs, such as new synchronization mechanisms or communication\nprocedures, but they assume a fixed set of Timed Automata constructs. Second,\nthey usually do not support the full Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and\nrely on a precise semantics for the logic in which the property of interest is\nspecified which cannot be easily modified and customized. Finally, they do not\neasily allow using different solvers that may speed up verification in\ndifferent contexts. This paper presents a novel technique to perform model\nchecking of full Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) properties on TA. The\ntechnique relies on the translation of both the TA and the MITL formula into an\nintermediate Constraint LTL over clocks (CLTLoc) formula which is verified\nthrough an available decision procedure. The technique is flexible since the\nintermediate logic allows the encoding of new semantics as well as new TA\nconstructs, by just adding new CLTLoc formulae. Furthermore, our technique is\nnot bound to a specific solver as the intermediate CLTLoc formula can be\nverified using different procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 14:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 10:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

The estimate of the\nspherically averaged power spectrum in the window, however, differs from the\ntrue value because of the line of sight anisotropies in the signal.

To examine\nproperties of a given correlation matrix, a common practice is to compare the\nsame quantity between the original correlation matrix and reference correlation\nmatrices, such as those derived from random matrix theory, that partially\npreserve properties of the original matrix. We propose a model to generate such\nreference correlation and covariance matrices for the given matrix. Correlation\nmatrices are often analysed as networks, which are heterogeneous across nodes\nin terms of the total connectivity to other nodes for each node. Given this\nbackground, the present algorithm generates random networks that preserve the\nexpectation of total connectivity of each node to other nodes, akin to\nconfiguration models for conventional networks. Our algorithm is derived from\nthe maximum entropy principle.

Using two independent models, a\nsimplified lumped capacity model and a detailed three-dimensional CFD-CHT\nsimulation, an efficient, two-stage calculation method is suggested for an\noptimized determination of control strategies and their parameters. This\ncomplements existing published works which usually control more than one\nparameter, but use one model.

This approach, along with\nTOF information, can be of high interest in clinical Positron emission\ntomography (PET) applications where a typical ring configuration is used.

The physical mechanisms of interest can be grouped\ninto two classes: passive and active. The main passive effect is the fast force\nrecovery which does not require the detachment of myosin cross-bridges from\nactin filaments and can operate without a specialized supply ATP. In mechanical\nterms, it can be viewed as a collective folding-unfolding phenomenon in the\nsystem of interacting bistable units and modeled by near equilibrium Langevin\ndynamics. The parallel active force generation mechanism operates at slow\ntimescales, requires detachment and is crucially dependent on ATP hydrolysis.\nThe underlying mechanical processes take place far from equilibrium and are\nrepresented by stochastic models with broken time reversal symmetry implying\nnon-potentiality, correlated noise or multiple reservoirs. The modeling\napproaches reviewed in this paper deal with both active and passive processes\nand support from the mechanical perspective the biological point of view that\nphenomena involved in slow (active) and fast (passive) force generation are\ntightly intertwined. They reveal, however, that biochemical studies in\nsolution, macroscopic physiological measurements and structural analysis do not\nprovide by themselves all the necessary insights into the functioning of the\ncontractile system. In particular, the reviewed body of work emphasizes the\nimportant role of long-range interactions and criticality in securing the\ntargeted mechanical response in the physiological regime of isometric\ncontractions. The importance of the purely mechanical microscale modeling is\naccentuated at the end of the paper where we address the puzzling issue of the\nstability of muscle response on the so called descending limb of the isometric\ntetanus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 09:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Therefore, we provide an extension of the modeling\nequations that allows for a more reliable determination of the electromagnetic\nfield during the evolution process.
