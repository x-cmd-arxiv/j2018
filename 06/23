We found\nthat a perpendicular magnetic field can separate the wavefunctions of the\ncounter-propagating kink states into opposite directions. Specifically, the\nseparation vanishes at the charge neutrality point. The separation increases as\nthe Fermi level deviates from the charge neutrality point and can reach a\nmagnitude comparable to the wavefunction spread at a moderate field strength.\nSuch spatial separation of oppositely propagating ZLMs effectively suppresses\nbackscattering. Moreover, the presence of a magnetic field enlarges the bulk\ngap and suppresses the bound states, thereby further reducing the scattering.\nThese mechanisms effectively increase the mean free paths of the ZLMs to\napproximately 1 micron in the presence of a disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 16:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is one of the most popular RNN units\nin deep learning applications. LSTM transforms the input and the previous\nhidden states to the next states with the affine transformation, multiplication\noperations and a nonlinear activation function, which makes a good data\nrepresentation for a given task. The affine transformation includes rotation\nand reflection, which change the semantic or syntactic information of\ndimensions in the hidden states. However, considering that a model interprets\nthe output sequence of LSTM over the whole input sequence, the dimensions of\nthe states need to keep the same type of semantic or syntactic information\nregardless of the location in the sequence. In this paper, we propose a simple\nvariant of the LSTM unit, persistent recurrent unit (PRU), where each dimension\nof hidden states keeps persistent information across time, so that the space\nkeeps the same meaning over the whole sequence. In addition, to improve the\nnonlinear transformation power, we add a feedforward layer in the PRU\nstructure. In the experiment, we evaluate our proposed methods with three\ndifferent tasks, and the results confirm that our methods have better\nperformance than the conventional LSTM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 16:19:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 07:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

Nonetheless, one may expect sequences of bits generated by\nQRNGs to have properties that pseudo-random sequences do not; indeed,\npseudo-random sequences are necessarily computable, a highly nontypical\nproperty of sequences.\n  In this paper, we discuss the differences between QRNGs and PRNGs and the\nchallenges involved in certifying the quality of QRNGs theoretically and\ntesting their output experimentally. While QRNGs are often tested with standard\nsuites of statistical tests, such tests are designed for PRNGs and only verify\nstatistical properties of a QRNG, but are insensitive to many supposed\nadvantages of QRNGs. We discuss the ability to test the incomputability and\nalgorithmic complexity of QRNGs. While such properties cannot be directly\nverified with certainty, we show how one can construct indirect tests that may\nprovide evidence for the incomputability of QRNGs. We use these tests to\ncompare various PRNGs to a QRNG, based on superconducting transmon qutrits and\ncertified by the Kochen-Specker Theorem, to see whether such evidence can be\nfound in practice.\n  While our tests fail to observe a strong advantage of the quantum random\nsequences due to algorithmic properties, the results are nonetheless\ninformative: some of the test results are ambiguous and require further study,\nwhile others highlight difficulties that can guide the development of future\ntests of algorithmic randomness and incomputability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 16:44:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

Meanwhile, the\ncross-section of inelastic processes in which the quantum state of the nucleus\nis changed, essentially has a linear dependence on the number of nucleons.\nThese two classes of processes are referred to as coherent and incoherent,\nrespectively.

As an illustration of the importance of\nthe incoherent channel we considered three experimental setups with different\nnuclei. Experiments attempting to measure coherent neutrino scattering by\nsolely detecting the recoiling nucleus, as is typical, might be including an\nincoherent background that is indistinguishable from the signal if the\nexcitation gamma eludes its detection.

Although wireless channel characteristics and\ndynamics have been extensively studied, it is important to revisit these\nconcepts in the context of the strict demands of low latency and\nultra-reliability. In this paper, we bring a modeling approach from robust\ncontrol to wireless communication -- the wireless channel characteristics are\ngiven a nominal model around which we allow for some quantified uncertainty. We\npropose certain key \"directions\" along which to bound model uncertainty that\nare relevant to URLLC. For the nominal model, we take an in-depth look at\nwireless channel characteristics such as spatial and temporal correlations\nbased on Jakes' model. Contrary to what has been claimed in the literature, we\nfind that standard Rayleigh fading processes are not bandlimited. This has\nsignificant implications on the predictability of channels. We also find that\nunder reasonable conditions the spatial correlation of channels provide a\nfading distribution that is not too far off from an independent spatial fading\nmodel. Additionally, we look at the impact of these channel models on\ncooperative communication based systems. We find that while\nspatial-diversity-based techniques are necessary to combat the adverse effects\nof fading, time-diversity-based techniques are necessary to be robust against\nunmodeled errors. Robust URLLC systems need to operate with both an SNR margin\nand a time/repetition margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 17:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-25"}

Conventional formulations lead to a Hilbert\nspace largely spanned by unphysical states; given the current inability to\nperform large scale quantum computations, we examine here how one might\nrestrict wave function evolution entirely or mostly to the physical subspace.\nWe consider such constructions for the simplest of these theories containing\ndynamical gauge bosons -- U(1) lattice gauge theory without matter in $d=2,3$\nspatial dimensions -- and find that electric-magnetic duality naturally plays\nan important role. We conclude that this approach is likely to significantly\nreduce computational overhead in $d=2$ by a reduction of variables and by\nallowing one to regulate magnetic fluctuations instead of electric. The former\nadvantage does not exist in $d=3$, but the latter might be important for\nasymptotically-free gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 07:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Our proof-of-principle findings indicate that the proposed system can\ndecrease the 2.76 X-ray images required per desired view down to zero,\nsuggesting substantial reductions of radiation dose during C-arm repositioning.\nThe proposed AR solution is a first step towards facilitating communication\nbetween the surgeon and the surgical staff, improving the quality of surgical\nimage acquisition, and enabling context-aware guidance for surgery rooms of the\nfuture. The concept of technician-in-the-loop design will become relevant to\nvarious interventions considering the expected advancements of sensing and\nwearable computing in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 18:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

In\nthis context, this two-part work puts forth the idea of engaging power\nelectronics to probe an electric grid and record its voltage response at\nactuated and metered buses, to infer non-metered loads.

In order to protect from the radiation damage, the I2C slave is\nimplemented with triple modular redundancy. Each channel of LOCld65 is tested\nto operate up to 14 Gbps with typical power dissipations (the VCSEL included)\nof 68.3 mW/channel and 62.1 mW/channel at the VCSEL voltages of 3.3 V and 2.5\nV, respectively. LOCld65 survives 4.9 kGy(SiO2). LOCld65 is an excellent match\nfor the serializer-deserializer ASIC lpGBT in single- or dual-channel optical\ntransmitters in HL-LHC upgrade applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 20:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Hill\nstability is widely used in the study of extra solar planets dynamics. However\npeople often use the coplanar and circular orbits approximation.\n  In this paper, we explain how the Hill stability can be understood in the\nframework of Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD). In the secular approximation, the\nAMD allows to discriminate between a priori stable systems and systems for\nwhich a more in depth dynamical analysis is required. We show that the general\nHill stability criterion can be expressed as a function of only the semi major\naxes, the masses and the total AMD of the system. The proposed criterion is\nonly expanded in the planets-to-star mass ratio $\\epsilon$ and not in the\nsemi-major axis ratio, in eccentricities nor in the mutual inclination.\nMoreover the expansion in $\\epsilon$ remains excellent up to values of about\n$10^{-3}$ even for two planets with very different mass values.\n  We performed numerical simulations in order to highlight the sharp change of\nbehaviour between Hill stable and Hill unstable systems. We show that Hill\nstable systems tend to be very regular whereas Hill unstable ones often lead to\nrapid planet collisions. We also remind that Hill stability does not protect\nfrom the ejection of the outer planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 22:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

A micro-mixer has two input channels and two output channels;\nit receives two fluid droplets, one from each input, mixes them perfectly, and\nproduces two droplets of the mixed fluid on its output channels. Such a mixing\ngraph converts a set I of input droplets into a set T of output droplets, where\nthe droplets are specified by their reactant concentrations. The most\nfundamental algorithmic question related to mixing graphs is to determine,\ngiven an input set I and a target set T, whether there is a mixing graph that\nconverts I into T. We refer to this decision problem as mix-reachability. While\nthe complexity of this problem remains open, we provide a solution to its\nnatural sub-problem, called perfect mixability, in which we ask whether, given\na collection C of droplets, there is a mixing graph that mixes C perfectly,\nproducing only droplets whose concentration is the average concentration of C.\nWe provide a complete characterization of such perfectly mixable sets and an\nefficient algorithm for testing perfect mixability.

Numerous prior studies of the\ninterplanetary solar-wind have shown that, as plasma beta ($\\beta_{\\parallel\np}$) increases, a narrower range of temperature-anisotropy ($R_p\\equiv T_{\\perp\np}\\,/\\,T_{\\parallel p}$) values is observed. Conventionally, this effect has\nbeen ascribed to the actions of kinetic microinstabilities. This study is the\nfirst to use data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) to explore\nsuch $\\beta_{\\parallel p}$-dependent limits on $R_p$ in Earth's magnetosheath.\nThe distribution of these data across the $(\\beta_{\\parallel p},R_p)$-plane\nreveals limits on both $R_p>1$ and $R_p<1$. Linear Vlasov theory is used to\ncompute contours of constant growth-rate for the ion-cyclotron, mirror,\nparallel-firehose, and oblique-firehose instabilities. These instability\nthresholds closely align with the contours of the data distribution, which\nsuggests a strong association of instabilities with extremes of ion temperature\nanisotropy in the magnetosheath. The potential for instabilities to regulate\ntemperature anisotropy is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 01:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

This problem causes incorrectness of results in network\nanalysis and mining. The factual challenge is that character uniqueness is hard\nto correctly confirm due to lots of complicated factors, e.g. name changing and\nanonymization, leading to character duplication. Early, limited research has\nshown that previous methods depended overly upon supplementary attribute\ninformation from databases. In this paper, we propose a novel method to merge\nthe character vertices which refer to as the same entity but are denoted with\ndifferent names. With this method, we firstly build the relationship network\namong characters based on records of social activities participated, which are\nextracted from multimedia sources. Then define temporal activity paths (TAPs)\nfor each character over time. After that, we measure similarity of the TAPs for\nany two characters. If the similarity is high enough, the two vertices should\nbe considered to the same character. Based on TAPs, we can determine whether to\nmerge the two character vertices. Our experiments shown that this solution can\naccurately confirm character uniqueness in large-scale social network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 04:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Immersive VR experience requires the delivery of huge data at\nultra-low latency, thus demanding ultra-high transmission rate. This challenge\ncan be largely addressed by the recent network architecture known as mobile\nedge computing (MEC), which enables caching and computing capabilities at the\nedge of wireless networks. This paper presents a novel MEC-based mobile VR\ndelivery framework that is able to cache parts of the field of views (FOVs) in\nadvance and run certain post-processing procedures at the mobile VR device. To\noptimize resource allocation at the mobile VR device, we formulate a joint\ncaching and computing decision problem to minimize the average required\ntransmission rate while meeting a given latency constraint. When FOVs are\nhomogeneous, we obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal joint policy\nwhich reveals interesting communications-caching-computing tradeoffs. When FOVs\nare heterogeneous, we obtain a local optima of the problem by transforming it\ninto a linearly constrained indefinite quadratic problem then applying concave\nconvex procedure.

Here we start a more detailed investigation of this QCP\nusing a bosonic formulation for the effective action, where the bosons couple\nto the order parameter fields. To this end, we use the channel decomposition of\nthe fermionic effective action developed in [Phys. Rev.

It contains\nd-wave superconducting, magnetic, and density-density interactions. We analyze\nthe resulting phase diagram in the mean-field approximation. We show that the\nsingular fermionic self-energy suppresses gap formation both in the\nsuperconducting and magnetic channel already at the mean-field level, thus\nrounding a first-order transition (without self-energy) to a quantum phase\ntransition (with self-energy). We give a simple effective model that shows the\ngenerality of this effect. In the two-dimensional Hubbard model, the effective\ndensity-density interaction is peaked at a nonzero frequency, so that solving\nthe mean-field equations already involves a functional equation instead of\nsimply a matrix equation (on a technical level, similar to incommensurate\nphases).

Various types of deep\nneural network models have been introduced to time series analysis, but the\nimportant frequency information is yet lack of effective modeling. In light of\nthis, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based neural network structure called\nmultilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware\ndeep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of\nmultilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables\nthe fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based\non mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual\nClassification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for\ntime series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take\nall or partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input,\nand resort to the back propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters\nglobally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based frequency analysis\ninto deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR datasets and a\nreal-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our\ntime series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance\nanalysis method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those\ntime-series elements and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time\nseries analysis. This indeed indicates the interpretability advantage of mWDN,\nand can be viewed as an indepth exploration to interpretable deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 11:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

The optimal resonance at any given frequency is defined by the complex\nvalued dielectric constant that maximizes the absorption of the particle under\nthe quasistatic approximation and a passivity constraint. In particular, for an\nellipsoid aligned along the exciting field, the optimal material property is\ngiven by the complex conjugate of the pole position associated with the\npolarizability of the particle. In this paper, we employ classical Mie theory\nto analyze this approximation for spherical particles in a lossy surrounding\nmedium. It turns out that the quasistatic optimal plasmonic resonance is valid\nprovided that the electrical size of the particle is sufficiently small at the\nsame time as the external losses are sufficiently large.

Current measures scrutinize either\nlocal or global connectivity of the nodes and have been found to be inadequate\nfor social networks. Ignoring hierarchy and community structure, which are\ninherent in all human social networks, is the primary cause of this inadequacy.\nPositional hierarchy and embeddedness of an actor in the community are\nintuitively crucial determinants of his importance. The theory of social\ncapital asserts that an actor's importance is derived from his position in\nnetwork hierarchy as well as from the potential to mobilize resources through\nintra-community (bonding) and inter-community (bridging) ties. Inspired by this\nidea, we propose a novel centrality measure SC (Social Centrality) for actors\nin social networks. Our measure accounts for - i) an individual's propensity to\nsocialize, and ii) his connections within and outside the community. These two\nfactors are suitably aggregated to produce social centrality score. Comparative\nanalysis of SC measure with classical and recent centrality measures using\nlarge public networks shows that it consistently produces a more realistic\nranking of nodes. The inference is based on the available ground truth for each\ntested networks. Extensive analysis of rankings delivered by SC measure and\nmapping with known facts in well-studied networks justifies its effectiveness\nin diverse social networks. Scalability evaluation of SC measure justifies its\nefficacy for real-world large networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 13:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

We propose a novel\nneural network framework, neural outfit recommendation (NOR), that\nsimultaneously provides outfit recommendations and generates abstractive\ncomments. NOR consists of two parts: outfit matching and comment generation.\nFor outfit matching, we propose a convolutional neural network with a mutual\nattention mechanism to extract visual features. The visual features are then\ndecoded into a rating score for the matching prediction. For abstractive\ncomment generation, we propose a gated recurrent neural network with a\ncross-modality attention mechanism to transform visual features into a concise\nsentence. The two parts are jointly trained based on a multi-task learning\nframework in an end-to-end back-propagation paradigm. Extensive experiments\nconducted on an existing dataset and a collected real-world dataset show NOR\nachieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines for outfit\nrecommendation.

Understanding\nthe propagation in large-scale metapopulations and predicting the future\noutbreaks thus become crucially important for epidemic control and prevention.\nIn the literature, there have been a bulk of studies on modeling intra-city\nepidemic propagation but with the single population assumption (homogeneity).\nSome recent works on metapopulation propagation, however, focus on finding\nspecific human mobility physical networks to approximate diseases transmission\nnetworks, whose generality to fit different diseases cannot be guaranteed. In\nthis paper, we argue that the intra-city epidemic propagation should be modeled\non a metapopulation base, and propose a two-step method for this purpose. The\nfirst step is to understand the propagation system by inferring the underlying\ndisease infection network. To this end, we propose a novel network inference\nmodel called D$^2$PRI, which reduces the individual network into a\nsub-population network without information loss, and incorporates the power-law\ndistribution prior and data prior for better performance. The second step is to\npredict the disease propagation by extending the classic SIR model to a\nmetapopulation SIR model that allows visitors transmission between any two\nsub-populations. The validity of our model is testified on a real-life clinical\nreport data set about the airborne disease in the Shenzhen city, China. The\nD$^2$PRI model with the extended SIR model exhibit superior performance in\nvarious tasks including network inference, infection prediction and outbreaks\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 14:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

A tweet is considered to be important if it receives high number of\naffirmative reactions from other Twitter users via Retweets. Retweet count is\nthus considered as a surrogate measure for positive crowd-sourced reactions -\nhigh number of retweets of a tweet aid in making its topic trending. This in\nturn bolsters the social reputation of the author of the tweet. Since social\nreputation/impact of users/tweets influences many decisions (such as promoting\nbrands, advertisement etc.), several blackmarket syndicates have actively been\nengaged in producing fake retweets in a collusive manner. Users who want to\nboost the impact of their tweets approach the blackmarket services, and gain\nretweets for their own tweets by either paying money (Premium Services) or by\nretweeting other customers' tweets. Thus they become customers of blackmarket\nsyndicates and engage in fake activities. Interestingly, these customers are\nneither bots, nor even fake users - they are usually normal human beings; they\nexpress a mix of organic and inorganic retweeting activities, and there is no\nsynchronicity across their behaviors. In this paper, we make a first attempt to\ninvestigate such blackmarket customers engaged in producing fake retweets. We\ncollected and annotated a novel dataset comprising of customers of many\nblackmarket services and show how their social behavior differs from genuine\nusers. We then use state-of-the-art supervised models to detect three types of\ncustomers (bots, promotional, normal) and genuine users. We achieve a Macro\nF1-score of 0.87 with SVM, outperforming four other baselines significantly. We\nfurther design a browser extension, SCoRe which, given the link of a tweet,\nspots its fake retweeters in real-time. We also collected users' feedback on\nthe performance of SCoRe and obtained 85% accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 14:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Building on the recent success of Bet-and-Run approaches for\nrestarted local search solvers, we introduce an improved generic Bet-and-Run\nstrategy. The goal is to obtain the best possible results within a given time\nbudget t using a given black-box optimization algorithm. If no prior knowledge\nabout problem features and algorithm behavior is available, the question about\nhow to use the time budget most efficiently arises. We propose to first start\nk>=1 independent runs of the algorithm during an initialization budget t1<t,\npausing these runs, then apply a decision maker D to choose 1<=m<=k runs from\nthem (consuming t2>=0 time units in doing so), and then continuing these runs\nfor the remaining t3=t-t1-t2 time units. In previous Bet-and-Run strategies,\nthe decision maker D=currentBest would simply select the run with the best-\nso-far results at negligible time. We propose using more advanced methods to\ndiscriminate between \"good\" and \"bad\" sample runs, with the goal of increasing\nthe correlation of the chosen run with the a-posteriori best one. We test\nseveral different approaches, including neural networks trained or polynomials\nfitted on the current trace of the algorithm to predict which run may yield the\nbest results if granted the remaining budget.

Ultrasonic\nvelocity measurements, at varying directions to the compression axis, were\ncombined with mechanical measurements of axial and volumetric strain, during\ndirect loading and cyclic loading triaxial deformation tests.

At all confining pressures, brittle deformation in antigorite is\nassociated with a spectacular absence of stress-induced anisotropy and with no\nnoticeable dependence of wave velocities on axial compressive stress, prior to\nrock failure. The strength of antigorite samples is comparable to that of\ngranite, but the mechanical behaviour is elastic up to high stress\n($\\gtrsim80$\\% of rock strength) and non-dilatant. Microcracking is only\nobserved in antigorite specimens taken to failure and not in those loaded even\nat $90-95$\\% of their compressive strength.

The\nthree key components of our approach are: (1) a space-time, enhanced velocity,\ndomain decomposition approach that allows different mesh refinements and\ntime-step sizes in different subdomains while preserving local mass\nconservation, (2) a residual based error estimator to identify or mark regions\n(or subdomains) that pose non-linear convergence issues, and (3) a fully\ncoupled monolithic solver is also presented that solves the coarse and fine\nsubdomain problems, both in space and time, simultaneously.
