Solutions of such systems\nexist globally and are unique up until the first time they hit the origin, $t =\nt_b$, which we term `blowup'. However, infinitely many solutions may exist for\nlonger times. To study continuation past blowup, we introduce physically\nmotivated regularizations: they consist of smoothing the vector field in a\n$\\nu$--ball around the origin and then removing the regularization in the limit\n$\\nu\\to 0$. We show that this limit can be understood using a certain\nautonomous dynamical system obtained by a solution-dependent renormalization\nprocedure. This procedure maps the pre-blowup dynamics, $t < t_b$, to the\nsolution ending at infinitely large renormalized time. In particular, the\nasymptotic behavior as $t \\nearrow t_b$ is described by an attractor. The\npost-blowup dynamics, $t > t_b$, is mapped to a different renormalized solution\nstarting infinitely far in the past. Consequently, it is associated with\nanother attractor. The $\\nu$-regularization establishes a relation between\nthese two different \"lives\" of the renormalized system. We prove that, in some\ngeneric situations, this procedure selects a unique global solution (or a\nfamily of solutions), which does not depend on the details of the\nregularization. We provide concrete examples and argue that these situations\nare qualitatively similar to post-blowup scenarios observed in\ninfinite-dimensional models of turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 16:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Given a Kerr black hole\nof mass $M$ and spin $S = aM^2$, it is simple to characterize its orbits as\nfunctions of the orbit's geometry. How do the orbits change if the black hole\nis itself evolving? How do the orbits change if the orbiting body evolves? In\nthis paper, we consider a process that changes a black hole's mass and spin,\nacting such that the spacetime is described by the Kerr solution at any moment,\nor that changes the orbiting body's mass. Provided this change happens slowly,\nthe orbit's actions ($J_r, J_\\theta, J_\\phi$) are {\\it adiabatic invariants},\nand thus are constant during this process. By enforcing adiabatic invariance of\nthe actions, we deduce how an orbit evolves due to changes in the black hole's\nmass and spin and in the orbiting body's mass. We demonstrate the impact of\nthese results with several examples: how an orbit responds if accretion changes\na black hole's mass and spin; how it responds if the orbiting body's mass\nchanges due to accretion; and how the inspiral of a small body into a black\nhole is affected by change to the hole's mass and spin due to the gravitational\nradiation absorbed by the event horizon. In all cases, the effect is very\nsmall, but can be an order of magnitude or more larger than what was found in\nprevious work which did not take into account how the orbit responds due to\nthese effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 18:53:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 22:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 14:42:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 15:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Recently, Takeda & Tajitsu (2017) reported that\nabundance ratios of specific light elements (e.g., [C/Fe] or [O/Fe]) in Li-rich\ngiants of high activity tend to be anomalously high, which they suspected to be\nnothing but superficial caused by unusual atmospheric structure due to high\nactivity. Towards verifying this hypothesis, we determined the elemental\nabundances of the primary and the secondary of Capella based on the\ndisentangled spectrum of each component, in order to see whether any apparent\ndisagreement exists between the two, which should have been formed with the\nsame chemical composition. We found that the primary is slightly supersolar (by\n~+0.1dex) while the secondary is subsolar (by several tenths dex) for heavier\nelements such as Fe, resulting in a marked discrepancy between the primary and\nsecondary, though such a trend is not seen for light elements (e.g., C or O).\nThese observational facts suggest that anomalously large [X/Fe] ratios found in\nLi-rich giants were mainly due to an apparent decrease of Fe abundance, which\nwe speculate is caused by the overionization effect due to chromospheric UV\nradiation.

We find that this propensity field, up to notations, is\nequivalent to the Berry curvature in a two-band solid. The propensity field\ndirectly encodes optical propensity rules, extending our conclusions regarding\nthe role of propensity rules in defining the sign of forward-backward asymmetry\nfrom the specific case of chiral hydrogen to generic chiral systems. Optical\npropensity rules underlie the chiral response in photoelectron circular\ndichroism. The enantiosensitive flux of the propensity field through the sphere\nin momentum space determines the forward-backward asymmetry in unaligned\nmolecules and suggests a geometrical origin of the chiral response. This flux\nhas opposite sign for opposite enantiomers and vanishes for achiral molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 23:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 17:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

These anchors have been used to secure passive and\nactive devices, where active device such as robotic manipulators produce\nmotions that would excite the dynamics of the non-rigid abdominal wall. Hence,\nthere is a need to investigate the mechanical dynamics of the abdominal wall\ntissue in insufflated state, combined with magnetic anchoring, specifically its\nresponse to mechanical excitations and the expected disturbances to the\noperation of the anchored devices. In this paper, loading and unloading tests\nare performed on a corresponding porcine specimen for dynamics identification.\nThe experiment setup was constructed to emulate the insufflated state of the\nabdomen with the magnetically anchored mechanism. The tissue responses during\nunloading are captured and approximated with a general numerical model, which\nis in turn used for the dynamic analysis of the tissue using Bode plot. The\nresults showed that in such stretched and compressed state, the steady state\ndisplacement of the tissue is approximately zero. The maximum transient error\nwas found to be 1mm in displacement using a high magnetic anchoring force.\nSignificant attenuation of the disturbances due to the high stiffness and\ndamping of the abdominal wall, was observed from 100rad/s in the frequency\nresponse. If a robotic manipulator was attached to the anchoring device, the\ntypical operating frequency of movements would still produce unattenuated\ndisturbances. It is expected that some error compensation through suitable\ncontrol strategies is required. These outcomes establish the basis for the\ncontroller design and the design specification of the active\nmagnetically-anchored surgical devices for minimal disturbance impact onto the\nabdominal wall tissue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 02:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

The goal is to derive a distributed algorithm in which each\nagent obtains a local estimate of its own subset of the global parameter\nvector, based on local measurements as well as information received from its\nneighbours. A recent algorithm has been proposed, which yields the optimal\nsolution (i.e., the one that would be obtained using a centralized method) in\nfinite time, provided the communication network forms an acyclic graph. If\ninstead, the graph is cyclic, the only available alternative algorithm, which\nis based on iterative matrix inversion, achieving the optimal solution, does so\nasymptotically. However, it is also known that, in the cyclic case, the\nalgorithm designed for acyclic graphs produces a solution which, although non\noptimal, is highly accurate. In this paper we do a theoretical study of the\naccuracy of this algorithm, in communication networks forming cyclic graphs. To\nthis end, we provide bounds for the sub-optimality of the estimation error and\nthe estimation error covariance, for a class of systems whose topological\nsparsity and signal-to-noise ratio satisfy certain condition. Our results show\nthat, at each node, the accuracy improves exponentially with the so-called\nloop-free depth. Also, although the algorithm no longer converges in finite\ntime in the case of cyclic graphs, simulation results show that the convergence\nis significantly faster than that of methods based on iterative matrix\ninversion. Our results suggest that, depending on the loop-free depth, the\nstudied algorithm may be the preferred option even in applications with cyclic\ncommunication graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 08:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

To measure the\nelectron and positron beams, picking up of these two different bunches in real\ntime is of notable concern. Because the time interval between adjacent electron\nand positron bunches is quite small, for example, 6 ns in CEPC, high-speed\nswitch electronics is required. This paper presents the prototype design of a\nhigh-speed radio frequency (RF) electronics that can pick up nanosecond\npositron-electron beam bunches with a switching time of less than 6 ns. Fast\nseparation of electron and positron is achieved based on RF switches and\nprecise delay adjustment of the controlling signals (~10 ps). Initial tests\nhave been conducted in the laboratory to evaluate the performance of\nelectronics, the results indicate that this circuit can successfully pick up\nthe bunch signal within a time interval of 6 ns, which makes it possible to\nfurther measure the electron and position beams simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 10:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In particular, in\nmeasurement-based quantum computing, checking whether correct graph states are\ngenerated is essential for reliable quantum computing. Several verification\nprotocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are\nparticularly resource efficient: multiple copies are required to extract a\nsingle state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal one. The best protocol\ncurrently known requires $O(n^{15})$ copies of the state, where $n$ is the size\nof the graph state. In this paper, we construct a significantly more\nresource-efficient verification protocol for graph states that only requires\n$O(n^5\\log{n})$ copies. The key idea is to employ Serfling's bound, which is a\nprobability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing Serfling's bound also\nenables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable graph\nstates. Constructing a resource-efficient verification protocol for them is\nnon-trivial. For example, the previous verification protocols for qubit graph\nstates that use the quantum de Finetti theorem cannot be generalized to qudit\nand continuous-variable graph states without tremendously increasing the\nresource overhead. This is because the overhead caused by the quantum de\nFinetti theorem depends on the local dimension. On the other hand, in our\nprotocol, the resource overhead is independent of the local dimension, and\ntherefore generalizing to qudit or continuous-variable graph states does not\nincrease the overhead. The flexibility of Serfling's bound also makes our\nprotocol robust: our protocol accepts slightly noisy but still useful graph\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 12:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 04:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

To cope with\nthe latency constraints and to explicitly specify the trade-off between\nblocklength (latency) and reliability the normal approximation of the capacity\nof finite blocklength codes (FBCs) is adopted, in contrast to the classical\nShannon capacity formula. We first consider the non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA) based transmission scheme. However, due to heterogeneous latency\nconstraints and channel conditions at receivers, the conventional successive\ninterference cancellation may be infeasible. We thus study the problem by\nconsidering heterogeneous receiver conditions under different interference\nmitigation schemes and solve the corresponding NOMA design problems. It is\nshown that, though the energy function is not convex and does not have closed\nform expression, the studied NOMA problems can be globally solved\nsemi-analytically and with low complexity. Moreover, we propose a hybrid\ntransmission scheme that combines the time division multiple access (TDMA) and\nNOMA. Specifically, the hybrid scheme can judiciously perform bit and time\nallocation and take TDMA and NOMA as two special instances. To handle the more\nchallenging hybrid design problem, we propose a concave approximation of the\nFBC rate/capacity formula, by which we obtain computationally efficient and\nhigh-quality solutions.

Based on these\nresults we show how to assign weights to the edges of a graph representing the\nroad network such that minimum-weight paths in the graph, which can be computed\nwith standard shortest-path algorithms, correspond to adequate routes. Our\nmethod combines known algorithms for machine learning and the analysis of\ntrajectories in an innovative way and, thereby, constitutes a new comprehensive\nsolution for the problem of deriving routing preferences from initially\nunclassified trajectories. An important property of our method is that it\nyields reasonable results even if the given set of trajectories is sparse in\nthe sense that it does not cover all segments of the cycle network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 14:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Activation energy of phase transition increases from 120KJ/mol\n(x=0) to 140 KJ/mol (x=0.046) due to Ga-V co-doping. In anatase phase, lattice\nconstants increase by the effect of Ga3+ interstitials. This results in\ninhibition of phase transition. Anatase phase becomes stable up to ~650 C in\nco-doped sample whereas for pure TiO2 phase transition starts in between\n450-500 C. In anatase phase, strain increases due to co-doping which reduces\ncrystallite size. In rutile phase, grain growth process is enhanced due to\nco-doping and particles show a rod-like structure with majority 110 facets.\nBandgap decreases in both phases and reduced to a visible light region.

The on-detector trigger electronics\nmodules are able to identify muons with predefined transverse momentum values\n(pT) by executing a coincidence logic on signals coming from the various\ndetector layers. Then, on-detector trigger boards transfer trigger data to the\noff-detector electronics. A complex trigger system processes the incoming data\nby combining trigger information from the Barrel and the End-cap regions, and\nby providing the combined muon candidate to the Central Trigger Processor\n(CTP). For almost a decade, the Level-1 Trigger system has been operating very\nwell, despite the challenging requirements on trigger efficiency and\nperformance, and the continuously increasing LHC luminosity. In order to cope\nwith these constraints, various upgrades for the full trigger system were\nalready deployed, and others have been designed to be installed in the next\nyears. Most of the upgrades to the trigger system rely on state-of-the-art\ntechnologies, thus allowing to increase the processing power and data transfer\nbandwidth, and to design more complex trigger menus. As a consequence, more\ntrigger candidates might be selected by the system, thus supporting new physics\nstudies or topological selections. In this work, we discuss the design of the\nfirst prototype of the new Barrel Interface Board, designed around a Xilinx\nFPGA, which will be used to transfer RPC trigger data to the CTP system.

The\neffectiveness of the classification using CNNs drops rapidly when only a small\nnumber of spectra per substance are available for training (which is a typical\nsituation in real applications). Additionally, to accommodate new, previously\nunseen substance classes, the network must be retrained which is\ncomputationally intensive.

While this problem is easily\nsolved via interface field continuity, we treat it under the viewpoint of\nradiative self-consistency, with interior current sources gauged by\nohmic/polarization comparisons against those of the exterior medium. Radiative\nself-consistency yields an integral equation over the slab field giving a fully\nconstructive buildup of the reflected/transmitted contributions, without any\nneed for implicit determination via boundary conditions. Solution steps lead to\nan exact cancellation of the interior field, and bring in still other\ncontributions of a reference medium variety, required to balance the incoming\nexcitation. Such balancing provides the linear conditions for slab field\ndetermination. This two-step solution provides evidence of Ewald-Oseen\nextinction, even though the analytic framework here differs from the proofs\navailable. We solve the balancing equations by vector manipulation without\ndeterminants, and then offer a boundary value confirmation in the special case\nof perpendicular incidence.
