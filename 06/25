It is based on\nquestionnaires and interviews made shortly before and shortly after the\ndiscovery in 2012. We show, to begin with, that the discovery of a Standard\nModel (SM) Higgs boson was less expected than is sometimes assumed. Once the\nnew particle was shown to have properties consistent with SM expectations -\nalbeit with significant experimental uncertainties -, there was a broad\nagreement that 'a' Higgs boson had been found. Physicists adopted a twopronged\nstrategy. On the one hand, they treated the particle as a SM Higgs boson and\ntried to establish its properties with higher precision; on the other hand,\nthey searched for any hints of physics beyond the SM. This motivates our first\nphilosophical thesis: the Higgs discovery, being of fundamental importance and\nestablishing a new kind of particle, represented a crucial experiment if one\ninterprets this notion in an appropriate sense. By embedding the LHC into\nthetradition of previous precision experiments and the experimental strategies\nthus established, Duhemian underdetermination is kept at bay. Second, our case\nstudy suggests that criteria of theory (or model) preference should be\nunderstood as epistemic and pragmatic values that have to be weighed in factual\nresearch practice. The Higgs discovery led to a shift from pragmatic to\nepistemic values as regards the mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking.\nComplex criteria, such as naturalness, combine epistemic and pragmatic values,\nbut are coherently applied by the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 20:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

One source of failure in safety-critical CPS is\nwhen there are unstated assumptions in either the physical or cyber parts of\nthe system, and new components do not match those assumptions. In this work, we\npresent an automated method towards identifying unstated assumptions in CPS.\nDynamic specifications in the form of candidate invariants of both the software\nand physical components are identified using dynamic analysis (executing and/or\nsimulating the system implementation or model thereof).

The stability of beams'\nparameters in linear accelerators depends on the stability of amplitude and\nphase of the accelerating field. A LLRF control system regulates the\nelectromagnetic field inside accelerating modules based on the input RF\nsignals. Typically active mixers down-convert those signals, which are later\nsampled and digitized by ADCs. This field detection scheme necessitates\nsynthesis of a heterodyne/local oscillator (LO) signal which is often generated\nusing a passive mixer and a frequency divider. Additive close-to-carrier phase\nnoise can be observed in the aforementioned circuits. The phase noise of a\npassive mixer's output signal is typically calculated using a small-signal\nmodel based on modulation theory. Experimental results indicate that the power\nlevel of the input signals has a nonlinear effect on phase noise beyond the\nnoise floor. The frequency dividers' output phase noise was measured as a\nfunction of input power, input frequency, and division ratio. The influence of\nthe LO signal power level on the active mixers' output signal phase noise was\nmeasured and two hypotheses were made.

In current practice,\ntransit agencies add significant slack to the schedule and hold buses until\ntheir scheduled departure time at certain stations along the route. These\npractices can smooth out small disruptions but are not robust to large\ndisruptions. Various headway-based strategies have been proposed but these also\nrely on holding buses and therefore reduce their average pace. Transit signal\npriority (TSP) is commonly used to reduce the signal delay that buses\nexperience but the potential for signals to serve as an additional control\nagent to enhance bus reliability has not been systematically evaluated. We are\nespecially interested in evaluating conditional signal priority (CSP), in which\nbuses send priority requests only when a condition is met. A mathematical model\nbased on Brownian motion is proposed for bus systems with a schedule where\npairing is not a concern and is used to develop formulas for the expectation\nand variance of steady state deviation. Simulation is used to confirm these\nfindings and to evaluate the case of bus systems operated by headway where\npairing is a concern. The analytical and simulation results show that CSP can\nbe used not just to accelerate buses but to improve their reliability. CSP is\nas good as TSP in some scenarios and better in others. In all scenarios it is\nbetter for other traffic because it sends fewer priority requests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 02:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Such characteristics\nresult in various stacking orders that are energetically comparable but may\nsignificantly differ in terms of electronic structures, e.g. magnetism.\nInspired by several recent experiments showing interlayer\nanti-ferromagnetically coupled CrI3 bilayers, we carried out first-principles\ncalculations for CrI3 bilayers. We found that the anti-ferromagnetic coupling\nresults from a new stacking order with the C2/m space group symmetry, rather\nthan the graphene-like one with R3 as previously believed. Moreover, we\ndemonstrated that the intra- and inter-layer couplings in CrI3 bilayer are\ngoverned by two different mechanisms, namely ferromagnetic super-exchange and\ndirect-exchange interactions, which are largely decoupled because of their\nsignificant difference in strength at the strong- and weak-interaction limits.\nThis allows the much weaker interlayer magnetic coupling to be more feasibly\ntuned by stacking orders solely. Given the fact that interlayer magnetic\nproperties can be altered by changing crystal structure with different stacking\norders, our work opens a new paradigm for tuning interlayer magnetic properties\nwith the freedom of stacking order in two dimensional layered materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 03:35:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 08:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the\nresolvent of the linearized Navier-Stokes (LNS) equations forms an orthonormal\nset of I/O mode pairs, sorted in descending order by the magnitude of the\ncorresponding singular values. In this study we design a filter to restrict\ninput forcings to be active only in regions where turbulent kinetic energy\n(TKE) of jet turbulence is high. For an output domain, we directly implement\nthe Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) method within I/O analysis framework to\nmeasure far-field sound of observers distributed along an arc. In this way we\nfind that the resulting TKE-weighted input modes captures coherent structures\nin the near-field of turbulent jets. Optimal input modes correspond to\nwavepackets represented by asymmetric pseudo-Gaussian envelope functions at a\ngiven forcing frequency. These wavepackets remain similar in shape over a range\nof frequencies for $St > 0.5$, and scale as $St^{-0.5}$. While the optimal mode\nis a wavepacket, sub-optimal modes represent decoherence of the optimal input\nmode. By projecting high-fidelity large eddy simulation (LES) data onto the\nbasis of input modes, we find that input modes do indeed capture the\nacoustically relevant dynamics in the jet.

We focus on high-frequency solutions whose propagation can be\ndescribed, both at the continuous and semi-discrete level, by micro-local\ntools. We do it both for uniform and non-uniform numerical grids and also for\nconstant coefficients and variable ones. The energy of continuous and\nsemi-discrete high-frequency solutions propagates along bi-characteristic rays,\nbut their dynamics differ from the continuous to the semi-discrete setting,\nbecause of the different nature of the corresponding Hamiltonians. One of the\nmain objectives of this paper is to illustrate through accurate numerical\nsimulations that, in agreement with the micro-local theory, numerical\nhigh-frequency solutions can bend in an unexpected manner, as a result of the\naccumulation of the local effects introduced by the heterogeneity of the\nnumerical grid. These effects are enhanced in the multi-dimensional case where\nthe interaction and combination of such behaviors in the various space\ndirections may produce, for instance, the \"rodeo effect\", i. e. waves that are\ntrapped by the numerical grid in closed loops, without ever getting to the\nexterior boundary. Our analysis allows explaining all such pathological\nbehaviors. Moreover, the discussion in this paper also contributes to the\nexisting theory about the necessity of filtering high-frequency numerical\ncomponents when dealing with control and inversion problems for waves, which is\nbased very much in the theory of rays and, in particular, on the fact that they\ncan be observed when reaching the exterior boundary of the domain, a key\nproperty that can be lost through numerical discretization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 07:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Short higher-order control commands may hence be used\nto kick the system from one self-organized attractor robustly into the basin of\nattraction of a different attractor, a concept termed here as kick control. The\nindividual sensorimotor states serve in this context as highly compliant motor\nprimitives.\n  We study different implementations of kick control for the case of simulated\nand real-world wheeled robots, for which the dynamics of the distinct wheels is\ngenerated independently by local feedback loops. The feedback loops are\nmediated by rate-encoding neurons disposing exclusively of propriosensoric\ninputs in terms of projections of the actual rotational angle of the wheel. The\nchanges of the neural activity are then transmitted into a rotational motion by\na simulated transmission rod akin to the transmission rods used for steam\nlocomotives.\n  We find that the self-organized attractor landscape may be morphed both by\nhigher-level control signals, in the spirit of kick control, and by interacting\nwith the environment. Bumping against a wall destroys the limit cycle\ncorresponding to forward motion, with the consequence that the dynamical\nvariables are then attracted in phase space by the limit cycle corresponding to\nbackward moving.

The very existence of such orbits\nwhen motion is not confined in the equatorial plane, i.e. spherical orbits, is\nindeed a special property of the separable Kerr metric and may not occur, for\ninstance, in the spacetime of other more speculative ultracompact objects. In\nthis paper we consider a general stationary-axisymmetric spacetime and examine\nunder what circumstances spherical or more general, variable-radius,\n`spheroidal' non-equatorial photon orbits may exist with the ultimate goal of\nusing the modifications -- or even loss -- of photon trapping orbits as a\ntelltale of non-Kerr physics. In addressing this issue, we first derive a\ngeneral necessary condition for the existence of spherical/spheroidal orbits\nand then go on to study photon trapping orbits in a variety of known non-Kerr\nmetrics (Johannsen, Johanssen-Psaltis, and Hartle-Thorne). The first of these\nis an example of a separable spacetime which supports Kerr-like spherical\nphoton orbits. A more detailed analysis reveals a deeper connection between the\npresence of spherical orbits and the separability of a metric (that is, the\nexistence of a third integral of motion). Specifically, a spacetime that does\nnot admit spherical orbits in any coordinates is necessarily non-separable. The\nother two spacetimes considered here exhibit a clear non-Kerr behaviour by\nhaving spherical photon orbits replaced by spheroidal ones. More importantly,\nsubject to the degree of deviation from Kerr, equatorial photon rings give\nplace to non-equatorial ones with an accompanying loss of low-inclination\nspheroidal orbits. The implications of these results for the electromagnetic\nand gravitational wave signature of non-Kerr objects are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 09:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 15:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

The methods are semi-intrusive in the sense\nthat inspection of the model is limited up to the level of the single scale\nsystems, and viewing these single scale components as black-boxes. The goal is\nto estimate uncertainty in the result of multiscale models at a reduced amount\nof time as compared to black-box Monte Carlo (MC). In the resulting\nsemi-intrusive MC method, the required number of samples of an expensive single\nscale model is minimized in order to reduce the execution time for the overall\nUP. In the metamodeling approach, the expensive model component is replaced\ncompletely by a computationally much cheaper surrogate model. These\nsemi-intrusive algorithms have been tested on two case studies based on\nreaction-diffusion dynamics. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nsemi-intrusive methods can result in a significant reduction of the\ncomputational time for multiscale UP, while still computing accurately the\nestimates of uncertainties. The semi-intrusive methods can, therefore, be a\nvalid alternative, when uncertainties of a multiscale model cannot be estimated\nby the black-box MC methods in a feasible amount of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 09:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 12:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 10:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

Unfortunately, owing to the small spatial scales\non which reconnection is thought to occur, it is not directly observable in the\nsolar corona. However, larger scale processes, such as associated inflow and\noutflow, and signatures of accelerated particles have been put forward as\nevidence of reconnection. We explore the origin of a persistent Type I radio\nsource that accompanies a coronal X--shaped structure during its passage across\nthe disk. Of particular interest is the time range around a partial collapse of\nthe structure that is associated with inflow, outflow, and signatures of\nparticle acceleration. Imaging radio observations from the NRH were used to\nlocalise the radio source. SDO AIA EUV observations from the same time period\nwere analysed, looking for evidence of inflows and outflows. Further\n\\texttt{mpole} magnetic reconstructions using SDO HMI observations allowed the\nmagnetic connectivity associated with the radio source to be determined. The\nType I radio source was well aligned with a magnetic separator identified in\nthe extrapolations. During the partial collapse, gradual (1 km/s) and fast (5\nkm/s) inflow phases and fast (30 km/s) and rapid (80-100 km/s) outflow phases\nwere observed, resulting in an estimated reconnection rate of ~ 0.06. The radio\nsource brightening and dimming was found to be co-temporal with increased soft\nx-ray emission in both RHESSI and GOES. We interpret the brightening and\ndimming of the radio emission as evidence for accelerated electrons in the\nreconnection region responding to a gradual fall and rapid rise in electric\ndrift velocity, in response to the inflowing and outflowing field lines.

We use two hydrodynamical,\ncosmological simulations to predict possible trends for two self-consistent\nvariable IMF prescriptions that respectively become locally bottom-heavy or\ntop-heavy in high-pressure environments. Both simulations have been calibrated\nto reproduce the observed correlation between central stellar velocity\ndispersion and the excess mass-to-light ratio (MLE) relative to a Salpeter IMF\nby increasing the mass fraction of, respectively, dwarf stars or stellar\nremnants. We find trends of MLE with galaxy age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] that\nagree qualitatively with observations. Predictions for correlations with\nluminosity, half-light radius, and black hole mass are presented. The\nsignificance of many of these correlations depends sensitively on galaxy\nselection criteria such as age, luminosity, and morphology. For an IMF with a\nvarying high-mass end, some of these correlations are stronger than the\ncorrelation with the birth ISM pressure (the property that governs the form of\nthe IMF), because in this case the MLE has a strong age dependence. Galaxies\nwith large MLE tend to have overmassive central black holes. This indicates\nthat the abnormally high MLE observed in the centres of some high-mass galaxies\ndoes not imply that overmassive BHs are merely the result of incorrect IMF\nassumptions, nor that excess M/L ratios are solely the result of overmassive\nBHs.

From the calculation\nof the full dipole response function in QRPA, discretizing the continuum in a\nspherical box of radius of 40 fm, one finds a GDR with centroid $E_x \\approx\n24$ MeV, width $\\Gamma \\approx$ 11 MeV and carrying 90\\% of the EWSR, and a\nlow--lying collective resonance characterized by $E_X = 0.75$ MeV, $\\Gamma =\n0.5$ MeV and $6.2\\%$ EWSR The wave function of the latter resonance is built\nout of about fifteen components (both protons and neutrons), typical of a\ncollective mode. The transition densities indicate this soft $E1$--mode to be\ngenerated by surface density oscillation of the neutron skin ($\\Delta r_{np}\n\\approx 1.71$ fm) relative to an approximately isospin--saturated core. Through\na detailed study of the full dipole response of $^{11}$Li we will draw a\ncomparison between the soft $E1$--mode of this halo nucleus and the PDR of\nheavy stable nuclei, pointing to the physical similarities and also to the\nbasic differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 12:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 15:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 14:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In these\ncomponent systems, Zipf's law describes the empirical power law distribution of\ncomponent frequencies. Stochastic processes based on a sample-space-reducing\n(SSR) mechanism, in which the number of accessible states reduces as the system\nevolves, have been recently proposed as a simple explanation for the ubiquitous\nemergence of this law. However, many complex component systems are\ncharacterized by other statistical patterns beyond Zipf's law, such as a\nsublinear growth of the component vocabulary with the system size, known as\nHeap's law, and a specific statistics of shared components.

Consequently a gradient in temperature is created across the poles of\nthe sphere due to different interfacial resistance across the solid-fluid\nboundary in the two hemispheres. It is this self-created temperature gradient\nwhich leads to a self-propulsion along the direction of the symmetry axis. In\nthis article, we look at the orientational dynamics of such a system, as well\nas the subsequent enhancement of the translational diffusivity at late times.\nThe orientational correlation of the symmetry axis is measured from the\nsimulation and provides a direct access to the rotational diffusion constant.\nThe heating leads to an increase in the rotational diffusivity of the colloid.\nWe quantify this increase in rotational diffusion against the temperature\ndifference across the poles of the Janus sphere as well as the average surface\ntemperature difference from the ambient fluid.We show that later quantification\nis better and results in a data collapse for different choices of the\nmicroscopic interaction.

In this paper, we focus on $\\omega$ Cen, a peculiar, massive\nGGC that hosts multiple stellar populations. We use non-LTE model atmospheres\nto derive atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g and N(He)/N(H)) and spectroscopic\nmasses for 152 EHB stars in the cluster. This constitutes the largest\nspectroscopic sample of EHB stars ever analyzed in a GGC and represents ~20% of\nthe EHB population of $\\omega$ Cen. We also search for close binaries among\nthese stars based on radial velocity variations. Our results show that the EHB\npopulation of $\\omega$ Cen is divided into three spectroscopic groups that are\nvery distinct in the Teff - helium abundance plane. The majority of our sample\nconsists of sdOB stars that have roughly solar or super-solar atmospheric\nhelium abundances. It is these objects that constitute the blue hook at $V >$\n18.5 mag in the $\\omega$ Cen color-magnitude diagram. Interestingly, the\nhelium-enriched sdOBs do not have a significant counterpart population in the\nGalactic field. Another major difference between the EHB stars in $\\omega$ Cen\nand the field is the fraction of close binaries. From our radial velocity\nsurvey we identify two binary candidates and estimate an EHB close binary\nfraction of ~5% in $\\omega$ Cen. This low fraction is in line with findings for\nother GGCs, but in sharp contrast to the situation in the field, where around\n50% of the sdB stars reside in close binaries. Finally, the mass distribution\nderived is very similar for all three spectroscopic groups, however the average\nmass (0.38 Msun) is lower than that expected from stellar evolution theory.\nWhile this mass conundrum has previously been noted for EHB stars in $\\omega$\nCen, it so far appears to be unique to that cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 13:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Regarding the problem of indexing, we describe\ncompressed, exact and lossless data structures that achieve, at the same time,\nhigh space reductions and no time degradation with respect to state-of-the-art\nsolutions and related software packages. In particular, we present a compressed\ntrie data structure in which each word following a context of fixed length k,\ni.e., its preceding k words, is encoded as an integer whose value is\nproportional to the number of words that follow such context.

Plug-In\nHybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) consume two fuel sources (i.e., gasoline and\nelectricity energy sources) with floating prices. To reduce drivers' total fuel\ncost, recommending economical routes to them becomes one of the effective\nmethods. In this paper, we present a novel economical path-planning framework\ncalled Eco-Route, which consists of two phases. In the first phase, we build a\ndriving route cost model (DRCM) for each PHEV (and driver) under the energy\nmanagement strategy, based on driving condition and vehicles' parameters. In\nthe second phase, with the real-time traffic information collected via the\nmobile crowdsensing manner, we are able to estimate and compare the driving\ncost among the shortest and the fastest routes for a given PHEV, and then\nrecommend the driver with the more economical one. We evaluate the two-phase\nframework using 8 different PHEVs simulated in Matlab/Simulink, and the\nreal-world datasets consisting of the road network, POI and GPS trajectory data\ngenerated by 559 taxis in seven days in Beijing, China. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model achieves good accuracy, with a mean cost\nerror of less 8% when paths length is longer than 5 km.

In this paper we present a study of the\ninterstellar medium in the compact, peaked-spectrum radio galaxy PKSB1934-63\nusing X-shooter observations. Most of the warm ionized gas resides within a\ncircum-nuclear disk with a radius of about 200pc that is likely to constitute\nthe gas reservoir from which the central black hole feeds. On the other hand,\nwe find a biconical outflow of warm ionized gas with an estimated radius of\n59+/-12pc. This matches the radial extent of the radio source and suggests that\nthe outflow is jet driven. Thanks to the superior wavelength coverage of the\ndata, we can estimate the density of the warm ionized gas using the\ntrans-auroral line technique, and we find that the outflowing gas has\nremarkably high density, up to n_e~10^5.5cm^-3 . The estimated mass outflow\nrate is low (M_dot=10^-3 - 10^-1 M_solar/yr) and the AGN feedback operates at\nrelatively low efficiency (E_dot/L_bol~10^-4 - 10^-3 %), in contrast to\npredictions of theoretical models. In addition, optical and near-IR line ratios\nshow that the expansion of the radio source drives fast shocks (with velocities\nv>500km/s) that ionize and accelerate the outflowing gas. At odds with the\nproperties of other compact, peaked-spectrum radio sources hosting warm ionized\ngas outflows, we do not find signs of kinematically disturbed or outflowing gas\nin phases colder than the warm ionized gas.

The liquid meniscus between droplets can\ntransmit stress and instigate movement of the droplets, from their initial\nrelative position, in order to minimize doublet surface energy. The action of\nthe liquid meniscus causes the ellipsoidal droplets to undergo rolling and\nrestructuring events because of their unique ellipsoid shape and associated\nvariation in surface curvature.

Observations of animal\ntrajectories using telemetry devices provide researchers with information about\nthe way animals interact with their environment and each other. For many\nspecies, specific geographical features in the landscape can have a strong\neffect on behavior. Such features may correspond to a single point (e.g., dens\nor kill sites), or to higher-dimensional subspaces (e.g., rivers or lakes).\nFeatures may be relatively static in time (e.g., coastlines or home-range\ncenters), or may be dynamic (e.g., sea ice extent or areas of high-quality\nforage for herbivores). We introduce a novel model for animal movement that\nincorporates active selection for dynamic features in a landscape.\n  Our approach is motivated by the study of polar bear (Ursus maritimus)\nmovement. During the sea ice melt season, polar bears spend much of their time\non sea ice above shallow, biologically productive water where they hunt seals.\nThe changing distribution and characteristics of sea ice throughout the late\nspring through early fall means that the location of valuable habitat is\nconstantly shifting.

Three-dimensional non-linear\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations present the advantage of having only a small\nnumber of tunable parameters, and produce in a dynamically self-consistent\nmanner the flows and the dynamo magnetic fields pervading stellar interiors.

In particular, we focus on the characterization of the\nnuclear activity. This analysis has been performed on rest-frame optical\nspectra taken with LBT-LUCI. The spectral coverage allowed us to observe\nemission lines such as Halpha, Hbeta, [Oiii]5007 A, and [Nii]6583 A at the z of\nthe central RG. We observed the central part of the protocluster, which is\nsuitable to include the radio galaxy, several spectroscopically confirmed AGN\nbelonging to the protocluster, and other objects that might be members of the\nprotocluster. For four previously identified protocluster members, we derived\nthe redshift by detecting emission lines that have never detected before for\nthese galaxies. The stacked spectrum of the galaxies in which we detected the\n[Oiii]5007 A emission line revealed the presence of the second line of the\n[Oiii] doublet at 4959 A and of Hbeta, which confirms that they belong to the\nprotocluster.

This protocluster is characterized by a high fraction of AGN (23%).\nFor one of them, AGN1317, we produced 2 BPT diagrams.

We focus on\nthe two key surprises of quantum physics, namely wave-particle duality, a term\nthat was introduced to capture the fact that single quantum particles in some\nrespects behave like waves and in other respects like particles, and\nentanglement, which applies to two or more quantum particles and brings out the\ninherent contradiction between quantum physics and seemingly obvious\nassumptions regarding the nature of reality. Following arguments originally\nmade by John Bell and Lucien Hardy, we show that the so-called local hidden\nvariables are inadequate at explaining the behavior of entangled quantum\nparticles. This means that one either has to give up on hidden variables, i.e.,\nthe idea that the outcomes of measurements on quantum particles are determined\nbefore an experiment is actually carried out, or one has to relinquish the\nprinciple of locality, which requires that no causal influences should be\nfaster than the speed of light and is a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of\nrelativity. Finally, we describe how these remarkable predictions of quantum\nphysics have been confirmed in experiments. We have successfully used the\npresent approach in a course that is open to all undergraduate students at the\nUniversity of Calgary, without any prerequisites in mathematics or physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 12:52:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 10:33:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 19:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

This evaluation was done by an experienced VHDL\nprogrammer with no prior HLS training. For the crystal identification module,\nboth HDL and HLS versions have the same event processing interval, and the HLS\nimplementation consumes twice as many lookup tables and flip flops as the HDL\nversion. On the other hand, the HLS version took half the time to write and\ndebug. For the sorter module, the HLS version requires about 3 to 4 times more\nlogic resources, with a slightly longer processing interval. It was also\ncompleted in half the time compared to the original HDL code. While different\ncompiler directives can still be explored to improve source code clarity,\nresource usage and timing closure in these designs, this trial shows that HLS\nis a compelling alternative to custom HDL implementations for real time systems\nin nuclear and plasma science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 19:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

The continualization technique\nhere proposed is based on a transformation of the difference equation of motion\nof the discrete system via a proper down-scaling law into a pseudo-differential\nproblem; a further McLaurin approximation is applied to obtain a higher order\ndifferential problem. The formulation is carried out for simple one-dimensional\nbeam lattices that are, nevertheless, characterized by a rather wide variety of\nstatic and dynamic behaviors: the rod lattice, the beam lattice with node\nrotations and a 1D beam lattice model with generalized displacements. Higher\norder models may be obtained which are characterized by differential problems\ninvolving non-local inertia terms together with spatial high gradient terms.\nMoreover, the homogenized models obtained by the proposed enhanced\ncontinualization technique turn out to be energetically consistent and provide\na good simulation of both the static response and of the acoustic spectrum of\nthe original discrete models.
