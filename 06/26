Boundary twists in the vicinity of an edge due to\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions have been first discussed in [Wilson et al.,\nPhys. Rev. B 88, 214420 (2013)] and in [Rohart and Thiaville, Phys. Rev. B 88,\n184422 (2013)]. We show that in general case the boundary conditions lead to\nthe magnetization profile corresponding to the N\\'eel, Bloch, or intermediate\ntwist. We explore how such twists can be utilized for creation of skyrmions and\nantiskyrmions, e.g., in a view of magnetic memory applications. To this end, we\nstudy various scenarios how skyrmions and antiskyrmions can be created from\ninterface magnetization twists due to local instabilities. We also show that a\njudicious choice of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya tensor (hence a carefully designed\nmaterial) can lead to local instabilities generating certain types of skyrmions\nor antiskyrmions. The local instabilities are shown to appear in solutions of\nthe Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations describing ellipticity of magnon modes bound\nto interfaces. In one considered scenario, a skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair can be\ncreated due to instabilities at an interface between materials with properly\nengineered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We use micromagnetics\nsimulations to confirm our analytical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 16:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 16:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 13:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

As a\nresult, estimating the amount of resources that need to be preloaded during a\nsurfer's browsing becomes an important task. In this regard, prefetching can be\nmodeled as a two-player combinatorial game [Fomin et al., Theoretical Computer\nScience 2014], where a surfer and a marker alternately play on a given graph\n(representing the Web graph). During its turn, the marker chooses a set of $k$\nnodes to mark (prefetch), whereas the surfer, represented as a token resting on\ngraph nodes, moves to a neighboring node (Web resource). The surfer's objective\nis to reach an unmarked node before all nodes become marked and the marker\nwins. Intuitively, since the surfer is step-by-step traversing a subset of\nnodes in the Web graph, a satisfactory prefetching procedure would load in\ncache all resources lying in the neighborhood of this growing subset.\n  Motivated by the above, we consider the following problem to which we refer\nto as the Maximum Rooted Connected Expansion (MRCE) problem. Given a graph $G$\nand a root node $v_0$, we wish to find a subset of vertices $S$ such that $S$\nis connected, $S$ contains $v_0$ and the ratio $|N[S]|/|S|$ is maximized, where\n$N[S]$ denotes the closed neighborhood of $S$, that is, $N[S]$ contains all\nnodes in $S$ and all nodes with at least one neighbor in $S$.\n  We prove that the problem is NP-hard even when the input graph $G$ is\nrestricted to be a split graph. On the positive side, we demonstrate a\npolynomial time approximation scheme for split graphs. Furthermore, we present\na $\\frac{1}{6}(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-approximation algorithm for general graphs based\non techniques for the Budgeted Connected Domination problem [Khuller et al.,\nSODA 2014]. Finally, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for the special\ncase of interval graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 16:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

In spite of its importance, the direct effects of AF on the arterial\nhemodynamic patterns are not completely known to date. Based on a multiscale\nmodelling approach, the proposed work investigates the effects of AF on the\nlocal arterial fluid dynamics. AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) conditions are\nsimulated extracting 2000 $\\mathrm{RR}$ heartbeats and comparing the most\nrelevant cardiac and vascular parameters at the same HR (75 bpm). Present\noutcomes evidence that the arterial system is not able to completely absorb the\nAF-induced variability, which can be even amplified towards the peripheral\ncirculation. AF is also able to locally alter the wave dynamics, by modifying\nthe interplay between forward and backward signals. The sole heart rhythm\nvariation (i.e., from NSR to AF) promotes an alteration of the regular dynamics\nat the arterial level which, in terms of pressure and peripheral perfusion,\nsuggests a modification of the physiological phenomena ruled by periodicity\n(e.g., regular organ perfusion)and a possible vascular dysfunction due to the\nprolonged exposure to irregular and extreme values.

By allowing operators to deflect\ntraffic from the default BGP route, SDN policies are susceptible of creating\npermanent forwarding loops invisible to the control-plane.\n  In this paper, we propose a system, called Prelude, for detecting SDN-induced\nforwarding loops between SDXes with high accuracy without leaking the private\nrouting information of network operators. To achieve this, we leverage Secure\nMulti-Party Computation (SMPC) techniques to build a novel and general\nprivacy-preserving primitive that detects whether any subset of SDN rules might\naffect the same portion of traffic without learning anything about those rules.\nWe then leverage that primitive as the main building block of a distributed\nsystem tailored to detect forwarding loops among any set of SDXes. We leverage\nthe particular nature of SDXes to further improve the efficiency of our SMPC\nsolution.\n  The number of valid SDN rules, i.e., not creating loops, rejected by our\nsolution is 100x lower than previous privacy-preserving solutions, and also\nprovides better privacy guarantees. Furthermore, our solution naturally\nprovides network operators with some hindsight on the cost of the deflected\npaths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 17:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

The chromosphere is\noptically thick at many wavelengths and described by non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (NLTE), making it difficult to interpret observations. Furthermore,\nthere is considerable evidence that the atmosphere is filamented, and that\ncurrent instruments do not sufficiently resolve small scale features. In\nflares, it is likely that multithreaded models are required to describe the\nheating. The combination of NLTE effects and multithreaded modeling requires\ncomputationally demanding calculations, which has motivated the development of\na model that can efficiently treat both. We describe the implementation of a\nsolver in a hydrodynamic code for the hydrogen level populations that\napproximates the NLTE solutions.

It is shown that the evolution of V with\nheliocentric distance r depends substantially on both the heliolatitude and the\nsolar activity cycle. Deviations from the predicted Parker's profile of V(r)\nare so considerable that cannot be explained by a scarcity of measurements or\nother technical effects. In particular, the expected smooth growth of the solar\nwind speed with r is typical only for the solar activity maximum and for low\nheliolatitudes (lower than +/-40deg), while at high latitudes, there are two\nV(r) branches: growing and falling. In the solar activity maximum, V increases\ntoward the solar pole in the North hemisphere only; however, in the South\nhemisphere, it decreases with heliolatitude. In the minimum of solar activity,\nthe profile of V(r) at low heliolatitudes has a local minimum between 2 and 5\nAU. This result is confirmed by the corresponding data from other spacecraft\n(Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10). Unexpected spatial variations in V at low\nheliolatitudes can be explained by the impact of coronal hole flows on the V(r)\nprofile since the flows incline to the ecliptic plane. To reproduce the impact\nof spatial variations of V in the polar corona on the behavior of V at low\nheliolatitudes, a stationary one-fluid ideal MHD-model is developed with\naccount of recent results on imagery of the solar wind speed in the corona up\nto 5.5 solar radii obtained on the basis of combined observations from\nSOHO/UVCS, LASCO, and Mauna Loa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 17:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 20:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

While this freedom leads to a quantum anomaly, there is no\ncorresponding axial background field coupling differently to opposite\nchiralities in quantum electrodynamics. Here, we provide the experimental\ncharacterization of the effect of such an axial field in an acoustic\nmetamaterial. We implement the axial field through an inhomogeneous potential\nand observe the induced chiral Landau levels. From the metamaterials\nperspective these chiral channels open the possibility for the observation of\nnon-local Weyl orbits and might enable unidirectional bulk transport in a\ntime-reversal invariant system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

Therefore studies with simulated galaxy clusters have flourished.\nHowever detailed comparisons between simulated and observed clusters and their\npopulation - the galaxies - are complicated by the diversity of clusters and\ntheir surrounding environment. An original way initiated by Bertschinger as\nearly as 1987, to legitimize the one-to-one comparison exercise down to the\ndetails, is to produce simulations constrained to resemble the cluster under\nstudy within its large scale environment. Subsequently several methods have\nemerged to produce simulations that look like the local Universe. This paper\nhighlights one of these methods and its essential steps to get simulations that\nnot only resemble the local Large Scale Structure but also that host the local\nclusters. It includes a new modeling of the radial peculiar velocity\nuncertainties to remove the observed correlation between the decreases of the\nsimulated cluster masses and of the amount of data used as constraints with the\ndistance from us. This method has the particularity to use solely radial\npeculiar velocities as constraints: no additional density constraints are\nrequired to get local cluster simulacra. The new resulting simulations host\ndark matter halos that match the most prominent local clusters such as Coma.\nZoom-in simulations of the latter and of a volume larger than the 30 Mpc/h\nradius inner sphere become now possible to study local clusters and their\neffects.

The development of MRI techniques has enabled the\nquantification of brain development. A key quantity that can be extracted from\nMRI measurements is the level of myelination, where myelin acts as an insulator\naround nerve fibers and its deployment makes nerve pulse propagation more\nefficient. The co-variation of myelin deployment across different brain regions\nprovides insights into the co-development of brain regions and can be assessed\nas a correlation matrix that varies with age. Typically, available data for\neach child are very sparse, due to the cost and logistic difficulties of\narranging MRI brain scans for infants. We showcase here a method where data per\nsubject are limited to measurements taken at only one random age, while aiming\nat the time-varying dynamics. This situation is encountered more generally in\ncross-sectional studies where one observes $p$-dimensional vectors at one\nrandom time point per subject and is interested in the $p \\times p$ correlation\nmatrix function over the time domain. The challenge is that at each observation\ntime one observes only a $p$-vector of measurements but not a covariance or\ncorrelation matrix. For such very sparse data, we develop a Fr\\'echet\nestimation method. Given a metric on the space of covariance matrices, the\nproposed method generates a matrix function where at each time the matrix is a\nnon-negative definite covariance matrix, for which we demonstrate consistency\nproperties. We discuss how this approach can be applied to myelin data in the\ndeveloping brain and what insights can be gained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 20:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Finally, we find that the trans-relativistic object SN\n2009bb even if it produces more modest magnetic field amplification can\naccelerate CRs up to 2-3 PeV within 20 days after the outburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 20:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Using the package, ground-based photometric observations taken\nbetween $3,000$ and $12,000$ $\\AA$ can be corrected for atmospheric effects due\nto PWV. Atmospheric transmission in the optical and near-infrared is highly\ndependent on the PWV column density along the line of sight. By measuring the\ndelay of dual-band GPS signals through the atmosphere, the SuomiNet project\nprovides accurate PWV measurements for hundreds of locations around the world.\nThe pwv_kpno package uses published SuomiNet data in conjunction with MODTRAN\nmodels to determine the modeled, time-dependent atmospheric transmission. A\ndual-band GPS system was installed at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in\nthe spring of 2015. Using measurements from this receiver we demonstrate that\nwe can successfully predict the PWV at KPNO from nearby dual-band GPS stations\non the surrounding desert floor. The pwv_kpno package can thus provide\natmospheric transmission functions for observations taken before the KPNO\nreceiver was installed. Using PWV measurements from the desert floor, we\ncorrectly model PWV absorption features present in spectra taken at KPNO. We\nalso demonstrate how to configure the package for use at other observatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 21:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 16:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

This is a classical problem in\nstatistics, commonly referred to as the missing mass estimation problem. Recent\nresults by Ohannessian and Dahleh \\citet{Oha12} and Mossel and Ohannessian\n\\citet{Mos15} showed: i) the impossibility of estimating (learning) the missing\nmass without imposing further structural assumptions on the type proportions;\nii) the consistency of the Good-Turing estimator for the missing mass under the\nassumption that the tail of the type proportions decays to zero as a regularly\nvarying function with parameter $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$.

Baqprop encodes error\ninformation in relative phases of a quantum wavefunction defined over the space\nof network parameters; it can be thought of as the unification of the phase\nkickback principle of quantum computation and of the backpropagation algorithm\nfrom classical deep learning. We propose two core heuristics which leverage\nBaqprop for quantum-enhanced optimization of network parameters: Quantum\nDynamical Descent (QDD) and Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent (MoMGrad).\nQDD uses simulated quantum coherent dynamics for parameter optimization,\nallowing for quantum tunneling through the hypothesis space landscape. MoMGrad\nleverages Baqprop to estimate gradients and thereby perform gradient descent on\nthe parameter landscape; it can be thought of as the quantum-classical analogue\nof QDD. In addition to these core optimization strategies, we propose various\nmethods for parallelization, regularization, and meta-learning as augmentations\nto MoMGrad and QDD. We introduce several quantum-coherent adaptations of\ncanonical classical feedforward neural networks, and study how Baqprop can be\nused to optimize such networks. We develop multiple applications of parametric\ncircuit learning for quantum data, and show how to perform Baqprop in each\ncase. One such application allows for the training of hybrid quantum-classical\nneural-circuit networks, via the seamless integration of Baqprop with classical\nbackpropagation. Finally, for a representative subset of these proposed\napplications, we demonstrate the training of these networks via numerical\nsimulations of implementations of QDD and MoMGrad.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 23:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Developing\neffective methods for performing these separations is possible by designing new\nchelating agents that form stable complexes with actinide elements, and by\ninvestigating the interactions between the chelating agents and the actinide\nelements.

A proposed strategy is using a compliant flooring for an\nenvironment because it can reduce the stiffness of the ground. In this study,\nwe proposed that if a rigid layer is mounted on a compliant flooring\n(double-layer flooring), the impact force is further reduced. In order to\ninvestigate this goal, we designed two subjective laboratory experiments. In\nexperiment 1, the subjects were instructed falling to the ground where was\ncovered by a single layer of compliant material (a foam pad). In experiment 2,\nthe subjects fell on double-layer flooring when one rigid layer (a wood\nsurface) was mounted on the compliant layer. The impact forces were measured\nfor two short forward fall heights onto the outstretched hand. The results\nshowed that the profile of the impact forces consists of two peaks. The first\npeak has a higher magnitude, and it is followed by the second peak with a lower\nmagnitude. Comparing the magnitude of the first peak between two experiments\nshows a reduction of the impact force in experiment 2. In contrast, the\nmagnitudes of second peaks are identical for both experiments. Therefore, we\nconcluded that using a double-layer flooring, i.e.one rigid layer and one\ncompliant layer can be an effective strategy for considerably reducing the\nimpact force, and preventing the wrist fractures during the forward fall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 01:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 09:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

A core theoretical question is to provide bounds on the possible\namount of extrapolation, depending on the sample perturbation level and the\nfunction prior. In this paper we consider soft extrapolation of entire\nfunctions of finite order and type (containing the class of bandlimited\nfunctions as a special case), multiplied by a super-exponentially decaying\nwindow (such as a Gaussian). We consider a weighted least-squares polynomial\napproximation with judiciously chosen number of terms and a number of samples\nwhich scales linearly with the degree of approximation. It is shown that this\nsimple procedure provides stable recovery with an extrapolation factor which\nscales logarithmically with the perturbation level and is inversely\nproportional to the characteristic lengthscale of the function. The pointwise\nextrapolation error exhibits a H\\\"{o}lder-type continuity with an exponent\nderived from weighted potential theory, which changes from 1 near the available\nsamples, to 0 when the extrapolation distance reaches the characteristic\nsmoothness length scale of the function. The algorithm is asymptotically\nminimax, in the sense that there is essentially no better algorithm yielding\nmeaningfully lower error over the same smoothness class. When viewed in the\ndual domain, the above problem corresponds to (stable) simultaneous\nde-convolution and super-resolution for objects of small space/time extent. Our\nresults then show that the amount of achievable super-resolution is inversely\nproportional to the object size, and therefore can be significant for small\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 01:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

It is then assumed that the associated probability measure can only be\nused (e.g. sampled) under a discretized approximation. In such scenarios, it is\nknown that to achieve a target error, the computational effort can be reduced\nwhen using MLMC relative to exact sampling from the most accurate discretized\nprobability. The ideas rely upon introducing hierarchies of the discretizations\nwhere less accurate approximations cost less to compute, and using an\nappropriate collapsing sum expression for the target expectation.

We then introduce a new\napproach to prove the generic activated nonlocality as a result of entanglement\nswapping for all bipartite entangled states. The result is further applied to\nshow the multipartite nonlocality and activated nonlocality for all nontrivial\nquantum networks consisting of any entangled states. Our results provide the\nnonlocality witnesses and quantum superiorities of all connected quantum\nnetworks or nontrivial hybrid networks in contrast to classical networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 01:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

STL is based on our proposed\n\\textit{Stratified} distance to capture the local property of domains. STL\nconsists of two components: Stratified Domain Selection (STL-SDS) can select\nthe most similar source domain to the target domain; Stratified Activity\nTransfer (STL-SAT) is able to perform accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive\nexperiments on three public activity recognition datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of STL. Furthermore, we extensively investigate the performance of\ntransfer learning across different degrees of similarities and activity levels\nbetween domains. We also discuss the potential applications of STL in other\nfields of pervasive computing for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 03:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 02:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

This result cannot be obtained in Newtonian dynamics which cannot\nexplain the origin of the BTF and BFJ relations. An alternative, modified\nNewtonian dynamics (MOND) assumes that $G=G_0$ is constant in space and derives\nnaturally a characteristic constant acceleration $a=a_0$, as well as the BTF\nand BFJ relations. This is overkill and it comes with a penalty: MOND cannot\nexplain the origin of $a_0$. A solid physical resolution of this issue is that\n$G \\propto a^{-1}$, which implies that in lower-acceleration environments the\ngravitational force is boosted relative to its Newtonian value because $G$\nincreases. This eliminates all problems related to MOND's empirical cutoff\n$a_0$ and yields a quantitative method for mapping the detailed variations of\n$G(a)$ across each individual galaxy as well as on larger and smaller scales.\nOn the opposite end, the large accelerations produced by $G(a)$ appear to be\nlinked to the weak-field limit of the fourth-order theory of conformal Weyl\ngravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 03:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

The key to numerically solving the GS equation is to enable\nmagnetic field lines smoothly cross the LS, and crossing a straight LS in flat\nspacetime has been a well-studied problem. But the numerical algorithm\nimplementation becomes complicate in the presence of a bent LS, e.g. in curved\nspacetime, since there is no suitable computation grid adapted to it. We\npropose to circumvent this grid-LS mismatch problem by introducing a new\ncoordinate frame designed such that the LS in it is a straight line. As an\napplication, we investigate the general relativistic (GR) effect in\nmagnetosphere structure of rapidly rotating pulsars in detail, where the LS is\nbent towards the central NS. We split the GR effect into two parts, curvature\nand frame-dragging; measure each of them and examine their dependence on the NS\nmass and the angular velocity for pulsars embedded in aligned dipole and\nmultipole magnetic fields. Qualitatively speaking, we find that the curvature\neffect compactifies the magnetic field lines near the NS, therefore reduces the\nopen magnetic flux and the Poynting luminosity, while the frame-dragging effect\ncontributes a minor part in shaping the magnetosphere structure but plays a\nrole in enhancing the spacelike current generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 03:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Five\nvariants of MIRL are considered: uCS-MIRL, advE-MIRL, cooE-MIRL, uCE-MIRL, and\nuNE-MIRL, each distinguished by its solution concept. Problem uCS-MIRL is a\ncooperative game in which the agents employ cooperative strategies that aim to\nmaximize the total game value. In problem uCE-MIRL, agents are assumed to\nfollow strategies that constitute a correlated equilibrium while maximizing\ntotal game value. Problem uNE-MIRL is similar to uCE-MIRL in total game value\nmaximization, but it is assumed that the agents are playing a Nash equilibrium.\nProblems advE-MIRL and cooE-MIRL assume agents are playing an adversarial\nequilibrium and a coordination equilibrium, respectively. We propose novel\napproaches to address these five problems under the assumption that the game\nobserver either knows or is able to accurate estimate the policies and solution\nconcepts for players. For uCS-MIRL, we first develop a characteristic set of\nsolutions ensuring that the observed bi-policy is a uCS and then apply a\nBayesian inverse learning method. For uCE-MIRL, we develop a linear programming\nproblem subject to constraints that define necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the observed policies to be correlated equilibria. The objective is to\nchoose a solution that not only minimizes the total game value difference\nbetween the observed bi-policy and a local uCS, but also maximizes the scale of\nthe solution. We apply a similar treatment to the problem of uNE-MIRL. The\nremaining two problems can be solved efficiently by taking advantage of\nsolution uniqueness and setting up a convex optimization problem.

To\nachieve a good balance between self-sustainability and reliability, partially\nWPSNs with a mixed power solution are desirable for practical applications.\nSpecifically, most of the sensor nodes are wireless powered but the key sensor\nnode adopts traditional wire/battery power for reliability. As a result, this\npaper mainly investigates optimal design for the partially WPSNs in which\nsimultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is adopted in the\ndownlink. Two scenarios with space division multiple access (SDMA) and time\ndivision multiple access (TDMA) in the uplink are considered. For both the\nSDMA-enabled and TDMA-enabled partially WPSNs, joint design of downlink\nbeamforming, uplink beamforming and time allocation is investigated to maximize\nthe uplink sum rate while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (i.e., satisfying\nthe downlink rate constraint) at the key sensor node. After analyzing the\nfeasibility of uplink sum rate maximization problems and the influence of the\ndownlink rate constraint, semi-closed-form optimal solutions for both\nSDMA-enabled and TDMA-enabled WPSNs are proposed with guaranteed global\noptimality. Complexity analysis is also provided to justify the advantage of\nthe proposed solutions in low complexity.

Common\nstrategies are to employ mesh-deformation or re-meshing, where one or the other\ntypically lacks robustness or is computationally expensive. This paper proposes\na different approach, in which the computational domain is represented by\nmultiple, independent meshes. A Nitsche based finite element method is used to\nweakly enforce continuity over the non-matching mesh interfaces. The\noptimization is preformed using an iterative gradient method, in which the\nshape-sensitivities are obtained by employing the Hadamard formulas and the\nadjoint approach. An optimize-then-discretize approach is chosen due to its\nindependence of the FEM framework. Since the individual meshes may be moved\nfreely, re-meshing or mesh deformations can be entirely avoided in cases where\nthe geometry changes consists of rigid motions or scaling. By this free\nmovement, we obtain robust and computational cheap mesh adaptation for\noptimization problems even for large domain changes. For general geometry\nchanges, the method can be combined with mesh-deformation or re-meshing\ntechniques to reduce the amount of deformation required.

Unfortunately, wireless resource scarcity in\nrandom access (RA) is a fundamental bottleneck for enabling massive access. To\naddress this problem, we propose a virtual carrier sensing (VCS) based RA\nscheme in massive MIMO systems. The essence of the proposed scheme lies in\nexploiting wireless spatial resources of uplink channels occupied by assigned\nuser equipments (UEs) to increase channel resources for RA. With the proposed\nscheme, RA UEs are able to exploit the spatial resources that are approximately\northogonal to those of assigned UEs, thus sharing the uplink channel resource\nwith assigned UEs without causing significant interference to them.\nSpecifically, to ensure RA UEs avoid serious interference with assigned UEs,\nbase station (BS) sends tailored virtual carriers to RA UEs on behalf of\nassigned UEs. RA UEs then conduct VCS to determine whether or not the uplink\nchannel resource is available for RA. Closed-form approximations for\nprobability of channel availability and uplink achievable rate with the\nproposed scheme are derived. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show\nthat the proposed scheme is able to significantly increase channel resources of\nRA for massive access.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 08:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

The behaviour is a characteristic of turbulence dominating\nnon-unity Lewis number species transport, and the distinct limit is again\nattributed to dilatation and its effect on the turbulence. Peak local reaction\nrates are found to be lower in the distributed case than in the lower Karlovitz\ncases but higher than in the laminar flame, which is attributed to effects that\narise from the modified fuel-temperature distribution that results from\nturbulent mixing dominating low Lewis number thermodiffusive effects. Finally,\napproaches to achieve distributed burning at realisable conditions are\ndiscussed; factors that increase the likelihood of realising distributed\nburning are higher pressure, lower equivalence ratio, higher Lewis number, and\nlower reactant temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 09:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 11:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 09:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

A straightforward dependence of the mean area\nor $\\bar{u}_T$ on the Kolmogorov velocity, length, and time scales vanishes due\nto the following physical mechanism. At high $Re_L$, turbulent stretching\ncreated by small-scale eddies increases the front area exponentially with time,\nwhereas a volume bounded by the leading and trailing edges of the front grows\nsignificantly slower. Therefore, after a short time, the volume is tightly\nfilled by the front and the mean distance between opposed front elements\nbecomes small with respect to Kolmogorov length scale.

Although image registration is a rather\ngeneral concept specialized methods are usually required to target a specific\nregistration problem.

Also,\nits evaluation has to be performed preferably on a GPU for larger images and\nfor more complex transformation models and regularization terms. This hinders\nresearchers from rapid prototyping and poses hurdles to reproduce research\nresults. There is a clear need for an environment which hides this complexity\nto put the modeling and the experimental exploration of registration methods\ninto the foreground. With the \"Autograd Image Registration Laboratory\"\n(AIRLab), we introduce an open laboratory for image registration tasks, where\nthe analytic gradients of the objective function are computed automatically and\nthe device where the computations are performed, on a CPU or a GPU, is\ntransparent. It is meant as a laboratory for researchers and developers\nenabling them to rapidly try out new ideas for registering images and to\nreproduce registration results which have already been published. AIRLab is\nimplemented in Python using PyTorch as tensor and optimization library and\nSimpleITK for basic image IO.

Without assumptions, large amounts of training data are required\nfor a neural network to learn the full non-linear dynamics without overfitting.\nWe compare different network architectures on one-step prediction and\nsimulation performance and investigate the propensity of different\narchitectures to learn models with correct input-output Jacobian. Furthermore,\nthe influence of $L_2$ weight regularization on the learned Jacobian eigenvalue\nspectrum, and hence system stability, is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 11:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

We adopt the minmax procedure to\ncharacterize the area of overlap between two Gaussian distributions, and\ncompare it with the method of Bhattacharyya distance. We provide closed form\nexpressions that can characterize the overlap as a function of control. Our\nproposed algorithm can avoid overlapping uncertainty distributions in two\npossible ways. Firstly when a prescribed overlapping area that needs to be\navoided is posed as a confidence contour lower bound, control commands are\naccordingly realized through a MPC framework such that these bounds are\nrespected.

We\nhave concentrated on the interplay between the surface induced demixing in the\nadsorbed films and the properties of the bulk mixture, which exhibits a closed\nimmiscibility loop. It has been shown that the wetting behaviour depends on the\nabsolute values of the parameters determining the strengths of interaction\nbetween the mixture components and the surface, as well as on their difference.\nIn general, an increase of the difference between the adsorption energies of\nthe components leads to a decrease of the wetting temperature. In the cases\nwhen the wetting of non-selective walls occurs at the temperatures above the\nonset of demixing transition in the bulk, an increasing wall selectivity leads\nto a gradual decrease of the wetting temperature towards the triple point, in\nwhich the vapour coexists with the mixed and demixed liquid phases. When the\nwetting temperature at the non-selective wall is located below the onset of the\ndemixing transition in the bulk mixture, an increase of the adsorption energy\nof the selected component causes the developing adsorbed films to demix and to\nshow the reentrant mixing upon approaching the bulk coexistence. At the\ntemperatures above the onset of the demixing transition in the bulk, the\nadsorbed films remain demixed up to the bulk coexistence and undergo the\nfirst-order wetting transition.

We find interesting results on interlayer synchronization for a\ncontinuous removal of the interlayer links as well as for progressively created\nstatic nodes. We demonstrate that the mobility parameters responsible for\nintralayer movement of the nodes, can retrieve interlayer synchrony under such\nstructural perturbations. For further analysis of survivability of interlayer\nsynchrony against dynamical perturbations, we proceed through the investigation\nof single-node basin stability, where again the intralayer mobility properties\nhave noticeable impacts.

Here we demonstrate polariton\npopulation from the triplet manifold via triplet-triplet annihilation, leading\nto polariton emission that is longer-lived (>microseconds) even than exciton\nemission in bare films. This enhancement arises from spin-2 triplet-pair\nstates, formed by singlet fission or triplet-triplet annihilation, feeding the\npolariton. This is possible due to state mixing, which -in the strong coupling\nregime- leads to sharing of photonic character with states that are formally\nnon-emissive. Such 'photonic sharing' offers the enticing possibility of\nharvesting or manipulating even states that are formally dark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Image acquisition was performed by three\ndifferent image acquisition protocols using fixed X-ray tube voltages of 81,\n102 and 125 kVp. The images were reconstructed with four different convolution\nkernels, i.e. normal, sharp, soft and very soft. Image quality was assessed in\nterms of high contrast image quality using the modulation transfer function\n(MTF) and low contrast image quality by assessing the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) as well as reliability of density\nmeasurements. Furthermore, the dose intensity profiles parallel and\nperpendicular to the patient support were measured free-in-air.\n  Results: The intensity profile of the CACT measured by the detector system\nfree-in-air showed that the anode heel effect is not in the longitudinal\ndirection to the z-axis. The image noises measured in Setup A for the air and\nbone inserts were systematically higher compared to those measured in Setup B,\nin average about 3% and 4% for the air and bone inserts, respectively.

Given the\nexponential nature of these preferences, compact representations are needed and\n($m$)CP-nets are among the most studied ones. Sequential and global voting are\ntwo ways to aggregate preferences over CP-nets. In the former, preferences are\naggregated feature-by-feature. Hence, when preferences have specific feature\ndependencies, sequential voting may exhibit voting paradoxes, i.e., it might\nselect sub-optimal outcomes. To avoid paradoxes in sequential voting, one has\noften assumed the $\\mathcal{O}$-legality restriction, which imposes a shared\ntopological order among all the CP-nets. On the contrary, in global voting,\nCP-nets are considered as a whole during preference aggregation. For this\nreason, global voting is immune from paradoxes, and there is no need to impose\nrestrictions over the CP-nets' topological structure. Sequential voting over\n$\\mathcal{O}$-legal CP-nets has extensively been investigated. On the other\nhand, global voting over non-$\\mathcal{O}$-legal CP-nets has not carefully been\nanalyzed, despite it was stated in the literature that a theoretical comparison\nbetween global and sequential voting was promising and a precise complexity\nanalysis for global voting has been asked for multiple times.

In three environments from the literature - traffic,\ncommunication, and team coordination - we observe that augmenting MARL with a\nsmall amount of imitation learning greatly increases the probability that the\nstrategy found by MARL fits well with the existing social convention. We show\nthat this works even in an environment where standard training methods very\nrarely find the true convention of the agent's partners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 15:46:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 15:21:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 17:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

Clear decision structure of the\nmedical diagnostics lets us approximate the decision process of a radiologist\nas a model - removed from subjective bias.

All planets that are rocky likely contain some Fe, either within the\ncore or oxidized in the mantle. We argue the true low density end-member for\noxidizing systems is instead a planet with the lowest reasonable Fe/Mg and\ncompletely core-less. Using this logic, we assert that planets b, d and g\nlikely must have significant volatile layers because the end-member planet\nmodels produce masses too high even when uncertainties in both mass and radius\nare taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 15:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-27"}

Progress has been achieved recently in object recognition given\nadvancements in deep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a\nlarge amount of training data and significant manual effort to label objects.\nThis limits their applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a\nlarge number of objects and variety of conditions.

In\nparticular, the proposed framework first generates a labeled dataset for\ntraining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection in clutter.\nThese detections are used to guide a scene-level optimization process, which\nconsiders the interactions between the different objects present in the clutter\nto output pose estimates of high precision. Furthermore, confident estimates\nare used to label online real images from multiple views and re-train the\nprocess in a self-learning pipeline. Experimental results indicate that this\nprocess is quickly able to identify in cluttered scenes physically-consistent\nobject poses that are more precise than the ones found by reasoning over\nindividual instances of objects. Furthermore, the quality of pose estimates\nincreases over time given the self-learning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 20:39:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 19:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

In particular, agricultural\ndata is considered as Big Data in terms of volume, variety, velocity and\nveracity. Designing and developing a data warehouse for precision agriculture\nis a key foundation for establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will\nenable resource efficient agronomy decision making and recommendations. Some of\nthe requirements for such an agricultural data warehouse are privacy, security,\nand real-time access among its stakeholders (e.g., farmers, farm equipment\nmanufacturers, agribusinesses, co-operative societies, customers and possibly\nGovernment agencies). However, currently there are very few reports in the\nliterature that focus on the design of efficient data warehouses with the view\nof enabling Agricultural Big Data analysis and data mining.

Behavioral experiments\nhave been largely conducted to shed light into the mechanisms behind\ncooperation and other behavioral traits. However, most of these experiments\nhave been conducted in laboratories with highly controlled experimental\nprotocols but with varied limitations which limits the reproducibility and the\ngeneralization of the results obtained. In an attempt to overcome these\nlimitations, some experimental approaches have moved human behavior\nexperimentation from laboratories to public spaces, where behaviors occur\nnaturally, and have opened the participation to the general public within the\ncitizen science framework. Given the open nature of these environments, it is\ncritical to establish the appropriate protocols to maintain the same data\nquality that one can obtain in the laboratories. Here, we introduce Citizen\nSocial Lab, a software platform designed to be used in the wild using citizen\nscience practices. The platform allows researchers to collect data in a more\nrealistic context while maintaining the scientific rigour, and it is structured\nin a modular and scalable way so it can also be easily adapted for online or\nbrick-and-mortar experimental laboratories. Following citizen science\nguidelines, the platform is designed to motivate a more general population into\nparticipation, but also to promote engaging and learning of the scientific\nresearch process. We also review the main results of the experiments performed\nusing the platform up to now, and the set of games that each experiment\nincludes. Finally, we evaluate some properties of the platform, such as the\nheterogeneity of the samples of the experiments and their satisfaction level,\nand the parameters that demonstrate the robustness of the platform and the\nquality of the data collected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 12:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

This result has excited the usual healthy skepticism, with questions\nabout whether any untrained peoples can discover the variability and whether\nsuch a discovery is likely to be placed into lore and transmitted for long\nperiods of time. Here, I am offering an independent evaluation, based on broad\nexperience with naked-eye sky viewing and astro-history. I find that it is easy\nfor inexperienced observers to detect the variability of Betelgeuse over its\nrange in brightness from V = 0.0 to V = 1.3, for example in noticing from\nseason-to-season that the star varies from significantly brighter than Procyon\nto being greatly fainter than Procyon. Further, indigenous peoples in the\nSouthern Hemisphere inevitably kept watch on the prominent red star, so it is\ninevitable that the variability of Betelgeuse was discovered many times over\nduring the last 65 millennia. The processes of placing this discovery into a\ncultural context (in this case, put into morality stories) and the faithful\ntransmission for many millennia is confidently known for the Aboriginal\nAustralians in particular. So this shows that the whole claim for a changing\nBetelgeuse in the Aboriginal Australian lore is both plausible and likely.\nGiven that the discovery and transmission is easily possible, the real proof is\nthat the Aboriginal lore gives an unambiguous statement that these stars do\nindeed vary in brightness, as collected by many ethnographers over a century\nago from many Aboriginal groups. So I strongly conclude that the Aboriginal\nAustralians could and did discover the variability of Betelgeuse, Aldebaran,\nand Antares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 11:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}
