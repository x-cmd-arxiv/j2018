Pulse\nprofiles measured over the combined 0.2-100 keV range show complex evolution\nthat is both luminosity and energy dependent. Near the critical luminosity of\nL~1E+38 erg/s, the pulse profiles transition from single-peaked to double\npeaked, the pulsed fraction reaches a minimum in all energy bands, and the\nhardness ratios in both NICER and GBM show a turn-over to softening as the\nintensity increases.

It is usually\nformulated in terms of Langevin equations, giving rise to a Fokker-Planck\nequation for the probability distribution function of the fields, and possibly\ntheir momenta. The link between these two descriptions is ambiguous in general,\nas it depends on an implicit discretisation procedure, the two prominent ones\nbeing the It\\^o and Stratonovich prescriptions. Here we show that the\nrequirement of general covariance under field redefinitions is verified only in\nthe latter case, however at the expense of introducing spurious `frame'\ndependences. This stochastic anomaly disappears when there is only one source\nof stochasticity, like in slow-roll single-field inflation, but manifests\nitself when taking into account the full phase space, or in the presence of\nmultiple fields. Despite these difficulties, we use physical arguments to write\ndown a covariant Fokker-Planck equation that describes the diffusion of light\nscalar fields in non-linear sigma models in the overdamped limit. We apply it\nto test scalar fields in de Sitter space and show that some statistical\nproperties of a class of two-field models with derivative interactions can be\nreproduced by using a correspondence with a single-field model endowed with an\neffective potential. We also present explicit results in a simple extension of\nthe single-field $\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory to a hyperbolic field space geometry.\nThe difficulties we describe seem to be the stochastic counterparts of the\nnotoriously difficult problem of maintaining general covariance in quantum\ntheories, and the related choices of operator ordering and path-integral\nconstructions.

The selection of heroes, also known as pick or draft,\ntakes place before the match starts and alternates between the two teams until\neach player has selected one hero.

Indisputably, this is a key technique in\nparameterized algorithms and modern algorithm design. Despite the enormous\nimpact of this approach in theory, it still has very little influence on\npractical implementations. The reasons for this phenomenon are manifold. One of\nthem is the simple fact that such an implementation requires a long chain of\nnon-trivial tasks (as computing the decomposition, preparing it,...). We\nprovide an easy way to implement such dynamic programs that only requires the\ndefinition of the update rules. With this interface, dynamic programs for\nvarious problems, such as 3-coloring, can be implemented easily in about 100\nlines of structured Java code.\n  The theoretical foundation of the success of dynamic programming on tree\ndecompositions is well understood due to Courcelle's celebrated theorem, which\nstates that every MSO-definable problem can be efficiently solved if a tree\ndecomposition of small width is given. We seek to provide practical access to\nthis theorem as well, by presenting a lightweight model-checker for a small\nfragment of MSO. This fragment is powerful enough to describe many natural\nproblems, and our model-checker turns out to be very competitive against\nsimilar state-of-the-art tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 19:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

However, carefully\nexamining its detailed formulation reveals that the traditional identification\nof logically reversible computational operations with bijective transformations\nof the full digital state space is actually not the correct logical-level\ncharacterization of the full set of classical computational operations that can\nbe carried out physically with asymptotically zero energy dissipation. To find\nthe correct logical conditions for physical reversibility, we must account for\ninitial-state probabilities when applying the Principle. The minimal\nlogical-level requirement for the physical reversibility of deterministic\ncomputational operations is that the subset of initial states that exhibit\nnonzero probability in a given statistical operating context must be\ntransformed one-to-one into final states. Thus, any computational operation is\nconditionally reversible relative to any sufficiently-restrictive precondition\non its initial state, and the minimum dissipation required for any\ndeterministic operation by Landauer's Principle asymptotically approaches 0\nwhen the probability of meeting any preselected one of its suitable\npreconditions approaches 1. This realization facilitates simpler designs for\nasymptotically thermodynamically reversible computational hardware, compared to\ndesigns that are restricted to using only fully-bijective operations such as\nToffoli type operations. Thus, this more general framework for reversible\ncomputing provides a more effective theoretical foundation to use for the\ndesign of practical reversible computers than does the more restrictive\ntraditional model of reversible logic.

This includes common\ninput devices, such as keyboards, that are used for entering (among other\nthings) secret information, such as passwords and PINs. Although thermal\nresidue dissipates over time, there is always a certain time window during\nwhich thermal energy readings can be harvested from input devices to recover\nrecently entered, and potentially sensitive, information. To-date, there has\nbeen no systematic investigation of thermal profiles of keyboards, and thus no\nefforts have been made to secure them. This serves as our main motivation for\nconstructing a means for password harvesting from keyboard thermal emanations.\nSpecifically, we introduce Thermanator, a new post factum insider attack based\non heat transfer caused by a user typing a password on a typical external\nkeyboard. We conduct and describe a user study that collected thermal residues\nfrom 30 users entering 10 unique passwords (both weak and strong) on 4 popular\ncommodity keyboards. Results show that entire sets of key-presses can be\nrecovered by non-expert users as late as 30 seconds after initial password\nentry, while partial sets can be recovered as late as 1 minute after entry.\nFurthermore, we find that Hunt-and-Peck typists are particularly vulnerable. We\nalso discuss some Thermanator mitigation strategies. The main take-away of this\nwork is three-fold: (1) using external keyboards to enter (already\nmuch-maligned) passwords is even less secure than previously recognized, (2)\npost factum (planned or impromptu) thermal imaging attacks are realistic, and\nfinally (3) perhaps it is time to either stop using keyboards for password\nentry, or abandon passwords altogether.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 19:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 19:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

However, it remains unclear how the clustering\ncoefficient should be measured in a correlation-based network, which is among\nmajor representations of brain networks. In the present article, we propose\nclustering coefficients tailored to correlation matrices. The key idea is to\nuse three-way partial correlation or partial mutual information to measure the\nstrength of the association between the two neighbouring nodes of a focal node\nrelative to the amount of pseudo-correlation expected from indirect paths\nbetween the nodes. Our method avoids the difficulties of previous applications\nof clustering coefficient (and other) measures in defining correlational\nnetworks, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value, discarding of negative\ncorrelation values, the pseudo-correlation problem and full partial correlation\nmatrices whose estimation is computationally difficult. For proof of concept,\nwe apply the proposed clustering coefficient measures to functional magnetic\nresonance imaging data obtained from healthy participants of various ages and\ncompare them with conventional clustering coefficients. We show that the\nclustering coefficients decline with the age. The proposed clustering\ncoefficients are more strongly correlated with age than the conventional ones\nare.

This multiplexing scheme however suffers from the high\npeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which can considerably impact the energy\nefficiency, size and cost of PLC modems as well as cause electromagnetic\ncompatibility (EMC) issues. This paper investigates the performance of vector\nOFDM (VOFDM), which has inherently better PAPR properties, over non-Gaussian\nbroadband PLC channels equipped with two nonlinear preprocessors at the\nreceiver. In addition, the low PAPR property of the VOFDM system is exploited\nto further enhance the efficiency of the nonlinear preprocessors. The\nachievable gains are studied in terms of the complementary cumulative\ndistribution function of the PAPR, probability of noise detection error and the\nsignal-to-noise ratio at the output of the nonlinear preprocessors. For\ncomparison's sake, the performance of conventional OFDM systems is also\npresented throughout the paper. Results reveal that the proposed system is able\nto provide up to 2 dB saving in the transmit power relative to the conventional\nOFDM under same system conditions, which eventually also translates into a\nsystem that is more resilient to EMC limits, reduced cost and size of PLC\nmodems. It is also shown that the achievable gains become more significant as\nthe vector block (VB) size of the VOFDM system is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 23:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Background fields provide information about the\nspectra and intensities of the neutrinos scattered into each ray. These\nbackground fields may be taken from a low-order moment simulation or be\nignored, in which case the method reduces to a standard state-of-the-art ray\ntracing formulation. The method handles radiation in regimes spanning optically\nthick to optically thin. We test the new code, highlight its strengths and\nweaknesses, and apply it to a simulation of a neutron star merger to compute\nneutrino fluxes and spectra, and to demonstrate a neutrino flavor oscillation\ncalculation.

As a result, saliency model benchmarking often\nrequires several evaluation metrics to simultaneously assess saliency models\nfrom multiple perspectives. However, most computational metrics are not\ndesigned to directly measure the perceptual similarity of saliency maps so that\nthe evaluation results may be sometimes inconsistent with the subjective\nimpression. To address this problem, this paper first conducts extensive\nsubjective tests to find out how the visual similarities between saliency maps\nare perceived by humans. Based on the crowdsourced data collected in these\ntests, we conclude several key factors in assessing saliency maps and quantize\nthe performance of existing metrics. Inspired by these factors, we propose to\nlearn a saliency evaluation metric based on a two-stream convolutional neural\nnetwork using crowdsourced perceptual judgements. Specifically, the relative\nsaliency score of each pair from the crowdsourced data is utilized to\nregularize the network during the training process. By capturing the key\nfactors shared by various subjects in comparing saliency maps, the learned\nmetric better aligns with human perception of saliency maps, making it a good\ncomplement to the existing metrics. Experimental results validate that the\nlearned metric can be generalized to the comparisons of saliency maps from new\nimages, new datasets, new models and synthetic data. Due to the effectiveness\nof the learned metric, it also can be used to facilitate the development of new\nmodels for fixation prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 00:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

In this paper, we propose a large-scale\ndataset with 500 aerial videos and manually annotated primary objects. To the\nbest of our knowledge, it is the largest dataset to date for primary object\nsegmentation in aerial videos. From this dataset, we find most aerial videos\ncontain large-scale scenes, small primary objects as well as consistently\nvarying scales and viewpoints. Inspired by that, we propose a hierarchical deep\nco-segmentation approach that repeatedly divides a video into two sub-videos\nformed by the odd and even frames, respectively. In this manner, the primary\nobjects shared by sub-videos can be co-segmented by training two-stream CNNs\nand finally refined within the neighborhood reversible flows. Experimental\nresults show that our approach remarkably outperforms 17 state-of-the-art\nmethods in segmenting primary objects in various types of aerial videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 02:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 07:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

The survey covers a total area of 1.01\nsquare degrees with rms depths of 0.52 - 1.44 mJy and detects 728 sources above\n3sigma. We find overdensities of a factor of ~2 in the source counts of 3\nindividual fields (4C+23.56, PKS1138-262 and MRC0355-037) over areas of ~200 sq\ndeg. When combining all fields, the source-count analysis finds an overdensity\nthat reaches a factor $\\gtrsim 3$ at S$_{\\rm{1.1mm}} \\ge 4$ mJy covering a\n1.5-arcmin-radius area centred on the AGN. The large size of our maps allows us\nto establish that beyond a radius of 1.5 arcmin, the radial surface density of\nSMGs falls to that of a blank field. In addition, we find a trend for SMGs to\nalign closely to a perpendicular direction with respect to the radio jets of\nthe powerful central radio galaxies (73$_{+13}^{-14}$ degrees). This\nmisalignment is found over projected co-moving scales of 4-20 Mpc, departs from\nperfect alignment (0 deg) by ~5sigma, and apparently has no dependence on SMG\nluminosity. Under the assumption that the AzTEC sources are at the redshift of\nthe central radio galaxy, the misalignment reported here can be interpreted as\nSMGs preferentially inhabiting mass-dominant filaments funneling material\ntowards the protoclusters, which are also the parent structures of the radio\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 04:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Our approach differs from other recent work on self-supervised\nstructure-from-motion in its use of a continuous motion formulation and\nrepresentation of rigid motion fields rather than direct prediction of camera\nparameters. To make estimation robust in dynamic environments with multiple\nmoving objects, we introduce a simple two-component segmentation process that\nisolates the rigid background environment from dynamic scene elements.

Designing\nand training a well-performing model is generally expensive. However, when\nreleasing them, attackers may reverse engineer the models and pirate their\ndesign. This paper, therefore, proposes deep learning obfuscation, aiming at\nobstructing attackers from pirating a deep learning model. In particular, we\nfocus on obfuscating convolutional neural networks (CNN), a widely employed\ntype of deep learning architectures for image recognition. Our approach\nobfuscates a CNN model eventually by simulating its feature extractor with a\nshallow and sequential convolutional block. To this end, we employ a recursive\nsimulation method and a joint training method to train the simulation network.\nThe joint training method leverages both the intermediate knowledge generated\nby a feature extractor and data labels to train a simulation network. In this\nway, we can obtain an obfuscated model without accuracy loss. We have verified\nthe feasibility of our approach with three prevalent CNNs, i.e., GoogLeNet,\nResNet, and DenseNet. Although these networks are very deep with tens or\nhundreds of layers, we can simulate them in a shallow network including only\nfive or seven convolutional layers. The obfuscated models are even more\nefficient than the original models. Our obfuscation approach is very effective\nto protect the critical structure of a deep learning model from being exposed\nto attackers. Moreover, it can also thwart attackers from pirating the model\nwith transfer learning or incremental learning techniques because the shallow\nsimulation network bears poor learning ability.

Recently, the simplest member of\nthis chemical family, cyanogen (NCCN), was indirectly probed for the first time\nin interstellar space through the detection of its protonated form toward the\ndense clouds L483 and TMC-1. Here we present a second firm evidence of the\npresence of NCCN in interstellar space, namely the detection of the metastable\nand polar isomer isocyanogen (CNCN). This species has been identified in L483\nand tentatively in TMC-1 by observing various rotational transitions in the 3\nmm band with the IRAM 30m telescope. We derive beam-averaged column densities\nfor CNCN of 1.6e12 cm-2 in L483 and 9e11 cm-2 in TMC-1, which imply fractional\nabundances relative to H2 in the range (5-9)e-11. While the presence of NCCN in\ninterstellar clouds seems out of doubt owing to the detection of NCCNH+ and\nCNCN, putting tight constraints on its abundance is still hampered by the poor\nknowledge of the chemistry that links NCCN with NCCNH+ and especially with\nCNCN.

In this paper we discuss the (quasi) de Sitter instability from\ngravitational backreaction involving quantum conformal anomaly. The conformal\nor trace anomaly corresponds to the quantum gravitational contributions of the\nmassless conformal fields and affects the spacetime homogeneously. First, we\nderive the conformal anomaly using the adiabatic (WKB) approximation and\ndiscuss the renormalization of the quantum energy momentum tensor. Then, we\nconsider the dynamics of the Hubble parameter based on the semiclassical\nEinstein's equations including the cosmological constant, the conformal anomaly\nand the higher-derivative terms.

Based on our recent\n\\textit{ab-initio} calculations, we analyze the feasibility of all-optical\nschemes for the formation of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$^{84}$Sr bosonic molecules.\nFirst, we have studied the formation by photoassociation followed by\nspontaneous emission. The photoassociation rates to levels belonging to\nelectronic states converging to the\n$^{87}$Rb$(5s\\,^2S)$+$^{84}$Sr($5s5p\\,^3P_{0,1,2}$) asymptotes are particularly\nsmall close to the asymptote.

The relaxation from the levels close to the asymptotes creates\nweakly-bound molecules in mosty only one vibrational level. Second, stimulated\nRaman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) achieved in a tight optical trap efficiently\ncreates weakly-bound ground-state molecules in a well-defined level, thus\nproviding an alternative to magnetic Feshbach resonances to implement several\nschemes for an adiabatic population transfer toward the lowest ground-state\nlevel of RbSr. Finally, we have studied STIRAP process for transferring the\nweakly-bound molecules into the $v''=0$ level of the RbSr ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 08:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

One motivation is to find\na consistent unification of quantum theory and gravity, in which collapse\nprevents superpositions of space-times from developing. Another is to invoke\ncollapse to explain our perception of definite measurement outcomes. Combining\nthese motivations while avoiding two different collapse postulates seems to\nrequire that perceptibly different physical states necessarily create\nsignificantly different mass distributions in our organs of perception or\nbrains. Bassi et al. investigated this question in the context of mass density\ndependent spontaneous collapse models. By analysing the mechanism of visual\nperception of a few photons in the human eye, they argued that collapse model\nparameters consistent with known experiment imply that a collapse would take\nplace in the eye within the human perception time of ~100ms, so that a definite\nstate of observing some or no photons would be created from an initial\nsuperposition. I reanalyse their arguments, and note a key problem: they treat\nthe relevant processes as though they take place in vacuo, rather than in\ncytoplasm. This makes a significant difference, since the models imply that\nsuperpositions collapse at rates that depend on the difference between the\ncoarse grained mass densities of their components. This increases the required\ncollapse rate, most likely by at least an order of magnitude and plausibly by\nsignificantly more. This casts some doubt on the claim that there are collapse\nmodel parameters consistent with known experiment that imply collapse times of\n<~ 100ms within the human eye.

In this paper we present a multineuronal spike pattern\ndetection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and\nrecognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to\ndifferent neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure\nis based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike\nlatency, that enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and\nheterosynaptic plasticity, that allows the own regulation of synaptic weights.\nFrom the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows\nmapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multidimensional, temporal, feature\nspace. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron\nfires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be\nconsidered to span a single temporal axis.

At each time period, the seller offers an arriving\ncustomer an assortment of substitutable products and the customer makes the\npurchase among offered products according to a discrete choice model. The goal\nof the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or equivalently, to minimize\nthe worst-case expected regret. One key challenge is that utilities of products\nare unknown to the seller and need to be learned. Although the dynamic\nassortment planning problem has received increasing attention in revenue\nmanagement, most existing work is based on the multinomial logit choice models\n(MNL). In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic assortment planning under\na more general choice model -- the nested logit model, which models\nhierarchical choice behavior and is ``the most widely used member of the GEV\n(generalized extreme value) family''. By leveraging the revenue-ordered\nstructure of the optimal assortment within each nest, we develop a novel upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) policy with an aggregated estimation scheme. Our policy\nsimultaneously learns customers' choice behavior and makes dynamic decisions on\nassortments based on the current knowledge. It achieves the accumulated regret\nat the order of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{MNT})$, where $M$ is the number of nests and\n$N$ is the number of products in each nest. We further provide a lower bound\nresult of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{MT})$, which shows the near optimality of the upper\nbound when $T$ is much larger than $M$ and $N$. When the number of items per\nnest $N$ is large, we further provide a discretization heuristic for better\nperformance of our algorithm.

MTBI is a growing public health\nproblem with an estimated incidence of over 1.7 million people annually in US.\nDiagnosis is based on clinical history and symptoms, and accurate, concrete\nmeasures of injury are lacking. Unlike most of previous works, which use\nhand-crafted features extracted from different parts of brain for MTBI\nclassification, we employ feature learning algorithms to learn more\ndiscriminative representation for this task. A major challenge in this field\nthus far is the relatively small number of subjects available for training.\nThis makes it difficult to use an end-to-end convolutional neural network to\ndirectly classify a subject from MR images. To overcome this challenge, we\nfirst apply an adversarial auto-encoder (with convolutional structure) to learn\npatch-level features, from overlapping image patches extracted from different\nbrain regions. We then aggregate these features through a bag-of-word approach.\nWe perform an extensive experimental study on a dataset of 227 subjects\n(including 109 MTBI patients, and 118 age and sex matched healthy controls),\nand compare the bag-of-deep-features with several previous approaches.

Nonetheless, in\ntime-changing situations the brain exploits specific processing mechanisms for\ntemporal information based on prediction and anticipation, as time compression\nduring visual perception and mental navigation. Alternative hypothesis of time\ncompaction integrates both views, postulating that dynamic situations are\ninternally represented as static spatial maps where temporal information is\nextracted by predicting and structuring the relevant interactions.\nNevertheless, empirical approaches tackling the biological soundness of time\ncompaction are still lacking.

The thesis is divided in four independent\nchapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's\ndissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic\nsetting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a\nstationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and\non the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the\nKolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in\nthe form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.\nKolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of\nstatistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research\narea consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the\nNavier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion\nand in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the\npurpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the\nNavier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for\nthe study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition\nand then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the\nNavier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of\nthese damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation\nrate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are\ninterested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes\nintroduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular\ntype of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study\nis motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations\nwith a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of\nthe stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these\nsolutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then\nall non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal\nvariables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns\nthe decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of\nstationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the\nNavier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary\nsolutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical\nequations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is\nto study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the\nturbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according\nto the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency\ndecay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent\nsetting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs\nfrequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a\nprecise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in\nthe turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the\nstationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the\nuniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external\nforce. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these\nsolutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a\ngeneral framework of Morrey spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 12:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 09:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

Here, we propose a class of\nmaterials which are termed as quadratic contact point (QCP) semimetals. In\nthese materials, the conduction and valence bands contact at isolated points in\nthe Brillouin zone, around which the band dispersions are quadratic along all\nthree directions. We show that in the absence/presence of spin-orbit coupling,\nthere may exist triply/quadruply-degenerate QCPs that are protected by the\ncrystalline symmetry. We construct effective models to characterize the\nlow-energy fermions near these QCPs.

The short time scales over which these quantities\nvary, the size of the variations, and the close correlation between scattering\nand dispersion measure all suggest that the effects are due to discrete\nstructures within the Crab Nebula, with size scales of $\\sim6$ AU\n(corresponding to an angular size of $\\sim2$ mas at an assumed distance of 2200\npc). We mitigate the effects of scattering on the observed pulse shape by using\nthe measured scattering information to modify the template used for generating\nthe pulse arrival times, thus improving the precision to which the pulsar can\nbe timed. We test this on timing data taken during periods of high scattering,\nand obtain a factor of two improvement in the root mean square of the timing\nresiduals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 13:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

The two\nmodels have different scalings for the boundary latitude and zonal wind.\nNumerical simulations are found to have smoother temperature profiles than\neither model, with no temperature or velocity discontinuities even in zonally\nsymmetric simulations. Continuity is achieved because of the presence of an\noverturning circulation poleward of the point of maximum zonal wind, which\nallows the zonal velocity profile to be smoother than the original theory\nwithout the temperature discontinuities of the variant theory.

The current study examined a\nmechanism that relates the effects of Coriolis acceleration, spanwise flow, and\nthe tilting of the planetary vortex on limiting the growth of the LEV.\nSpecifically, this mechanism states that a vertical gradient in spanwise flow\ncan create a vertical gradient in Coriolis acceleration, which will in turn\nproduce oppositely-signed vorticity within the LEV. This gradient of Coriolis\nacceleration corresponds to the spanwise (radial) component of planetary vortex\ntilting (PVTr) that reorients the planetary vortex into the spanwise direction\ntherefore creating oppositely-signed LEV vorticity.

Its use is\nhowever still limited because of the required cold-atom laser-cooling\ntechniques. Here we present a compact ultracold electron source based on a\ngrating magneto-optical trap (GMOT), which only requires one trapping laser\nbeam that passes through a transparent accelerator module. This makes the\ntechnique more widely accessible and increases its applicability. We show the\nGMOT can be operated with a hole in the center of the grating and with large\nelectric fields applied across the trapping region, which is required for\nextracting electron bunches. The calculated values of the applied electric\nfield were found to agree well with measured Stark shifts of the laser cooling\ntransition. The electron beams extracted from the GMOT have been characterised.\nBeam energies up to 10 keV were measured using a time-of-flight method.

Atomic diffusion by gravitational\nsettling nowadays is usually taken into account, and is essential for\nhelioseismic studies. On the other hand, radiative accelerations are rarely\naccounted for, act differently on the various chemical elements, and can\nstrongly counteract gravity in some stellar mass domains. In this study we aim\nat determining whether radiative accelerations impact the structure of\nsolar-like oscillating main-sequence stars observed by asteroseismic space\nmissions. We implemented the calculation of radiative accelerations in the\nCESTAM code using the Single-Valued Parameter method. We built and compared\nseveral grids of stellar models including gravitational settling, but some with\nand others without radiative accelerations. We found that radiative\naccelerations may not be neglected for stellar masses larger than\n1.1~M$_{\\odot}$ at solar metallicity. The difference in age due to their\ninclusion in models can reach 9\\% for the more massive stars of our grids. We\nestimated that the percentage of the PLATO core program stars whose modelling\nwould require radiative accelerations ranges between 33 and 58\\% depending on\nthe precision of the seismic data. We conclude that, in the context of Kepler,\nTESS, and PLATO missions, which provide (or will provide) high quality seismic\ndata, radiative accelerations can have a significant effect when inferring the\nproperties of solar-like oscillators properly. This is particularly important\nfor age inferences.

This problem is an instance of record linkage problem and\nis a challenging problem because people do not consistently use the official\nname, but use abbreviations, synonyms, different order of terms, different\nspelling of terms, short form of terms, and the name can contain typos or\nspacing issues. We provide a probabilistic model using relational logistic\nregression to find the probability of each record in the database being the\ndesired record for a given query and find the best record(s) with respect to\nthe probabilities. Building on term-matching and translational approaches for\nsearch, our model addresses many of the aforementioned challenges and provides\ngood results when existing baselines fail.

In this\npaper, a simple decomposition-based MOEA with local iterative update (LIU) is\nproposed. The LIU strategy has two features that are expected to drive the\npopulation to approximate the Pareto Front with good distribution. One is that\nonly the worst solution in the current neighborhood is swapped out by the newly\ngenerated offspring, preventing the population from being occupied by copies of\na few individuals. The other is that its iterative process helps to assign\nbetter solutions to subproblems, which is beneficial to make full use of the\nsimilarity of solutions to neighboring subproblems and explore local areas in\nthe search space. In addition, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is\nthe same as that of MOEA/D, and lower than that of other known MOEAs, since it\nconsiders only individuals within the current neighborhood at each update. The\nalgorithm is compared with several of the best MOEAs on problems chosen from\ntwo famous test suites DTLZ and WFG. Experimental results demonstrate that only\na handful of running instances of the algorithm on DTLZ4 lose their population\ndiversity. What's more, the algorithm wins in most of the test instances in\nterms of both running time and solution quality, indicating that it is very\neffective in solving MaOPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 01:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

Finally, the\nmental operations of image comparison and their scaling are defined in a way\nallowing for the bounded capacity of human cognition. As demonstrated, the\ndeveloped theory of stimulus perception is able to explain the basic\nregularities of psychophysics, e.g., (i) the regression and range effects\nleading to the overestimation of weak stimuli and the underestimation of strong\nstimuli, (ii) scalar variability (Weber's and Ekman' laws), and (\\textit{iii})\nthe sequential (memory) effects. As the final result, a solution to the\nFechner-Stevens dilemma is proposed. This solution posits that Fechner's\nlogarithmic law is not a consequences of Weber's law but stems from the\ninterplay of uncertainty in evaluating stimulus intensities and the multi-step\nscaling required to overcome the stimulus incommensurability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 11:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

What can computation compute? How many steps does a\ncomputation require to solve an instance of the 3-SAT problem? Our work\naddresses the first question, by introducing a new model called the ex-machine.\nThe ex-machine executes Turing machine instructions and two special types of\ninstructions. Quantum random instructions are physically realizable with a\nquantum random number generator. Meta instructions can add new states and add\nnew instructions to the ex-machine. A countable set of ex-machines is\nconstructed, each with a finite number of states and instructions; each\nex-machine can compute a Turing incomputable language, whenever the quantum\nrandomness measurements behave like unbiased Bernoulli trials. In 1936, Alan\nTuring posed the halting problem for Turing machines and proved that this\nproblem is unsolvable for Turing machines. Consider an enumeration E_a(i) =\n(M_i, T_i) of all Turing machines M_i and initial tapes T_i. Does there exist\nan ex-machine X that has at least one evolutionary path X --> X_1 --> X_2 --> .\n. . --> X_m, so at the mth stage ex-machine X_m can correctly determine for 0\n<= i <= m whether M_i's execution on tape T_i eventually halts? We demonstrate\nan ex-machine Q(x) that has one such evolutionary path. The existence of this\nevolutionary path suggests that David Hilbert was not misguided to propose in\n1900 that mathematicians search for finite processes to help construct\nmathematical proofs. Our refinement is that we cannot use a fixed computer\nprogram that behaves according to a fixed set of mechanical rules.
