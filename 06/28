Efficient and accurate computations allow for simulations on large\ncomputational domains in three spatial dimensions (3D) and for long\ncomputational times.

While most of the previous analytical studies in this context\nassume that the radial turbulent coefficient is equal to the vertical dust\ndiffusion coefficient, in the light of the results of recent numerical\nsimulations, we relax this assumption by adopting effective parametrisations of\nthe turbulent coefficients involved in terms of the strength of the magnetic\nfields driving the wind. Theoretical studies have already pointed out that even\nin the absence of winds, these coefficients are not necessarily equal, though\nits consequences regarding pebble production have not been explored. In this\npaper, we investigate the evolution of the pebble production line, the radial\nmass flux of the pebbles and their corresponding surface density as a function\nof the plasma parameter at the disk midplane. Our analysis explicitly\ndemonstrates that the presence of magnetically-driven winds in a PPD leads to\nconsiderable reduction of the rate and duration of the pebble delivery. We show\nthat when the wind is strong, the core growth in mass due to the pebble\naccretion is so slow that it is unlikely that a core could reach a pebble\nisolation mass during a PPD lifetime. When the mass of a core reaches this\ncritical value, pebble accretion is halted due to core-driven perturbations in\nthe gas. With decreasing wind strength, however, pebble accretion may, in a\nshorter time, increase the mass of a core to the pebble isolation mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 17:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Yet its complexity for systems subject to the white noise remains\nsignificant. The issue appears due to the fact that the random increments\ngenerated by the Brownian motion, result in a growing set of random variables\nwith respect to which the process could be measured. In order to cope with this\nhigh dimensionality, we present a novel transformation of stochastic processes\ndriven by the white noise. In particular, we show that under suitable\nassumptions, the diffusion arising from white noise can be cast into a\nlogarithmic gradient induced by the measure of the process. Through this\ntransformation, the resulting equation describes a stochastic process whose\nrandomness depends only upon the initial condition. Therefore the stochasticity\nof the transformed system lives in the initial condition and thereby it can be\ntreated conveniently with the chaos expansion tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 17:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

This family of discrete distributions is\nvery wide and embraces Poisson distributions, negative binomial distributions,\nSichel distributions, Weibull--Poisson distributions and many other types of\ndistributions supplying descriptive statistics with many flexible models. These\ndistributions seem to be very promising for the statistical description of many\nreal phenomena. GG distributions are widely applied in signal and image\nprocessing and other practical problems. The statistical estimation of the\nparameters of GNB and GG distributions is quite complicated.

This approach, first,\nallows to obtain parameter estimates without using grid methods and solving\nsystems of nonlinear equations and, second, yields not point estimates as the\nmethods of moments or maximum likelihood do, but the estimate for the density\nfunction.

The\ntheoretical work of Arora et al. suggests a dilemma about GANs' statistical\nproperties: powerful discriminators cause overfitting, whereas weak\ndiscriminators cannot detect mode collapse.\n  By contrast, we show in this paper that GANs can in principle learn\ndistributions in Wasserstein distance (or KL-divergence in many cases) with\npolynomial sample complexity, if the discriminator class has strong\ndistinguishing power against the particular generator class (instead of against\nall possible generators). For various generator classes such as mixture of\nGaussians, exponential families, and invertible and injective neural networks\ngenerators, we design corresponding discriminators (which are often neural nets\nof specific architectures) such that the Integral Probability Metric (IPM)\ninduced by the discriminators can provably approximate the Wasserstein distance\nand/or KL-divergence. This implies that if the training is successful, then the\nlearned distribution is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance\nor KL divergence, and thus cannot drop modes. Our preliminary experiments show\nthat on synthetic datasets the test IPM is well correlated with KL divergence\nor the Wasserstein distance, indicating that the lack of diversity in GANs may\nbe caused by the sub-optimality in optimization instead of statistical\ninefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 17:33:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 06:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 06:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 05:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Tremendous effort has been\ndedicated over the past decades to measure $H_0$. Notably, Planck cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) and the local Cepheid-supernovae distance ladder\nmeasurements determine $H_0$ with a precision of $\\sim 1\\%$ and $\\sim 2\\%$\nrespectively. A $3$-$\\sigma$ level of discrepancy exists between the two\nmeasurements, for reasons that have yet to be understood. Gravitational wave\n(GW) sources accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts offer a\ncompletely independent standard siren (the GW analogue of an astronomical\nstandard candle) measurement of $H_0$, as demonstrated following the discovery\nof the neutron star merger, GW170817. This measurement does not assume a\ncosmological model and is independent of a cosmic distance ladder. The first\njoint analysis of the GW signal from GW170817 and its EM localization led to a\nmeasurement of $H_0=74^{+16}_{-8}$ km/s/Mpc (median and symmetric $68\\%$\ncredible interval).

The nature of the IMF (is it\na probability density or an optimal sampling distribution function?) is raised.\nBinary stars, if unresolved, have a very significant influence at low stellar\nmasses. Especially important is to take care of the changing binary fraction as\na result of stellar-dynamical evolution of the embedded clusters which spawn\nthe field populations of galaxies, given that the binary fraction at birth is\nvery high and independent of primary-star mass. The high multiplicity fraction\namongst massive stars leads to a substantial fraction of these being ejected\nout of their birth clusters and to massive stars merging. This explains the\ntop-lightness of the IMF in star clusters in M31. In close binaries also the\nmasses of the components can be changed due to mass transfer.

Scalar field dynamics dictate that the field is initially\nfrozen and then begins to oscillate around its minimum when the Hubble\nparameter drops below some critical value. For $n\\!=\\!1$, once dynamical, the\naxion energy density dilutes as matter; for $n\\!=\\!2$ it dilutes as radiation\nand for $n\\!=\\!3$ it dilutes faster than radiation. Both the homogeneous\nevolution of the ULA and the dynamics of its linear perturbations are included,\nusing an effective fluid approximation generalized from the usual $n=1$ case.\nULA models are parameterized by the redshift $z_c$ when the field becomes\ndynamical, the fractional energy density $f_{z_c} \\equiv\n\\Omega_a(z_c)/\\Omega_{\\rm tot}(z_c)$ in the axion field at $z_c$, and the\neffective sound speed $c_s^2$. Using Planck, BAO and JLA data, constraints on\n$f_{z_c}$ are obtained. ULAs are degenerate with dark energy for all three\npotentials if $1+z_c \\lesssim 10$. When $3\\times10^4 \\gtrsim 1+z_c \\gtrsim 10\n$, $f_{z_c}$ is constrained to be $ \\lesssim 0.004 $ for $n=1$ and $f_{z_c}\n\\lesssim 0.02 $ for the other two potentials. The constraints then relax with\nincreasing $z_c$. These results strongly constrain ULAs as a resolution to\ncosmological tensions, such as discrepant measurements of the Hubble constant,\nor the EDGES measurement of the global 21 cm signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

However, atoms can be\nused to mediate photonic interactions, raising the prospect of forming\nsynthetic materials and quantum information systems from photons. One promising\napproach uses electromagnetically-induced transparency with highly-excited\nRydberg atoms to generate strong photonic interactions. Adding an optical\ncavity shapes the available modes and forms strongly-interacting polaritons\nwith enhanced light-matter coupling. However, since every atom of the same\nspecies is identical, the atomic transitions available are only those\nprescribed by nature. This inflexibility severely limits their utility for\nmediating the formation of photonic materials in cavities, as the resonator\nmode spectrum is typically poorly matched to the atomic spectrum. Here we use\nFloquet engineering to redesign the spectrum of Rubidium and make it compatible\nwith the spectrum of a cavity, in order to explore strongly interacting\npolaritons in a customized space. We show that periodically modulating the\nenergy of an atomic level redistributes its spectral weight into\nlifetime-limited bands separated by multiples of the modulation frequency.\nSimultaneously generating bands resonant with two chosen spatial modes of an\noptical cavity supports \"Floquet polaritons\" in both modes. In the presence of\nRydberg dressing, we find that these polaritons interact strongly. Floquet\npolaritons thus provide a promising new path to quantum information\ntechnologies such as multimode photon-by-photon switching, as well as to\nordered states of strongly-correlated photons, including crystals and\ntopological fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 18:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up\nobservations of iPTF 16hgs -- an intermediate luminosity and fast evolving\ntransient that exhibited a double peaked light curve. Exhibiting a typical Type\nIb spectrum in the photospheric phase and an early transition to a [Ca II]\ndominated nebular phase, we show that iPTF 16hgs shows properties consistent\nwith the class of Ca-rich gap transients, with two interesting exceptions.\nFirst, while the second peak of the light curve is similar to other Ca-rich gap\ntransients (suggesting $M_{ej}$ of 0.4 M$_\\odot$ and peak luminosity of $3\n\\times 10^{41}$ ergs s$^{-1}$), we show that the first blue and fast declining\n(over $2$ days) peak is unique to this source. Second, with Integral Field Unit\nobservations of the host galaxy, we find that iPTF 16hgs occurred in the\noutskirts (projected offset of $6$ kpc $ = 1.9 R_{eff}$) of a low metallicity\n(0.4 Z$_\\odot$), star forming, dwarf spiral galaxy. Using deep late-time VLA\nand uGMRT observations, we place stringent limits on the local environment of\nthe source, ruling out a large parameter space of circumstellar densities and\nmass loss environments of the progenitor. If iPTF 16hgs shares explosion\nphysics with the class of Ca-rich gap transients, the presence of the first\npeak can be explained by enhanced mixing of 0.01 M$_\\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni into\nthe outer layers the ejecta, reminiscent of some models of He-shell detonations\non WDs. On the other hand, if iPTF 16hgs is physically unrelated to the class,\nthe first peak is consistent with shock cooling emission (of an envelope with a\nmass of 0.08 M$_\\odot$ and radius of 13 R$_\\odot$) associated with a\ncore-collapse explosion of a highly stripped massive star in a close binary\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 18:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Because both their core and surface rotation\nrates can be measured, these stars can also be used to set strong constraints\non angular momentum transport inside stars. We find that they are rotating\nslower than angular momentum conservation and rigid rotation would predict. Our\nresults are insensitive to the degree of core-envelope coupling because of the\nsmall moment of inertia of the radiative core. We discuss two possible\nmechanisms for slowing down the surfaces of these stars: (1) substantial\nangular momentum loss, and (2) radial differential rotation in the surface\nconvection zone. Modern angular momentum loss prescriptions used for solar-type\nstars predict secondary clump surface rotation rates in much better agreement\nwith the data than prior variants used in the literature, and we argue that\nsuch enhanced loss is required to understand the combination of core and\nsurface rotation rates. However, we find that the assumed radial differential\nrotation profile in convective regions has a strong impact on the predicted\nsurface rotation rates, and that a combination of enhanced loss and radial\ndifferential rotation in the surface convection zone is also consistent with\nthe data. We discuss future tests that can quantify the impact of both\nphenomena. Current data tentatively suggests that some combination of the two\nprocesses fits the data better than either one alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The influence will be even enhanced when two groups\nof celestial objects are confined in stable orbital configurations, e.g. in\nadjacent mean motion resonances (MMRs). Plutinos and Neptune Trojans, trapped\nin the 2:3 and 1:1 MMRs with Neptune respectively, are such examples.\n%Meanwhile, many objects among these two groups have peculiar orbits, seemingly\nas the vestige of CEs. As the first part of our investigation, this paper\nprovides a detailed description of CEs between Plutinos and Trojans and their\npotential influences on the Trojans' orbits. Statistical analyses of CE data\nfrom numerical simulations reveal the randomness lying in the CEs between the\ntwo planetesimals. The closest positions of CEs distribute symmetrically inside\nthe given CE region and no particular bias is found between the positive and\nnegative effects on the orbital elements of Trojans. Based on the Gaussian\napproximation on the distribution of the velocity orientation of Plutino, and\nthe integral derivatives of Gaussian perturbation equations, a theoretical\nmethod is built to estimate the CE effects. To further verify the randomness of\nCEs, a Monte Carlo approach is applied, and it generates distribution features\nconsistent with the numerical results. In summary, CEs brought by realistic\nPlutinos exert impartial effects and tiny total influence on the orbital\nelements of Trojans. However, driven by the random walk mechanism, tiny effects\nmay accumulate to a prominent variation given sufficient CEs, which will be\ndiscussed in the accompanying paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

A doctor is\nassessing a patient's risk of developing a certain disease, and can perform $n$\ntests on the patient. Each test has a binary outcome, positive or negative. A\npositive test result is an indication of risk, and a patient's score is the\ntotal number of positive test results. The doctor needs to classify the patient\ninto one of $B$ risk classes, depending on the score (e.g., LOW, MEDIUM, and\nHIGH risk). Each of these classes corresponds to a contiguous range of scores.\nTest $i$ has probability $p_i$ of being positive, and it costs $c_i$ to perform\nthe test. To reduce costs, instead of performing all tests, the doctor will\nperform them sequentially and stop testing when it is possible to determine the\nrisk category for the patient. The problem is to determine the order in which\nthe doctor should perform the tests, so as to minimize the expected testing\ncost.

In this paper, a new method for dynamic texture characterization based\non diffusion in directed networks is proposed. The dynamic texture is modeled\nas a directed network. The method consists in the analysis of the dynamic of\nthis network after a series of graph cut transformations based on the edge\nweights.

Current\nstatistical methodologies for modeling these processes are often highly\nparameterized and thus, challenging to implement from a computational\nperspective. One potential parsimonious solution to this problem is a method\nfrom the dynamical systems and engineering literature referred to as an echo\nstate network (ESN). ESN models use so-called {\\it reservoir computing} to\nefficiently compute recurrent neural network (RNN) forecasts. Moreover,\nso-called \"deep\" models have recently been shown to be successful at predicting\nhigh-dimensional complex nonlinear processes, particularly those with multiple\nspatial and temporal scales of variability (such as we often find in\nspatio-temporal environmental data). Here we introduce a deep ensemble ESN\n(D-EESN) model. We present two versions of this model for spatio-temporal\nprocesses that both produce forecasts and associated measures of uncertainty.\nThe first approach utilizes a bootstrap ensemble framework and the second is\ndeveloped within a hierarchical Bayesian framework (BD-EESN). This more general\nhierarchical Bayesian framework naturally accommodates non-Gaussian data types\nand multiple levels of uncertainties. The methodology is first applied to a\ndata set simulated from a novel non-Gaussian multiscale Lorenz-96 dynamical\nsystem simulation model and then to a long-lead United States (U.S.) soil\nmoisture forecasting application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 01:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 21:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

In the context of signals from\nprecessing spinning binary systems, a useful tool for building models of the\nwaveform consists in representing the signal as a time-dependent rotation of a\nquasi-non-precessing waveform. In both cases, being able to compute transfer\nfunctions for these effects directly in the Fourier domain may enable\nperformance gains for data analysis applications by using fast frequency-domain\nwaveforms. Our results generalize previous approaches based on the stationary\nphase approximation for inspiral signals, extending them by including delays\nand computing corrections beyond the leading order, while being applicable to\nthe broader class of inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. In the LISA case, we\nfind that a leading-order treatment is accurate for high-mass and low-mass\nsignals that are chirping fast enough, with errors consistently reduced by the\ncorrections we derived. By contrast, low-mass binary black holes, if far away\nfrom merger and slowly-chirping, cannot be handled by this formalism and we\ndevelop another approach for these systems. In the case of precessing binaries,\nwe explore the merger-ringdown range for a handful of cases, using a simple\nmodel for the post-merger precession. We find that deviations from leading\norder can give large fractional errors, while affecting mainly subdominant\nmodes and giving rise to a limited unfaithfulness in the full waveform.\nIncluding higher-order corrections consistently reduces the unfaithfulness, and\nwe further develop an alternative approach to accurately represent post-merger\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 01:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

For general\ndata-collection tasks in UAV networks, we aim to optimize the network\nthroughput with constraints on transmission power and quality of service (QoS).\nAs far as the highly mobile and constantly changing UAV networks are concerned,\nunfortunately, most existing methods rely on definite information which is\nvulnerable to the dynamic environment, rendering system performance to be less\neffective. In order to combat dynamic topology and varying interference of UAV\nnetworks, a robust and distributed learning scheme is proposed. Rather than the\nperfect channel state information (CSI), we introduce uncertainties to\ncharacterize the dynamic channel gains among UAV nodes, which are then\ninterpreted with fuzzy numbers. Instead of the traditional observation space\nwhere the channel capacity is a crisp reward, we implement the learning and\ndecision process in a mapped fuzzy space. This allows the system to achieve a\nsmoother and more robust performance by optimizing in an alternate space. To\nthis end, we design a fuzzy payoffs function (FPF) to describe the fluctuated\nutility, and the problem of POCs assignment is formulated as a fuzzy payoffs\ngame (FPG). Assisted by an attractive property of fuzzy bi-matrix games, the\nexistence of fuzzy Nash equilibrium (FNE) for our formulated FPG is proved. Our\nrobust fuzzy-learning algorithm could reach the equilibrium solution via a\nleast-deviation method.

Generation of multi\nGHz and higher repetition-rate optical pulse trains directly from mode-locked\noscillators is often challenging. As an alternative, harmonic injection locking\ncan be applied for extra-cavity repetition-rate multiplication (RRM). Here we\nhave investigated the operation conditions and achievable performances of\nall-fibre, highly tunable harmonic injection locking-based pulse RRM. We show\nthat, with slight tuning of slave laser length, highly tunable RRM is possible\nfrom a multiplication factor of 2 to >100. The resulting maximum SMSR is 41 dB\nwhen multiplied by a factor of two. We further characterize the noise\nproperties of the multiplied signal in terms of phase noise and relative\nintensity noise. The resulting absolute rms timing jitter of the multiplied\nsignal is in the range of 20 fs to 60 fs (10 kHz - 1 MHz) for different\nmultiplication factors. With its high tunability, simple and robust all-fibre\nimplementation, and low excess noise, the demonstrated RRM system may find\ndiverse applications in microwave photonics, optical communications, photonic\nanalogue-to-digital conversion, and clock distribution networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 06:14:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 13:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

Our approach is based on the integrable nature of the\none-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation (1D-NLSE) that governs\nat leading order the propagation of the optical and hydrodynamic waves in the\ntwo experiments. Nonlinear spectral analysis provides certain spectral\nportraits of the analyzed structures that are composed of bands lying in the\ncomplex plane. The spectral portraits can be interpreted within the framework\nof the so-called finite gap theory (or periodic inverse scattering transform).\nIn particular, the number N of bands composing the nonlinear spectrum\ndetermines the genus g = N - 1 of the solution that can be viewed as a measure\nof complexity of the space-time evolution of the considered solution. Within\nthis setting the ideal, rational Peregrine soliton represents a special,\ndegenerate genus 2 solution. While the fitting procedures employed in [1] and\n[2] show that the experimentally observed structures are quite well\napproximated by the Peregrine solitons, nonlinear spectral analysis of the\nbreathers observed both in the optical fiber and in the water tank experiments\nreveals that they exhibit spectral portraits associated with more general,\ngenus 4 finite-gap NLSE solutions.

However, with the explosion of fashion\nrelated content and large number of user generated fashion photos, it is an\narduous task for fashion designers to wade through social media photos and\ncreate a digest of trending fashion. This necessitates deep parsing of fashion\nphotos on social media to localize and classify multiple fashion items from a\ngiven fashion photo. While object detection competitions such as MSCOCO have\nthousands of samples for each of the object categories, it is quite difficult\nto get large labeled datasets for fast fashion items. Moreover,\nstate-of-the-art object detectors do not have any functionality to ingest large\namount of unlabeled data available on social media in order to fine tune object\ndetectors with labeled datasets. In this work, we show application of a generic\nobject detector, that can be pretrained in an unsupervised manner, on 24\ncategories from recently released Open Images V4 dataset. We first train the\nbase architecture of the object detector using unsupervisd learning on 60K\nunlabeled photos from 24 categories gathered from social media, and then\nsubsequently fine tune it on 8.2K labeled photos from Open Images V4 dataset.\nOn 300 X 300 image inputs, we achieve 72.7% mAP on a test dataset of 2.4K\nphotos while performing 11% to 17% better as compared to the state-of-the-art\nobject detectors. We show that this improvement is due to our choice of\narchitecture that lets us do unsupervised learning and that performs\nsignificantly better in identifying small objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 06:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

In this\ncontext, amorphous SiO2 is the most widely studied material.

We compute null energy and averaged\nnull energy in the bulk in both types of deformations. We confirmed that, with\nthe suitable choice of couplings, averaged null energies are negative.

This leads to a strong dependence on information and communication\nnetworking that are prone to threats of cyberattacks, which challenges power\nsystem reliability and efficiency. Thus, significant attention should be paid\nto the Smart Grids security. Recently, it has been proven that False Data\nInjection Attacks (FDIA) could corrupt results of State Estimation (SE) without\nnoticing, therefore, leading to a possible mis-operation of the whole power\nsystem. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for detecting cyberattacks\nbased on non-linear filtering by using cyber-physical information from\nKirchhoff laws. The proposed algorithm only needs data from adjacent nodes,\ntherefore can be locally and distributed implemented. Also, it requires very\nlow computational effort so that it can be run online, and it is suitable for\nimplementation in existing or new ad-hoc low-cost devices. The proposed\nalgorithm could be helpful to increase power system awareness against FDIA\ncomplementing the current SE implementations. The efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm has been proved by mathematical simulations and computer modeling in\nPSCAD software.

The dynamics induced by second and third\norder harmonics resemble smooth stretchings, respectively translations, of the\nidentity, while the ones induced by fourth order harmonics resemble\nmagnifications and rotations. Starting with order three, the dynamics pass\nthrough extended regions of seemingly random configurations which spontaneously\nreassemble into accentuated patterns.

Since the original sandpile group is a subgroup of the\nextended one, this directly implies that it admits a natural renormalization.\nFurthermore, we show that the harmonic fields can be induced by simple Markov\nprocesses, and that the corresponding stochastic dynamics show remarkable\nrobustness over hundreds of periods.

One of the commonly used mechanisms, Least Recently\nUsed (LRU), works well for identical file sizes. However, for asymmetric file\nsizes, the performance deteriorates. This paper proposes an adaptation to the\nLRU strategy, called gLRU, where the file is sub-divided into equal-sized\nchunks. In this strategy, a chunk of the newly requested file is added in the\ncache, and a chunk of the least-recently-used file is removed from the cache.\nEven though approximate analysis for the hit rate has been studied for LRU, the\nanalysis does not extend to gLRU since the metric of interest is no longer the\nhit rate as the cache has partial files. This paper provides a novel\napproximation analysis for this policy where the cache may have partial file\ncontents. The approximation approach is validated by simulations. Further, gLRU\noutperforms the LRU strategy for a Zipf file popularity distribution and\ncensored Pareto file size distribution for the file download times. Video\nstreaming applications can further use the partial cache contents to help the\nstall duration significantly, and the numerical results indicate significant\nimprovements (32\\%) in stall duration using the gLRU strategy as compared to\nthe LRU strategy.

Non-thermal radio emission has been detected so far\nonly from the bowshock of BD+43{\\deg}3654, whereas the detection of non-thermal\nradiation from these bowshocks at high energies remains elusive. Aims: We aim\nat characterising in detail the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission from\nstellar bowshocks accounting for the structure of the region of interaction\nbetween the stellar wind and its environment. Methods: We develop a\nbroadband-radiative, multi-zone model for stellar bowshocks that takes into\naccount the spatial structure of the emitting region and the observational\nconstraints. The model predicts the evolution and the emission of the\nrelativistic particles accelerated and streaming together with the shocked\nflow. Results: We present broadband non-thermal spectral energy distributions\nfor different scenarios, synthetic radio-cm synchrotron maps that reproduce the\nmorphology of BD+43{\\deg}3654, and updated predictions in X-ray and gamma-ray\nenergy ranges. We also compare the results of the multi-zone model applied in\nthis work with those of a refined one-zone model. Conclusions: A multi-zone\nmodel provides better constraints than a one-zone model on the relevant\nparameters, namely the magnetic field intensity and the amount of energy\ndeposited in non-thermal particles. However, one-zone models can be improved by\ncarefully characterising the intensity of the IR dust photon field and the\nescape rate of the plasma from the shocked region. Finally, comparing observed\nradio maps with those obtained from a multi-zone model enables constraints to\nbe obtained on the direction of stellar motion with respect to the observer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 10:08:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2018 14:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

We create a list\nof sources detected in the energy range between 30 and 100 MeV, which closes a\ngap of point source analysis between the COMPTEL catalog and the Fermi-LAT\ncatalogs. One of the main challenges in the analysis of point sources is the\nconstruction of the background diffuse emission model. In our analysis, we use\na background-independent method to search for point-like sources based on a\nwavelet transform implemented in the PGWave code.

The ratio of the number of flat\nspectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) to BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) in 1FLE is 3 to 1, which\ncan be compared with an approximately 1 to 1 ratio for the 3FGL or a 1 to 6\nratio for 3FHL.

That is to leverage neural representations to\nhelp re-rank a set of candidate documents, which are typically obtained from an\ninitial retrieval stage based on some symbolic index and search scheme (e.g.,\nBM25 over the inverted index).

Indeed, it\nassumes a particular cosmological model (namely the flat $\\Lambda$CDM) to\ncalibrate the standardisation corrections parameters, i.e. the dependency of\nthe supernova peak absolute magnitude on its colour, post-maximum decline rate\nand host galaxy mass. As a result, this assumption could make the data\ncompliant to the assumed cosmology and thus nullify all works previously\nconducted on model comparison. In this work, we verify the viability of these\nhypotheses by developing a cosmology-independent approach to standardise SNe Ia\ndata from the recent JLA compilation. Our resulting corrections turn out to be\nvery close to the $\\Lambda$CDM-based corrections. Therefore, even if a\n$\\Lambda$CDM-based calibration is questionable from a theoretical point of\nview, the potential compliance of SNe Ia data does not happen in practice for\nthe JLA compilation. Previous works of model comparison based on these data do\nnot have to be called into question.

Unfortunately, whilst potentially\nvery powerful, unsupervised methods for uncovering labels based on topology\nalone has been shown to suffer from several difficulties.

While\nthere can be several arguments for the use of a ledger, the key question is\nwhether it can fully replace any single trusted party in the system as\notherwise a (potentially simpler) solution can be built around the trusted\nparty. In this paper, we introduce an abstract view on ledger use cases and\npresent two fundamental criteria that must be met for any use case to be\nimplemented using a ledger-based approach without having to rely on any\nparticular party in the system. Moreover, we evaluate several ledger use cases\nthat have recently received considerable attention according to these criteria,\nrevealing that often participants need to trust each other despite using a\ndistributed ledger.

In our previous work\n[arXiv:1711.03528] such dynamics was attributed to the existence of \"quantum\nscarred\" eigenstates in the many-body spectrum of the experimentally realized\nmodel. Here we present a detailed study of the eigenstate properties of the\nsame model. We find that the majority of the eigenstates exhibit anomalous\nthermalization: the observable expectation values converge to their Gibbs\nensemble values, but parametrically slower compared to the predictions of the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Amidst the thermalizing spectrum,\nwe identify non-ergodic eigenstates that strongly violate the ETH, whose number\ngrows polynomially with system size. Previously, the same eigenstates were\nidentified via large overlaps with certain product states, and were used to\nexplain the revivals observed in experiment. Here we find that these\neigenstates, in addition to highly atypical expectation values of local\nobservables, also exhibit sub-thermal entanglement entropy that scales\nlogarithmically with the system size. Moreover, we identify an additional class\nof quantum scarred eigenstates, and discuss their manifestations in the\ndynamics starting from initial product states. We use forward scattering\napproximation to describe the structure and physical properties of\nquantum-scarred eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the stability of quantum scars\nto various perturbations.

Thereby, we consider different means of control\nsuch as spatio-temporal modulations of the neural firing threshold, asymmetric\nsynaptic coupling kernels, and additive inputs. Treating these controls as\nperturbations to the neural field system, one obtains an equation of motion for\ntraveling wave solutions in response to the applied controls.

We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment.

The use of asymmetric cryptography is not a\npractical solution for IMDs due to the scarce computational and power\nresources, symmetric key cryptography is preferred. One of the factors in\nsecurity of a symmetric cryptographic system is to use a strong key for\nencryption. A solution without using extensive resources in an IMD, is to\nextract it from the body physiological signals. To have a strong enough key,\nthe physiological signal must be a strong source of randomness and InterPulse\nInterval (IPI) has been advised to be such that. A strong randomness source\nshould have five conditions: Universality, Liveness, Robustness Permanence and\nUniqueness. Nevertheless, for current proposed random extraction methods from\nIPI these conditions (mainly last three conditions) were not examined. In this\nstudy, firstly, we proposed a methodology to measure the last three conditions.\nThen, using a huge dataset of IPI values, we showed that IPI does not have\nconditions of Robustness and Permanence. Thus, extraction of a strong uniform\nrandom number from IPI value, mathematically, is impossible. Thirdly, rather\nthan using the value of IPI, we proposed the trend of IPI as a source for a new\nrandomness extraction method named as Martingale Randomness Extraction from IPI\n(MRE-IPI). MRE-IPI satisfies the Robustness condition completely and Permanence\nto some level. We, also, used randomness test suites and showed that MRE-IPI is\nable to outperform all recent randomness extraction methods from IPIs and its\nquality is half of the AES random number.

Two main obstacles appear for\nthe cooperation of simulation and experiment: on the one hand, the frequent\nlack of a degree of uncertainty associated with calculated data. On the other,\nthe concomitant underlying feeling that calculation parameters can be tuned\nwith the explicit aim of matching the experimental results, even at the expense\nof the quality of the simulation. Without the definition of an error bar for\nestimating the precision of the calculation, direct comparison of calculated\nand experimental data can lack physical significance. In this contribution, we\nemploy the well known delocalization error of DFT and HF to develop a simple\nand robust procedure to quickly estimate an error bar for calculated quantities\nin the field of solid state chemistry. First, we validate our model on one of\nthe simplest properties of a solid, the geometry of its unit cell, which can be\ndetermined experimentally with high accuracy. In this case, our computational\nwindow is too large to provide a useful error bar. However, it provides\ncomputational material scientists with a pointer on how much a given system is\naffected by the method of choice, i.e. how much it is sensible to parameter\ntuning and how much care should be taken in doing it. Then, we move to another\nquantity which has a greater experimental uncertainty, namely transition\npressure, and show that our approach can lead to error bars comparable to\nexperiment. Hence, both experiment and theory can be compared on an even basis\ntaking into account the uncertainty introduced by the scientist, both in the\nmeasuring conditions and the tuning of computational parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 14:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

Currently, wavefront correction systems are typically approximated\nas linear systems using Fourier optics.

Moreover, the\ntelescope optical system varies over time because of instrument instabilities\nand environmental effects. In this paper, we present an\nexpectation-maximization (E-M) approach for identifying and real-time adapting\nthe linear telescope model from data.

Beyond\npossible doubts on the validity of these solutions, we propose two answers to\nthis apparent puzzle. A first possibility is that the known 10d solutions\nalways exhibit an energy scale of order or higher than a Kaluza-Klein scale, as\nwe argue.

The deficiencies lead to substantially underestimated\nphonon irradiation for low-frequency phonons. Here, we develop an anisotropic\nmodel with truncated linear dispersion that resembles the real phonon\ndispersion, using speeds of sounds derived from elastic constants and cutoff\nfrequencies derived from Brillouin zone boundaries. We also employ a piecewise\nlinear function for the ZA phonons. Our model correctly calculates the phonon\nirradiation over a wide temperature range, verifying the accuracy of our\nmodel.We compare calculations of our and the Dames models to measurements of\nthermal conductivity of graphite and thermal conductance of metal/graphite\ninterfaces, and find that the two models differ significantly for heat\ntransport across the basal planes in graphite even at high temperatures. Our\nwork thus provides a convenient analytical tool to study the phonon transport\nproperties in layered materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 14:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 11:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

In this paper we refine this description by\nemphasizing the existence of more generic phase diagrams with a hybrid-hard\nphase in which it is computationally easy to reach a non-trivial inference\naccuracy, but computationally hard to match the information theoretically\noptimal one. We support this discussion by quantitative expansions of the\nfunctional cavity equations that describe inference problems on sparse graphs.\nThese expansions shed light on the existence of hybrid-hard phases, for a large\nclass of planted constraint satisfaction problems, and on the question of the\ntightness of the Kesten-Stigum (KS) bound for the associated tree\nreconstruction problem. Our results show that the instability of the trivial\nfixed point is not a generic evidence for the Bayes-optimality of the message\npassing algorithms. We clarify in particular the status of the symmetric SBM\nwith 4 communities and of the tree reconstruction of the associated Potts\nmodel: in the assortative (ferromagnetic) case the KS bound is always tight,\nwhereas in the disassortative (antiferromagnetic) case we exhibit an explicit\ncriterion involving the degree distribution that separates a large degree\nregime where the KS bound is tight and a low degree regime where it is not.

The magnitude of the\ninduced uniaxial anisotropy grows with the increasing external magnetic field.\nThe filler particles are immobilized in the matrix if the MAE sample is cooled\nbelow 220 K, where the anisotropy can be read out. The cooling of the sample is\nconsidered as an alternative methodological approach to the experimental\ninvestigation of the magnetized state of MAEs.

It is found that the magnitude of the effective magnetic\nanisotropy constant of the MAE is approximately two times larger than its\neffective shear modulus in the absence of magnetic field. It is proposed that\nthe experimentally observed large (about 40) ratio of the magnetic anisotropy\nconstant of the filler to the shear modulus of the matrix deserves attention\nfor the explanation of magnetic and magnetoelastic properties of MAEs.

These challenges are addressed in this paper by\npresenting a fully autonomous and distributed underlay DSA scheme where each CR\noperates based on predicting its transmission effect on the PN. The scheme is\nbased on a cognitive engine with an artificial neural network that predicts,\nwithout exchanging information between the networks, the adaptive modulation\nand coding configuration for the primary link nearest to a transmitting CR. By\nmanaging the effect of the SN on the PN, the presented technique maintains the\nrelative average throughput change in the PN within a prescribed maximum value,\nwhile also finding transmit settings for the CRs that result in throughput as\nlarge as allowed by the PN interference limit. Simulation results show that the\nability of the cognitive engine in estimating the effect of a CR transmission\non the full adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) mode leads to a much more fine\nunderlay transmit power control. This ability also provides higher transmission\nopportunities for the CRs, compared to a scheme that can only estimate the\nmodulation scheme used at the PN link.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 15:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 17:08:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 21:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 00:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

In this paper, we introduce the\ninvolved research challenges and survey related work on the detection of\nlearning needs, understanding of users, e.g. with respect to their knowledge\nstate, learning tasks and learning progress throughout a search session as well\nas the actual consideration of learning needs throughout the retrieval and\nranking process. In addition, we summarise our own research contributing to the\naforementioned tasks and describe our research agenda in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 15:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

Next, we demonstrate that the\nadversary can use this association graph to break user privacy with\nsignificantly shorter traces than in the case of independent users, and that\nobfuscating data traces independently across users is often insufficient to\nremedy such leakage.

In fact, the\ntemperature is proportional to the proper acceleration quadratically near the\norigin of the circular motion as compared to the usual Unruh effect depending\non the linear proper acceleration. On the other hand, in the drifted Rindler\nmotion, the observer moves with a relative velocity in the direction transverse\nto the acceleration. If the detector is moving slowly in the transverse\ndirection with a finite proper acceleration, then the temperature behaves like\nthe usual Unruh temperature, while it vanishes for the speed of light in the\ntransverse direction according to the infinite proper acceleration.\nConsequently, it turns out that the temperatures behave nonlinearly with\nrespect to the proper acceleration and the infinite proper acceleration would\nnot always permit the divergent temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 08:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

Flexibilities are provided in form of thermal and electrical\nstorage systems leading to many possible setting options requiring an\nelaborated control management.

A predictive controller based on a\nmixed integer optimization problem and an additional so called secondary,\nrule-based controller is combined. The controller is based on several input\ndata. Depending on the choice of these data the PV-CHP hybrid system can be\nused for different control strategies, like maximum self-consumption, minimum\nCO2 emission or minimum operational costs. The main focus in this paper is to\nstudy if the flexibility potentials of the combined thermal and electrical\nstorage systems can ensure a market oriented or a grid-friendly behavior.

Our approach is (a) content agnostic as the same methodology is\nemployed to re-edit a wide-angle video recording or a close-up movie sequence\ncaptured with a static or moving camera, and (b) independent of video length\nand can in principle re-edit an entire movie in one shot.

Recent deep learning algorithms enable\nthe development of machine learning methods that can get high dimensional data\nas an input. In this work, we use imitation learning to teach the robot to\ndribble the ball to the goal. We use B-Human robot software to collect\ndemonstration data and a deep convolutional network to represent the policies.\nWe use top and bottom camera images of the robot as input and speed commands as\noutputs. The CNN policy learns the mapping between the series of images and\nspeed commands. In 3D realistic robotics simulator experiments, we show that\nthe robot is able to learn to search the ball and dribble the ball, but it\nstruggles to align to the goal. The best-proposed policy model learns to score\n4 goals out of 20 test episodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 15:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

For the majority of the samples we find one master curve, where\nswallowing takes place after the information increases from its minimum. The\nmaster curve may indicate a simplifying principle during mastication and\nsubsequent swallowing. We have also calculated a particular complexity measure.\nThis measure displays an increase just before swallowing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 13:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}
