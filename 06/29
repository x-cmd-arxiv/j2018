The use of Big Data Analytics technologies allows to significantly the\nexecution times of the algorithm so to be used even in current, high-speed\nnetworks. The paper describes our approach and presents an experimental\nanalysis in terms of detection performance and execution time. We use real\ntraffic traces from MAWI archive and MAWILab anomaly detectors to compare with\nour results. The analysis shows that i) our traditional threshold-based\nalgorithm is already able to achieve detection performance higher than MAWILab\n(in 95% of the considered cases with the best threshold value), currently\nconsidered the gold standard in the field; ii) the execution time is much\nshorter than the trace time, which makes it usable also in real time.

The extraction of the neutrino mass\nordering is a data-driven field expected to evolve very rapidly in the next\ndecade. In this review, we both analyze the present status and describe the\nphysics of subsequent prospects. Firstly, the different current available tools\nto measure the neutrino mass ordering are described. Namely, reactor,\nlong-baseline (accelerator and atmospheric) neutrino beams, laboratory searches\nfor beta and neutrinoless double beta decays and observations of the cosmic\nbackground radiation and the large scale structure of the universe are\ncarefully reviewed. Secondly, the results from an up-to-date comprehensive\nglobal fit are reported: the Bayesian analysis to the 2018 publicly available\noscillation and cosmological data sets provides \\emph{strong} evidence for the\nnormal neutrino mass ordering versus the inverted scenario, with a significance\nof 3.5 standard deviations. This preference for the normal neutrino mass\nordering is mostly due to neutrino oscillation measurements. Finally, we shall\nalso emphasize the future perspectives for unveiling the neutrino mass\nordering. In this regard, apart from describing the expectations from the\naforementioned probes, we also focus on those arising from alternative and\nnovel methods, as 21~cm cosmology, core-collapse supernova neutrinos and the\ndirect detection of relic neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 13:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

To control despotic behaviour, followers\ncan assess leaders decisions by aggregating their own and their neighbours\nexperience, and in response challenge despotic leaders. But in hierarchical\nsocial networks, this interactional justice can be limited by (i) the high\ninfluence of a small clique who are treated better, and (ii) the low\nconnectedness of followers. Here we study how the connectedness of a social\nnetwork affects the co-evolution of despotism in leaders and tolerance to\ndespotism in followers. We simulate the evolution of a population of agents,\nwhere the influence of an agent is its number of social links. Whether a leader\nremains in power is controlled by the overall satisfaction of group members, as\ndetermined by their joint assessment of the leaders behaviour. We demonstrate\nthat centralization of a social network around a highly influential clique\ngreatly increases the level of despotism. This is because the clique is more\nsatisfied, and their higher influence spreads their positive opinion of the\nleader throughout the network. Finally, our results suggest that increasing the\nconnectedness of followers limits despotism while maintaining hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-29"}

In\nthe limit of strong optical nonlinearities (hard-core limit), the BHM maps on\nthe dissipative, transverse-field XY model (XYM). The steady-state of the XYM\ncan be analyzed using mean-field theory, which reveals a plethora of\ninteresting dynamical phenomena. For example, strong hopping combined with a\nblue-detuned drive, leads to an instability of the homogeneous steady-state\nwith respect to antiferromagnetic fluctuations. In this paper, we address the\nquestion whether such an antiferromagnetic instability survives in the presence\nof quantum correlations beyond the mean-field approximation. For that purpose,\nwe employ a self-consistent $1/z$ expansion for the density matrix, where $z$\nis the lattice coordination number, i.e., the number of nearest neighbours for\neach site. We show that quantum fluctuations stabilize a new homogeneous\nsteady-state with antiferromagnetic correlations in agreement with exact\nnumerical simulations for finite lattices. The latter manifests itself as\nshort-ranged oscillations of the first and second-order spatial coherence\nfunctions of the photons emitted by the array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

MRS is used in vivo clinically to aid in the diagnosis of\nseveral pathologies that affect metabolic pathways in the body. Typically, this\nexperiment produces a one dimensional (1D) 1H spectrum containing several peaks\nthat are well associated with biochemicals, or metabolites. However, since many\nof these peaks overlap, distinguishing chemicals with similar atomic structures\nbecomes much more challenging. One technique capable of overcoming this issue\nis the localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY) experiment, which acquires a\nsecond spectral dimension and spreads overlapping signal across this second\ndimension. Unfortunately, the acquisition of a two dimensional (2D)\nspectroscopy experiment is extremely time consuming. Furthermore, quantitation\nof a 2D spectrum is more complex. Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged\nin the field of medicine as a powerful force capable of diagnosing disease,\naiding in treatment, and even predicting treatment outcome. In this study, we\nutilize deep learning to: 1) accelerate the L-COSY experiment and 2) quantify\nL-COSY spectra. We demonstrate that our deep learning model greatly outperforms\ncompressed sensing based reconstruction of L-COSY spectra at higher\nacceleration factors. Specifically, at four-fold acceleration, our method has\nless than 5% normalized mean squared error, whereas compressed sensing yields\n20% normalized mean squared error. We also show that at low SNR (25% noise\ncompared to maximum signal), our deep learning model has less than 8%\nnormalized mean squared error for quantitation of L-COSY spectra. These pilot\nsimulation results appear promising and may help improve the efficiency and\naccuracy of L-COSY experiments in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Using collisionless\n$N$-body simulations of dwarf galaxy (DG) mergers, we examine how the orbital\ndecay of IMBHs and the efficiency of IMBH binary formation depend on the\ncentral dark matter (DM) density profile of the merging DGs. Specifically, we\nexplore various asymptotic inner slopes $\\gamma$ of the DG's DM density\ndistribution, ranging from steep cusps ($\\gamma=1$) to shallower density\nprofiles ($\\gamma<1$), motivated by well-known baryonic-feedback effects as\nwell as by DM models that differ from cold DM at the scales of DGs.

Consequently, the rate of LISA signals from\nIMBH coalescence will be determined by the fraction of DGs with a cuspy DM\nprofile.

Using Principal Component\nAnalysis we identify the key axes of correlation between these physical\nquantities, for the full galaxy sample and split by satellite/central and\nlow/high halo mass. The first principal component of the z=0 EAGLE galaxy\npopulation is a positive correlation between M_halo, M* and SFR. This component\nis particularly dominant for central galaxies in low mass haloes. The second\nprincipal component, most significant in high mass haloes, is a negative\ncorrelation between M_halo and SFR, indicative of environmental quenching. For\ngalaxies above M*~10^10M_solar, however, the SFR is seen to decouple from the\nM_halo-M* correlation; this result is found to be independent of environment,\nsuggesting that mass quenching effects are also in operation.

Finally, we present halo occupation\ndistribution model fits to EAGLE galaxies and show that one flexible\n6-parameter functional form is capable of fitting a wide range of different\nmass- and SFR-selected subsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

These appear when discretizing the time evolution generated by\nthe Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system as a sequence of quantum gates,\ncalled Trotterization. Here, we show that quantum localization-by constraining\nthe time evolution through quantum interference-strongly bounds these errors\nfor local observables. Consequently, for generic quantum many-body\nHamiltonians, Trotter errors can become independent of system size and total\nsimulation time. For local observables, DQS is thus intrinsically much more\nrobust than what one might expect from known error bounds on the global\nmany-body wave function. This robustness is characterized by a sharp threshold\nas a function of the Trotter step size. The threshold separates a regular\nregion with controllable Trotter errors, where the system exhibits localization\nin the space of eigenstates of the time-evolution operator, from a quantum\nchaotic regime where the trajectory is quickly scrambled throughout the entire\nHilbert space. Our findings show that DQS with comparatively large Trotter\nsteps can retain controlled Trotter errors for local observables.

While deep learning models often work well for 2D instance\nsegmentation, 3D instance segmentation still faces critical challenges, such as\ninsufficient training data due to various annotation difficulties in 3D\nbiomedical images. Common 3D annotation methods (e.g., full voxel annotation)\nincur high workloads and costs for labeling enough instances for training deep\nlearning 3D instance segmentation models. In this paper, we propose a new weak\nannotation approach for training a fast deep learning 3D instance segmentation\nmodel without using full voxel mask annotation. Our approach needs only 3D\nbounding boxes for all instances and full voxel annotation for a small fraction\nof the instances, and uses a novel two-stage 3D instance segmentation model\nutilizing these two kinds of annotation, respectively. We evaluate our approach\non several biomedical image datasets, and the experimental results show that\n(1) with full annotated boxes and a small amount of masks, our approach can\nachieve similar performance as the best known methods using full annotation,\nand (2) with similar annotation time, our approach outperforms the best known\nmethods that use full annotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 18:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

In a previous work we used a phenomenological formulation\nof relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray\nemission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late\nafterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission\nalone can explain late afterglows. We find that collision between a mildly\nrelativistic outflow from the merger with a Lorentz factor of $\\sim 1.2-3$ and\nthe ISM/circumburst material can explain observations, if the synchrotron\nself-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are\ntaken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary\nto explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here\nand can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its\nencounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly\nmagnetized. The origin for optical extinction could be a dust rich old faint\nstar cluster surrounding the BNS, which had also helped its formation and\nmerger. Such environment evades present observational constraints and is\nconsistent with our conclusions about properties and evolution of the\nprogenitor neutron stars obtained from the prompt gamma-ray. If the synchrotron\nemission was produced by collision between density shells, the extinction might\nhave occurred inside the outflow itself rather than externally.

The key difference between this dynamo\nand its magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) counterpart is the adiabatic production of\nmagnetic-field-aligned pressure anisotropy by the amplification of a weak seed\nfield. This in turn drives kinetic instabilities on the ion-Larmor\nscale---namely, firehose and mirror---which sever the adiabatic link between\nthe thermal and magnetic pressures, thereby allowing the dynamo to proceed.\nAfter an initial phase of rapid growth driven by these instabilities, the\nmagnetic energy grows exponentially and exhibits a $k^{3/2}$ spectrum that\npeaks near the resistive scale, similar to the large-magnetic-Prandtl-number\n($\\mathrm{Pm}\\gg{1}$) MHD dynamo. The magnetic field self-organizes into a\nfolded-sheet topology, with direction reversals at the resistive scale and\nfield lines curved at the parallel scale of the flow. The effective\n$\\mathrm{Pm}$ is determined by whether the ion-Larmor scale is above or below\nthe field-reversing scale: in the former case, particles undergo Bohm-like\ndiffusion; in the latter case, particles scatter primarily off firehose\nfluctuations residing at the ends of the magnetic folds, and the viscosity\nbecomes anisotropic. The magnetic field ultimately saturates at dynamical\nstrengths, with its spectral peak migrating towards larger scales. This\nfeature, along with an anti-correlation of magnetic-field strength and\nfield-line curvature and a gradual thinning of magnetic sheets into ribbons,\nresemble the saturated state of the large-$\\mathrm{Pm}$ dynamo, the primary\ndifferences manifesting in firehose/mirror-unstable regions.

A Pareto optimal exchange of their scoring outcomes provides the\nbasis for a comparison of forecast quality that is preferred by both\nforecasters, and also evades a feature of arbitrariness inherent in using the\nforecasters' own achieved scores. The well-known Kullback divergence, used as a\nmeasure of information, is evaluated via the entropies in the two forecast\ndistributions and the two cross-entropies between them.

Conventional compressed sensing utilizes\nsparsity to recover low dimensional signal structures in high ambient\ndimensions using few measurements, where i.i.d measurements are at disposal.\nHowever real world scenarios typically exhibit non i.i.d and dynamic structures\nand are confined by physical constraints, preventing applicability of the\ntheoretical guarantees of compressed sensing and limiting its applications. In\nthis thesis we develop new theory, algorithms and applications for non i.i.d\nand dynamic compressed sensing by considering such constraints. In the first\npart of this thesis we derive new optimal sampling-complexity tradeoffs for two\ncommonly used processes used to model dependent temporal structures: the\nautoregressive processes and self-exciting generalized linear models. Our\ntheoretical results successfully recovered the temporal dependencies in neural\nactivities, financial data and traffic data. Next, we develop a new framework\nfor studying temporal dynamics by introducing compressible state-space models,\nwhich simultaneously utilize spatial and temporal sparsity. We develop a fast\nalgorithm for optimal inference on such models and prove its optimal recovery\nguarantees. Our algorithm shows significant improvement in detecting sparse\nevents in biological applications such as spindle detection and calcium\ndeconvolution.

The belief propagation (BP) decoder allows for\nparallel decoding of polar codes, making it suitable for high throughput\napplications. However, the error-correction performance of polar codes under BP\ndecoding is far from the requirements of 5G. It has been shown that the\nerror-correction performance of BP can be improved if the decoding is performed\non multiple permuted factor graphs of polar codes. However, a different BP\ndecoding scheduling is required for each factor graph permutation which results\nin the design of a different decoder for each permutation. Moreover, the\nselection of the different factor graph permutations is at random, which\nprevents the decoder to achieve a desirable error-correction performance with a\nsmall number of permutations. In this paper, we first show that the\npermutations on the factor graph can be mapped into suitable permutations on\nthe codeword positions. As a result, we can make use of a single decoder for\nall the permutations. In addition, we introduce a method to construct a set of\npredetermined permutations which can provide the correct codeword if the\ndecoding fails on the original permutation. We show that for the 5G polar code\nof length $1024$, the error-correction performance of the proposed decoder is\nmore than $0.25$ dB better than that of the BP decoder with the same number of\nrandom permutations at the frame error rate of $10^{-4}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 21:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

A special case of our method\nchecks additivity between one variable of interest and another set of\nvariables, where the additive model allows for direct interpretation of the\nvariable of interest while adjusting for the remaining variables in a flexible,\nnonparametric manner. We extended the above approaches to allow a binary\nresponse using a logit link. We also propose a systematic way to design\nsimulations that are used in additivity assessment. In simulation studies, PsBF\nshowed better performance compared to out-of-sample prediction error in\nchoosing the correct model, while avoiding computationally expensive\ncross-validation and providing an interpretable criterion for model selection.\nWe applied our approach to two different examples with a continuous and binary\noutcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 23:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

In particular, the raw depth video is densely projected\nwith respect to different virtual imaging viewpoints by rotating the virtual\ncamera within the 3D space.

In order\nto predict turbulent flows with reasonable computational time and accuracy,\nthese equations are spatially filtered according to the large-eddy simulation\n(LES) approach. The current work applies a volume filtering procedure according\nto Schumann (1975). To demonstrate the procedure the Schumann filter is first\napplied to a convection-diffusion equation. The Schumann filter results in\nvolume-averaged equations, which are not closed. To close these equations a\nmodel is introduced, which represents the interaction between the resolved\nscales and the small subgrid scales. Here, the anisotropic minimum-dissipation\nmodel of Rozema et al. (2015) is considered. The interpolation scheme necessary\nto evaluate the convective flux at the cell faces can be viewed as a second\nfilter. Thus, the convection term of the filtered convection-diffusion equation\ncan be interpreted as a double-filtered term. This term is approximated by the\nscale similarity model of Bardina et al. (1983). Thus, a mixed\nminimum-dissipation-Bardina model is obtained. Secondly, the mathematical\nmethodology is extended to the Navier-Stokes equations.

Finally, spatially filtered Navier-Stokes equations that depend on both\nthe anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model proposed by Rozema et al.\n(2015) and the scale similarity model of Bardina et al.

In this\npaper, we begin our analysis of human cognition via formal methods and proceed\ntowards quantum theories. Human cognition often violate classic probabilities\non which formal representation of conceptual spaces are built. Further,\ngeometric representation of conceptual spaces proposed by Gardenfors discusses\nthe underlying content but lacks a systematic approach (Gardenfors, 2000; Kitto\net. al, 2012). However, the aforementioned views are not contradictory but\ndifferent perspective with a gap towards sufficient understanding of human\ncognitive process.

We suggest that\nthe slowly-moving waves are slow-mode waves, and interpret this phenomenon as\nthe magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave mode conversion from the fast mode to the\nslow mode.

For the most common type of progenitors, likely with slowly rotating\ncores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations of\nthe proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion. We present a new procedure\nto compute the eigenmodes of the system formed by the PNS and the stalled\naccretion shock in general relativity including spacetime perturbations. The\nnew method improves on previous results by accounting for perturbations of both\nthe lapse function and the conformal factor. We apply our analysis to two\nnumerical core-collapse simulations and show that our improved method is able\nto obtain eigenfrequencies that accurately match the features observed in the\nGW signal and to predict the qualitative behaviour of quasi-radial\noscillations. Our analysis is possible thanks to a newly developed algorithm to\nclassify the computed eigenmodes in different classes (f-, p-, and g-modes),\nimproving previous results which suffered from misclassification issues. We\nfind that most of the GW energy is stored in the lowest order eigenmodes, in\nparticular in the $^2g_1$ mode and in the $^2f$ mode.

Using\nour recommendations, we are able to train a CNN reducing the number of false\npositives by an order of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art.\nSetting the requirements at 90% recall, our CNN allows to reduce the amount of\ndata required for manual verification by three times, thus making it possible\nfor rangers to screen all the data acquired efficiently and to detect almost\nall animals in the reserve automatically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 11:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

High activity of proteins reduces the cost\nof biocatalysts. A model that can predict protein activity from amino acid\nsequence is highly desired, as it aids experimental improvement of proteins.\nHowever, only limited data for protein activity are currently available, which\nprevents the development of such models. Since protein activity and solubility\nare correlated for some proteins, the publicly available solubility dataset may\nbe adopted to develop models that can predict protein solubility from sequence.\nThe models could serve as a tool to indirectly predict protein activity from\nsequence. In literature, predicting protein solubility from sequence has been\nintensively explored, but the predicted solubility represented in binary values\nfrom all the developed models was not suitable for guiding experimental designs\nto improve protein solubility.

In the post-adiabatic stage the magnetic field has an\nimportant and significant dynamical effect on the shock dynamics, the flow\nstructure, and hence the acceleration and emission of cosmic rays. We find that\nthe tangential component of the magnetic field provides pressure support that\nto a fair degree prevents the collapse of the radiative shell and thus limits\nthe total compression ratio of the partially or fully radiative forward shock.\nA consequence is that the spectra of cosmic rays would not be as hard as in\nhydrodynamic simulations.

A positive density gradient shortens the\nevolutionary stages whereas a shock obliquity lowers the shock compression. The\ncompression of the tangential component of the magnetic field leads to its\ndominance in the downstream region of post-adiabatic shocks for a wide range of\norientation of the upstream field, which may explain why one preferentially\nobserves tangential radio polarization in old SNRs.

In this work we provide a strong theoretical and numerical\nevidence that for a class of metallic compounds (known as triple point\ntopological metals), the points in the phonon spectrum, at which three (two\noptical and one acoustic) phonon modes (bands) cross, represent a well-defined\ntopological material phase, in which the hosting metals have very strong\nthermoelectric response. The triple point bosonic collective excitations\nappearing due to these topological phonon band-crossing points significantly\nsuppress the lattice thermal conductivity, making such metals phonon-glass\nlike. At the same time, the topological triple-point and Weyl fermionic\nquasiparticle excitations present in these metals yield good electrical\ntransport (electron-crystal) and cause a local enhancement in the electronic\ndensity of states near the Fermi level, which considerably improves the\nthermopower. This combination of \"phonon-glass\" and \"electron-crystal\" is the\nkey for high thermoelectric performance in metals.

This scenario requires learning from just a few training\nexamples if we want to impose only a light training load on the user. To this\nend, we propose a gesture classifier based on a hierarchical probabilistic\nmodeling approach. In this framework, high-level features that are shared among\ndifferent gestures can be extracted from a large labeled data set, yielding a\nprior distribution for gestures. When learning new types of gestures, the\nlearned shared prior reduces the number of required training examples for\nindividual gestures.

We\nargue here that perturbative predictions about evolution for very long times\nnear a horizon are subject to problems of secular growth - i.e. powers of small\ncouplings come systematically together with growing functions of time. Such\ngrowth signals a breakdown of naive perturbative calculations of late-time\nbehaviour, regardless of how small ambient curvatures might be. Similar issues\nof secular growth also arise in cosmology, and we build evidence for the case\nthat such effects should be generic for gravitational fields.

This topic represents a very challenging task and\nthe advent of deep learning enabled to tackle this problem with excellent\nresults. However, these architectures are extremely deep and complex. Thus,\nreal-time performance can be achieved only by leveraging power-hungry GPUs that\ndo not allow to infer depth maps in application fields characterized by\nlow-power constraints. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel\narchitecture capable to quickly infer an accurate depth map on a CPU, even of\nan embedded system, using a pyramid of features extracted from a single input\nimage. Similarly to state-of-the-art, we train our network in an unsupervised\nmanner casting depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem. Extensive\nexperimental results on the KITTI dataset show that compared to the top\nperforming approach our network has similar accuracy but a much lower\ncomplexity (about 6% of parameters) enabling to infer a depth map for a KITTI\nimage in about 1.7 s on the Raspberry Pi 3 and at more than 8 Hz on a standard\nCPU. Moreover, by trading accuracy for efficiency, our network allows to infer\nmaps at about 2 Hz and 40 Hz respectively, still being more accurate than most\nstate-of-the-art slower methods. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first\nmethod enabling such performance on CPUs paving the way for effective\ndeployment of unsupervised monocular depth estimation even on embedded systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 14:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 14:09:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 10:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

We consider the problem of slip on a fault that lies within an\nelastic continuum and whose strength is proportional to sliding rate. This rate\ndependence may correspond to a viscously deforming shear zone or the\nlinearization of a non-linear, rate-dependent fault strength. We examine the\nresponse of such a fault to external forcing, such as local increases in shear\nstress or pore fluid pressure. We show that the slip and slip rate are governed\nby a type of diffusion equation, the solution of which is found using a Green's\nfunction approach. We derive the long-time, self-similar asymptotic expansion\nfor slip or slip rate, which depend on both time $t$ and a similarity\ncoordinate $\\eta=x/t$, where $x$ denotes fault position. The similarity\ncoordinate shows a departure from classical diffusion and is owed to the\nnon-local nature of elastic interaction among points on an interface between\nelastic half-spaces.

Data Fusion\ntechniques deal with this point proposing method to combine and exploit\ncomplementarity among the different data sensors. Considering optical Very High\nSpatial Resolution (VHSR) images, satellites obtain both Multi Spectral (MS)\nand panchro- matic (PAN) images at different spatial resolution. VHSR images\nare extensively exploited to produce land cover maps to deal with agricultural,\necological, and socioeconomic issues as well as assessing ecosystem status,\nmonitoring biodiversity and provid- ing inputs to conceive food risk monitoring\nsystems.

This framework allows\nthe number of moment conditions to grow with the sample size, possibly at\nexponential rates. Our main motivating application is subvector inference,\ni.e., inference on a single component of the partially identified parameter\nvector associated with a treatment effect or a policy variable of interest.\n  Our inference method compares a MinMax test statistic (minimum over\nparameters satisfying $H_0$ and maximum over moment inequalities) against\ncritical values that are based on bootstrap approximations or analytical\nbounds. We show that this method controls asymptotic size uniformly over a\nlarge class of data generating processes despite the partially identified many\nmoment inequality setting. The finite sample analysis allows us to obtain\nexplicit rates of convergence on the size control. Our results are based on\ncombining non-asymptotic approximations and new high-dimensional central limit\ntheorems for the MinMax of the components of random matrices. Unlike the\nprevious literature on functional inference in partially identified models, our\nresults do not rely on weak convergence results based on Donsker's class\nassumptions and, in fact, our test statistic may not even converge in\ndistribution. Our bootstrap approximation requires the choice of a tuning\nparameter sequence that can avoid the excessive concentration of our test\nstatistic. To this end, we propose an asymptotically valid data-driven method\nto select this tuning parameter sequence. This method generalizes the selection\nof tuning parameter sequences to problems outside the Donsker's class\nassumptions and may also be of independent interest.

Colder flow, bled from the high-pressure compressor, is\noften purged at the trailing edge to cool the thin blade edges, affecting the\nflow behavior and modulating the intensity and angle of the shock waves system.\nHowever, this purge flow can sometimes generate non-symmetrical configurations\ndue to a pressure difference that is provoked by the injected flow.

Time-reversal symmetry and the kinematic constraints\nof scattering in two dimensions (2D) ensure that inversion-odd and\ninversion-even distortions of the quasiparticle distribution relax with\nparametrically different rates at low temperature. This entails the surprising\nresult that at lowest temperatures the conductance of very long samples tends\nto the noninteracting, ballistic conductance, despite the relaxation of the\nquasiparticle distribution to a drifting equilibrium.

In this paper, a fast dynamic\nvisual tracking algorithm combining CNN based MDNet(Multi-Domain Network) and\nRoIAlign was developed. The major problem of MDNet also lies in the time\nefficiency. Considering the computational complexity of MDNet is mainly caused\nby the large amount of convolution operations and fine-tuning of the network\nduring tracking, a RoIPool layer which could conduct the convolution over the\nwhole image instead of each RoI is added to accelerate the convolution and a\nnew strategy of fine-tuning the fully-connected layers is used to accelerate\nthe update. With RoIPool employed, the computation speed has been increased but\nthe tracking precision has dropped simultaneously. RoIPool could lose some\npositioning precision because it can not handle locations represented by\nfloating numbers. So RoIAlign, instead of RoIPool, which can process floating\nnumbers of locations by bilinear interpolation has been added to the network.\nThe results show the target localization precision has been improved and it\nhardly increases the computational cost.

To improve robustness and accuracy of detection, especially, in certain\ncritical-care scenarios, the use of additional physiological signals such as\narterial blood pressure (BP) has recently been suggested. There, estimation of\nheartbeat location requires information fusion from multiple signals. However,\nreported efforts in this direction often obtain multimodal estimates somewhat\nindirectly, by voting among separately obtained signal-specific intermediate\nestimates. In contrast, we propose to directly fuse information from multiple\nsignals without requiring intermediate estimates, and thence estimate heartbeat\nlocation in a robust manner. Method: We propose as a heartbeat detector, a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) that learns fused features from multiple\nphysiological signals. This method eliminates the need for hand-picked\nsignal-specific features and ad hoc fusion schemes. Further, being data-driven,\nthe same algorithm learns suitable features from arbitrary set of signals.\nResults: Using ECG and BP signals of PhysioNet 2014 Challenge database, we\nobtained a score of 94%.

Despite the unexpected model results, the method\nproposed here, which combines poroelastic modeling and periodic structures\nsemi-analytically, can be promising in broadband sound modulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 03:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 02:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

It is shown in this paper that a mathematical form of\nnonlinearity of a PN-junction diode resembles the nonlinear response of\nelectric polarization of a dielectric medium to the electric field.\nNonlinearity of a PN-junction can be expressed in a series of successively\nincreasing orders of the nonlinearity. For a PN-junction diode, higher order\nnonlinear terms become significant as a voltage across the diode is increased.\nIn this paper, a gradual emergence of a nonlinear regime with the amplitude of\na sinusoidal voltage is presented. Higher order harmonics are produced by\nutilizing the nonlinearity of a single PN-junction diode. An experimental\nrealization of a frequency comb with the highest frequency up to the twentieth\nharmonics is also presented. In addition, in the same circuit by making the\nnonlinearity significant up to the second order, an experiment on generation of\nthe sum and difference of frequencies is realized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 06:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}
