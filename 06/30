We review the\nmagnetospheric radius calculations in the so-called magnetically threaded disk\nmodel, comparing the simplified approach originally proposed by Ghosh & Lamb\n(1979) with the revised version proposed by Wang (1987), Wang (1995), and Wang\n(1997). We show that for a given set of fixed parameters (assuming also a\ncomparable screening factor of the neutron star magnetic field by the currents\ninduced on the disk surface) the revised magnetically threaded disk model\npredicts a magnetospheric radius that is significantly smaller than that\nderived from the Ghosh & Lamb (1979) treatment.

To illustrate the relevance of these calculations, we\nconsider, as an example, the case of the transitional pulsars. During the\nso-called \"high mode\" of their sub-luminous accretion disk state, these sources\nhave shown X-ray pulsations interpreted as due to accretion at an unprecedented\nlow luminosity level compared to other neutron stars in X-ray binaries. In the\ncontext of the magnetic threaded disk model, we show that accretion at\nluminosities of $\\sim$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (and thus accretion-driven X-ray\npulsations) can be more easily explained when the prescription of the\nmagnetospheric radius provided by Wang (1997) is used.

The ability to control their chemical, optical, or electronic\nfeatures by controlling their size and shape explains why these materials are\nso widely employed. Nevertheless, altering some of these properties may also\nlead to some undesired side effects, one of which is an increase in optical\nscattering upon concentration. Here, we address this strong scattering issue in\nfilms made of colloids with high surface roughness. We focus on raspberry type\npolymeric particles made of a spherical polystyrene core decorated by small\nhemispherical domains of acrylate. Owing to their surface charge and model\nroughness, aqueous dispersions of these particles display an unusual stability\nagainst aggregation. Under certain angles, their solid films display a\nbrilliant red color due to Bragg scattering but otherwise appear completely\nwhite on account of`strong scattering. To suppress the scattering and induce\ntransparency, we prepared films by hybridizing them either with\noppositely-charged PS-particles that fit the length-scale of the raspberry\nroughness or with quantum dots. We report that the smaller PS-particles prevent\nraspberry particle aggregation in solid films and suppress scattering by\ndecreasing the spatial variation of the refractive index. We believe that the\nresults presented here provide a simple strategy to suppress strong scattering\nof rough particles and allow for their utilization in optical coatings,\ncosmetics, or photonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

Their morphologies vary from small associations of stars to\nenormous stellar complexes. Being associated with star-forming regions of\nvarious sizes, they trace the regions where stars form at various scales, from\ncompact clusters to whole galactic disks. They have been, thus, the focus of\nseveral studies with special interest on their demographics, classification,\nand structural morphology. Their surveys demonstrate that the clear distinction\nof these systems into well-defined classes is not straightforward, due to their\nlow densities, asymmetric shapes and variety in structural parameters. Unbound\nstellar structures follow a hierarchical clustering pattern up to the scale of\na whole star-forming galaxy. This structural pattern, which is usually\ncharacterized as self-similar or fractal, appears to be identical to that of\nstar-forming giant molecular clouds and interstellar gas, driven mainly by\nturbulence cascade. In this short review, I make a concise compilation of our\nunderstanding of unbound young stellar systems across various environments in\nthe local universe, as it is developed during the last 60 years. I present a\nfactual assessment of the clustering behavior of star formation, as revealed\nfrom the assembling pattern of stars across loose stellar structures and its\nrelation to the interstellar medium and the environmental conditions. I also\nprovide a consistent account of the processes that possibly play important role\nin the formation of unbound stellar systems, compiled from both theoretical and\nobservational investigations on the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 17:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-02"}

The hashes are used to reduce the counting problem into\nmany separate discrete optimization problems. The optimization problems then\ncan be solved by an NP-oracle such as commercial SAT solvers or integer linear\nprogramming (ILP) solvers. In particular, Ermon et al. showed that if the\ndomain of integration is $\\{0,1\\}^n$ then it is possible to obtain a solution\nwithin a factor of $16$ of the optimal (a 16-approximation) by this technique.\n  In many crucial counting tasks, such as computation of partition function of\nferromagnetic Potts model, the domain of integration is naturally $\\{0,1,\\dots,\nq-1\\}^n, q>2$, the hypergrid. The straightforward extension of Ermon et al.'s\nmethod allows a $q^2$-approximation for this problem. For large values of $q$,\nthis is undesirable. In this paper, we show an improved technique to obtain an\napproximation factor of $4+O(1/q^2)$ to this problem.

Results: PDS 70 b is most likely orbiting the star on a\ncircular and disk coplanar orbit at ~22 au inside the gap of the disk. We find\na range of models that can describe the spectrophotometric data reasonably well\nin the temperature range between 1000-1600 K and log(g) no larger than 3.5 dex.\nThe planet radius covers a relatively large range between 1.4 and 3.7 R_jupiter\nwith the larger radii being higher than expected from planet evolution models\nfor the age of the planet of 5.4 Myr. Conclusions: This study provides a\ncomprehensive dataset on the orbital motion of PDS 70 b, indicating a circular\norbit and a motion coplanar with the disk. The first detailed spectral energy\ndistribution of PDS 70 b indicates a temperature typical for young giant\nplanets. The detailed atmospheric analysis indicates that a circumplanetary\ndisk may contribute to the total planet flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 17:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 14:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

However, their\ndetection is sensitive to radiative transfer effects that depend on local\nastrophysical conditions. Thus, modeling the bulk properties of this galaxy\npopulation remains challenging for theoretical models. Here we develop a\nphysically-motivated scheme to predict LAEs in cosmological simulations. The\nescape of Ly{\\alpha} photons is computed using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode which outputs a Ly{\\alpha} escape fraction. To speed-up the process of\nassigning escape fractions to individual galaxies, we employ fitting formulae\nthat approximate the full Monte Carlo results within an accuracy of 10% for a\nbroad range of column densities, gas metallicities and gas bulk velocities. We\napply our methodology to the semi-analytical model GALFORM on a large N-body\nsimulation. The Ly{\\alpha} photons escape through an outflowing neutral gas\nmedium, implemented assuming different geometries. This results in different\npredictions for the typical column density and outflow velocities of the LAE\npopulation. To understand the impact of radiative transfer on our predictions,\nwe contrast our models against a simple abundance matching assignment. Our full\nmodels populate LAEs in less massive haloes than what is obtained with\nabundance matching. Overall, radiative transfer effects result in better\nagreement when confronting the properties of LAEs against observational\nmeasurements. This suggest that incorporating the effects of Ly{\\alpha}\nradiative transfer in the analysis of this galaxy population, including their\nclustering, can be important for obtaining an unbiased interpretation of future\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Its main goal is to complete\ntheir TTV curves, as the Kepler telescope no longer observes the original\nKepler field. Combining Kepler and new ground-based transit data we improve the\nmodelling of these systems. To this end, we have developed a photodynamical\nmodel, and we demonstrate its performance using the Kepler-9 system as an\nexample. Our comprehensive analysis combines the numerical integration of the\nsystem's dynamics over the time span of the observations along with the transit\nlight curve model. This model is coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithm, allowing the exploration of the model parameter space. Applied to\nthe Kepler-9 long cadence data, short cadence data and 13 new transit\nobservations collected by KOINet between the years 2014 to 2017, our modelling\nprovides well constrained predictions for the next transits and the system's\nparameters.

Our analysis reveals that Kepler-9c will stop transiting in about\n30 years. This results from strong dynamical interactions between Kepler-9b and\n9c, near 2:1 resonance, that leads to a periodic change in inclination. Over\nthe next 30 years the inclination of Kepler-9c (-9b) will decrease (increase)\nslowly. This should be measurable by a substantial decrease (increase) in the\ntransit duration, in as soon as a few years' time. Observations that contradict\nthis prediction might indicate the presence of additional objects. If this\nprediction proves true, this behaviour opens up a unique chance to scan the\ndifferent latitudes of a star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

In order to extract information of the\ndistance-redshift relation, we cross-correlate weak lensing, which is an\nunbiased tracer of matter distribution in the Universe, with the projected\nnumber density of gravitational wave sources. For weak lensing, we employ\ntomography technique to efficiently obtain information of large-scale\nstructures at wide ranges of redshifts. Making use of the cross-correlations\nalong with the auto-correlations, we present forecast of constraints on four\ncosmological parameters, i.e., Hubble parameter, matter density, the equation\nof state parameter of dark energy, and the amplitude of matter fluctuation. To\nfully explore the ability of cross-correlations, which require large\noverlapping sky coverage, we consider the specific case with the upcoming\nsurveys by \\textit{Euclid} for weak lensing and Einstein Telescope for standard\nsirens. We show that cosmological parameters can be tightly constrained solely\nby these auto- and cross-correlations of standard sirens and weak lensing.

Data shuffling is often\nconsidered as one of the most significant bottlenecks in such systems due to\nthe heavy communication load. Under a master-worker architecture (where a\nmaster has access to the entire dataset and only communication between the\nmaster and the workers is allowed) coding has been recently proved to\nconsiderably reduce the communication load. This work considers a different\ncommunication paradigm referred to as decentralized data shuffling, where\nworkers are allowed to communicate with one another via a shared link. The\ndecentralized data shuffling problem has two phases: workers communicate with\neach other during the data shuffling phase, and then workers update their\nstored content during the storage phase. The main challenge is to derive novel\nconverse bounds and achievable schemes for decentralized data shuffling by\nconsidering the asymmetry of the workers' storages (i.e., workers are\nconstrained to store different files in their storages based on the problem\nsetting), in order to characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. For\nthe case of uncoded storage (i.e., each worker directly stores a subset of bits\nof the dataset), this paper proposes converse and achievable bounds (based on\ndistributed interference alignment and distributed clique-covering strategies)\nthat are within a factor of 3/2 of one another. The proposed schemes are also\nexactly optimal under the constraint of uncoded storage for either large\nstorage size or at most four workers in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 20:03:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 16:52:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 08:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 13:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Though the status of large nodules can be easily diagnosed by fine\nneedle biopsy or bronchoscopy, small nodules are often difficult to classify on\ncomputed tomography (CT). Recent works have shown that shape analysis of lung\nnodules can be used to differentiate benign lesions from malignant ones, though\nexisting methods are limited in their sensitivity and specificity. In this work\nwe introduced a new 3D shape analysis within the framework of differential\ngeometry to calculate the Wasserstein distance between benign and malignant\nlung nodules to derive an accurate classification scheme. The Wasserstein\ndistance between the nodules is calculated based on our new spherical optimal\nmass transport, this new algorithm works directly on sphere by using spherical\nmetric, which is much more accurate and efficient than previous methods. In the\nprocess of deformation, the area-distortion factor gives a probability measure\non the unit sphere, which forms the Wasserstein space. From known cases of\nbenign and malignant lung nodules, we can calculate a unique optimal mass\ntransport map between their correspondingly deformed Wasserstein spaces. This\ntransportation cost defines the Wasserstein distance between them and can be\nused to classify new lung nodules into either the benign or malignant class. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes Wasserstein\ndistance for lung nodule classification. The advantages of Wasserstein distance\nare it is invariant under rigid motions and scalings, thus it intrinsically\nmeasures shape distance even when the underlying shapes are of high complexity,\nmaking it well suited to classify lung nodules as they have different sizes,\norientations, and appearances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 00:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

In fact, it was recently realized that memcomputing, and in\nparticular its digital (hence scalable) version, when simulated on a classical\nmachine provides a significant speed-up over state-of-the-art algorithms on a\nvariety of non-convex problems. Here, we stress-test the capabilities of this\napproach on finding approximate solutions to hard combinatorial optimization\nproblems. These fall into a class which is known to require exponentially\ngrowing resources in the worst cases, even to generate approximations. We\nrecently showed that in a region where state of the art algorithms demonstrate\nthis exponential growth, simulations of digital memcomputing machines performed\nusing the Falcon$^\\copyright$ simulator of MemComputing, Inc. only require time\nand memory resources that scale linearly. These results are extended in a\nstress-test up to $64\\times10^6$ variables (corresponding to about 1 billion\nliterals), namely the largest case that we could fit on a single node with 128\nGB of DRAM. Since memcomputing can be applied to a wide variety of optimization\nproblems, this stress test shows the considerable advantage of\nnon-combinatorial, physics-inspired approaches over standard combinatorial\nones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 02:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 02:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

The proposed network takes a sequence\nof consecutive spectrogram time-frames as input and maps it to two outputs in\nparallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as\na multi-label classification task on each time-frame producing temporal\nactivity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is\nperformed by estimating the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the\ndirection-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output\nregression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with\nrespective sound event labels and further track this association with respect\nto time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component\nof the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby\navoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is\nevaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with\ndifferent overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant and real-life\nscenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation,\nand one SELD baselines. The results show that the proposed method is generic\nand applicable to any array structures, robust to unseen DOA values,\nreverberation, and low SNR scenarios. The proposed method achieved a\nconsistently higher recall of the estimated number of DOAs across datasets in\ncomparison to the best baseline.

As their business activities expand rapidly, many service\ncompanies struggle to maintain customer's satisfaction due to sluggish service\nresponse caused by resource shortages. Anticipating resource shortages and\nproffering solutions before they happen is an effective way of reducing the\nadverse effect on operations. However, this proactive approach is very\nexpensive in terms of capacity and labor costs. Many companies fall into\nproductivity conundrum as they fail to find sufficient strong arguments to\njustify the cost of a new technology yet cannot afford not to invest in new\ntechnologies to match up with competitors. The question is whether there is an\ninnovative solution to maximally utilize available resources and drastically\nreduce the effect that the shortages of resources may cause yet achieving high\nlevel of service quality at a low cost.

The feature vectors constructed by fractional scattering\ncoefficients are usually used for signal classification.

Firstly, the FrScatNet extracts feature vectors from\npatches of the original histological images under different orders.

We\nfound that a function consisting of a power-law divided by an exponential fit\nthe distributions of most pulsars better than either log-normal or power-law\nfunctions.

However, these AL methods\ncause the detectors to ignore the remaining majority samples (i.e., those with\nlow uncertainty or high prediction confidence). In this work, by developing a\nprincipled active sample mining (ASM) framework, we demonstrate that\ncost-effectively mining samples from these unlabeled majority data is key to\ntraining more powerful object detectors while minimizing user effort.\nSpecifically, our ASM framework involves a switchable sample selection\nmechanism for determining whether an unlabeled sample should be manually\nannotated via AL or automatically pseudo-labeled via a novel self-learning\nprocess. The proposed process can be compatible with mini-batch based training\n(i.e., using a batch of unlabeled or partially labeled data as a one-time\ninput) for object detection. In addition, a few samples with low-confidence\npredictions are selected and annotated via AL.

This is an important class\nof uncertainty sets widely used in practice where we can specify a budget on\nthe adversarial deviations of the uncertain parameters from the nominal values\nto adjust the level of conservatism. The two-stage adjustable robust\noptimization problem is hard to approximate within a factor better than $\\Omega\n\\left( \\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n} \\right)$ even for budget of uncertainty sets\nand fixed non-negative recourse where $n$ is the number of decision variables.\nAffine policies, where the second-stage decisions are constrained to be an\naffine function of the uncertain parameters, provide a tractable approximation\nfor the problem and have been observed to exhibit good empirical performance.\nWe show that affine policies give an $O\\left( \\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n}\n\\right)$-approximation for the two-stage adjustable robust problem with fixed\nnon-negative recourse for budgeted uncertainty sets. This matches the hardness\nof approximation and therefore, surprisingly affine policies provide an optimal\napproximation for the problem (up to a constant factor).

In the developed approach, the Hamiltonian is expressed\nthrough the ket-bra products of collective (photon + cavities + QEs) states.\nConsequently, the S-matrix of input-output problems is determined exactly by\nthe Mahaux-Weidenm\\\"uller formula, which dramatically simplifies the analysis\nof complex cavity QED systems. First, this approach is illustrated for the\nproblem of propagation of a photon resonantly interacting with N two-level QEs\narbitrary distributed inside the optical cavity. Solution of this problem\nmanifests the effect of cumulative action of QEs previously known for special\ncases. Can a similar cumulative action of QEs enhance the inelastic resonant\ntransmission of a single photon? We solve this problem for the case of an\noptical cavity having two modes resonantly coupled to electronic transitions of\nN three-level QEs. It is shown that the described structure is the simplest\nrealistic structure which enables the down-conversion of the single photon\nfrequency with the amplitude approaching unity in the absence of the external\ndriving field and for sufficiently small cavity losses and QE dissipation.\nOverall, the simplicity and generality of the developed approach suggest a\npractical way to identify and describe new phenomena in cavity QED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 12:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 09:51:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 16:58:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 15:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 15:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

Most of the total\ngas PDFs from the central region to the edge of the star-forming disk are\nwell-fitted by log-normal functions whose width decreases radially outwards.\nBecause the HI velocity dispersion is approximately constant across the disk,\nthe decrease of the PDF width is consistent with a lower Mach number for the\nturbulent ISM at large galactocentric radii where a higher fraction of HI is in\nthe warm phase.

The molecular gas PDFs do not show strong deviations from\nlog-normal functions in the central region where molecular fractions are high.\nHere the high pressure and rate of star formation shapes the PDF as a\nlog-normal function dispersing self-gravitating complexes with intense feedback\nat all column densities that are spatially resolved.

In particular, we propose a scalar field\nLagrangian $\\mathcal L_1$ for matter with the introduction of a Lagrange\nmultiplier as constraint. We also add a symmetry breaking effective potential\naccounting for the classical cosmological constant problem, by adding a second\nLagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_2$. Investigating the Noether current due to the shift\nsymmetry on the scalar field, $\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi+c^0$, we show that\n$\\mathcal{L}_1$ turns out to be independent from the scalar field $\\varphi$.\nFurther we find that a positive Helmotz free-energy naturally leads to a\nnegative pressure without introducing by hand any dark energy term. To face out\nthe fine-tuning problem, we investigate two phases: before and after transition\ndue to the symmetry breaking. We propose that during transition dark matter\ncancels out the quantum field vacuum energy effects. This process leads to a\nnegative and constant pressure whose magnitude is determined by baryons only.\nThe numerical bounds over the pressure and matter densities are in agreement\nwith current observations, alleviating the coincidence problem. Finally\nassuming a thermal equilibrium between the bath and our effective fluid, we\nestimate the mass of the dark matter candidate. Our numerical outcomes seem to\nbe compatible with recent predictions on WIMP masses, for fixed spin and\ntemperature. In particular, we predict possible candidates whose masses span in\nthe range $0.5-1.7$ TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 14:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 11:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

There are\nvarious kinds of fuzzers with different fuzzing strategies, and most of them\nperform well on their targets. However, in industry practice and empirical\nstudy, the performance and generalization ability of those well-designed\nfuzzing strategies are challenged by the complexity and diversity of real-world\napplications.\n  In this paper, inspired by the idea of ensemble learning, we first propose an\nensemble fuzzing approach EnFuzz, that integrates multiple fuzzing strategies\nto obtain better performance and generalization ability than that of any\nconstituent fuzzer alone. First, we define the diversity of the base fuzzers\nand choose those most recent and well-designed fuzzers as base fuzzers.

As the difference between different subcategories is subtle,\ndoctors often refer to slides from different staining methods to make\ndecisions. However, creating correspondence across various stains is\nlabor-intensive, bringing major difficulties in collecting data and training a\nvision-based algorithm to assist nephropathy diagnosis. This paper provides an\nalternative solution for integrating multi-stained visual cues for glomerulus\nclassification. Our approach, named generator-to-classifier (G2C), is a\ntwo-stage framework. Given an input image from a specified stain, several\ngenerators are first applied to estimate its appearances in other staining\nmethods, and a classifier follows to combine visual cues from different stains\nfor prediction (whether it is pathological, or which type of pathology it has).\nWe optimize these two stages in a joint manner. To provide a reasonable\ninitialization, we pre-train the generators in an unlabeled reference set under\nan unpaired image-to-image translation task, and then fine-tune them together\nwith the classifier. We conduct experiments on a glomerulus type classification\ndataset collected by ourselves (there are no publicly available datasets for\nthis purpose).

I\nconsider how such a structure could relate to space and space-time, and the\nimplications of the existence of this structure for quantum theory. I compare\nspace and space-time to other spaces used in physics, such as configuration\nspace, phase space, and Hilbert space. I support the 'property view' of space,\nopposing both the traditional views of space and space-time, substantivalism\nand relationism. I argue that configuration space has a special status in the\nmicroscopic world similar to the status of position space in the macroscopic\nworld. The prespace structure is compared with a computational system, in\nparticular to a cellular automaton, in which space and all physical quantities\nare broken into discrete units. One way open for a prespace metaphysics can be\nfound if physics is made fully discrete. I suggest as a heuristic principle\nthat the physical laws of our world are such that the computational cost of\nimplementing those laws on an arbitrary computational system is minimized. I\ndiscuss the 'measurement problem' of quantum mechanics. Considering how quantum\ntheory could be made fully discrete leads naturally to a suggestion of how\nstandard linear quantum mechanics could be modified to give a solution to the\nmeasurement problem, calling this model Critical Complexity Quantum Mechanics\n(CCQM). I compare CCQM with some other proposed solutions to the measurement\nproblem, in particular, the spontaneous localization model of Ghirardi, Rimini,\nand Weber. Finally, I argue that the measure of the complexity of quantum\nmechanical states introduced in CCQM also provides a new definition of entropy\nfor quantum mechanics, and suggests an objective foundation for statistical\nmechanics, thermodynamics, and the arrow of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 13:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

It is observed that the\ncommonly used fundamental solution is only valid for good conductors since the\ncapacitive effect of the considered medium is always neglected. By the use of\nthe well-known Lorentz gauge condition a fundamental solution which\nincorporates the phase as well as the attenuation transmission coefficients is\nderived by the authors. Next, a model is developed using this proposed\nfundamental solution for modelling a coating layer of a buried pipeline.\nSubsequently, a model of a buried coated pipeline in close proximity to a high\nvoltage power line is developed and numerically implemented. Finally, the model\nis used to simulate two configurations in order the verify the proposed general\nfundamental solution of the boundary element method for electromagnetic field\nproblems. Hereby, its validity is proven and it is shown that the generalized\nsolution and related model can be used for industrial applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 10:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}
