SDs are among the most important sources of evolution, a common\ncause of genomic structural variation, and several are associated with diseases\nof genomic origin. Despite their functional importance, SDs present one of the\nmajor hurdles for de novo genome assembly due to the ambiguity they cause in\nbuilding and traversing both state-of-the-art overlap-layout-consensus and de\nBruijn graphs. This causes SD regions to be misassembled, collapsed into a\nunique representation, or completely missing from assembled reference genomes\nfor various organisms. In turn, this missing or incorrect information limits\nour ability to fully understand the evolution and the architecture of the\ngenomes. Despite the essential need to accurately characterize SDs in\nassemblies, there is only one tool that has been developed for this purpose,\ncalled Whole Genome Assembly Comparison (WGAC). WGAC is comprised of several\nsteps that employ different tools and custom scripts, which makes it difficult\nand time consuming to use. Thus there is still a need for algorithms to\ncharacterize within-assembly SDs quickly, accurately, and in a user friendly\nmanner.\n  Here we introduce a SEgmental Duplication Evaluation Framework (SEDEF) to\nrapidly detect SDs through sophisticated filtering strategies based on Jaccard\nsimilarity and local chaining. We show that SEDEF accurately detects SDs while\nmaintaining substantial speed up over WGAC that translates into practical run\ntimes of minutes instead of weeks. Notably, our algorithm captures up to 25%\npairwise error between segments, where previous studies focused on only 10%,\nallowing us to more deeply track the evolutionary history of the genome.\n  SEDEF is available at https://github.com/vpc-ccg/sedef\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 17:03:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 14:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

The\nhigh-lying magnetic structure became unstable and erupted first, appearing as\nan expanding hot channel seen at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths. About 12\nminutes later, the low-lying structure also started to erupt and moved at an\neven faster speed compared to the high-lying one. As a result, the two erupting\nstructures interacted and merged with each other, appearing as a single coronal\nmass ejection in the outer corona.

Scale-free networks may provide an explanation for\nthe robustness observed in certain physical and biological phenomena, since the\npresence of a few highly connected hub nodes and a large number of small-\ndegree nodes may provide alternate paths between any two nodes on average --\nsuch robustness has been suggested in studies of metabolic networks, gene\ninteraction networks and protein folding. A theoretical justification for why\nbiological networks are often found to be scale-free may lie in the well-known\nfact that expanding networks in which new nodes are preferentially attached to\nhighly connected nodes tend to be scale-free. In this paper, we provide the\nfirst efficient algorithm to compute the connectivity density function for the\nensemble of all secondary structures of a user-specified length, and show both\nby computational and theoretical arguments that preferential attachment holds\nwhen expanding the network from length n to length n + 1 structures.

Many\nmethods have been proposed to infer networks from gene expression data but have\nbeen hampered by problems such as low sample size, inaccurate constraints, and\nincomplete characterizations of regulatory dynamics. Since expression\nregulation is dynamic, time-course data can be used to infer causality, but\nthese datasets tend to be short or sparsely sampled. In addition, temporal\nmethods typically assume that the expression of a gene at a time point depends\non the expression of other genes at only the immediately preceding time point,\nwhile other methods include additional time points without any constraints to\naccount for their temporal distance.

However,\nthere is still a lack of consensus on the theoretical model explaining such\norder, since its second nearest neighbor (NN) and long-range third NN magnetic\ninteractions are highly unclear. By properly taking into account the orbital\nmoments, achieved through constraining their directions in the first-principles\ncalculations, we obtain that the relative angle between orbital and spin\nmoments is fairly small and in the order of several degrees, which thus\nvalidates the Jeff=1/2 state in Na2IrO3. Surprisingly, we find that the\nlong-range third NN Heisenberg interactions are sizable whereas the second NN\nmagnetic interactions are negligible. Using maximally localized Wannier\nfunctions, we show that the sizable long-range third NN Heisenberg interaction\nresults from the extended nature of the Jeff=1/2 state. Based on our study, we\npropose a minimal J1-K1-{\\Gamma}_1-J3 model in which the magnetic excitations\nhave an intensity peak at 5.6 meV, consistent with the inelastic neutron\nscattering experiment [Phys.

State of the art approaches to SLU use memory networks to encode\ncontext by processing multiple utterances from the dialogue at each turn,\nresulting in significant trade-offs between accuracy and computational\nefficiency. On the other hand, downstream components like the dialogue state\ntracker (DST) already keep track of the dialogue state, which can serve as a\nsummary of the dialogue history. In this work, we propose an efficient approach\nto encoding context from prior utterances for SLU. More specifically, our\narchitecture includes a separate recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoding\nmodule that accumulates dialogue context to guide the frame parsing sub-tasks\nand can be shared between SLU and DST. In our experiments, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach on dialogues from two domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2018 04:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

In this\nwork, we investigate the tuning of ferroelectricity of Ca$_3$Ti$_2$O$_7$ using\niso-valent substitutions on Ca-sites. Due to the size mismatch, larger/smaller\nalkaline earths prefer $A$'/$A$ sites respectively, allowing the possibility\nfor site-selective substitutions. Without extra carriers, such site-selected\niso-valent substitutions can significantly tune the TiO$_6$ octahedral rotation\nand tilting, and thus change the structure and polarization. Using the\nfirst-principles calculations, our study reveals that three substituted cases\n(Sr, Mg, Sr+Mg) show divergent physical behaviors.

An efficient way to reduce this complexity is to quantize the\nweight parameters and/or activations during training by approximating their\ndistributions with a limited entry codebook. For very low-precisions, such as\nbinary or ternary networks with 1-8-bit activations, the information loss from\nquantization leads to significant accuracy degradation due to large gradient\nmismatches between the forward and backward functions. In this paper, we\nintroduce a quantization method to reduce this loss by learning a symmetric\ncodebook for particular weight subgroups. These subgroups are determined based\non their locality in the weight matrix, such that the hardware simplicity of\nthe low-precision representations is preserved. Empirically, we show that\nsymmetric quantization can substantially improve accuracy for networks with\nextremely low-precision weights and activations.

Using functions\ncalled sensitivity kernels, we may image the underlying anomalies that cause\nmeasured shifts in travel times.

The main aim of this integration is to support service\ndelivery in real-time, failure recovery, and fault-awareness in an SFC context.\nFirstly, we present an architecture for Failure Recovery and Fault Prevention\ncalled FRFP; this is a multi-tier structure in which the real-time traffic\nflows pass through SDN-enabled switches to jointly decrease the network\nside-effects of flow rerouting and energy consumption of the Fog Nodes.

In this way, the energy consumption and the\nreliability of the selected paths are optimized, while the Quality of Service\nconstraints are met and the network congestion is minimized. In a reliability\ncontext, the focus of this work is on fault prevention; however, since we use a\nreallocation technique, the proposed scheme can be used as a failure recovery\nscheme.

Indeed, a major landmark that enables\nefficient hardware accelerators for deep networks is the recent advances from\nthe machine learning community that have demonstrated aggressively scaled deep\nbinary networks with state-of-the-art accuracies. In this paper, we demonstrate\nhow deep binary networks can be accelerated in modified von-Neumann machines by\nenabling binary convolutions within the SRAM array. In general, binary\nconvolutions consist of bit-wise XNOR followed by a population-count\n(popcount). We present a charge sharing XNOR and popcount operation in 10\ntransistor SRAM cells. We have employed multiple circuit techniques including\ndual-read-worldines (Dual-RWL) along with a dual-stage ADC that overcomes the\ninaccuracies of a low precision ADC, to achieve a fairly accurate popcount. In\naddition, a key highlight of the present work is the fact that we propose\nsectioning of the SRAM array by adding switches onto the read-bitlines, thereby\nachieving improved parallelism. This is beneficial for deep networks, where the\nkernel size grows and requires to be stored in multiple sub-banks. As such, one\nneeds to evaluate the partial popcount from multiple sub-banks and sum them up\nfor achieving the final popcount. For n-sections per sub-array, we can perform\nn convolutions within one particular sub-bank, thereby improving overall system\nthroughput as well as the energy efficiency. Our results at the array level\nshow that the energy consumption and delay per-operation was 1.914pJ and 45ns,\nrespectively.

Here we show that the infinite resistance\nsuperinsulating state, which emerges on the insulating side of the\nsuperconductor-insulator transition in superconducting films offers a\nrealization of confinement that allows for a direct experimental access. We\nfind that superinsulators realize a single-color version of quantum\nchromodynamics and establish the mapping of quarks onto Cooper pairs. We reveal\nthat the mechanism of superinsulation is the linear binding of Cooper pairs\ninto neutral \"mesons\" by electric strings. Our findings offer a powerful\nlaboratory for exploring and testing the fundamental implications of\nconfinement, asymptotic freedom, and related quantum chromodynamics phenomena\nvia desktop experiments on superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2018 21:09:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 14:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}
