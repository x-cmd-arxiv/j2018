This question can be\nphrased as a (multi-) manifold hypothesis. The identification of such intrinsic\nmultiscale features is a cornerstone of data analysis and representation and\nhas given rise to a large body of work on manifold learning. In this work, we\nreview key results on multi-scale data analysis and intrinsic dimension\nfollowed by the introduction of a heuristic, multiscale framework for testing\nthe multi-manifold hypothesis. Our method implements a hypothesis test on a set\nof spline-interpolated manifolds constructed from variance-based intrinsic\ndimensions.

Thus, the RMPE represents the net\ncontribution to $s_\\text{ex}$ due to spatial correlations involving three,\nfour, or more particles. A heuristic `ordering' criterion identifies the\nvanishing of the RMPE as an underlying signature of an impending structural or\nthermodynamic transition of the system from a less ordered to a more spatially\norganized condition (freezing is a typical example). Regardless of this, the\nknowledge of the RMPE is important to assess the impact of non-pair\nmultiparticle correlations on the entropy of the fluid.

However, it is often the\ncase that data are abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain\nadaptation deals with the challenge of adapting a model trained from a\ndata-rich source domain to perform well in a data-poor target domain. In\ngeneral, this requires learning plausible mappings between domains. CycleGAN is\na powerful framework that efficiently learns to map inputs from one domain to\nanother using adversarial training and a cycle-consistency constraint. However,\nthe conventional approach of enforcing cycle-consistency via reconstruction may\nbe overly restrictive in cases where one or more domains have limited training\ndata. In this paper, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model\nthat enforces the cycle-consistency constraint via an external task specific\nmodel, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant content as opposed to\nexact reconstruction. We explore digit classification in a low-resource setting\nin supervised, semi and unsupervised situation, as well as high resource\nunsupervised. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our\napproach improves absolute performance by 14% and 4% when adapting SVHN to\nMNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain.\nMoreover, using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still\noutperforms many high-resource unsupervised models.

Our approach improves absolute performance of speech\nrecognition by 2% for female speakers in the TIMIT dataset, where the majority\nof training samples are from male voices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2018 19:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 23:36:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 23:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 19:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

In particular, on-demand ridesharing services, which group\ntogether passengers with similar itineraries, are already operating in several\nmetropolitan areas. These services can be of significant social and\nenvironmental benefit, by reducing travel costs, road congestion and co2\nemissions. The deployment of autonomous cars in the near future will surely\nchange the way people are traveling. It is even more promising for a\nridesharing service, since it will be easier and cheaper for a company to\nhandle a fleet of autonomous cars that can serve the demands of different\npassengers.\n  We argue that user satisfaction should be the main objective when trying to\nfind the best assignment of passengers to vehicles and the determination of\ntheir routes.

In this\nwork, we analyse coordinated observations from \\textit{Hinode}/SOT and\n\\textit{IRIS} of a prominence/coronal rain loop-like structure at the limb of\nthe Sun. Cool and dense downflows and upflows are observed along the structure.\nA collision between a downward and an upward flow with an estimated energy flux\nof $10^{7}-10^{8}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ is observed to generate oscillatory\ntransverse perturbations of the strands with an estimated\n$\\approx40~$km~s$^{-1}$ total amplitude, and a short-lived brightening event\nwith the plasma temperature increasing to at least $10^{5}~$K.

We strongly emphasize\nthe consequences of the anisotropy. In particular, we demonstrate the crucial\nrole of the choice of the thin film's effective thickness compared with the\nparameters of the single sheet approach and therefore the computed properties\nof the 2D material under study. Indeed, if the isotropic thin film model with\nvery low thickness is similar to an anisotropic single sheet with no\nout-of-plane response, with larger thickness it matches with a single sheet\nwith isotropic susceptibility, in the reasonable small phase condition. We\nillustrate our conclusions on extensively studied experimental quantities such\nas transmittance, ellipsometry and optical contrast, and we discuss\nsimilarities and discrepancies reported in the literature when using single\nsheet or thin film models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2018 21:59:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 21:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

The main challenge is to devise\nrepresentations of atomic systems that are at the same time complete and\nconcise, so as to reduce the number of reference calculations that are needed\nto predict the properties of different types of materials reliably. This has\nled to a proliferation of alternative ways to convert an atomic structure into\nan input for a machine-learning model. We introduce an abstract definition of\nchemical environments that is based on a smoothed atomic density, using a\nbra-ket notation to emphasize basis set independence and to highlight the\nconnections with some popular choices of representations for describing atomic\nsystems. The correlations between the spatial distribution of atoms and their\nchemical identities are computed as inner products between these feature kets,\nwhich can be given an explicit representation in terms of the expansion of the\natom density on orthogonal basis functions, that is equivalent to the smooth\noverlap of atomic positions (SOAP) power spectrum, but also in real space,\ncorresponding to $n$-body correlations of the atom density.

The MAGIC observations were triggered by the optical flux\nobserved in Phase A, corresponding to the brightest ever reported state of the\nsource in the R-band. The comprehensive dataset collected is investigated in\norder to shed light on the mechanism of the broadband emission.\nMulti-wavelength light curves have been studied together with the broadband\nSpectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). The data set collected spans from radio,\noptical photometry and polarimetry, X-ray, high-energy (HE, 0.1 GeV < E < 100\nGeV) with \\textit{Fermi}-LAT to the very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) with\nMAGIC. The flaring state of Phase A was detected in all the energy bands,\nproviding for the first time a multi-wavelength sample of simultaneous data\nfrom the radio band to the VHE. In the constructed SED the\n\\textit{Swift}-XRT+\\textit{NuSTAR} data constrain the transition between the\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton components very accurately, while the second\npeak is constrained from 0.1~GeV to 600~GeV by \\textit{Fermi}+MAGIC data. The\nbroadband SED cannot be described with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton\nmodel as it severely underestimates the optical flux in order to reproduce the\nX-ray to $\\gamma$-ray data. Instead we use a two-zone model. The EVPA shows an\nunprecedented fast rotation.

In the present paper, how far the\nforward difference scheme for the time derivative in the wave equation\ninfluences the stability of the equation numerical solution, is particularly\ninvestigated. The stability analysis of the corresponding difference equation\ninvolving four schemes, namely Lax's, central, forward, and rearward\ndifferences, were carried out, and the resulting stability criteria were\ncompared.

Even though the system\nhas a semimetallic ground state, there are observable effects of excitonic\npairing at finite temperatures and/or finite energies, provided that the system\nis in proximity to the excitonic insulating transition. To determine the\nquantum critical behavior, we consider three potentially important\ninteractions, including the Yukawa coupling between Dirac fermions and the\nexcitonic order parameter fluctuation, the long-range Coulomb interaction, and\nthe disorder scattering. We employ the renormalization group technique to study\nhow these interactions affect quantum criticality and also how they influence\neach other. We first investigate the Yukawa coupling in the clean limit, and\nshow that it gives rise to typical non-Fermi liquid behavior. Adding random\nscalar potential to the system always turns such a non-Fermi liquid into a\ncompressible diffusive metal. In comparison, the non-Fermi liquid behavior is\nfurther enhanced by random vector potential, but is nearly unaffected by random\nmass. Incorporating the Coulomb interaction may change the results\nqualitatively. In particular, the non-Fermi liquid state is protected by the\nCoulomb interaction for weak random scalar potential, and it becomes a\ndiffusive metal only when random scalar potential becomes sufficiently strong.\nWhen random vector potential or random mass coexists with Yukawa coupling and\nCoulomb interaction, the system is a stable non-Fermi liquid state, with\nfermion velocities flowing to constants in the former case and being singularly\nrenormalized in the latter case. These quantum critical phenomena can be probed\nby measuring observable quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 03:41:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Most existing works focus on contagions where individuals' states\nare represented by {\\em binary} variables, and propagation takes place over a\nsingle isolated network. However, characterization of an individual's standing\non a given matter as a binary state might be overly simplistic as most of our\nopinions, feelings, and perceptions vary over more than two states. Also, most\nreal-world contagions take place over multiple networks (e.g., Twitter and\nFacebook) or involve {\\em multiplex} networks where individuals engage in\ndifferent {\\em types} of relationships (e.g., acquaintance, co-worker, family,\netc.). To this end, this paper studies {\\em multi-stage} complex contagions\nthat take place over multi-layer or multiplex networks. Under a linear\nthreshold based contagion model, we give analytic results for the probability\nand expected size of \\textit{global} cascades, i.e., cases where a randomly\nchosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a {\\em positive}\nfraction of the whole population. Analytic results are also confirmed and\nsupported by an extensive numerical study. In particular, we demonstrate how\nthe dynamics of complex contagions is affected by the extra weight exerted by\n\\textit{hyper-active} nodes and by the structural properties of the networks\ninvolved. Among other things, we reveal an interesting connection between the\nassortativity of a network and the impact of \\textit{hyper-active} nodes on the\ncascade size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 04:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 15:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Thus it is critical to control\ninterference among concurrent transmissions in a predictable manner to ensure\nthe required communication reliability. To this end, we propose a Unified\nCellular Scheduling (UCS) framework that, based on the Physical-Ratio-K (PRK)\ninterference model, schedules uplink, downlink, and D2D transmissions in a\nunified manner to ensure predictable communication reliability while maximizing\nchannel spatial reuse. UCS also provides a simple, effective approach to mode\nselection that maximizes the communication capacity for each involved\ncommunication pair.

In the detection phase, the classifier is then employed to\ngenerate a quantum state whose amplitudes encode the responses of all the\ncandidate image patches.

More generally, we can answer this\nfor the images of $A$ and $B$ under affine transformations. Next, we show how\nto $\\varepsilon$-approximate the Minkowski sum of two given polytopes defined\nas the intersection of $n$ halfspaces in $O(n \\log(1/\\varepsilon) +\n1/\\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2 + \\alpha})$ time, for any constant $\\alpha > 0$.\nFinally, we present a surprising impact of these results to a well studied\nproblem that considers a single convex body. We show how to\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate the width of a set of $n$ points in $O(n\n\\log(1/\\varepsilon) + 1/\\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2 + \\alpha})$ time, for any constant\n$\\alpha > 0$, a major improvement over the previous bound of roughly $O(n +\n1/\\varepsilon^{d-1})$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 06:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

In this work,\nwe investigate how to unify rich professional knowledge with deep neural\nnetwork architectures and propose a Knowledge-Embedded Representation Learning\n(KERL) framework for handling the problem of fine-grained image recognition.\nSpecifically, we organize the rich visual concepts in the form of knowledge\ngraph and employ a Gated Graph Neural Network to propagate node message through\nthe graph for generating the knowledge representation.

The underlying biophysical mechanisms, however, are not\nwell understood. Reducing the sharpness of the action potential onset can\nimpair ultrafast population encoding, but it is not clear whether a sharp\naction potential onset is sufficient for ultrafast population encoding. One\nhypothesis proposes that the sharp action potential onset is caused by the\nelectrotonic separation of the site of action potential initiation from the\nsoma, and that this spatial separation also results in ultrafast population\nencoding. Here we examined this hypothesis by studying the linear response\nproperties of model neurons with a defined initiation site. We find that\nplacing the initiation site at different axonal positions has only a weak\nimpact on the linear response function of the model. It fails to generate the\nultrafast response and high bandwidth that is observed in cortical neurons.\nFurthermore, the high frequency regime of the linear response function of this\nmodel is insensitive to correlation times of the input current contradicting\nempirical evidence. When we increase the voltage sensitivity of sodium channels\nat the initiation site, the two empirically observed phenomena can be\nrecovered. We provide an explanation for the dissociation of sharp action\npotential onset and ultrafast response. By investigating varying soma sizes, we\nfurthermore highlight the effect of neuron morphology on the linear response.\nOur results show that a sharp onset of action potentials is not sufficient for\nthe ultrafast response. In the light of recent reports of activity-dependent\nrepositioning of the axon initial segment, our study predicts that a more\ndistal initiation site can lead to an increased sharpness of the somatic\nwaveform but it does not affect the linear response of a population of neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 08:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 09:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The\ninformation about the size of the source emerges via the neutrino equivalent of\nintensity interferometry originally used by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss with\nphotons to measure the radii of stars. However the analytic demonstration of\nneutrino intensity interferometry with supernova neutrinos made a number of\napproximations: that the two neutrinos had equal energies, the neutrinos were\nemitted at simultaneous times from two points and were detected simultaneously\nat two detection points that formed a plane with the emission points. These\napproximations need to be relaxed in order to better determine the feasibility\nof neutrino intensity interferometry for supernovae neutrinos in a more\nrealistic scenario. In this paper we further investigate the feasibility of\nintensity interferometry for supernova neutrinos by relaxing all the\napproximations made in the earlier study.

This\nreductionist perspective can be contrasted with the view that as species have\nto fit in the surrounding system, the system itself exerts selection pressure\non the evolutionary pathways of the species. This interplay of bottom-up and\ntop-down control in the development and growth of ecological systems has long\nbeen discussed, however empirical ecosystem data is scarce and a comprehensive\nmathematical framework is lacking. We present a way of quantifying the relative\nweight of natural selection and coadaptation grounded in information theory, to\nassess the relative role of bottom-up and top-down control in the evolution of\necological systems, and analyse the information transfer in an individual based\nstochastic complex systems model, the Tangled Nature Model of evolutionary\necology. We show that ecological communities evolve from mainly bottom-up\ncontrolled early-successional systems to more strongly top-down controlled\nlate-successional systems, as coadaptation progresses.

In this study, we neglect an effect of magnetic fields, under which the\nshear oscillations can be damped by the magnetic interaction. First, by\nidentifying the low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in\nthe soft-gamma repeaters (SGRs) as the fundamental torsional oscillations, we\nconstrain the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy, $L$, for\nreasonable values of the star's mass $M$ and radius $R$. Meanwhile, we find\nthat the 1st overtone of torsional oscillations obtained for given $M$ and $R$\ncan be expressed well as a function of a new parameter $\\varsigma\\equiv (K_0^4\nL^5)^{1/9}$, where $K_0$ is the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter.\nAssuming that the lowest of the QPO frequencies above 500 Hz observed in SGR\n1806-20 comes from the 1st overtone, we can constrain the value of $\\varsigma$.\nThen, for each neutron star model, such a value of $L$ as can be obtained from\nthe observed low frequency QPOs translates to the optimal value of $K_0$ via\nthe above constraint on $\\varsigma$. Finally, its consistency with allowed\nvalues of $K_0$ from empirical giant monopole resonances leads to neutron star\nmodels with relatively low mass and large radius, which are qualitatively\nsimilar to the prediction in earlier investigations.

Overall the X-ray spectrum of\nMCG-03-58-007 is highly absorbed by a neutral column density of NH~10^23 cm^-2,\nin agreement with the optical classification as a type 2 AGN. In addition, this\nobservation unveiled the presence of two deep absorption troughs at E = 7.4 +-\n0.1 keV and E = 8.5 +- 0.2 keV. If associated with blue-shifted FeXXVI, these\nfeatures can be explained with the presence of two highly ionised (log \\xi/(erg\ncm/s)~ 5.5) and high column density (NH~5-8 x 10^23cm^-2) outflowing absorbers\nwith v_out1~ -0.1c and v_out2~ -0.2c.

We\nare able to constrain the eccentricities of 51 systems with a single transiting\nplanet, which supplement our previous measurements of 66 planets in\nmulti-planet systems. Through a Bayesian hierarchical analysis, we find\nevidence that systems with only one detected transiting planet have a different\neccentricity distribution than systems with multiple detected transiting\nplanets. The eccentricity distribution of the single-transiting systems is well\ndescribed by the positive half of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a\ndispersion $\\sigma_e = 0.32 \\pm 0.06$, while the multiple-transit systems are\nconsistent with $\\sigma_e = 0.083^{+0.015}_{-0.020}$.

Recent advances in computational\nfashion include the development of domain-specific numerical representations.\nOur model Studio2Shop builds on top of such representations and uses a deep\nconvolutional network trained to match a query image to the numerical feature\nvectors of all the articles annotated in this image. Top-$k$ retrieval\nevaluation on test query images shows that the correct items are most often\nfound within a range that is sufficiently small for building realistic visual\nsearch engines for the studio-to-shop setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 09:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

However, it\nhas many limitations in practical applicability: the path explosion problem\nencumbers scalability, the need for language-specific implementation, the\ninability to handle complex dependencies, and the limited expressiveness of\ntheories supported by underlying satisfiability checkers. Often, relationships\nbetween variables of interest are not expressible directly as purely symbolic\nconstraints. To this end, we present a new approach -- neuro-symbolic execution\n-- which learns an approximation of the relationship as a neural net. It\nfeatures a constraint solver that can solve mixed constraints, involving both\nsymbolic expressions and neural network representation. To do so, we envision\nsuch constraint solving as procedure combining SMT solving and gradient-based\noptimization. We demonstrate the utility of neuro-symbolic execution in\nconstructing exploits for buffer overflows. We report success on 13/14 programs\nwhich have difficult constraints, known to require specialized extensions to\nsymbolic execution.

With high-resolution\nspectrographs, we can not only detect the sodium feature in the atmosphere of\nexoplanets, but also characterize it by studying its line profile. After\nfinding a clearly w-shaped sodium line profile in the transmission spectrum of\nHD189733b, we investigated possible sources of contamination given by the star\nand tried to correct for these spurious deformations. By analyzing the single\ntransmission spectra of HD189733b in the wavelength space, we show that the\nmain sodium signal that causes the absorption in the transmission spectrum is\ncentered on the stellar rest frame. We concentrate on two main stellar effects\nthat contaminate the transmission spectrum: center-to-limb variations and\nstellar rotation. We show the effects on the line profile: while we correct for\nthe CLV using simulated theoretical stellar spectra, we provide a new method,\nbased directly on observational data, to correct for the RM contribution to the\nline profile of the retrieved transmission spectrum. We apply the corrections\nto the spectra of HD189733b. Our analysis shows line profiles of the Na D lines\nin the transmission spectrum that are narrower than reported previously.

Interestingly, our results are in contrast to the situation\nin the exact counting context. We show that the problem of approximately\ncounting retractions is separated both from the problem of approximately\ncounting homomorphisms and from the problem of approximately counting list\nhomomorphisms --- whereas for exact counting all three of these problems are\ninterreducible. We also show that the number of retractions is at least as hard\nto approximate as both the number of surjective homomorphisms and the number of\ncompactions. In contrast, exactly counting compactions is the hardest of all of\nthese exact counting problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 10:47:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 17:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 12:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

Based on quantitative chemical bonding analysis we unravel that\nMg3Sb2 exhibits a nearly isotropic three-dimensional (3D) bonding network with\nthe interlayer and intralayer bonds being surprisingly similar, and these\nunique chemical bonding features are the origin of the nearly isotropic\nstructural and thermal properties.

More precisely, we express some of such values in\nterms of certain resolutions of $f$. The expression is given it terms of the\nexceptional divisor strata of arbitrary codimension, generalizing the classical\nA'Campo formula that consumes only codimension 1 strata and produces only\nmonodromy eigenvalues at the origin. For this purpose, we introduce tropical\ncharacteristic classes of germs of analytic sets, and use this calculus to\ndetect some of the nearby monodromy eigenvalues, which we call tropical.\n  The study is motivated by the monodromy conjectures by Igusa, Denef and\nLoeser: every pole of an appropriate local zeta function of $f$ induces a\nnearby monodromy eigenvalue. We propose a presumably stronger version of this\nconjecture: all poles of the local zeta function induce tropical nearby\nmonodromy eigenvalues.\n  In particular, if the singularity is non-degenerate with respect to its\nNewton polyhedron $N$, then the tropical monodromy eigenvalues can be expressed\nin terms of fiber polytopes of certain faces of $N$, so our conjecture (unlike\nthe original ones) becomes a purely combinatorial statement about a polyhedron.\nThis statement is confirmed for the topological zeta function in dimension up\nto 4 in a joint work with A.

However, the use of a PC surrogate introduces the modeling error,\nthat may severely distort the estimate of the posterior distribution. This\nerror can be corrected by increasing the order of the PC expansion, but the\ncost for building the surrogate may increase dramatically. In this work, we\nseek to address this challenge by proposing an adaptive procedure to construct\na multi-fidelity PC surrogate. This new strategy combines (a large number of)\nlow-fidelity surrogate model evaluations and (a small number of) high-fidelity\nmodel evaluations, yielding an adaptive multi-fidelity approach. Here the\nlow-fidelity surrogate is chosen as the prior-based PC surrogate, while the\nhigh-fidelity model refers to the true forward model. The key idea is to\nconstruct and refine the multi-fidelity approach over a sequence of samples\nadaptively determined form data, so that the approximation can eventually\nconcentrate to the posterior distribution. We illustrate the performance of the\nproposed strategy through two nonlinear inverse problems. It is shown that the\nproposed adaptive multi-fidelity approach can improve significantly the\naccuracy, yet without a dramatic increase in the computational complexity. The\nnumerical results also indicate that our new algorithm can enhance the\nefficiency by several orders of magnitude compared to a standard MCMC approach\nusing only the true forward model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 12:13:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 00:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

This scintillator consists of microscopic grains of inorganic\ncrystals suspended in an organic scintillating carrier medium. Due to multiple\nscattering off the crystals, this scintillator appears opaque over longer\ndistances and is intended for use in specialized detectors. Thanks to the\ncrystal phase it can natively incorporate a large variety of elements in large\nquantities, so that a sufficiently large detector can reach elemental loadings\non the ton- or multiton scale. At the same time, this composition can produce\nvery high light outputs and provides additional particle identification\ncapabilities.

The dust extinction curve is measured along the GRB afterglow line of\nsight and the analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the host\ngalaxy gives access to the global dust attenuation of the stellar light. We\nselected a sample of 30 GRBs for which the extinction curve along the GRB\nafterglow line-of-sight (l.o.s) is measured in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)\nup to optical and we analysed the properties of the extinction curve as a\nfunction of the host galaxy properties. From these 30 GRBs, we selected seven\nGRBHs with a good rest-frame UV to near infra-red spectral coverage for the\nhost. The attenuation curve was derived by fitting the SEDs of the GRBH sample\nwith the CIGALE SED fitting code. Different star formation histories were\nstudied to recover the star formation rates (SFR) derived using H$_{\\alpha}$\nluminosities. The most extinguished GRBs are preferentially found in the more\nmassive hosts and the UV bump is preferentially found in the most extinguished\nGRB l.o.s. Five out of seven hosts are best fitted with a recent burst of star\nformation, leading to lower stellar mass estimates than previously found. The\naverage attenuation in the host galaxies is about 70% of the amount of\nextinction along the GRB l.o.s. We find a great variety in the derived\nattenuation curves of GRBHs, the UV slope can be similar, flatter or even\nsteeper than the extinction curve slope. We find that the flatter (steeper)\nattenuation curves are found in galaxies with the highest (lowest) SFR and\nstellar masses. The comparison of our results with radiative transfer\nsimulations leads to a uniform distribution of dust and stars in a very clumpy\nISM for half the GRBHs and various dust-stars geometries for the second half of\nthe sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 12:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Finally, we discuss how mid-infrared single photons can be detected.\nUsing our numerical results, we identify materials and pump lasers for\nup-conversion detection in conventional wavelength bands. Our study provides a\ncomplete recipe for mid-IR single-photon generation and detection, opening up\nquantum enhancements for mid-IR applications such as bio-medical imaging,\ncommunication, and remote sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 13:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

This is particularly true in urban environments, where mass data\ncapture is particularly valuable, but the objects captured are more varied,\ndenser, and complex. To understand the structure and content of the\nenvironment, we must process the unstructured data to a structured form. BigSUR\nis an urban reconstruction algorithm which fuses GIS data, photogrammetric\nmeshes, and street level photography, to create clean representative,\nsemantically labelled, geometry. However, we have identified three problems\nwith the system i) the street level photography is often difficult to acquire;\nii) novel fa\\c{c}ade styles often frustrate the detection of windows and doors;\niii) the computational requirements of the system are large, processing a large\ncity block can take up to 15 hours. In this paper we describe the process of\nsimplifying and validating the BigSUR semantic reconstruction system. In\nparticular, the requirement for street level images is removed, and greedy\npost-process profile assignment is introduced to accelerate the system. We\naccomplish this by modifying the binary integer programming (BIP) optimization,\nand re-evaluating the effects of various parameters. The new variant of the\nsystem is evaluated over a variety of urban areas. We objectively measure mean\nsquared error (MSE) terms over the unstructured geometry, showing that BigSUR\nis able to accurately recover omissions from the input meshes. Further, we\nevaluate the ability of the system to label the walls and roofs of input\nmeshes, concluding that our new BigSUR variant achieves highly accurate\nsemantic labelling with shorter computational time and less input data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 14:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

We argue that it should\nalso simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1)\nthis would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the\nmini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and\n3) in optimal settings, SGAN would be equivalent to integral probability metric\n(IPM) GANs.\n  We show that this property can be induced by using a relativistic\ndiscriminator which estimate the probability that the given real data is more\nrealistic than a randomly sampled fake data. We also present a variant in which\nthe discriminator estimate the probability that the given real data is more\nrealistic than fake data, on average. We generalize both approaches to\nnon-standard GAN loss functions and we refer to them respectively as\nRelativistic GANs (RGANs) and Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs).

Scheduling algorithms\nbased on the TIN optimality condition have recently been proposed, e.g., for\napplication to device-to-device communications. TIN, however, has never been\napplied to cellular networks. In this work, we propose a scheduling algorithm\nfor application to cellular networks that is based on the TIN optimality\ncondition. In the proposed scheduling algorithm, each base station (BS) first\nrandomly selects a user equipment (UE) in its coverage region, and then checks\nthe TIN optimality conditions. If the latter conditions are not fulfilled, the\nBS is turned off. In order to assess the performance of TIN applied to cellular\nnetworks, we introduce an analytical framework with the aid of stochastic\ngeometry theory. We develop, in particular, tractable expressions of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability and average\nrate of cellular networks. In addition, we carry out asymptotic analysis to\nfind the optimal system parameters that maximize the SINR coverage probability.\nBy using the optimized system parameters, it is shown that TIN applied to\ncellular networks yields significant gains in terms of SINR coverage\nprobability and average rate. Specifically, the numerical results show that\naverage rate gains of the order of $21\\%$ over conventional scheduling\nalgorithms are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 15:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

HyperLTL extends linear-time\ntemporal logic (LTL) with explicit quantification over traces in order to\nexpress Hyperproperties. We investigate the runtime verification problem of\nHyperLTL formulas for three different input models: (1) The parallel model,\nwhere a fixed number of system executions is processed in parallel. (2) The\nunbounded sequential model, where system executions are processed sequentially,\none execution at a time. In this model, the number of incoming executions may\ngrow forever. (3) The bounded sequential model where the traces are processed\nsequentially and the number of incoming executions is bounded. We show that\ndeciding monitorability of HyperLTL formulas is PSPACE-complete for input\nmodels (1) and (3).

In\naddition, we use a tree-based approach that visualizes events and actions to\naid analysts in their understanding of large amounts of unstructured data.\nUsing existing data, we have discovered that our approach has a good success\nrate in detecting illegal insider trading patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 04:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 16:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 20:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

The fields' coincidence is provable at small Mach numbers,\nhowever at finite Mach numbers the assumption of mixing is needed, not evident\ndue to the possibility of self-organization. Irrespective of whether the fields\ncoincide we obtain a number of rigorous conclusions on both fields. As Ma\nincreases the fields in the inertial range go through a phase transition from a\nfinite continuous smooth to a singular multifractal distribution. We propose a\nway to calculate fractal dimensions from numerical or experimental data. We\nderive a simple expression for the spectrum of fractal dimensions of isothermal\nturbulence and describe limitations of lognormality. The expression depends on\na single parameter: the scaling exponent of the density spectrum. We propose a\nmechanism for the phase transition of concentration to multifractality.

Our\napproach is based on a deconvolutional network trained on a set of 120 patients\nwho underwent both CT acquisitions in the same contrastographic arterial phase\nand the same cardiac phase. To ensure a reliable predicted CECT image, in terms\nof values and morphology, a custom loss function is defined by combining an\nerror function to find a pixel-wise correspondence, which takes into account\nthe similarity in term of Hounsfield units between the input and output images\nand by a cross-entropy computed on the binarized versions of the synthesized\nand of the real CECT image. The proposed method is finally tested on 20\nsubjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 15:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-06"}

One\nof the most common falls, the forward fall, frequently occurs among adults and\nthe elderly. In this study, we propose using a human body model, developed\nusing the MAthematical DYnamic MOdel (MADYMO) software, in place of human\nsubjects, to investigate forward fall-related injuries. The MADYMO human body\nmodel is capable of simulating items that cannot be assessed on human subjects,\nsuch as human kinematics, human dynamics, and the possibility of injuries. In\norder to achieve our goal, a set of experiments was conducted to measure the\nimpact force during a worst-case forward fall scenario (the outstretched hand\nposition) for two short fall heights. Similar to the experimental design used\non the human subjects, we generated a MADYMO human model. After performing the\nsimulations, the results of the experiment on the human subjects and the MADYMO\nsimulation model were compared. We demonstrated a significant correlation\nbetween the MADYMO simulation and the human subject experiments with respect to\nthe magnitude and timing of the impact forces. Consequently, we validated the\nMADYMO human body model as a means to accurately assess forward fall-related\ninjuries. Additionally, we compared the predicted results of a mathematical\nmodel with the MADYMO human body model. The MADYMO model is reliable and can\ndemonstrate an accurate impact time. Therefore, we conclude that the MADYMO\nhuman model can be utilized as a reliable model to investigate forward\nfall-related injuries from a typical standing position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 09:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

The kinematic features of the two MCs at\n~73--84 km/s, as well as those of the corresponding atomic-gas counterparts,\nare consistent with the kinematic characteristics of SS 433. That is, the\nreceding gas from SS 433 jet is probably responsible for the redshifted feature\nof G39.315-1.155 near the Galactic plane and the approaching one may power the\nblueshifted gas of G40.331-4.302 toward the observer.

At an elementary level I propose a new angular momentum\nseparation for the massless Dirac field in a free theory which mimics the usual\nfree photon angular momentum separation pattern in Coulomb gauge. In connection\nwith this construction I introduce a somewhat idiosyncratic formalism in a free\nmassless Dirac theory which I call \"dressed axial $U(1)_A$ symmetry\". I show\nthat this new \"fermion spin operator\", which is more correctly called \"helicity\nvector operator\", can be incorporated into this new symmetry pattern in a\nnatural way. This set of \"dressed axial vector current\" and its corresponding\ncharges show an interesting internal structure and may be useful in a broader\nphysical context. I then discuss the case of the QED model with a massless\nDirac fermion. In the case of covariant quantization, I give a new and correct\nproof that the additional term in the total angular momentum operator stemming\nfrom the gauge-fixing term does not contribute at the level of physical matrix\nelements, which is discussed in the relevant literature. At the level of\nasymptotic fields I construct the helicity vector operator of the QED theory\nwhich actually coincides with the usual projection of the total angular\nmomentum operator when acting on a beam of collinearly moving free particles. I\nthen consider the QCD model with only two massless light quarks. In this\ncontext I discuss the approximate concept of \"asymptotic quark and gluon\nfields\" which is relevant to the usual parton model picture and propose to use\nthe asymptotic \"quark helicity vector\" operator to describe the quark helicity\ncontribution to an IMF proton. Finally, I give some remarks on the concept of\nIMF itself, which show that this very concept should be understood with some\nreservation from a rigorous mathematical consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 09:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

This leads researchers to\nconsider that the evolution of security prices is basically random, and, thus,\ninherently not predictable. We show that the evolution of security prices is\nnot a stochastic process but largely deterministic and governed by a physical\nlaw. The law takes the form of a physicomathematical theory centered around a\npurely mathematical function, unrelated to models and statistical methods. It\ncan be described as an \"isodense\" network of moving regression curves of an\norder greater than or equal to 1. The salient aspect of the function is that,\nwhen inputting a time series of any security into the function, new\nmathematical objects emerge spontaneously, and these objects exhibit the unique\nproperty of attracting and repelling the quantity. The graphical representation\nof the function is called a \"topological network\" due to the preeminence of\nshapes over metrics, and the emergent objects are called \"characteristic\nfigures\" (mainly \"cords\"). The attraction and repulsion of the price by the\ncords results in the price bouncing from cord to cord. Thus, the price has to\nbe considered as driven by the cords in a semi-deterministic manner (leaning\ntowards deterministic). With a function that describes the evolution of the\nprice, we now understand the reason behind each price movement and can also\npredict prices both qualitatively and quantitatively. The function is\nuniversal, does not rely on any fitting, and, due to its extreme sensitivity,\nreveals the hidden order in financial time series data that existing research\nnever uncovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2018 20:22:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 16:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 02:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}
