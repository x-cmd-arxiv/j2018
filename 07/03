Earlier\nmethods are typically designed to tackle only between-group unfairness, which\nmay be justified for legal or other reasons. However, we demonstrate that\nminimizing exclusively the between-group component may, in fact, increase the\nwithin-group, and hence the overall unfairness.

If so this\nobservation places constraints on the origin and possible source distribution\nof these electrons in the galaxy. The intensities of these electrons as well as\nMeV protons and other higher energy electrons and nuclei have been followed\noutward from the Earth to beyond the heliopause during the 40 years of the\nVoyager mission. Among the other new features found in this study of the radial\ndependence of the electron intensity in the heliosphere are: 1. The heliosheath\nis a source of sub-MeV electrons as well as the already known anomalous cosmic\nrays of MeV and above, none of which appear to escape from the heliosphere\nbecause of an almost impenetrable heliopause at these lower energies; 2. Solar\nmodulation effects are observed for these MeV electrons throughout the\nheliosphere. These modulation effects are particularly strong for electrons in\nthe heliosheath and comprise over 90 percent of the observed intensity change\nof these electrons of 10-60 MeV between the Earth and the heliopause. Even for\nnuclei of 1 GV in rigidity, over 30 percent of the total intensity difference\nbetween the Earth and the LIM occurs in the heliosheath; 3. The 2 MeV protons\nstudied here for the first time beyond the heliopause are also part of the low\nenergy tail of the spectrum of galactic cosmic ray protons, similar to the tail\nnoted above for sub MeV galactic cosmic ray electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 17:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}

Avoiding the exponential\noverhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of\nlarger algorithms, and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm's cost\non a quantum computer. To this end, we propose a variational hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithm called quantum-assisted quantum compiling (QAQC).\nIn QAQC, we use the overlap between a target unitary $U$ and a trainable\nunitary $V$ as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer. More\nprecisely, to ensure that QAQC scales well with problem size, our cost involves\nnot only the global overlap ${\\rm Tr} (V^\\dagger U)$ but also the local\noverlaps with respect to individual qubits. We introduce novel short-depth\nquantum circuits to quantify the terms in our cost function, and we prove that\nour cost cannot be efficiently approximated with a classical algorithm under\nreasonable complexity assumptions. We present both gradient-free and\ngradient-based approaches to minimizing this cost. As a demonstration of QAQC,\nwe compile various one-qubit gates on IBM's and Rigetti's quantum computers\ninto their respective native gate alphabets. Furthermore, we successfully\nsimulate QAQC up to a problem size of 9 qubits, and these simulations highlight\nboth the scalability of our cost function as well as the noise resilience of\nQAQC. Future applications of QAQC include algorithm depth compression,\nblack-box compiling, noise mitigation, and benchmarking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 17:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 17:43:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 17:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 16:05:24 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 16:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

However, these algorithms rely on large training samples of\nlabelled galaxies (typically thousands of them). A key question for using DL\nclassifications in future Big Data surveys is how much of the knowledge\nacquired from an existing survey can be exported to a new dataset, i.e. if the\nfeatures learned by the machines are meaningful for different data. We test the\nperformance of DL models, trained with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, on\nDark Energy survey (DES) using images for a sample of $\\sim$5000 galaxies with\na similar redshift distribution to SDSS. Applying the models directly to DES\ndata provides a reasonable global accuracy ($\\sim$ 90%), but small completeness\nand purity values. A fast domain adaptation step, consisting in a further\ntraining with a small DES sample of galaxies ($\\sim$500-300), is enough for\nobtaining an accuracy > 95% and a significant improvement in the completeness\nand purity values. This demonstrates that, once trained with a particular\ndataset, machines can quickly adapt to new instrument characteristics (e.g.,\nPSF, seeing, depth), reducing by almost one order of magnitude the necessary\ntraining sample for morphological classification.

Our\nmeasurements are based on homogeneous and deep multi-band photometry spanning\nu- to the Ks-band for each cluster and are supported by spectroscopic data from\ndifferent programs.

The f_EQ shows no stellar-mass dependence\nin any environment, but it increases from 40% in the cluster outskirts to ~90%\nin the cluster centres. The radial signature of f_EQ provides constraints on\nwhere the dominant quenching mechanism operates in these clusters and on what\ntimescale.

In this work, we highlight a more severe, previously\nunrecognized shortcoming of ES models: the large-scale 21 cm power spectrum\n(equivalently, HI bias b_HI) is a relatively strong function of the spatial\nresolution used to generate ES ionization maps. We trace this problem to the\nfact that photon non-conservation in these models arises from a\nresolution-dependent mixture of spatially resolved, photon non-conserving\nbubbles, and partially ionized grid cells which are perfectly photon-conserving\nby construction. We argue that this inevitably leads to a resolution-dependence\nof b_HI, with the correct, converged value only emerging at very coarse\nresolution. Quantitatively, we find that b_HI can be non-converged by as much\nas ~20-25% in conservative ES implementations with grid sizes Delta x=5-10\ncMpc/h, even when photon non-conservation is as small as ~3-4%.

We analyze these instabilities in both a linear perturbation\nanalysis and a three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation. An unstable normal\nmode of a differentially rotating star is detected by solving an eigenvalue\nproblem along the equatorial plane of the star. The physical mechanism of low\nT/W dynamical instabilities is also qualitatively confirmed by a scattering of\nsound waves between corotation and the surface caused by the corotation\nbarrier. Therefore, we can draw a picture of existing pulsation modes\nunstabilized due to an amplified reflection of sound waves from the corotation\nbarrier. The feature in the eigenfrequency and eigenfunction of the unstable\nmode in the linear analysis roughly agrees with that in the three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulation in Newtonian gravity. Moreover, the nature of the\neigenfunction that oscillates between corotation and the surface for an\nunstable star requires reinterpretation of pulsation modes in differentially\nrotating stars. Finally, we propose a manner by which to constrain the\nstiffness of the equation of state by the direct detection of mode decomposed\ngravitational waveforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 18:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

To avoid costly\npreemptions, we consider non-preemptive scheduling: Each VM has to be assigned\nto a server which has enough residual capacity to accommodate it, and once a VM\nis assigned to a server, its service \\textit{cannot} be disrupted (preempted).\nPrior approaches to this problem either have high complexity, require\nsynchronization among the servers, or yield queue sizes/delays which are\nexcessively large.

In this work we focus on the\nchemical composition of stars belonging to the extreme He-rich population\npopulated by stars with the most extreme abundance of Mg, Al, Na, O and Si. We\nchecked whether the most recent measures are consistent with the AGB yields of\nstars of $6.5-8~M_{\\odot}$. These stars evolve on time scales of the order of\n40-60 Myr and eject matter strongly enriched in helium, owing to a deep\npenetration of the surface convective zone down to regions touched by CNO\nnucleosynthesis occurring after the core He-burning phase. Since the big\nunknown of the AGB phase of massive stars is the mass loss, we propose a new\napproch that takes into account the effects of the radiation pressure on dust\nparticles.

The remote observations of solar flare ion acceleration are rather\nlimited. There are theoretical predictions for signatures of ion acceleration\nin EUV line profiles. Previous tests involve observations of flares with no\nevidence for energetic ions. Aims. We aim to examine a source flare of\nimpulsive (or 3He-rich) solar energetic particle events with EUV line\nspectroscopy. Methods. We inspect all (90+) reported 3He-rich flares of\nprevious solar cycle 23 and find only four (recurrent) jets in the field of\nview of SOHO CDS. The jet with the most suitable spatial and temporal coverage\nis analyzed in detail. Results. Two enhanced (non-thermal) line broadenings are\nobserved in the cooler chromospheric / transition-region lines and they are\nlocalized near the site where the closed magnetic loops reconnect with the open\nmagnetic field lines. Both enhanced broadenings are found in the sites with\nredshifts in the lines, surrounded by the region with blueshifts. One enhanced\nline broadening is associated with a small flare without energetic particle\nsignatures while another occurs just after the particle acceleration signatures\nof the main flare terminated. Conclusions. The observed excess broadening\nappears to be not directly related to the energetic ion production and motions.\nFurther investigations where the critical impulsive phase of the flare is\ncovered are required, ideally with high-resolution spectrometers intentionally\npointed to the 3He-rich solar energetic particle source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 19:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

The proposed algorithm consists\nof an estimation phase and an allocation phase. It is shown that if every user\nadopts the algorithm, the system wide regret is constant with time with high\nprobability. The regret guarantees hold for any number of users and channels,\nin particular, even when the number of users is less than the number of\nchannels. Next, an adversarial multi-user MAB framework is considered, where\nthe rewards on the channels are user-dependent.

The basic theoretical model of the galactic disk used\ninvolves gravitationally-coupled two-component system (stars and gas) embedded\nin a rigid and non-responsive dark matter halo. The first part of the thesis\ninvolves searching for the dynamical effect of dark matter halo on small-scale\nspiral structure in dwarf low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies and also some\ndwarf irregular galaxies which host an extended HI disk. In both cases, the\nrotation curves are found to be dominated by the contribution of the dark\nmatter halo over a large radial distance, starting from the inner regions of\nthe galaxies. The next part of the thesis deals with the investigation of the\npossible effect of the interstellar gas on the persistence issue and the\npattern speeds of the spiral structure in the disk galaxies.

However, their\napplication to dynamic multiphase flow problems is hindered by the curse of\ndimensionality, the saturation discontinuity due to capillarity effects, and\nthe time-dependence of the multi-output responses. In this paper, we propose a\ndeep convolutional encoder-decoder neural network methodology to tackle these\nissues. The surrogate modeling task is transformed to an image-to-image\nregression strategy. This approach extracts high-level coarse features from the\nhigh-dimensional input permeability images using an encoder, and then refines\nthe coarse features to provide the output pressure/saturation images through a\ndecoder. A training strategy combining a regression loss and a segmentation\nloss is proposed in order to better approximate the discontinuous saturation\nfield. To characterize the high-dimensional time-dependent outputs of the\ndynamic system, time is treated as an additional input to the network that is\ntrained using pairs of input realizations and of the corresponding system\noutputs at a limited number of time instances. The proposed method is evaluated\nusing a geological carbon storage process-based multiphase flow model with a\n2500-dimensional stochastic permeability field. With a relatively small number\nof training data, the surrogate model is capable of accurately characterizing\nthe spatio-temporal evolution of the pressure and discontinuous CO2 saturation\nfields and can be used efficiently to compute the statistics of the system\nresponses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 20:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-02"}

In\naddition to edge conduction, these systems have been shown to host higher-order\ntopological modes.

The edge states have spin polarization that\nreverses for opposite propagation direction, thus supporting directional\nexcitation. Corner states are pinned to the meta-structure corners, and rapidly\ndecay both along the edges and into the bulk. Interestingly, these 0D states\ncan spectrally overlap with the continuum of bulk states, but are not\ncompatible with radiation, thus enabling embedded topological eigenstates\nwithin the continuum of bulk modes.

Two of such examples are graphene, which enables\nstrong modulation of its conductivity due to saturable absorption, and quantum\nwells where population inversion can be achieved in an ultrafast manner. On the\nother hand, non-Hermitian Floquet potentials have not been shown to yield novel\ntopological phases to date. It is therefore of great interest to explore\ntime-modulated non-Hermitian potentials in periodic lattices, and the emergence\nof topological phases associated with them.

We expect that several new applications in\napproximation algorithms will be derived from this connection in future.\nFormally, we prove that the multivariate generating polynomial of the bases of\nany matroid is log-concave as a function over the positive orthant. For the\nsecond ingredient, we develop a general framework for approximate counting in\ndiscrete problems, based on convex optimization. The connection goes through\nsubadditivity of the entropy. For matroids, we prove that an approximate\nsuperadditivity of the entropy holds by relying on the log-concavity of the\ncorresponding polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 23:50:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 02:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

To enhance\ninterpretability of a model, identifying potentially relevant features is often\na step before fitting all the features into a regression model. A good variable\nselection method should effectively control the fraction of false discoveries\nand ensure large enough power of its selection set. In a lot of contemporary\ndata applications, a great portion of features are coded as binary variables.\nBinary features are widespread in many fields, from online controlled\nexperiments to genome science to physical statistics. Although there has\nrecently been a handful of literature for provable false discovery rate (FDR)\ncontrol in variable selection, most of the theoretical analyses were based on\nsome strong dependency assumption or Gaussian assumption among features. In\nthis paper we propose a variable selection method in regression framework for\nselecting binary features. Under mild conditions, we show that FDR is\ncontrolled exactly under a target level in a finite sample if the underlying\ndistribution of the binary features is known. We show in simulations that FDR\ncontrol is still attained when feature distribution is estimated from data.

In order to\napply these approaches to massive text corpora, the vocabulary needs to be\nreduced considerably and large computer clusters and/or GPUs are typically\nrequired. Moreover, the number of topics must be provided beforehand but this\ndepends on the corpus characteristics and it is often difficult to estimate,\nespecially for massive text corpora. Unfortunately, both topic quality and time\ncomplexity are sensitive to this choice. This paper describes an alternative\napproach to discover topics based on Min-Hashing, which can handle massive text\ncorpora and large vocabularies using modest computer hardware and does not\nrequire to fix the number of topics in advance. The basic idea is to generate\nmultiple random partitions of the corpus vocabulary to find sets of highly\nco-occurring words, which are then clustered to produce the final topics. In\ncontrast to probabilistic topic models where topics are distributions over the\ncomplete vocabulary, the topics discovered by the proposed approach are sets of\nhighly co-occurring words. Interestingly, these topics underlie various\nthematics with different levels of granularity. An extensive qualitative and\nquantitative evaluation using the 20 Newsgroups (18K), Reuters (800K), Spanish\nWikipedia (1M), and English Wikipedia (5M) corpora shows that the proposed\napproach is able to consistently discover meaningful and coherent topics.\nRemarkably, the time complexity of the proposed approach is linear with respect\nto corpus and vocabulary size; a non-parallel implementation was able to\ndiscover topics from the entire English edition of Wikipedia with over 5\nmillion documents and 1 million words in less than 7 hours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 00:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 06:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

Basin effects can significantly affect the amplitude, frequency and\nduration of strong ground motion, while the cone-like geometry of the basin\nedges gives rise to large amplitude surface waves through seismic wave\ndiffraction and energy focusing, a well-known characteristic of basin effects.\nIn this research, we study the role of basin effects in the mainshock ground\nmotion data recorded at the Kathmandu basin, Nepal during the 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha\nearthquake sequence. We specifically try to understand the source of the\nunusual low frequency reverberating pulse that appeared systematically across\nthe basin, and the unexpected depletion of the ground surface motions from high\nfrequency components, especially away from the basin edges. In order to do that\nwe study the response of a 2D cross section of Kathmandu basin subjected to\nvertically propagating plane SV waves. Despite the scarcity of geotechnical\ninformation and of strong ground motion recordings, we show that an idealized\nplane-strain elastic model with a simplified layered velocity structure can\ncapture surprisingly well the low frequency components of the basin ground\nresponse. We finally couple the 2D elastic simulation with a 1D nonlinear\nanalysis of the shallow basin sediments. The 1D nonlinear approximation shows\nimproved performance over a larger frequency range relative to the first order\napproximation of a 2D elastic layered basin response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 01:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

However, this approach has many\nlimitations due to the nonlinear and nonstationary behavior of the BCG signal.\nThis is because the BCG signal does not display consistent J-peaks, which can\nusually be the case for overnight, in-home monitoring, particularly with frail\nelderly. Additionally, its accuracy will be undoubtedly affected by motion\nartifacts. Second, frequency-domain algorithms do not provide information about\ninterbeat intervals. Nevertheless, they can provide information about heart\nrate variability. This is usually done by taking the fast Fourier transform or\nthe inverse Fourier transform of the logarithm of the estimated spectrum, i.e.,\ncepstrum of the signal using a sliding window. Thereafter, the dominant\nfrequency is obtained in a particular frequency range. The limit of these\nalgorithms is that the peak in the spectrum may get wider and multiple peaks\nmay appear, which might cause a problem in measuring the vital signs. At last,\nthe objective of wavelet-domain algorithms is to decompose the signal into\ndifferent components, hence the component which shows an agreement with the\nvital signs can be selected i.e., the selected component contains only\ninformation about the heart cycles or respiratory cycles, respectively. An\nempirical mode decomposition is an alternative approach to wavelet\ndecomposition, and it is also a very suitable approach to cope with nonlinear\nand nonstationary signals such as cardiorespiratory signals. Apart from the\nabove-mentioned algorithms, machine learning approaches have been implemented\nfor measuring heartbeats.

Significant inroads have\nbeen made into understanding this fact in terms of rapid ion migration, now a\nwell-established property of the prototype photovoltaic perovskite MAPbI$_3$\nand strongly implicated in the newer mixed compositions. Here we study the\nmanifestations of ion migration in frequency-domain small-signal measurements,\nfocusing on the popular technique of Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).\nWe provide new interpretations for a variety of previously puzzling features,\nincluding giant photo-induced low-frequency capacitance and negative\ncapacitance in a variety of forms.

The latter\ncontribution to the capacitance can take either a positive or a negative sign,\nand is potentially very large when slow, voltage-sensitive processes such as\nion migration are at play. Using numerical drift-diffusion semiconductor\nmodels, we show that giant photo-induced capacitance, inductive loop features,\nand low-frequency negative capacitance all emerge naturally as consequences of\nion migration via its coupling to quasi-steady-state electron and hole\ncurrents. In doing so, we unify the understanding of EIS measurements with the\ncomparably well-developed theory of rate dependent current-voltage (I-V)\nmeasurements in perovskite cells. Comparing the two techniques, we argue that\nEIS is more suitable for quantifying I-V hysteresis than conventional methods\nbased on I-V sweeps, and demonstrate this application on a variety of cell\ntypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 02:30:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 00:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 05:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

For example, we can enforce in the training loss function that a\ndetected landmark at frame$_{t-1}$ followed by optical flow tracking from\nframe$_{t-1}$ to frame$_t$ should coincide with the location of the detection\nat frame$_t$.

To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we propose a\nfast Deep learning based approach for CS-MUD in massive MTC systems. In\nparticular, a novel block restrictive activation nonlinear unit, is proposed to\ncapture the block sparse structure in wide-band wireless communication systems\n(or multi-antenna systems). Our simulation results show that the proposed\napproach outperforms various existing algorithms for CS-MUD and allows for\nten-fold decrease of the computing time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 03:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

This unusual cell response\noccurs if a first pulse is followed by a second pulse with opposite polarity.\nPossibly universal, BPC presently lacks a mechanistic explanation. Multiple\nversions of the \"standard model\" of cell electroporation (EP) fail to account\nfor BPC. Here we show, for the first time, how an extension of the standard\nmodel can account for a key experimental observation that essentially defines\nBPC: the amount of a tracer that enters a cell, and how tracer influx can be\ndecreased by the second part of a bipolar pulse. The extended model can also\naccount for the recovery of BPC wherein the extent of BPC is diminished if the\nspacing between the first and second pulses is increased. Our approach is\nreverse engineering, meaning that we identify and introduce an additional\nbiophysical mechanism that allows pore transport to change. We hypothesize that\noccluding molecules from outside the membrane enter or relocate within a pore.\nSignificantly, the additional mechanism is fundamental and general, involving a\ncombination of partitioning and hindrance. Molecules near the membrane can\nenter pores to block transport of tracer molecules while still passing small\nions (+/- 1) that govern electrical behavior. Accounting for such behavior\nrequires an extension of the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 05:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

A similar result\nof the method in the multi-frequency case is also presented in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 09:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

Two new results are obtained: we prove that those symmetries appear\nif and only if the Chern-Simons coupling of the $D=11$ theory takes the value\npredicted by supersymmetry, and we obtain a manifestly $E_{7(7)}$-invariant\nformula for the entropy of non-extremal black holes in $D=4$, $N=8$\nsupergravity. The second part is motivated by supergravity gaugings. We examine\nthrough BRST methods the local deformations of non-minimally coupled scalars\nand abelian vector fields in four dimensions. We prove that they are all of the\nusual Yang-Mills type, i.e., correspond to the gauging of some rigid symmetries\nof the undeformed theory. We also show that other Lagragians considered in the\nliterature, containing additional fields, do not allow for gaugings that cannot\nbe reached starting from the usual Lagrangian. In the third part, we construct\nself-contained action principles for several self-dual free fields in six\ndimensions. These fields are motivated by two considerations: they allow for a\ngeometric interpretation of the electric-magnetic duality symmetries of\nlinearized gravity in four dimensions, and they also appear in the spectrum of\nthe chiral $N=(4,0)$ and $N=(3,1)$ \"exotic supergravities\" in place of a\nmetric.

While the co-temporal UV observations at 1.5'' spatial\nresolution and 24s cadence from the Solar Dynamics Observatory showed a compact\nbrightening, the SUNRISE observations at diffraction-limited spatial resolution\nof 0.1'' at 7s cadence revealed a dynamic sub-structure of the burst that it is\ncomposed of extended ribbon-like features and a rapidly evolving arcade of thin\n(~0.1'' wide) magnetic loop-like features, similar to post-flare loops. Such a\ndynamic sub-structure reveals the small-scale nature of chromospheric heating\nin these bursts. Furthermore, based on magnetic field extrapolations, this\nheating event is associated with a complex fan-spine magnetic topology. Our\nobservations strongly hint at a unified picture of magnetic heating in the\nsolar atmosphere from some large-scale flares to small-scale bursts, all being\nassociated with such a magnetic topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 10:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) achieve this by attaching weights to\nformulas in first-order logic, and can be seen as templates for constructing\nfeatures for ground Markov networks. Most techniques for learning weights of\nMLNs are domain-size agnostic, i.e., the size of the domain is not explicitly\ntaken into account while learn- ing the parameters of the model. This often\nresults in ex- treme probabilities when testing on domain sizes different from\nthose seen during training. In this paper, we propose Domain Aware Markov logic\nNetworks (DA-MLNs) which present a principled solution to this problem. While\ndefin- ing the ground network distribution, DA-MLNs divide the ground feature\nweight by a scaling factor which is a function of the number of connections the\nground atoms appearing in the feature are involved in. We show that standard\nMLNs fall out as a special case of our formalism when this func- tion evaluates\nto a constant equal to 1.

We predict a strong\nforward/backward asymmetry in the emission of photoelectrons from randomly\noriented samples, which has an opposite sign in the upper and lower\nhemispheres. The predicted PECD effect is phase- and enantiomer-sensitive,\nproviding new insight in this fascinating fundamental phenomenon.

In this setting there\nexist Nash flows over time that can be described by a sequence of static flows\nfeaturing special properties, so-called `thin flows with resetting'.

Recent studies have\ndemonstrated the advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs) for achieving\nremarkable performance in motion and music tasks with little effort for feature\npre-processing. However, applying DNNs for generating dance to a piece of music\nis nevertheless challenging, because of 1) DNNs need to generate large\nsequences while mapping the music input, 2) the DNN needs to constraint the\nmotion beat to the music, and 3) DNNs require a considerable amount of\nhand-crafted data. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep recurrent\nmethod for real-time basic dance generation with audio power spectrum as input.\nThe proposed model employs convolutional layers and a multilayered Long\nShort-Term memory (LSTM) to process the audio input. Then, another deep LSTM\nlayer decodes the target dance sequence. Notably, this end-to-end approach has\n1) an auto-conditioned decode configuration that reduces accumulation of\nfeedback error of large dance sequence, 2) uses a contrastive cost function to\nregulate the mapping between the music and motion beat, and 3) trains with weak\nlabels generated from the motion beat, reducing the amount of hand-crafted\ndata. We evaluate the proposed network based on i) the similarities between\ngenerated and the baseline dancer motion with a cross entropy measure for large\ndance sequences, and ii) accurate timing between the music and motion beat with\nan F-measure. Experimental results revealed that, after training using a small\ndataset, the model generates basic dance steps with low cross entropy and\nmaintains an F-measure score similar to that of a baseline dancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 12:47:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 12:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 00:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

In\nrecent years, due to the difficulty of defining anomalies and the limit of\ncorrecting their labels, research on unsupervised anomaly detection using\ngenerative models has attracted attention. Generally, in those studies, only\nnormal images are used for training to model the distribution of normal images.\nThe model measures the anomalies in the target images by reproducing the most\nsimilar images and scoring image patches indicating their fit to the learned\ndistribution. This approach is based on a strong presumption; the trained model\nshould not be able to generate abnormal images.

These experiments, known as step-stress tests, belong\nto the larger class of accelerated tests used extensively in the reliability\nliterature. The analysis of data from step-stress tests largely relies on the\npopular cumulative exposure model. However, despite its simple form, the\nutility of the model is limited, as it is assumed that the hazard function of\nthe underlying distribution is discontinuous at the points at which the stress\nlevels are changed, which may not be very reasonable. Due to this deficiency,\nKannan et al. \\cite{KKNT:2010} introduced the cumulative risk model, where the\nhazard function is continuous. In this paper we propose a class of parametric\nmodels based on the cumulative risk model assuming the underlying population\ncontains long-term survivors or `cured' fraction. An EM algorithm to compute\nthe maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters is proposed. This\nresearch is motivated by a study on altitude decompression sickness. The\nperformance of different parametric models will be evaluated using data from\nthis study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 13:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The chirp signals\nare quite common in many areas of science and engineering, specially sonar,\nradar, audio signals etc. The observed signals are usually corrupted by noise.\nIn different signal processing applications it is observed that the errors may\nbe heavy tailed. In this paper it is assumed that the additive errors have mean\nzero but may not have finite variance and are independent and identically\ndistributed. We consider the least squares estimators and the approximate least\nsquares estimators which maximize a periodogram like function. It has been\nobserved that both the estimators are strongly consistent. The asymptotic\ndistribution of the least squares estimators is obtained under the assumption\nthat the additive errors are from a symmetric stable distribution. The\napproximate least squares estimators have the same asymptotic distribution as\nthe least squares estimators. We perform some numerical simulations to see how\nthe proposed estimators work.

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel Bayesian approach for quantitative learning for such\nmodels. These models belong to curved exponential families that are difficult\nto handle from a Bayesian perspective. Furthermore, the likelihood cannot be\nanalytically expressed as a function of the marginal log-linear interactions,\nbut only in terms of cell counts or probabilities.\n  Posterior distributions cannot be directly obtained, and MCMC methods are\nneeded. Finally, a well-defined model requires parameter values that lead to\ncompatible marginal probabilities. Hence, any MCMC should account for this\nimportant restriction. We construct a fully automatic and efficient MCMC\nstrategy for quantitative learning for graphical log-linear marginal models\nthat handles these problems. While the prior is expressed in terms of the\nmarginal log-linear interactions, we build an MCMC algorithm that employs a\nproposal on the probability parameter space. The corresponding proposal on the\nmarginal log-linear interactions is obtained via parameter transformation.\n  By this strategy, we achieve to move within the desired target space. At each\nstep, we directly work with well-defined probability distributions.\n  Moreover, we can exploit a conditional conjugate setup to build an efficient\nproposal on probability parameters.

In this paper, we\npropose a method that takes into account the style information to complete a\ngiven set of selected fashion items with a complementary fashion item.\nComplementary items are those items that can be worn along with the selected\nitems according to the style. Addressing this problem facilitates in\nautomatically generating stylish fashion ensembles leading to a richer shopping\nexperience for users.\n  Recently, there has been a surge of online social websites where fashion\nenthusiasts post the outfit of the day and other users can like and comment on\nthem. These posts contain a gold-mine of information about style. In this\npaper, we exploit these posts to train a deep neural network which captures\nstyle in an automated manner. We pose the problem of predicting complementary\nfashion items as a sequence to sequence problem where the input is the selected\nset of fashion items and the output is a complementary fashion item based on\nthe style information learned by the model. We use the encoder decoder\narchitecture to solve this problem of completing the set of fashion items. We\nevaluate the goodness of the proposed model through a variety of experiments.\nWe empirically observe that our proposed model outperforms competitive baseline\nlike apriori algorithm by ~28 in terms of accuracy for top-1 recommendation to\ncomplete the fashion ensemble. We also perform retrieval based experiments to\nunderstand the ability of the model to learn style and rank the complementary\nfashion items and find that using attention in our encoder decoder model helps\nin improving the mean reciprocal rank by ~24. Qualitatively we find the\ncomplementary fashion items generated by our proposed model are richer than the\napriori algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 13:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

But are geometric\ncorrelations alone sufficient to explain the topological relation between the\nlayers of real systems? Here we provide the negative answer to this question.\nWe show that connections in real systems tend to persist from one layer to\nanother irrespectively of their hyperbolic distances. This suggests that in\naddition to purely geometric aspects the explicit link formation process in one\nlayer impacts the topology of other layers. Based on this finding, we present a\nsimple modification to the recently developed Geometric Multiplex Model to\naccount for this effect, and show that the extended model can reproduce the\nbehavior observed in real systems. We also find that link persistence is\nsignificant in all considered multiplexes and can explain their layers' high\nedge overlap, which cannot be explained by coordinate correlations alone.\nFurthermore, by taking both link persistence and hyperbolic distance\ncorrelations into account we can improve trans-layer link prediction. These\nfindings guide the development of multiplex embedding methods, suggesting that\nsuch methods should be accounting for both coordinate correlations and link\npersistence across layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 13:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 12:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

A. Jameson, Phys. Rev.\nAccel.

The beam characteristics during the structure resonance crossing, such\nas the rms emittance growth and the appearance of 2-fold/4-fold structure in\nphase space, are well explained by the mixture characteristic of different\norders of structure resonance. The related `attracting' and `repulsive' effects\nin the structure resonance stop band from below and above crossing are\nconsidered as a natural beam reaction to the coherent structure resonance that\nthe beam spontaneously moves to a structure resonance free region then the\nspace charge takes a weaker importance. In the PIC simulation, it is found that\nthe emittance growth is positively related to the time that the beam spends\ninside the structure resonance stop band. As a potential candidate mechanism,\nthe incoherent particle-core resonance also has been checked. It is found that\nthis incoherent resonance has basic difficulties in explaining the results\nobtained from the self-consistent PIC simulation. The incoherent particle-core\nresonance might lead to phase space distortion, emittance growth, or beam halo\nformation only on a long-time scale. This clarity of the discrepancies between\ncoherent and incoherent resonance mechanisms will lead to a better\nunderstanding of the numerical study and experimental researches obtained\nrecently.

However, it is a priori not evident whether shape and hydrodynamics\nact synergistically or antagonistically to generate motility-induced clustering\n(MIC) and phase separation (MIPS). We employ a model of prolate spheroidal\nmicroswimmers - called squirmers - in quasi-two-dimensional confinement to\naddress this issue by mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. For comparison,\nnon-hydrodynamic active Brownian particles (ABPs) are considered to elucidate\nthe contribution of hydrodynamic interactions on MIC and MIPS. For spherical\nparticles, the comparison between ABP and hydrodynamic-squirmer ensembles\nreveals a suppression of MIPS due to hydrodynamic interactions. The fundamental\ndifference between ABPs and squirmers is attributed to an increased\nreorientation of squirmers by hydrodynamic torques during their collisions. In\ncontrast, for elongated squirmers, hydrodynamics interactions enhance MIPS.\nThus, hydrodynamic interactions show opposing effects on MIPS for spherical and\nelongated microswimmers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 14:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The\nequations commonly used to interpret this experiment, however, rely on two\nhidden assumptions: (1) the tip charge oscillates in phase with the cantilever\nmotion to keep the tip voltage constant, and (2) any changes in the tip-sample\ninteraction happen slowly. Starting from an electro-mechanical model of the\ncantilever-sample interaction, we use Lagrangian mechanics to derive coupled\nequations of motion for the cantilever position and charge. This general\napproach rigorously describes scanned probe experiments even in the case when\nthe usual assumptions of fast tip charging and slowly changing samples\nproperties are violated.

Moreover, being critical, these systems are\nalso exposed to significant security threats. This threat combination increases\nthe risk of physical damage. This paper addresses these problems by studying\nhow to build the first real-time Byzantine reliable broadcast protocol (RTBRB)\ntolerating network uncertainties, faults, and attacks. Previous literature\ndescribes either real-time reliable broadcast protocols, or asynchronous (non\nreal-time) Byzantine~ones.\n  We first prove that it is impossible to implement RTBRB using traditional\ndistributed computing paradigms, e.g., where the error/failure detection\nmechanisms of processes are decoupled from the broadcast algorithm itself, even\nwith the help of the most powerful failure detectors. We circumvent this\nimpossibility by proposing RT-ByzCast, an algorithm based on aggregating\ndigital signatures in a sliding time-window and on empowering processes with\nself-crashing capabilities to mask and bound losses. We show that RT-ByzCast\n(i) operates in real-time by proving that messages broadcast by correct\nprocesses are delivered within a known bounded delay, and (ii) is reliable by\ndemonstrating that correct processes using our algorithm crash themselves with\na negligible probability, even with message loss rates as high as 60%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 15:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

More\nspecifically, we propose a quantum GAN for generating classical discrete\ndistribution, which has a classical-quantum hybrid architecture and is composed\nof a parameterized quantum circuit as the generator and a classical neural\nnetwork as the discriminator. The parameterized quantum circuit only consists\nof simple one-qubit rotation gates and two-qubit controlled-phase gates that\nare available in current quantum devices. Our scheme has the following\ncharacteristics and potential advantages: (i) It is intrinsically capable of\ngenerating discrete data (e.g., text data), while classical GANs are clumsy for\nthis task due to the vanishing gradient problem. (ii) Our scheme avoids the\ninput/output bottlenecks embarrassing most of the existing quantum learning\nalgorithms that either require to encode the classical input data into quantum\nstates, or output a quantum state corresponding to the solution instead of\ngiving the solution itself, which inevitably compromises the speedup of the\nquantum algorithm. (iii) The probability distribution implicitly given by data\nsamples can be loaded into a quantum state, which may be useful for some\nfurther applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 15:18:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 09:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 15:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 09:09:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 02:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 07:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

The basis of our approach is\nthe notion of leak competitiveness, which compares the leakage of two cache\nalgorithms on every possible program. Based on this notion, we prove the\nfollowing two results:\n  First, we show that leak competitiveness is symmetric in the cache\nalgorithms. This implies that no cache algorithm dominates another in terms of\nleakage via a program's total execution time. This is in contrast to\nperformance, where it is known that such dominance relationships exist.\n  Second, when restricted to caches with finite control, the\nleak-competitiveness relationship between two cache algorithms is either\nasymptotically linear or constant.

Multiple flare ribbons are observed, whose\nevolution indicates a two-stage energy release process. A non-linear force-free\nfield (NLFFF) extrapolation reveals the existence of a magnetic null point, a\nfan-spine structure, and two flux ropes embedded in the fan dome. Magnetic\nreconnections involved in the flare are driven by the destabilization and rise\nof one of the flux ropes. In the first stage, the fast ascending flux rope\ndrives reconnections at the null point and the surrounding quasi-separatrix\nlayer (QSL), while in the second stage, reconnection mainly occurs between the\ntwo legs of the field lines stretched by the eventually stopped flux rope. The\nlate-phase loops are mainly produced by the first-stage QSL reconnection, while\nthe second-stage reconnection is responsible for the heating of main flaring\nloops. The first-stage reconnection is believed to be more powerful, leading to\nan extremely strong EUV late phase. We find that the delayed occurrence of the\nlate-phase peak is mainly due to the long cooling process of the long\nlate-phase loops. Using the model enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops\n(EBTEL), we model the EUV emissions from a late-phase loop. The modeling\nreveals a peak heating rate of 1.1~erg~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$ for the late-phase\nloop, which is obviously higher than previous values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 09:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 03:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Such models are useful in the study\nof the structure and growth dynamics of gene regulatory networks and scientific\ncitation networks. Starting from an initial seed network, at each time step a\nrandom node, a mother node, is selected for duplication. Its daughter node is\nadded to the network and duplicates each outgoing link of the mother node with\nprobability p. In addition, the daughter node forms a directed link to the\nmother node itself. We obtain analytical results for the in-degree distribution\n$P_t(K_{in}=k)$, and for the out-degree distribution $P_t(K_{out}=k)$ at time\nt. The in-degrees follow a shifted power-law, so the network is asymptotically\nscale free. In contrast, the out-degree distribution is narrow, and converges\nto a Poisson distribution in the sparse network limit and to a Gaussian\ndistribution in the dense network limit. Such distinction between a broad\nin-degree distribution and a narrow out-degree distribution is common in\nempirical networks such as scientific citation networks. Using this we\ncalculate the mean degree $\\langle K_{in}\\rangle_t=\\langle K_{out}\\rangle_t$,\nwhich converges to $1/(1-p)$ in the large network limit, for the whole range of\n$0<p<1$.

These\nexperiments pave the way to the systematic studies of entropy in various\ncrystal systems including novel two-dimensional crystals such as gapped\ngraphene, germanene and silicene. Theoretically, the entropy per particle is\nlinked to the temperature derivative of the chemical potential of the electron\ngas by the Maxwell relation. Using this relation, we calculate the entropy per\nparticle in the vicinity of topological transitions in various two-dimensional\nelectronic systems. We show that the entropy experiences quantized steps at the\npoints of Lifshitz transitions in a two-dimensional electronic gas with a\nparabolic energy spectrum. In contrast, in doubled-gapped Dirac materials, the\nentropy per particles demonstrates characteristic spikes once the chemical\npotential passes through the band edges.

This paper\npartitions variation in height-for-age that is specifically associated with\ndeprivation and health outcomes to provide a basis for cross-population\ncomparisons.\n  Materials & Methods: Using a multi-level model with a sigmoid relationship of\nresources and growth, we partition variation in height-for-age z-scores (HAZ)\nfrom 1,522,564 children across 70 countries into two components: 1) \"accrued\nHAZ\" shaped by environmental inputs (e.g., undernutrition, infectious disease,\ninadequate sanitation, poverty), and 2) a country-specific \"basal HAZ\"\nindependent of such inputs. We validate these components against\npopulation-level infant mortality rates, and assess how these basal differences\nmay affect cross-population comparisons of stunting.\n  Results: Basal HAZ differs reliably across countries (range of 1.5 SD) and is\nindependent of measures of infant mortality. By contrast, accrued HAZ captures\nstunting as impaired growth due to deprivation and is more closely associated\nwith infant mortality than observed HAZ. Ranking populations by accrued HAZ\nsuggest that populations in West Africa and the Caribbean suffer much greater\nlevels of stunting than suggested by observed HAZ.\n  Discussion: Current universal standards may dramatically underestimate\nstunting in populations with taller basal HAZ. Relying on observed HAZ rather\nthan accrued HAZ may also lead to inappropriate cross-population comparisons,\nsuch as concluding that Haitian children enjoy better conditions for growth\nthan do Indian or Guatemalan children.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2018 20:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 20:42:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 20:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2019 00:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

This paper describes further work on the first\nexperiments of a closed-loop robotic system integrating a CNN together with a\nDynamic and Active Pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) in a predator/prey scenario. The\nDAVIS, mounted on the predator Summit XL robot, produces frames at a fixed 15\nHz frame-rate and Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) histograms containing 5k ON and\nOFF events at a variable frame-rate ranging from 15-500 Hz depending on the\nrobot speeds. In contrast to conventional frame-based systems, the latency and\nprocessing cost depends on the rate of change of the image. The CNN is trained\noffline on the 1.25h labeled dataset to recognize the position and size of the\nprey robot, in the field of view of the predator. During inference, combining\nthe ten output classes of the CNN allows extracting the analog position vector\nof the prey relative to the predator with a mean 8.7% error in angular\nestimation.
