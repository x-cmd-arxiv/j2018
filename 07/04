While\nthe realization of QSH has demonstrated the nontrivial topology of the electron\nwavefunctions of monolayer WTe$_2$, the geometrical properties of the\nwavefunction, such as the Berry curvature, remain unstudied. On the other hand,\nit has been increasingly recognized that the Berry curvature plays an important\nrole in multiple areas of condensed matter physics including nonreciprocal\nelectron transport, enantioselective optical responses, chiral polaritons and\neven unconventional superconductivity.

Elucidating this issue is a major challenge since it would require a\nlarge number of samples where structure properties or the carrier density is\nsystematically varied. FeSe, with its structural simplicity, is an ideal\nplatform for addressing this question. It has been demonstrated that the\nsuperconductivity in this material can be controlled through crystal lattice\ntuning, as well as electronic structure manipulation. Here, we apply a\nhigh-throughput methodology to FeSe to systematically delineate the\ninterdependence of its structural and electronic properties. Using a dual-beam\npulsed laser deposition, we have generated FeSe films with a marked gradient in\nthe superconducting transition temperature (below 2 K < Tc < 12 K) across 1 cm\nwidth of the films. The Tc gradient films display ~ 1% continuous stretch and\ncompression in the out-of-plane and in-plane lattice constants respectively,\ntriggering the continuous enhancement of superconductivity. Combining transport\nand angular-resolved photoemission measurements on uniform FeSe films with\ntunable Tc from 3 K to 14 K, we find that the electron carrier density is\nintimately correlated with Tc, i.e., it increases by a factor of 6 and\nultimately surpasses the almost constant hole concentration.

Usually, the KL instability takes place at\nextremely low energy scales, but in TBG, a doubling and subsequent strong\ncoupling of the van Hove singularities (vHS) in the electronic spectrum occurs\nas the magic angle is approached, leading to extended saddle points in the\nhighest valence band (VB) with almost perfect nesting between states belonging\nto different valleys. The highly anisotropic screening induces an effective\nattraction in a $p$-wave channel with odd parity under the exchange of the two\ndisjoined patches of the Fermi line. We also predict the appearance of a\nspin-density wave (SDW) instability, adjacent to the superconducting phase, and\nthe opening of a gap in the electronic spectrum from the condensation of spins\nwith wave vector corresponding to the nesting vector close to the vHS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 16:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 11:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that an agent\ncan achieve human-level in a popular 3D multiplayer first-person video game,\nQuake III Arena Capture the Flag, using only pixels and game points as input.\nThese results were achieved by a novel two-tier optimisation process in which a\npopulation of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of\nparallel matches with agents playing in teams together and against each other\non randomly generated environments. Each agent in the population learns its own\ninternal reward signal to complement the sparse delayed reward from winning,\nand selects actions using a novel temporally hierarchical representation that\nenables the agent to reason at multiple timescales. During game-play, these\nagents display human-like behaviours such as navigating, following, and\ndefending based on a rich learned representation that is shown to encode\nhigh-level game knowledge. In an extensive tournament-style evaluation the\ntrained agents exceeded the win-rate of strong human players both as teammates\nand opponents, and proved far stronger than existing state-of-the-art agents.\nThese results demonstrate a significant jump in the capabilities of artificial\nagents, bringing us closer to the goal of human-level intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 16:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

To do so we perform the canonical formulation\nof the anisotropic conformal theory at the classical level with a general\nconformal potential. Both theories have the generator of the anisotropic Weyl\ntransformations as a constraint but it changes from first to second-class when\nthe Weyl symmetry is broken. The FDiff-covariant vector a_i = \\partial_i \\ln N\nplays the role of gauge connection for the anisotropic Weyl transformations. A\nLagrange multiplier plays also the role of gauge connection, being the time\ncomponent. The anisotropic conformal theory propagates the same number of\ndegrees of freedom of the kinetic-conformal theory, which in turn are the same\nof General Relativity. This is due to exchange of a second-class constraint in\nthe kinetic-conformal case by a gauge symmetry in the anisotropic conformal\ncase. An exception occurs if the conformal potential does not depend on the\nlapse function N, as is the case of the so called Cotton^2 potential, in which\ncase one of the physical modes becomes odd. We develop in detail two explicit\nanisotropic conformal models. One of them depends on N whereas the other one is\nthe Cotton^2 model. We also study conformally flat solutions in the anisotropic\nconformal and the kinetic-conformal theories, defining as conformally flat the\nspatial metric, but leaving for N a form different to the one dictated by the\nanisotropic Weyl transformations. We find that in both theories these\nconfigurations have vanishing canonical momentum and they are critical points\nof the potential. In the kinetic-conformal theory we find explicitly an exact,\nnontrivial, conformally flat solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 17:24:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 22:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 21:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

In this paper we introduce a variant of the AMP algorithm that\ntakes into account glassy nature of the system under consideration. We coin\nthis algorithm as the approximate survey propagation (ASP) and derive it for a\nclass of low-rank matrix estimation problems. We derive the state evolution for\nthe ASP algorithm and prove that it reproduces the one-step replica symmetry\nbreaking (1RSB) fixed-point equations, well-known in physics of disordered\nsystems. Our derivation thus gives a concrete algorithmic meaning to the 1RSB\nequations that is of independent interest. We characterize the performance of\nASP in terms of convergence and mean-squared error as a function of the free\nParisi parameter s. We conclude that when there is a model mismatch between the\ntrue generative model and the inference model, the performance of AMP rapidly\ndegrades both in terms of MSE and of convergence, while ASP converges in a\nlarger regime and can reach lower errors. Among other results, our analysis\nleads us to a striking hypothesis that whenever s (or other parameters) can be\nset in such a way that the Nishimori condition $M=Q>0$ is restored, then the\ncorresponding algorithm is able to reach mean-squared error as low as the\nBayes-optimal error obtained when the model and its parameters are known and\nexactly matched in the inference procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 17:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

To address this question, we focused on a central problem in biology:\npredicting how proteins interact with one another---that is, which surfaces of\none protein bind to those of another protein.

This may\nhave tremendous implications for our understanding of the first stars,\ngravitational wave events, and supernovae. A key question here is whether all\nevolved massive stars passing through the blue supergiant phase are dormant S\nDor variables transforming during a brief period, or whether LBVs are truly\nunique objects. By investigating the OGLE light-curves of 64 B supergiants\n(Bsgs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) on a timescale of three years with a\ncadence of one night, the incidence of S Dor variables amongst the Bsgs\npopulation is investigated.

To further constrain these scenarios,\nwe investigate the evolution of small-scale density perturbations during such a\nperiod of kination. We determine that once a perturbation mode enters the\nhorizon during kination, the gravitational potential drops sharply and begins\nto oscillate and decay. Nevertheless, dark matter density perturbations that\nenter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor\nprior to the onset of radiation domination. Consequently, kination leaves a\ndistinctive imprint on the matter power spectrum: scales that enter the horizon\nduring kination have enhanced inhomogeneity.

We find that matter density\nperturbations do not grow if they enter the horizon when ${0< w < 1/3}$. If\nmatter density perturbations enter the horizon when ${w > 1/3}$, their growth\nis faster than the logarithmic growth experienced during radiation domination.\nThe resulting boost to the small-scale matter power spectrum leads to the\nformation of enhanced substructure, which effectively increases the dark matter\nannihilation rate and could make thermal dark matter production during an era\nof kination incompatible with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 18:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

While\nSaturn is the only giant planet whose Trojans are not discovered until now, we\nidentify some small bodies among Centaurs and Damocloids that are potentially\nin 1/-1 resonance with Saturn in the present study. Methods. We integrate\nnumerically the motion of the 1000 clones (include the nominal orbit) of each\nCentaur whose orbit has a semi-major axis between 9.3 au and 9.8 au and an\ninclination i > 90 deg. To confirm and evaluate the 1/-1 resonant\nconfigurations mentioned above, we introduce a useful one-degree integrable\napproximation for planar 1/-1 resonance. Results. We identify four candidates\npotentially in 1/-1 resonance with Saturn. The capture in this particular\nresonant state during the 40000 yr integration timespan is very common for 2006\nRJ2 (906/1000 clones), 2006 BZ8 (878/1000 clones), and 2017 SV13 (998/1000\nclones), and it is less likely for 2012 YE8 (426/1000 clones).

Two machine learning and natural language processing\ntechniques are demonstrated: one relying on feature engineering (COTA v1) and\nthe other exploiting raw signals through deep learning architectures (COTA v2).\nCOTA v1 employs a new approach that converts the multi-classification task into\na ranking problem, demonstrating significantly better performance in the case\nof thousands of classes. For COTA v2, we propose an Encoder-Combiner-Decoder, a\nnovel deep learning architecture that allows for heterogeneous input and output\nfeature types and injection of prior knowledge through network architecture\nchoices. This paper compares these models and their variants on the task of\nticket classification and answer selection, showing model COTA v2 outperforms\nCOTA v1, and analyzes their inner workings and shortcomings.

Nonetheless, such advantages come at the cost of sacrificing\nprogrammability. FPGA vendors and researchers attempt to improve the\nprogrammability through high-level synthesis (HLS) technologies that can\ndirectly generate hardware circuits from high-level language descriptions.\nHowever, reading through recent publications on FPGA designs using HLS, one\noften gets the impression that FPGA programming is still hard in that it leaves\nprogrammers to explore a very large design space with many possible\ncombinations of HLS optimization strategies.\n  In this paper we make two important observations and contributions. First, we\ndemonstrate a rather surprising result: FPGA programming can be made easy by\nfollowing a simple best-effort guideline of five refinement steps using HLS. We\nshow that for a broad class of accelerator benchmarks from MachSuite, the\nproposed best-effort guideline improves the FPGA accelerator performance by\n42-29,030x. Compared to the baseline CPU performance, the FPGA accelerator\nperformance is improved from an average 292.5x slowdown to an average 34.4x\nspeedup. Moreover, we show that the refinement steps in the best-effort\nguideline, consisting of explicit data caching, customized pipelining,\nprocessing element duplication, computation/communication overlapping and\nscratchpad reorganization, correspond well to the best practice guidelines for\nmulticore CPU programming. Although our best-effort guideline may not always\nlead to the optimal solution, it substantially simplifies the FPGA programming\neffort, and will greatly support the wide adoption of FPGA-based acceleration\nby the software programming community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 18:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

In theoretical\nanalyses, it is usual to consider the emitter as isolated, i.e, a single tip\nfield emitter infinitely far from any physical boundary, except the substrate.\nHowever, simulation domains must be finite and the simulation boundaries\ninfluences the electrostatic potential distribution. In either finite elements\nor finite differences techniques, there is a systematic error ($\\epsilon$) in\nthe FEF caused by the finite size of the simulation domain. It is attempting to\noversize the domain to avoid any influence from the boundaries, however, the\ncomputation might become memory and time consuming, especially in full three\ndimensional analyses. In this work, we provide the minimum width and height of\nthe simulation domain necessary to evaluate the FEF with $\\epsilon$ at the\ndesired tolerance. The minimum width ($A$) and height ($B$) are given relative\nto the height of the emitter ($h$), that is, $(A/h)_{min} \\times (B/h)_{min}$\nnecessary to simulate isolated emitters on a substrate. We also provide the\n$(B/h)_{min}$ to simulate arrays and the $(A/h)_{min}$ to simulate an emitter\nbetween an anode-cathode planar capacitor.

Most remarkably, a gradient flow\ntheorem in Hadamard spaces was used to attack a conjecture of Donaldson in\nKahler geometry.

Their main advantage is that they\ncompute matrix-vector products in constant time, irrespective of the size of\nthe matrix. However, early convolution layers in ConvNets map very unfavorably\nonto analog arrays, because kernel matrices are typically small and the\nconstant time operation needs to be sequentially iterated a large number of\ntimes, reducing the speed up advantage for ConvNets. Here, we propose to\nreplicate the kernel matrix of a convolution layer on distinct analog arrays,\nand randomly divide parts of the compute among them, so that multiple kernel\nmatrices are trained in parallel. With this modification, analog arrays execute\nConvNets with an acceleration factor that is proportional to the number of\nkernel matrices used per layer (here tested 16-128). Despite having more free\nparameters, we show analytically and in numerical experiments that this\nconvolution architecture is self-regularizing and implicitly learns similar\nfilters across arrays. We also report superior performance on a number of\ndatasets and increased robustness to adversarial attacks. Our investigation\nsuggests to revise the notion that mixed analog-digital hardware is not\nsuitable for ConvNets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 19:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

The UV emission, revealed by GALEX,\nextends well beyond the optical disk, after the drop of H$\\alpha$ emission, the\nusual tracer of star formation. This shows that sporadic star formation can\noccur in a large fraction of the HI disk, at radii up to 3 or 4 times the\noptical radius. In most galaxies, these regions are poor in stars and dominated\nby under-recycled gas, therefore bear some similarity to early stages of spiral\ngalaxies and high-redshift galaxies.\n  One remarkable example is M83, a nearby galaxy with an extended UV disk\nreaching 2 times the optical radius. It offers the opportunity to search for\nthe molecular gas and characterise the star formation in outer disk regions,\ntraced by the UV emission. We obtained CO(2-1) observations with\n  ALMA of a small region in a 1.5'$\\times$ 3' rectangle located at\n$r_{gal}=7.85'$ over a bright UV region of M83. There is no CO detection, in\nspite of the abundance of HI gas, and the presence of young stars traced by\ntheir HII regions. Our spatial resolution (17pc x 13pc) was perfectly fitted to\ndetect Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC), but none were detected. The corresponding\nupper limits occur in an SFR region of the Kennicutt-Schmidt diagram where\ndense molecular clouds are expected. Stacking our data over HI-rich regions,\nusing the observed HI velocity, we obtain a tentative detection, corresponding\nto an H$_2$-to-HI mass ratio of $<$ 3 $\\times$ 10$^{-2}$. A possible\nexplanation is that the expected molecular clouds are CO-dark, because of the\nstrong UV radiation field. The latter preferentially dissociates CO with\nrespect to H$_2$, due to the small size of the star forming clumps in the outer\nregions of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 21:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

The abundance of Nitric Oxide (NO), a minor species in the\nthermosphere, is an important component of energy balance here because its\nproduction comes from energy sources able to break the strong bond of molecular\nnitrogen, and infrared emissions from NO play an important role in\nthermospheric cooling. Recent studies have significantly improved our\nunderstanding of NO chemistry and its relationship to energy deposition in the\nthermospheric photochemical reactions. In this study, the chemical scheme in\nthe Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) is updated to better predict\nthe lower thermospheric NO responses to solar and geomagnetic activity. We\ninvestigate the sensitivity of the 5.3-micron NO emission to F10.7 and Ap\nindices by comparing the global integrated emission from GITM with an empirical\nproxy derived from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission\nRadiometry measurements. GITM's total emission agrees well within 20% of the\nempirical values. The updated chemistry scheme significantly elevates the level\nof integrated emission compared to the previous scheme.

Its exponent (n) is generally determined by fitting the power-law\nfunction to experimental observations measured at various scales. Invoking\nconcepts from fractal geometry we theoretically show, as a first- order\napproximation, that the fracture aperture should be a linear function of its\nwidth, meaning that n = 1. This finding is in agreement with the result of\nlinear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory. We compare the model\npredictions with experimental observations available in the literature. This\ncomparison generally supports a linear relationship between fracture aperture\nand fracture width, although there exists considerable scatter in the data.

Thus, mapping these networks into a low-dimensional space to\nvisualize the dynamics of network-driven processes is a challenging task. Often\nwe want to analyze how a single node is influenced by or is influencing its\nlocal network as the source of a spreading process. Here I present a network\nlayout algorithm for graphs with millions of nodes that visualizes spreading\nphenomena from the perspective of a single node. The algorithm consists of\nthree stages to allow for an interactive graph exploration: First, a global\nsolution for the network layout is found in spherical space that minimizes\ndistance errors between all nodes. Second, a focal node is interactively\nselected, and distances to this node are further optimized. Third, node\ncoordinates are mapped to a circular representation and drawn with additional\nfeatures to represent the network-driven phenomenon.

Standard template fitting delivers interpretable\nmodels and errors, but lacks flexibility to learn inaccuracies in the observed\nphotometry or the spectral templates. Machine learning addresses those issues,\nbut requires representative training data, and the resulting models and\nuncertainties cannot be interpreted in the context of a physical model or\noutside of the training data. We present a hierarchical modeling approach\nsimultaneously addressing the issues of flexibility, interpretability, and\ngeneralization. It combines template fitting with flexible (machine\nlearning-like) models to correct the spectral templates, model their redshift\ndistributions, and recalibrate the photometric observations. By optimizing the\nfull posterior distribution of the model and solving for its (thousands of)\nparameters, one can perform a global statistical calibration of the data and\nthe SED model. We apply this approach to the public Dark Energy Survey Science\nVerification data, and show that it provides more accurate and compact redshift\nposterior distributions than existing methods, as well as insights into\nresidual photometric and SED systematics. The model is causal, makes\npredictions for future data (e.g., additional photometric bandpasses), and its\ninternal parameters and components are interpretable.

The temperature dependence of the\norder-disorder transition also broadens and shifts to lower temperature in a\nnonlinear manner as the nanoscale is approached from above. We find that\nligands on nanoscale facets can behave very similarly to those on macroscopic\nsurfaces in solution, and that some facet dimensions affect the ligand\nalignment more strongly than others. As the ligands order, the interaction\nbetween opposing monolayers becomes attractive, even well below full surface\ncoverage. The strength of attraction per unit surface area is strongly affected\nby ligand coverage, but only weakly by facet width. Conversely, we find that\nbringing two monolayers together just above the order-disorder transition\ntemperature can induce ordering and attraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 00:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

Goodey proved the\nconjecture for the intersection of the two classes. We examine these classes\nfrom the point of view of distance-two colorings. A distance-two $r$-coloring\nof a graph $G$ is an assignment of $r$ colors to the vertices of $G$ so that\nany two vertices at distance at most two have different colors. Note that a\ncubic graph needs at least four colors. The distance-two four-coloring problem\nfor cubic planar graphs is known to be NP-complete. We claim the problem\nremains NP-complete for tri-connected bipartite cubic planar graphs, which we\ncall type-one Barnette graphs, since they are the first class identified by\nBarnette. By contrast, we claim the problem is polynomial for cubic plane\ngraphs with face sizes $3, 4, 5,$ or $6$, which we call type-two Barnette\ngraphs, because of their relation to Barnette's second conjecture. We call\nGoodey graphs those type-two Barnette graphs all of whose faces have size $4$\nor $6$. We fully describe all Goodey graphs that admit a distance-two\nfour-coloring, and characterize the remaining type-two Barnette graphs that\nadmit a distance-two four-coloring according to their face size.\n  For quartic plane graphs, the analogue of type-two Barnette graphs are graphs\nwith face sizes $3$ or $4$. For this class, the distance-two four-coloring\nproblem is also polynomial; in fact, we can again fully describe all colorable\ninstances -- there are exactly two such graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 00:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

In the existing methods, the image of\nintermediate style between the content and the target style is obtained by\ndecoding a linearly interpolated feature in encoded feature space. However,\nthere has been no work on analyzing the effectiveness of this kind of style\nstrength interpolation so far. In this paper, we tackle the missing work on the\nin-depth analysis of style interpolation and propose a method that is more\neffective in controlling style strength. We interpret the training task of a\nstyle transfer network as a regression learning between the control parameter\nand output style strength. In this understanding, the existing methods are\nbiased due to the fact that training is performed with one-sided data of full\nstyle strength (alpha = 1.0). Thus, this biased learning does not guarantee the\ngeneration of a desired intermediate style corresponding to the style control\nparameter between 0.0 and 1.0. To solve this problem of the biased network, we\npropose an unbiased learning technique which uses unbiased training data and\ncorresponding unbiased loss for alpha = 0.0 to make the feed-forward networks\nto generate a zero-style image, i.e., content image when alpha = 0.0. Our\nexperimental results verified that our unbiased learning method achieved the\nreconstruction of a content image with zero style strength, better regression\nspecification between style control parameter and output style, and more stable\nstyle transfer that is insensitive to the weight of style loss without additive\ncomplexity in image generating process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 01:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 09:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-06"}

It is thus\nhypothesized that particles are accelerated at the shock driven by the coronal\nmass ejection (CME) and then travel from the shock downstream back to the front\nside of the Sun to produce the observed $\\gamma$-rays. To test this scenario,\nwe performed data-driven, global magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the CME\nassociated with a well-observed BTL flare on 2014 September 1.

Moreover, the observed increase in $\\gamma$-ray flux is temporally\ncorrelated with (1) the increase of the shock compression ratio and (2) the\npresence of a quasi-perpendicular shock over the area that is magnetically\nconnected to the $\\gamma$-ray emitting region, both conditions favoring the\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of particles.

In this work, we develop such a theory for a\nnew class of deterministic individual based models describing individual births\nand deaths, which captures the essential features of standard stochastic\nindividual-based models and become identical with the latter under maximal\ncompetition. The key motivation is to derive the canonical equation of adaptive\ndynamics from this microscopic ecological model, which can be regarded as a\n\"toy model\" for evolution, in a simple way and give it an intuitive geometric\ninterpretation. Another goal is to study evolution and sympatric speciation\nunder \"maximal\" competition. We show that these models, in the deterministic\nlimit of adaptive dynamics, lead to the same equations that describe the\nunraveling of the mean evolutionary trajectory as those obtained from the\nstandard stochastic models. We further study conditions under which these\nmodels lead to evolutionary branching and find them to be similar with those\nobtained from the standard stochastic models. We find that though deterministic\nmodels result in a strong competition that leads to a speed up in the temporal\ndynamics of a population cloud in the phenotypic space as well as an increase\nin the rate of generation of biodiversity, it does not seem to result in an\nabsolute increase in biodiversity as far as total number of species are\nconcerned. Hence, the \"toy model\" essentially captures all the features of the\nstandard stochastic model. Interestingly, the notion of a fitness function does\nnot explicitly enter in our derivation of the canonical equation, thereby\nadvocating a mechanistic view of evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 06:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

Beginning with the kinetic quantum\nplasma longitudinal susceptibility, we assess the effects due to increasing\ncomplexity of the background distribution function. Firstly, we analyse\ndispersion and Landau damping in one-component plasmas and consider\ndistribution functions with a variety of analytical properties: the Dirac delta\nfunction, the Cauchy profile with two complex first-order poles, the squared\nCauchy profile with two second order poles, and the inverse-quartic profile\nwith four first-order poles; we also briefly discuss the non-meromorphic\ntotally- and arbitrarily-degenerate Fermi-Dirac distribution.

We obtain the corresponding\nlinear kinetic dispersion relations and evaluate the properties of\ninstabilities when the electron distribution functions are of the delta\nfunction, Cauchy, squared-Cauchy, or inverse-quartic types. In agreement with\nother studies, we find that in general quantum effects reduce the range of\nwavelengths for unstable modes at long wavelengths.

However, the existing general\nhashing methods have limited discriminative power for describing fine-grained\nobjects that share similar overall appearance but have subtle difference. To\nsolve this problem, we for the first time introduce the attention mechanism to\nthe learning of fine-grained hashing codes. Specifically, we propose a novel\ndeep hashing model, named deep saliency hashing (DSaH), which automatically\nmines salient regions and learns semantic-preserving hashing codes\nsimultaneously. DSaH is a two-step end-to-end model consisting of an attention\nnetwork and a hashing network. Our loss function contains three basic\ncomponents, including the semantic loss, the saliency loss, and the\nquantization loss. As the core of DSaH, the saliency loss guides the attention\nnetwork to mine discriminative regions from pairs of images. We conduct\nextensive experiments on both fine-grained and general retrieval datasets for\nperformance evaluation. Experimental results on fine-grained datasets,\nincluding Oxford Flowers-17, Stanford Dogs-120, and CUB Bird demonstrate that\nour DSaH performs the best for fine-grained retrieval task and beats the\nstrongest competitor (DTQ) by approximately 10% on both Stanford Dogs-120 and\nCUB Bird.

The star is evolved from the pre-main-sequence (PMS) up to the tip\nof the red giant branch. We used these models as input for computing the\nevolution of the planetary orbits. We explored the effects of changing the\nplanet masses (of 1 Earth mass up to 20 Jupiter masses), the distance between\nthe planet and the star (of 0.015 and more than 3 au), the mass, and the spin\nof the star. We present results when only the equilibrium tide was accounted\nfor and when both equilibrium and dynamical tides were accounted for. The\nexpression for the dynamical tide is a frequency-averaged dissipation of\ntidally excited inertial waves, obtained from a piecewise homogeneous two-layer\nstellar model. Gravity wave damping was neglected. Dynamical tides in\nconvective zones have a significant effect on planetary orbits only during the\nPMS phase and only for fast-rotating stars. They have no significant effects\nduring the PMS phase for initially slow-rotating stars and during the red giant\nbranch phase, regardless of the initial rotation (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 08:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

HI absorption is a powerful tracer on all scales,\nfrom the pc scales to many tens of kpc. Given the strong radio continuum often\nassociated with the central activity, HI absorption can be used to study the HI\nnear an AGN out to much higher redshifts than is possible using HI emission. HI\nabsorption has been used to characterise the general ISM in active galaxies, to\ntrace the fuelling of radio-loud AGN, to study the feedback between the energy\nreleased by the AGN and the ISM, and the impact of such interactions on the\nevolution of galaxies and their AGN. In the last two decades, significant\nprogress has been made in all these areas. It is now well established that many\nradio loud AGN are surrounded by small, regularly rotating gas disks that\ncontain a significant fraction of HI. The structure of these disks has been\ntraced down to parsec scales by VLBI observations. Young and recently restarted\nradio galaxies appear to have a high detection rate of HI. This is interesting\nin connection with the evolution of these AGN. This is confirmed by the\ndiscovery of fast, AGN-driven outflows of cold gas which give a direct view of\nthe impact of the energy released by AGN. In addition, evidence has been\ncollected that clouds of cold gas can play a role in fuelling the nuclear\nactivity. This review ends by briefly describing the upcoming large, blind HI\nabsorption surveys planned for the new radio telescopes which will soon become\noperational. These surveys will allow to significantly expand existing work,\nbut will also allow to explore new topics, in particular the evolution of the\ncold ISM in AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 08:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Whereas networks in\nvitro develop strong bursts separated by periods of very little spiking\nactivity, in vivo cortical networks show continuous activity. This is puzzling\nconsidering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron dynamics\nand plasticity rules. We propose that the defining difference between in vitro\nand in vivo dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are\nvirtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input.\nWe analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by\nspike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state.\nIn more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network\ntopologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic\nplasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to\nclose-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the\ndynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the\ninput strengths. Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in\nvitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting behavior is consistent with a state\ngenerated by very low network input (< 0.1%), whereas in vivo activity suggests\nthat on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in\nreverberating dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the\nubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations, and instead impose dynamics\ncomparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term\nstimulation, thereby opening new paths to establish an in vivo-like assay in\nvitro for basic as well as neurological studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 08:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

We constrain the strength $\\Delta G/G_N$ and range\n$\\lambda_C$ of a chameleon- or symmetron-screened fifth force with Yukawa\ncoupling -- as well as an unscreened fifth force with differential coupling to\ngalactic mass components -- by searching for the displacement it predicts\nbetween galaxies' stellar and gas mass centroids. Taking data from the Alfalfa\nHI survey, identifying galaxies' gravitational environments with the maps of\nDesmond et al.

We introduce several estimates of the DAGN fraction and infer\npredictions for the activity levels and resolution limits usually involved in\nsurveys of these systems, assessing their dependence on the parameters\ncontrolling the length of both mergers and nuclear activity. Given a set of\nconstraints, we find that the values adopted for some of the latter factors\noften condition the outcomes from individual experiments. Still, the results do\nnot reveal, in general, very tight correlations, being the tendency of the\nfrequencies normalized to the merger time to anticorrelate with the orbital\ncircularity the clearest effect. In agreement with other theoretical studies,\nour simulations predict intrinsic abundances of these systems that range from\n$\\sim$few to $15\\%$ depending on the maximum level of nuclear activity\nachieved. At the same time, we show that these probabilities are reduced by\nabout an order of magnitude when they are filtered with the typical constraints\napplied by observational studies of the DAGN fraction at low redshift. As a\nwhole, the results of the present work prove that the consideration of the most\ncommon limitations involved in the detection of close active pairs at optical\nwavelengths is sufficient by itself to reconcile the intrinsic frequencies\nenvisaged in a hierarchical universe with the small fractions of double-peaked\nnarrow-line systems which are often reported at kpc-scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 09:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 12:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

This mechanism has not\nyet been studied theoretically. Our theoretical model provides a simple\ndescription of neuronal electrical activity that takes into account the tonic\nactivity of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors and a cytosolic calcium compartment.\nWe show that calcium influx mediated by the tonic activity of NMDA-R can be\ncoupled directly to the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels,\nresulting in an overall inhibitory effect on neuronal excitability.\nFurthermore, the presence of tonic NMDA-R activity promotes bistability in\nelectrical activity by dramatically increasing the stimulus interval where both\na stable steady state and repetitive firing can coexist.

We\nused uncorrelation loss, i.e., the total correlation coefficient between the\nresponses of different encoder channels, with style and content losses for\ntraining style transfer network. This makes the encoder network to be trained\nto generate inter-channel uncorrelated features and to be optimized for the\ntask of image style transfer which maintained the quality of image style only\nwith a light-weighted and correlation-unaware feature alignment process.\nMoreover, our method drastically reduced redundant channels of the encoded\nfeature and this resulted in the efficient size of structure of network and\nfaster forward processing speed.

Super point\ncardinality estimation plays important roles in network field. This paper\nproposes a super point cardinality estimation algorithm under sliding time\nwindow. To maintain the state of previous hosts with few updating operations, a\nnovel counter, asynchronous time stamp (AT), is proposed. For a sliding time\nwindow containing k time slices, AT only needs to be updated every k time\nslices at the cost of 1 more bit than a previous state-of-art counter which\nrequires $log_2(k+1)$ bits but updates every time slice. Fewer updating\noperations mean that more AT could be contained to acquire higher accuracy in\nreal-time. This paper also devises a novel reversible hash function scheme to\nrestore super point from a pool of AT.

The Euler characteristic is closely related to the homology of a space,\nas it can be expressed as the alternating sum of its Betti numbers, whenever\nthe sum is well-defined. Thus, one says that homology categorifies the Euler\ncharacteristic. In his work on the generalisation of cardinality-like\ninvariants, Leinster introduced the magnitude of a metric space, a real number\nthat counts the \"effective number of points\" of the space and has been shown to\nencode many invariants of metric spaces from integral geometry and geometric\nmeasure theory. In 2015, Hepworth and Willerton introduced a homology theory\nfor metric graphs, called magnitude homology, which categorifies the magnitude\nof a finite metric graph. This work was subsequently generalised to enriched\ncategories by Leinster and Shulman, and the homology theory that they\nintroduced categorifies magnitude for arbitrary finite metric spaces. When\nstudying a metric space, one is often only interested in the metric space up to\na rescaling of the distance of the points by a non-negative real number. The\nmagnitude function describes how the effective number of points changes as one\nscales the distance, and is completely encoded by magnitude homology. When\nstudying a finite metric space in topological data analysis using persistent\nhomology, one approximates the space through a nested sequence of simplicial\ncomplexes so as to recover topological information about the space by studying\nthe homology of this sequence. Here we relate magnitude homology and persistent\nhomology as two different ways of computing homology of filtered simplicial\nsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 12:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 18:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 08:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Furthermore, due to the presence of\na passive malicious node in nearby vicinity, the multi-hop UnderWater Acoustic\n(UWA) channel between a sensor node and the sink node is prone to eavesdropping\nattack on each hop.

By placing quantum field theories on a 4+1-D under Wick rotation to\n5-D, expectations of observables are calculated for a microcanonical field\ntheory averaging Hamiltonian flow over a fifth spacelike dimension, a technique\ncommon in lattice gauge simulations but not in perturbation theory. In a novel\ndemonstration, averaging pairs of external lines in the classical Feynman\ndiagrams over the fifth dimension generates diagrams with loops and vacuum\nfluctuations identical to Standard Model diagrams. Because it is\nmicrocanonical, this approach, while equivalent for standard quantum fields\ntheories in the Standard Model, is able to quantize theories that have no\ncanonical quantization. It is also unique in representing expectations as\naverages over solutions to an ordinary, classical PDE rather than a path\nintegral or operator based approaches. Hence, this approach draws a clear\nconnection between quantum field theory and classical field theory in higher\ndimensions which has implications towards how quantum effects are interpreted.\nIn particular, it raises questions about how violations of the ergodic\nhypothesis could influence quantum measurements even in standard,\nnon-statistical quantum field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 16:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 15:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Various solutions have been proposed in the past such as\nthe parametric approaches based on the least-squares fit of theoretical\ntemplates or the non-parametric techniques as the phase-folding method. Most of\nthem, however, are suited only for signals with specific time evolution. For\ngeneric signals the spectral approach based on the periodogram is potentially\nthe most effective. In astronomy the main problem in working with the\nperiodogram is that often the sampling of the signals is irregular. This\ncomplicates its efficient computation (the fast Fourier transform cannot be\ndirectly used) but overall the determination of its statistical\ncharacteristics. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) provides a solution to this\nlast important issue, but its main drawback is the assumption of a very\nspecific model of the datawhich is not correct for most of the practical\napplications. These issues are not always considered in literature with\ntheoretical and practical consequences of no easy solution. Moreover, apart\nfrom pathological samplings, it is common believe that the LSP and the\nclassical periodogram (CP) usually provide almost identical results. In\ngeneral, this is true but here it is shown that there are situations where the\nLSP is less effective than the CP in the detection of signals in noise. There\nare no compelling reasons, therefore, to use the LSP instead of the CP which is\ndirectly connected to the correlation function of the observed signal with the\nsinusoidal functions at the various frequencies of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 14:06:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 09:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

MXene surfaces are terminated by mixed\n-O, -F and -OH functional groups as a result of the chemical etching production\nprocess. These functional groups are known to be randomly distributed over the\nsurfaces, with limited experimental control over their composition. There is\nconsiderable debate regarding the contribution of these functional groups to\nthe properties of the underlying MXene material. For instance, their measured\nLi or Na capacity is far lower than that predicted by theoretical simulations,\nwhich generally assume uniformly terminated surfaces. The extent to which this\nstructural simplification contributes to such discrepancies is unknown. We\naddress this issue by employing first-principles calculations to compare the\nstructural, electronic and electrochemical properties of two common MXenes,\nnamely Ti3C2Tx and V2CTx, with both uniform terminating groups and explicitly\nmixed terminations. Weighted averages of uniformly-terminated layer properties\nare found to give excellent approximations to those of more realistic,\nrandomly-terminated structures. The sodium storage capacity and volume change\nduring sodiation in the interlayer space of these MXenes with mixed surface\nterminations are also investigated. The redox reaction is shown to be confined\nto the terminating groups for low concentrations of intercalated Na, with the\noxidation state of the metal atoms unaffected until higher concentrations of\nintercalated Na are achieved. Finally, the average open circuit voltage is\nshown to be very similar for both Ti3C2T2Na and V2CT2Na with mixed\nterminations, although it is highly sensitive to the particular composition of\nthe terminating groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 14:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

In this\npaper, we propose a new pipeline for pain expression recognition in neonates\nusing transfer learning. Specifically, we propose to exploit a pre-trained CNN\nthat was originally trained on a relatively similar dataset for face\nrecognition (VGG Face) as well as CNNs that were pre-trained on a relatively\ndifferent dataset for image classification (iVGG F,M, and S) to extract deep\nfeatures from neonates' faces. In the final stage, several supervised machine\nlearning classifiers are trained to classify neonates' facial expression into\npain or no pain expression. The proposed pipeline achieved, on a testing\ndataset, 0.841 AUC and 90.34 accuracy, which is approx. 7 higher than the\naccuracy of handcrafted traditional features. We also propose to combine deep\nfeatures with traditional features and hypothesize that the mixed features\nwould improve pain classification performance. Combining deep features with\ntraditional features achieved 92.71 accuracy and 0.948 AUC. These results show\nthat transfer learning, which is a faster and more practical option than\ntraining CNN from the scratch, can be used to extract useful features for pain\nexpression recognition in neonates.

A\ncognitive transmitter uses a pre-trained classifier to predict the current\nchannel status based on recent sensing results and decides whether to transmit\nor not, whereas a jammer collects channel status and ACKs to build a deep\nlearning classifier that reliably predicts the next successful transmissions\nand effectively jams them. This jamming approach is shown to reduce the\ntransmitter's performance much more severely compared with random or\nsensing-based jamming. The deep learning classification scores are used by the\njammer for power control subject to an average power constraint. Next, a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) is developed for the jammer to reduce the\ntime to collect the training dataset by augmenting it with synthetic samples.\nAs a defense scheme, the transmitter deliberately takes a small number of wrong\nactions in spectrum access (in form of a causative attack against the jammer)\nand therefore prevents the jammer from building a reliable classifier. The\ntransmitter systematically selects when to take wrong actions and adapts the\nlevel of defense to mislead the jammer into making prediction errors and\nconsequently increase its throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2018 23:17:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 17:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}
