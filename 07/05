However, such resistivity switching effects\nare often weak, and cannot be modulated by an external gate voltage - limiting\ntheir widespread usage. Using a back-gated 1T-TaS2/2H-MoS2 heterojunction, here\nwe show that the usual resistivity switching in TaS2 due to different phase\ntransitions is accompanied with a surprisingly strong modulation in the\nSchottky barrier height (SBH) at the TaS2/MoS2 interface - providing an\nadditional knob to control the degree of the phase-transition-driven\nresistivity switching by an external gate voltage. In particular, the\ncommensurate (C) to triclinic (T) phase transition results in an increase in\nthe SBH owing to a collapse of the Mott gap in TaS2. The change in SBH allows\nus to estimate an electrical Mott gap opening of ~71 +/- 7 meV in the C phase\nof TaS2. On the other hand, the nearly-commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC)\nphase transition results in a suppression in the SBH, and the heterojunction\nshows a gate-controlled resistivity switching up to 17.3, which is ~14.5 times\nhigher than that of standalone TaS2. The findings mark an important step\nforward showing a promising pathway to externally control as well as amplify\nthe CDW induced resistivity switching. This will boost device applications that\nexploit these phase transitions, such as ultra-broadband photodetection,\nnegative differential conductance, fast oscillator and threshold switching in\nneuromorphic circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 16:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 04:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

We\npresent the Ranked Reward (R2) algorithm which accomplishes this by ranking the\nrewards obtained by a single agent over multiple games to create a relative\nperformance metric. Results from applying the R2 algorithm to instances of a\ntwo-dimensional and three-dimensional bin packing problems show that it\noutperforms generic Monte Carlo tree search, heuristic algorithms and integer\nprogramming solvers. We also present an analysis of the ranked reward\nmechanism, in particular, the effects of problem instances with varying\ndifficulty and different ranking thresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 16:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 17:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 23:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

Overall, the test results indicate that the CWVR meets\nspecifications for dynamic range, channel isolation, and gain stability to be\ntested on an antenna. Future work consists of building more CWVRs and testing\nthe phase correlations on the VLA antennas to evaluate the use of WVR for not\nonly the VLA, but also the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 17:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Here the dynamics of a soft microgel made of\ninterpenetrated polymer networks of PNIPAM and PAAc is investigated through\nX-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy and Dynamic Light Scattering.

Despite its wide\nacceptance, it has a number of shortcomings, the most important of which are\n(i) the inability to distinguish very different RP curves, and (ii) the lack of\ndirectly measuring bounding box localization accuracy. In this paper, we\npropose 'Localization Recall Precision (LRP) Error', a new metric which we\nspecifically designed for object detection. LRP Error is composed of three\ncomponents related to localization, false negative (FN) rate and false positive\n(FP) rate. Based on LRP, we introduce the 'Optimal LRP', the minimum achievable\nLRP error representing the best achievable configuration of the detector in\nterms of recall-precision and the tightness of the boxes. In contrast to AP,\nwhich considers precisions over the entire recall domain, Optimal LRP\ndetermines the 'best' confidence score threshold for a class, which balances\nthe trade-off between localization and recall-precision. In our experiments, we\nshow that, for state-of-the-art object (SOTA) detectors, Optimal LRP provides\nricher and more discriminative information than AP. We also demonstrate that\nthe best confidence score thresholds vary significantly among classes and\ndetectors. Moreover, we present LRP results of a simple online video object\ndetector which uses a SOTA still image object detector and show that the\nclass-specific optimized thresholds increase the accuracy against the common\napproach of using a general threshold for all classes.

The mature\ndevelopment of this interdisciplinary field has resulted in significant\nadvances of wide interest to physics at several levels serving various\npurposes. The field has firmly demonstrated, that seemingly disparate physical\ndomains, such as quantum field theory and classical gravity, are related, and\nthat the EFT framework is a universal one, where it has been proven to supply a\nrobust methodology to boost progress in the development of PN theory. The\nreview is aimed at a broad audience, from general readers new to the field, to\nspecialists and experts in related subjects.\n  The review begins with an overview of the introduction of EFTs into classical\ngravity and their development. Then, the basic ideas, which form the conceptual\nfoundation of EFTs, are provided, and the strategy of a multi-stage EFT\nframework, which is utilized for the PN binary inspiral problem, is outlined.\nThe main body of the review is then dedicated to presenting in detail the study\nof each of the effective theories at each of the intermediate scales in the\nproblem, up to the actual GW observables. The review is concluded with the\nmultiple prospects of building on the progress in the field, and using further\nmodern field theory insights and tools, to specifically address the study of\nGWs, as well as to broadly expand our fundamental understanding of gauge and\ngravity theories across the classical and quantum regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 17:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 10:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

However, interpretation\nof these data requires that we understand the relationship between stellar\ndistributions in chemical and physical space, i.e., how similar in chemical\nabundance do we expect a pair of stars to be as a function of the distance\nbetween their formation sites. We investigate this question by simulating the\ngravitational collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud extracted from a\ngalaxy-scale simulation, seeded with chemical inhomogeneities with different\ninitial spatial scales. We follow the collapse from galactic scales down to\nresolutions scales of $\\approx 10^{-3}$ pc, and find that, during this process,\nturbulence mixes the metal patterns, reducing the abundance scatter initially\npresent in the gas by an amount that depends on the initial scale of\ninhomogeneity of each metal field. However, we find that regardless of the\ninitial spatial structure of the metals at the onset of collapse, the final\nstellar abundances are highly correlated on distances below a few pc, and\nnearly uncorrelated on larger distances. Consequently, the star formation\nprocess defines a natural size scale of $\\sim 1$ pc for chemically-homogenous\nstar clusters, suggesting that any clusters identified as homogenous in\nchemical space must have formed within $\\sim 1$ pc of one another. However, in\norder to distinguish different star clusters in chemical space, observations\nacross multiple elements will be required, and the elements that are likely to\nbe most efficient at separating distinct clusters in chemical space are those\nwhose correlation length in the ISM is of order tens of pc, comparable to the\nsizes of individual molecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Our analysis reveals that the AGN enhances the\nstar-formation of its host galaxy, when the galaxy lies below the main sequence\nand quenches the star-formation of the galaxy it lives in, when the host lies\nabove the main sequence.

We show\nthat some of these correlations can be interpreted from basic physical\nconstraints imposed on a simple Taylor expansion of the binding energy around\nsaturation density. In particular, we investigate the correlations among the\nfollowing empirical parameters: the symmetry energy $E_{sym}$, the slope and\ncurvature of the symmetry energy $L_{sym}$ and $K_{sym}$, and the curvature and\nskewness of the binding energy in symmetric matter $K_{sat}$ and $Q_{sat}$. The\nuncertainties on these correlations is estimated through analytical modelling\nas well as a meta-modelling analysis of the EoS subject to physical\nconstraints. We show that a huge dispersion of the correlations among low order\nempirical parameters is induced by the unknown higher order empirical\nparameters, such as $K_{sym}$ (second order) and $Q_{sat}$ and $Q_{sym}$ (third\norder). We also propose an explanation of the reason why $Q_{sat}$ is weakly\nconstrained by present experimental data.

Absorbing galaxies are selected via the detection of characteristic\nabsorption lines which their gas-rich media imprint in the spectra of distant\nlight-beacons.

We identify the absorbing galaxies by matching spectroscopic\nabsorption -and emission redshifts and from projected separations. Combining\nemission-line diagnostics with existing absorption spectroscopy and photometry\nof quasar-fields hosting metal-rich, damped absorbers, we compare our new\ndetections with reference samples and place them on scaling relations.

Both functionals play an\nimportant role respectively in Riemannian geometry (in the case of surfaces)\nand K\\\"ahler geometry. As an output, we obtain a path integral whose Weyl\nanomaly displays the standard Liouville anomaly plus an additional K-energy\nterm. Motivations come from theoretical physics where these type of path\nintegrals arise as a model for fluctuating metrics on surfaces when coupling\n(small) massive perturbations of conformal field theories to quantum gravity as\nadvocated by A.

When the\nenergy spectrum contains also a continuum set of eigenvalues then the bound\nstates, due to the driving, couple to the continuum and become quasi-bound\nresonances.

In this context, attenuation in SPECT is\nprimarily due to Compton scattering, where the probability of Compton scatter\nis proportional to the attenuation coefficient of the tissue and the energy of\nthe scattered photon and the scattering angle are related. Given this premise,\nwe investigate whether the SPECT scattered-photon data acquired in list-mode\n(LM) format and including the energy information can be used to estimate the\nattenuation map. For this purpose, we propose a Fisher-information-based method\nthat yields the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the task of jointly estimating the\nactivity/attenuation distribution using only the SPECT emission data. The\nproposed method is applied to analyze the information content of SPECT LM\nemission data in a 2D SPECT system using computational studies with digital\nphantoms for different photon-count levels. The results show that scattered\nphotons contain information to estimate the attenuation coefficients. An\nincrease in the number of detected photons leads to lower CRB for both the\nattenuation and activity coefficients. Also, the CRB obtained for the\nattenuation and activity coefficients is typically much lower than the true\nvalue of these coefficients. Further, processing the emission data in LM format\nyields a lower CRB in comparison to binning data. Finally, we observe that\nsystems with better energy resolution yield a lower CRB for the attenuation\ncoefficient. Overall, the results provide strong evidence that LM SPECT\nemission data, including the scattered photons, contains information to jointly\nestimate the activity and attenuation coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 20:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 00:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

However,\nunder abnormal conditions Ca leaks from the SR, decreasing heart contraction\namplitude and increasing risk of life-threatening arrhythmia. The mechanisms\nand regimes of SR operation generating the abnormal Ca leak remain unclear.\nHere we employed both numerical and analytical modeling to get mechanistic\ninsights into the emergent Ca leak phenomenon. Our numerical simulations using\na detailed realistic model of Ca release unit (CRU) reveal sharp transitions\nresulting in Ca leak. The emergence of leak is closely mapped mathematically to\nthe Ising model from statistical mechanics. The system steady-state behavior is\ndetermined by two aggregate parameters: the analogues of magnetic field ($h$)\nand the inverse temperature ($\\beta$) in the Ising model, for which we have\nexplicit formulas in terms of SR Ca and release channel opening/closing rates.\nThe classification of leak regimes takes the shape of a phase $\\beta$-$h$\ndiagram, with the regime boundaries occurring at $h$=0 and a critical value of\n$\\beta$ ($\\beta*$) which we estimate using a classical Ising model and mean\nfield theory. Our theory predicts that a synchronized Ca leak will occur when\n$h$>0 and $\\beta>\\beta*$ and a disordered leak occurs when $\\beta<\\beta*$ and\n$h$ is not too negative. The disorder leak is distinguished from synchronized\nleak (in long-lasting sparks) by larger Peierls contour lengths, an output\nparameter reflecting degree of disorder. Thus, in addition to our detailed\nnumerical model approach we also offer an instantaneous computational tool\nusing analytical formulas of the Ising model for respective RyR parameters and\nSR Ca load that describe and classify phase transitions and leak emergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2018 20:47:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 May 2019 17:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Using\nthe Bayesian X-ray Astronomy (BXA) package, we constrain redshift, column\ndensity, photon index and luminosity simultaneously. The redshift information\nprimarily comes from absorption edges in Compton-thin AGN, and from the Fe\nK$\\alpha$ fluorescent line in heavily obscured AGN.

The existence of such a remote relationship need\nto be explained. The unity of the living system throughout the history of life\nrelies on the common features of life: the homochirality, the genetic code and\nthe universal genome format. The universal genome format has been observed in\nthe genomic codon distributions as a common feature of life at the sequence\nlevel. A main aim of this article is to reconstruct and to explain the\nPhanerozoic biodiversity curve. It has been observed that the exponential\ngrowth rate of the Phanerozoic biodiversity curve is about equal to the\nexponential growth rate of genome size evolution. Hence it is strongly\nindicated that the expansion of genomes causes the exponential trend of the\nPhanerozoic biodiversity curve, where the conservative property during the\nevolution of life is guaranteed by the universal genome format at the sequence\nlevel. In addition, a consensus curve based on the climatic and eustatic data\nis obtained to explain the fluctuations of the Phanerozoic biodiversity curve.\nThus, the reconstructed biodiversity curve based on genomic, climatic and\neustatic data agrees with Sepkoski's curve based on fossil data. The five mass\nextinctions can be discerned in this reconstructed biodiversity curve, which\nindicates a tectonic cause of the mass extinctions. And the declining\norigination rate and extinction rate throughout the Phanerozoic eon might be\ndue to the growth trend in genome size evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 02:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-06"}

The\nleading-order terms of this horizon flux introduce 2.5 and 3.5 post-Newtonian\ncorrections to inspiral motions of binary black holes. The corrections may be\nmeasurable by gravitational waves detectors. Since the proper improvements to\ngeneral relativity is still a mystery, it is possible that the true modified\ngravity theory introduces negligible direct corrections to the geodesics of\ntest masses, while near horizon corrections are observable. We introduce a\nparameterization to describe arbitrary mass and spin growth of inspiralling\nblack holes. Comparing signals of gravitational waves and a waveform model with\nparameterized horizon flux corrections, deviations from general relativity can\nbe constrained. We simulate a set of gravitational waves signals following an\nastrophysical distribution with horizon flux modifications. Then, we perform a\nBayesian analysis to obtain the expected constraints from the simulated\nresponse of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network to the simulated signals.\nWe show that the constraint can be improved by stacking multiple detections.\nThe constraints of modified horizon flux can be used to test a specific class\nof modified gravity theories which predict dominant corrections near black-hole\nhorizons over other types of corrections to general relativity. To support\nHawking's area theorem at 90\\% confidence level, over 10000 LIGO-Virgo\ndetections are required. Within the lifetime of LIGO and Einstein Telescope, a\nfuture ground-based gravitational wave detector, near horizon corrections of\nmodified gravity theories are potentially detectable if one of the modified\ngravity theory is true and the theory predicts a strong correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 04:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 03:10:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 02:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

While it is prevalent to outsource model\ntraining and serving tasks in the cloud, it is important to protect the privacy\nof sensitive samples in the training dataset and prevent information leakage to\nuntrusted third parties. Past work have shown that a malicious machine learning\nservice provider or end user can easily extract critical information about the\ntraining samples, from the model parameters or even just model outputs.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel and generic methodology to preserve the\nprivacy of training data in machine learning applications. Specifically we\nintroduce an obfuscate function and apply it to the training data before\nfeeding them to the model training task. This function adds random noise to\nexisting samples, or augments the dataset with new samples. By doing so\nsensitive information about the properties of individual samples, or\nstatistical properties of a group of samples, is hidden. Meanwhile the model\ntrained from the obfuscated dataset can still achieve high accuracy. With this\napproach, the customers can safely disclose the data or models to third-party\nproviders or end users without the need to worry about data privacy.

The results of the experiment show that the fast one-side heating of\nsuch a droplet may lead to either symmetric or asymmetric expansion followed by\ndifferent fragmentation scenarios. To unveil the underlying processes leading\nto fragmentation we perform simulation of liquid-tin droplet expansion produced\nby the initial conditions similar to those in experiment using the smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Simulation demonstrates that a thin heated\nsurface layer generates a ultrashort shock wave propagating from the frontal\nside to rear side of the droplet. Convergence of such shock wave followed by a\nrarefaction tale to the droplet center results in the cavitation of material\ninside the central region by the strong tensile stress. Reflection of the shock\nwave from the rear side of droplet produces another region of highly stretched\nmaterial where the spallation may occur producing a thin spallation layer\nmoving with a velocity higher than expansion of the central shell after\ncavitation. It is shown both experimentally and numerically that the threshold\nlaser intensity necessary for the spallation is higher than the threshold\nrequired to induce cavitation in the central region of droplet. Thus, the\nregime of asymmetrical expansion is realized if the laser intensity exceeds the\nspallation threshold.

In contrast to consumer, movie, and common surveillance\nvideos, satellite video can record the snapshot of the city-scale scene. In a\nbroad field-of-view of satellite videos, each moving target would be very tiny\nand usually composed of several pixels in frames. Even worse, the noise signals\nalso existed in the video frames, since the background of the video frame has\nthe subpixel-level and uneven moving thanks to the motion of satellites.

Since the search range is\nobtained from the previous iteration, errors may occur when the propagated\nsearch range is not sufficient.

Furthermore, a novel disparity\nglobal refinement approach developed from the Markov Random Fields and Fast\nBilateral Stereo is introduced to further improve the accuracy of the estimated\ndisparity map, where disparities are updated iteratively by minimising the\nenergy function that is related to their interpolated correlation polynomials.\nThe algorithm is implemented in C language with a near real-time performance.\nThe experimental results illustrate that the absolute error of the\nreconstruction varies from 0.1 mm to 3 mm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 07:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 03:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope\n(STM) is used to create local ionic states in one fragment of the dyad. The CT\nprocess is monitored by imaging subsequent changes in the neighbor acceptor\nmolecule and its efficiency is mapped revealing the influence of the initial\nexcited state in the donor molecule. In validation of the experiments,\nsimulations based on density functional theory show that holes have a higher\ndonor-acceptor CT rate compared to electrons and highlight a noticeable initial\nstate dependence on the CT process. We leverage the unprecedented spatial\nresolution achieved in our experiments to show that the CT process in the dyad\nis governed via molecule-molecule coherent tunneling with negligible\nsurface-mediated character.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 07:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-06"}

The coevolution\nmethods were performing well, but results were not stable from one game to\nanother. In spite of its simplicity, the seed method, which can be seen as an\nextremal version of coevolution, works even when nothing else works.\nIncidentally, these methods brought out some unexpected strategies for some\ngames, such as Batawaf or the game of War, which seem, at first view, purely\nrandom games without any structured actions possible for the players or Guess\nWho, where a dichotomy between the characters seems to be the most reasonable\nstrategy.

The\nproposed scale-adaptive anchors allow us to use a few number of anchors to\nhandle multi-scale texts and therefore significantly improve the computational\nefficiency. Moreover, compared to discrete scales used in previous methods, the\nlearned continuous scales are more reliable, especially for small texts\ndetection. Additionally, we propose Anchor convolution to better exploit\nnecessary feature information by dynamically adjusting the sizes of receptive\nfields according to the learned scales.

The results are obtained from an\nanalysis of $pp$ collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n$3.0~\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$. The data were collected with the LHCb detector at\ncentre-of-mass energies of $7$ and $8$ TeV. The branching fraction of the $B^0\n\\to \\overline{D}^0 K^+ K^-$ decay is measured relative to that of the decay\n$B^0 \\to \\overline{D}^0 \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ to be $$\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(B^0 \\to\n\\overline{D}^0 K^+ K^-)}{\\mathcal{B}(B^0 \\to \\overline{D}^0 \\pi^+ \\pi^-)} =\n(6.9 \\pm 0.4 \\pm 0.3)\\%,$$ where the first uncertainty is statistical and the\nsecond is systematic. The measured branching fraction of the $B_s^0 \\to\n\\overline{D}^0 K^+ K^-$ decay mode relative to that of the corresponding $B^0$\ndecay is $$\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(B_s^0 \\to \\overline{D}^0 K^+ K^-)}{\\mathcal{B}(B^0\n\\to \\overline{D}^0 K^+ K^-)} = (93.0 \\pm 8.9 \\pm 6.9)\\%.$$ Using the known\nbranching fraction of ${B^0 \\to \\overline{D}^0 \\pi^+ \\pi^-}$, the values of\n${{\\mathcal B}(B^0 \\to \\overline{D}^0 K^+ K^- )=(6.1 \\pm 0.4 \\pm 0.3 \\pm 0.3)\n\\times 10^{-5}}$, and ${{\\cal B}(B_s^0 \\to \\overline{D}^0 K^+ K^-)=}$ $(5.7 \\pm\n0.5 \\pm 0.4 \\pm 0.5) \\times 10^{-5}$ are obtained, where the third\nuncertainties arise from the branching fraction of the decay modes ${B^0 \\to\n\\overline{D}^0 \\pi^+ \\pi^-}$ and $B^0 \\to \\overline{D}^0 K^+ K^-$,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 08:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 09:04:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 07:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

However, there is some controversy about the spectral type\nof R Mon. Some authors propose that it could be a later B8e star, where disks\nare more common. We have re-evaluated the spectral type of R Mon using the\navailable continuum data and UVES emission lines. We used a power-law disk\nmodel to fit previous 12 CO 1-0 and 2-1 interferometric observations and the\nPACS CO data to investigate the disk structure. Interferometric detections of\n13 CO J=1-0, HCO+ 1-0, and CN 1-0 lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer (PdBI) are presented. The HCN 1-0 line was not detected. Our\nanalysis confirms that R Mon is a B0 star. The disk model compatible with the\n12 CO 1-0 and 2-1 interferometric observations falls short of predicting the\nobserved fluxes of the 14<Ju<31 PACS lines; this is consistent with the\nscenario in which some contribution to these lines is coming from a warm\nenvelope and/or UV-illuminated outflow walls. More interestingly, the upper\nlimits to the fluxes of the Ju>31 CO lines suggest the existence of a region\nempty of CO at R<20 au in the proto-planetary disk. The intense emission of the\nHCO+ and CN lines shows the strong influence of UV photons on gas chemistry.\nThe observations gathered in this paper are consistent with the presence around\nR Mon of a transition disk with a cavity about 20 au.

Such a curve traces the path of a fluid particle whose instantaneous\nvelocity equals the elevation of the wave at that point (or the square of the\nelevation, in the Novikov case). The peakons themselves follow characteristic\ncurves, and the remaining characteristic curves can be viewed as paths of\n'ghostpeakons' with zero amplitude; hence, they can be obtained as solutions of\nthe ODEs governing the dynamics of multipeakon solutions. The previously known\nsolution formulas for multipeakons only cover the case when all amplitudes are\nnonzero, since they are based upon inverse spectral methods unable to detect\nthe ghostpeakons. We show how to overcome this problem by taking a suitable\nlimit in terms of spectral data, in order to force a selected peakon amplitude\nto become zero. Moreover, we use direct integration to compute the\ncharacteristic curves for the solution of the Degasperis-Procesi equation where\na shockpeakon forms at a peakon-antipeakon collision. In addition to the\ntheoretical interest in knowing the characteristic curves, they are also useful\nfor plotting multipeakon solutions, as we illustrate in several examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 09:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 04:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

A management unit (MU) is allowed to manipulate the\noriginal data sequence in an online fashion, while satisfying an average\ndistortion constraint. The goal of the MU is to maximize the minimal type II\nprobability of error subject to a constraint on the type I probability of error\nassuming an adversarial Neyman-Pearson test, or to maximize the minimal error\nprobability assuming an adversarial Bayesian test. The asymptotic exponents of\nthe maximum minimal type II probability of error and the maximum minimal error\nprobability are shown to be characterized by a Kullback-Leibler divergence rate\nand a Chernoff information rate, respectively. Privacy performances of\nparticular management policies, the memoryless hypothesis-aware policy and the\nhypothesis-unaware policy with memory, are compared. The proposed formulation\ncan also model adversarial example generation with minimal data manipulation to\nfool classifiers.

While kinematic\noptimization allows for efficient representation and online generation of\nhitting trajectories, learning to track such dynamic movements with inaccurate\nmodels remains an open problem. In particular, stability issues surrounding the\nlearning performance, in the iteration domain, can prevent the successful\nimplementation of model based learning approaches. To achieve accurate tracking\nfor such tasks in a stable and efficient way, we propose a new adaptive\nIterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm that is implemented efficiently\nusing a recursive approach. Moreover, covariance estimates of model matrices\nare used to exercise caution during learning. We evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed approach in extensive simulations and in our robotic table tennis\nplatform, where we show how the striking performance of two seven degree of\nfreedom anthropomorphic robot arms can be optimized.

However, we note that this model cannot be statistically\ndistinguished from a non-lamppost model with free emissivity index, for which\nthe inclination is markedly higher. Additionally, we find a relatively cool\ncorona ($57-70$ keV), and large iron abundance ($3.3-3.7$ solar). We further\nfind that properly accounting for Comptonization of the reflection emission\nimproves the fit significantly and causes an otherwise low reflection fraction\n($\\sim 0.2-0.3$) to increase by an order of magnitude, in line with geometrical\nexpectations for a lamppost corona. We compare these results with similar\ninvestigations reported for GX 339-4 in its bright hard state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 11:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

The main contribution of the\nreinterpretation is in providing a theoretical framework useful for analysing\nand extending the algorithm. We show that the proposed framework suffers from\nseveral issues; from undefined or pathological behaviour of the true posterior\nrelated to use of improper priors, to an ill-defined variational objective due\nto singularity of the approximating distribution relative to the true\nposterior. Our analysis of the improper log uniform prior used in variational\nGaussian dropout suggests the pathologies are generally irredeemable, and that\nthe algorithm still works only because the variational formulation annuls some\nof the pathologies. To address the singularity issue, we proffer Quasi-KL (QKL)\ndivergence, a new approximate inference objective for approximation of\nhigh-dimensional distributions.

Methods: We performed\nspectrographic observations of V902 Mon in 2016 with the 2.2m Calar Alto\ntelescope, and X-ray photometry and spectroscopy with XMM-Newton in October\n2017. This data was supplemented by several years of AAVSO visual photometry.\nResults: We have confirmed V902 Mon as an IP based on detecting the spin\nperiod, with a value of 2,208s, at multiple epochs. Spectroscopy of the donor\nstar and Gaia parallax yield a distance of 3.5+1.3-0.9, kpc, suggesting an\nX-ray luminosity one or two orders of magnitude lower than the 10^33 erg/s\ntypical of previously known IPs. The X-ray to optical flux ratio is also very\nlow. The inclination of the system is more than 79deg, with a most likely value\nof around 82deg. We have refined the eclipse ephemeris, stable over 14,000\ncycles. The Halpha line is present throughout the orbital cycle and is clearly\npresent during eclipse, suggesting an origin distant from the white dwarf, and\nshows radial velocity variations at the orbital period. The amplitude and\noverall recessional velocity seem inconsistent with an origin in the disc. The\n\\emph{XMM-Newton} observation reveals a partially absorbed plasma model typical\nof magnetic CVs, with a fluorescent iron line at 6.4keV showing a large\nequivalent width of 1.4keV. Conclusions: V902 Mon is an IP, and probably a\nmember of the hypothesized X-ray underluminous class of IPs. It is likely to be\na disc accretor, though the radial velocity behaviour of the Halpha line\nremains puzzling. The large equivalent width of the fluorescent iron line, the\nsmall FX/Fopt ratio, and the only marginal detection of X-ray eclipses suggests\nthat the X-ray emission arises from scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 13:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

However, it recently became\nclear that many lattice systems can exist also in synthetic dimensions which\nare not spatial but extend over a different degree of freedom. Thus far,\ntopological insulators in synthetic dimensions were demonstrated only in cold\natoms, where synthetic dimensions have now become a useful tool for\ndemonstrating a variety of lattice models that are not available in spatial\nlattices. Subsequently, efforts have been directed towards realizing\ntopological lattices with synthetic dimensions in photonics, where they are\nconnected to physical phenomena in high-dimensions, interacting photons, and\nmore. Here we demonstrate experimentally the first photonic topological\ninsulator in synthetic dimensions. The ability to study experimentally photonic\nsystems in synthetic dimensions opens the door for a plethora of unexplored\nphysical phenomena ranging from PT-symmetry, exceptional points and\nunidirectional invisibility to Anderson localization in high dimensions and\nhigh-dimensional lattice solitons, topological insulator lasers in synthetic\ndimensions and more. Our study here paves the way to these exciting phenomena,\nwhich are extremely hard (if not impossible) to observe in other physical\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 13:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

A key aspect of general relativity to test is the strong equivalence\nprinciple (SEP), which states that all freely falling objects, regardless of\nhow strong their gravity, experience the same acceleration in the same\ngravitational field. Essentially all alternatives to general relativity violate\nthis principle at some level. Previous direct tests of the SEP are limited by\nthe weak gravity of the bodies in the Earth-Moon-Sun system or by the weak\ngravitational pull of the Galaxy on pulsar-white dwarf binaries. PSR~J0337+1715\nis a hierarchical stellar triple system, where the inner binary consists of a\nmillisecond radio pulsar in a $1.6$-day orbit with a white dwarf. This inner\nbinary is in a $327$-day orbit with another white dwarf. In this system, the\npulsar and the inner companion fall toward the outer companion with an\nacceleration about $10^8$ times greater than that produced by falling in the\nGalactic potential, and the pulsar's gravitational binding energy is roughly\n$10\\%$ of its mass. Here we report that in spite of the pulsar's strong\ngravity, the accelerations experienced by it and the inner white dwarf differ\nby a fraction of no more than $2.6\\times 10^{-6}$ ($95\\%$ confidence level).

We are completing the previously reported\nradiative datasets with new photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections\nfor isoelectronic sequences with electron number $19\\leq N\\leq 26$. We are also\ngiving attention to the access, integrity and usability of the whole resulting\natomic database. Target representations are obtained with the atomic structure\ncode AUTOSTRUCTURE. Where possible, cross sections for ground-configuration\nstates are computed with the Breit--Pauli $R$-matrix method (BPRM) in either\nintermediate or $LS$ coupling including damping (radiative and Auger) effects;\notherwise and more generally, they are generated in the isolated-resonance\napproximation with AUTOSTRUCTURE. Cross sections were computed with BPRM only\nfor the K ($N=19$) and Ca ($N=20$) isoelectronic sequences, the latter in $LS$\ncoupling. For the rest of the sequences ($21\\leq N \\leq 26$), AUTOSTRUCTURE was\nrun in $LS$-coupling mode taking into account damping effects. Comparisons\nbetween these two methods for K-like Zn XII and Ca-like Zn XI show that, to\nensure reasonable accuracy, the $LS$ calculations must be performed taking into\naccount the non-fine-structure relativistic corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 15:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

Existing\nresearch studies have focused on social media to track and analyse real world\nevents like emerging trends, natural disasters, user sentiment analysis,\npolitical opinions, and health care. However there is less attention given on\nsocial welfare issues like DV and its impact on public health. Recently, the\nvictims of DV turned to social media platforms to express their feelings in the\nform of posts and seek the social and emotional support, for sympathetic\nencouragement, to show compassion and empathy among public. But, it is\ndifficult to mine the actionable knowledge from large conversational datasets\nfrom social media due to the characteristics of high dimensions, short, noisy,\nhuge volume, high velocity, and so on. Hence, this paper will propose a novel\nframework to model and discover the various themes related to DV from the\npublic domain.

After the\nmodel is trained, each real frame has a corresponding representation point on\nmanifold in the latent space, and each representation point has corresponding\nreconstructed image. For the navigation problem, we map the starting image and\ndestination image to the latent space, then optimize a path on the learned\nmanifold connecting the two points, and finally map the path back through\ndecoder to a sequence of images. The ideal sequence of images should correspond\nto a route that is spatially continuous - i.e. neighbor images in the route\nshould correspond to neighbor locations in physical space. Such a route could\nbe used for navigation with computer vision techniques, i.e. a robot could\nfollow the image sequence from starting location to destination in the\nenvironment step by step. We implement this algorithm, but find in our\nexperimental results that the resulting route is not satisfactory. The route\nconsist of several discontinuous image frames along the ideal routes, so that\nthe route could not be followed by a robot with computer vision techniques in\npractice. In our evaluation, we propose two reasons for our failure to\nautomatically find continuous routes: (1) The VAE tends to capture global\nstructures, but discard the details; (2) the Euclidean similarity metric used\nfor measuring continuity between house images is sub-optimal. For further work,\nwe propose: trying other generative models like VAE-GANs which may be better at\nreconstructing the details to learn the representation map, and adjusting the\nsimilarity metric in the path selecting algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 14:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

The optimized\nvalues of thermal conductivities of electrons and Seebeck coefficients act as\ndriving force to modulate thermoelectric effects. Figure of merit is calculated\nto be 0.074 at 300 K and 0.152 at 500 K of the MLBP system as a function of the\npower factor. The value of lattice thermal conductivity is 37.15 W/mK at room\ntemperature and follows the inverse dependency with temperature. With the\nanticipated superior performance, profound thermoelectric applications can be\nachieved particularly in the monolayer black phosphorous system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 11:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 05:57:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 18:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 11:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

The mobility-on-demand systems have been proposed as an\nalternative to a private car. Such systems consist of a fleet of vehicles that\nthe user of the system can hail for one-way point-to-point trips. These systems\nemploy large-scale vehicle sharing, i.e., one vehicle can be used by several\npeople during one day and consequently the fleet size and the parking space\nrequirements can be reduced, but, at the cost of a non-negligible increase in\nvehicles miles driven in the system. The miles driven in the system can be\nreduced by ridesharing, where several people traveling in a similar direction\nare matched and travel in one vehicle. We quantify the potential of ridesharing\nin a hypothetical mobility-on-demand system designed to serve all trips that\nare currently realized by private car in the city of Prague. Our results show\nthat by employing a ridesharing strategy that guarantees travel time\nprolongation of no more than 10 minutes, the average occupancy of a vehicle\nwill increase to 2.7 passengers. Consequently, the number of vehicle miles\ntraveled will decrease to 35% of the amount in the MoD system without\nridesharing and to 60% of the amount in the present state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 15:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

NMF codes naturally favor\nsparse, parts-based representations. In sparse representation, signals\nrepresented as a linear combination of a redundant dictionary atoms. In this\npaper, we propose an algorithm based on sparse representation over the\nredundant dictionary and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (N-NMF).

It has been proven that, at high-energy conditions, the\nfermion field described by Dirac Lagrangian interacts with the half-integer\nspin tachyon field with negative energy, causing the formation of composite\nparticles whose mass depends on the total angular momentum. The proposed theory\nis based on a new interpretation of the Majorana equation for particles with\narbitrary spin and shows that mass oscillation is a phenomenon in which the\ncomponent of particle decay prevails over that of mixing mass states. Using the\nkinematic of Lemke for spacelike particle decay, we propose a mechanism able to\nexplain the neutrino flavour change.
