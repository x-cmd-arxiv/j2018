Here,\nthe electrostatic-elastic case is considered, where an elastic membrane is\nallowed to deflect above a ground plate under the action of an electric\npotential, whose strength is proportional to a parameter $\\lambda$. Such\ndevices are commonly described by a parabolic partial differential equation\nthat contains a singular nonlinear source term. The singularity in that term\ncorresponds to the so-called \"touchdown\" phenomenon, where the membrane\nestablishes contact with the ground plate. Touchdown is known to imply the\nnon-existence of steady state solutions and blow-up of solutions in finite\ntime. We study a recently proposed extension of that canonical model, where\nsuch singularities are avoided due to the introduction of a regularizing term\ninvolving a small \"regularization\" parameter $\\varepsilon$. Methods from\ndynamical systems and geometric singular perturbation theory, in particular the\ndesingularization technique known as \"blow-up\", allow for a precise description\nof steady-state solutions of the regularized model, as well as for a detailed\nresolution of the resulting bifurcation diagram. The interplay between the two\nmain model parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $\\lambda$ is emphasized; in particular,\nthe focus is on the singular limit as both parameters tend to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 16:03:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 13:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

I describe three insights into the transition\nfrom quantum to classical that are based on the recognition of the role of the\nenvironment. I begin with derivation of preferred sets of states that help\ndefine what exists - our everyday classical reality. They emerge as a result of\nbreaking of the unitary symmetry of the Hilbert space which happens when the\nunitarity of quantum evolutions encounters nonlinearities inherent in the\nprocess of amplification - of replicating information. This derivation is\naccomplished without the usual tools of decoherence, and accounts for the\nappearance of quantum jumps and emergence of preferred pointer states\nconsistent with those obtained via environment-induced superselection, or\neinselection. Pointer states obtained this way determine what can happen -\ndefine events - without appealing to Born's rule for probabilities. Therefore,\nBorn's rule can be now deduced from the entanglement-assisted invariance, or\nenvariance - a symmetry of entangled quantum states. With probabilities at hand\none also gains new insights into foundations of quantum statistical physics.\nMoreover, one can now analyze information flows responsible for decoherence.\nThese information flows explain how perception of objective classical reality\narises from the quantum substrate: Effective amplification they represent\naccounts for the objective existence of the einselected states of macroscopic\nquantum systems through the redundancy of pointer state records in their\nenvironment - through quantum Darwinism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 17:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

This was the first time that such structures were\nfound around a small body. In 2015, it was proposed that the Centaur (2060)\nChiron may also have a ring. In a previous study, we analyzed how close\nencounters with giant planets would affect the rings of Chariklo. The most\nlikely result is the survival of the rings. In the present work, we broaden our\nanalysis to (2060) Chiron. In addition to Chariklo, Chiron is currently the\nonly known Centaur with a presumed ring. By applying the same method as\n\\cite{araujo2016}, we performed numerical integrations of a system composed of\n729 clones of Chiron, the Sun, and the giant planets. The number of close\nencounters that disrupted the ring of Chiron during one half-life of the study\nperiod was computed. This number was then compared to the number of close\nencounters for Chariklo. We found that the probability of Chiron losing its\nring due to close encounters with the giant planets is about six times higher\nthan that for Chariklo. Our analysis showed that, unlike Chariklo, Chiron is\nmore likely to remain in an orbit with a relatively low inclination and high\neccentricity. Thus, we found that the bodies in Chiron-like orbits are less\nlikely to retain rings than those in Chariklo-like orbits. Overall, for\nobservational purposes, we conclude that the bigger bodies in orbits with high\ninclinations and low eccentricities should be prioritized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 17:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Tests show two limiting\nbehaviors with increasing particle inertia, similar to the results from the\nlinear stability analysis of saffman, 1962: low-inertia particles trigger the\nlaminar-to-turbulent instability whereas high-inertia particles tend to\nstabilize turbulence due to the extra dissipation induced by particle-fluid\ncoupling. Furthermore, it is found that the streamwise coupling between phases\nis the dominant factor in damping the turbulence and is highly related to the\nspatial distribution of the particles. The presence of particles in different\nturbulent coherent structures (large scale vortices or large scale streaks)\ndetermines the turbulent kinetic energy of particulate phase, which is related\nto the particle response time scaled by the turnover time of large scale\nvortices. By quantitatively investigating the periodic character of the whole\nregeneration cycle and the phase difference between linked sub-steps, we show\nthat the presence of inertial particles does not alter the periodic nature of\nthe cycle or the relative length of each of the sub-steps. Instead,\nhigh-inertia particles greatly weaken the large-scale vortices as well as the\nstreamwise vorticity stretching and lift-up effects, thereby suppressing the\nfluctuating amplitude of the large scale streaks. The primary influence of\nlow-inertia particles, however, is to strengthen the large scale vortices,\nwhich fosters the cycle and ultimately reduces the critical Reynolds number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 17:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

One prediction of this\nquasi-periodic, galactic-scale \"breathing\" is an $anti$-correlation between\nstar formation rate (SFR) and half-light radius as central gas overdensities\nlead to starbursts whose feedback drags stars to larger radii while star\nformation dwindles. We test this prediction with a sample of 322 $isolated$\nIMGs with stellar masses of $10^{9.0} \\leq M/M_{\\odot} \\leq 10^{9.5}$ at\n$0.3<z<0.4$ in the HST $I_{814}$ COSMOS footprint. We find that IMGs with\nhigher specific SFRs (SSFR $>10^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$) are the most extended with\nmedian sizes of $R_e \\sim 3-3.4$ kpc and are mostly disk-dominated systems. In\ncontrast, IMGs with lower SSFRs ($<10^{-10}$ yr$^{-1}$) are a factor of $\\sim\n2-3$ more compact with median sizes of $R_e \\sim 0.9-1.6$ kpc and have more\nsignificant bulge contributions to their light. These observed trends are\nopposite the predictions for stellar feedback that operate via the \"breathing\"\nprocess described above. We discuss various paths to reconcile the observations\nand simulations, all of which likely require a different implementation of\nstellar feedback in IMGs that drastically changes their predicted formation\nhistory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

The networks are trained on\nsimulations of the forward observing process, and take combinations of moments\nof the galaxy images as inputs. A challenging peculiarity of this ML\napplication is the combination of the noisiness of the input features and the\nrequirements on the accuracy of the inverse regression.

All these corrections can\npotentially be probed by measuring the stochastic gravitational- wave\nbackground. However, most existing treatments of this background beyond GR\noverlook modifications to the energy carried by gravitational waves, or rely on\nGR assumptions that are invalid in other theories. This may lead to\nmistranslation between the observable cross-correlation of detector outputs and\ngravitational-wave energy density, and thus to errors when deriving\nobservational constraints on theories. In this article, we lay out a generic\nformalism for stochastic gravitational- wave searches, applicable to a large\nfamily of theories beyond GR. We explicitly state the (often tacit) assumptions\nthat go into these searches, evaluating their generic applicability, or lack\nthereof.

Axions are one particularly\nwell-motivated class of extensions to the Standard Model leading to new forces\nand sources of radiation, which we focus on in this paper. Using an effective\nfield theory (EFT) approach, we calculate the first post-Newtonian corrections\nto the orbital dynamics, radiated power, and gravitational waveform for binary\nneutron star mergers in the presence of an axion. This result is applicable to\nmany theories which add an extra massive scalar degree of freedom to General\nRelativity. We then perform a detailed forecast of the potential for Advanced\nLIGO to constrain the free parameters of the EFT, and map these to the mass\n$m_a$ and decay constant $f_a$ of the axion. At design sensitivity, we find\nthat Advanced LIGO can potentially exclude axions with $m_a \\lesssim 10^{-11} \\\n{\\rm eV}$ and $f_a \\sim (10^{14} - 10^{17}) \\ {\\rm GeV}$.

With the derived bound, in a second part\nwe analyze the optimal number of UAV-tiers, and propose a low-complexity\nprocedure that significantly reduces the search-size and yields near-optimal\nperformance. Moreover, asymptotic properties both for the ergodic capacity of\nRayleigh product channel, and the optimal solutions on number of tiers are\nextensively analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 18:54:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 05:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Methods: DCE-MR images of 460\nsubjects with breast cancer acquired by different scanners were used in this\nstudy. Each subject had one T1-weighted pre-contrast image and three\nT1-weighted post-contrast images available. Our normalization algorithm\noperated under the assumption that the same type of tissue in different\npatients should be represented by the same voxel value. We used four\ntissue/material types as the anchors for the normalization: 1) air, 2) fat\ntissue, 3) dense tissue, and 4) heart. The algorithm proceeded in the following\ntwo steps: First, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm was applied\nto perform tissue segmentation accurately and efficiently. Then, based on the\nsegmentation results, a subject-specific piecewise linear mapping function was\napplied between the anchor points to normalize the same type of tissue in\ndifferent patients into the same intensity ranges. We evaluated the algorithm\nwith 300 subjects used for training and the rest used for testing. Results: The\napplication of our algorithm to images with different scanning parameters\nresulted in highly improved consistency in pixel values and extracted radiomics\nfeatures. Conclusion: The proposed image normalization strategy based on tissue\nsegmentation can perform intensity correction fully automatically, without the\nknowledge of the scanner parameters. Significance: We have thoroughly tested\nour algorithm and showed that it successfully normalizes the intensity of\nDCE-MR images. We made our software publicly available for others to apply in\ntheir analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 18:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-09"}

Trust-region schemes have also been applied to problems\nwhere the objective value is subject to noise: this setting is of particular\ninterest in fields such as data assimilation, where efficient methods that can\nadapt to noise are needed to account for the intrinsic uncertainty in the input\ndata.\n  In this paper, we describe a stochastic Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that\nhandles noisy objective function values and random models, provided sufficient\naccuracy is achieved in probability.

We perform an assessment of the impact of various two-dimensional\nsurface non-uniformities, such as backward or forward steps, combinations of\nbackward and forward steps, wavy surfaces, surface dips, and surface humps.\nDisturbances inside a Mach 5.92 flat-plate boundary layer are excited using\nperiodic wall blowing and suction at an upstream location.

The work is still in early stages, and further investigation is\nrequired before intent-based systems will be adopted by enterprise networks. To\nhelp achieve the goal of moving to an intent-based design, we propose an\nSDN-based network programming framework, the Open Software Defined Framework\n(OSDF). OSDF provides a high level Application Programming Interface (API) that\ncan be used by managers and network administrators to express network\nrequirements for applications and policies for multiple domains. OSDF also\nprovides a set of high level network operation services that handle common\nnetwork configuration, monitoring, and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning.\nOSDF is equipped with a policy conflict management module to help a network\nadministrator detect and resolve policy conflicts. The paper shows how OSDF can\nbe used and explains application-based policies. Finally, the paper reports the\nresults of both testbed measurements and simulations that are used to evaluate\nthe framework from multiple perspectives, including functionality and\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 00:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-09"}

Modern approaches, often relying on ADP, simulation, and/or\nduality, have limited rigorous guarantees, which may scale poorly and/or\nrequire previous knowledge of basis functions. A key difficulty with many\napproaches is that to yield stronger guarantees, they would necessitate the\ncomputation of deeply nested conditional expectations, with the depth scaling\nwith the time horizon T.\n  We overcome this fundamental obstacle by providing an algorithm which can\ntrade-off between the guaranteed quality of approximation and the level of\nnesting required in a principled manner, without requiring a set of good basis\nfunctions. We develop a novel pure-dual approach, inspired by a connection to\nnetwork flows. This leads to a representation for the optimal value as an\ninfinite sum for which: 1. each term is the expectation of an elegant\nrecursively defined infimum; 2. the first k terms only require k levels of\nnesting; and 3. truncating at the first k terms yields an error of 1/k. This\nenables us to devise a simple randomized algorithm whose runtime is effectively\nindependent of the dimension, beyond the need to simulate sample paths of the\nunderlying process. Indeed, our algorithm is completely data-driven in that it\nonly needs the ability to simulate the original process, and requires no prior\nknowledge of the underlying distribution. Our method allows one to elegantly\ntrade-off between accuracy and runtime through a parameter epsilon controlling\nthe associated performance guarantee, with computational and sample complexity\nboth polynomial in T (and effectively independent of the dimension) for any\nfixed epsilon, in contrast to past methods typically requiring a complexity\nscaling exponentially in these parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 02:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 18:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

The question is whether the electric\nfield can produce spatially localized propagating solitons of molecular\norientation. Here we demonstrate electrically driven three-dimensional\nparticle-like solitons representing self-trapped waves of oscillating molecular\norientation. The solitons propagate with a very high speed perpendicularly to\nboth the electric field and the initial alignment direction. The propulsion is\nenabled by rapid collective reorientations of the molecules with the frequency\nof the applied electric field and by lack of fore-aft symmetry. The solitons\npreserve spatially-confined shapes while moving over distances hundreds of\ntimes larger than their size and survive collisions. During collisions, the\nsolitons show repulsions and attractions, depending on the impact parameter.\nThe solitons are topologically equivalent to the uniform state and have no\nstatic analogs, thus exhibiting a particle-wave duality.

With\npreceding pixels as the context, traditional intra prediction schemes generate\nlinear predictions based on several predefined directions (i.e. modes) for\nblocks to be encoded. However, these modes are relatively simple and their\npredictions may fail when facing blocks with complex textures, which leads to\nadditional bits encoding the residue. In this paper, we design a Progressive\nSpatial Recurrent Neural Network (PS-RNN) that learns to conduct intra\nprediction. Specifically, our PS-RNN consists of three spatial recurrent units\nand progressively generates predictions by passing information along from\npreceding contents to blocks to be encoded. To make our network generate\npredictions considering both distortion and bit-rate, we propose to use Sum of\nAbsolute Transformed Difference (SATD) as the loss function to train PS-RNN\nsince SATD is able to measure rate-distortion cost of encoding a residue block.\nMoreover, our method supports variable-block-size for intra prediction, which\nis more practical in real coding conditions.

Instead, they are split, replicated (to ensure\nreliability in case of server malfunction) and stored in different servers. We\nanalyze the mean latency of such a split-and-replicate cloud storage system\nunder general sub-exponential service time. We present a novel scheduling\nscheme that utilizes the load-balancing policy of the \\textit{power of $d$\n$(\\geq 2)$} choices. An alternative to split-and-replicate is to use\nerasure-codes, and recently, it has been observed that they can reduce latency\nin data access (see \\cite{longbo_delay} for details). We argue that under high\nredundancy (integer redundancy factor strictly greater than or equal to 2)\nregime, the mean latency of a coded system is upper bounded by that of a\nsplit-and-replicate system (with same replication factor) and the gap between\nthese two is small. We validate this claim numerically under different service\ndistributions such as exponential, shift plus exponential and the heavy-tailed\nWeibull distribution and compare the mean latency to that of an\nunsplit-replicated system. We observe that the coded system outperforms the\nunsplit-replication system by at least $20\\%$. Furthermore, we consider the\nmean latency for an erasure coded system with low redundancy (fractional\nredundancy factor between 1 and 2), a scenario which is more pragmatic, given\nthe storage constraints (\\cite{rashmi_thesis}). However under this regime, we\nrestrict ourselves to the special case of exponential service time distribution\nand use the randomized load balancing policy namely \\textit{batch-sampling}. We\nobtain an upper bound on mean delay that depends on the order statistics of the\nqueue lengths, which, we further smooth out via a discrete to continuous\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 04:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-09"}

First, we conduct an exploratory study that\nmotivates crowdsourced knowledge from Stack Overflow discussions as a potential\nresource for source code comment recommendation. Second, based on the findings\nfrom the exploratory study, we propose a heuristic-based technique for mining\ninsightful comments from Stack Overflow Q & A site for source code comment\nrecommendation. Experiments with 292 Stack Overflow code segments and 5,039\ndiscussion comments show that our approach has a promising recall of 85.42%.

However, the interactions\ncan be subject to various errors when the software's assumption on its\nenvironment no longer holds, thus leading to unexpected misbehavior or even\nfailure. To address this problem, one promising way is to conduct runtime\nmonitoring of invariants, so as to prevent cyber-physical software from\nentering such errors (a.k.a. abnormal states). To effectively detect abnormal\nstates, we in this article present an approach, named Context-based\nMulti-Invariant Detection (CoMID), which consists of two techniques:\ncontext-based trace grouping and multi-invariant detection. The former infers\ncontexts to distinguish different effective scopes for CoMID's derived\ninvariants, and the latter conducts ensemble evaluation of multiple invariants\nto detect abnormal states. We experimentally evaluate CoMID on real-world\ncyber-physical software.

We adopt a novel approach to resolve the two-stage formation of GCs\nin hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies.In the new simulations, new gas\nparticles that are much less massive than their parent star particle are\ngenerated around each new star particle when the new star enters into the\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Furthermore, much finer maximum time step\nwidth (<10^5 yr) and smaller softening length (<2 pc) are adopted for such AGB\ngas particles to properly resolve the ejection of gas from AGB stars and AGB\nfeedback effects. Therefore, secondary star formation from AGB ejecta can be\nproperly investigated in galaxy-scale simulations. An FG stellar system can\nfirst form from a massive gas clump developing due to gravitational instability\nwithin its host gas-rich dwarf galaxy. Initially the FG stellar system is not a\nsingle massive cluster, but instead is composed of several irregular stellar\nclumps (or filaments) with a total mass larger than 10^6 Msun. While the FG\nsystem is dynamically relaxing, gaseous ejecta from AGB stars can be\ngravitationally trapped by the FG system and subsequently converted into new\nstars to form a compact SG stellar system within the FG system. Interestingly,\nabout 40% of AGB ejecta is from stars that do not belong to the FG system\n(`external gas accretion').

The diagonalization of the system is\nequivalent to apply a spatial discrete Fourier transform. This leads to\nstability conditions expressed by the discrete Fourier transform of the first\nand second derivatives of the kernel. Although spurious modes are highlighted,\nno tensile nor pairing instabilities are found in the present study, suggesting\nthat the perturbations of the stresses are always damped if the base flow is\nincompressible. The perturbations equation is solved in the Laplace domain,\nallowing to derive an analytical solution of the transient state.

In this work, different fusion architectures are compared and\nevaluated by means of object detection tasks, in which the goal is to recognize\nand localize predefined objects in a stream of data. Usually, state-of-the-art\nobject detectors based on neural networks are highly optimized for good weather\nconditions, since the well-known benchmarks only consist of sensor data\nrecorded in optimal weather conditions.

Since reflexive rings and\nreduced rings are left N-reflexive, we investigate the sufficient conditions\nfor left N-reflexive rings to be reflexive and reduced. We first consider basic\nextensions of left N-reflexive rings. For an ideal-symmetric ideal $I$ of a\nring $R$, $R/I$ is left N-reflexive. If an ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ is reduced\nas a ring without identity and $R/I$ is left N-reflexive, then $R$ is left\nN-reflexive. If $R$ is a quasi-Armendariz ring and the coefficients of any\nnilpotent polynomial in $R[x]$ are nilpotent in $R$, it is proved that $R$ is\nleft N-reflexive if and only if $R[x]$ is left N-reflexive.

We performed a power-law\nfit for the relation between each pair of observables and determine the\npower-law index (or exponent) for these.\n  While the correlation between emission and magnetic field drops monotonically\nwith temperature, the power-law index shows a hockey-stick-type variation: from\nthe upper photosphere to the temperature-minimum it drops sharply and then\nincreases through the chromosphere into the transition region. This is even\nseen through the features of the MgII line, this is, from k1 to k2 and k3. It\nis irrespective of spatial resolution or feature types on the Sun.\n  In accordance with the general picture of flux-flux relations from the\nchromosphere to the corona, above the temperature minimum the sensitivity of\nthe emission to the plasma heating increases with temperature. Below the\ntemperature minimum a different mechanism has to govern the opposite trend of\nthe power-law index with temperature. We suggest four possibilities, in other\nwords, a geometric effect of expanding flux tubes filling the available\nchromospheric volume, the height of formation of the emitted radiation, the\ndependence on wavelength of the intensity-temperature relationship, and the\ndependence of the heating of flux tubes on the magnetic flux density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 12:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

This leads to defining weakly-communicating or\nmulti-chain MDPs. In this paper, we introduce \\tucrl, the first algorithm able\nto perform efficient exploration-exploitation in any finite Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) without requiring any form of prior knowledge. In particular, for\nany MDP with $S^{\\texttt{C}}$ communicating states, $A$ actions and\n$\\Gamma^{\\texttt{C}} \\leq S^{\\texttt{C}}$ possible communicating next states,\nwe derive a $\\widetilde{O}(D^{\\texttt{C}} \\sqrt{\\Gamma^{\\texttt{C}}\nS^{\\texttt{C}} AT})$ regret bound, where $D^{\\texttt{C}}$ is the diameter\n(i.e., the longest shortest path) of the communicating part of the MDP. This is\nin contrast with optimistic algorithms (e.g., UCRL, Optimistic PSRL) that\nsuffer linear regret in weakly-communicating MDPs, as well as posterior\nsampling or regularised algorithms (e.g., REGAL), which require prior knowledge\non the bias span of the optimal policy to bias the exploration to achieve\nsub-linear regret. We also prove that in weakly-communicating MDPs, no\nalgorithm can ever achieve a logarithmic growth of the regret without first\nsuffering a linear regret for a number of steps that is exponential in the\nparameters of the MDP.

Physical-model neuromorphic devices\nseek to replicate not only this inherent parallelism, but also aspects of its\nmicroscopic dynamics in analog circuits emulating neurons and synapses.\nHowever, these machines require network models that are not only adept at\nsolving particular tasks, but that can also cope with the inherent\nimperfections of analog substrates. We present a spiking network model that\nperforms Bayesian inference through sampling on the BrainScaleS neuromorphic\nplatform, where we use it for generative and discriminative computations on\nvisual data. By illustrating its functionality on this platform, we implicitly\ndemonstrate its robustness to various substrate-specific distortive effects, as\nwell as its accelerated capability for computation.

Motivated by recent experimental studies that have addressed\nthe stepping behavior of kinesins on microtubules, we investigate a lattice gas\nmodel for simultaneous transport of two species of active particles on a\ncylinder. The species are distinguished by their different gaits: While the\nfirst species moves straight ahead, the second follows a helical path. We show\nthat the collective properties of such systems critically differ from those of\none-species transport in a way that cannot be accounted for by standard models.\nThis is most evident in a jamming transition far below full occupation, as well\nas in non-equilibrium pattern formation. The altered behavior arises because -\nunlike the case in single-species transport - any given position may be\ntargeted by two particles from different directions at the same time. However,\na particle can leave a given position only in one direction. This simple change\nin connectivity significantly amplifies the impact of steric interactions and\nthus becomes a key determinant of mixed species transport.

Its aim is to\nexplore the energy frontier, providing sensitivity to physics beyond the\nStandard Model (BSM) and precision measurements of Standard Model processes\nwith an emphasis on Higgs boson and top-quark physics. The opportunities for\ntop-quark physics at CLIC are discussed in this paper. The initial stage of\noperation focuses on top-quark pair production measurements, as well as the\nsearch for rare flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) top-quark decays. It\nalso includes a top-quark pair production threshold scan around 350 GeV which\nprovides a precise measurement of the top-quark mass in a well-defined\ntheoretical framework. At the higher-energy stages, studies are made of\ntop-quark pairs produced in association with other particles. A study of ttH\nproduction including the extraction of the top Yukawa coupling is presented as\nwell as a study of vector boson fusion (VBF) production, which gives direct\naccess to high-energy electroweak interactions. Operation above 1 TeV leads to\nmore highly collimated jet environments where dedicated methods are used to\nanalyse the jet constituents. These techniques enable studies of the top-quark\npair production, and hence the sensitivity to BSM physics, to be extended to\nhigher energies. This paper also includes phenomenological interpretations that\nmay be performed using the results from the extensive top-quark physics\nprogramme at CLIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 15:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 11:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 16:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 17:24:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

The difficulty\nof this problem is exacerbated by the fact that the parameters associated with\na given power system model can range from slightly uncertain to entirely\nunknown. In this paper, a Bayesian framework, via a two-stage Maximum A\nPosteriori optimization routine, is employed in order to locate the most\nprobable source of a forced oscillation given an uncertain prior model.

First, we numerically propagated the Cartesian\nequations of motion of the Jovian system for the period under examination, and\nby comparing the results with a suitable set of ephemerides, we derived the\nmain dynamical effects on the target quantities. Using these effects, we built\nan alternative Hamiltonian formulation and used the normal forms theory to\nlocate the resonance and to compute its main amplitude and frequency. From the\nCartesian model we observe that on the timescale considered and with\nephemerides as initial conditions, both the librating argument and the\ndiagnostics are well approximated by considering the mutual gravitational\ninteractions of Jupiter and the Galilean moons (including Callisto), and the\neffect of Jupiter's J2 harmonic. Under the same initial conditions, the\nHamiltonian formulation in which Callisto and J2 are reduced to their secular\ncontributions achieves larger errors for the quantities above, particularly for\nthe librating argument.

In most\nheuristic algorithms for the tensor-ring decomposition, one encounters the\nproblem of local-minima trapping. Particularly, the minima related to the\ntopological structure in the correlation are hard to escape. Therefore,\nidentification of the correlation structure, somewhat analogous to finding\nmatching ends of entangled strings, is the task of central importance. We show\nhow this problem naturally arises in physical applications, and present a\nstrategy for winning this string-pull game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 03:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

While the\nfamiliar hydrogenic pseudo-ground state of Ps is caused by the Coulomb\nattraction of electron and anti-electron, modified by small spin-spin and\nradiative QED corrections, the proper ground state is caused by the magnetic\nattraction between electron and anti-electron, which dominates over the\nelectric one at short distances. This finding suggests that the familiar\n\"annihilation\" of electron and anti-electron is, in reality, simply yet another\ntransition between two atomic energy levels, with the energy difference\nradiated off in form of photons --- except that the energy difference is huge:\nabout 1 MeV instead of the few eV in a hydrogenic transition. In their proper\nground state configuration the two particles would be so close that they would\nelectromagnetically neutralize each other for most practical purposes, thus\ngiving the appearance of an annihilation. Once in such a tightly bound state\nsuch pairs would hardly interact with normal matter and not be noticeable ---\nexcept through their gravitational effects in bulk!

We illustrate the\nmethodology by focusing on elastic wave propagation in a one-dimensional\nperiodic rod. The governing equations describing the wave propagation problem\nin inhomogeneous systems typically consist of partial differential equations\nwith spatially varying coefficients. Even for very simple systems, these models\nrequire numerical solutions which are computationally expensive and do not\nprovide the valuable insights associated with closed-form solutions. We will\nshow that fractional calculus can provide a powerful approach to develop\ncomprehensive mathematical models of inhomogeneous systems that can effectively\nbe regarded as homogenized models. Although at first glance the mathematics\nmight appear more complex, these fractional order models can allow the\nderivation of closed-form analytical solutions that provide excellent\nestimations of the systems' dynamic responses. Equally important, these\nsolutions are valid in a frequency range that goes largely beyond the\nwell-known homogenization limit of traditional integer order approaches,\ntherefore providing a possible route to high-frequency homogenization. More\nspecifically, this study focuses on the analyses of the dispersion and\npropagation properties of a periodic medium under single-tone harmonic\nexcitation and illustrates the methodology to obtain a space-fractional wave\nequation capable of capturing the behavior of the physical system. The\nfractional wave equation and its analytical solution are compared with\nnumerical results obtained via a traditional finite element method in order to\nassess their validity and evaluate their performance. It is found that the\nresulting fractional differential models are, in their most general form, of\ncomplex and frequency-dependent order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2018 18:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}
