The method we propose is based on writing\nthese layer potentials in spherical coordinates where the point at which their\nkernels are peaked maps to the north pole. An N-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature\nrule is used for integration with respect to the the polar angle rather than\nthe cosine of the polar angle. A 2N-point periodic trapezoid rule is used to\ncompute the integral with respect to the azimuthal angle which acts as a\nnatural and effective averaging operation in this coordinate system. The\nnumerical method resulting from combining these two quadrature rules in this\nrotated coordinate system yields results that are consistent with asymptotic\nbehaviors of the double- and single-layer potentials at close evaluation\ndistances. In particular, we show that the error in computing the double-layer\npotential, after applying a subtraction method, is quadratic with respect to\nthe evaluation distance from the boundary, and the error is linear for the\nsingle-layer potential.

We begin by constructing mode solutions to the classical\nKlein-Gordon-Fock equation with potential on the whole spacetime. For a given\neigen-mode solution of the IN region of the spacetime ($t<0$), we determine its\nevolution into the OUT region ($t>0$) through the use of a Fourier\ndecomposition in terms of the OUT region eigen-modes. The classical system is\nthen second quantized in the canonical quantization scheme. On the OUT region,\nthere is a unitarily equivalent representation of the quantized field in terms\nof the OUT region eigen-modes, including zero-frequency modes which we also\nquantize in a manner which allows for their interpretation as particles in the\ntypical sense. After determining the Bogolubov coefficients between the two\nrepresentations, we study the production of quanta out of the vacuum when the\npotential turns off. We find that the number of \"particles\" created on the OUT\nregion is finite for the standard modes, and with the usual ambiguity in the\nnumber of particles created in the zero frequency modes. We then look at the\nrenormalized expectation value of the stress-energy-tensor on the IN and OUT\nregions for the IN vacuum state. We find that the resulting stress-tensor can\nviolate the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions because the\nstandard Casimir energy-density of the cylinder spacetime is negative.

Towards this end, we first\nobtain a good reference of the original image groups by using the image NSS\nprior, and then the rank residual of the image groups between this reference\nand the degraded image is minimized to achieve a better estimate to the desired\nimage. In this manner, both the reference and the estimated image are updated\ngradually and jointly in each iteration. Based on the group-based sparse\nrepresentation model, we further provide a theoretical analysis on the\nfeasibility of the proposed RRC model.

The\nvortex-atoms theory identified chemical elements as topologically different\nvortex knots, and matter was interpreted as bound states of these knotted\nvortices. This work initiated the field of knot theory in mathematics. It also\ninfluenced modern physics, where a close although incomplete analogy exists\nwith the theory of superfluidity, which started with Onsager's and Feynman's\nintroduction of quantum vortices. Indeed many macroscopic properties of\nsuperconductors and superfluids are indeed determined by vortex lines forming\ndifferent \"aggregate states\", such as vortex crystals and liquids. While\ncrucial importance of knots was understood for many physical systems in the\nrecent years, there is no known physical realization of the central element of\nKelvin theory: the stable particle-like vortex knot. Indeed, vortex loops and\nknots in superfluids and ordinary superconductors form as dynamical excitations\nand are unstable by Derrick theorem. This instability in fact dictates many of\nthe universal macroscopic properties of superfluids. Here we show that there\nare superconducting states with principally different properties of the\nvorticity: where vortex knots are intrinsically stable. We demonstrate that\nsuch features should be realised near certain critical points, where the\nhydro-magneto-statics of superconducting states yields stables vortex knots\nwhich behave similar to those envisaged in Kelvin and Tait's theory of\nvortex-atoms in luminiferous aether.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 17:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

Two\ngalaxies turn out to be dusty objects at lower redshifts (z<2.5), and are the\nonly two detected in the sub-mm with ALMA. High equivalent-width [OIII] was\nobserved in two galaxies, contributing up to 30% of the K-band flux and\nmimicking the colors of an old stellar population. This implies a failure rate\nof only 20% for the UVJ selection at these redshifts. Balmer absorption was\nidentified in 4 of the brighest galaxies, confirming the absence of OB stars.\nModeling all QGs with a wide range of star-formation histories, we find sSFR a\nfactor of 10 below the main sequence (MS) for all but one galaxy, and less than\n0.01 Gyr$^{-1}$ for half of the sample.

We then find that these\nQGs have quenched on average 300 Myr before observation, between z=3.5 and 5,\nand that they formed at z~5.5 with a mean SFR~300 Msun/yr.

Overall, these results confirm the existence\nof an unexpected population of QGs at z>3, and offer the first insights on\ntheir formation history.

Hence clusters evolving in cuspier dark matter halos are\ncharacterized by more compact sizes, higher velocity dispersions and remain\napproximately isotropic at all clustercentric distances. Conversely, clusters\nin cored halos can expand more and develop a velocity distribution profile that\nbecomes increasingly radially anisotropic at larger clustercentric distances.\nFinally, the larger velocity dispersion of clusters evolving in cuspier dark\nmatter profiles results in them having longer relaxation times. Hence clusters\nin cuspy galaxies relax at a slower rate and, consequently, they are both less\nmass segregated and farther from complete energy equipartition than cluster's\nin cored galaxies.

The goal is to establish objective and repeatable\ngesture definitions based on discernible intent. Such a standard would support\nthe sharing of data and results between researchers working on the problem of\nautomatic monitoring of dietary intake. We define five gestures: taking a bite\nof food (bite), sipping a drink of liquid (drink), manipulating food for\npreparation of intake (utensiling), not moving (rest) and a non-eating category\n(other). To test this lexicography, we used our definitions to label a large\ndata set and tested for inter-rater reliability. The data set consists of a\ntotal of 276 participants eating a single meal while wearing a watch-like\ndevice to track wrist motion. Video was simultaneously recorded and\nsubsequently reviewed to label gestures. A total of 18 raters manually labeled\n51,614 gestures. Every meal was labeled by at least 1 rater, with 95 meals\nlabeled by 2 raters. Inter-rater reliability was calculated in terms of\nagreement, boundary ambiguity, and mistakes. Results were 92.5% agreement (75%\nexact agreement, 17.5% boundary ambiguity). Mistakes of intake gestures (0.6%\nbite and 1.9% drink) occur much less frequently than non-intake gestures (16.5%\nutensiling and 8.7% rest). Similar rates were found across all 18 raters.\nFinally, a comparison of gesture segments against single index labels of bites\nand drinks from a previous effort showed an agreement of 95.8% with 0.6%\nambiguity and 3.6% mistakes.

We propose metric-based adversarial\ndiscriminative domain adaptation (M-ADDA) which performs two main steps. First,\nit uses a metric learning approach to train the source model on the source\ndataset by optimizing the triplet loss function. This results in clusters where\nembeddings of the same label are close to each other and those with different\nlabels are far from one another. Next, it uses the adversarial approach (as\nthat used in ADDA \\cite{2017arXiv170205464T}) to make the extracted features\nfrom the source and target datasets indistinguishable.

More importantly, we design an\noptimization framework that captures a fundamental tradeoff between energy\nefficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. In particular, we\nformulate a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem that maximizes\nEE while taking into consideration of users' buffer occupancy, data rate\nfairness, energy causality constraints and interference constraints. We further\nprove that the proposed optimization framework is an NP-Hard problem. Thus, we\npropose a low complex heuristic algorithm, called INSTANT, to solve the\nresource allocation and energy harvesting optimization problem. The proposed\nalgorithm is shown to be capable of achieving near optimal solution with high\naccuracy while having polynomial complexity. The efficiency of our proposal is\nvalidated through well designed simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2018 20:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

While most existing approaches have\nfocused on training multiple shallow sub-networks jointly, we study training\nthin sub-networks instead. To this end, we first build many inclusive thin\nsub-networks (of the same depth) under a minor modification of existing\nmulti-branch DNNs, and found that they can significantly outperform the\nstate-of-art dense architecture for anytime prediction. This is remarkable due\nto their simplicity and effectiveness, but training many thin sub-networks\njointly faces a new challenge on training complexity.

Changes in the planetary system during the evolution of the\nstar lead to a change in the location of secular resonances.

A\ngeneralization of this equation to Schwartz distributions is defined and a\nSchwartz distribution, which satisfies that equation is called a resolvent\ndistribution. Its restriction to the subset, where it is continuous, is the\nusual resolvent function. Its complex conjugate derivative is,but a factor, the\nspectral Schwartz distribution, which is carried by a subset of the spectral\nset of the operator. The spectral distribution yields a spectral decomposition.\nThe spectral distribution of a matrix and a unitary operator are given. If the\nthe operator is a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space, the spectral\ndistribution is the derivative of the spectral family. We calculate the\nspectral distribution of the multiplication operator and some rank one\nperturbations. These operators are not necessarily self adjoint and may have\ndiscrete real or imaginary eigenvalues or a nontrivial Jordan decomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 06:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

The symmetry breaking\nresults in the emission of a strong chiral signal in the form of otherwise\n'forbidden' harmonics (i.e., that are not emitted from achiral media). The\nintensity of these symmetry-forbidden harmonics is directly correlated to the\nmedia's enantiomeric excess, yielding chiral selectivity.

To address this problem, we connected state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamical simulations of a circumplanetary disk around a Jupiter-mass\nplanet with dust growth and drift model in a post-processing step. We found\nthat there is an efficient pathway to satellitesimal formation if there is a\ndust trap forming within the disk. Thanks to the natural existence of an\noutward gas flow region in the hydrodynamical simulation, a significant dust\ntrap arises at the radial distance of 85~R$_{\\rm J}$ from the planet, where the\ndust-to-gas ratio becomes high enough to trigger streaming instability. The\nstreaming instability leads to the efficient formation of the satellite seeds.\nBecause of the constant infall of material from the circumstellar disk and the\nvery short timescale of dust evolution, the circumplanetary disk acts as a\nsatellitesimal factory, constantly processing the infalling dust to pebbles\nthat gather in the dust trap and undergo the streaming instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 09:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

For it\nis claimed that, in certain theories of quantum gravity, spacetime\n'disappears': and this suggests that one may have sensible physical theories in\nwhich spacetime is completely absent. This makes the philosophical question\nwhether such theories are intelligible, even more pressing. And if such\ntheories are intelligible, the question then is how they manage to do so. In\nthis paper, we adapt the contextual theory of scientific understanding,\ndeveloped by one of us, to fit the novel challenges posed by physical theories\nwithout spacetime. We construe understanding as a matter of skill rather than\njust knowledge. The appeal is thus to understanding, rather than explanation,\nbecause we will be concerned with the tools that scientists have at their\ndisposal for understanding these theories. Our central thesis is that such\nphysical theories can provide scientific understanding, and that such\nunderstanding does not require spacetimes of any sort. Our argument consists of\nfour consecutive steps: (a) We argue, from the general theory of scientific\nunderstanding, that although visualization is an oft-used tool for\nunderstanding, it is not a necessary condition for it; (b) we criticise certain\nmetaphysical preconceptions which can stand in the way of recognising how\nintelligibility without spacetime can be had; (c) we catalogue tools for\nrendering theories without a spacetime intelligible; and (d) we give examples\nof cases in which understanding is attained without a spacetime, and explain\nwhat kind of understanding these examples provide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 09:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

Standard potential\npredictability models only estimate the fraction of the total variance in the\nindex attributable to external forcing. In addition, our methodology allows us\nto partition individual seasonal means into forced, slow, fast and error\ncomponents.

By means of a highly simplified numerical model, it is shown that\nincreasing the fractal depth elevates the dimension of the chaotic dynamics,\nleading to high-order hyperchaos. This result is overall confirmed by SPICE\nsimulations and experiments, which however also reveal that the non-ideal\nbehavior of physical components hinders obtaining high-dimensional dynamics.\nThe issue could be practically mitigated by building the Foster equivalent\nnetworks rather than the verbatim fractals. Furthermore, it is shown that\nconsiderably more complex resonances, and consequently richer dynamics, can be\nobtained by rendering the fractal resonators irregular through reshuffling the\ninductors, or even by inserting a limited number of focal imperfections. The\npresent results draw attention to the potential usefulness of fractal\nresonators for generating high-dimensional chaotic dynamics, and underline the\nimportance of irregularities and component non-idealities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 15:02:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 14:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

As a prominent example, the integer\nquantum Hall effect (QHE) represents a topological phase generally regarded as\ncharacteristic for two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems, and its many\naspects can be understood without invoking electron-electron interaction. The\nintriguing possibility of generalizing QHE to three-dimensional (3D) systems\nwas proposed decades ago, yet it remains elusive experimentally. Here, we\nreport clear experimental evidence for the 3D QHE observed in bulk ZrTe5\ncrystals. Owing to the extremely high sample quality, the extreme quantum limit\nwith only the lowest Landau level occupied can be achieved by an applied\nmagnetic field as low as 1.5 T. Remarkably, in this regime, we observe a\ndissipationless longitudinal resistivity rho_xx=0 accompanied with a\nwell-developed Hall resistivity plateau rho_xy=(1\\pm0.1) h/e^2\n(\\lambda_(F,z)/2), where \\lambda_(F,z) is the Fermi wavelength along the field\ndirection (z axis). This striking result strongly suggests a Fermi surface\ninstability driven by the enhanced interaction effects in the extreme quantum\nlimit. In addition, with further increasing magnetic field, both rho_xx and\nrho_xy increase dramatically and display an interesting metal-insulator\ntransition, representing another magnetic field driven quantum phase\ntransition. Our findings not only unambiguously reveal a novel quantum state of\nmatter resulting from an intricate interplay among dimensionality, interaction,\nand symmetry breaking, but also provide a promising platform for further\nexploration of more exotic quantum phases and transitions in 3D systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 15:44:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 16:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Ideally,\nthey should feature low insertion loss, low drive voltage, large modulation\nbandwidth, high linearity, compact footprint and low manufacturing cost.\nUnfortunately, these criteria have only been achieved on separate\noccasions.Based on a Silicon and Lithium Niobate hybrid integration platform,\nwe demonstrate Mach-Zehnder modulators that simultaneously fulfill these\ncriteria. The presented device exhibits an insertion loss of 2.5 dB,\nvoltage-length product of 2.2 Vcm, high linearity, electro-optic bandwidth of\nat least 70 GHz and modulation rates up to 112 Gbit/s. The high-performance\nmodulator is realized by seamless integration of high-contrast waveguide based\non Lithium Niobate - the most mature modulator material - with compact,\nlow-loss silicon circuits. The hybrid platform demonstrated here allows for the\ncombination of 'best-in-breed' active and passive components, opening up new\navenues for enabling future high-speed, energy efficient and cost-effective\noptical communication networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 08:33:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 06:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}
