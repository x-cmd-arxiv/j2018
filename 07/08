Traditional\nspare strategies for satellite constellations cannot handle these\nmega-constellations due to their limited scalability in number of satellites\nand/or frequency of failures. In this paper, we propose a novel spare strategy\nusing an inventory management approach. We consider a set of parking orbits at\na lower altitude than the constellation for spare storage, and model satellite\nconstellation spare strategy problem using a multi-echelon (s,Q)-type inventory\npolicy, viewing Earth's ground as a supplier, parking orbits as warehouses, and\nin-plane spare stocks as retailers. This inventory model is unique in that the\nparking orbits (warehouses) drift away from the orbital planes over time due to\norbital mechanics' effects, and the in-plane spare stocks (retailers) would\nreceive the resupply from the closest (i.e., minimum waiting time) available\nwarehouse at the time of delivery. The parking orbits (warehouses) are also\nresupplied from the ground (supplier) with stochastic lead time caused by the\norder processing and launch opportunities, leveraging the cost saving effects\nby launching many satellites in one rocket (i.e., batch launch discount). The\nproposed analytical model is validated against simulations using Latin\nHypercube Sampling. Furthermore, based on the proposed model, an optimization\nformulation is introduced to identify the optimal spare strategy, comprising\nthe parking orbits characteristics and all locations policies, to minimize the\nmaintenance cost of the system given performance requirements. The proposed\nmodel and optimization method are applied to a real-world case study of\nsatellite mega-constellation to demonstrate their value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 16:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 18:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 03:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 21:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

Experimental observations of two grades of\nsynthesized graphene and CNT nano-oils show that the nanomaterials not only\nimprove the average breakdown voltage but also significantly improve the\nreliability and survival probabilities of the oils under AC high voltage\nstressing. Improvement of the tune of ~ 70-80 % in the AC breakdown voltage of\nthe oils has been obtained via the present concept.

The CNN-PCA method is inspired by recent developments in\ncomputer vision using deep learning. CNN-PCA can be viewed as a generalization\nof an existing optimization-based PCA (O-PCA) method. Both CNN-PCA and O-PCA\nentail post-processing a PCA model to better honor complex geological features.\nIn CNN-PCA, rather than use a histogram-based regularization as in O-PCA, a new\nregularization involving a set of metrics for multipoint statistics is\nintroduced. The metrics are based on summary statistics of the nonlinear filter\nresponses of geological models to a pre-trained deep CNN. In addition, in the\nCNN-PCA formulation presented here, a convolutional neural network is trained\nas an explicit transform function that can post-process PCA models quickly.\nCNN-PCA is shown to provide both unconditional and conditional realizations\nthat honor the geological features present in reference SGeMS geostatistical\nrealizations for a binary channelized system. Flow statistics obtained through\nsimulation of random CNN-PCA models closely match results for random SGeMS\nmodels for a demanding case in which O-PCA models lead to significant\ndiscrepancies. Results for history matching are also presented. In this\nassessment CNN-PCA is applied with derivative-free optimization, and a subspace\nrandomized maximum likelihood method is used to provide multiple posterior\nmodels. Data assimilation and significant uncertainty reduction are achieved\nfor existing wells, and physically reasonable predictions are also obtained for\nnew wells. Finally, the CNN-PCA method is extended to a more complex\nnon-stationary bimodal deltaic fan system, and is shown to provide high-quality\nrealizations for this challenging example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 20:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

The\nevaporation kinetics of pendant droplets of electrically conducting saline\nsolutions in the presence of a transverse, alternating electric field is\ninvestigated experimentally. It has been observed that while increase of field\nstrength arrests the evaporation, increment in field frequency has the opposite\neffect. The same has been explained on the solvation kinetics of the ions in\nthe polar water. Theoretical analysis reveals that change in surface tension\nand diffusion driven evaporation model cannot predict the arrested or\ndecelerated evaporation. With the aid of Particle Image Velocimetry,\nsuppression of internal circulation velocity within the droplet is observed\nunder electric field stimulus, and this affects the evaporation rate directly.\nA mathematical scaling model is proposed to quantify the effects of\nelectrohydrodynamic circulation, electrothermal and electro-solutal advection\non the evaporation kinetics of the droplet. The analysis encompasses major\ngoverning parameters, viz. the thermal and solutal Marangoni numbers, the\nElectrohydrodynamic number, the electro Prandtl and electro Schmidt numbers and\ntheir respective contributions. It has been shown that the electrothermal\nMarangoni effect is supressed by the electric field, leading to deteriorated\nevaporation rates. Additionally, the electrosolutal Marangoni effect further\nsupresses the internal advection, which again arrests the evaporation rate by a\nlarger proportion. Stability analysis reveals that the electric body force\nretards the stable internal circulation within such droplets and arrests\nadvection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 21:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

In the developed solution, the base stations learn how to predict that\na certain link will experience blockage in the next few time frames using their\npast observations of adopted beamforming vectors. This allows the serving base\nstation to proactively hand-over the user to another base station with a highly\nprobable LOS link.

We performed three activation\nlikelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, comparing two load levels of the\nn-back task (2-back, 3-back) to the PASAT and to each-other. These analyses\naimed to determine the involvement of cognitive and emotional brain regions for\nthese tasks. Results: We observed higher overall likelihood of activation the\nfrontal eye fields in the 3-back. The PASAT exhibited higher overall activation\nin the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), left supramarginal gyrus, and\nleft superior parietal lobule. Furthermore, the 3-back exhibited higher\nactivation in the right SMA, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex versus the\n2-back, and the PASAT exhibited higher activation in a cluster near the right\npremotor area versus the 2-back. A laterality effect was observed in the\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the PASAT (left) and 3-back(right).\nThese data suggest greater activation of regions traditionally associated with\nthe phonological loop during the PASAT, compared to the 2- and 3-back tasks.\nFurthermore, individual ALE analyses suggest involvement of emotional\nprocessing and salience network regions (insula, cingulate) in addition to the\nwell-established verbal working memory regions (Broca's region, bilateral SMA,\npremotor, posterior parietal cortices) in all 3 tasks.

The remote observer has access to a\ndiscrete memoryless source, and communicates its observations to the detector\nvia a rate-limited noiseless channel. The detector observes another discrete\nmemoryless source, and performs a binary hypothesis test on the joint\ndistribution of its own observations with those of the observer. While the goal\nof the observer is to maximize the type II error exponent of the test for a\ngiven type I error probability constraint, it also wants to keep a private part\nof its observations as oblivious to the detector as possible. Considering both\nequivocation and average distortion under a causal disclosure assumption as\npossible measures of privacy, the trade-off between the communication rate from\nthe observer to the detector, the type II error exponent, and privacy is\nstudied. For the general HT problem, we establish single-letter inner bounds on\nboth the rate-error exponent-equivocation and rate-error exponent-distortion\ntrade-offs. Subsequently, single-letter characterizations for both trade-offs\nare obtained (i) for testing against conditional independence of the observer's\nobservations from those of the detector, given some additional side-information\nat the detector; and (ii) when the communication rate constraint over the\nchannel is zero. Finally, we show by providing a counterexample that, the\nstrong converse which holds for distributed HT without a privacy constraint,\ndoes not hold when a privacy constraint is imposed.

In particular, the\nrelation between the cell's doubling time and the ribosome assembly time is not\nknown. Here we develop a model that connects growth rate to ribosome assembly\ntime and show that the existence of a self-assembly step increases the overall\ngrowth rate, because during ribosome self-assembly existing ribosomes can start\na new round of reproduction, by making a new batch of ribosomal proteins prior\nto the completion of the previous round. This overlapping of ribosome\nreproduction cycles increases growth rate beyond the serial-limit that is\ntypically assumed to hold. Using recent data from ribosome profiling and well\nknown measurements of the average translation rate, rigid bounds on the in-vivo\nribosome self-assembly time are set, which are robust to the assumptions\nregarding the biological noises involved. At 21 minutes doubling time, the\nribosome assembly time is found to be approximately 6 minutes --- three fold\nlarger than the common estimate.

The key to reasoning\nabout these mixed programs is Siek-Vitousek-Cimini-Boyland's (dynamic) gradual\nguarantee, which says that giving components of a program more precise types\nonly adds runtime type checking, and does not otherwise change behavior. In\nthis paper, we give a semantic reformulation of the gradual guarantee called\ngraduality. We change the name to promote the analogy that graduality is to\ngradual typing what parametricity is to polymorphism. Each gives a\nlocal-to-global, syntactic-to-semantic reasoning principle that is formulated\nin terms of a kind of observational approximation.\n  Utilizing the analogy, we develop a novel logical relation for proving\ngraduality. We show that embedding-projection pairs (ep pairs) are to\ngraduality what relations are to parametricity. We argue that casts between two\ntypes where one is \"more dynamic\" (less precise) than the other necessarily\nform an ep pair, and we use this to cleanly prove the graduality cases for\ncasts from the ep-pair property. To construct ep pairs, we give an analysis of\nthe type dynamism relation (also known as type precision or naive subtyping)\nthat interprets the rules for type dynamism as compositional constructions on\nep pairs, analogous to the coercion interpretation of subtyping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 09:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

It is best-suited for\noptimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates\nstochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the\nobjective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian\nmachine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an\nacquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In\nthis tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian\nprocess regression and three common acquisition functions: expected\nimprovement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more\nadvanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in\nparallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization,\nexpensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task\nBayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude\nwith a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research\ndirections in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a\ngeneralization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the\nnoise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is\njustified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to\nprevious ad hoc modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 13:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

Graph embedding, which maps\ngraphs to a vectorial space, has been proposed as a way to tackle these\ndifficulties enabling the use of standard machine learning techniques. However,\nit is well known that graph embedding functions usually suffer from the loss of\nstructural information. In this paper, we consider the hierarchical structure\nof a graph as a way to mitigate this loss of information. The hierarchical\nstructure is constructed by topologically clustering the graph nodes, and\nconsidering each cluster as a node in the upper hierarchical level. Once this\nhierarchical structure is constructed, we consider several configurations to\ndefine the mapping into a vector space given a classical graph embedding, in\nparticular, we propose to make use of the Stochastic Graphlet Embedding (SGE).\nBroadly speaking, SGE produces a distribution of uniformly sampled low to high\norder graphlets as a way to embed graphs into the vector space. In what\nfollows, the coarse-to-fine structure of a graph hierarchy and the statistics\nfetched by the SGE complements each other and includes important structural\ninformation with varied contexts. Altogether, these two techniques\nsubstantially cope with the usual information loss involved in graph embedding\ntechniques, obtaining a more robust graph representation. This fact has been\ncorroborated through a detailed experimental evaluation on various benchmark\ngraph datasets, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 15:33:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 17:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

We examine this heating in the context of\ninelastic dark matter, for which signals in conventional nuclear-recoil based\ndirect detection experiments are highly suppressed when the momentum transfer\nis small compared to the mass splitting between dark matter states.

Despite the great progress of video captioning research,\nparticularly on video feature encoding, the language decoder is still largely\nbased on the prevailing RNN decoder such as LSTM, which tends to prefer the\nfrequent word that aligns with the video. In this paper, we propose a\nboundary-aware hierarchical language decoder for video captioning, which\nconsists of a high-level GRU based language decoder, working as a global\n(caption-level) language model, and a low-level GRU based language decoder,\nworking as a local (phrase-level) language model. Most importantly, we\nintroduce a binary gate into the low-level GRU language decoder to detect the\nlanguage boundaries. Together with other advanced components including joint\nvideo prediction, shared soft attention, and boundary-aware video encoding, our\nintegrated video captioning framework can discover hierarchical language\ninformation and distinguish the subject and the object in a sentence, which are\nusually confusing during the language generation. Extensive experiments on two\nwidely-used video captioning datasets, MSR-Video-to-Text (MSR-VTT)\n\\cite{xu2016msr} and YouTube-to-Text (MSVD) \\cite{chen2011collecting} show that\nour method is highly competitive, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 08:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}
