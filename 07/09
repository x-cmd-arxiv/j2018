Methods: We simulated\n106,623,188 lens systems composed of more than two images, based on a regular\ngrid of parameters characterizing a non-singular isothermal ellipsoid lens\nmodel in the presence of an external shear. These simulations are used as an\ninput for training and testing our supervised learning models consisting of\nExtremely Randomized Trees. The latter are finally used to assign to each of\nthe 2,129,659 clusters of celestial objects a discriminant value that reflects\nthe ability of our simulations to match the observed relative positions and\nfluxes from each cluster.

Another definition of non-locality refers to\nthe wave-function collapse thereby one can prepare a quantum state from\narbitrary far away. In both cases one can debate on whether non-locality is a\nreal physical phenomenon, e.g. one can employ formulations of quantum mechanics\nthat does not use collapse, or one can simply refrain from explaining quantum\ncorrelations via classical hidden variables. Here we point out that there is a\nnon-local effect within quantum mechanics, i.e. without involving hidden\nvariables or collapse. This effect is seen via imprecise (i.e. interval-valued)\njoint probability of two observables, which replaces the ill-defined notion of\nthe precise joint probability for non-commuting observables. It is consistent\nwith all requirements for the joint probability, e.g. those for commuting\nobservales. The non-locality amounts to a fact that (in a two-particle system)\nthe joint imprecise probability of non-commuting two-particle observables (i.e.\ntensor product of single-particle observables) does not factorize into\nsingle-particle contributions, even for uncorrelated states of the two-particle\nsystem. The factorization is recovered for a less precise (i.e. the one\ninvolving a wider interval) joint probability. This approach to non-locality\nreconciles it with locality, since the latter emerges as a less precise\ndescription.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2018 16:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Varying $A_{\\textrm{lens}}$ instead of $r_{0.05}$\nhowever leads to weaker bounds on $\\sum m_{\\nu}$.

As a result, a two-parameter primal-dual nonlinear\nsystem is proposed, which corresponds to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point and the\ninfeasible stationary point of nonlinear programs, respectively, as one of two\nparameters vanishes. Based on this distinctive system, we present a primal-dual\ninterior-point method capable of rapidly detecting infeasibility of nonlinear\nprograms. The method generates interior-point iterates without truncation of\nthe step. It is proved that our method converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point\nof the original problem as the barrier parameter tends to zero.

Some of the most common forms of interpretability systems are\nexample-based, local, and global explanations. One of the main challenges in\ninterpretability is designing explanation systems that can capture aspects of\neach of these explanation types, in order to develop a more thorough\nunderstanding of the model. We address this challenge in a novel model called\nMAPLE that uses local linear modeling techniques along with a dual\ninterpretation of random forests (both as a supervised neighborhood approach\nand as a feature selection method). MAPLE has two fundamental advantages over\nexisting interpretability systems. First, while it is effective as a black-box\nexplanation system, MAPLE itself is a highly accurate predictive model that\nprovides faithful self explanations, and thus sidesteps the typical\naccuracy-interpretability trade-off. Specifically, we demonstrate, on several\nUCI datasets, that MAPLE is at least as accurate as random forests and that it\nproduces more faithful local explanations than LIME, a popular interpretability\nsystem. Second, MAPLE provides both example-based and local explanations and\ncan detect global patterns, which allows it to diagnose limitations in its\nlocal explanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 01:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 13:52:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 21:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

When training and test distributions are\ndifferent, standard supervised learning methods perform poorly. Zero-shot\ndomain adaptation attempts to alleviate this problem by inferring models that\ngeneralize well to unseen domains by using training data in multiple source\ndomains. Existing methods use observed semantic descriptors characterizing\ndomains such as time information to infer the domain-specific models for the\nunseen domains. However, it cannot always be assumed that such metadata can be\nused in real-world applications. The proposed method can infer appropriate\ndomain-specific models without any semantic descriptors by introducing the\nconcept of latent domain vectors, which are latent representations for the\ndomains and are used for inferring the models. The latent domain vector for the\nunseen domain is inferred from the set of the feature vectors in the\ncorresponding domain, which is given in the testing phase. The domain-specific\nmodels consist of two components: the first is for extracting a representation\nof a feature vector to be predicted, and the second is for inferring model\nparameters given the latent domain vector. The posterior distributions of the\nlatent domain vectors and the domain-specific models are parametrized by neural\nnetworks, and are optimized by maximizing the variational lower bound using\nstochastic gradient descent. The effectiveness of the proposed method was\ndemonstrated through experiments using one regression and two classification\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 03:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

However, the full\nexploitation of diamond for these applications is often limited by the\nuncontrolled nature of the diamond material surface, which suffers from\nFermi-level pinning and hosts a significant density of electro-magnetic noise\nsources. These issues occur despite the oxide-free and air-stable nature of the\ndiamond crystal surface, which should be an ideal candidate for\nfunctionalization and chemical-engineering. In this work we reveal a family of\npreviously unidentified and near-ubiquitous primal surface defects which we\nassign to differently reconstructed surface vacancies. The density of these\ndefects is quantified with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, their energy\nstructures are elucidated by ab initio calculations, and their effect on\nnear-surface quantum probes is measured directly. Subsequent ab-initio\ncalculation of band-bending from these defects suggest they are the source of\nFermi-level pinning at most diamond surfaces. Finally, an investigation is\nconducted on a broad range of post-growth surface treatments and concludes that\nnone of them can reproducibly reduce this defect density below the\nFermi-pinning threshold, making this defect a prime candidate as the source for\ndecoherence-limiting noise in near-surface quantum probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 05:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

However, no efforts have been found in the literature,\nfor recognizing human activity in RGB-D videos where several performers are\nperforming simultaneously. In this paper we introduce such a challenging\ndataset with several performers performing the activities. We present a novel\nmethod for recognizing human activities in such videos. The proposed method\naims in capturing the motion information of the whole video by producing a\ndynamic image corresponding to the input video. We use two parallel ResNext-101\nto produce the dynamic images for the RGB video and depth video separately. The\ndynamic images contain only the motion information and hence, the unnecessary\nbackground information are eliminated. We send the two dynamic images extracted\nfrom the RGB and Depth videos respectively, through a fully connected layer of\nneural networks. The proposed dynamic image reduces the complexity of the\nrecognition process by extracting a sparse matrix from a video. However, the\nproposed system maintains the required motion information for recognizing the\nactivity. The proposed method has been tested on the MSR Action 3D dataset and\nhas shown comparable performances with respect to the state-of-the-art.

However, accurate\nestimation of the displacement of myocardial tissue and hence LV strain has\nbeen challenging due to a variety of issues, including those related to\nderiving tracking tokens from images and following tissue locations over the\nentire cardiac cycle. In this work, we propose a point matching scheme where\ncorrespondences are modeled as flow through a graphical network.

The novelty lies in the constraints that are imposed\non the matching scheme, which render the correspondences one-to-one through the\nentire cardiac cycle, and not just two consecutive frames. The constraints also\nencourage motion to be cyclic, which is an important characteristic of LV\nmotion.

Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way.

Given a query point,\nconventional approximate nearest neighbor search calculates the distances to\nthe cluster centroids, before ranking the clusters from near to far based on\nthe distances. The data indexed in the top-ranked clusters are retrieved and\ntreated as the nearest neighbor candidates for the query. However, the loss of\nquantization between the data and cluster centroids will inevitably harm the\nsearch accuracy. To address this problem, the proposed model ranks clusters\nbased on their nearest neighbor probabilities rather than the query-centroid\ndistances. The nearest neighbor probabilities are estimated by employing neural\nnetworks to characterize the neighborhood relationships, i.e., the density\nfunction of nearest neighbors with respect to the query. The proposed\nprobability-based ranking can replace the conventional distance-based ranking\nfor finding candidate clusters, and the predicted probability can be used to\ndetermine the data quantity to be retrieved from the candidate cluster.

The power of\ncrowdsourced delivery stems from the large number of workers potentially\navailable to provide services and reduce costs. It has been shown in social\npsychology literature that fairness is key to ensuring high worker\nparticipation. However, existing assignment solutions fall short on modeling\nthe dynamic fairness metric. In this work, we introduce a new assignment\nstrategy for crowdsourced delivery tasks. This strategy takes fairness towards\nworkers into consideration, while maximizing the task allocation ratio. Since\nredundant assignments are not possible in delivery tasks, we first introduce a\n2-phase allocation model that increases the reliability of a worker to complete\na given task. To realize the effectiveness of our model in practice, we present\nboth offline and online versions of our proposed algorithm called F-Aware.\nGiven a task-to-worker bipartite graph, F-Aware assigns each task to a worker\nthat minimizes unfairness, while allocating tasks to use worker capacities as\nmuch as possible. We present an evaluation of our algorithms with respect to\nrunning time, task allocation ratio (TAR), as well as unfairness and assignment\nratio. Experiments show that F-Aware runs around 10^7 x faster than the\nTAR-optimal solution and allocates 96.9% of the tasks that can be allocated by\nit.

Based on the spiral-arm\ninstability analysis of our Paper I, we present linear perturbation theory of\ndynamical instability of self-gravitating spiral arms of magnetised gas,\nfocusing on the effect of toroidal magnetic fields. Spiral arms can be\ndestabilised by the toroidal fields which cancel Coriolis force, i.e.\nmagneto-Jeans instability. Our analysis can be applied to multi-component\nsystems that consist of gas and stars. To test our analysis, we perform ideal\nmagneto-hydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc galaxies and examine the\nsimulation results. We find that our analysis can characterise dynamical\ninstability leading arms to fragment and form clumps if magnetic fields are\nnearly toroidal. We propose that dimensionless growth rate of the most unstable\nperturbation, which is computed from our analysis, can be used to predict\nfragmentation of spiral arms within an orbital time-scale. Our analysis is\napplicable as long as magnetic fields are nearly toroidal. Using our analytic\nmodel, we estimate a typical mass of clumps forming from spiral-arm\nfragmentation to be consistent with observed giant clumps $\\sim10^{7-8}~{\\rm\nM_\\odot}$. Furthermore, we find that, although the magnetic destabilisation can\ncause low-density spiral arms to fragment, the estimated mass of resultant\nclumps is almost independent from strength of magnetic fields since marginal\ninstability occurs at long wavelengths which compensate the low densities of\nmagnetically destabilised arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 08:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 01:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

The minimum set of postulates to be introduced is that\n(i) the action principle should apply and that(ii) the total action should by\nform-invariant under the (local) diffeomorphism group. The second postulate\nthus implements the Principle of General Relativity. According to Noether's\ntheorem, this physical symmetry gives rise to a conserved Noether current, from\nwhich the complete set of theories compatible with both postulates can be\ndeduced. This finally results in a new generic Einstein-type equation, which\ncan be interpreted as an energy-momentum balance equation emerging from the\nLagrangian $L_{R}$ for the source-free dynamics of gravitation and the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the source system $L_{0}$. Provided that the system\nhas no other symmetries -- such as SU$(N)$ -- the canonical energy-momentum\ntensor turns out to be the correct source term of gravitation. For the case of\nmassive spin particles, this entails an increased weighting of the kinetic\nenergy over the mass in their roles as the source of gravity as compared to the\nmetric energy momentum tensor, which constitutes the source of gravity in\nEinstein's General Relativity. We furthermore confirm that a massive vector\nfield necessarily acts as a source for torsion of spacetime. Thus, from the\nviewpoint of our generic Einstein-type equation, Einstein's General Relativity\nconstitutes the particular case for spin-$0$ and massless spin particle fields,\nand the Hilbert Lagrangian $L_{R,H}$ as the model for the source-free dynamics\nof gravitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 09:24:49 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 12:20:19 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 15:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 19:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 15:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 10:53:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 14:33:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 12:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 12:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 14:31:45 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:47:50 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 08:33:42 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 10:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

We ask whether larger dynamical network\nmotifs exist in biological networks, thus contributing to the higher-order\norganization of a network. To end this, we introduce a gradient descent machine\nlearning (ML) approach and genetic algorithms to learn larger functional motifs\nin contrast to an (unfeasible) exhaustive search. We use the French Flag (FF)\nand Switch functional motif as case studies motivated from biology. While our\nalgorithm successfully learns large functional motifs, we identify a threshold\nsize of approximately 20 nodes beyond which learning breaks down. Therefore we\ninvestigate the stability of the motifs. We find that the size of the real\nnegative eigenvalues of the Jacobian decreases with increasing system size,\nthus conferring instability. Finally, without imposing learning an input-output\nfor all the components of the network, we observe that unconstrained middle\ncomponents of the network still learn the desired function, a form of\nhomogeneous team learning. We conclude that the size limitation of\nlearnability, most likely due to stability constraints, impose a definite\nrequirement for modularity in networked systems while enabling team learning\nwithin unconstrained parts of the module. Thus, the observation that community\nstructures and modularity are abundant in biological networks could be\naccounted for by a computational compositional network structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 09:25:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

Work done over the\npast 20 years as well as recent analyses show a continuity in properties (e.g.,\nBalmer line profiles, blueshifts of high-ionization lines) between sources with\nFWHM above and below 2000 km/s, the defining boundary of NLSy1s. This finding\nalone suggests that comparisons between samples of NLSy1s and rest of\nbroad-line AGNs are most likely biased. NLSy1s can be properly contextualized\nby their location on the quasar main sequence originally defined by Sulentic et\nal 2000. At one end, NLSy1s encompass sources with strong FeII emission and\nassociated with high Eddington ratio that hold the promise of becoming useful\ndistance indicators; at the other end, at least some of them are sources with\nbroad profiles seen face-on. Any rigid FWHM limit gives rise to some physical\nambiguity, as the FWHM of low-ionization lines depends in a complex way on\nmass, Eddington ratio, orientation, and luminosity. In addition, if the scaling\nderived from luminosity and virial dynamics applies to the broad line regions,\nNLSy1s at luminosity higher than 1E47 erg/s become physically impossible.\nTherefore, in a broader context, a proper subdivision of two distinct classes\nof AGNs and quasars may be achieved by the distinction between Pop.

Hathaway (Solar Physics, 286, 347, 2013) found a\ncurious behaviour in this parameter for small sunspot groups (areas smaller\nthan 100 millionths of solar hemisphere, msh) using records from Royal\nGreenwich Observatory (RGO). Hathaway showed that penumbra-umbra ratio\ndecreased smoothly from more than 7 in 1905 to lower than 3 by 1930 and then\nincreased to almost 8 in 1961. Thus, Hathaway proposed the existence of a\nsecular variation in the penumbra-umbra area ratio. In order to confirm that\nsecular variation, we employ data of the sunspot catalogue published by the\nCoimbra Astronomical Observatory (COI) for the period 1929-1941. Our results\ndisagree with the penumbra-umbra ratio found by Hathaway for that period.\nHowever, the behaviour of this ratio for large (areas greater or equal than 100\nmsh) and small groups registered in COI during 1929-1941 is similar to data\navailable from RGO for the periods 1874-1914 and 1950-1976. Nevertheless, while\nthe average values and time evolution of the ratio in large groups is similar\nto the ratio for small groups according to Coimbra data (1929-1941) it is not\nanalogous for RGO data for the same period. We also found that the behaviour of\nthe penumbra-umbra area ratio for smaller groups in both observatories is\nsignificantly different. The main difference between the area measurements made\nin Coimbra and RGO is associated with the umbra measurements. We would like to\nstress that the two observatories used different methods of observation and\nwhile in COI both methodology and instruments did not change during the study\nperiod, some changes were carried out in RGO that could have affected\nmeasurements of umbra and penumbra.

In this work, the relaxation dynamics of\nphotoexcited carriers of 3D Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 are investigated by\ntransient terahertz spectroscopy. The visible pump-THz probe spectroscopy\nmeasurement shows clear biexponential decays with two characteristic time\nconstants. According to the pump-power and temperature dependence, these two\ncharacteristic time constants are attributed to the electron phonon coupling\n(1-4 ps) and anharmonic decay of hot coupled phonons to electronic uncoupled\nphonons (2-9 ps), respectively. An anomalous electron-optical phonon coupling\nreduction and a bottleneck slowing of hot optical phonons relaxation are\nobserved with higher excitation intensities similar to that in graphene. On the\nother hand, the electron-optical phonon coupling can be enhanced due to the\nphonon frequency broadening and softening at elevated lattice temperature.\nFurthermore, the transient THz spectrum response is strongly modified by the\nphonon assisted intraband absorption of hot carriers from a pure electronic\nDrude model, which is evidenced by a characteristic THz absorption dip in the\ntransient THz absorption spectrum. This absorption dip is pinned by the\ndiscrete optical phonon energy that assists the intraband transition enabled by\nphotoexcitation of hot carriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 11:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

More luminous (more\nmassive) GCs are typically redder and hence more metal-rich. This 'blue tilt'\nis often interpreted as a mass-metallicity relation stemming from GC\nself-enrichment, whereby more massive GCs retain a greater fraction of the\nenriched gas ejected by their evolving stars, fostering the formation of more\nmetal-rich secondary generations. We examine the E-MOSAICS simulations of the\nformation and evolution of galaxies and their GC populations, and find that\ntheir GCs exhibit a colour-luminosity relation similar to that observed in\nlocal galaxies, without the need to invoke mass-dependent self-enrichment. We\nfind that the blue tilt is most appropriately interpreted as a dearth of\nmassive, metal-poor GCs: the formation of massive GCs requires high\ninterstellar gas surface densities, conditions that are most commonly fostered\nby the most massive, and hence most metal rich, galaxies, at the peak epoch of\nGC formation.

The main\nhindrance to the massive deployment of low power nodes is most probably the\nprohibitive maintenance cost of battery replacement and the ecotoxicity of the\nbattery production/end-of-life. An emerging research direction to avoid battery\nreplacement is the combination of radio frequency energy harvesting and mobile\ncomputing (MC).

Motivated by the poor performances exhibited by\nstandard displacement-based finite element formulations, attention is here\nfocused on the use of mixed methods as approximation technique, within the\nsmall strain framework, for the mechanical problem of inelastic bidimensional\nstructures. Despite a great flexibility characterizes mixed element\nformulations, several theoretical and numerical aspects have to be carefully\ntaken into account in the design of a high-performance element. The present\nwork aims at providing the basis for methodological analysis and comparison in\nsuch aspects, within the unified mathematical setting supplied by generalized\nstandard material model and with special interest towards elastoplastic media.\nA critical review of the state-of-the-art computational methods is delivered in\nregard to variational formulations, selection of interpolation spaces,\nnumerical solution strategies and numerical stability. Though those arguments\nare interrelated, a topic-oriented presentation is resorted to, for the very\nrich available literature to be properly examined. Finally, the performances of\nseveral significant mixed finite element formulations are investigated in\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 13:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}

In the\npresent paper we discuss properties of such scaling transformations, with\nregard to their applicability as well as to their determination.\nTransformations of this type are admissible only when certain consistency\nconditions are satisfied, and they lead to singular perturbation scenarios only\nif additional conditions hold, including a further consistency condition on\ninitial values. Given these consistency conditions, two scenarios occur. The\nfirst (which we call standard) is well known and corresponds to a classical\nquasi-steady state (QSS) reduction. Here, scaling may actually be omitted\nbecause there exists a singular perturbation reduction for the unscaled system,\nwith a coordinate subspace as critical manifold. For the second (nonstandard)\nscenario scaling is crucial. Here one may obtain a singular perturbation\nreduction with the slow manifold having dimension greater than expected from\nthe scaling. For parameter dependent systems we consider the problem to find\nall possible scalings, and we show that requiring the consistency conditions\nallows their determination. This lays the groundwork for algorithmic\napproaches, to be taken up in future work. In the final section we consider\nsome applications.

In sports medicine, ECG-based analyses are well\nestablished. However, they rarely consider the correspondence of respiratory\nand cardiac activity. Given such mutual influence, we hypothesize that athlete\nmonitoring might be developed with causal inference and that detailed,\ntime-related techniques should be preceded by a more general, time-independent\napproach that considers the whole group of participants and parameters\ndescribing whole signals. The aim of this study was to discover general causal\npaths among cardiac and respiratory variables in elite athletes in two body\npositions (supine and standing), at rest. ECG and impedance pneumography\nsignals were obtained from 100 elite athletes. The mean HR, the RMSSD, its\nnatural logarithm, the mean respiratory rate, the breathing activity\ncoefficients, and the resulting breathing regularity were estimated. Several\ncausal discovery frameworks were applied: generalized correlations, CAM, FGES,\nGFCI, and two Bayesian network learning algorithms: Hill-Climbing and Tabu. The\nmain, still mild, rules best supported by data are: for supine - tidal volume\ncauses heart activity variation, which causes HR, which causes respiratory\ntiming; and for standing - normalized respiratory activity variation causes\naverage heart activity. The presented approach allows data-driven and\ntime-independent analysis of elite athletes as a particular population, without\nconsidering prior knowledge. However, the results seem to be consistent with\nthe medical background. Causality inference is an interesting mathematical\napproach to the analysis of biological responses, which are complex.

More recently, polymeric carbon nitride materials\nconsisting of triazine or heptazine building blocks have attracted considerable\nattention as hydrogen-evolution photocatalysts.

It is shown\nthat a water molecule which is hydrogen-bonded to an N-heterocycle can be\ndecomposed into hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals by two simple sequential\nphotochemical reactions.

Our\nstudy is based on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS)\nphotometric galaxy catalogue,associated with photometric redshifts. We\nconstructed LFs inside a scaled radius using a selection in photometric\nredshift around the cluster spectroscopic redshift in order to reduce\nprojection effects. The width of the photometric redshift selection was\ncarefully determined to avoid biasing the LF and depended on both the cluster\nredshift and the galaxy magnitudes. The purity was then enhanced by applying a\nprecise background subtraction. We constructed composite luminosity functions\n(CLFs) by stacking the individual LFs and studied their evolution with redshift\nand richness, analysing separately the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and\nnon-BCG members. We fitted the dependences of the CLFs and BCG distributions\nparameters with redshift and richness conjointly in order to distinguish\nbetween these two effects. We find that the usual photometric redshift\nselection methods can bias the LF estimate if the redshift and magnitude\ndependence of the photometric redshift quality is not taken into account. Our\nmain findings concerning the evolution of the galaxy luminosity distribution\nwith redshift and richness are that, in the inner region of clusters and in the\nredshift-mass range we probe (about $0<z<1$ and $10^{13}\nM_{\\odot}<M_{500}<5\\times10^{14}M_{\\odot}$), the bright part of the LF (BCG\nexcluded) does not depend much on mass or redshift except for its amplitude,\nwhereas the BCG luminosity increases both with redshift and richness, and its\nscatter decreases with redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 14:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 10:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

More importantly, having an NIDS, it should be tested on\nmalicious traffic dataset that not only represents known attacks, but also can\nto some extent reflect the characteristics of unknown, zero-day attacks.\nGenerating such traffic is identified in the literature as one of the main\nobstacles for evaluating the effectiveness of NIDS.

Although\nconvolutional networks would seem appropriate for this task, we show that they\nfail spectacularly.

We call this solution\nCoordConv, which works by giving convolution access to its own input\ncoordinates through the use of extra coordinate channels. Without sacrificing\nthe computational and parametric efficiency of ordinary convolution, CoordConv\nallows networks to learn either complete translation invariance or varying\ndegrees of translation dependence, as required by the end task. CoordConv\nsolves the coordinate transform problem with perfect generalization and 150\ntimes faster with 10--100 times fewer parameters than convolution. This stark\ncontrast raises the question: to what extent has this inability of convolution\npersisted insidiously inside other tasks, subtly hampering performance from\nwithin?

Multiple auction\nplatforms, also called Supply-Side Platforms (SSP), were created. Because of\nthis multiplicity, publishers started to create competition between SSPs. In\nthis setting, there are two successive auctions: a second price auction in each\nSSP and a secondary, first price auction, called header bidding auction,\nbetween SSPs.In this paper, we consider an SSP competing with other SSPs for ad\nspaces. The SSP acts as an intermediary between an advertiser wanting to buy ad\nspaces and a web publisher wanting to sell its ad spaces, and needs to define a\nbidding strategy to be able to deliver to the advertisers as many ads as\npossible while spending as little as possible. The revenue optimization of this\nSSP can be written as a contextual bandit problem, where the context consists\nof the information available about the ad opportunity, such as properties of\nthe internet user or of the ad placement.Using classical multi-armed bandit\nstrategies (such as the original versions of UCB and EXP3) is inefficient in\nthis setting and yields a low convergence speed, as the arms are very\ncorrelated.

Throughout this article there\nis an effort to clearly present the physical aspects of PT-symmetry in optical\nmicrocavity systems, but mathematical formulations are reduced to the\nindispensable ones. Readers who prefer strict mathematical treatments should\nresort to the extensive list of references. Despite the rapid progress on the\nsubject, new ideas and applications of PT symmetry using optical microcavities\nare still expected in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 02:09:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 02:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The\nrelevant symmetry of the model is the general coordinate transformation. Then,\nthe entropy production is classified into three categories, when a closed path\nis depicted as a thermodynamic cycle. One category is time reversal odd, and is\nattributed to the number of lines of magnetic flux passing through the closed\npath, having monopole as a source. There are two time reversal even categories,\none of which is attributed to the space curvature around the path, having\ngravitational instanton as a source, which dominates for a rapid operation of\nthe cycle. The last category is the usual one, which remains even for the\nquasi-equilibrium operation. It is possible to extend the model to include\nnon-linear responses. In introducing new terms, important is the dimensional\ncounting, using two parameters, the temperature and the relaxation time. The\neffective action, being induced by the non-equilibrium thermodynamics, is\nderived. This is a candidate for the action which controls the dynamics of\nkinetic coefficients and thermodynamic forces. An example is given in a\nchemical oscillatory reaction in a solvent of the van der Waals type.\nFluctuation-dissipation theorem is examined `a la Onsager, and a derivation of\nthe gravity analog thermodynamic model from quantum mechanics is sketched,\nbased on an analogy to the resonance problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 14:45:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 12:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}
