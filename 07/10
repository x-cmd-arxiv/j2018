The width of the transition\ndepends on a free parameter, the pressure increment relative to the critical\npressure of a Maxwell construction. As an example we present a trigonometric\nfunction ansatz for the switch function together with a pressure increment\nduring the transition. We note that the resulting mixed phase equation of state\nbears similarities with the appearance of substitutional compounds in neutron\nstar crusts and with the sequence of transitions between different pasta phases\nin the hadron-to-quark matter transition.

The key concepts of Kliko are the encapsulation of data\nprocessing software into a container and the formalization of the input, output\nand task parameters. By formalizing the parameters, the software is represented\nas abstract building blocks with a uniform and consistent interface. The main\nadvantage is enhanced scriptability and empowering pipeline composition.\nFormalization is realized by bundling a container with a Kliko file, which\ndescribes the IO and task parameters. This Kliko container can then be opened\nand run by a Kliko runner. The Kliko runner will parse the Kliko definition and\ngather the values for these parameters, for example by requesting user input or\nretrieving pre-defined values from disk. Parameters can be various primitive\ntypes, for example: float, int or the path to a file. This paper will also\ndiscuss the implementation of a support library named Kliko which can be used\nto create Kliko containers, parse Kliko definitions, chain Kliko containers in\nworkflows using a workflow manager library such as Luigi.

The\nelectrohydrodynamics of a drop is governed by inherent deformability of the\ndrop (defined by capillary number), the electric field strength (defined by\nMasson number) and the surface charge convection (quantified by electric\nReynolds number). Surface charge convection generates nonlinearilty in a\nelectrohydrodynamics problem by coupling the electric field and flow field. In\nStokes limit, most existing theoretical models either considered weak charge\nconvection or weak electric field to solve the problem. In the present work,\ngravitational settling of the drop is investigated analytically and numerically\nin Stokes limit considering significant electric field strength and surface\ncharge convection. Drop deformation accurate upto higher order is calculated\nanalytically in small deformation regime. Our theoretical results show\nexcellent agreement with the numerical and shows improvement over previous\ntheoretical models. For drops falling with moderate Reynolds number, the effect\nof Masson number on transient drop dynamics is studied for (i) perfect\ndielectric drop in perfect dielectric medium (ii) leaky dielectric drop in the\nleaky dielectric medium. For the latter case transient deformation and velocity\nobtained for significant charge convection is compared with that of absence in\ncharge convection which is the novelty of our study. The present study suggests\nthat for both the regimes, surface charge convection tends to increase or\ndecrease the settling speed depending upon the ratios of electrical properties.\nNotably, in the inertial regime, deformation and velocity are seen to be\naltered prominently in the existence of significant charge convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 17:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In this study, we propose a quantitative\nmethod to derive historical shear deformations of rock fractures from digital\noutcrop models (DOMs) based on the analysis of effects of fault striations and\nfault steps on the shear strength parameter of the fracture surface. A\ntheoretical model that combines effects of fault striations, fault steps and\nisotropic base shear strength is fitted to the shear strength parameter. The\namount of fault striations and fault steps and their occurrences are estimated,\nand the historical shear deformations can be inferred. The validity and the\neffectiveness of the proposed method was proved by testing it on a constructed\nfracture surface with idealized striations and a fracture surface with clear\nfault steps. The application of this method on an example outcrop shows an\nintuitive idea of how the rock mass was deformed and that the distribution,\noccurrence and mode of new fractures are strictly controlled by preexisting\nfractures, and hence emphasizes the importance of preexisting fractures in\nmodeling the development of fracture systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 17:41:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 15:28:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 15:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Here we derive a simple\nanalytic solution for thermalization by calculating how electrons accumulate in\nthe ejecta and lose energy adiabatically and via plasma losses. We find that\nthe time-dependent thermalization efficiency is well described by $f(t) \\approx\n(1 + t/t_e)^{-n}$ where $n \\approx 1$ and the timescale $t_e$ is a function of\nthe ejecta mass and velocity.

Probably the best known example of a Bell\ninequality is due to Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH), which is defined\nin the simplest scenario involving two dichotomic measurements and whose all\nkey properties are well understood. There have been many attempts to generalise\nthe CHSH Bell inequality to higher-dimensional quantum systems, however, for\nmost of them the maximal quantum violation---the key quantity for most\ndevice-independent applications---remains unknown. On the other hand, the\nconstructions for which the maximal quantum violation can be computed, do not\npreserve the natural property of the CHSH inequality, namely, that the maximal\nquantum violation is achieved by the maximally entangled state and measurements\ncorresponding to mutually unbiased bases. In this work we propose a novel\nfamily of Bell inequalities which exhibit precisely these properties, and whose\nmaximal quantum violation can be computed analytically. In the simplest\nscenario it recovers the CHSH Bell inequality. These inequalities involve $d$\nmeasurements settings, each having $d$ outcomes for an arbitrary prime number\n$d\\geq 3$. We then show that in the three-outcome case our Bell inequality can\nbe used to self-test the maximally entangled state of two-qutrits and three\nmutually unbiased bases at each site. Yet, we demonstrate that in the case of\nmore outcomes, their maximal violation does not allow for self-testing in the\nstandard sense, which motivates the definition of a new weak form of\nself-testing.

In such systems, the ultimate goal of any request is to compute a\nsequence of functions in the network, where each function can be computed at\nonly a specific subset of network nodes. In conventional approaches, for each\nfunction, we choose one node from the corresponding subset of the nodes to\ncompute that function. In contrast, in this work, we allow each function to be\ncomputed in more than one node, redundantly in parallel, to respond to a given\nrequest. We argue that such redundancy in computation not only improves the\nreliability of the network, but would also, perhaps surprisingly, reduce the\noverall transmission delay. In particular, we establish that by judiciously\nchoosing the subset of nodes which compute each function, in conjunction with a\nlinear network coding scheme to deliver the result of each computation, we can\ncharacterize and achieve the optimal end-to-end transmission delay. In\naddition, we show that using such technique, we can significantly reduce the\ntransmission delay as compared to the conventional approach. In some scenarios,\nsuch reduction can even scale with the size of the network. More precisely, by\nincreasing the number of nodes that can compute the given function in parallel\nby a multiplicative factor, the end-to-end delay will also decrease by the same\nfactor. Moreover, we show that while finding the subset of nodes for each\ncomputation, in general, is a complex integer program, approximation algorithms\ncan be proposed to reduce the computational complexity.

In\ncombination with appropriate counterterms for the masses, couplings and\nwave-function normalization, these can be used to calculate radiative\ncorrections to the soliton solutions and transition rates that fully account\nfor the inhomogeneous background provided by the nucleated bubble. We apply\nthis approach to the archetypal example of transitions between the\nquasi-degenerate vacua of a massive scalar field with a quartic\nself-interaction. The effect of fermion loops is compared with those from\nadditional scalar fields, and the loop effects accounting for the spacetime\ninhomogeneity of the tunneling configuration are compared with those where\ngradients are neglected. We find that scalar loops lead to an enhancement of\nthe decay rate, whereas fermion loops lead to a suppression. These effects get\nrelatively amplified by a perturbatively small factor when gradients are\naccounted for. In addition, we observe that the radiative corrections to the\nsolitonic field profiles are smoother when the gradients are included. The\nmethod presented here for computing fermionic radiative corrections should be\napplicable beyond the archetypal example of vacuum decay. In particular, we\nwork out methods that are suitable for calculations in the thin-wall limit, as\nwell as others that take account of the full spherical symmetry of the\nsolution. For the latter case, we construct the Green's functions based on spin\nhyperspherical harmonics, which are eigenfunctions of the appropriate angular\nmomentum operators that commute with the Dirac operator in the solitonic\nbackground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 18:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 16:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

This work describes a method to infer voxel-level\ntransformation from higher-level correspondence information contained in\nanatomical labels. We argue that such labels are more reliable and practical to\nobtain for reference sets of image pairs than voxel-level correspondence.\nTypical anatomical labels of interest may include solid organs, vessels, ducts,\nstructure boundaries and other subject-specific ad hoc landmarks. The proposed\nend-to-end convolutional neural network approach aims to predict displacement\nfields to align multiple labelled corresponding structures for individual image\npairs during the training, while only unlabelled image pairs are used as the\nnetwork input for inference. We highlight the versatility of the proposed\nstrategy, for training, utilising diverse types of anatomical labels, which\nneed not to be identifiable over all training image pairs. At inference, the\nresulting 3D deformable image registration algorithm runs in real-time and is\nfully-automated without requiring any anatomical labels or initialisation.\nSeveral network architecture variants are compared for registering T2-weighted\nmagnetic resonance images and 3D transrectal ultrasound images from prostate\ncancer patients.

Under some conditions, one\ncan use existing methods from the SDR literature to estimate the directions\nassuming an idealized complete data structure, which subsequently yields an\nobvious extension to clinical trial datasets. In addition, we generalize the\ndirection idea to a nonlinear setting that exploits support vector machines.\nThe methodology is illustrated with application to a series of colorectal\ncancer clinical trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 20:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Quenching is linked with environment and stellar mass, and\nmuch of the current observational evidence comes from the integrated properties\nof galaxies. However, the relative size of the stellar and star-forming disk is\nsensitive to environmental processing and can help identify the mechanisms that\nlead to a large fraction of quenched galaxies in dense environments. Toward\nthis end, we measure the size of the star-forming disks for 224 galaxies in\nnine groups and clusters (0.02<z<0.04; SFR > 0.1 M$_\\odot$/yr) using 24um\nimaging from the Spitzer Space Telescope.

In this work a theory of the\napproximate control of complex network systems is proposed and developed by the\nuse of graphon theory and the theory of infinite dimensional systems. First,\ngraphon dynamical system models are formulated in an appropriate infinite\ndimensional space in order to represent arbitrary-size networks of linear\ndynamical systems, and to define the convergence of sequences of network\nsystems with limits in the space. Exact controllability and approximate\ncontrollability of graphon dynamical systems are then investigated. Second, the\nminimum energy state-to-state control problem and the linear quadratic\nregulator problem for systems on complex networks are considered. The control\nproblem for graphon limit systems is solved in each case and approximations are\ndefined which yield control laws for the original control problems.\nFurthermore, convergence properties of the approximation schemes are\nestablished. A systematic control design methodology is developed within this\nframework. Finally, numerical examples of networks with randomly sampled\nweightings are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the graphon control\nmethodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 22:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 21:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 05:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 13:42:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 18:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Interestingly, with the normal fluid, we find that there\nexists friction between the normal-fluid and superfluid currents. Due to this\nfriction, part of the superfluid becomes viscous. Therefore, a three-fluid\nmodel: normal fluid, non-viscous and viscous superfluids, is proposed. For the\nstationary magnetic response, at $v_s<v_L$ with only the non-viscous\nsuperfluid, the Meissner supercurrent is excited and the gap equation can\nreduce to Ginzburg-Landau equation. At $v_s{\\ge}v_L$, with the normal fluid,\nnon-viscous and viscous superfluids, in addition to the directly excited\nMeissner supercurrent in the superfluid, normal-fluid current is also induced\nthrough the friction drag with the viscous superfluid current.

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved\ninteresting results in LIC by learning an encoder-quantizer-decoder network\nfrom a large amount of data. However, existing CNN-based LIC methods usually\ncan only train a network for a specific bits-per-pixel (bpp).

In this paper, we propose to learn a single CNN\nwhich can perform LIC at multiple bpp rates. A simple yet effective Tucker\nDecomposition Network (TDNet) is developed, where there is a novel tucker\ndecomposition layer (TDL) to decompose a latent image representation into a set\nof projection matrices and a core tensor. By changing the rank of the core\ntensor and its quantization, we can easily adjust the bpp rate of latent image\nrepresentation within a single CNN. Furthermore, an iterative non-uniform\nquantization scheme is presented to optimize the quantizer, and a\ncoarse-to-fine training strategy is introduced to reconstruct the decompressed\nimages.

There are several equivalent\ndefinitions of graph reassembling; in this report we use a definition which\nmakes it closest to the notion of graph carving. A reassembling is a rooted\nbinary tree whose nodes are subsets of V and whose leaf nodes are singleton\nsets, with each of the latter containing a distinct vertex of G. The parent of\ntwo nodes in the reassembling is the union of the two children's vertex sets.\nThe root node of the reassembling is the full set V. The edge-boundary degree\nof a node in the reassembling is the number of edges in G that connect vertices\nin the node's set to vertices not in the node's set. A reassembling's\nalpha-measure is the largest edge-boundary degree of any node in the\nreassembling. A reassembling of G is alpha-optimal if its alpha-measure is the\nminimum among all alpha-measures of G's reassemblings.\n  The problem of finding an alpha-optimal reassembling of a simple graph in\ngeneral was already shown to be NP-hard.\n  In this report we present an algorithm which, given a 3-regular plane graph G\n= (V,E) as input, returns a reassembling of G with an alpha-measure independent\nof n (number of vertices in G) and upper-bounded by 2k, where k is the\nedge-outerplanarity of G.

They serve as\nhigh-performance transducers, sensors, and filters by offering low dissipation,\ntunable coupling to diverse physical systems, and compatibility with a wide\nrange of frequencies, materials, and fabrication processes. Systems of phononic\nresonators typically obey reciprocity, which ensures that the phonon\ntransmission coefficient between any two resonators is independent of the\ndirection of transmission. Reciprocity must be broken to realize devices (such\nas isolators and circulators) that provide one-way propagation of acoustic\nenergy between resonators. Such devices are crucial for protecting active\nelements, mitigating noise, and operating full-duplex transceivers. To date,\nnonreciprocal phononic devices have not combined the features necessary for\nrobust operation: strong nonreciprocity, in situ tunability, compact\nintegration, and continuous operation. Furthermore, they have been applied only\nto coherent signals (rather than fluctuations or noise), and have been realized\nexclusively in travelling-wave systems (rather than resonators). Here we\ndescribe a cavity optomechanical scheme that produces robust nonreciprocal\ncoupling between phononic resonators. This scheme provides ~ 30 dB of isolation\nand can be tuned in situ simply via the phases of the drive tones applied to\nthe cavity. In addition, by directly monitoring the resonators' dynamics we\nshow that this nonreciprocity can be used to control thermal fluctuations, and\nthat this control represents a new resource for cooling phononic resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 05:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

To cope with the\nchallenges in the comprehensive transcription of HINs, we propose the HEER\nalgorithm, which embeds HINs via edge representations that are further coupled\nwith properly-learned heterogeneous metrics. To corroborate the efficacy of\nHEER, we conducted experiments on two large-scale real-words datasets with an\nedge reconstruction task and multiple case studies. Experiment results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HEER model and the utility of\nedge representations and heterogeneous metrics. The code and data are available\nat https://github.com/GentleZhu/HEER.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 06:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Three key\nconditions for unique solvability and stability are introduced: a connectivity\ncondition with respect to particle distribution and smoothing length, a\nregularity condition for particle distribution, and a time step condition. The\nunique solvability of both the implicit and semi-implicit schemes in two- and\nthree-dimensional spaces is established with the connectivity condition.

However, the severe nonlinearity and\nnon-convexity make the related optimization problem mathematically difficult to\nsolve, especially when the transmit power or the path-loss exponent (PLE) is\nunknown. Moreover, even if the PLE is known but not perfectly estimated or the\nanchor location information is not accurate, the constructed data model will\nbecome uncertain, making the problem again hard to solve. This paper\nparticularly focuses on differential received signal strength (DRSS)-based\nlocalization with model uncertainties in case of unknown transmit power and\nPLE. A new whitened model for DRSS-based localization with unknown transmit\npowers is first presented and investigated. When assuming the PLE is known, we\nintroduce two estimators based on an exact data model, an advanced best linear\nunbiased estimator (A-BLUE) and a Lagrangian estimator (LE), and then we\npresent a robust semidefinite programming (SDP)-based estimator (RSDPE), which\ncan cope with model uncertainties (imperfect PLE and inaccurate anchor location\ninformation). The three proposed estimators have their own advantages from\ndifferent perspectives: the A-BLUE has the lowest complexity; the LE holds the\nbest accuracy for a small measurement noise; and the RSDPE yields the best\nperformance under a large measurement noise and possesses a very good\nrobustness against model uncertainties. Finally, we propose a robust SDP-based\nblock coordinate descent estimator (RSDP-BCDE) to deal with a completely\nunknown PLE and its performance converges to that of the RSDPE using a\nperfectly known PLE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 08:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Such research is motivated by the desire to substantially\ncut down the hardware cost and power consumption of the radio-frequency chain,\nwhich is unaffordable in massive MIMO if high-resolution DACs are still used.\nOne-bit MIMO precoding design problems are much harder to solve than their\nhigh-resolution DAC counterparts. In our previous work, we developed a minimum\nsymbol-error probability (SEP) design for one-bit precoding under the multiuser\nMISO downlink scenario and under quadrature amplitude modulation signaling.\nLeveraging on the previous work, this work shows how the minimum SEP design is\napplied to M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) signaling. Simulation results show\nthat our minimum SEP design delivers significantly better bit-error rate (BER)\nperformance than the other designs for higher-order PSK such as 8-PSK and\n16-PSK. As a minor, but useful, side contribution, we also tackle an MPSK SEP\ncharacterization problem which was only intuitively treated in the prior arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 09:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 13:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

In most of these and earlier works the atomic level stress is the\nminimal element of stress. It is also possible to consider, for pairwise\ninteraction potentials, as the minimal elements of stress, the stress tensors\nassociated with the pairs of interacting particles. From this perspective, the\natomic level stress is not the minimal stress element, but a sum of all pair\nstress elements in which involved a selected particle. In this paper, we\nconsider the Green-Kubo stress correlation function from a microscopic\nperspective using the stress tensors of interacting pairs as the basic stress\nelements. The obtained results show the presence of a long-range\nbond-orientational order in the studied model liquid and naturally elucidate\nthe connection of the bond-orientational order with viscosity. It turns out\nthat the long-range bond-orientational order is more clearly expressed in the\npairs' stress correlation function than in the atomic stress correlation\nfunction. On the other hand, previously observed stress waves are much better\nexpressed in the atomic stress correlation functions. We also address the close\nconnection of our approach with the previous bond-orientational order\nconsiderations. Finally, we consider the probability distributions for the\nbond-stress and atomic stress correlation products at selected distances.

Although when\ncreating the original KNS the intention of the authors was to develop such a\nsmoothing method that preserves the marginal distributions of the original\nmodel, this property was not maintained when developing the MKNS.\n  In this article I would like to overcome this and propose such a refined\nversion of the MKNS that preserves these marginal distributions while keeping\nthe advantages of both previous versions. Beside its advantageous properties,\nthis novel smoothing method is shown to achieve about the same results as the\nMKNS in a standard language modelling task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 12:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

On the one hand, a-contrario\nstrategies avoid the user involvement for tuning detection thresholds, and\nallow one to account fairly for different pattern sizes. On the other hand,\na-contrario criteria become intractable when the pattern complexity in terms of\nparametrization increases. In this work, we introduce a strategy which relies\non the use of a cumulative space of reduced dimensionality, derived from the\ncoupling of a classic (Hough) cumulative space with an integral histogram\ntrick. This space allows us to store partial computations which are required by\nthe a-contrario criterion, and to evaluate the significance with a lower\ncomputational cost than by following a straightforward approach. The method is\nillustrated on synthetic examples on patterns with various parametrizations up\nto five dimensions. In order to demonstrate how to apply this generic concept\nin a real scenario, we consider a difficult crack detection task in still\nimages, which has been addressed in the literature with various local and\nglobal detection strategies. We model cracks as bounded segments, detected by\nthe proposed a-contrario criterion, which allow us to introduce additional\nspatial constraints based on their relative alignment.

We use this statistical method to generate a\nmillion phonological variations of words from the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary\nand train a sequence-to-sequence RNN to recognize accented words with 59%\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 17:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

In this limit the so-called length-gauge transformation\nfor a fully quantized light-matter system gives rise to a dipole self-energy\nterm in the Hamiltonian, i.e., a harmonic potential of the total dipole matter\nmoment. In practice this term is often discarded as it is assumed to be\nsubsumed in the kinetic energy term. In this work we show the necessity of the\ndipole self-energy term. First and foremost, without it the light-matter system\nin the long-wavelength limit does not have a ground-state, i.e., the combined\nlight-matter system is unstable. Further, the mixing of matter and photon\ndegrees of freedom due to the length-gauge transformation, which also changes\nthe representation of the translation operator for matter, gives rise to the\nMaxwell equations in matter and the omittance of the dipole self-energy leads\nto a violation of these equations. Specifically we show that without the dipole\nself-energy the so-called 'depolarization shift' is not properly described.\nFinally we show that this term also arises if we perform the semi-classical\nlimit after the length-gauge transformation. In contrast to the standard\napproach where the semi-classical limit is performed before the length-gauge\ntransformation, the resulting Hamiltonian is bounded from below and thus\nsupports ground-states. This is very important for practical calculations and\nfor density-functional variational implementations of the non-relativistic QED\nformalism. For example, the existence of a combined light-matter ground-state\nallows one to calculate the Stark shift non-perturbatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 13:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

As they do not naturally belong to a Hilbert space, standard statistical\nmethods cannot be directly applied to them. Instead, feature maps (or\nrepresentations) are commonly used for the analysis. A large class of feature\nmaps, which we call linear, depends on some weight functions, the choice of\nwhich is a critical issue. An important criterion to choose a weight function\nis to ensure stability of the feature maps with respect to Wasserstein\ndistances on diagrams. We improve known results on the stability of such maps,\nand extend it to general weight functions.

A crucial and\nlong-standing question in this context is whether quarks are deconfined as a\nresult of the dramatic increase in density and temperature following the\nmerger. We present the first fully general-relativistic simulations of merging\nneutron stars including quarks at finite temperatures that can be switched off\nconsistently in the equation of state. Within our approach, we can determine\nclearly what signatures a quark-hadron phase transition would leave in the\ngravitational-wave signal. In particular, we show that if the conditions are\nmet for a phase transition to take place at several times nuclear saturation\ndensity, they would lead to a post-merger signal considerably different from\nthe one expected from the inspiral, that can only probe the hadronic part of\nthe equations of state, and to an anticipated collapse of the merged object. We\nalso show that the phase transition leads to a very hot and dense quark core\nthat, when it collapses to a black hole, produces a ringdown signal different\nfrom the hadronic one. Finally, in analogy with what is done in heavy-ion\ncollisions, we use the evolution of the temperature and density in the merger\nremnant to illustrate the properties of the phase transition in a QCD phase\ndiagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 14:46:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 05:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Patients with IGE have significant bilateral\nalterations in major white-matter fascicles. In the cingulum, fornix, and\nsuperior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised, whereas in\nspecific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus, tract\nintegrity is enhanced in patients. Combining these alterations in a logistic\nregression model, we computed the decision boundary that discriminated patients\nand controls. The computational model, informed with the findings on the tract\nabnormalities, specifically highlighted the importance of enhanced\ncortico-reticular connections along with impaired cortico-cortical connections\nin inducing pathological seizure-like dynamics. We emphasise taking\ndirectionality of brain connectivity into consideration towards understanding\nthe pathological mechanisms; this is possible by combining neuroimaging and\ncomputational modelling. Our imaging evidence of structural alterations suggest\nthe loss of cortico-cortical and enhancement of cortico-thalamic fibre\nintegrity in IGE. We further suggest that impaired connectivity from cortical\nregions to the thalamic reticular nucleus offers a therapeutic target for\nselectively modifying the brain circuit for reversing the mechanisms leading to\nepileptogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 15:11:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2018 09:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

These two domains have traditionally remained\nmostly disjoint, with cooperative threading used for increasing throughput in\ncompute-intensive applications such as scientific workloads and cooperative\nthreading used for increasing responsiveness in interactive applications such\nas GUIs and games. As multicore hardware becomes increasingly mainstream, there\nis a need for bridging these two disjoint worlds, because many applications mix\ninteraction and computation and would benefit from both cooperative and\ncompetitive threading.\n  In this paper, we present techniques for programming and reasoning about\nparallel interactive applications that can use both cooperative and competitive\nthreading. Our techniques enable the programmer to write rich parallel\ninteractive programs by creating and synchronizing with threads as needed, and\nby assigning threads user-defined and partially ordered priorities. To ensure\nimportant responsiveness properties, we present a modal type system analogous\nto S4 modal logic that precludes low-priority threads from delaying\nhigh-priority threads, thereby statically preventing a crucial set of\npriority-inversion bugs. We then present a cost model that allows reasoning\nabout responsiveness and completion time of well-typed programs. The cost model\nextends the traditional work-span model for cooperative threading to account\nfor competitive scheduling decisions needed to ensure responsiveness. Finally,\nwe show that our proposed techniques are realistic by implementing them as an\nextension to the Standard ML language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 15:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Nonetheless, observations\nindicate the presence of cold water vapor, implying that non-thermal desorption\nmechanisms are at play.

An effective collective response requires suitable\ninformation transfer among agents, and thus is critically dependent on the\nagents' interaction network. In order to investigate the influence of the\nnetwork topology on collective response, we consider an archetypal model of\ndistributed decision-making---the leader-follower linear consensus---and study\nthe collective capacity of the system to follow a dynamic driving signal (the\n\"leader\") for a range of topologies and system sizes. The analysis reveals a\nnontrivial relationship between optimal topology and frequency of the driving\nsignal. Interestingly, the response is optimal when each individual interacts\nwith a certain number of agents which decreases monotonically with the\nfrequency and, for large enough systems, is independent of the size of the\nsystem. This phenomenology is investigated in experiments of collective motion\nusing a swarm of land robots. The emergent collective response to both a slow-\nand a fast-changing leader is measured and analyzed for a range of interaction\ntopologies.

In this paper, we develop a surrogate-based\nBayesian inversion framework that explicitly quantifies and gradually reduces\nthe approximation error of the surrogate. Specifically, two strategies are\nproposed to quantify the surrogate error. The first strategy works by\nquantifying the surrogate prediction uncertainty with a Bayesian method, while\nthe second strategy uses another surrogate to simulate and correct the\napproximation error of the primary surrogate. By adaptively refining the\nsurrogate over the posterior distribution, we can gradually reduce the\nsurrogate approximation error to a small level. Demonstrated with three case\nstudies involving high dimensionality, multimodality, and a real-world\napplication, it is found that both strategies can reduce the bias introduced by\nsurrogate approximation error, while the second strategy that integrates two\nmethods (i.e., polynomial chaos expansion and Gaussian process in this work)\nthat complement each other shows the best performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 03:07:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2018 09:02:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 02:56:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 02:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

We are using a\nnovel approach for segmentation and neural network based regression model for\nachieving better results for the task of estimating sheep weight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 16:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

Our approach to the problem is a reinterpretation of the Helmholtz Free\nEnergy formula from physics to explain the relationship between content and\nnoise when using sensors (such as cameras or microphones) to capture multimedia\ndata. The reinterpretation allows a bit-measurement of the noise contained in\nimages, audio, and video by combining a classifier with perceptual compression,\nsuch as JPEG or MP3. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 as well as Fraunhofer's\nIDMT-SMT-Audio-Effects dataset indicate that, at the right quality level,\nperceptual compression is actually not harmful but contributes to a significant\nreduction of complexity of the machine learning process. That is, our noise\nquantification method can be used to speed up the training of deep learning\nclassifiers significantly while maintaining, or sometimes even improving,\noverall classification accuracy. Moreover, our results provide insights into\nthe reasons for the success of deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 01:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

These features can be used as basic building blocks for\nexecuting collaborative business processes between mutually untrusting parties.\nHowever, implementing business processes using the low-level primitives\nprovided by blockchain platforms is cumbersome and error-prone. In contrast,\nestablished business process management systems, such as those based on the\nstandard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide convenient\nabstractions for rapid development of process-oriented applications. This\narticle demonstrates how to combine the advantages of a business process\nmanagement system with those of a blockchain platform. The article introduces a\nblockchain-based BPMN execution engine, namely Caterpillar. Like any BPMN\nexecution engine, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process\nmodel and allows users to monitor the state of process instances and to execute\ntasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process\ninstance is maintained on the (Ethereum) blockchain and the workflow routing is\nperformed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The\nCaterpillar compiler supports a large array of BPMN constructs, including\nsubprocesses, multi-instances activities and event handlers. The paper\ndescribes the architecture of Caterpillar, and the interfaces it provides to\nsupport the monitoring of process instances, the allocation and execution of\nwork items, and the execution of service tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 04:30:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 01:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 08:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}
