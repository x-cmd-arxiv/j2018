It is\nnecessary to increase the sample of molecular clouds, located at different\ndistances, in which the behavior of molecular abundance ratios, such as the\n13CO/C18O ratio (X), is studied in detail. We selected the well-studied\nhigh-mass star-forming region G29.96-0.02, located at a distance of about 6.2\nkpc, which is an ideal laboratory to perform this kind of studies. To study the\nX towards this region it was used 12CO J=3-2 data obtained from COHRS, 13CO and\nC18O J=3-2 data from CHIMPS, and 13CO and C18O J=2-1 data retrieved from the\nCDS database (observed with the IRAM 30m telescope). The distribution of column\ndensities and X throughout the molecular cloud was studied based on LTE and\nnon-LTE methods. Values of X between 1.5 to 10.5, with an average of 5, were\nfound, showing that, besides the dependency between X and the galactocentric\ndistance, the local physical conditions may strongly affect this abundance\nratio. We found that correlating the X map with the location of the ionized gas\nand dark clouds allows us to suggest in which regions the far-UV radiation\nstalls in dense gaseous components, and in which ones it escapes and\nselectively photodissociates the C18O isotope. The non-LTE analysis shows that\nthe molecular gas has very different physical conditions, not only spatially\nacross the cloud, but also along the line of sight. This kind of studies may\nrepresent a tool to indirectly estimate (from molecular lines observations) the\ndegree of photodissociation in molecular clouds, which is indeed useful to\nstudy the chemistry in the interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 16:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling.\nWhile most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a\nparticular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful\nrepresentations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech,\nimages, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 16:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 18:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

This property makes it difficult to compare attention to other alignment\napproaches, to compose it with probabilistic models, and to perform posterior\ninference conditioned on observed data. A related latent approach, hard\nattention, fixes these issues, but is generally harder to train and less\naccurate. This work considers variational attention networks, alternatives to\nsoft and hard attention for learning latent variable alignment models, with\ntighter approximation bounds based on amortized variational inference. We\nfurther propose methods for reducing the variance of gradients to make these\napproaches computationally feasible. Experiments show that for machine\ntranslation and visual question answering, inefficient exact latent variable\nmodels outperform standard neural attention, but these gains go away when using\nhard attention based training.

The natural stratification\nof the varieties, the identification of strata with twists, and the action of\nLorentz and $R$-symmetry on the varieties are emphasized. We also include a\nshort and unconventional exposition of the pure-spinor superfield formalism,\nfrom the perspective of twisting, and demonstrate that it can be applied to\nconstruct familiar multiplets in four-dimensional minimally supersymmetric\ntheories; in all dimensions and with any amount of supersymmetry, this\ntechnique produces BRST or BV complexes of supersymmetric theories from the\nKoszul complex of the cone point over the coordinate ring of the nilpotence\nvariety, possibly tensored with a module over that coordinate ring. In\naddition, we remark on a natural emergence of nilpotence varieties in the\nChevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of supertranslations, and give two applications\nrelated to these ideas: a calculation of Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology for the\nsix-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ supertranslation algebra, and a BV complex\nmatching the field content of type IIB supergravity from the coordinate ring of\nthe corresponding nilpotence variety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 17:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-11"}

Using a sample of open clusters stars, we wish to address two issues:\nminimize chemical abundance differences which origin is linked to the\nevolutionary stage of the stars and not their original composition; evaluate a\nphylogenetic approach to group stars based on their chemical composition.\n  Methods. We derived differential chemical abundances for 207 stars (belonging\nto 34 open clusters) using the Sun as reference star (classical approach) and a\ndwarf plus a giant star from the open cluster M67 as reference (new approach).\nThese abundances were then used to perform two phylogenetic analyses,\ncladistics (Maximum Parsimony) and Neighbour-Joining, together with a\npartitioning unsupervised classification analysis with k-means. The resulting\ngroupings were finally confronted to the true open cluster memberships of the\nstars.\n  Results. We successfully reconstruct most of the original open clusters when\ncarefully selecting a subset of the abundances derived differentially with\nrespect to M67. We find a set of eight chemical elements that yields the best\nresult, and discuss the possible reasons for them to be good tracers of the\nhistory of the Galaxy.\n  Conclusions. Our study shows that unraveling the history of the Galaxy by\nonly using stellar chemical abundances is greatly improved provided that i) we\nperform a differential spectroscopic analysis with respect to an open cluster\ninstead of the Sun, ii) select the chemical elements that are good tracers of\nthe history of the Galaxy, and iii) use tools that are adapted to detect\nevolutionary tracks such as phylogenetic approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

As evolution proceeds during\nthe WD cooling phase, a crystallization process resulting from Coulomb\ninteractions in very dense plasmas is expected to occur, leading to the\nformation of a highly crystallized core. Pulsating ultra-massive WDs offer a\nunique opportunity to infer and test the occurrence of crystallization in WD\ninteriors as well as physical processes related with dense plasmas. We aim to\nassess the adiabatic pulsation properties of ultra-massive DA WD with ONe\ncores. We studied the pulsation properties of ultra-massive DA WD stars with\nONe cores. We employed a new set of ultra-massive WD evolutionary sequences of\nmodels with stellar masses in the range 1.10 $\\leq M_{star}/M_{sun} \\leq$ 1.29\ncomputed by taking into account the complete evolution of the progenitor stars\nand the WD stage. When crystallization set on in our models, we took into\naccount latent heat release and also the expected changes in the core chemical\ncomposition that are due to phase separation according to a phase diagram\nsuitable for O and Ne plasmas. We computed nonradial pulsation g-modes of our\nsequences of models at the ZZ Ceti phase by taking into account a solid core.\nWe explored the impact of crystallization on their pulsation properties, in\nparticular, the structure of the period spectrum and the distribution of the\nperiod spacings. We find that it would be possible, in principle, to discern\nwhether a WD has a nucleus made of CO or a nucleus of ONe by studying the\nspacing between periods. The features found in the period-spacing diagrams\ncould be used as a seismological tool to discern the core composition of\nultra-massive ZZ Ceti stars, something that should be complemented with\ndetailed asteroseismic analysis using the individual observed periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 18:21:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently\nbeen shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as\nmachine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process\nall inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training\ntimes. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models\nlike the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent\nmodels handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference\nwhen the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We\npropose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive\nrecurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the\nTransformer model and which addresses these issues.

It is thus a stepping stone to\nunderstand the complex formation processes of stars in starburst regions across\nthe Universe. Here, we have studied the formation history of massive stars in\n30 Dor using masses and ages derived for 452 mainly OB stars from the\nspectroscopic VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS). We find that stars of all\nages and masses are scattered throughout 30 Dor. This is remarkable because it\nimplies that massive stars either moved large distances or formed independently\nover the whole field of view in relative isolation. We find that both channels\ncontribute to the 30 Dor massive star population. Massive star formation\nrapidly accelerated about 8 Myr ago, first forming stars in the field before\ngiving birth to the stellar populations in NGC 2060 and NGC 2070. The R136 star\ncluster in NGC 2070 formed last and, since then, about 1 Myr ago, star\nformation seems to be diminished with some continuing in the surroundings of\nR136. Massive stars within a projected distance of 8 pc of R136 are not coeval\nbut show an age range of up to 6 Myr. Our mass distributions are well populated\nup to $200\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.

To debug\nsuch interaction faults, it is necessary to understand the individual effect of\nthe input, how these inputs interact and how these interactions cause the\nfault. The differences between two execution traces can explain why one input\nbehaves differently than the other. We propose to compare execution traces of\nall input options to derive explanations of the behavior of all options and\ninteractions among them. To make the relevant information stand out, we\nrepresent them as variational traces that concisely represents control-flow and\ndata-flow differences among multiple concrete traces.

In this work, we exhaustively investigate the ground state properties\nand the low-lying energy spectrum of two linearly coupled Bose-Hubbard rings.\nWe show that the competition among interactions, intra- and inter-ring hopping\nprocesses gives place to a rather rich physical scenario, where Mott-like\nstates and (different kinds of) superfluid-like states emerge. The latter ones\ndepend also on the (in)commensurate filling of the atoms. Our analysis, carried\nout within a simple analytical framework and by means of the exact numerical\ndiagonalization of the system Hamiltonian, provides one with a rather complete\ncharacterization of the static properties of the two-ring ladder, including,\nbut not limited to, coherence, fragmentation, correlations, and entanglement.\nWe complement our investigation by studying how these indicators depend on the\ncommensurability of the total number of bosons with respect to the total number\nof sites and show that the two stacked rings are always entangled for an odd\nnumber of atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 19:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 May 2021 10:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

When a client arrives, then it has\nto be assigned either to an existing facility or to a new facility opened at\nthe client's location. However, when a client who has been also one of the open\nfacilities is to be removed, then our model has to allow to reconnect all\nclients that have been connected to that removed facility. In this model, we\npresent an optimal O(log n_act / log log n_act)-competitive algorithm, where\nn_act is the number of active clients at the end of the input sequence.\n  Next, we turn our attention to the capacitated Facility Location problem. We\nfirst note that if no deletions are allowed, then one can achieve an optimal\ncompetitive ratio of O(log n/ log log n), where n is the length of the\nsequence. However, when deletions are allowed, the capacitated version of the\nproblem is significantly more challenging than the uncapacitated one.

The\ntypical dynamical evolution can be separated in two main regimes: I) Slow\nmigration ($T_{\\rm mig}$ $\\sim$ $10^{3-4}\\times T_{\\rm orb}$), where viscous\ntorques are not efficient enough to redistribute the extracted angular momentum\nfrom the binary, leading to the formation of a low density cavity around the\nbinary. II) Fast migration ($T_{\\rm mig}$ $\\sim$ $10^{1-2} \\times T_{\\rm\norb}$), in which the redistribution of angular momentum is efficient and no low\ndensity cavity is formed in the circumbinary disc. Using N-Body/SPH simulations\nwe study the effect of AGN feedback in this phase of a SMBHB evolution.

To fully understand driving volatility with the intention of reducing\nit, the objective of this study is to identify its key correlates, while\nfocusing on highly volatile trips. First, a measure of driving volatility based\non vehicle speed is applied to trip data collected in the California Household\nTravel Survey during 2012-2013. Specifically, the trips containing driving\ncycles (N=62839 trips) were analyzed to obtain driving volatility. Second,\ncorrelations of volatility with the trip, vehicle, and person level variables\nwere quantified using Ordinary Least Squares and quantile regression models.\nThe results of the 90th percentile regression (which distinguishes the 10%\nhighly volatile trips from the rest) show that trips taken by pickup trucks,\nhatchbacks, convertibles, and minivans are less volatile when compared to the\ntrips taken by sedans. Moreover, longer trips have less driving volatility. In\naddition, younger drivers are more volatile drivers than old ones. Overall, the\nresults of this study are reasonable and beneficial in identifying correlates\nof driving volatility, especially in terms of understanding factors that\ndifferentiate highly volatile trips from other trips. Reductions in driving\nvolatility have positive implications for transportation safety. From a\nmethodological standpoint, this study is an example of how to extract useful\n(volatility) information from raw vehicle speed data and use it to calm down\ndrivers and ultimately improve transportation safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 20:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

In this paper, we develop a novel attention-based\ndeep learning architecture, DeepDiff, that provides a unified and end-to-end\nsolution to model and to interpret how dependencies among histone modifications\ncontrol the differential patterns of gene regulation. DeepDiff uses a hierarchy\nof multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the spatial\nstructure of input signals and to model how various histone modifications\ncooperate automatically. We introduce and train two levels of attention jointly\nwith the target prediction, enabling DeepDiff to attend differentially to\nrelevant modifications and to locate important genome positions for each\nmodification. Additionally, DeepDiff introduces a novel deep-learning based\nmulti-task formulation to use the cell-type-specific gene expression\npredictions as auxiliary tasks, encouraging richer feature embeddings in our\nprimary task of differential expression prediction. Using data from Roadmap\nEpigenomics Project (REMC) for ten different pairs of cell types, we show that\nDeepDiff significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for\ndifferential gene expression prediction.

In this study,\nthe response of the lymphangions to dynamically varying wall shear stress is\ncharacterized in isolated rat thoracic ducts in relation to their shear\nsensitivity. The critical shear stress above which the thoracic duct shows\nsubstantial inhibition of contraction was found to be significantly negatively\ncorrelated to the diameter of the lymphangion.

Here, we present new ultra-massive white dwarf\nevolutionary sequences that constitute an improvement over previous ones. In\nthese new sequences, we take into account for the first time the process of\nphase separation expected during the crystallization stage of these white\ndwarfs, by relying on the most up-to-date phase diagram of dense oxygen/neon\nmixtures. Realistic chemical profiles resulting from the full computation of\nprogenitor evolution during the semidegenerate carbon burning along the\nsuper-AGB phase are also considered in our sequences.

The auto-encoding variational Bayes method (VAEs) was proposed in 2013,\nwhich uses variational inference to learn a latent space from the image\ndatabase and then generates images using the decoder. The generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) came out as a promising framework, which uses\nadversarial training to improve the generative ability of the generator.\nHowever, the generated pictures by GANs are generally blurry. The deep\nconvolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) were then proposed to\nleverage the quality of generated images. Since the input noise vectors are\nrandomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution, the generator has to map from a\nwhole normal distribution to the images. This makes DCGANs unable to reflect\nthe inherent structure of the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndeep model, called generative adversarial networks with decoder-encoder output\nnoise (DE-GANs), which takes advantage of both the adversarial training and the\nvariational Bayesain inference to improve the performance of image generation.\nDE-GANs use a pre-trained decoder-encoder architecture to map the random\nGaussian noise vectors to informative ones and pass them to the generator of\nthe adversarial networks. Since the decoder-encoder architecture is trained by\nthe same images as the generators, the output vectors could carry the intrinsic\ndistribution information of the original images. Moreover, the loss function of\nDE-GANs is different from GANs and DCGANs. A hidden-space loss function is\nadded to the adversarial loss function to enhance the robustness of the model.\nExtensive empirical results show that DE-GANs can accelerate the convergence of\nthe adversarial training process and improve the quality of the generated\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 01:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

Moreover, there are\nnot many representational models for the majority of autonomous systems, as it\nis not easy to build a compact model that captures the entire dynamical\nsubtleties and uncertainties. In this work, we present a hierarchical Bayesian\nlinear regression model with local features to learn the dynamics of a\nmicro-robotic system as well as two simpler examples, consisting of a\nstochastic mass-spring damper and a stochastic double inverted pendulum on a\ncart. The model is hierarchical since we assume non-stationary priors for the\nmodel parameters. These non-stationary priors make the model more flexible by\nimposing priors on the priors of the model. To solve the maximum likelihood\n(ML) problem for this hierarchical model, we use the variational expectation\nmaximization (EM) algorithm, and enhance the procedure by introducing hidden\ntarget variables. The algorithm yields parsimonious model structures, and\nconsistently provides fast and accurate predictions for all our examples\ninvolving large training and test sets.

The solutions exist for all $D$, but\nthey can be expressed as polynomial functions in $r$ only when $D$ is even. We\ngive conditions for the mass $M$ and the scalar charge $\\eta$ in the extremal\ncase. We also investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black holes in\ncanonical ensemble. The monopole alter the stability differently in each\ndimensions. As the charge increases the black hole radiates more, in contrast\nto its counterpart with ordinary global defects where the Hawking temperature\nis minimum for critical $\\eta$. This behavior can also be observed for\nvariation of DBI coupling, $\\beta$. As it gets stronger ($\\beta\\ll1$) the\ntemperature increases. By studying the heat capacity we can infer that there is\nno phase transition in asymptotically-flat spacetime. The AdS black holes, on\nthe other hand, undergo a first-ordered phase transition in the Hawking-Page\ntype. The increase of the DBI coupling renders the phase transition happen for\nlarger radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 04:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

Based on this framework, the optimal spatial\nresolution and the corresponding minimum field-wide error level in the\ncalculated pressure field are determined. This minimum error can be viewed as\nthe smallest resolvable pressure. We find that the optimal spatial resolution\nis a function of the flow features (patterns and length scales), fundamental\nproperties of the flow domain (e.g., geometry of the flow domain and the type\nof the boundary conditions), in addition to the error in the PIV experiments,\nand the choice of numerical methods. Making a general statement about pressure\nsensitivity is difficult. The minimum resolvable pressure depends on competing\neffects from the experimental error due to PIV and the truncation error from\nthe numerical solver, which is affected by the formulation of the solver.

Here, we elucidate the sequence of precipitation on grain\nboundaries in comparison to the bulk in a model Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy. We\ninvestigate the material from the solution heat treated state\n(475{\\textdegree}C), through the very early stages of aging to the peak aged\nstate at 120{\\textdegree}C and further into the overaged regime at\n180{\\textdegree}C. The process starts with solute enrichment on grain\nboundaries due to equilibrium segregation accompanied by solute depletion in\ntheir vicinity, the formation of Guinier--Preston (GP) zones in the\nsolute-enriched grain boundary regions, and GP zones growth and transformation.\nThe equilibrium segregation of solutes to grain boundaries during aging\naccelerates this sequence compared to the bulk. Analysis of the ~10 nm wide\nprecipitate-free zones (PFZs) adjacent to the solute-enriched grain boundaries\n2 shows that the depletion zones are determined by (i) interface equilibrium\nsegregation; (ii) formation and coarsening of the grain boundary precipitates\nand (iii) the diffusion range of solutes in the matrix.

The reason is ascribed\nto the ability of the second dredge-up to significantly reduce the mass of the\nHe core and of the efficient AGB winds[...]. In this study, we investigate the\nformation of ECSN through case A and case B mass transfer. In these scenarios,\nwhen Roche lobe overflow stops, the primary has become a helium star. With a\nsmall envelope left, the second dredge-up is prevented, potentially opening new\npaths to ECSN. We compute binary models using our stellar evolution code\nBINSTAR. We consider three different secondary masses of 8, 9, and 10 $M_\\odot$\nand explore the parameter space, varying the companion mass, orbital period,\nand input physics. Assuming conservative mass transfer, with our choice of\nsecondary masses all case A systems enter contact either during the main\nsequence or as a consequence of reversed mass transfer when the secondary\novertakes its companion during core helium burning. Case B systems are able to\nproduce ECSN progenitors in a relatively small range of periods ($3\\le P(d)\\le\n30$) and primary masses ($10.9\\le M/M_\\odot\\le 11.5$). Changing the companion\nmass has little impact on the primary's fate as long as the mass ratio\n$M_1/M_2$ remains less than 1.4-1.5, above which evolution to contact becomes\nunavoidable. We also find that allowing for systemic mass loss substantially\nincreases the period interval over which ECSN can occur. This change in the\nbinary physics does not however affect the primary mass range. We finally\nstress that the formation of ECSN progenitors through case A and B mass\ntransfer is very sensitive to adopted binary and stellar physics. Close\nbinaries provide additional channels for ECSN but the parameter space is rather\nconstrained likely making ECSN a rare event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 09:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

As a side effect of our analysis, we obtain a test to verify\nwhether a given function is the proximity operator of some penalty, or not.\nMany well-known shrinkage operators are indeed confirmed to be proximity\noperators. However, we prove that windowed Group-LASSO and persistent empirical\nWiener shrinkage -- two forms of so-called social sparsity shrinkage-- are\ngenerally not the proximity operator of any penalty; the exception is when they\nare simply weighted versions of group-sparse shrinkage with non-overlapping\ngroups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 09:06:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 07:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:17:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 12:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

A first route relies on Bayesian modeling, where prior\nprobabilities are used to embody models of both the distribution of the unknown\nvariables and their statistical dependence with the observed data. The\nestimation process typically relies on the minimization of an expected loss\n(e.g. minimum mean squared error, or MMSE). The second route has received much\nattention in the context of sparse regularization and compressive sensing: it\nconsists in designing (often convex) optimization problems involving the sum of\na data fidelity term and a penalty term promoting certain types of unknowns\n(e.g., sparsity, promoted through an 1 norm). Well known relations between\nthese two approaches have lead to some widely spread misconceptions. In\nparticular, while the so-called Maximum A Posterori (MAP) estimate with a\nGaussian noise model does lead to an optimization problem with a quadratic\ndata-fidelity term, we disprove through explicit examples the common belief\nthat the converse would be true. It has already been shown [7, 9] that for\ndenoising in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, for any prior probability\non the unknowns, MMSE estimation can be expressed as a penalized least squares\nproblem, with the apparent characteristics of a MAP estimation problem with\nGaussian noise and a (generally) different prior on the unknowns. In other\nwords, the variational approach is rich enough to build all possible MMSE\nestimators associated to additive Gaussian noise via a well chosen penalty. We\ngeneralize these results beyond Gaussian denoising and characterize noise\nmodels for which the same phenomenon occurs. In particular, we prove that with\n(a variant of) Poisson noise and any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE\nestimation can again be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares\noptimization problem. For additive scalar denois-ing the phenomenon holds if\nand only if the noise distribution is log-concave. In particular, Laplacian\ndenoising can (perhaps surprisingly) be expressed as the solution of a\npenalized least squares problem. In the multivariate case, the same phenomenon\noccurs when the noise model belongs to a particular subset of the exponential\nfamily. For multivariate additive denoising, the phenomenon holds if and only\nif the noise is white and Gaussian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 09:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 08:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

The origin of these so-called Fast\nRadio Bursts (FRBs) is still a great mystery despite the growing observational\nefforts made by various multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities. So\nfar, many models have been proposed to explain FRBs but neither the progenitors\nnor the radiative and the particle acceleration processes at work have been\nclearly identified. In this paper, the question whether some hadronic processes\nmay occur in the vicinity of the FRB source is assessed. If so, FRBs may\ncontribute to the high energy cosmic-ray and neutrino fluxes. A search for\nthese hadronic signatures has been done using the ANTARES neutrino telescope.\nThe analysis consists in looking for high-energy neutrinos, in the TeV-PeV\nregime, spatially and temporally coincident with the detected FRBs. Most of the\nFRBs discovered in the period 2013-2017 were in the field of view of the\nANTARES detector, which is sensitive mostly to events originating from the\nSouthern hemisphere. From this period, 12 FRBs have been selected and no\ncoincident neutrino candidate was observed.

An HI cavity filled with hot X-ray gas is associated\nwith the structure, which is consistent with the Galactic chimney scenario. The\nX-ray emission extends beyond the west and north-west edges of the bubble,\nsuggesting that hot gas outflows are breaching the cavity, possibly through the\nfragmented Lupus complex. Analyses of the polarised radio synchrotron and of\nthe polarised dust emission of the region suggest the connection of the\nGalactic centre spur with the young Galactic bubble. A distribution of HI\nclumps that spatially corresponds well to the cavity boundaries was found at\nV_LSR ~ -100 km/s.

Toward this end, we introduce a new cosmological initial\ncondition generator BCCOMICS, which solves the quasi-linear evolution of\nsmall-scale perturbations under the large-scale density and streaming-velocity\nenvironment and generates the initial condition for dark matter and baryons, as\neither particles or grid data at a specific redshift. We also describe a scheme\nto simulate the formation of first galaxies inside density peaks and voids,\nwhere a local environment is treated as a separate universe. The resulting\ncosmic variance in the minihalo number density and the amount of cooling mass\nare presented as an application. Density peaks become a site for enhanced\nformation of first galaxies, which compete with the negative effect from the\ndark matter-baryon streaming velocity on structure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 10:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 17:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

A\nmethod for computing the index for small scale networked control systems is\nderived, and it is shown that the index can potentially be increased by placing\nadditional sensors. The difficulties that appear once the system is of a large\nscale are then outlined: the problem of calculating the index is NP--hard, the\nindex is vulnerable to system variations, and it is based on the assumption\nthat the attacker knows the entire model of the system. To overcome these\ndifficulties, a robust security index is introduced. The robust index can be\ncalculated in polynomial time, it is unaffected by the system variations, and\nit can be related to both limited and full model knowledge attackers.\nAdditionally, we analyze two sensor placement problems with the objective to\nincrease the robust indices.

It\nis currently adopted for many different kinds of wireless network problems such\nas power consumption issues, modelling the communication environment, and\nreceived signal strength (RSS)-based localization. PLE estimation is thus of\ngreat use to assist in wireless networking. However, a majority of methods to\nestimate the PLE require either some particular information of the wireless\nnetwork, which might be unknown or some external auxiliary devices, such as\nanchor nodes or the Global Positioning System. Moreover, this external\ninformation might sometimes be unreliable, spoofed, or difficult to obtain.\nTherefore, a self-estimator for the PLE, which is able to work independently,\nbecomes an urgent demand to robustly and securely get a grip on the PLE for\nvarious wireless network applications. This paper is the first to introduce two\nmethods that can solely and locally estimate the PLE. To start, a new linear\nregression model for the PLE is presented. Based on this model, a closed-form\ntotal least squares (TLS) method to estimate the PLE is first proposed, in\nwhich, with no other assistance or external information, each node can estimate\nthe PLE merely by collecting RSSs. Second, to suppress the estimation errors, a\nclosed-form weighted TLS method is further developed, having a better\nperformance. Due to their simplicity and independence of any auxiliary system,\nour two proposed methods can be easily incorporated into any kind of wireless\ncommunication stack. Simulation results show that our estimators are reliable,\neven in harsh environments, where the PLE is high.

An\nunexplored, so far, interface is the coupling between light and topologically\nprotected particle like excitations as magnetic domain walls, skyrmions or\nvortices.

The corrections for A(Li) and\n6Li/7Li are computed using grids of 3D NLTE and 1D LTE synthetic lithium line\nprofiles, generated from 3D hydro-dynamical CO5BOLD and 1D hydrostatic model\natmospheres, respectively. The 3D NLTE corrections are then approximated by\nanalytical expressions as a function of the stellar parameters. These are\napplied to adjust the 1D LTE isotopic lithium abundances in two solar-type\nstars, HD 207129 and HD 95456. The derived 3D NLTE corrections range between\n-0.01 and +0.11 dex for A(Li), and between -4.9 and -0.4% for the 6Li/7Li\nratio, depending on the adopted stellar parameters. In the case of the 6Li/7Li\nratio, our corrections are always negative, showing that 1D LTE analysis can\nsignificantly overestimate (up to 4.9 percentage points) the presence of 6Li in\nthe atmospheres of solar-like dwarf stars. These results emphasize the\nimportance of reliable 3D model atmospheres combined with NLTE line formation\nfor deriving precise isotopic lithium abundances. Although 3D NLTE spectral\nsynthesis implies an extensive computational effort, the results can be made\naccessible with parametric tools like the ones presented in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 11:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Using this relationship, we show that\narbitrarily large weak value amplification far beyond the conventional weak\nmeasurement limit can be experimentally obtained from the position of the\nminima of the pointer intensity profile corresponding to the real part of the\ncomplex zero of the response function. The imaginary part of the complex zero,\non the other hand, is related to the spatial gradient of geometric phase of\nlight, which in this particular scenario evolves due to the weak interaction\nand the pre and post selections of the polarization states.

In the compaction of the key-value\nstore, SSTables are merged with overlapping key ranges and sorted for data\nqueries. This, however, incurs write amplification and thus degrades system\nperformance, especially under update-intensive workloads. Current optimization\nfocuses mostly on the reduction of the overload of compaction in the host, but\nrarely makes full use of computation in the device. To address these issues, we\npropose Co-KV, a Collaborative Key-Value store between the host and a near-data\nprocessing ( i.e., NDP) model based SSD to improve compaction. Co-KV offers\nthree benefits: (1) reducing write amplification by a compaction offloading\nscheme between host and device; (2) relieving the overload of compaction in the\nhost and leveraging computation in the SSD based on the NDP model; and (3)\nimproving the performance of LSM-tree based key-value stores under\nupdate-intensive workloads.\n  Extensive db_bench experiment show that Co-KV largely achieves a 2.0x overall\nthroughput improvement, and a write amplification reduction by up to 36.0% over\nthe state-of-the-art LevelDB. Under YCSB workloads, Co-KV increases the\nthroughput by 1.7x - 2.4x while decreases the write amplification and average\nlatency by up to 30.0% and 43.0%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

At the same time it poses many new challenges from the\ntechnological standpoint, one of them being the image segmentation stage, which\nhas proven difficult to be reliably executed by conventional iris recognition\nmethods. Our approach is based on the SegNet architecture, fine-tuned with\n1,300 manually segmented post-mortem iris images taken from the\nWarsaw-BioBase-Post-Mortem-Iris v1.0 database. The experiments presented in\nthis paper show that this data-driven solution is able to learn specific\ndeformations present in post-mortem samples, which are missing from alive\nirises, and offers a considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art,\nconventional segmentation algorithm (OSIRIS): the Intersection over Union (IoU)\nmetric was improved from 73.6% (for OSIRIS) to 83% (for DCNN-based presented in\nthis paper) averaged over subject-disjoint, multiple splits of the data into\ntrain and test subsets.

NISP will be tested at\nLaboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) in ERIOS chamber under vacuum\nand thermal conditions in order to qualify the instrument in its operating\nenvironment and to perform the final acceptance test before delivery to the\npayload. One of the main objectives of the test campaign will be the\nmeasurement of the focus position of NISP image plane with respect to the\nEUCLID object plane. To simulate the EUCLID object plane, a telescope simulator\nwith a very well know focal distance will be installed in front of NISP into\nERIOS chamber. We need to measure at cold and vacuum the position of reflectors\ninstalled on NISP instrument and the telescope simulator. From these\nmeasurements, we will provide at operational temperature the measurement of\nreferences frames set on the telescope simulator and NISP, the knowledge of the\ncoordinates of the object point source provided by the telescope simulator and\nthe measurement of the angle between the telescope simulator optical axis and\nNISP optical axis. In this context, we have developed a metrology method based\non the use of a laser tracker to measure the position of the reflectors inside\nERIOS. The laser tracker is installed outside the vacuum chamber and measure\nthrough a curved window reflectors put inside the chamber either at ambient\npressure or vacuum pressure. Several tests campaigns have been done at LAM to\ndemonstrate the measurement performance with this configuration. Using a well\nknow reflectors configuration, we show that it is possible to correct the laser\ntracker measurement from the window disturbances and from the vacuum impact.

In this setup, a distribution of the rent and an allocation is said to\nbe fair if it is envy free, i.e., under the imposed rents, no agent has a\nstrictly stronger preference for any other agent's room. The cardinal\npreferences of the agents are expressed via functions which specify the\nutilities of the agents for the rooms at every possible room rent/price. While\nenvy-free solutions are guaranteed to exist under reasonably general utility\nfunctions, efficient algorithms for finding them were known only for\nquasilinear utilities. This work addresses this notable gap and develops\napproximation algorithms for fair rent division with minimal assumptions on the\nutility functions.\n  Specifically, we show that if the agents have continuous, monotone\ndecreasing, and piecewise-linear utilities, then the fair rent-division problem\nadmits a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). That is, we\ndevelop algorithms that find allocations and prices of the rooms such that for\neach agent a the utility of the room assigned to it is within a factor of $(1 +\n\\epsilon)$ of the utility of the room most preferred by a. Here, $\\epsilon>0$\nis an approximation parameter, and the running time of the algorithms is\npolynomial in $1/\\epsilon$ and the input size. In addition, we show that the\nmethods developed in this work provide truthful mechanisms for special cases of\nthe rent-division problem. Envy-free solutions correspond to equilibria of a\ntwo-sided matching market with monetary transfers; hence, this work also\nprovides efficient algorithms for finding approximate equilibria in such\nmarkets. We complement the algorithmic results by proving that the fair rent\ndivision problem lies in the intersection of the complexity classes PPAD and\nPLS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

However, when the goal\nis to characterize climatological features of extreme precipitation over a\nspatial domain (e.g., a map of return values) at the native spatial scales of\nthese phenomena, then gridded products may lead to incorrect conclusions\nbecause daily precipitation is a fractal field and hence any smoothing\ntechnique will dampen local extremes. To address this issue, we create a new\n\"probabilistic\" gridded product specifically designed to characterize the\nclimatological properties of extreme precipitation by applying spatial\nstatistical analyses to daily measurements of precipitation from the GHCN over\nCONUS. The essence of our method is to first estimate the climatology of\nextreme precipitation based on station data and then use a data-driven\nstatistical approach to interpolate these estimates to a fine grid. We argue\nthat our method yields an improved characterization of the climatology within a\ngrid cell because the probabilistic behavior of extreme precipitation is much\nbetter behaved (i.e., smoother) than daily weather. Furthermore, the spatial\nsmoothing innate to our approach significantly increases the signal-to-noise\nratio in the estimated extreme statistics relative to an analysis without\nsmoothing. Finally, by deriving a data-driven approach for translating extreme\nstatistics to a spatially complete grid, the methodology outlined in this paper\nresolves the issue of how to properly compare station data with output from\nearth system models. We conclude the paper by comparing our probabilistic\ngridded product with a standard extreme value analysis of the Livneh gridded\ndaily precipitation product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:52:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 20:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Here we provide the\nexample of a spin chain with random and inhomogeneous couplings that in the\nground state exhibits a very unusual area law violation. In the clean limit,\ni.e., without disorder, the model is the rainbow chain and has volume law\nentanglement. We show that, in the presence of disorder, the entanglement\nentropy exhibits a power-law growth with the subsystem size, with an exponent\n1/2. By employing the Strong Disorder Renormalization Group (SDRG) framework,\nwe show that this exponent is related to the survival probability of certain\nrandom walks. The ground state of the model exhibits extended regions of\nshort-range singlets (that we term ``bubble'' regions) as well as rare long\nrange singlet (``rainbow'' regions). Crucially, while the probability of\nextended rainbow regions decays exponentially with their size, that of the\nbubble regions is power law. We provide strong numerical evidence for the\ncorrectness of SDRG results by exploiting the free-fermion solution of the\nmodel. Finally, we investigate the role of interactions by considering the\nrandom inhomogeneous XXZ spin chain. Within the SDRG framework and in the\nstrong inhomogeneous limit, we show that the above area-law violation takes\nplace only at the free-fermion point of phase diagram.

In short, the celebrated performance of these\nnetworks and their vulnerability to adversarial attack are simply two sides of\nthe same coin: the input image-space directions along which the networks are\nmost vulnerable to attack are the same directions which they use to achieve\ntheir classification performance in the first place.

However, CR suffers from the\nsparsity problem, mainly because it associates similar users based on exact\nmatching of the venues in their check-in history. Even though research in\ncollaborative filtering has shown that considering auxiliary information such\nas geographical influence, helps the model to alleviate the sparsity problem,\nthe same direction still needs to be explored in CR. In this work, we present a\nCR framework that focuses on the top of the ranked list while integrating an\narbitrary number of similarity functions between venues as it learns the\nmodel's parameters. We further introduce three example similarity measures\nbased on venues' contents and locations. Incorporating cross-venue similarity\nmeasures into the model enhances the latent associations between users as\nsimilar venues are also taken into account while associating users with each\nother. Our experiments on the TREC Contextual Suggestion dataset show that our\nproposed CR model beats other state-of-the-art venue suggestion methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 15:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 12:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-16"}

These compact\nor sparse models are different from the traditional large ones in that there is\nmuch more variation in their layer shapes and sizes, and often require\nspecialized hardware to exploit sparsity for performance improvement.

Finding sparse representations is a fundamentally important topic in\nmany fields of science including signal processing, computer vision, genome\nstudy and medical imaging. One important issue in applying sparse\nrepresentation is to find the basis to represent the data,especially in\ncomputer vision and medical imaging where the data is not necessary incoherent.\nIn medical imaging, clinicians often grade the severity or measure the risk\nscore of a disease based on images. This process is referred to as medical\nimage grading. Manual grading of the disease severity or risk score is often\nused. However, it is tedious, subjective and expensive. Sparse learning has\nbeen used for automatic grading of medical images for different diseases. In\nthe grading, we usually begin with one step to find a sparse representation of\nthe testing image using a set of reference images or atoms from the dictionary.\nThen in the second step, the selected atoms are used as references to compute\nthe grades of the testing images. Since the two steps are conducted\nsequentially, the objective function in the first step is not necessarily\noptimized for the second step. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse\nrange-constrained learning(SRCL)algorithm for medical image grading.Different\nfrom most of existing sparse learning algorithms, SRCL integrates the objective\nof finding a sparse representation and that of grading the image into one\nfunction. It aims to find a sparse representation of the testing image based on\natoms that are most similar in both the data or feature representation and the\nmedical grading scores.

Methods based on various deep neural networks have\nbeen proposed for image classification, which could be applied to apparel\nattributes recognition. An interesting problem raised is how to ensemble these\nmethods to further improve the accuracy. In this paper, we propose a two-layer\nmixture framework for ensemble different networks. In the first layer of this\nframework, two types of ensemble learning methods, bagging and boosting, are\nseparately applied. Different from traditional methods, our bagging process\nmakes use of the whole training set, not random subsets, to train each model in\nthe ensemble, where several differentiated deep networks are used to promote\nmodel variance. To avoid the bias of small-scale samples, the second layer only\nadopts bagging to mix the results obtained with bagging and boosting in the\nfirst layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mixture\nframework outperforms any individual network model or either independent\nensemble method in apparel attributes classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 10:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

The ultimate goal of researchers globally is\ntowards the development of free standing solid polymeric separator for energy\nstorage devices. This single free standing solid polymeric separator may\nreplace the liquid and separator (organic/Inorganic) used in existing\nefficient/smart energy technology. As an example polyethylene oxide (PEO)\nconsist of an electron donor rich group which provides coordinating sites to\nthe cation for migration. Owing to this exclusive structure PEO exhibits some\nremarkable properties such as; low glass transition temperature, excellent\nflexibility and ability to make complexation with various metal salts which are\nunattainable by another polymer host. Hence, the PEO is the most emerging\ncandidate that have been examined or is currently under audition for\napplication in energy storage devices. So, this review article first provides\nthe detailed study of the PEO properties, characteristic of constituents of the\npolymer electrolyte and suitable approaches for the modification of polymer\nelectrolytes. Then, the synthesization and characterizations techniques are\noutlined. The structures, characteristics, and performance during\ncharge-discharge of four types of electrolyte/separators which are Liquid,\nPlasticized, and dispersed/intercalated electrolyte are highlighted.

The research on\ntunable periodic structures is focused on the design, modeling and\nunderstanding of wave propagation phenomena and the dynamic response of smart\nphononic crystals. High amplitude wrinkle formation is employed to study a\none-dimensional phononic crystal slab consists of a thin film bonded to a thick\ncompliant substrate. Buckling induced surface instability generates a wrinkly\nstructure triggered by a compressive strain. It is demonstrated that surface\nperiodic pattern and the corresponding large deformation can control elastic\nwave propagation in the low thickness composite slab. Simulation results show\nthat the periodic wrinkly structure can be used as a smart phononic crystal\nwhich can switch band diagrams of the structure in a transformative manner. A\nmagnetoactive phononic crystal is proposed which its dynamic properties are\ncontrolled by combined effects of large deformations and an applied magnetic\nfield. Finite deformations and magnetic induction influence phononic\ncharacteristics of the periodic structure through geometrical pattern\ntransformation and material properties. A magnetoelastic energy function is\nproposed to develop constitutive laws considering large deformations and\nmagnetic induction in the periodic structure. Analytical and finite element\nmethods are utilized to compute dispersion relation and band structure of the\nphononic crystal for different cases of deformation and magnetic loadings. It\nis demonstrated that magnetic induction not only controls the band diagram of\nthe structure but also has a strong effect on preferential directions of wave\npropagation. Moreover, a thermally controlled phononic crystal is designed\nusing ligaments of bi-materials in the structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 16:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}
