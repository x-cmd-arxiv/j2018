The cellular\ngoal (the optimization problem that the cell is trying to solve) can be\nchallenging to derive experimentally for many organisms, including human or\nmammalian cells, which have complex metabolic capabilities and are not well\nunderstood. Existing approaches to learning goals from data include (a)\nestimating a linear objective function, or (b) estimating linear constraints\nthat model complex biochemical reactions and constrain the cell's operation.\nThe latter approach is important because often the known/observed biochemical\nreactions are not enough to explain observations, and hence there is a need to\nextend automatically the model complexity by learning new chemical reactions.\nHowever, this leads to nonconvex optimization problems, and existing tools\ncannot scale to realistically large metabolic models. Hence, constraint\nestimation is still used sparingly despite its benefits for modeling cell\nmetabolism, which is important for developing novel antimicrobials against\npathogens, discovering cancer drug targets, and producing value-added\nchemicals.

We show that OMWU monotonically improves the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence of the current iterate to the (appropriately normalized) min-max\nsolution until it enters a neighborhood of the solution. Inside that\nneighborhood we show that OMWU is locally (asymptotically) stable converging to\nthe exact solution. We believe that our techniques will be useful in the\nanalysis of the last iterate of other learning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 17:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 12:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 10:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 06:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

As\nis common in many imaging problems, natural signals are considered sparse with\nrespect to a known basis, and the generic sparsity prior is enforced via\n$\\ell_1$ regularization. While successful in the realm of linear inverse\nproblems, such $\\ell_1$ methods have encountered possibly fundamental\nlimitations, as no computationally efficient algorithm for phase retrieval of a\n$k$-sparse signal has been proven to succeed with fewer than $O(k^2\\log n)$\ngeneric measurements, exceeding the theoretical optimum of $O(k \\log n)$. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework for phase retrieval by 1) modeling\nnatural signals as being in the range of a deep generative neural network $G :\n\\mathbb{R}^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ and 2) enforcing this prior directly by\noptimizing an empirical risk objective over the domain of the generator. Our\nformulation has provably favorable global geometry for gradient methods, as\nsoon as $m = O(kd^2\\log n)$, where $d$ is the depth of the network.\nSpecifically, when suitable deterministic conditions on the generator and\nmeasurement matrix are met, we construct a descent direction for any point\noutside of a small neighborhood around the unique global minimizer and its\nnegative multiple, and show that such conditions hold with high probability\nunder Gaussian ensembles of multilayer fully-connected generator networks and\nmeasurement matrices. This formulation for structured phase retrieval thus has\ntwo advantages over sparsity based methods: 1) deep generative priors can more\ntightly represent natural signals and 2) information theoretically optimal\nsample complexity. We corroborate these results with experiments showing that\nexploiting generative models in phase retrieval tasks outperforms sparse phase\nretrieval methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 17:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

We show that inside 25 kpc the \"Sausage\"\ncontributes at least 50 % of the Galactic halo. The fraction of \"Sausage\" stars\ndiminishes sharply beyond 30 kpc, which is the long-established break radius of\nthe classical stellar halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 19:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

Their strong mass-loss furthermore\nprovides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds.\nThus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for\nseveral astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first time parallaxes for\na large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties\ninherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine the sample from Sander\net al. (2012) to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All\nquantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral\nanalyses remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields\nthat WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude.\nWith Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex:\nWe obtain luminosities ranging from log L = 4.9 to 6.0 with one outlier having\nlog L = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader\ninitial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates ranging\nbetween log Mdot = -5.1 and -4.1, with Mdot propto L^0.68 and a linear scaling\nof the modified wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for\nstellar evolution, including unsolved issues regarding the need of envelope\ninflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions in regard to\nthe connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts.

We interpret the\nquasi-simultaneous neutrino and broadband electromagnetic observations with a\nnovel one-zone lepto-hadronic model, based on interactions of electrons and\nprotons co-accelerated in the jet with external photons originating from a\nslow-moving plasma sheath surrounding the faster jet spine. We can reproduce\nthe multiwavelength spectra of TXS 0506+056 with neutrino rate and energy\ncompatible with IceCube-170922A, and with plausible values for the jet power of\n$\\sim 10^{45} - 4 \\times 10^{46} {\\rm erg \\ s^{-1}}$. The steep spectrum\nobserved by MAGIC is concordant with internal $\\gamma\\gamma$ absorption above a\nfew tens of GeV entailed by photohadronic production of a $\\sim$290 TeV\nneutrino, corroborating a genuine connection between the multi-messenger\nsignals. In contrast to previous predictions of predominantly hadronic emission\nfrom neutrino sources, the gamma-rays can be mostly ascribed to inverse Compton\nup-scattering of external photons by accelerated electrons. The X-ray and VHE\nbands provide crucial constraints on the emission from both accelerated\nelectrons and protons. We infer that the maximum energy of protons in the jet\nco-moving frame can be in the range $\\sim 10^{14}$ to $10^{18}$ eV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 18:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 11:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

For example,\nin Minimum Makespan Vehicle Routing, the number of vehicles is fixed, and the\nobjective is to minimize the longest distance traveled by a single vehicle. Our\nmain insight is that we can often greatly restrict the set of potential\nsolutions without adding too much to the optimal solution cost. This\nsimplification relies on partitioning the tree into clusters such that there\nexists a near-optimal solution in which every vehicle that visits a given\ncluster takes on one of a few forms. In particular, only a small number of\nvehicles serve clients in any given cluster. By using these coarser building\nblocks, a dynamic programming algorithm can find a near-optimal solution in\npolynomial time.

To investigate how OV could enhance chemotherapy, we\npropose an ODE based model describing the interactions between tumour cells,\nthe immune response, and a treatment combination with chemotherapy and\noncolytic viruses. Stability analysis of the model with constant chemotherapy\ntreatment rates shows that without any form of treatment, a tumour would grow\nto its maximum size. It also demonstrates that chemotherapy alone is capable of\nclearing tumour cells provided that the drug efficacy is greater than the\nintrinsic tumour growth rate. Furthermore, OV alone may not be able to clear\ntumour cells from body tissue but would rather enhance chemotherapy if viruses\nwith high viral potency are used. To assess the combined effect of OV and\nchemotherapy we use the forward sensitivity index to perform a sensitivity\nanalysis, with respect to chemotherapy key parameters, of the virus basic\nreproductive number and the tumour endemic equilibrium.

Two theoretical properties of the\nAvgAICc approach might justify that future studies will prefer its use over\nalternative approaches: (1) it is not limited to make predictions based on a\nsingle model, but it also uses secondary models that might have important\npredictive power absent in a given single model favored by alternative\noptimality criteria; (2) it balances goodness of fit and model accuracy, this\nbeing of critical importance in applications of ENM that require model\ntransference.\n  Main conclusions: Our introduction of the AvgAICc approach in ENM; its\ntheoretical properties, which are expected to confer advantages over\nalternatives approaches; and the differences we found when comparing the\nAvgAICc approach with alternative ones; should eventually lead to a wider use\nof the AvgAICc approach.

In this paper, a real-time IoT monitoring system\nis considered, in which the IoT devices sample a physical process with a\nsampling cost and send the status packet to a given destination with an\nupdating cost. This joint status sampling and updating process is designed to\nminimize the average age of information (AoI) at the destination node under an\naverage energy cost constraint at each device. This is formulated as an\ninfinite horizon average cost constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and\ntransformed into an unconstrained MDP using a Lagrangian method. For the single\nIoT device case, the optimal policy for the CMDP is shown to be a randomized\nmixture of two deterministic policies for the unconstrained MDP, which is of\nthreshold type. Then, a structure-aware optimal algorithm to obtain the optimal\npolicy of the CMDP is proposed and the impact of the wireless channel dynamics\nis studied while demonstrating that channels having a larger mean channel gain\nand less scattering can achieve better AoI performance. For the case of\nmultiple IoT devices, a low-complexity distributed suboptimal policy is\nproposed with the updating control at the destination and the sampling control\nat each device. Then, an online learning algorithm is developed to obtain this\npolicy, which can be implemented at each IoT device and requires only the local\nknowledge and small signaling from the destination. The proposed learning\nalgorithm is shown to converge almost surely to the suboptimal policy.\nSimulation results show the structural properties of the optimal policy for the\nsingle IoT device case; and show that the proposed policy for multiple IoT\ndevices outperforms a zero-wait baseline policy, with average AoI reductions\nreaching up to 33%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 21:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 14:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

Polymer melts with chain lengths set to follow a Schulz-Zimm\ndistribution for the same average M_w = 36 kg/mol with D_M = 1.0 to 1.16, were\nstudied for times of $600-800$ $\\mu$s using molecular dynamics simulations.\nThis time frame is longer than the time required to reach the diffusive regime.\nWe find that dispersity in this range does not affect the entanglement time or\ntube diameter. However, while there is negligible difference in the average\nmobility of chains for the uniform distribution D_M=1.0 and D_M = 1.02, the\nshortest chains move significantly faster than the longest ones offering a\nconstraint release pathway for the melts for larger D_M.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 22:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

It was recently proposed that potentials of the string landscape\nmust satisfy at least two conditions, the \"swampland criteria\", that severely\nrestrict the types of cosmological dynamics they can sustain. The first\ncriterion states that the (multi-field) effective field theory description is\nonly valid over a field displacement $\\Delta \\phi \\leq \\Delta \\sim \\mathcal\nO(1)$ (in units where the Planck mass is 1), measured as a distance in the\ntarget space geometry. A second, more recent, criterion asserts that, whenever\nthe potential $V$ is positive, its slope must be bounded from below, and\nsuggests $|\\nabla V| / V \\geq c \\sim \\mathcal O(1)$. A recent analysis\nconcluded that these two conditions taken together practically rule out\nslow-roll models of inflation. In this note we show that the two conditions\nrule out inflationary backgrounds that follow geodesic trajectories in field\nspace, but not those following curved, non-geodesic, trajectories (which are\nparametrized by a non-vanishing bending rate $\\Omega$ of the multi-field\ntrajectory). We derive a universal lower bound on $\\Omega$ (relative to the\nHubble parameter $H$) as a function of $\\Delta, c$ and the number of efolds\n$N_e$, assumed to be at least of order 60.

Low first ionization potential (FIP)\nelements are enhanced by factors of several. A similar effect is seen in the\natmospheres of some solar-like stars, while late type M stars show an inverse\nFIP effect. This inverse effect was recently detected on the Sun during solar\nflares, potentially allowing a very detailed look at the spatial and temporal\nbehavior that is not possible from stellar observations. A key question for\ninterpreting these measurements is whether both effects act solely on low FIP\nelements (a true inverse effect predicted by some models), or whether the\ninverse FIP effect arises because high FIP elements are enhanced. Here we\ndevelop a new diagnostic that can discriminate between the two scenarios, based\non modeling of the radiated power loss, and applying the models to a numerical\nhydrodynamic simulation of coronal loop cooling. We show that when low/high FIP\nelements are depleted/enhanced, there is a significant difference in the\ncooling lifetime of loops that is greatest at lower temperatures. We apply this\ndiagnostic to a post X1.8 flare loop arcade and inverse FIP region, and show\nthat for this event, low FIP elements are depleted. We discuss the results in\nthe context of stellar observations, and models of the FIP and inverse FIP\neffect.

To ensure the translated images are realistically plausible,\nrecent works, such as Cycle-GAN, demands this mapping to be invertible. While,\nthis requirement demonstrates promising results when the domains are unimodal,\nits performance is unpredictable in a multi-modal scenario such as in an image\nsegmentation task. This is because, invertibility does not necessarily enforce\nsemantic correctness. To this end, we present a semantically-consistent GAN\nframework, dubbed Sem-GAN, in which the semantics are defined by the class\nidentities of image segments in the source domain as produced by a semantic\nsegmentation algorithm. Our proposed framework includes consistency constraints\non the translation task that, together with the GAN loss and the\ncycle-constraints, enforces that the images when translated will inherit the\nappearances of the target domain, while (approximately) maintaining their\nidentities from the source domain. We present experiments on several\nimage-to-image translation tasks and demonstrate that Sem-GAN improves the\nquality of the translated images significantly, sometimes by more than 20% on\nthe FCN score. Further, we show that semantic segmentation models, trained with\nsynthetic images translated via Sem-GAN, leads to significantly better\nsegmentation results than other variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 02:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

Our goal is\nless than 1 microradian drift in tilt per mirror per one degree Celsius change\nin temperature. There are no commercial 2inch kinematic optical mounts that are\ntruly \"zero-drift\" from 0-20C. Our solution to this problem was to develop a\nlocking clamp to keep our optics stable and fulfill our specifications. After\nperforming temperature variation and thermal shock testing, we conclude that\nthis novel locking clamp significantly increases the thermal stability of\nstainless steel mounts by ~10x but still allows accurate microradian\npositioning of a mirror.

Although SDPs can be solved to arbitrary precision in\npolynomial time, generic convex solvers do not scale well with the dimension of\nthe problem. In order to address this issue, Burer and Monteiro proposed to\nreduce the dimension of the problem by appealing to a low-rank factorization\nand solve the subsequent non-convex problem instead. In this paper, we present\ncoordinate ascent based methods to solve this non-convex problem with provable\nconvergence guarantees.

We establish that this condition generically holds when the\nrank of the factorization is sufficiently large.

We propose adding a\nsimple yet effective Element-wiseAttention Gate (EleAttG) to an RNN block\n(e.g., all RNN neurons in a network layer) that empowers the RNN neurons to\nhave the attentiveness capability. For an RNN block, an EleAttG is added to\nadaptively modulate the input by assigning different levels of importance,\ni.e., attention, to each element/dimension of the input. We refer to an RNN\nblock equipped with an EleAttG as an EleAtt-RNN block. Specifically, the\nmodulation of the input is content adaptive and is performed at fine\ngranularity, being element-wise rather than input-wise. The proposed EleAttG,\nas an additional fundamental unit, is general and can be applied to any RNN\nstructures, e.g., standard RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU).

This leads to large gains in spectral\nand energy efficiency compared with other technologies. As the number of\nantennas M grows, the performance of such systems gets limited by pilot\ncontamination interference. Large Scale Fading Precoding/Postcoding (LSFP) was\nproposed in literature for mitigation of pilot contamination. It was shown\nrecently that in channels without spatial correlation (uncorrelated base\nstation antennas) LSFP leads to large spectral-efficiency gains. Also,\nrecently, it was observed that if a channel has spatial correlation, then one\ncan use this correlation to drastically reduce the pilot contamination\ninterference in the asymptotic regime as M tends to infinity. In this work, we\nanalyze the performance of Uplink (UL) transmission of massive MIMO systems\nwith finitely many antennas M for channels with spatial correlation. We extend\nthe idea of LSFP to correlated channel models and derive SINR expressions that\ndepend only on slow fading channel components for such systems with and without\nLSFP. These simple expressions lead us to simple algorithms for transmit power\noptimization. As a result, we obtain a multi-fold increase in data transmission\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 08:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

Our\nphotometric survey on Magellanic Clouds clusters has revealed that NGC1818,\nsimilarly to the other young objects with age 600 Myrs, displays not only an\nextended MS Turn-Off (eMSTO), as observed in intermediate-age clusters (age~1-2\nGyrs), but also a split MS. The most straightforward interpretation of the\ndouble MS is the presence of two stellar populations: a sequence of\nslowly-rotating stars lying on the blue-MS and a sequence of fast rotators,\nwith rotation close to the breaking speed, defining a red-MS. We report the\nfirst direct spectroscopic measurements of projected rotational velocities\nvsini for the double MS, eMSTO and Be stars of a young cluster. The analysis of\nline profiles includes non-LTE effects, required for correctly deriving v sini\nvalues. Our results suggest that: (i) the mean rotation for blue- and red-MS\nstars is vsini=71\\pm10 km/s (sigma=37 km/s) and vsini=202\\pm23 km/s (sigma=91\nkm/s), respectively; (ii) eMSTO stars have different vsini, which are generally\nlower than those inferred for red-MS stars, and (iii) as expected, Be stars\ndisplay the highest vsini values. This analyis supports the idea that distinct\nrotational velocities play an important role in the appearence of multiple\nstellar populations in the color-magnitude diagrams of young clusters, and\nposes new constraints to the current scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 09:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

While the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture fails\nin general by a counterexample of Dieterich dealing with multiplicities to\nmeasure the size of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, our formalism establishes\nthe validity of the conjecture for complete Cohen-Macaulay local rings. In\naddition, the pure-semisimplicity of a subcategory of balanced big\nCohen-Macaulay modules is settled.

We focus on two different models where the scalar field couples\nlinearly or quadratically to the standard model of matter fields. For both\nthese cases, we derive the solutions of the scalar field. We also derive from\nfirst principles the expressions for two types of observables: (i) the local\ncomparison of two atomic sensors that are differently sensitive to the\nconstants of Nature and (ii) the local differential acceleration between two\ntest-masses with different compositions. For the linear coupling, we recover\nthat the signatures induced by DM on both observables are the sum of harmonic\nand Yukawa terms. For the quadratic coupling on the other hand, the signatures\nderived for both types of observables turn out to be a sum of a time\nindependent term and of an harmonic oscillation, whose amplitudes both depend\non the position. Such a behavior is new and can make experiments in space more\nsensitive than terrestrial ones. Besides, the observables present some\ninteresting non-linear behaviors that are due to the amplification or to the\nscreening of the scalar-field, depending on the parameters of the theory, and\non the compactness of the source of the gravitational field. Finally, we infer\nthe various limits on the DM coupling parameters by using existing frequency\ncomparisons on the one hand and tests of the universality of free fall on the\nground (torsion balances) or in space (MICROSCOPE mission) on the other hand.\nWe show that in the quadratic case, so-called natural parameters are still\nallowed by observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 10:14:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 18:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 18:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

We present a comprehensive\nanalysis of TXS 0506+056 during its flaring state, using newly collected Swift,\nNuSTAR, and X-shooter data with Fermi observations and numerical models to\nconstrain the blazar's particle acceleration processes and multimessenger\n(electromagnetic and high-energy neutrino) emissions. Accounting properly for\nelectromagnetic cascades in the emission region, we find a\nphysically-consistent picture only within a hybrid leptonic scenario, with\ngamma-rays produced by external inverse-Compton processes and high-energy\nneutrinos via a radiatively-subdominant hadronic component. We derive robust\nconstraints on the blazar's neutrino and cosmic-ray emissions and demonstrate\nthat, because of cascade effects, the 0.1-100keV emissions of TXS 0506+056\nserve as a better probe of its hadronic acceleration and high-energy neutrino\nproduction processes than its GeV-TeV emissions. If the IceCube neutrino\nassociation holds, physical conditions in the TXS 0506+056 jet must be close to\noptimal for high-energy neutrino production, and are not favorable for\nultra-high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. Alternatively, the challenges we\nidentify in generating a significant rate of IceCube neutrino detections from\nTXS 0506+056 may disfavor single-zone models. In concert with continued\noperations of the high-energy neutrino observatories, we advocate regular X-ray\nmonitoring of TXS 0506+056 and other blazars in order to test single-zone\nblazar emission models, clarify the nature and extent of their hadronic\nacceleration processes, and carry out the most sensitive possible search for\nadditional multimessenger sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 11:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

A classical theorem of J.~Wolf shows that any involutive automorphism of\na semisimple Lie group $G$ with fixed point group $H$ gives rise to a large\nfamily of such compactifications of homogeneous spaces of $H$. Most examples of\n(classical) Riemannian symmetric spaces as well as many non--symmetric examples\narise in this way.

In the range of the investigated angles\nof attack, statistics of the flow-field suggest the existence of three distinct\nangle-of-attack regimes: 1) the flow and aerodynamic characteristics are not\nmuch affected by the LFO for angles of attack $\\alpha < 9.25^{\\circ}$; 2) the\nflow-field undergoes a transition regime in which the bubble bursting and\nreformation cycle, LFO, develops until it reaches a quasi-periodic switching\nbetween separated and attached flow in the range of angles of attack\n$9.25^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha \\leq 9.6^{\\circ}$; and 3) for the angles of attack\n$\\alpha > 9.6^{\\circ}$, the flow-field and the aerodynamic characteristics are\noverwhelmed by a quasi-periodic and self-sustained LFO until the aerofoil\napproaches the angle of full stall. A trailing-edge bubble (TEB) forms at\n$\\alpha > 9.25^{\\circ}$ and grows with the angle of attack. The LSB and TEB\nmerge and continue to deform until they form an open bubble at $\\alpha =\n10.5^{\\circ}$. On the suction surface of the aerofoil, the pressure\ndistribution shows that the presence of the LSB induces a gradual and continues\nadverse pressure gradient (APG) when the flow is attached. The bursting of the\nbubble causes a gradual and continues favourable pressure gradient (FPG) when\nthe flow is separated. This is indicative that a natural forcing mechanism\nkeeps the flow attached against the APG and separated despite the FPG. The\npresent investigation suggests that most of the observations reported in the\nliterature about the LSB and its associated LFO are neither thresholds nor\nindicators for the inception of the instability, but rather are consequences of\nit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 12:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-13"}

We provide new support for this analogue by analysing a massless\nscalar field on a $(1+1)$-dimensional continuum spacetime with a similar\nquench: an early time Minkowski region is joined at a constant time surface,\nrepresenting the quench, to a late time static region in which left and right\nasymptotically Rindler domains are connected by a smooth negative curvature\nbridge. We show that the quench is energetically mild, and late time static\nobservers, modelled as a derivative-coupling Unruh-DeWitt detector, see\nthermality, in a temperature that equals the Unruh temperature for observers in\nthe asymptotic Rindler domains. The Unruh effect hence prevails, despite the\nenergy injected into the field by the quench and despite the absence of a late\ntime Killing horizon.

We\nstudy robustly preserving various classes of trace properties such as safety,\nof hyperproperties such as noninterference, and of relational hyperproperties\nsuch as trace equivalence.

For relational\nproperties and hyperproperties, which relate the behaviors of multiple\nprograms, our formal definitions of the property classes themselves are novel.\nWe order our criteria by their relative strength and show several collapses and\nseparation results.

Notably, in the magnetosphere of a neutron star, the effect of photon\ncapture by the magnetic field, known in QED as relating to gamma-quanta, is\nextended in axion electrodynamics to include X-ray photons with the result that\na specially polarized part of the heat radiation from the surface is canalized\nalong the magnetic field.

This effect has been usually neglected\ngiven the sensitivity of current surveys, but becomes a severe systematic for\nfuture surveys aiming to provide the first detection of non-zero $M_{\\nu}$. The\neffect can be corrected for by defining the bias with respect to the density\nfield of cold dark matter and baryons instead of the total matter field. In\nthis work, we provide a simple prescription for correctly mitigating the\nneutrino-induced scale-dependent bias effect in a practical way. We clarify a\nnumber of subtleties regarding how to properly implement this correction in the\npresence of redshift-space distortions and non-linear evolution of\nperturbations. We perform a MCMC analysis on simulated galaxy clustering data\nthat match the expected sensitivity of the \\textit{Euclid} survey. We find that\nthe neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias can lead to important shifts in both\nthe inferred mean value of $M_{\\nu}$, as well as its uncertainty. We show how\nthese shifts propagate to other cosmological parameters correlated with\n$M_{\\nu}$, such as the cold dark matter physical density $\\Omega_{cdm} h^2$ and\nthe scalar spectral index $n_s$. In conclusion, we find that correctly\naccounting for the neutrino-induced scale-dependent bias will be of crucial\nimportance for future galaxy clustering analyses. We encourage the cosmology\ncommunity to correctly account for this effect using the simple prescription we\npresent in our work.

In this paper, we consider the min-entropy associated\nto several copies of noisy PR boxes.

We show that this doesn't hold in more\ngeneral scenarios where several noisy PR-boxes are implemented from a single\npair of devices, either used sequentially n times or producing n outcome bits\nin a single run. In this case, the min-entropy per PR-box is smaller than the\nmin-entropy of a single PR-box, and it decreases as the number of copies\nincreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 15:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 12:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 09:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

The unseeded version of this problem, in which\nwe do not know any part of the true correspondence, is a long-standing\nchallenge. For low-rank networks, the problem can be translated into an\nunsupervised point registration problem, in which two point sets generated from\nthe same distribution are matchable by an unknown orthonormal transformation.\nConventional methods generally lack consistency guarantee and are usually\ncomputationally costly.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this problem. Instead of\nsimultaneously estimating the unknown correspondence and orthonormal\ntransformation to match up the two point sets, we match their distributions via\nminimizing our designed loss function capturing the discrepancy between their\nLaplace transforms, thus avoiding the optimization over all possible\ncorrespondences. This dramatically reduces the dimension of the optimization\nproblem from $\\Omega(n^2)$ parameters to $O(d^2)$ parameters, where $d$ is the\nfixed rank, and enables convenient theoretical analysis.

It consists of a growing chain of beads which can\nform bonds with each other as they are transcribed. During the transcription\nprocess, the $\\delta$ most recently produced beads dynamically fold so as to\nmaximize the number of bonds formed, self-assemblying into a shape\nincrementally. The parameter $\\delta$ is called the delay and is related to the\ntranscription rate in nature.\n  This article initiates the study of shape self-assembly using oritatami. A\nshape is a connected set of points in the triangular lattice. We first show\nthat oritatami systems differ fundamentally from tile-assembly systems by\nexhibiting a family of infinite shapes that can be tile-assembled but cannot be\nfolded by any OS. As it is NP-hard in general to determine whether there is an\nOS that folds into (self-assembles) a given finite shape, we explore the\nfolding of upscaled versions of finite shapes. We show that any shape can be\nfolded from a constant size seed, at any scale n >= 3, by an OS with delay 1.\nWe also show that any shape can be folded at the smaller scale 2 by an OS with\nunbounded delay. This leads us to investigate the influence of delay and to\nprove that, for all {\\delta} > 2, there are shapes that can be folded (at scale\n1) with delay {\\delta} but not with delay {\\delta}'<{\\delta}. These results\nserve as a foundation for the study of shape-building in this new model of\nself-assembly, and have the potential to provide better understanding of\ncotranscriptional folding in biology, as well as improved abilities of\nexperimentalists to design artificial systems that self-assemble via this\ncomplex dynamical process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 15:47:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 12:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-16"}

Contrary\nto the common perception which can be gauged from the interchangeable use of\nthese temporal profiles, the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the pairs\ncreated by the two pulses is found to differ significantly in all the temporal\nregimes. For the pulses having a few cycles of oscillations, the temporal\nprofile of the pulse is revealed in the oscillatory interference pattern riding\nover the otherwise smooth longitudinal momentum spectrum at asymptotic times.\nThe onset of the oscillation due to the quantum interference of reflection\namplitudes from the scattering potential due to the pulses having a temporal\nstructure of multiple barriers takes place for few-cycle oscillations for the\nGaussian pulse than that for the Sauter pulse. Furthermore, the oscillation\namplitude for the same number of oscillations within the pulse duration is\nlarger for the Gaussian pulse. The presence of the carrier-envelope phase and\nthe frequency chirping is found to magnify these differences.

In an\nindustrial automation setting, certain areas should be off limits to an\nautomated vehicle for protection of people and high-valued assets. These areas\ncan be quarantined by mapping (e.g., GPS) or via beacons that delineate a\nno-entry area. We propose a delineation method where the industrial vehicle\nutilizes a LiDAR {(Light Detection and Ranging)} and a single color camera to\ndetect passive beacons and model-predictive control to stop the vehicle from\nentering a restricted space. The beacons are standard orange traffic cones with\na highly reflective vertical pole attached. The LiDAR can readily detect these\nbeacons, but suffers from false positives due to other reflective surfaces such\nas worker safety vests. Herein, we put forth a method for reducing false\npositive detection from the LiDAR by projecting the beacons in the camera\nimagery via a deep learning method and validating the detection using a neural\nnetwork-learned projection from the camera to the LiDAR space. Experimental\ndata collected at Mississippi State University's Center for Advanced Vehicular\nSystems (CAVS) shows the effectiveness of the proposed system in keeping the\ntrue detection while mitigating false positives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 16:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

Recently, deep learning approaches have been applied to image\nrecognition field due to the discriminative power of Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN). In this paper, we first propose a novel Multi-Region Ensemble\nCNN (MRE-CNN) framework for facial expression recognition, which aims to\nenhance the learning power of CNN models by capturing both the global and the\nlocal features from multiple human face sub-regions. Second, the weighted\nprediction scores from each sub-network are aggregated to produce the final\nprediction of high accuracy. Third, we investigate the effects of different\nsub-regions of the whole face on facial expression recognition. Our proposed\nmethod is evaluated based on two well-known publicly available facial\nexpression databases: AFEW 7.0 and RAF-DB, and has been shown to achieve the\nstate-of-the-art recognition accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 02:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

To illustrate the power\nof this method, known as control-based continuation (CBC), it is applied to a\nnonlinear beam structure that exhibits a strong 3:1 modal coupling between its\nfirst two bending modes. CBC is able to extract a range of dynamical features,\nincluding an isola, directly from the experiment without recourse to model\nfitting or other indirect data-processing methods.\n  Previously, CBC has only been applied to (essentially)\nsingle-degree-of-freedom experiments; in this paper we show that the required\nfeedback-control methods and path-following techniques can equally be applied\nto MDOF systems. A low-level broadband excitation is initially applied to the\nexperiment to obtain the requisite information for controller design and,\nsubsequently, the physical experiment is treated as a `black box' that is\nprobed using CBC. The invasiveness of the controller used is analysed and\nexperimental results are validated with open-loop measurements. Good agreement\nbetween open- and closed-loop results is achieved, though it is found that care\nneeds to be taken in dealing with the presence of higher-harmonics in the force\napplied to the structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 09:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}
