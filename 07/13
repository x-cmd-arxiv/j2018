We\nshow that a particular discretisation provides an estimate of the von Neumann\nentropy of the one-electron reduced density matrix from the experimentally\naccessible Shannon entropy. For spinless distinguishable electrons the entropy\nis sizeable at low energies, indicating strong momentum entanglement, and drops\nto almost zero at energies of the order of 10 keV when the azimutal degree of\nfreedom is integrated out, i.e. practically no entanglement and almost pure\none-electron states. If spin is taken into account, the entropy for electrons\nwith antiparallel spins should be larger than in the parallel-spin case, since\nit embodies both momentum and spin entanglement. Surprisingly, this difference,\nas well as the deviation from the spin-less case, is extremely small for the\ncomplete scattering state. Strong spin entanglement can however be obtained by\npost-selecting states at scattering angle pi/2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 16:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 16:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

We introduce an auto-encoder architecture, termed constrained recurrent\nsparse auto-encoder (CRsAE), that answers this question in the affirmative.\nGiven an input signal and an approximate dictionary, the encoder finds a sparse\napproximation using FISTA. The decoder reconstructs the signal by applying the\ndictionary to the output of the encoder. The encoder and decoder in CRsAE\nparallel the sparse-coding and dictionary update steps in optimization-based\nalternating-minimization schemes for dictionary learning. As such, the\nparameters of the encoder and decoder are not independent, a constraint which\nwe enforce for the first time. We derive the back-propagation algorithm for\nCRsAE. CRsAE is a framework for blind source separation that, only knowing the\nnumber of sources (dictionary elements), and assuming sparsely-many can\noverlap, is able to separate them.

Recently IMBHs have started to be observed\nat the centers of low-mass galaxies. We perform cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations of $(2 h^{-1} ~ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes and investigate the\ngrowth and feedback of central IMBHs in dwarf galaxies (DGs). The earliest BHs\nappear at $z \\sim 18 - 25$, and grow thereafter by accreting gas and by merger\nwith other BHs. We find that, starting from $10^{2} M_{\\odot}$, it is possible\nto build up IMBHs of a few$\\times 10^{5} - 10^{6} M_{\\odot}$ by $z = 5$, when\nthe BHs are seeded in halos less massive than $4 \\times 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$. The\nBH accretion rates increase with time, and reaches $\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH} = (0.2 -\n0.8) \\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$ for the massive IMBHs by $z = 4$. The star formation\nrate density (SFRD) evolution of the DGs (stellar mass $10^{5} - 10^{8}\nM_{\\odot}$) has a peak plateau between $z = 4 - 6$. Star formation is quenched\nbetween $z = 9 - 4$. The SFRD is reduced by factors up to $3$, when the BHs\nhave grown to a few times $10^5 M_{\\odot}$. Even in the presence of stronger\nSN-driven mass ejection, the BHs continue to grow up to $z \\sim 6$, sustained\nby gas inflows driven by galaxy mergers and interactions in a cosmological\nenvironment. Our conclusions, based on numerical simulation results, support\nthe scenario that early feedback from IMBHs in gas-rich DGs at $z = 5 - 8$ can\npotentially solve several anomalies in the DG mass range within the concordance\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological scenario (Silk 2017).

This developed notion of observability gramian for\nnonlinear flow field combined with the finite dimensional approximation of P-F\noperator is used to provide a systematic procedure for optimal placement of\nsensors under uncertain operating conditions. Simulation results are presented\nto demonstrate the applicability of the developed framework on the IEA-annex 2D\nbenchmark problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 18:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-16"}

In AL one\niteratively selects training examples for annotation, often those for which the\ncurrent model is most uncertain (by some measure). The hope is that active\nsampling leads to better performance than would be achieved under independent\nand identically distributed (i.i.d.) random samples. While AL has shown promise\nin retrospective evaluations, these studies often ignore practical obstacles to\nits use. In this paper we show that while AL may provide benefits when used\nwith specific models and for particular domains, the benefits of current\napproaches do not generalize reliably across models and tasks. This is\nproblematic because in practice one does not have the opportunity to explore\nand compare alternative AL strategies. Moreover, AL couples the training\ndataset with the model used to guide its acquisition. We find that subsequently\ntraining a successor model with an actively-acquired dataset does not\nconsistently outperform training on i.i.d. sampled data. Our findings raise the\nquestion of whether the downsides inherent to AL are worth the modest and\ninconsistent performance gains it tends to afford.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 19:41:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 22:43:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 18:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

It occurs when groups of relatively simple components\nspontaneously combine to form more complex structures. While such systems have\ninspired a large amount of research into designing theoretical models of\nself-assembling systems, and even laboratory-based implementations of them,\nthese artificial models and systems often tend to be lacking in one of the\npowerful features of natural systems (e.g. the assembly and folding of\nproteins), namely the dynamic reconfigurability of structures. In this paper,\nwe present a new mathematical model of self-assembly, based on the abstract\nTile Assembly Model (aTAM), called the Flexible Tile Assembly Model (FTAM). In\nthe FTAM, the individual components are 2-dimensional square tiles as in the\naTAM, but in the FTAM, bonds between the edges of tiles can be flexible,\nallowing bonds to flex and entire structures to reconfigure, thus allowing\n2-dimensional components to form 3-dimensional structures. We analyze the\npowers and limitations of FTAM systems by (1) demonstrating how flexibility can\nbe controlled to carefully build desired structures, and (2) showing how\nflexibility can be beneficially harnessed to form structures which can\n\"efficiently\" reconfigure into many different configurations and/or greatly\nvarying configurations. We also show that with such power comes a heavy burden\nin terms of computational complexity of simulation and prediction by proving\nthat, for important properties of FTAM systems, determining their existence is\nintractable, even for properties which are easily computed for systems in less\ndynamic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 20:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 18:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

A distinguishing feature of\ntimeline-based planning systems is the ability to integrate planning with\nexecution by synthesising control strategies for flexible plans. However,\nflexible plans can only represent temporal uncertainty, while more complex\nforms of nondeterminism are needed to deal with a wider range of realistic\nproblems.

VAEs can capture\ncomplex distributions, but they can also suffer from an issue known as \"latent\nvariable collapse,\" especially if the likelihood model is powerful.\nSpecifically, the lower bound involves an approximate posterior of the latent\nvariables; this posterior \"collapses\" when it is set equal to the prior, i.e.,\nwhen the approximate posterior is independent of the data.

Results: We identify four topics studied in IaC-related\npublications: (i) framework/tool for infrastructure as code; (ii) use of\ninfrastructure as code; (iii) empirical study related to infrastructure as\ncode; and (iv) testing in infrastructure as code. According to our analysis,\n52% of the studied 31 publications propose a framework or tool to implement the\npractice of IaC or extend the functionality of an existing IaC tool.\nConclusion: As defects and security flaws can have serious consequences for the\ndeployment and development environments in DevOps, along with other topics, we\nobserve the need for research studies that will study defects and security\nflaws for IaC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 00:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

For instance, deposition of a highly conductive thin overlayer onto\na dirty superconducting film can give rise to an \"anti-proximity effect\" which\nmanifests itself in an initial increase of $T_r(d_2)$ with the overlayer\nthickness $d_2$ followed by a decrease of $T_r(d_2)$ at larger $d_2$. Such a\nnonmonotonic thickness dependence of $T_r(d_2)$ results from the interplay of\nthe increase of a net superfluid density mitigating phase fluctuations and the\nsuppression of the critical temperature $T_c$ due to the conventional proximity\neffect. This behavior of $T_r(d_2)$ is obtained by solving the Usadel equations\nto calculate the temperature of the Berezinskii-Kosterletz-Thouless transition,\nand the temperature of the resistive transition due to thermally-activated\nhopping of single vortices in dirty bilayers. The theory incorporates relevant\nmaterials parameters such as thicknesses and conductivities of the layers,\ninterface contact resistance between them and the subgap quasiparticle states\nwhich affect both phase fluctuations and the proximity effect suppression of\n$T_c$. The transition temperature $T_r$ can be optimized by tuning the\noverlayer parameters, which can significantly weaken vortex fluctuations and\nnearly restore the mean-field critical temperature. The calculated behavior of\n$T_r(d_2)$ may explain the nonmonotonic dependence of $T_r(d_2)$ observed on\n(Ag, Au, Mg, Zn)-coated Bi films, Ag-coated Ga and Pb films or NbN and NbTiN\nfilms on AlN buffer layers.

AGM (Affiliation Graph Model) is one of the favorite\nmodels for explaining the densely overlapped community structures. In this\npaper, we thoroughly re-investigate the assumptions made by the AGM model on\nreal datasets. We find that the AGM model is not sufficient to explain several\nempirical behaviors observed in popular real-world networks. To our surprise,\nall our experimental results can be explained by a parameter-free hypothesis,\nleading to more straightforward modeling than AGM which has many parameters.\nBased on these findings, we propose a parameter-free Jaccard-based Affiliation\nGraph (JAG) model which models the probability of edge as a network specific\nconstant times the Jaccard similarity between community sets associated with\nthe individuals. Our modeling is significantly simpler than AGM, and it\neliminates the need of associating a parameter, the probability value, with\neach community. Furthermore, JAG model naturally explains why (and in fact\nwhen) overlapping communities are densely connected. Based on these\nobservations, we propose a new community-driven friendship formation process,\nwhich mathematically recovers the JAG model. JAG is the first model that points\ntowards a direct causal relationship between tight connections in the given\ncommunity with the number of overlapping communities inside it. Thus, \\emph{the\nmost effective way to bring a community together is to form more\nsub-communities within it.} The community detection algorithm based on our\nmodeling demonstrates a significantly simple algorithm with state-of-the-art\naccuracy on six real-world network datasets compared to the existing link\nanalysis based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 04:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-16"}

Identifying attributes in a query is a critical component in\nconnecting users to relevant items. However, in many cases, the queries have\nmultiple attributes, and some of them will be in conflict with each other. For\nexample, the query \"maroon 5 dvds\" has two candidate attributes, the color\n\"maroon\" or the band \"maroon 5\", where only one of the attributes can be\npresent. In this paper, we address the problem of resolving conflicting\nattributes in e-commerce queries. A challenge in this problem is that knowledge\nbases like Wikipedia that are used to understand web queries are not focused on\nthe e-commerce domain. E-commerce search engines, however, have access to the\ncatalog which contains detailed information about the items and its attributes.\nWe propose a framework that constructs knowledge graphs from catalog to resolve\nconflicting attributes in e-commerce queries. Our experiments on real-world\nqueries on e-commerce platforms demonstrate that resolving conflicting\nattributes by leveraging catalog information significantly improves attribute\nidentification, and also gives out more relevant search results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 05:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-16"}

As such, interpretations of exoplanet spectra strongly depend on\nthe choice of cloud model, many of which are highly simplified and lack\npredictive power. In this work, we use a cloud model that treat microphysical\nprocesses to simulate potassium chloride (KCl) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) clouds in\nthe atmosphere of the super Earth GJ 1214b and how they vary as a function of\nthe strength of vertical mixing and the atmospheric metallicity. Microphysical\nprocesses control the size and spatial distribution of cloud particles,\nallowing for the computation of more physical cloud distributions than simpler\nmodels. We find that the mass and opacity of KCl clouds increase with mixing\nstrength and metallicity, with the particle size and spatial distribution\ndefined by nucleation, condensation, evaporation, and transport timescales. ZnS\nclouds cannot form without the presence of condensation nuclei, while\nheterogeneous nucleation of ZnS on KCl reduces particle sizes compared to pure\nKCl cases. In order to explain the flat transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b with\nhomogeneously nucleated KCl clouds, the atmospheric metallicity must be at\nleast 1000 $\\times$ solar, and the eddy diffusivity must be at least 10$^{10}$\ncm$^2$ s$^{-1}$.

In the design study of a transmutation system using a deuteron primary\nbeam, accurate cross section data of deuteron-induced reactions on the LLFPs\nare indispensable. Reliable model predictions play an important role in\ncompleting the necessary cross section data since currently available\nexperimental data are very limited. Under the circumstances, we have been\ndeveloping a code system dedicated for deuteron-induced reactions, which is\ncalled DEURACS. Aiming to predict the production cross sections of residual\nnuclei, the purpose of the present work is to clarify a role of deuteron\nbreakup processes in deuteron-induced spallation reactions at intermediate\nenergies. Isotopic production cross sections of residual nuclei in the\ndeuteron-induced reactions on 93Zr and 107Pd at 100-200 MeV/nucleon are\nanalyzed using DEURACS, in which the breakup processes are explicitly taken\ninto account. The calculated cross sections are decomposed into individual\ncomponents corresponding to the absorption of either neutron or proton in the\nincident deuteron, or the deuteron itself. The calculated cross sections\nreproduced the experimental data well over a wide mass number range of residual\nnuclei. From a component-by-component analysis, it was found that the\ncomponents of nucleon absorption have the significant contributions to the\nproduction of residual nuclei. Consideration of the breakup processes is\nessential to predict the production cross sections of residual nuclei in\ndeuteron-induced reactions. The framework of DEURACS is applicable to\ndeuteron-induced spallation reactions at intermediate energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 09:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The present\narticle addresses the rotational structure properties of the\ntetrahedrally-symmetric even-even core configurations coupled with a single\nvalence nucleon.

Although the spectrum is generally more complicated for\none-particle occupying a 4-fold degenerate orbital belonging to the $G_{3/2}$\nrepresentation, an appearance of the correlated double-sequence structures\npersists. The spectra of the doubly-magic tetrahedral core plus one-particle\nsystems can be well interpreted using the analytical solutions of the first\norder Coriolis-coupling Hamiltonian.

For a reasonable choice of parameters, thermal inflation\nmodels naturally predict a suppression of the matter power spectrum on galactic\nand sub-galactic scales, mimicking the effect of warm or interacting dark\nmatter. Matter power spectra in these models are also characterised by an\nexcess of power (w.r.t. the standard $\\Lambda$CDM power spectrum) just below\nthe suppression scale. By running a suite of N-body simulations we investigate\nthe non-linear growth of structure in models of thermal inflation. We measure\nthe non-linear matter power spectrum and extract halo statistics, such as the\nhalo mass function, and compare these quantities with those predicted in the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and in other models with damped matter\nfluctuations. We find that the thermal inflation models considered here produce\nmeasurable differences in the matter power spectrum from $\\Lambda$CDM at\nredshifts $z>5$, while the halo mass functions are appreciably different at all\nredshifts. The halo mass function at $z=0$ for thermal inflation displays an\nenhancement of around $\\sim 20\\%$ w.r.t. $\\Lambda$CDM and a damping at lower\nhalo masses, with the position of the enhancement depending on the value of the\nfree parameter in the model.

One standard tool of exploring the underlying dependence\nstructure present in multiple quantitative data sets is simultaneous component\nanalysis (SCA) model.

To this end, we propose the generalized SCA (GSCA) model,\nwhich takes into account the distinct mathematical properties of binary and\nquantitative measurements in the maximum likelihood framework.

For $m, n \\ge\n4$, the relation between Properties $P(m)$ and $Q(n)$ is closely related to a\nwell-documented open problem in additive combinatorics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 10:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 07:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 21:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-21"}

First,\nwe run a replication of Niedermayr's study with 28K+ methods, enhancing its\nexternal validity thanks to the use of new tools and new study subjects.\nSecond, we perform a systematic characterization of these methods, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively with an extensive manual analysis of 101\npseudo-tested methods. The first part of the study confirms Niedermayr's\nresults: pseudo-tested methods exist in all our subjects. Our in-depth\ncharacterization of pseudotested methods leads to two key insights:\npseudo-tested methods are significantly less tested than the other methods;\nyet, for most of them, the developers would not pay the testing price to fix\nthis situation. This calls for future work on targeted test generation to\nspecify those pseudo-tested methods without spending developer time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 12:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 21:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

As a\nmatter of fact, birth reduction may even start several months before the death\nsurge and can therefore serve as an early warning signal of an impending\ncrisis. This scenario is studied in three cases of large-scale food crises.\nFinland (1868), India (1867--1907), China (1960--1961).

Researchers have long relied on DRAM power\nmodels that are based off of standardized current measurements provided by\nvendors, called IDD values. Unfortunately, we find that these models are highly\ninaccurate, and do not reflect the actual power consumed by real DRAM devices.\n  We perform the first comprehensive experimental characterization of the power\nconsumed by modern real-world DRAM modules. Our extensive characterization of\n50 DDR3L DRAM modules from three major vendors yields four key new observations\nabout DRAM power consumption: (1) across all IDD values that we measure, the\ncurrent consumed by real DRAM modules varies significantly from the current\nspecified by the vendors; (2) DRAM power consumption strongly depends on the\ndata value that is read or written; (3) there is significant structural\nvariation, where the same banks and rows across multiple DRAM modules from the\nsame model consume more power than other banks or rows; and (4) over successive\nprocess technology generations, DRAM power consumption has not decreased by as\nmuch as vendor specifications have indicated.\n  Based on our detailed analysis and characterization data, we develop the\nVariation-Aware model of Memory Power Informed by Real Experiments (VAMPIRE).\nWe show that VAMPIRE has a mean absolute percentage error of only 6.8% compared\nto actual measured DRAM power. VAMPIRE enables a wide range of studies that\nwere not possible using prior DRAM power models. As an example, we use VAMPIRE\nto evaluate a new power-aware data encoding mechanism, which can reduce DRAM\nenergy consumption by an average of 12.2%.

The prescriptive power of heuristics is documented in a\ncross-disciplinary literature, cutting across medicine, crime, business,\nsports, and other domains. We outline the fast-and-frugal heuristics research\nprogram, provide examples of past empirical work on heuristics outside the\nfield of bibliometrics, explain why heuristics may be especially suitable for\nstudying the usage of bibliometrics, and propose a corresponding conceptual\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 14:53:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 08:39:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 14:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 06:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

At this shock, H+ PUIs are only a few\npercent of the total proton density but contain most of the internal particle\npressure. A gradual reduction in SW flow speed and simultaneous heating of H+\nSWIs is observed ahead of the shock, suggesting an upstream energetic particle\npressure gradient. H+ SWIs lose ~85% of their energy flux across the shock and\nH+ PUIs are preferentially heated. Moreover, a PUI tail is observed downstream\nof the shock, such that the energy flux of all H+ PUIs is approximately six\ntimes that of H+ SWIs. We find that H+ PUIs, including their suprathermal tail,\ncontain almost half of the total downstream energy flux in the shock frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 15:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

This allows 3D NAND flash memory to increase storage\ndensity using a much less aggressive manufacturing process technology than\nplanar NAND flash memory. The circuit-level and structural changes in 3D NAND\nflash memory significantly alter how different error sources affect the\nreliability of the memory.\n  In this paper, through experimental characterization of real,\nstate-of-the-art 3D NAND flash memory chips, we find that 3D NAND flash memory\nexhibits three new error sources that were not previously observed in planar\nNAND flash memory: (1) layer-to-layer process variation, where the average\nerror rate of each 3D-stacked layer in a chip is significantly different; (2)\nearly retention loss, a new phenomenon where the number of errors due to charge\nleakage increases quickly within several hours after programming; and (3)\nretention interference, a new phenomenon where the rate at which charge leaks\nfrom a flash cell is dependent on the data value stored in the neighboring\ncell.\n  Based on our experimental results, we develop new analytical models of\nlayer-to-layer process variation and retention loss in 3D NAND flash memory.\nMotivated by our new findings and models, we develop four new techniques to\nmitigate process variation and early retention loss in 3D NAND flash memory.\nThese four techniques are complementary, and can be combined together to\nsignificantly improve flash memory reliability.

This problem has been widely investigated in Economics, when the\ncommunication channel is perfect.

This approach radically differs from the conventional\nCommunication paradigm, which assumes transmitters are of two types: either\nthey have a common goal, or they act as opponent, e.g. jammer, eavesdropper. We\nformulate a point-to-point source-channel coding problem with state\ninformation, in which the encoder and the decoder choose their respective\nencoding and decoding strategies in order to maximize their long-run utility\nfunctions. This strategic coding problem is at the interplay between\nWyner-Ziv's scenario and the Bayesian persuasion game of Kamenica-Gentzkow. We\ncharacterize a single-letter solution and we relate it to the previous results\nby using the concavification method. This confirms the benefit of sending\nencoded data bits even if the decoding process is not supervised, e.g. when the\ndecoder is an autonomous device.

The brain is able to learn the dynamic nature of the\nphysical world via experience; analogously, artificial neural systems can learn\nthe long-term behavior of complex dynamical systems from data. Yet, precisely\nhow this implicit learning occurs remains unknown. Here, we draw inspiration\nfrom human neuroscience and from reservoir computing to propose a\nfirst-principles framework explicating putative mechanisms of implicit\nlearning. Specifically, we show that an arbitrary dynamical system implicitly\nlearns other dynamical attractors by embedding them into its own phase space\nthrough invertible generalized synchronization. By sustaining the embedding\nthrough fine-tuned feedback loops, the arbitrary dynamical system can imitate\nthe attractor dynamics it has learned. To evaluate the mechanism's relevance,\nwe construct several distinct neural network models that adaptively learn and\nimitate multiple attractors. We observe and explain the emergence of 5 distinct\nphenomena reminiscent of cognitive functions: (i) imitating a dynamical system\npurely from learning the time series, (ii) learning multiple attractors by a\nsingle system, (iii) switching among the imitations of multiple attractors,\neither spontaneously or driven by external cues, (iv) filling-in missing\nvariables from incomplete observations of a learned dynamical system, and (v)\ndeciphering superimposed input from different dynamical systems.

The problem\nmanifests itself as remnant images that can persist for several days after a\ndeep exposure. In this study, the persistence behavior of three 5.3um cutoff\nH2RGs has been characterised using a low-background cryostat with LED light\nsources. Persistence charge de-trapping was measured over several hours\nfollowing a wide range of exposure levels and exposure times. This data was\nthen analysed to yield charge trapping and de-trapping spectra which present\ngraphically the trap density as a function of their time constants. These\nspectra show the detector behavior in a very direct way and offer a natural\nmetric for comparing different devices. It is hoped that the trap time constant\nspectra for each detector can be used in an analysis pipeline to remove\npersistence artifacts based on the recent exposure history of the detector. The\nstudy confirmed that the charge traps responsible for persistence must be\npresent in the depletion region of the pixel, however, two trap populations\nwere revealed. One of these captures charge within milliseconds and then\nreleases it over many hours. The second population is less problematic with\nfairly similar trapping and de-trapping time constants. Large differences in\npersistence magnitude and trap spectra have been found even between devices\nwith near-consecutive serial numbers. Lower temperatures resulted in lower\npersistence both in terms of total trapped charge and the time taken for that\ncharge to decay. Limiting the full-well by reducing pixel bias voltage also had\na beneficial effect. Previously proposed mitigation techniques including\n\"global reset de-trapping\" and \"night light\" illumination were tried but found\nto be ineffective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

While the interaction of multisensory cues according\nto their spatiotemporal properties and the formation of multisensory\nfeature-based representations have been widely studied, the interaction of\nspatial-associative neural representations has received considerably less\nattention. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that models\nthe interaction of spatial-associative representations to perform causal\ninference of audiovisual stimuli. We investigate the spatial alignment of\nexogenous audiovisual stimuli modulated by associative congruence. In the\nspatial layer, topographically arranged networks account for the interaction of\naudiovisual input in terms of population codes. In the associative layer,\ncongruent audiovisual representations are obtained via the experience-driven\ndevelopment of feature-based associations. Levels of congruency are obtained as\na by-product of the neurodynamics of self-organizing networks, where the amount\nof neural activation triggered by the input can be expressed via a nonlinear\ndistance function. Our novel proposal is that activity-driven levels of\ncongruency can be used as top-down modulatory projections to spatially\ndistributed representations of sensory input, e.g. semantically related\naudiovisual pairs will yield a higher level of integration than unrelated\npairs. Furthermore, levels of neural response in unimodal layers may be seen as\nsensory reliability for the dynamic weighting of crossmodal cues.

In these cases we study\nthe offshellness effects in pair-production and decay and show that if the\nNarrow-Width Approximation (NWA) is a good approximation of the full result in\nthe small width over mass ratio limit, sizeable differences occur when the XQ\nwidth becomes larger. The conclusion of our analysis is that even though the\nsmall width assumption is always conservative it is not possible to trivially\nrescale the mass bounds obtained considering processes of pair production and\ndecay in the NWA to determine constraints for XQs with large widths. We also\nstudy the role of interference in the process of pair production of new heavy\nXQs decaying to SM particles and show that in the NWA the interference\ncontribution can be described by considering a parameter which contains only\nthe relevant couplings and the scalar part of the propagators of the new\nquarks, both at the cross section level and at the distribution level. Finally,\nwe study how various SUSY searches perform for our simplified model with XQs\ndecaying to DM. We show that the bound for XQs can be obtained from the SUSY\nones just by rescaling the exclusion with the XQ cross section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 14:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

Human analysts are essential to exploring and quantifying this\nprocess, but they are limited by their inability to process the volume,\nvariety, velocity, and veracity of data. Visualization tools are essential for\nhelping this human-computer interaction. For example, analytical tools that use\ngraphical linknode visualization can help sift through vast amounts of\ninformation. However, assisting the analyst in making connections with visual\ntools can be challenging if the information is not presented in an intuitive\nmanner.\n  Experimentally, it has been shown that analysts increase the number of\nhypotheses formed if they use visual analytic capabilities. Exploring multiple\nperspectives could increase the diversity of those hypotheses, potentially\nminimizing cognitive biases. In this paper, we discuss preliminary research\nresults that indicate an improvement in sensemaking over the traditional\nlink-node visualization tools by incorporating an annotation enhancement that\ndifferentiates links connecting nodes. This enhancement assists by providing a\nvisual cue, which represents the perceived value of reported information.

More precisely, a\nset of weight vectors is employed to decompose a given many-objective\noptimization problem(MaOP), and a hybrid method of the penalty-based boundary\nintersection function and dominance is proposed to compare local solutions\nwithin a subpopulation defined by a weight vector. A MOEA based on the hybrid\nmethod is implemented and tested on problems chosen from two famous test\nsuites, i.e., DTLZ and WFG.

It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are physical\nreactions to sudden, usually brief, excessive electrical discharges in a group\nof brain cells. Hence, seizure identification has great importance in clinical\ntherapy of epileptic patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the main\nbiomarker that can measure voltage fluctuations of the brain and EEG data\nanalysis helps to investigate the patient with epilepsy syndrome as epilepsy\nleaves their signature in EEG signals. In this paper, the Discrete Wavelet\nTransform (DWT) is applied to EEG signals to pre-processing, decompose it till\nthe 4th level of decomposition tree.Various features like Entropy, Min, Max,\nMean, Median, Standard deviation, Variance, Skewness, Energy and Relative Wave\nEnergy (RWE) were computed in terms of detailed coefficients and the\napproximation coefficients of the last decomposition level.Then, the extracted\nfeatures are evaluated by three modern machine-learning classifiers such as\nRadial Basis Function based Support Vector Machine (SVMRBF), k-Nearest Neighbor\n(KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB). The experimental results demonstrate that the\nhighest classification accuracy (100\\%) for normal subject data versus\nepileptic data is obtained by SVMRBF. the corresponding accuracy between normal\nsubject data and epileptic data using KNN and NB is obtained as 99.50\\% and\n99\\% for the eyes open and eyes closed conditions, respectively.
