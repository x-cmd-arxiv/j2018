Similarly, any exchangeable composition (i.e. ordered partition\nof $\\mathbb{N}$) can be represented as a paintbox based on an\ninterval-partition (Gnedin 1997). Our first main result is that any\nexchangeable coalescent process (not necessarily Markovian) can be represented\nas a paintbox based on a random non-decreasing process valued in\ninterval-partitions, called nested interval-partition, generalizing the notion\nof comb metric space introduced by Lambert & Uribe Bravo (2017) to represent\ncompact ultrametric spaces. As a special case, we show that any\n$\\Lambda$-coalescent can be obtained from a paintbox based on a unique random\nnested interval partition called $\\Lambda$-comb, which is Markovian with\nexplicit transitions. This nested interval-partition directly relates to the\nflow of bridges of Bertoin & Le Gall (2003). We also display a particularly\nsimple description of the so-called evolving coalescent (Pfaffelhuber &\nWakolbinger 2006) by a comb-valued Markov process. Next, we prove that any\nmeasured ultrametric space $U$, under mild measure-theoretic assumptions on\n$U$, is the leaf set of a tree composed of a separable subtree called the\nbackbone, on which are grafted additional subtrees, which act as star-trees\nfrom the standpoint of sampling.

Similar to CSPs, the tractability of promise CSPs can be tied\nto the structure of operations on the solution space called polymorphisms,\nthough in the promise world these operations are much less constrained. Under\nthe thesis that non-trivial polymorphisms govern tractability, promise CSPs\ntherefore provide a fertile ground for the discovery of novel algorithms.\n  In previous work, we classified Boolean promise CSPs when the constraint\npredicates are symmetric. In this work, we vastly generalize these algorithmic\nresults. Specifically, we show that promise CSPs that admit a family of\n\"regional-periodic\" polymorphisms are in P, assuming that determining which\nregion a point is in can be computed in polynomial time. Such polymorphisms are\nquite general and are obtained by gluing together several functions that are\nperiodic in the Hamming weights in different blocks of the input.\n  Our algorithm is based on a novel combination of linear programming and\nsolving linear systems over rings. We also abstract a framework based on\nreducing a promise CSP to a CSP over an infinite domain, solving it there, and\nthen rounding the solution to an assignment for the promise CSP instance. The\nrounding step is intimately tied to the family of polymorphisms and clarifies\nthe connection between polymorphisms and algorithms in this context. As a key\ningredient, we introduce the technique of finding a solution to a linear\nprogram with integer coefficients that lies in a different ring (such as\n$\\mathbb Z[\\sqrt{2}]$) to bypass ad-hoc adjustments for lying on a rounding\nboundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 17:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-16"}

To solve this model by\nmeans of SoV we use an algebraic Vertex-IRF gauge transformation reducing one\nof the boundary K-matrices to a diagonal form. As usual within the SoV\napproach, the scalar products of separate states are computed in terms of\ndressed Vandermonde determinants having an intricate dependency on the\ninhomogeneity parameters. We show that these determinants can be transformed\ninto different ones in which the homogeneous limit can be taken\nstraightforwardly.

Considering a special choice of the boundary parameters\nrelevant in the thermodynamic limit to describe the half infinite chain with a\ngeneral boundary, we particularize these representations to the case of one of\nthe two states being an eigenstate.

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data.

The two\nmost promising effective models for early universe cosmology, inflation and\nekpyrosis, are mechanisms that, in order to address cosmological puzzles, must\noperate over vast expansion/energy ranges. This suggests that it might be\nappropriate to describe them using scaling laws. Here we combine these two\nideas and demonstrate that they drive inflation and ekpyrosis to their\nextremes: inflation must start at ultra-slow-roll, and ekpyrosis at\nultra-fast-roll. At face value, the implied spectra are overly tilted to the\nred, although in both cases minor departures from pure scale freedom bring the\nspectral indices within current observational bounds. These models predict a\nsignificant spectral running at a level detectable in the near future\n($\\alpha_s \\approx -10^{-3}$).

We investigate the efficacy of\nGreyFiber with a prototype implementation deployed in the GENI and CloudLab\ntestbeds. Our scaling experiments show that 50 circuits can be provisioned\nwithin a minute. We also show that backup paths can be provisioned 28 times\nfaster than an OSPF-based solution during failure/maintenance events. Our\nexperiments also examine GreyFiber overhead demands and show that the time\nspent in circuit creation is dependent on the network infrastructure,\nindicating avenues for future improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 18:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

With regard to the\nquestion above, our prior results indicate that it is often the case that there\nare no performance benefits associated with high-frequency trading. In the\npresent paper, we generalize the analysis to portfolios with multiple risky\nassets. We show that if there is an asset satisfying a new condition which we\ncall dominance, then an optimal portfolio consists of this asset alone; i.e.,\nthe trader has \"all eggs in one basket\" and performance becomes a constant\nfunction of rebalancing frequency. Said another way, the problem of rebalancing\nis rendered moot. The paper also includes simulations which address practical\nconsiderations associated with real stock prices and the dominant asset\ncondition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 19:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

In this paper, we quantify the effectiveness of PS in\ntwo contexts which are relevant for M dwarfs. First, using photons from an M\ndwarf in its quiescent non-flaring state, we find that PS on an M dwarf planet\nin the HZ of its parent star is less effective than on Earth by a factor of 10\nfor a flare star with mid-M spectral type. For a flare star with late-M\nspectral type, PS effectiveness is smaller than on Earth by a factor of 100 or\nmore. Second, using photons which are incident on the HZ planet during flares,\nwe find that PS effectiveness can increase by factors of 5-20 above the\nquiescent values. In the case of a flare star with mid-M spectral type, we find\nthat the PS effectiveness during a flare can increase up to as much as 50-60\npercent of the values on Earth. However, for a late-M flare star, even during\nflares, the PS effectiveness remains almost one order of magnitude smaller than\non Earth. We suggest that for biological processes on M dwarf planets, the\nstellar activity cycle may replace the orbital period as the year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 19:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Chauvenet rejection is one of the\noldest, and simplest, ways to account for this, but, like sigma clipping,\ndepends on the sample's mean and standard deviation, neither of which are\nrobust quantities: Both are easily contaminated by the very outliers they are\nbeing used to reject. Many, more robust measures of central tendency, and of\nsample deviation, exist, but each has a tradeoff with precision. Here, we\ndemonstrate that outlier rejection can be both very robust and very precise if\ndecreasingly robust but increasingly precise techniques are applied in\nsequence. To this end, we present a variation on Chauvenet rejection that we\ncall \"robust\" Chauvenet rejection (RCR), which uses three decreasingly\nrobust/increasingly precise measures of central tendency, and four decreasingly\nrobust/increasingly precise measures of sample deviation. We show this\nsequential approach to be very effective for a wide variety of contaminant\ntypes, even when a significant -- even dominant -- fraction of the sample is\ncontaminated, and especially when the contaminants are strong.

One of the fundamental issues in neural networks is overfitting\nwhich is the issue tackled in this thesis. Such problem often occurs when the\ntraining of large models is performed using few training samples. Many\napproaches have been proposed to prevent the network from overfitting and\nimprove its generalization performance such as data augmentation, early\nstopping, parameters sharing, unsupervised learning, dropout, batch\nnormalization, etc.\n  In this thesis, we tackle the neural network overfitting issue from a\nrepresentation learning perspective by considering the situation where few\ntraining samples are available which is the case of many real world\napplications.

Thus there are currently three empirical data that\npoint to supersymmetry as an underlying symmetry of particle physics: the\nunification of gauge couplings within supersymmetry, the fact that nature\nrespects the supersymmetry prediction that the Higgs boson mass lie below 130\nGeV, and vacuum stability up to the Planck scale with a Higgs boson mass at\n$\\sim 125$ GeV while the standard model does not do that. Coupled with the fact\nthat supersymmetry solves the big hierarchy problem related to the quadratic\ndivergence to the Higgs boson mass square along with the fact that there is no\nalternative paradigm that allows us to extrapolate physics from the electroweak\nscale to the grand unification scale consistent with experiment, supersymmetry\nremains a compelling framework for new physics beyond the standard model. The\nlarge loop correction to the Higgs boson mass in supersymmetry to lift the tree\nmass to the experimentally observable value, indicates a larger value of the\nscale of weak scale supersymmetry, making the observation of sparticles more\nchallenging but still within reach at the LHC for the lightest ones.

For weak pair-hopping the phase diagram contains a line of\nLifshitz points where vanishing superfluid stiffness induces a continuous\nchange to a long wavelength Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state.

The corresponding relation is\ncharacterized by a power-law profile, $M_Z \\propto M_p^{3/5}$. We develop a\nsimplified, but physically motivated analysis to investigate how the power-law\nprofile can be produced under the current picture of planet formation. Making\nuse of the existing semi-analytical formulae of accretion rates of pebbles and\nplanetesimals, our analysis shows that the relation can be reproduced well if\nit traces the final stage of planet formation. In the stage, planets accrete\nsolids from gapped planetesimal disks and gas accretion is limited by disk\nevolution. We also find that dust accretion accompanying with gas accretion\ndoes not contribute to $M_Z$ for planets with $M_p < 10^3 M_{\\oplus}$.

Accurate recovery of the 21 cm signal will require precise calibration\nof the array, and several new avenues for calibration have been pursued in\nrecent years, including methods using redundancy in the antenna configuration.\nThe newly upgraded Phase II of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is the first\ninterferometer that has large numbers of redundant baselines while retaining\ngood instantaneous UV-coverage. This array therefore provides a unique\nopportunity to compare redundant calibration with sky-model based algorithms.\nIn this paper, we present the first results from comparing both calibration\napproaches with MWA Phase II observations. For redundant calibration, we use\nthe package OMNICAL, and produce sky-based calibration solutions with the\nanalysis package Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD). There are three\nprincipal results. (1) We report the success of OMNICAL on observations of\nORBComm satellites, showing substantial agreement between redundant visibility\nmeasurements after calibration. (2) We directly compare OMNICAL calibration\nsolutions with those from FHD, and demonstrate these two different calibration\nschemes give extremely similar results. (3) We explore improved calibration by\ncombining OMNICAL and FHD. We evaluate these combined methods using power\nspectrum techniques developed for EoR analysis and find evidence for marginal\nimprovements mitigating artifacts in the power spectrum. These results are\nlikely limited by signal-to-noise in the six hours of data used, but suggest\nfuture directions for combining these two calibration schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2018 00:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The laminar simulations are carried\nout for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, Bingham numbers and ratios of the\nfluid and total viscosity, while the turbulent flow simulations are performed\nat a fixed bulk Reynolds number equal to 2800 and weak elasticity. We show that\nin the laminar flow regime the friction factor increases monotonically with the\nBingham number (yield stress) and decreases with the viscosity ratio, while in\nthe turbulent regime the the friction factor is almost independent of the\nviscosity ratio and decreases with the Bingham number, until the flow\neventually returns to a fully laminar condition for large enough yield\nstresses.

Here, we study diffusion in two-dimensional periodic channels whose\ncross-section presents singular points, such as abrupt changes of radius or the\npresence of thin walls, with openings, delimiting periodic compartments\ncomposing the channel. Dispersion in such systems is analyzed using the\nFick-Jacobs' approximation. This approximation assumes a much faster\nequilibration in the lateral than in the axial direction, along which the\ndispersion is measured. If the characteristic width $a$ of the channel is much\nsmaller than the period $L$ of the channel, i.e. $\\varepsilon = a/L$ is small,\nthis assumption is clearly valid for Brownian particles. For discontinuous\nchannels, the Fick-Jacobs' approximation is only valid at the lowest order in\n$\\varepsilon$ and provides a rough, though on occasions rather accurate,\nestimate of the effective diffusivity.

Servers in the same group are homogeneous. A\nscheduling policy determines the number of working servers (servers that are\nturned on) in each group at every state $n$ (number of customers in the\nsystem). Our goal is to find the optimal scheduling policy to minimize the\nlong-run average cost, which consists of an increasing convex holding cost and\na linear operating cost. We use the sensitivity-based optimization theory to\ncharacterize the optimal policy. A necessary and sufficient condition of the\noptimal policy is derived. We also prove that the optimal policy has monotone\nstructures and a quasi bang-bang control is optimal.

The corresponding\nrelative event rate between PISNe and core collapse supernovae is estimated to\nbe $\\sim$1% for the present-day initial mass function. However, no confident\nPISN candidate has been detected so far, despite more than 1,000 supernovae are\ndiscovered every recent years.

The second result is\nthe high explodability for a massive VMS, i.e., a star with high $X$(C)/$X$(O)\nexplodes with a smaller explosion energy. Consequently, the initial and the CO\ncore mass ranges for PISNe are significantly increased. Finally, a PISN with\nhigh $X$(C)/$X$(O) yields smaller amount of $^{56}$Ni.

Unsatisfactorily, all current $\\text{poly} (\\log \\log n)$-round MPC\nalgorithms seem to get fundamentally stuck at the linear-memory barrier: their\nefficiency crucially relies on each machine having space at least linear in the\nnumber $n$ of nodes. As this might not only be prohibitively large, but also\nallows for easy if not trivial solutions for sparse graphs, we are interested\nin the low-memory MPC model, where the space per machine is restricted to be\nstrongly sublinear, that is, $n^{\\delta}$ for any $0<\\delta<1$.\n  We devise a degree reduction technique that reduces maximal matching and\nmaximal independent set in graphs with arboricity $\\lambda$ to the\ncorresponding problems in graphs with maximum degree $\\text{poly}(\\lambda)$ in\n$O(\\log^2 \\log n)$ rounds. This gives rise to $O\\left(\\log^2\\log n +\nT(\\text{poly} \\lambda)\\right)$-round algorithms, where $T(\\Delta)$ is the\n$\\Delta$-dependency in the round complexity of maximal matching and maximal\nindependent set in graphs with maximum degree $\\Delta$.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel method that seeks to predict the 3d position of the hand using\nboth synthetic and partially-labeled real data. Accordingly, we form a shared\nlatent space between three modalities: synthetic depth image, real depth image,\nand pose.

As such,\nwe show that our method produces accurate predictions in both semi-supervised\nand unsupervised settings.

Special attention\nis paid to the impact of the well width on the results. All calculations have\nbeen carried out in the framework of atomistic tight-binding theory. Our\ntheoretical investigations show that independent of the here studied well\nwidths, carrier localization effects due to built-in fields, well width\nfluctuations and random alloy fluctuations dominate over Coulomb effects in\nterms of charge density redistributions. However, the situation is less clear\ncut when the well width fluctuations are absent. For large well width (approx.\n> 2.5 nm) charge density redistributions are possible but the electronic and\noptical properties are basically dominated by the spatial out-of plane carrier\nseparation originating from the electrostatic built-in field. The situation\nchanges for lower well width (< 2.5 nm) where the Coulomb effect can lead to\nsignificant charge density redistributions and thus might compensate a large\nfraction of the spatial in-plane wave function separation observed in a\nsingle-particle picture.

Integrating the matched 2D\nkeypoints with corresponding depth values, a set of 3D matched keypoints are\nconstructed to calibrate multiple RGB-D cameras. Experiments validated the\naccuracy and efficiency of the proposed calibration approach, both superior to\nthose of existing methods (800 ms vs. 5 seconds; rotation error of 0.56 degrees\nvs. 1.6 degrees; and translation error of 1.80 cm vs. 2.5 cm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2018 12:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 14:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 12:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

It is this underlying scaling\nstructure that makes human activities predictable, albeit in the sense of\ncollective rather than individual human moving behavior. This topological\nanalysis has not yet received its deserved attention in the literature, as many\nresearchers continue to rely on segment analysis for predicting human\nactivities. The segment-analysis-based methods are essentially geometric, with\na focus on geometric details of locations, lengths, and directions, and are\nunable to reveal the scaling property, which means they cannot be used for\nhuman activities prediction. We conducted a series of case studies using London\nstreets and tweet location data, based on related concepts such as natural\nstreets, and natural street segments (or street segments for short), axial\nlines, and axial line segments (or line segments for short). We found that\nnatural streets are the best representation in terms of human activities or\ntraffic prediction, followed by axial lines, and that neither street segments\nnor line segments bear a good correlation between network parameters and tweet\nlocations. These findings point to the fact that the reason why axial\nlines-based space syntax, or the kind of topological analysis in general, works\nhas little to do with individual human travel behavior or ways that human\nconceptualize distances or spaces. Instead, it is the underlying scaling\nhierarchy of streets - numerous least-connected, a very few most-connected, and\nsome in between the least- and most-connected - that makes human activities\npredictable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 18:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}
