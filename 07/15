A key goal in our design is to make\nthe revolving areas as economical as possible and in particular to allow\ndifferent revolving areas to overlap.

The notion of stable or\nperturbation resilient instances was introduced by Bilu and Linial [2010] and\nAwasthi et al. [2012]. In our context we say a k-Means instance is\n\\alpha-stable if there is a unique OPT solution which remains unchanged if\ndistances are (non-uniformly) stretched by a factor of at most \\alpha. Stable\nclustering instances have been studied to explain why heuristics such as\nLloyd's algorithm perform well in practice. In this work we show that for any\nfixed \\epsilon>0, (1+\\epsilon)-stable instances of k-Means in doubling metrics\ncan be solved in polynomial time. More precisely we show a natural multiswap\nlocal search algorithm in fact finds the OPT solution for (1+\\epsilon)-stable\ninstances of k-Means and k-Median in a polynomial number of iterations. We\ncomplement this result by showing that under a plausible PCP hypothesis this is\nessentially tight: that when the dimension d is part of the input, there is a\nfixed \\epsilon_0>0 s.t. there is not even a PTAS for (1+\\epsilon_0)-stable\nk-Means in R^d unless NP=RP.

A mixture model with $K$ mixture components and $L$ observed\nvariables is considered, where each variable takes its value in a finite set\nwith cardinality $M$.The variables are independent in each mixture component.\nThe identifiability of a mixture model means the possibility of attaining the\nmixture components parameters by observing its mixture distribution. In this\npaper, we investigate fundamental relations between the identifiability of\nmixture models and the separability of their observed variables by introducing\ntwo types of separability: strongly and weakly separable variables. Roughly\nspeaking, a variable is said to be separable, if and only if it has some\ndifferences among its probability distributions in different mixture\ncomponents. We prove that mixture models are identifiable if the number of\nstrongly separable variables is greater than or equal to $2K-1$, independent\nform $M$.

We also show that mixture models are identifiable if\nthey have at least $2K$ weakly separable variables.

The typical error pattern (as found earlier for free molecules and for\nfree transition metal surfaces), in which results improve from LDA to PBE or\nPBEsol to SCAN, due to the satisfaction of more exact constraints, is not found\nhere. Instead, for CO adsorption on transition metal surfaces, we find that,\nwhile SCAN overbinds much less than LDA, it overbinds slightly more than PBE.\nMoreover, the tested functionals often predict the wrong adsorption site, as\nfirst pointed out for LDA and GGA in the ``CO/Pt (111) puzzle\". This abnormal\npattern leads us to suspect that the errors of PBE and SCAN for this problem\nare density-driven self-interaction errors associated with incorrect charge\ntransfer between molecule and metal surface.

Thus, learning\nprobabilistic representations directly from data is a deep challenge, the main\ncomputational bottleneck being inference that is intractable. Tractable\nlearning is a powerful new paradigm that attempts to learn distributions that\nsupport efficient probabilistic querying. By leveraging local structure,\nrepresentations such as sum-product networks (SPNs) can capture high tree-width\nmodels with many hidden layers, essentially a deep architecture, while still\nadmitting a range of probabilistic queries to be computable in time polynomial\nin the network size. The leaf nodes in SPNs, from which more intricate mixtures\nare formed, are tractable univariate distributions, and so the literature has\nfocused on Bernoulli and Gaussian random variables. This is clearly a\nrestriction for handling mixed discrete-continuous data, especially if the\ncontinuous features are generated from non-parametric and non-Gaussian\ndistribution families. In this work, we present a framework that systematically\nintegrates SPN structure learning with weighted model integration, a recently\nintroduced computational abstraction for performing inference in hybrid\ndomains, by means of piecewise polynomial approximations of density functions\nof arbitrary shape. Our framework is instantiated by exploiting the notion of\npropositional abstractions, thus minimally interfering with the SPN structure\nlearning module, and supports a powerful query interface for conditioning on\ninterval constraints.

This sensitive effect has not yet been\nfully explained physically and mathematically. Unlike past researches focusing\non the receptivity of the boundary layer to surface roughness, or on the local\nstability of the modified mean flow, this paper seeks possible inherent\nmechanisms by investigating the effects of distributed surface roughness on\ncrossflow instability through resonant interactions with eigenmodes. A key\nobservation is that the perturbation induced by roughness with specific\nwavenumbers can interact with two eigenmodes (travelling and stationary\nvortices) through triadic resonance, or interact with one eigenmode (stationary\nvortices) through Bragg scattering. Unlike the usual triadic resonance of\nneutral, or nearly neutral, eigenmodes, the present triadic resonance can take\nplace among modes with O(1) growth rates, provided that these are equal; unlike\nthe usual Bragg scattering involving neutral waves, crossflow stationary\nvortices can also be unstable. For these amplifying waves, the generalized\ntriadic resonance and Bragg scattering are put forward, and the resulting\ncorrections to the growth rates are derived by a multiple-scale method. The\nanalysis is extended to the case where up to four crossflow vortices interact\nwith each other in the presence of suitable roughness components. The numerical\nresults for Falkner-Skan-Cooke boundary layers show that roughness with a small\nheight (a few percent of the local boundary-layer thickness) can change growth\nrates substantially (by a more-or-less O(1) amount)....\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 00:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Consider a firm producing (or receiving) multiple\ncopies of different product types over time. The firm can offer the products to\narriving buyers, where each buyer is interested in one product type and has a\nprivate valuation drawn independently from a possibly different but known\ndistribution.\n  Our goal is to find an adaptive pricing for serving the buyers that maximizes\nthe expected social-welfare (or revenue) subject to two constraints. First, at\nany time the total number of sold items of each type is no more than the number\nof produced items. Second, the total number of sold items does not exceed the\ntotal shipping capacity. This problem is a special case of the well-known\nmatroid Bayesian online selection problem studied in [Kleinberg and Weinberg,\n2012], when the underlying matroid is laminar.\n  We give the first Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for the above\nproblem as well as its generalization to the laminar matroid Bayesian online\nselection problem when the depth of the laminar family is bounded by a\nconstant. Our approach is based on rounding the solution of a hierarchy of\nlinear programming relaxations that systematically strengthen the commonly used\nex-ante linear programming formulation of these problems and approximate the\noptimum online solution with any degree of accuracy. Our rounding algorithm\nrespects the relaxed constraints of higher-levels of the laminar tree only in\nexpectation, and exploits the negative dependency of the selection rule of\nlower-levels to achieve the required concentration that guarantees the\nfeasibility with high probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 02:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

In-situ chemistry is unlikely\nresponsible for the 15N depletion in N2; neither low-temperature gas phase\nchemistry nor isotope selective photodissociation of N2 explains the 15N\ndepletion; the former prefers transferring 15N to N2, while the latter requires\nthe penetration of interstellar FUV photons into the core center.

Results of applying extensive quasistatic shear on the prepared\nmixtures reveal that the inhomogeneous amorphous mixture containing a soft\nordered phase overall deforms more uniformly than the homogeneous one, which\nindicates that both the structure inhomogeneity and the inter-phase softness\nvariance play important roles in enhancing the uniformity of the plastic\ndeformation under shear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 05:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-01"}

Non-thermal feedback from\ngalactic cosmic rays (CRs) -high-energy charged particles accelerated in\nsupernovae and young stars - can impact the efficiency of wind driving. The\nstreaming instability limits the speed at which they can escape. However, in\nthe presence of turbulence, the streaming instability is subject to suppression\nthat depends on the magnetization of turbulence given by its Alfv\\'en Mach\nnumber. While previous simulations that relied on a simplified model of CR\ntransport have shown that super-Alfv\\'enic streaming of CRs enhances galactic\nwinds, in the present paper we take into account a realistic model of streaming\nsuppression. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a\nsection of a galactic disk and find that turbulent damping dependent on local\nmagnetization of turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) leads to more spatially\nextended gas and CR distributions compared to the earlier streaming\ncalculations, and that scale-heights of these distributions increase for\nstronger turbulence. Our results indicate that the star formation rate\nincreases with the level of turbulence in the ISM. We also find that the\ninstantaneous wind mass loading is sensitive to local streaming physics with\nthe mass loading dropping significantly as the strength of turbulence\nincreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 05:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Here we notice that the commonly\nemployed time-depend Ginzburg-Landau approach suffers with violation of the\ncharge conservation law resulting in unphysical generation of particles which\nis particularly strong for nucleating or moving electronic vortices. We present\na consistent theory which exploits the chiral transformations taking into\naccount the principle contribution of the fermionic chiral anomaly to the\neffective action. The resulting equations clarify partitions of charges,\ncurrents and rigidity among subsystems of the condensate and normal carriers.\nOn this basis we perform the numerical modeling of a spontaneously generated\ncoherent sequence of phase slips - the space-time vortices - serving for the\nconversion among the injected normal current and the collective one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 08:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

When dealing with large and sparse datasets,\ntraditional recommendation algorithms face the problem of acquiring large,\nunrestrained, fluctuating values over predictions especially for users/items\nwith very few corresponding observations. Although the problem has been\nsomewhat solved by imposing bounding constraints over its objectives, and/or\nover all entries to be within a fixed range, in terms of gaining better\nrecommendations, these approaches have two major shortcomings that we aim to\nmitigate in this work: one is they can only deal with one pair of fixed bounds\nfor all entries, and the other one is they are very time-consuming when applied\non large scale recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm\nnamed Magnitude Bounded Matrix Factorisation (MBMF), which allows different\nbounds for individual users/items and performs very fast on large scale\ndatasets. The key idea of our algorithm is to construct a model by constraining\nthe magnitudes of each individual user/item feature vector. We achieve this by\nconverting from the Cartesian to Spherical coordinate system with radii set as\nthe corresponding magnitudes, which allows the above constrained optimisation\nproblem to become an unconstrained one. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\nmethod is then applied to solve the unconstrained task efficiently.

Recently, there has been a\nsurge in interest in examining the issue of primordial magnetogenesis in the\ncontext of bouncing universes. As in the case of inflation, the conformal\ninvariance of the electromagnetic action needs to be broken in bouncing\nscenarios in order to generate primordial magnetic fields which correspond to\nobserved strengths today. The non-minimal coupling, which typically depends on\na scalar field that possibly drives the homogeneous background, leads to a\ncross-correlation at the level of the three-point function between the\nperturbation in the scalar field and the magnetic fields. This has been studied\nin some detail in the context of inflation and, specifically, it has been\nestablished that the three-point function satisfies the so-called consistency\nrelation in the squeezed limit. In this work, we study the cross-correlation\nbetween the magnetic fields and the perturbation in an auxiliary scalar field\nin a certain class of bouncing scenarios.

Among several approaches that have been\nproposed toward the resolution of Gibbs phenomenon in recent years, a Fourier\ncontinuation (FC) based approximation scheme has been suggested by Bruno and\ncollaborators in the context of certain PDE solvers where approximation grids\nused are equispaced. While the practical efficacy of FC based schemes in\nobtaining a high-order numerical solution of PDEs is well known, theoretical\nconvergence analyses largely remain unavailable. The primary objective of this\npaper is to take a step in this direction where we analyze the convergence\nrates of a Fourier continuation framework for approximations based on discrete\nfunctional data coming from equispaced grids. In this context, we explore a\ncertain two-point Hermite interpolation strategy for constructing Fourier\ncontinuations that, not only simplifies the implementation of such\napproximations but also makes possible a rigorous analysis of its numerical\nproperties.

While joint typicality decoding is\nutilized to establish the achievability of capacity region for conventional MAC\nwith fixed number of users, the technique is not directly applicable for MIMO\nmMAC. Instead, an information-theoretic approach based on Gallager's error\nexponent analysis is exploited to characterize the\n\\textcolor[rgb]{0,0,0}{finite dimension region} of MIMO mMAC. Theoretical\nresults reveal that the finite dimension region of MIMO mMAC is dominated by\nsum rate constraint only, and the individual user rate is determined by a\nspecific factor that corresponds to the allocation of sum rate. The rate in\nconventional MAC is not achievable with massive multiple access, which is due\nto the fact that successive interference cancellation cannot guarantee an\narbitrary small error decoding probability for MIMO mMAC. The results further\nimply that, asymptotically, the individual user rate is independent of the\nnumber of transmit antennas, and channel hardening makes the individual user\nrate close to that when only statistic knowledge of channel is available at\nreceiver.

For example, their\ncapability to filter out the incoming elastic waves, which include seismic\nwaves, will have a significant impact on the seismic safety of nuclear\ninfrastructure. In order to accurately design the desired frequency band gaps,\none must pay attention on how the input parameters and the interaction of the\nparameters can affect the frequency band gaps. Global sensitivity analysis can\ndecompose the dispersion relationship of the phononic crystals and screen the\nvariance attributed to each of the parameters and the interaction between them.\nPrior to the application in one-dimensional (1D) phononic crystals, this paper\nwill first review the theory of global sensitivity analysis using variance\ndecomposition (Sobol sensitivity analysis). Afterwards, the sensitivity\nanalysis is applied to study a simple mathematical model with three input\nvariables for better understanding of the concept. Then, the sensitivity\nanalysis is utilized to study the characteristic of the first frequency band\ngap in 1D phononic crystals with respect to the input parameters. This study\nreveals the quantified influence of the parameters and their correlation in\ndetermining the first frequency band gap. In addition, simple straight-forward\ndesign equations based on reduced Sobol functions are proposed to easily\nestimate the first frequency band gap. Finally, the error associated with the\nproposed design equations is also addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2018 17:01:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 18:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

In other words, for the earlier universe, the\nenergy density of whole energy-matter component behaves as matter era (baryonic\nand dark matter) and treats such as dark energy in the standard model of\ncosmology Lambda-CDM when a goes to infinity.
