In the classical setting, signals are represented as vectors and the\ndictionary learning problem is posed as a matrix factorization problem where\nthe data matrix is approximately factorized into a dictionary matrix and a\nsparse matrix of coefficients. However, in many applications in computer vision\nand medical imaging, signals are better represented as matrices or tensors\n(e.g. images or videos), where it may be beneficial to exploit the\nmulti-dimensional structure of the data to learn a more compact representation.\nOne such approach is separable dictionary learning, where one learns separate\ndictionaries for different dimensions of the data. However, typical\nformulations involve solving a non-convex optimization problem; thus\nguaranteeing global optimality remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a\nframework that builds upon recent developments in matrix factorization to\nprovide theoretical and numerical guarantees of global optimality for separable\ndictionary learning. We propose an algorithm to find such a globally optimal\nsolution, which alternates between following local descent steps and checking a\ncertificate for global optimality. We illustrate our approach on diffusion\nmagnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data, a medical imaging modality that\nmeasures water diffusion along multiple angular directions in every voxel of an\nMRI volume. State-of-the-art methods in dMRI either learn dictionaries only for\nthe angular domain of the signals or in some cases learn spatial and angular\ndictionaries independently.

However, recent high-accuracy\nforce-free electrodynamics (FFE) simulations \\cite{East2018} show that there\nare both field lines entering the horizon and field lines ending up on the\nequatorial current sheet within the ergosphere for asymptotic uniform field\nconfiguration.

In this\npaper, we revisit the uniform field solution to the Kerr BH magnetosphere\nstructure and investigate the role of the marginally force-free equatorial\nboundary condition.

For example, liquid films with surface waves are employed to\nremove heat from solid surfaces. The initial phase of the instability is\ngoverned by the Orr-Sommerfeld equation and the appropriate boundary\nconditions; therefore, the fast and accurate solution of this equation is\nuseful for industry.

However, even state-of-the-art fuzzers are not very efficient\nat finding hard-to-trigger software bugs. Most popular fuzzers use evolutionary\nguidance to generate inputs that can trigger different bugs. Such evolutionary\nalgorithms, while fast and simple to implement, often get stuck in fruitless\nsequences of random mutations. Gradient-guided optimization presents a\npromising alternative to evolutionary guidance. Gradient-guided techniques have\nbeen shown to significantly outperform evolutionary algorithms at solving\nhigh-dimensional structured optimization problems in domains like machine\nlearning by efficiently utilizing gradients or higher-order derivatives of the\nunderlying function. However, gradient-guided approaches are not directly\napplicable to fuzzing as real-world program behaviors contain many\ndiscontinuities, plateaus, and ridges where the gradient-based methods often\nget stuck. We observe that this problem can be addressed by creating a smooth\nsurrogate function approximating the discrete branching behavior of target\nprogram. In this paper, we propose a novel program smoothing technique using\nsurrogate neural network models that can incrementally learn smooth\napproximations of a complex, real-world program's branching behaviors. We\nfurther demonstrate that such neural network models can be used together with\ngradient-guided input generation schemes to significantly improve the fuzzing\nefficiency. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that NEUZZ significantly\noutperforms 10 state-of-the-art graybox fuzzers on 10 real-world programs both\nat finding new bugs and achieving higher edge coverage.

The internal architecture consists of vertical and horizontal conduits\nthat are organized to achieve gradients in porosity and pore size in the radial\ndirection to emulate cortical bone encapsulating cancellous bone. A diameter of\n30mm and height of 10mm was designed to target the repair of critically sized\nlong bone defects. The compressive properties of these graft substitutes were\ndetermined to be comparable to adult human femurs. Furthermore, dynamic fatigue\ntesting at twice the human torso weight (800N) indicated that the bone graft\nsubstitute achieved stability as quickly as 200,000 cycles, suggesting its\nability to support weight bearing loads while it gradually degrades as bone\ncells proliferate and mineralize.

Intuitively, Consensus\nshould be no harder than Broadcast, and this can be rigorously established in\nseveral models. Can Consensus be easier than Broadcast?\n  In models that allow noiseless communication, we prove a reduction of (a\nsuitable variant of) Broadcast to binary Consensus, that preserves the\ncommunication model and all complexity parameters such as randomness, number of\nrounds, communication per round, etc., while there is a loss in the success\nprobability of the protocol. Using this reduction, we get, among other\napplications, the first logarithmic lower bound on the number of rounds needed\nto achieve Consensus in the uniform GOSSIP model on the complete graph. The\nlower bound is tight and, in this model, Consensus and Broadcast are\nequivalent.\n  We then turn to distributed models with noisy communication channels that\nhave been studied in the context of some bio-inspired systems.

For the smallest insects (wing length R below 1 mm), the\nviscous effect is so large that lift-generation mechanisms used by their larger\ncounterparts become ineffective. How the weight-supporting vertical force is\ngenerated is unknown. To elucidate the aerodynamic mechanisms responsible, we\nmeasure the wing kinematics of the tiny wasp Encarsia formosa (0.6 mm R) in\nhovering or very slow ascending flight and compute and analyze the aerodynamic\nforces. We find that the insects perform two unusual wing-motions. One is\nrowing: the wings move fast downward and backward, like stroking oars; the\nother is the previously discovered Weis-Fogh fling. The rowing produces 70\npercent of the required vertical force and the Weis-Fogh fling the other 30\npercent. The oaring wing mainly produces an approximately up-pointing drag,\nresulting in the vertical force. Because each oaring produces a starting flow,\nthe drag is unsteady in nature and much greater than that in steady motion at\nthe same velocities and angles of attack. Furthermore, our computation shows\nthat if the tiny wasps employed the usual wing kinematics of the larger insects\n(flapping back and forth in a horizontal plane), vertical force produced would\nbe only one third of that by the real wing kinematics; i.e. they must use the\nspecial wing movements to overcome the problem of large viscous effects\nencountered by the commonly used flapping kinematics.

This\nproperty has motivated its recent use in multiple tests of GR. Recent work has\nsuggested that the magnification bias of galaxies due to foreground matter\nperturbations breaks the bias-independence of the $E_G$ statistic. The\nmagnitude of this effect is very sensitive to the clustering and magnification\nbiases of the galaxy sample. We show that for realistic values of the\nclustering and magnification biases, the effect for magnification bias is small\nrelative to statistical errors for most spectroscopic galaxy surveys but large\nfor photometric galaxy surveys. For the cases with significant magnification\nbias, we propose a method to calibrate magnification bias using measurements of\nthe lensing auto-power spectrum. We test this calibration method using\nsimulations, finding that our calibration method can calibrate $E_G$ from 2-4\ntimes the simulation error to well within the errors, although its accuracy is\nsensitive to the precision of the measured redshift distribution and\nmagnification bias, but not the clustering bias.

First, we show that the optimal transport is the large deviation limit\nof a particle system of Dirichlet processes transporting one probability\nmeasure on the unit simplex to another by coordinatewise multiplication and\nnormalizing. The structure of our Lagrangian and the appearance of the\nDirichlet process relate our problem closely to the entropic measure on the\nWasserstein space as defined by von-Renesse and Sturm in the context of\nWasserstein diffusion. The limiting procedure is a triangular limit where we\nallow simultaneously the number of particles to grow to infinity while the\n`noise' tends to zero. The method, which generalizes easily to many other cost\nfunctions, including the squared Euclidean distance, provides a novel\ncombination of the Schr\\\"odinger problem approach due to C.

We consider a system of equations that\ndescribes flow phenomena with multiple flow variables defined on both matrix\nand fractures. To construct our upscaled model, we will apply the nonlocal\nmulticontinua (NLMC) upscaling technique. The upscaled coefficients are\nobtained by using some multiscale basis functions, which are solutions of local\nproblems defined on oversampled regions. For each continuum within a target\ncoarse element, we will solve a local problem defined on an oversampling region\nobtained by extending the target element by few coarse grid layers, with a set\nof constraints which enforce the local solution to have mean value one on the\nchosen continuum and zero mean otherwise. The resulting multiscale basis\nfunctions have been shown to have good approximation properties. To illustrate\nthe idea of our approach, we will consider a dual continua background model\nconsisting of discrete fractures in two space dimensions, that is, we consider\na system with three continua.

Part of the problem actually consists of\ngiving a suitable definition to the notions of 'surface', 'area' and\n'boundary'. In our setting the considered objects are sets whose Hausdorff area\nis locally finite. The sliding boundary condition is given in term of a one\nparameter family of compact deformations which allows the boundary of the\nsurface to moove along a closed set. The area functional is related to\ncapillarity and free-boundary problems, and is a slight modification of the\nHausdorff area. We focused on minimal boundary cones; that is to say tangent\ncones on boundary points of sliding minimal surfaces. In particular we studied\ncones contained in an half-space and whose boundary can slide along the\nbounding hyperplane.

An instinctive approach to finding such a locally\noptimum solution is the FLIP method. Even though FLIP requires exponential time\nin worst-case instances, it tends to terminate quickly in practical instances.\nTo explain this discrepancy, the run-time of FLIP has been studied in the\nsmoothed complexity framework. Etscheid and R\\\"{o}glin showed that the smoothed\ncomplexity of FLIP for max-cut in arbitrary graphs is quasi-polynomial. Angel,\nBubeck, Peres, and Wei showed that the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max-cut\nin complete graphs is $O(\\phi^5n^{15.1})$, where $\\phi$ is an upper bound on\nthe random edge-weight density and $n$ is the number of vertices in the input\ngraph.\n  While Angel et al.'s result showed the first polynomial smoothed complexity,\nthey also conjectured that their run-time bound is far from optimal.

We illustrate this general framework by showing that the smoothed\ncomplexity of FLIP for max-$3$-cut in complete graphs is polynomial and for\nmax-$k$-cut in arbitrary graphs is quasi-polynomial.

Our analysis\ndoes not utilize knowledge of NGC 4993 as the unique host galaxy of the optical\ncounterpart to GW170817. Instead, we consider each galaxy within the GW170817\nlocalization region as a potential host; combining the redshift from each\ngalaxy with the distance estimate from GW170817 provides an estimate of the\nHubble constant, $H_0$. We then combine the $H_0$ values from all the galaxies\nto provide a final measurement of $H_0$. We explore the dependence of our\nresults on the thresholds by which galaxies are included in our sample, as well\nas the impact of weighting the galaxies by stellar mass and star-formation\nrate. Considering all galaxies brighter than $0.01 L^\\star_B$ as equally likely\nto host a BNS merger, we find $H_0= 76^{+48}_{-23}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$\n(maximum a posteriori and 68.3% highest density posterior interval; assuming a\nflat $H_0$ prior in the range $\\left[ 10, 220 \\right]$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$).\nRestricting only to galaxies brighter than $0.626 L^\\star_B$ tightens the\nmeasurement to $H_0= 77^{+37}_{-18}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

Such systems of random variables are called contextual. More\ngenerally, true contextuality is observed when different contexts force\nmeasurements of the same property (in psychology, responses to the same\nquestion) to be more dissimilar random variables than warranted by the\ndifference of their distributions. The difference in distributions is itself a\nform of context-dependence, but of another nature: it is attributable to direct\ncausal influences exerted by contexts upon the random variables. The\nContextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory allows one to separate true contextuality\nfrom direct influences in the overall context-dependence. The CbD analysis of\nnumerous previous attempts to demonstrate contextuality in human judgments\nshows that all context-dependence in them can be accounted for by direct\ninfluences, with no true contextuality present. However, contextual systems in\nhuman behavior can be found.

Online marketplaces and exchanges allow users across the world to\nconvert between dozens of different cryptocurrencies and regular currencies\nsuch as euros or dollars. Due to the novelty of this concept, the volatility of\nthese markets and the differences in maturity and usage of particular\nmarketplaces, currency pairs may appear at multiple marketplaces but at\ndifferent trading prices. This paper proposes a novel algorithmic approach to\ntake advantage of these mispricings and capitalize upon the pricing differences\nthat exist between exchanges and currency pairs. To do so, we model each\ncombination of a currency and a market as one node in a graph. A directed link\nbetween two nodes indicates that a conversion between these two currency/market\npairs is possible. The weight of the link relates to the exchange rate of\nexecuting this particular currency exchange. To leverage the mispricings, we\nseek for cycles in the graph such that upon multiplying the weights of the\nlinks in the cycle, a value greater than 1 is found and thus a profit can be\nmade. Our goal is to do this efficiently, without exhaustively enumerating all\npossible cycles in the graph. Therefore, we convert our data and address the\nproblem in terms of finding minimum weight triangles in graphs with integer\nweights, for which efficient algorithms can be utilized. We experiment with\nparameter settings (heuristics) related to the conversion of exchange rate data\ninto integer weight values. We show that our approach improves upon a\nreasonable baseline algorithm in terms of computation time. Furthermore, using\na real-world dataset, we demonstrate how the obtained minimal weight cycles\nindeed unveil a number of currency exchange cycles that result in a net profit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 08:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

Despite this, generating effective\nrecommendations with sparse user ratings remains a challenge. Side information\nassociated with items has been widely utilized to address rating sparsity.\nExisting recommendation models that use side information are linear and, hence,\nhave restricted expressiveness. Deep learning has been used to capture\nnon-linearities by learning deep item representations from side information but\nas side information is high-dimensional existing deep models tend to have large\ninput dimensionality, which dominates their overall size. This makes them\ndifficult to train, especially with small numbers of inputs.\n  Rather than learning item representations, which is problematic with\nhigh-dimensional side information, in this paper, we propose to learn feature\nrepresentation through deep learning from side information. Learning feature\nrepresentations, on the other hand, ensures a sufficient number of inputs to\ntrain a deep network. To achieve this, we propose to simultaneously recover\nuser ratings and side information, by using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).\nSpecifically, user ratings and side information are encoded and decoded\ncollectively through the same inference network and generation network. This is\npossible as both user ratings and side information are data associated with\nitems. To account for the heterogeneity of user rating and side information,\nthe final layer of the generation network follows different distributions\ndepending on the type of information. The proposed model is easy to implement\nand efficient to optimize and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art top-$N$\nrecommendation methods that use side information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 08:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

This atypical\nconverging electron flow emerges by applying uniaxial tension out of the\ndevice's symmetry axes. A part of electron flow needs to be positively\nrefracted for focusing in an asymmetric spot, whose location is tunable with\nthe strain. In AVLs, Klein tunneling is angularly shifted regards to the normal\nincidence. This perfect transmission occurs at the straight line that connects\nthe point source and focus, which is unaffected by variation of the Fermi level\nand barrier's width. Moreover, the mirror symmetry breaking by the strain also\ncauses the asymmetry in Fabry-P\\'erot interference. The novel electron optical\nlaws allow to evidence that reflected and refracted electrons in AVLs lie on\nthe same straight line with opposite group velocities and pseudo-spins. Unlike\nisotropic graphene, electrons under normal incidence present backscattering,\nangles of reflection and refraction different to zero. The average particle\ntransmission is higher (lower) than isotropic case when the tensile strain is\nincreased near (far away) the normal direction.

The received signal must not exceed a certain level of\ncomplexity, beyond which the applied signal processing solutions become\ninsufficient or slow. Moreover, the required signal-to-noise ratio of the\nreceived signal can be challenging, especially when adopting modulation formats\nwith multi-level encoding. Lately, photonic reservoir computing (RC) - a\nhardware machine learning technique with recurrent connectivity - has been\nproposed as a post-processing tool that deals with deterministic distortions\nfrom fiber transmission. Here we show that RC post-processing is remarkably\nefficient for multilevel encoding and for the use of very high launched optical\npeak power for fiber transmission up to 14dBm.

We employed the 1D non-LTE modeling of MgII\nlines assuming static isothermal-isobaric slabs. We selected a large grid of\nmodels with realistic input parameters and computed synthetic MgII lines. The\nmethod of Scargle periodograms was used to detect possible prominence\noscillations. We analyzed 2160 points of the observed prominence in five\ndifferent sections along the slit averaged over ten pixels due to low signal to\nnoise ratio in the CII and SiIV lines. We computed the integrated intensity for\nall studied lines, while the central intensity and reversal ratio was\ndetermined only for both MgII and CII 1334 lines. We plotted several\ncorrelations: time evolution of the integrated intensities and central\nintensities, scatter plots between all combinations of line integrated\nintensities, and reversal ratio as a function of integrated intensity. We also\ncompared MgII observations with the models. Results show that more than\ntwo-thirds of MgII profiles and about one-half of CII 1334 profiles are\nreversed. Profiles of SiIV are generally unreversed. The MgII and CII lines are\noptically thick, while the SiIV line is optically thin. The studied prominence\nshows no global oscillations in the MgII and CII lines. Therefore, the observed\ntime variations are caused by random motions of fine structures with velocities\nup to 10 km/s. The observed average ratio of MgII k to MgII h line intensities\ncan be used to determine the prominence's characteristic temperature. Certain\ndisagreements between observed and synthetic line intensities of MgII lines\npoint to the necessity of using more complex 2D multi-thread modeling in the\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 10:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

This\napproach, however, ignores the uncertainty in point estimates and ethical\nconcerns of assigning a lot of patients to overly toxic doses.

FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation.

This claim has been further supported by the Fermi satellite\ndiscovery of gamma-ray emission from a handful of these sources.

Our focus is on the $k$-bounded\ncase, where the algorithm has to find all pairs with min-cut value less than\n$k$, and report only those. The most basic case $k=1$ is the Transitive Closure\n(TC) problem, which can be solved in graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges in\ntime $O(mn)$ combinatorially, and in time $O(n^{\\omega})$ where $\\omega<2.38$\nis the matrix-multiplication exponent.

A short\n(1-bit), low-energy pulse is then emitted to notify neighboring nodes.\nBitSurfing adapters are shown to exhibit perpetual (and even battery-less)\noperation, ability to operate without medium access control, while being\ncompletely transparent to applications. Moreover, their operation is\nevent-driven, allowing for clock-less implementations.

Many birds are most\nreadily detected by their sounds, and thus passive acoustic monitoring is\nhighly appropriate. Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical\nlimitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example\nsound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to\ngeneralise to novel acoustic conditions. Here we report outcomes from a\ncollaborative data challenge showing that with modern machine learning\nincluding deep learning, general-purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve\nvery high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data --- with no manual\nrecalibration, and no pre-training of the detector for the target species or\nthe acoustic conditions in the target environment. Multiple methods were able\nto attain performance of around 88% AUC (area under the ROC curve), much higher\nperformance than previous general-purpose methods. We present new acoustic\nmonitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by\nchallenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such\napproaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 12:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

All the existing adversarial training\nmethods consider only how the worst perturbed examples (i.e., adversarial\nexamples) could affect the model output. Despite their success, we argue that\nsuch setting may be in lack of generalization, since the output space (or label\nspace) is apparently less informative.In this paper, we propose a novel method,\ncalled Manifold Adversarial Training (MAT). MAT manages to build an adversarial\nframework based on how the worst perturbation could affect the distributional\nmanifold rather than the output space. Particularly, a latent data space with\nthe Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) will be first derived.On one hand, MAT tries\nto perturb the input samples in the way that would rough the distributional\nmanifold the worst. On the other hand, the deep learning model is trained\ntrying to promote in the latent space the manifold smoothness, measured by the\nvariation of Gaussian mixtures (given the local perturbation around the data\npoint). Importantly, since the latent space is more informative than the output\nspace, the proposed MAT can learn better a robust and compact data\nrepresentation, leading to further performance improvement. The proposed MAT is\nimportant in that it can be considered as a superset of one recently-proposed\ndiscriminative feature learning approach called center loss. We conducted a\nseries of experiments in both supervised and semi-supervised learning on three\nbenchmark data sets, showing that the proposed MAT can achieve remarkable\nperformance, much better than those of the state-of-the-art adversarial\napproaches. We also present a series of visualization which could generate\nfurther understanding or explanation on adversarial examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 13:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

An adversary can build an algorithm to trace the individual members of\na model's training dataset. As a fundamental inference attack, he aims to\ndistinguish between data points that were part of the model's training set and\nany other data points from the same distribution. This is known as the tracing\n(and also membership inference) attack. In this paper, we focus on such attacks\nagainst black-box models, where the adversary can only observe the output of\nthe model, but not its parameters. This is the current setting of machine\nlearning as a service in the Internet.\n  We introduce a privacy mechanism to train machine learning models that\nprovably achieve membership privacy: the model's predictions on its training\ndata are indistinguishable from its predictions on other data points from the\nsame distribution. We design a strategic mechanism where the privacy mechanism\nanticipates the membership inference attacks. The objective is to train a model\nsuch that not only does it have the minimum prediction error (high utility),\nbut also it is the most robust model against its corresponding strongest\ninference attack (high privacy). We formalize this as a min-max game\noptimization problem, and design an adversarial training algorithm that\nminimizes the classification loss of the model as well as the maximum gain of\nthe membership inference attack against it. This strategy, which guarantees\nmembership privacy (as prediction indistinguishability), acts also as a strong\nregularizer and significantly generalizes the model.\n  We evaluate our privacy mechanism on deep neural networks using different\nbenchmark datasets. We show that our min-max strategy can mitigate the risk of\nmembership inference attacks (close to the random guess) with a negligible cost\nin terms of the classification error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 13:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

Such data sparsity yields two main problems for recommender\nsystems: (1) the lack of data to effectively model users' preferences, and (2)\nthe lack of data to effectively model item characteristics. However, there are\noften many other data sources that are available to a recommender system\nprovider, which can describe user interests and item characteristics (e.g.,\nusers' social network, tags associated to items, etc.).

Despite the remarkable\nprogress of deep learning in detection and recognition of individual objects,\nit is still a challenging task to localize and recognize the relations between\nobjects due to the complex combinatorial nature of various kinds of object\nrelations. Inspired by the recent advances in one-shot learning, we propose a\nsimple yet effective Semantics Induced Learner (SIL) model for solving this\nchallenging task. Learning in one-shot manner can enable a detection model to\nadapt to a huge number of object relations with diverse appearance effectively\nand robustly. In addition, the SIL combines bottom-up and top-down attention\nmech- anisms, therefore enabling attention at the level of vision and semantics\nfavorably. Within our proposed model, the bottom-up mechanism, which is based\non Faster R-CNN, proposes objects regions, and the top-down mechanism selects\nand integrates visual features according to semantic information. Experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over other state-of-the-art\nmethods on two large-scale data sets for object relation detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 13:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

A common\napproach is the deterministic queuing model, for which the structure of dynamic\nequilibria has been studied extensively in the last couple of years. The basic\nidea is to model traffic by a continuous flow that travels over time through a\nnetwork, in which the arcs are endowed with transit times and capacities.\nWhenever the flow rate exceeds the capacity the flow particles build up a\nqueue. So far it was not possible to represent spillback or kinematic waves in\nthis model. By introducing a storage capacity arcs can become full, and thus,\nmight block preceding arcs, i.e., spillback occurs. Furthermore, we model\nkinematic waves by upstream moving flows over time representing the gaps\nbetween vehicles. We carry over the main results of the original model to our\ngeneralization, i.e., we characterize Nash flows over time by sequences of\nparticular static flows, so-called spillback thin flows.

For rings, as with manifolds, it is a natural question to ask:\nto what extent do properties of the base and the fiber carry over to the\nextension? For example, if the base and fiber both satisfy a strong Lefschetz\nproperty, can we conclude the same for the extension?

This creates challenges when integrating PV systems in the\nelectricity grid and calls for accurate forecasting methods of solar\nirradiance. In this paper, we propose a triple exponential-smoothing based\nforecasting methodology for intra-hour forecasting of the solar irradiance at\nfuture lead times. We use time-series data of measured solar irradiance,\ntogether with clear-sky solar irradiance, to forecast solar irradiance up-to a\nperiod of 20 minutes.

In this work we aim at developing a more\nsophisticated model for the non-thermal emission from massive runaway star bow\nshocks. The main goal is to establish whether these systems are efficient\nnon-thermal emitters, even if they are not strong enough to be yet detected.\nFor modeling the collision between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium\nwe use 2D hydrodynamic simulations. We then adopt the flow profile of the wind\nand the ambient medium obtained with the simulation as the plasma state for\nsolving the transport of energetic particles injected in the system, and the\nnon-thermal emission they produce. For this purpose we solve a 3D (2 spatial +\nenergy) advection-diffusion equation in the test-particle approximation. We\nfind that a massive runaway star with a powerful wind converts 0.16-0.4% of the\npower injected in electrons into non-thermal emission, mostly produced by\ninverse Compton scattering of dust-emitted photons by relativistic electrons,\nand secondly by synchrotron radiation. This represents a fraction of $\\sim$\n$10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ of the wind kinetic power. Given the better sensibility of\ncurrent instruments at radio wavelengths theses systems are more prone to be\ndetected at radio through the synchrotron emission they produce rather than at\ngamma energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 14:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Possible ejection scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE)\nor dynamical ejections from star clusters (DE). Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are\nextreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound from the Galaxy. Powerful\nacceleration mechanisms such as the tidal disruption of a binary system by a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) are required to produce them. Therefore, HVSs\nare believed to originate in the Galactic center (GC), the only place known to\nhost an SMBH. The second Gaia data release (DR2) offers the opportunity of\nstudying HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit some of the most\ninteresting high-velocity stars, that is, 15 stars for which proper motions\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope were obtained in the pre-Gaia era, to unravel\ntheir origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses based on revised\nspectrophotometric distances and proper motions from Gaia DR2, kinematic\nproperties were obtained that help constrain the spatial origins of these\nstars. Stars that were previously considered (un)bound remain (un)bound in\nGalactic potentials favored by Gaia DR2 astrometry. For nine stars (five\ncandidate HVSs plus all four radial velocity outliers), the GC can be ruled out\nas spatial origin at least at $2\\sigma$ confidence level, suggesting that a\nlarge portion of the known HVSs are disk runaway stars launched close to or\nbeyond Galactic escape velocities. The fastest star in the sample, HVS3, is\nconfirmed to originate in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Because the ejection\nvelocities of five of our non-GC stars are close to or above the upper limits\npredicted for BSE and DE, another powerful dynamical ejection mechanism (e.g.,\ninvolving massive perturbers such as intermediate-mass black holes) is likely\nto operate in addition to the three classical scenarios mentioned above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 15:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 11:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

In this work, we\npropose an original and versatile particle Monte Carlo approach parametrized by\nusing ab-initio data. Both the phonon dispersion and the phonon-phonon\nscattering rates have been computed by DFT calculation in the entire 3D\nBrillouin zone.

It\nis shown that the effective thermal conductivity in quasi-ballistic regime\nobtained from our Monte Carlo simulation cannot be accurately fitted by simple\nsemi-analytical Matthiessen-like models and that spectral approaches are\nmandatory to get good results. Our Full Band approach shows that some phonon\nbranches exhibiting a negative group velocity in some parts of the Brillouin\nzone may contribute negatively to the total thermal flux. Besides, the thermal\nflux clearly appears to be oriented along directions of high density of states.\nThe resulting anisotropy of the heat flux is discussed together with the\ninfluence of rough interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 15:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The control systems community has started to show\ninterest towards several machine learning algorithms from the sub-domains such\nas supervised learning, imitation learning and reinforcement learning to\nachieve autonomous control and intelligent decision making. Amongst many\ncomplex control problems, stable bipedal walking has been the most challenging\nproblem. In this paper, we present an architecture to design and simulate a\nplanar bipedal walking robot(BWR) using a realistic robotics simulator, Gazebo.\nThe robot demonstrates successful walking behaviour by learning through several\nof its trial and errors, without any prior knowledge of itself or the world\ndynamics. The autonomous walking of the BWR is achieved using reinforcement\nlearning algorithm called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG). DDPG is one\nof the algorithms for learning controls in continuous action spaces. After\ntraining the model in simulation, it was observed that, with a proper shaped\nreward function, the robot achieved faster walking or even rendered a running\ngait with an average speed of 0.83 m/s. The gait pattern of the bipedal walker\nwas compared with the actual human walking pattern. The results show that the\nbipedal walking pattern had similar characteristics to that of a human walking\npattern.

Asymmetries assumed to exist in the slow wind\nenvelope lead to inertial confinement shaping the resulting interacting winds\nflow. We present new results demonstrating the effectiveness of Common Envelope\nEvolution (CEE) at producing aspherical envelopes which, when impinged upon by\na spherical fast stellar wind, produce highly bipolar, jet-like outflows. We\nhave run two simple cases using the output of a single PHANTOM SPH CEE\nsimulation. Our work uses the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code AstroBEAR to track\nthe interaction of the fast wind and CEE ejecta allowing us to follow the\nmorphological evolution of the outflow lobes at high resolution in 3-D. Our two\nmodels bracket low and high momentum output fast winds. We find the interaction\nleads to highly collimated bipolar outflows. In addition, the bipolar\nmorphology depends on the fast wind momentum injection rate. With this\ndependence comes the initiation of significant symmetry breaking between the\ntop and bottom bipolar lobes. Our simulations, though simplified, confirm the\nlong-standing belief that CEE can plan a major role in PPN and PN shaping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 15:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

We introduce Siamese Survival Prognosis Network (SSPN), a novel deep\nlearning architecture for estimating personalized risk scores in the presence\nof competing risks. SSPN circumvents the nonidentifiability problem by avoiding\nthe estimation of cause-specific survival curves and instead determines\npairwise concordant time-dependent risks, where longer event times are assigned\nlower risks. Furthermore, SSPN is able to directly optimize an approximation to\nthe C-discrimination index, rather than relying on well-known metrics which are\nunable to capture the unique requirements of survival analysis with competing\nrisks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 15:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 22:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-20"}

The first two steps are usually\nrelated to denoising and demosaicking where the former aims to reduce noise\nfrom the sensor and the latter converts a series of light intensity readings to\ncolor images. Modern approaches try to jointly solve these problems, i.e. joint\ndenoising-demosaicking which is an inherently ill-posed problem given that\ntwo-thirds of the intensity information is missing and the rest are perturbed\nby noise. While there are several machine learning systems that have been\nrecently introduced to solve this problem, the majority of them relies on\ngeneric network architectures which do not explicitly take into account the\nphysical image model.
