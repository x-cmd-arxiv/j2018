First, in\ncontrast to the linear costs, dynamics, and constraints of standard DDP, we\nconsider problems in which all of these can be polynomial functions. Second, we\nallow the state trajectory to be described by probability distributions rather\nthan point values, and return approximate value functions fitted to these. The\nalgorithm is in part an adaptation of sum-of-squares techniques used in the\napproximate dynamic programming literature. It alternates between a forward\nsimulation through the horizon, in which the moments of the state distribution\nare propagated through a succession of single-stage problems, and a backward\nrecursion, in which a new polynomial function is derived for each stage using\nthe moments of the state as fixed data. The value function approximation\nreturned for a given stage is the point-wise maximum of all polynomials derived\nfor that stage. This contrasts with the piecewise affine functions derived in\nconventional DDP. We prove key convergence properties of the new algorithm, and\nvalidate it in simulation on two case studies related to the optimal operation\nof energy storage devices with nonlinear characteristics.

This work constructs a minimal Hilbert space version of the\nOrnstein-Zernike theory over the complete spatial, rotational, and internal\nconformational space that leaves the choice of basis open. The basis is minimal\nin the sense that it is isomorphic to a choice of molecular property space\n(i.e. moments of the distribution), and does not require auxiliary grids. This\ncan be exploited, since there are usually only a few `important' properties for\ndetermining the structure and energetics of a molecular fluid.

Manual examination is highly time-consuming and\nerror prone, calling for computer-aided detection, both to improve efficiency\nand reduce misdiagnosis. Over the years, a range of systems have been proposed,\nmostly following a two-phase paradigm with: 1) candidate detection, 2) false\npositive reduction. Recently, deep learning has become a dominant force in\nalgorithm development. As for candidate detection, prior art was mainly based\non the two-stage Faster R-CNN framework, which starts with an initial sub-net\nto generate a set of class-agnostic region proposals, followed by a second\nsub-net to perform classification and bounding-box regression. In contrast, we\nabandon the conventional two-phase paradigm and two-stage framework altogether\nand propose to train a single network for end-to-end nodule detection instead,\nwithout transfer learning or further post-processing. Our feature learning\nmodel is a modification of the ResNet and feature pyramid network combined,\npowered by RReLU activation. The major challenge is the condition of extreme\ninter-class and intra-class sample imbalance, where the positives are\noverwhelmed by a large negative pool, which is mostly composed of easy and a\nhandful of hard negatives. Direct training on all samples can seriously\nundermine training efficacy. We propose a patch-based sampling strategy over a\nset of regularly updating anchors, which narrows sampling scope to all\npositives and only hard negatives, effectively addressing this issue. As a\nresult, our approach substantially outperforms prior art in terms of both\naccuracy and speed.

Motivated by the anomalously slow snap-through\nshown by spherical elastic caps, we consider a thought experiment in which the\ntruss is first indented to an inverted state and allowed to relax while a\nspecified displacement is maintained; the constraint of an imposed displacement\nis then removed. Focussing on the dynamics for the limit in which the timescale\nof viscous relaxation is much larger than the characteristic elastic timescale,\nwe show that two types of snap-through are possible: the truss either\nimmediately snaps back over the elastic timescale or it displays\n`pseudo-bistability', in which it undergoes a slow creeping motion before\nrapidly accelerating. In particular, we demonstrate that accurately determining\nwhen pseudo-bistability occurs requires the consideration of inertial effects\nimmediately after the indentation force is removed. Our analysis also explains\nmany basic features of pseudo-bistability that have been observed previously in\nexperiments and numerical simulations; for example, we show that\npseudo-bistability occurs in a narrow parameter range at the bifurcation\nbetween bistability and monostability, so that the dynamics is naturally\nsusceptible to critical slowing down. We then study an analogous thought\nexperiment performed on a continuous arch, showing that the qualitative\nfeatures of the snap-through dynamics are well captured by the truss model.

Stellar orbits can be quantified by three dynamical\nactions, J_r, L_z, and J_z, which provide measures of the orbital eccentricity,\nguiding radius, and non-planarity, respectively. Changes in these dynamical\nactions over time reflect the strength and efficiency of the evolutionary\nprocesses that drive stellar redistributions. We examine how dynamical actions\nof stars are correlated with their age using two samples of stars with\nwell-determined ages: 78 solar twin stars (with ages to ~5%) and 4376 stars\nfrom the APOKASC2 sample (~20%). We compute actions using spectroscopic radial\nvelocities from previous surveys and parallax and proper motion measurements\nfrom Gaia DR2. We find weak gradients in all actions with stellar age, of (7.51\n+/- 0.52, -29.0 +/- 1.83, 1.54 +/- 0.18) kpc km/s/Gyr for J_r, L_z, and J_z,\nrespectively. There is, however, significant scatter in the action-age\nrelation. We caution that our results will be affected by the restricted\nspatial extent of our sample, particularly in the case of J_z. Nevertheless,\nthese action-age gradients and their associated variances provide strong\nconstraints on the efficiency of the mechanisms that drive the redistribution\nof stellar orbits over time and demonstrate that actions are informative as to\nstellar age. The shallow action-age gradients combined with the large\ndispersion in each action at a given age, however, renders the prospect of age\ninference from orbits of individual stars bleak. Using the precision\nmeasurements of [Fe/H] and [$\\alpha$/Fe] for our stars we investigate the\nabundance-action relationship and find weak correlations. Similar to our\nstellar age results, dynamical actions afford little discriminating power\nbetween low- and high-$\\alpha$ stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 17:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 16:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 18:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

In\nthis model, the answer strings are not returned through noiseless bit pipes,\nbut rather through \\emph{noisy} memoryless channels. We aim at characterizing\nthe PIR capacity for this model as a function of the statistical information\nmeasures of the noisy channels such as entropy and mutual information. We\nderive a general upper bound for the retrieval rate in the form of a max-min\noptimization. We use the achievable schemes for the PIR problem under\nasymmetric traffic constraints and random coding arguments to derive a general\nlower bound for the retrieval rate. The upper and lower bounds match for $M=2$\nand $M=3$, for any $N$, and any noisy channel. The results imply that\nseparation between channel coding and retrieval is optimal except for adapting\nthe traffic ratio from the databases. We refer to this as \\emph{almost\nseparation}. Next, we consider the private information retrieval problem from\nmultiple access channels (MAC-PIR). In MAC-PIR, the database responses reach\nthe user through a multiple access channel (MAC) that mixes the responses\ntogether in a stochastic way. We show that for the additive MAC and the\nconjunction/disjunction MAC, channel coding and retrieval scheme are\n\\emph{inseparable} unlike in NPIR. We show that the retrieval scheme depends on\nthe properties of the MAC, in particular on the linearity aspect. For both\ncases, we provide schemes that achieve the full capacity without any loss due\nto the privacy constraint, which implies that the user can exploit the nature\nof the channel to improve privacy. Finally, we show that the full unconstrained\ncapacity is not always attainable by determining the capacity of the selection\nchannel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 17:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}

Furthermore, investigating the recently reported result that planets\nwith radii in the range (2-6Rearth) are more common at short periods around\nhigher metallicity stars in detail, we find that the average host star\nmetallicity of H/He atmosphere-hosting planets increases smoothly inside an\norbital period of ~20 days.

Therefore, planets with higher metallicity atmospheres are able to\nresist photoevaporation at shorter orbital periods. Finally, we find evidence\nat 2.8 sigma that planets that do not host H/He atmospheres at long periods are\nmore commonly found around lower metallicity stars.

As a result,\nwhether a given bulk operator can be reconstructed on the boundary at all can\ndepend on whether the black hole is described by a pure state or thermal\nensemble. We refine this dichotomy, demonstrating that the same boundary\noperator can often be used for large subspaces of black hole microstates,\ncorresponding to a constant fraction $\\alpha$ of the black hole entropy. In the\nSchrodinger picture, the boundary subregion encodes the $\\alpha$-bits (a\nconcept from quantum information) of a bulk region containing the black hole\nand bounded by extremal surfaces. These results have important consequences for\nthe structure of AdS/CFT and for quantum information. Firstly, they imply that\nthe bulk reconstruction is necessarily only approximate and allow us to place\nnon-perturbative lower bounds on the error when doing so. Second, they provide\na simple and tractable limit in which the entanglement wedge is\nstate-dependent, but in a highly controlled way. Although the state dependence\nof operators comes from ordinary quantum error correction, there are clear\nconnections to the Papadodimas-Raju proposal for understanding operators behind\nblack hole horizons. In tensor network toy models of AdS/CFT, we see how state\ndependence arises from the bulk operator being `pushed' through the black hole\nitself. Finally, we show that black holes provide the first `explicit' examples\nof capacity-achieving $\\alpha$-bit codes.

Recent methods based on deep convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) have outperformed former heuristic methods. However,\nthose methods were primarily evaluated on rigid, real-world environments. In\nthis study, existing segmentation methods were evaluated for their use on a new\ndataset of transoral endoscopic exploration. Methods Four machine learning\nbased methods SegNet, UNet, ENet and ErfNet were trained with supervision on a\nnovel 7-class dataset of the human larynx. The dataset contains 536 manually\nsegmented images from two patients during laser incisions. The\nIntersection-over-Union (IoU) evaluation metric was used to measure the\naccuracy of each method. Data augmentation and network ensembling were employed\nto increase segmentation accuracy. Stochastic inference was used to show\nuncertainties of the individual models. Patient-to-patient transfer was\ninvestigated using patient-specific fine-tuning. Results In this study, a\nweighted average ensemble network of UNet and ErfNet was best suited for the\nsegmentation of laryngeal soft tissue with a mean IoU of 84.7 %.

Conclusion CNN-based methods for semantic\nsegmentation are applicable to endoscopic images of laryngeal soft tissue.

The premise of radiomics is that quantitative\nimage features can serve as biomarkers characterizing disease. For such\nbiomarkers to be useful, repeatability is a basic requirement, meaning its\nvalue must remain stable between two scans, if the conditions remain stable. We\ninvestigated repeatability of radiomics features under various preprocessing\nand extraction configurations including various image normalization schemes,\ndifferent image pre-filtering, 2D vs 3D texture computation, and different bin\nwidths for image discretization. Image registration as means to re-identify\nregions of interest across time points was evaluated against human-expert\nsegmented regions in both time points. Even though we found many radiomics\nfeatures and preprocessing combinations with a high repeatability (Intraclass\nCorrelation Coefficient (ICC) > 0.85), our results indicate that overall the\nrepeatability is highly sensitive to the processing parameters (under certain\nconfigurations, it can be below 0.0). Image normalization, using a variety of\napproaches considered, did not result in consistent improvements in\nrepeatability. There was also no consistent improvement of repeatability\nthrough the use of pre-filtering options, or by using image registration\nbetween timepoints to improve consistency of the region of interest\nlocalization.

Pleasingly, our\nprogram logics retain the comfortable reasoning style of informal proofs thanks\nto carefully selected axiomatizations of key results from probability theory.\nThe versatility of our logics is illustrated through the formal verification of\nseveral intricate examples from statistics, probabilistic inference, and\nmachine learning. We further show the expressiveness of our logics by giving\nsound embeddings of existing logics. In particular, we do this in a parametric\nway by showing how the semantics idea of (unary and relational) TT-lifting can\nbe internalized in our logics.

Over a field of view of 5'\nequivalent diameter, it will deliver X-ray spectra from 0.2 to 12 keV with a\nspectral resolution of 2.5 eV up to 7 keV on ~5 arcsecond pixels. The X-IFU is\nbased on a large format array of super-conducting molybdenum-gold Transition\nEdge Sensors cooled at about 90 mK, each coupled with an absorber made of gold\nand bismuth with a pitch of 249 microns. A cryogenic anti-coincidence detector\nlocated underneath the prime TES array enables the non X-ray background to be\nreduced. A bath temperature of about 50 mK is obtained by a series of\nmechanical coolers combining 15K Pulse Tubes, 4K and 2K Joule-Thomson coolers\nwhich pre-cool a sub Kelvin cooler made of a 3He sorption cooler coupled with\nan Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator. Frequency domain multiplexing\nenables to read out 40 pixels in one single channel. A photon interacting with\nan absorber leads to a current pulse, amplified by the readout electronics and\nwhose shape is reconstructed on board to recover its energy with high accuracy.\nThe defocusing capability offered by the Athena movable mirror assembly enables\nthe X-IFU to observe the brightest X-ray sources of the sky (up to Crab-like\nintensities) by spreading the telescope point spread function over hundreds of\npixels. Thus the X-IFU delivers low pile-up, high throughput (>50%), and\ntypically 10 eV spectral resolution at 1 Crab intensities, i.e. a factor of 10\nor more better than Silicon based X-ray detectors. In this paper, the current\nX-IFU baseline is presented, together with an assessment of its anticipated\nperformance in terms of spectral resolution, background, and count rate\ncapability. The X-IFU baseline configuration will be subject to a preliminary\nrequirement review that is scheduled at the end of 2018.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 20:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Astronomers often speak\nof the \"metallicity\" in broad terms. When modeling the bulk metallicity,\nworkers refer to the elemental iron abundance (Fe/H). By contrast, when\nexo-atmospheric astronomers speak of the \"metallicity\" derived from analysing\nlow-resolution Hubble and Spitzer spectrophotometry, they are referring to the\nelemental abundances of oxygen (O/H), carbon (C/H) and nitrogen (N/H): in\ndecreasing order of importance, since spectra from the Hubble Wide Field Camera\n3 are primarily sensitive to water with secondary contributions from hydrogen\ncyanide and ammonia, while Spitzer photometry is sensitive to methane and\ncarbon monoxide. From retrieving for the water abundances, workers such as\nKreidberg et al. (2014), Wakeford et al. (2017, 2018), Arcangeli et al. (2018)\nand Mansfield et al. (2018) have published figures that show the \"metallicity\"\nversus the masses of the exoplanets. Even if we assume that bulk and\natmospheric elemental abundances are equal, the motivation behind this research\nnote is to demonstrate that the conversion between the water abundance and O/H\nis not straightforward. \"Water at solar metallicity\" is a temperature- and\npressure-dependent statement, because there is no single value of the water\nvolume mixing ratio corresponding to solar values of O/H and C/H. Overall, the\nconversion factor between the water volume mixing ratio and O/H is not unity\nand depends on temperature, pressure, O/H, C/H and C/O, even without invoking\ndisequilibrium chemistry (photochemistry and/or atmospheric mixing). It remains\nunproven that disequilibrium chemistry or condensation will always return a\nconversion factor of unity. It is thus a fair statement to say that the\n\"metallicity\" estimates inferred from atmospheric retrievals are\nmodel-dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 20:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

In\nslowly rotating planets, a moving forcing can induce strong jets in the upper\ntroposphere, both prograde and retrograde, sensitive to the speed and direction\nof the diurnal forcing. We find that, consistent with previous shallow water\nmodel experiments, the thermal phase curve offset is sensitive to the velocity\nof the substellar point moving across the surface of the planet. For a planet\nwith a known orbital period, the results show that the observed hotspot on the\nplanet could be either east or west of the substellar point, depending on\nwhether the planet is tidally-locked or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 21:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

In thin films, the characteristic length of polygonal\ncracks is known to monotonically increase with the film thickness, however,\nexisting theories that consider the mechanical, thermodynamic, hydrodynamic,\nand statistical properties of cracking often lead to contradictory predictions.\nHere we experimentally investigate polygonal cracks in drying suspensions of\nmicron-sized particles by varying film thickness, boundary adhesion, packing\nfraction, and solvent. Although polygonal cracks were observed in most systems\nabove a critical film thickness, in cornstarch-water mixtures, multi-scale\ncrack patterns were observed due to two distinct desiccation mechanisms.\nLarge-scale, primary polygons initially form due to capillary-induced film\nshrinkage, whereas small-scale, secondary polygons appear later due to the\ndeswelling of the hygroscopic particles. In addition, we find that the\ncharacteristic area of the polygonal cracks, $A_p$, obeys a universal power\nlaw, $A_p=\\alpha h^{4/3}$, where $h$ is the film thickness.

To reach the target an extended\nfunctional setting is introduced, permitting the treatment of a non-stationary\nbackground metric tensor allowed to depend on both space-time coordinates and a\nsuitably-defined invariant proper-time parameter. Based on the Hamiltonian\nrepresentation of the corresponding quantum hydrodynamic equations occurring in\nsuch a context, the quantum-modified Einstein field equations are obtained. As\nan application, the quantum origin of the cosmological constant is\ninvestigated. This is shown to be ascribed to the non-linear Bohm quantum\ninteraction of the gravitational field with itself in vacuum and to depend\ngenerally also on the realization of the quantum probability density for the\nquantum gravitational field tensor. The emerging physical picture predicts a\ngenerally non-stationary quantum cosmological constant which originates from\nfluctuations (i.e., gradients) of vacuum quantum gravitational energy density\nand is consistent with the existence of quantum massive gravitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 22:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

The goal is to design a\nsequential algorithm that can detect a \"significant\" event, i.e., when the\nevent has affected no fewer than $\\eta$ nodes, as quickly as possible, while\ncontrolling the false alarm rate. Fully connected networks are studied first,\nand the results are then extended to arbitrarily connected networks.

In fact, the past\nPresidential elections in the United States as well as those in Great Britain\n(Brexit) and in Colombia (peace agreement referendum) are proof that social\nmedia play an important part in modern politics. In fact, this digital\npolitical field is filled by political movements and political candidates\nlooking for popular support (number of followers), regular citizens' messages\ndiscussing social issues (trending topics flooding social media), or even\npolitical propaganda in favor or against politicians or political movements\n(advertisement). One of the issues with social media in this era is the\npresence of automatic accounts (bots) that artificially fill accounts with fake\nfollowers, create false trending topics, and share fake news or simply flood\nthe net with propaganda. All this artificial information may influence people\nand sometimes may even censor people's real opinions undermining their freedom\nof speech. In this paper, we propose a methodology to track elections and a set\nof tools used to collect and analyze election data.

In fact, we show how all candidates prepared an online campaign in social\nmedia (Twitter) and how the political campaign altered a common follower rate\nsubscription.

Experiments are conducted to evaluate BARS\nin terms of security and performance and the results show that BARS is able to\nestablish distributed trust management, while protecting the privacy of\nvehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 00:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

In order to develop an approach that is able to successfully\nfulfill this objective, there are two main challenges that ought to be\naddressed. The first challenge is to define the extent of the target area. An\nunsupervised machine learning approach is proposed to overcome this difficulty.\nThe second challenge is to correctly identify the main causes of\nvegetation-related outages and to thoroughly investigate their nature. In this\npaper, these outages are categorized into two main groups: growth-related and\nweather-related outages, and two types of models, namely time series and\nnon-linear machine learning regression models are proposed to conduct the\nprediction tasks, respectively. Moreover, various features that can explain the\nvariability in vegetation-related outages are engineered and employed. Actual\noutage data, obtained from a major utility in the U.S., in addition to\ndifferent types of weather and geographical data are utilized to build the\nproposed approach. Finally, by utilizing various time series models and machine\nlearning methods, a comprehensive case study is carried out to demonstrate how\nthe proposed approach can be used to successfully predict the number of\nvegetation-related outages and to help decision-makers to detect vulnerable\nzones in their systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 02:09:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 20:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

The\nresulting datasets are quite large, which has presented a barrier to routine\nopen sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of\nthe art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix\nfactorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem,\nand are effective when good initializations are available, but can break down\nin low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail. Here we\nintroduce an approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The\nmethod is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD)\nof the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated)\nnoise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is\ntherefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or\nrequire stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more\nrobust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the\ndata, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range\nof functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon,\nwidefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets):\nin all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of\n20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of\nhyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed\nactivity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two\nchallenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging\ndata in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our\nnew approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from\nthe data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 04:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Major improvements in mapmaking have\nbeen achieved since the previous 2015 release. They enabled the first\nsignificant measurement of the reionization optical depth parameter using HFI\ndata. This paper presents an extensive analysis of systematic effects,\nincluding the use of simulations to facilitate their removal and characterize\nthe residuals. The polarized data, which presented a number of known problems\nin the 2015 Planck release, are very significantly improved. Calibration, based\non the CMB dipole, is now extremely accurate and in the frequency range 100 to\n353 GHz reduces intensity-to-polarization leakage caused by calibration\nmismatch. The Solar dipole direction has been determined in the three lowest\nHFI frequency channels to within one arc minute, and its amplitude has an\nabsolute uncertainty smaller than $0.35\\mu$K, an accuracy of order $10^{-4}$.\nThis is a major legacy from the HFI for future CMB experiments. The removal of\nbandpass leakage has been improved by extracting the bandpass-mismatch\ncoefficients for each detector as part of the mapmaking process; these values\nin turn improve the intensity maps. This is a major change in the philosophy of\n\"frequency maps\", which are now computed from single detector data, all\nadjusted to the same average bandpass response for the main foregrounds.\nSimulations reproduce very well the relative gain calibration of detectors, as\nwell as drifts within a frequency induced by the residuals of the main\nsystematic effect. Using these simulations, we measure and correct the small\nfrequency calibration bias induced by this systematic effect at the $10^{-4}$\nlevel. There is no detectable sign of a residual calibration bias between the\nfirst and second acoustic peaks in the CMB channels, at the $10^{-3}$ level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 04:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Our revised CMB temperature maps agree with corresponding products\nin the Planck 2015 delivery, whereas the polarization maps exhibit\nsignificantly lower large-scale power, reflecting the improved data processing\ndescribed in companion papers; however, the noise properties of the resulting\ndata products are complicated, and the best available end-to-end simulations\nexhibit relative biases with respect to the data at the few percent level.\nUsing these maps, we are for the first time able to fit the spectral index of\nthermal dust independently over 3 degree regions. We derive a conservative\nestimate of the mean spectral index of polarized thermal dust emission of\nbeta_d = 1.55 +/- 0.05, where the uncertainty marginalizes both over all known\nsystematic uncertainties and different estimation techniques.

The results are fully consistent with the\ntwo previous Planck cosmological releases, but have smaller uncertainties\nthanks to improvements in the characterization of polarization at low and high\nmultipoles. Planck temperature, polarization, and lensing data determine the\nspectral index of scalar perturbations to be $n_\\mathrm{s}=0.9649\\pm 0.0042$ at\n68% CL and show no evidence for a scale dependence of $n_\\mathrm{s}.$ Spatial\nflatness is confirmed at a precision of 0.4% at 95% CL with the combination\nwith BAO data. The Planck 95% CL upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\n$r_{0.002}<0.10$, is further tightened by combining with the BICEP2/Keck Array\nBK15 data to obtain $r_{0.002}<0.056$. In the framework of single-field\ninflationary models with Einstein gravity, these results imply that: (a)\nslow-roll models with a concave potential, $V\" (\\phi) < 0,$ are increasingly\nfavoured by the data; and (b) two different methods for reconstructing the\ninflaton potential find no evidence for dynamics beyond slow roll.\nNon-parametric reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum consistently\nconfirm a pure power law. A complementary analysis also finds no evidence for\ntheoretically motivated parameterized features in the Planck power spectrum, a\nresult further strengthened for certain oscillatory models by a new combined\nanalysis that includes Planck bispectrum data. The new Planck polarization data\nprovide a stringent test of the adiabaticity of the initial conditions. The\npolarization data also provide improved constraints on inflationary models that\npredict a small statistically anisotropic quadrupolar modulation of the\nprimordial fluctuations. However, the polarization data do not confirm physical\nmodels for a scale-dependent dipolar modulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 04:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 11:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

We confirm that the mean and maximum of\n$p$ decrease with increasing $N_H$. The uncertainty on the maximum polarization\nfraction, $p_\\mathrm{max}=22.0$% at 80 arcmin resolution, is dominated by the\nuncertainty on the zero level in total intensity. The observed inverse\nbehaviour between $p$ and $S$ is interpreted with models of the polarized sky\nthat include effects from only the topology of the turbulent Galactic magnetic\nfield. Thus, the statistical properties of $p$, $\\psi$, and $S$ mostly reflect\nthe structure of the magnetic field. Nevertheless, we search for potential\nsignatures of varying grain alignment and dust properties. First, we analyse\nthe product map $S \\times p$, looking for residual trends. While $p$ decreases\nby a factor of 3--4 between $N_H=10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $N_H=2\\times 10^{22}$\ncm$^{-2}$, $S \\times p$ decreases by only about 25%, a systematic trend\nobserved in both the diffuse ISM and molecular clouds. Second, we find no\nsystematic trend of $S \\times p$ with the dust temperature, even though in the\ndiffuse ISM lines of sight with high $p$ and low $S$ tend to have colder dust.\nWe also compare Planck data with starlight polarization in the visible at high\nlatitudes. The agreement in polarization angles is remarkable. Two polarization\nemission-to-extinction ratios that characterize dust optical properties depend\nonly weakly on $N_H$ and converge towards the values previously determined for\ntranslucent lines of sight. We determine an upper limit for the polarization\nfraction in extinction of 13%, compatible with the $p_\\mathrm{max}$ observed in\nemission.

On the contrary, the regularization term learned via\ndiscriminative approaches are usually trained for a specific image restoration\nproblem, and fail in the problem for which it is not trained. To address this\nissue, we propose a generic diffusion process (genericDP) to handle multiple\nGaussian denoising problems based on the Trainable Non-linear Reaction\nDiffusion (TNRD) models. Instead of one model, which consists of a diffusion\nand a reaction term, for one Gaussian denoising problem in TNRD, we enforce\nmultiple TNRD models to share one diffusion term. The trained genericDP model\ncan provide both promising denoising performance and high training efficiency\ncompared with the original TNRD models.

The upper region of its valence band is found to solely consist\nof lone pair p-orbital states, which are by nature more delocalized than the\nd-orbital states in transition metal dichalcogenides, implying superior\ntransport performance of antimonene. The Young's and shear moduli of\nbeta-antimonene are observed to be ~25% higher than those of bulk antimony,\nwhile the hexagonal lattice constant of the monolayer reduces significantly\n(~5%) from that in bulk, indicative of strong inter-layer coupling. The ideal\ntensile test of beta-antimonene under applied uniaxial strain highlights ideal\nstrengths of 6 GPa and 8 GPa, corresponding to critical strains of 15% and 17%\nin the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. During the deformation\nprocess, the structural integrity of the material is shown to be better\npreserved, albeit moderately, in the armchair direction. Interestingly, the\napplication of uniaxial strain in the zigzag and armchair directions unveil\ndirection-dependent trends in the electronic band structure.

Currently, all such MPC algorithms require\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ memory per machine. Czumaj et al.

Since a\nlarge number of consumer UAVs suffer from tight weight and power constraints,\nour work focuses on obstacle avoidance based on a lightweight stereo camera\nsetup. We use disparity maps, which are computed from the camera images, to\nlocate obstacles and to automatically steer the UAV around them.

The disparity maps are then converted\ninto simpler representations, the so called U-/V-Maps, which are used for\nobstacle detection. Obstacle avoidance is based on a reactive approach which\nfinds the shortest path around the obstacles as soon as they have a critical\ndistance to the UAV. One of the fundamental goals of our work was the reduction\nof development costs by closing the gap between application development and\nhardware optimization. Hence, we aimed at using high-level synthesis (HLS) for\nporting our algorithms, which are written in C/C++, to the embedded FPGA.

In parameterized query complexity, we estimate\nthe number of queries to the oracle based on the parameter $k$, the size of the\nHitting-Set. The subset query oracle we use in this paper is called Generalized\n$d$-partite Independent Set query oracle (GPIS) and it was introduced by Bishnu\net al. (ISAAC'18). GPIS is a generalization to hypergraphs of the Bipartite\nIndependent Set query oracle (BIS) introduced by Beame et al. (ITCS'18 and\nTALG'20) for estimating the number of edges in graphs.

Comparing the data with our models, we can\ncharacterise the radial regions of our Galaxy. A shorter infall time-scale is\nneeded in the inner regions, while the outer regions need a longer infall\ntime-scale, coupled with a higher star formation efficiency. We compare our\nresults with nebular abundances obtained in MaNGA galaxies, finding in our\nGalaxy a much wider range of log(N/O) than in integrated observations of\nexternal galaxies of similar stellar mass, but similar to the ranges found in\nstudies of individual H ii regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 09:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

They owe their chemical\npeculiarities to a past mass transfer phase. During which they were polluted by\ntheir binary companion, which at the time was an AGB star, but is now an\nextinct white dwarf. Barium stars are thus ideal targets for understanding and\nconstraining the s-process in low and intermediate-mass AGB stars. We derive\nthe abundances of a large number of heavy elements in order to shed light on\nthe conditions of operation of the neutron source responsible for the\nproduction of s-elements in the former companions of the barium stars. Adopting\na recently used methodology(Neyskens et al. 2015), we analyse a sample of 18\nhighly enriched barium stars observed with the high-resolution HERMES\nspectrograph mounted on the MERCATOR telescope (La Palma). We determine the\nstellar parameters and abundances using MARCS model atmospheres. In particular,\nwe derive the Nb/Zr ratio which was previously shown to be a sensitive\nthermometer for the s-process nucleosynthesis. Indeed, in barium stars,\n$^{93}Zr$ has fully decayed into mono-isotopic $^{93}Nb$ , so Nb/Zr is a\nmeasure of the temperature-sensitive $^{93}Zr/Zr$ isotopic ratio. HD 28159,\npreviously classified as K5III and initially selected to serve as a reference\ncool K star for our abundance analysis, turns out to be enriched in s-process\nelements, and as such is a new barium star. Four stars, characterised by high\nnitrogen abundances, also tend to have high [Nb/Zr] and [hs/ls] ratios. The\nderived Zr and Nb abundances provide more accurate constraints on the s-process\nneutron source, identified to be $^{13}C(alpha,n)^{16}O$ for barium stars. The\ncomparison with stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis models shows that the\ninvestigated barium stars were polluted by a low-mass (2-3 Solar mass) AGB\nstar. HD 100503 is potentially identified as the highest metallicity CEMP-rs\nstar yet discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 10:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

The second mechanism is due to\nthe effect of parametric excitation of oscillations, when the internal moving\nparticle is comparable in mass with the main platform, and, as occurs, a\nnecessary condition for the acceleration is presence of friction. The\nparametric instability and the resulting acceleration of the sleigh turn out to\nbe bounded if the line of oscillations of the moving mass is displaced from the\ncenter of mass.

This\nstudy predicts the changes in battery capacity over time using a Bayesian\nnon-parametric approach based on Gaussian process regression. These changes can\nbe integrated against an arbitrary input sequence to predict capacity fade in a\nvariety of usage scenarios, forming a generalised health model. The approach\nnaturally incorporates varying current, voltage and temperature inputs, crucial\nfor enabling real world application. A key innovation is the feature selection\nstep, where arbitrary length current, voltage and temperature measurement\nvectors are mapped to fixed size feature vectors, enabling them to be\nefficiently used as exogenous variables. The approach is demonstrated on the\nopen-source NASA Randomised Battery Usage Dataset, with data of 26 cells aged\nunder randomized operational conditions. Using half of the cells for training,\nand half for validation, the method is shown to accurately predict non-linear\ncapacity fade, with a best case normalised root mean square error of 4.3%,\nincluding accurate estimation of prediction uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 11:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

The geometric assumptions as a rule\nconcern symmetry assumptions (the so called collineations). The latter\nintroduces the 1+3 decomposition of tensor fields in spacetime. The 1+3\ndecomposition results in two major results. The 1+3 decomposition of $u_{a;b}$\ndefines the kinematic variables of the model (expansion, rotation, shear and\n4-acceleration) and defines the kinematics of the gravitational model. The 1+3\ndecomposition of the energy momentum tensor representing all gravitating matter\nintroduces the dynamic variables of the model (energy density, the isotropic\npressure, the momentum transfer or heat flux vector and the traceless tensor of\nthe anisotropic pressure) as measured by the defined observers and define the\ndynamics of he model.

Several such quantitative\npredictors have been proposed in the literature, inferred mostly from\nphotospheric magnetograms and/or white-light observations. Two of them are the\nIsing energy and the sum of the total horizontal magnetic field gradient. The\nformer has been developed from line-of-sight magnetograms, while the latter\nuses sunspot detections and characteristics, based on continuum images. Aiming\nto include these parameters in an automated prediction scheme, we test their\napplicability on regular photospheric magnetic field observations provided by\nthe Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO). We test their efficiency as predictors of flaring\nactivity on a representative sample of active regions and investigate possible\nmodifications of these quantities. The Ising energy appears to be an efficient\npredictor, and the efficiency is even improved if it is modified to describe\ninteracting magnetic partitions or sunspot umbrae. The sum of the horizontal\nmagnetic field gradient appears to be slightly more promising than the three\nvariations of the Ising energy we implement in this article. The new predictors\nare also compared with two very promising predictors: the effective connected\nmagnetic field strength and the total unsigned non-neutralized current. Our\nanalysis shows that the efficiency of morphological predictors depends on\nprojection effects in a nontrivial way. All four new predictors are found\nuseful for inclusion in an automated flare forecasting facility, such as the\nFlare Likelihood and Region Eruption Forecasting (FLARECAST), but their\nutility, among others, will ultimately be determined by the validation effort\nunderway in the framework of the FLARECAST project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 12:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

By arguing for, and adopting, probability distributions as\nthese elements of reality instead, we demonstrate that the criterion of\nphysical reality is actually one of observable predictability.

The so-called metal poor (MP) component peaks at [Fe/H]~-0.4,\nwhile the metal rich (MR) one peaks at [Fe/H]$~+0.3. The total metallicity\ndistribution function is therefore bimodal, with a dip at [Fe/H]~0. The\nrelative fraction of the two components changes significantly across the bulge\narea. We provide, for the first time, the fractional contribution of the MP and\nMR stars to the stellar mass budget of the Galactic bulge, and its variation\nacross the bulge area. We find that MP stars make up 48% of the total stellar\nmass of the bulge, within the region |l|<10, |b|<9.5, with the remaining 52%\nmade up of MR stars. The latter dominate the mass budget at intermediate\nlatitudes |b|~4, but become marginal in the outer bulge (|b|>8). The MP\ncomponent is more axisymmetric than the MR one, and it is at least comparable,\nand possibly slightly dominant in the inner few degrees. As a result, the MP\ncomponent, which does not follow the main bar, is not marginal in terms of the\ntotal mass budget as previously thought, and this new observational evidence\nmust be included in bulge models. While the total radial velocity dispersion\nhas a trend that follows the total stellar mass, when we examine the velocity\ndispersion of each component individually, we find that MP stars have higher\nvelocity dispersion where they make up a smaller fraction of the stellar mass,\nand viceversa. This is due to the kinematical and spatial distribution of the\ntwo metallicity component being significantly different, as already discussed\nin the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 12:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

One of the simplest methods to reduce IN is to precede the OFDM\ndemodulator with a blanking non-linearity processor. In this respect, Selective\nMapping (SLM) applied to an OFDM signal before the transmitter does not only\nreduce Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) but also increases the resulting\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when blanking nonlinearity is applied at the\nreceiver.

If the optimized threshold calculation method is used, the output\nSNR with SLM OFDM will result in SNR gains of up to 8.6dB compared to the\nunmodified system, i.e. without implementing SLM. Moreover, by using SLM, we\nnot only get the advantage of low peak power, but also the need to calculate\noptimized threshold is eliminated, thereby reducing the additional computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Based on such a data\nset, we present an adapted version of the Hill estimator that shows greatly\nimproved behavior and we establish the asymptotic normality of this estimator.\nFor this adaptation the tail dependence between the variable of interest and\nthe related variable(s) plays an important role.

This problem derives its\ninterest from a variety of inference, learning, and sampling settings in\nmachine learning, computer vision, statistical physics, and theoretical\ncomputer science. While the problem of sampling from a static graphical model\nhas received considerable attention, theoretical works for its dynamic variants\nhave been largely lacking. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm\nthat can sample dynamically from a broad class of graphical models over\ndiscrete random variables. Our algorithm is parallel and Las Vegas: it knows\nwhen to stop and it outputs samples from the exact distribution. We also\nprovide sufficient conditions under which this algorithm runs in time\nproportional to the size of the update, on general graphical models as well as\nwell-studied specific spin systems. In particular we obtain, for the Ising\nmodel (ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic) and for the hardcore model the\nfirst dynamic sampling algorithms that can handle both edge and vertex updates\n(addition, deletion, change of functions), both efficient within regimes that\nare close to the respective uniqueness regimes, beyond which, even for the\nstatic and approximate sampling, no local algorithms were known or the problem\nitself is intractable. Our dynamic sampling algorithm relies on a local\nresampling algorithm and a new \"equilibrium\" property that is shown to be\nsatisfied by our algorithm at each step, and enables us to prove its\ncorrectness. This equilibrium property is robust enough to guarantee the\ncorrectness of our algorithm, helps us improve bounds on fast convergence on\nspecific models, and should be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:54:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2018 09:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

The formation and survival\nof vortices is of major importance for planet formation, because vortices act\nas particle traps and are therefore preferred locations of planetesimal\nformation. Recent studies showed that the vertical shear instability (VSI) is\ncapable of generating turbulence and small vortices in protoplanetary disks\nthat have the proper radial and vertical stratification and thermally relax on\nsufficiently short time scales. But the effect of the azimuthal extend of the\ndisk is often neglected as the disks azimuth is limited to $\\Delta \\phi \\leq\n\\pi/2$. We aim to investigate the influence of the azimuthal extent of the disk\non the long-term evolution of a protoplanetary disk and the possibility of\nlarge vortices forming. To this end, we perform 3-dimensional simulations for\nup to 1000 local orbits using different values of $\\Delta \\phi = \\pi/2 $ to\n$2\\pi$ for VSI in disks with a prescribed radial density and temperature\ngradient cooling on short timescales. We find the VSI capable of forming large\nvortices which can exist at least several hundred orbits in simulations\ncovering a disk with $\\Delta \\phi \\geq \\pi$. This suggests the VSI to be\ncapable to form vortices or at least to trigger vortex formation via a\nsecondary instability, e.g. Rossby Wave Instability or Kelvin Helmholtz\nInstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

At arbitrarily short wavelengths the unitarity\nis lost for each mode. Depending on the values of the gEEFToI parameters in the\nunitary gauge action, two scenarios can arise: in one, the coefficients of the\npolynomial become singular, flip signs at some physical wavelength and\nasymptote to a constant value as the wavelength of the mode is stretched to\ninfinity. Starting from the WKB vacuum, the two-point function is essentially\nsingular in the infinite IR limit. In the other case, the coefficients of the\ndispersion relation evolve monotonically from zero to a constant value in the\ninfinite IR. In order to have a finite power spectrum starting from the vacuum\nin this case, the mode function has to be an eigensolution of the Confluent\nHeun (CH) equation, which leads to a very confined parameter space for gEEFToI.\nFinally, I look at a solution of the CH equation which is regular in the\ninfinite IR limit and yields a finite power spectrum in either scenario.

It is found that the L\\'evy flights will be confined in\nthe sense of generalized central limit theorem if (i) the spacing between the\nteeth is sufficiently broad, and (ii) $n > 4-\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the fractal\ndimension of the flights. In particular, for the Cauchy flights ($\\mu = 1$),\n$n>3$. The study is motivated by recent observations of\nlocalization-delocalization of transport avalanches in banded flows in the Tore\nSupra tokamak and is intended to devise a theory basis to explain the observed\nphenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 11:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

Recently, reduced precision NN have been gaining popularity as\nthey require significantly less memory and computational resources compared to\nfloating point. This is particularly important in power constrained compute\nenvironments. However, in many cases a reduction in precision comes at a small\ncost to the accuracy of the resultant network. In this work, we investigate the\naccuracy-throughput trade-off for various parameter precision applied to\ndifferent types of NN models. We firstly propose a quantization training\nstrategy that allows reduced precision NN inference with a lower memory\nfootprint and competitive model accuracy. Then, we quantitatively formulate the\nrelationship between data representation and hardware efficiency. Our\nexperiments finally provide insightful observation. For example, one of our\ntests show 32-bit floating point is more hardware efficient than 1-bit\nparameters to achieve 99% MNIST accuracy. In general, 2-bit and 4-bit fixed\npoint parameters show better hardware trade-off on small-scale datasets like\nMNIST and CIFAR-10 while 4-bit provide the best trade-off in large-scale tasks\nlike AlexNet on ImageNet dataset within our tested problem domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 08:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

The QHF can be capable of color edge feature\nenhancement and noise resistance. It is flexible to use QHF by selecting\nsuitable parameters to handle different levels of noise. In particular, the\nquaternion analytic signal, which is an effective tool in color image\nprocessing, can also be produced by quaternion Hardy filtering with specific\nparameters. Based on the QHF and the improved Di Zenzo gradient operator, a\nnovel color edge detection algorithm is proposed. Importantly, it can be\nefficiently implemented by using the fast discrete quaternion Fourier transform\ntechnique. From the experimental results, we conclude that the minimum PSNR\nimprovement rate is 2.3% and minimum SSIM improvement rate is 30.2% on the\nDataset 3. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms\nseveral widely used algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 09:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 12:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

The solutions are based\non the physical principle of maintaining local gauge invariance in the Furry\npicture Lagrangian when N external fields can undergo independent gauge\ntransformations. The solutions can be expressed in terms of the Hamilton Jacobi\naction and a gauge invariant effective particle momentum in the ensemble of\nexternal fields. Rotations of the effective particle momentum, which preserve\nlocal gauge invariance, are introduced into the action using matrix calculus.\nThe set of such rotations provides the class of new solutions constituting a\nfamily of Volkov like solutions for one external field. When applied to two or\nmore non co propagating external fields, the rotational symmetry provides\ncounter terms which decouple the fields. The bound state equations of motion\nbecome solvable for any number of non co propagating external fields. Through\nangular spectral decomposition, which represents electromagnetic fields of any\nform as a spatial Fourier series of non co propagating plane waves, the new\nsolutions described here can be applied to strong field physics problems in any\nexternal electromagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 16:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-06"}

The\ntheory of self-organized criticality (SOC) was proposed to explain their\norigins. A longstanding principle of SOC is the \\emph{separation of timescales}\naxiom. It dictates that external input is delivered to the system at a much\nslower rate compared to the timescale of internal dynamics. The statistics of\nneural avalanches in the brain was demonstrated to follow a power law,\nindicating closeness to a critical state. Moreover, criticality was shown to be\na beneficial state for various computations leading to the hypothesis, that the\nbrain is a SOC system. However, for neuronal systems that are constantly\nbombarded by incoming signals, separation of timescales assumption is\nunnatural. Recently it was experimentally demonstrated that a proper correction\nof the avalanche detection algorithm to account for the increased drive during\ntask performance leads to a change of the power-law exponent from $1.5$ to\napproximately $1.3$, but there is so far no theoretical explanation for this\nchange. Here we investigate the importance of timescales separation, by partly\nabandoning it in various models. We achieve it by allowing for external input\nduring the avalanche, without compromising the separation of avalanches. We\ndevelop an analytic treatment and provide numerical simulations of a simple\nneuronal model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 06:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The second issue is addressed through a multi-information source\noptimization framework that identifies, given current knowledge, the next best\ninformation source to query and where in the input space to query it via a\nnovel value-gradient policy. The querying decision takes into account the\nability to learn correlations between information sources, the resource cost of\nquerying an information source, and what a query is expected to provide in\nterms of improvement over the current state. The framework is demonstrated on\nthe optimization of a dual-phase steel to maximize its strength-normalized\nstrain hardening rate.
