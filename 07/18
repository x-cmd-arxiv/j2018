A given basis can be\ndecomposed into a uniquely defined sequence of bases of minors, such that these\nbases have an internal/external activity equal to 1/0 or 0/1 (in the sense of\nTutte polynomial activities). This decomposition, which we call the active\nfiltration/partition of the basis, refines the known partition of the ground\nset into internal and external elements with respect to a given basis. It can\nbe built by a certain closure operator, which we call the active closure. It\nrelies only on the fundamental bipartite graph of the basis and can be\nexpressed also as a decomposition of general bipartite graphs on a linearly\nordered set of vertices.\n  From this, first, structurally, we obtain that the set of all bases can be\ncanonically partitioned and decomposed in terms of such bases of minors induced\nby filtrations. Second, enumeratively, we derive an expression of the Tutte\npolynomial of a matroid in terms of beta invariants of minors. This expression\nrefines at the same time the classical expressions in terms of basis activities\nand orientation activities (if the matroid is oriented), and the well-known\nconvolution formula for the Tutte polynomial. Third, in a companion paper of\nthe same series (No. 2.b), we use this decomposition of matroid bases, along\nwith a similar decomposition of oriented matroids, and along with a bijection\nin the 1/0 activity case from a previous paper (No. 1), to define the canonical\nactive bijection between orientations/signatures/reorientations and spanning\ntrees/simplices/bases of a graph/real hyperplane arrangement/oriented matroid,\nas well as various related bijections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 12:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

Tilt of Dirac cone can be realized in a number of\nmaterials, including deformed graphene, surface state of topological\ncrystalline insulator, and certain organic compound. We study how Dirac cone\ntilting affects the low-energy properties by presenting a renormalization group\nanalysis of the Coulomb interaction and quenched disorder. Random scalar\npotential or random vector potential along the tilting direction cannot exist\non its own as it always dynamically generates a new type of disorder, which\ndominates at low energies and turns the system into a compressible diffusive\nmetal. Consequently, the fermions acquire a finite disorder scattering rate.\nMoreover, the isolated band-touching point is replaced by a bulk Fermi arc in\nthe Brillouin zone. These results are not qualitatively changed when the\nCoulomb interaction is incorporated. In comparison, random mass and random\nvector potential along the non-tilting direction can exist individually,\nwithout generating other types of disorder. They both suppress tilt at low\nenergies, and do not produce bulk Fermi arc. Upon taking the Coulomb\ninteraction into account, the system enters into a stable quantum critical\nstate, in which the fermion field acquires a finite anomalous dimension but the\ndynamical exponent $z=1$.

The application of a weak\nmagnetic field reduces the singlet yield of a singlet-born radical pair,\nwhereas the application of a strong magnetic field increases the singlet yield.\nThe high field effect arises from energy conservation: when the magnetic field\nis stronger than the sum of the hyperfine fields in the two radicals, ${\\rm\nS}\\to {\\rm T}_{\\pm}$ transitions become energetically forbidden, thereby\nreducing the number of pathways for singlet to triplet interconversion. The low\nfield effect arises from symmetry breaking: the application of a weak magnetic\nfield lifts degeneracies among the zero field eigenstates and increases the\nnumber of pathways for singlet to triplet interconversion. However, the details\nof this effect are more subtle, and have not previously been properly\nexplained. Here we present a complete analysis of the low field effect in a\nradical pair containing a single proton, and in a radical pair in which one of\nthe radicals contains a large number of hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins. We\nfind that the new transitions that occur when the field is switched on are\nbetween ${\\rm S}$ and ${\\rm T}_0$ in both cases, and not between ${\\rm S}$ and\n${\\rm T}_{\\pm}$ as has previously been claimed. We then illustrate this result\nby using it in conjunction with semiclassical spin dynamics simulations to\naccount for the observation of a biphasic--triphasic--biphasic transition with\nincreasing magnetic field strength in the magnetic field effect on the\ntime-dependent survival probability of a photoexcited\ncarotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene radical pair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

Based on the CO line data, we find that these sites are not physically\nconnected, and contain at least one filament (with length > 7 pc). The observed\nline masses (M_line,obs) of the filaments associated with V582 and IRAS\n05231+3512 are ~37 and ~28 M_sun/pc, respectively. These filaments are\ncharacterized as thermally supercritical, and harbor several clumps. Groups of\ninfrared-excess sources and massive B-type stars are observed toward the\nfilament containing V582, while a very little star formation (SF) activity is\nfound around IRAS 05231+3512. Our results favour radial collapse scenario in\nthe filaments harboring V582 and IRAS 05231+3512. In the site S234, two\nfilaments (i.e. ns1 (M_line,obs ~130 M_sun/pc) and ns2 (M_line,obs ~45\nM_sun/pc)) are identified as thermally supercritical. An extended temperature\nstructure at 27-30 K surrounds a relatively cold (~19 K) ~8.9 pc long filament\nns1. At least four condensations (M_clump ~70-300 M_sun) are seen in ns1, and\nare devoid of the GMRT 610 MHz radio emission. The filament ns2 hosting clumps\nis devoid of ongoing SF, and could be at an early stage of fragmentation. An\nintense SF activity, having the SF efficiency ~3.3% and SF rate ~40-20\nM_sun/Myr (for t_sf ~1-2 Myr), is observed in ns1. The feedback of massive\nstars in S234 seems to explain the observed SF in the filament ns1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

The present paper is intended to state\nthe main results in the particular case, and more widespread language, of\ngraphs. We associate any directed graph, defined on a linearly ordered set of\nedges, with one particular of its spanning trees, which we call its active\nspanning tree. For any graph on a linearly ordered set of edges, this yields a\nsurjective mapping from orientations onto spanning trees, which preserves\nactivities (for orientations in the sense of Las Vergnas, for spanning trees in\nthe sense of Tutte), as well as some partitions (or filtrations) of the edge\nset associated with orientations and spanning trees. It yields a canonical\nbijection between classes of orientations and spanning trees, as well as a\nrefined bijection between all orientations and edge subsets, containing various\nnoticeable bijections [...]. Several constructions of independent interest are\ninvolved. The basic case concerns bipolar orientations, which are in bijection\nwith their fully optimal spanning trees, as proved in a previous paper, and as\ncomputed in a companion paper. We give a canonical decomposition of a directed\ngraph on a linearly ordered set of edges into acyclic/cyclic bipolar directed\ngraphs. Considering all orientations of a graph, we obtain an expression of the\nTutte polynomial in terms of products of beta invariants of minors, a\nremarkable partition of the set of orientations into activity classes, and a\nsimple expression of the Tutte polynomial using four orientation activity\nparameters. We derive a similar decomposition theorem for spanning trees.

Our framework\nprovides a versatile tool for the analysis of anomalies in realistic lattice\nmodels as well as a source of simple physical intuition for understanding\nstrained and magnetized inhomogeneous Weyl semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 18:29:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 15:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

Under those conditions, standard\napproximations used in model atmosphere codes are no longer appropriate.\nUnfortunately, the majority of cool He-rich white dwarfs show no spectral\nfeatures, giving us no opportunities to put more elaborate models to the test.\nIn the few cases where spectral features are observed (such as in cool DQ or DZ\nstars), current models completely fail to reproduce the spectroscopic data,\nsignaling shortcomings in our theoretical framework. In order to fully trust\nparameters derived solely from the energy distribution, it is thus important to\nat least succeed in reproducing the spectra of the few coolest stars exhibiting\nspectral features, especially since such stars possess even less extreme\nphysical conditions due to the presence of heavy elements. In this paper, we\nrevise every building block of our model atmosphere code in order to eliminate\nlow-density approximations. Our updated white dwarf atmosphere code\nincorporates state-of-the-art constitutive physics suitable for the conditions\nfound in cool helium-rich stars (DC and DZ white dwarfs).

For numerical implementation the pricing of\nderivatives with Libor market models is mainly carried out with Monte Carlo\nsimulation. The PDE grid approach is not particularly feasible due to Curse of\nDimensionality. The standard Monte Carlo method for American/Bermudan swaption\npricing more or less uses regression to estimate expected value as a linear\ncombination of basis functions (Longstaff and Schwartz). However, Monte Carlo\nmethod only provides the lower bound for American option price. Another\ncomplexity is the computation of the sensitivities of the option, the so-called\nGreeks, which are fundamental for a trader's hedging activity. Recently, an\nalternative numerical method based on deep learning and backward stochastic\ndifferential equations appeared in quite a few researches.

The primary\nmethod for their characterization in a 1D topological superconductor, is\nmeasuring the tunneling current into the edge of the superconductor. Presently,\nthe hallmark of a localized Majorana edge-state is an emergent quantized\nzero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). However, such a conductance peak can also\nresult from other mechanisms; e.g., crossing (and sticking) of two branches of\na standard Andreev bound state, or a soft potential at the edge of the\nsuperconductor. Since the emergence of a 'Majorana-ZBCP' must be accompanied by\nan opening of a topological gap in the bulk, we performed two simultaneous\ntunneling measurements: one in the bulk and another at the edge of the 1D\nsuperconductor. Measurements were performed with an InAs nanowire in-situ\ncoated with epitaxial aluminum. For particular gate-tuning of the chemical\npotential in the wire and a Zeeman field parallel to the wire, we observed a\nclosing of the superconducting bulk-gap followed by its reopening concomitant\nwith the appearance of a ZBCP at the edge. We note that a ZBCP could also be\nobserved with different tuning parameters without an observed reopening of the\nbulk-gap. This demonstrates the importance of simultaneous probing of the bulk\nand edge when searching for a Majorana edge-state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 19:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

Disparate results corresponding to enhancement, suppression and null\neffect of the photonic environment have led to a lack of consensus between the\ntraditional theory of FRET and experiments. Here we show that the quantum\nelectrodynamic theory of FRET near an engineered nanophotonic environment is\nexactly equivalent to an effective near-field model describing electrostatic\ndipole-dipole interactions. This leads to an intuitive and rigorously exact\ndescription of FRET bridging the gap between experimental observations and\ntheoretical interpretations. We show that the widely used concept of the\nPurcell factor is only important for understanding spontaneous emission and is\nan incorrect figure of merit for analyzing FRET. To this end, we analyze the\nfigures of merit which characterize FRET in a photonic environment: (1) the\nFRET rate enhancement factor ($F_{ET}$), (2) the FRET efficiency enhancement\nfactor ($F_{eff}$) and (3) the two-point spectral density ($S_{EE}$) governing\nFRET analogous to the local density of states that controls spontaneous\nemission. Counterintuitive to existing knowledge, we show that suppression of\nthe Purcell factor is in fact necessary for enhancing the efficiency of the\nFRET process. We place fundamental bounds on the FRET figures of merit arising\nfrom material absorption in the photonic environment as well as key properties\nof emitters including intrinsic quantum efficiencies and orientational\ndependence. Finally, we use our approach to conclusively explain recent\nexperiments and predict regimes where the FRET rate is expected to be enhanced,\nsuppressed or remain the same.

In a recent\ncollaboration between engineers, experimental physicists and astronomers in\nValparaiso, Chile, we are gaining expertise in the production of light carbon\nfiber polymer reinforced mirrors. The working principle consists in replicating\na glass, or other substrate, mandrel surface with the mirrored adequate\ncurvature, surface characteristics and general shape. Once the carbon fiber\nbase has hardened, previous studies have shown that it can be coated (aluminum)\nusing standard coating processes/techniques designed for glass-based mirrors.\nThe resulting surface quality is highly dependent on the temperature and\nhumidity control among other variables. Current efforts are focused on\nimproving the smoothness of the resulting surfaces to meet near/mid infrared\nspecifications, overcoming, among others, possible deteriorations derived from\nthe replication process. In a second step, at the validation and quality\ncontrol stage, the mirrors are characterized using simple/traditional tools\nlike spherometers (down to micron precision), but also an optical bench with a\nShack-Hartman wavefront sensor. This research line is developed in parallel\nwith a more classical glass-based approach, and in both cases we are\nprototyping at the small scale of few tens of cms.

In this\nwork, we consider symmetry breaking problems of maximal independent set (MIS)\nand maximal matching (MM), which are among the most intensively studied\nproblems in distributed/parallel computing, in MPC.\n  These problems are known to admit efficient MPC algorithms if the space per\nmachine is near-linear in $n$, the number of vertices in the graph. This space\nrequirement however, as observed in the literature, is often significantly\nlarger than we can afford; especially when the input graph is sparse. In a\nsharp contrast, in the truly sublinear regime of $n^{1-\\Omega(1)}$ space per\nmachine, all the known algorithms take $\\log^{\\Omega(1)} n$ rounds which is\nconsidered inefficient.\n  Motivated by this shortcoming, we parametrize our algorithms by the\narboricity $\\alpha$ of the input graph, which is a well-received measure of its\nsparsity. We show that both MIS and MM admit $O(\\sqrt{\\log \\alpha}\\cdot\\log\\log\n\\alpha + \\log^2\\log n)$ round algorithms using $O(n^\\epsilon)$ space per\nmachine for any constant $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1)$ and using $\\widetilde{O}(m)$\ntotal space. Therefore, for the wide range of sparse graphs with small\narboricity---such as minor-free graphs, bounded-genus graphs or bounded\ntreewidth graphs---we get an $O(\\log^2 \\log n)$ round algorithm which\nexponentially improves prior algorithms.\n  By known reductions, our results also imply a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation of\nmaximum cardinality matching, a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation of maximum\nweighted matching, and a 2-approximation of minimum vertex cover with\nessentially the same round complexity and memory requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 23:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 03:53:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 17:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

However, the relationships between the tasks are complicated in\npractice, especially when the number of involved tasks scales up. When two\ntasks are of weak relevance, they may compete or even distract each other\nduring joint training of shared parameters, and as a consequence undermine the\nlearning of all the tasks. This will raise destructive interference which\ndecreases learning efficiency of shared parameters and lead to low quality loss\nlocal optimum w.r.t. shared parameters.

Both purposes require us to assume some functional form\nof the ellipticity distribution, and as a proof of principle we take two toy\ndistributions.

This has\nmotivated recent investigation of practical techniques to improve code layout\nat both compile time and link time. Although post-link optimizers had some\nsuccess in the past, no recent work has explored their benefits in the context\nof modern data-center applications.\n  In this paper, we present BOLT, a post-link optimizer built on top of the\nLLVM framework. Utilizing sample-based profiling, BOLT boosts the performance\nof real-world applications even for highly optimized binaries built with both\nfeedback-driven optimizations (FDO) and link-time optimizations (LTO). We\ndemonstrate that post-link performance improvements are complementary to\nconventional compiler optimizations, even when the latter are done at a\nwhole-program level and in the presence of profile information. We evaluated\nBOLT on both Facebook data-center workloads and open-source compilers. For\ndata-center applications, BOLT achieves up to 8.0% performance speedups on top\nof profile-guided function reordering and LTO. For the GCC and Clang compilers,\nour evaluation shows that BOLT speeds up their binaries by up to 20.4% on top\nof FDO and LTO, and up to 52.1% if the binaries are built without FDO and LTO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 01:54:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 19:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

This argues that the area of a black hole is proportional to the\ncoherent information, which is minus the conditional entropy, defined only in\nthe quantum regime, from the outside, to positive-energy particles inside it.\nThis hints that negative-energy particles inside a black hole behave as if they\nhave negative entropy. Our result suggests that the black holes store pure\nquantum information, rather than classical information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 02:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 13:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 04:34:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 07:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 12:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 01:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

We extend this method to the Cox model for survival data,\nincorporating modifiers that are either fixed or varying in time into the\npartial likelihood. For example, this allows modeling of survival times that\ndiffer based on interactions of genes with age, gender, or other demographic\ninformation. The optimization is done by blockwise coordinate descent on a\nsecond order approximation of the objective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 04:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

Here, we report two clear differences in their\nphysical properties. The first one is the occurrence of Fermi level pinning at\nthe metal/h-BN interface, unlike that at the metal/SiO2 interface. The second\none is that the carrier of Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling through h-BN is a\nhole, which is opposite to an electron in the case of SiO2. These unique\ncharacteristics are verified by I-V measurements in the graphene/h-BN/metal\nheterostructure device with the aid of a numerical simulation, where the\nbarrier height of graphene can be modulated by a back gate voltage owing to its\nlow density of states. Furthermore, from a systematic investigation using a\nvariety of metals, it is confirmed that the hole F-N tunneling current is a\ngeneral characteristic because the Fermi levels of metals are pinned in the\nsmall energy range around ~3.5 eV from the top of the conduction band of h-BN,\nwith a pinning factor of 0.30. The accurate energy band alignment at the\nh-BN/metal interface provides practical knowledge for 2D heterostructure\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 04:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

The knapsack problem for a finitely\ngenerated group $G$ is the following decision problem: given a tuple $(g, g_1,\n\\ldots, g_k)$ of elements of $G$, are there natural numbers $n_1, \\ldots, n_k\n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $g = g_1^{n_1} \\cdots g_k^{n_k}$ holds in $G$?\nMyasnikov, Nikolaev, and Ushakov proved that for every (Gromov-)hyperbolic\ngroup, the knapsack problem can be solved in polynomial time. In this paper,\nthe precise complexity of the knapsack problem for hyperbolic group is\ndetermined: for every hyperbolic group $G$, the knapsack problem belongs to the\ncomplexity class $\\mathsf{LogCFL}$, and it is $\\mathsf{LogCFL}$-complete if $G$\ncontains a free group of rank two.

In a configuration formed by an interior giant planet\nand an exterior massive debris disk, where the mass is accounted for by the 50\nlargest objects in the disk, the strongest mean motion resonances of the giant,\nlocated along the belt, are replenished with new material (test particles) due\nto the influence of the 50 massive objects. Once in resonance, slow chaotic\ndiffusion stirs the orbital elements of the cometary nuclei enough to encounter\nthe giant and to be scattered by it. When the disk is massive enough, both\nresonant and non-resonant particles are stirred quickly to encounter the giant\nand form an scattered disk component, greatly increasing the rate for the\ndelivery of cometary material to the inner part of the system. This mechanism\nis applicable both to the solar system and extrasolar systems in general.\nPreliminary results, using a disk as massive as the classical Kuiper belt,\nindicate that the mechanism here proposed can account for about a tenth of the\nrequired injection rate to maintain the population of ecliptic comets in steady\nstate. In a more massive belt of 0.25 M$_\\oplus$, an estimated rate of around\n0.6 new comets per year is found. Such a high rate would pose a serious risk\nfor the habitability of rocky interior planets, yet would resemble the late\nheavy bombardment that was present in the early solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 05:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Explicitly, we develop dynamical\nfeatures of the measuring uncertainty via entropy in a practical model where a\nstationary particle interacts with its surrounding environment while another\nparticle --- serving as a quantum memory reservoir --- undergoes freefall in\nthe vicinity of the event horizon of the Schwarzschild space-time. It shows\nhigher Hawking temperatures would give rise to an inflation of the entropic\nuncertainty on the measured particle. This is suggestive the measurement\nuncertainty is strongly correlated with degree of mixing present in the\nevolving particles. Additionally, based on information flow theory, we provide\na physical interpretation for the observed dynamical behaviors related with the\nentropic uncertainty in such a realistic scenario. Finally, an efficient\nstrategy is proposed to reduce the uncertainty by non-tracing-preserved\noperations. Therefore, our explorations may improve the understanding of the\ndynamic entropic uncertainty in a curved space-time, and illustrate predictions\nof quantum measurements in relativistic quantum information sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 08:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}

In fact, in a\ndistributed shared memory setting, we find a counter-example to the theorem\nconcerning classical randomized online algorithms which shows that, if there is\na $c$-competitive randomized algorithm against an adaptive offline adversary,\nthen there is a $c$-competitive deterministic algorithm [Ben-David, Borodin,\nKarp, Tardos, Wigderson, 1994]. In a distributed setting, there is additional\nlack of knowledge concerning what the other processes have done. There is also\nadditional power for the adversary, having control of the scheduler which\ndecides when each process is allowed to take steps.\n  We consider the list accessing problem, which is a benchmark problem for\nsequential online algorithms. In the distributed version of this problem, each\nprocess has its own finite sequence of requests to a shared list. The scheduler\narises as a major issue in its competitive analysis. We introduce two different\nadversaries, which differ in how they are allowed to schedule processes, and\nuse them to perform competitive analysis of distributed list accessing. We\nprove tight upper and lower bounds on combinatorial properties of merges of the\nrequest sequences, which we use in the analysis. Our analysis shows that the\neffects of the adversarial scheduler can be quite significant, dominating the\nusual quality loss due to lack of information about the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 08:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

Radio-loud active galactic nuclei in the early Universe are rare.\nThe quasars J0906+6930 at redshift z=5.47 and J2102+6015 at z=4.57 stand out\nfrom the known sample with their compact emission on milliarcsecond (mas)\nangular scale with high (0.1-Jy level) flux densities measured at GHz radio\nfrequencies.

By means of VLBI imaging we can\nreveal the inner radio structure of quasars and model their brightness\ndistribution to better understand the geometry of the jet and the physics of\nthe sources. Methods. We present sensitive high-resolution VLBI images of\nJ0906+6930 and J2102+6015 at two observing frequencies, 2.3 and 8.6 GHz. The\ndata were taken in an astrometric observing programme involving a global\nfive-element radio telescope array. We combined the data from five different\nepochs from 2017 February to August. Results. For one of the highest redshift\nblazars known, J0906+6930, we present the first-ever VLBI image obtained at a\nfrequency below 8 GHz. Based on our images at 2.3 and 8.6 GHz, we confirm that\nthis source has a sharply bent helical inner jet structure within ~3 mas from\nthe core. The quasar J2102+6015 shows an elongated radio structure in the\neast-west direction within the innermost ~2 mas that can be described with a\nsymmetric three-component brightness distribution model at 8.6 GHz. Because of\ntheir non-pointlike mas-scale structure, these sources are not ideal as\nastrometric reference objects.

The model integrates random relocation moves\nover the links of the network with local interactions depending on the node\noccupation probabilities. The model is highly versatile, as the motion of the\nwalkers can be fed on topological properties of the nodes, such as their\ndegree, while any general nonlinear function of the occupation probability of a\nnode can be considered as local reaction term. In addition to this, the\nrelative strength of reaction and relocation can be tuned at will, depending on\nthe specific application being examined. We derive an analytical expression for\nthe occupation probability of the walkers at equilibrium in the most general\ncase. We show that it depends on different order derivatives of the local\nreaction functions and not only on the degree of a node, but also on the\naverage degree of its neighbours at various distances. For such a reason,\nreactive random walkers are very sensitive to the structure of a network and\nare a powerful way to detect network properties such as symmetries or\ndegree-degree correlations. As possible applications, we first discuss how the\noccupation probability of reactive random walkers can be used to define novel\nmeasures of functional centrality for the nodes of a network.

The set of jet shapes includes the first radial moment or angularity, $g$;\nthe momentum dispersion, $p_{\\rm T}D$; and the difference between the leading\nand sub-leading constituent track transverse momentum, $LeSub$. These\nobservables provide complementary information on the jet fragmentation and can\nconstrain different aspects of the theoretical description of jet-medium\ninteractions. The jet shapes were measured for a small resolution parameter $R\n= 0.2$ and were fully corrected to particle level. The observed jet shape\nmodifications indicate that in-medium fragmentation is harder and more\ncollimated than vacuum fragmentation as obtained by PYTHIA calculations, which\nwere validated with the measurements of the jet shapes in proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The comparison of the measured distributions\nto templates for quark and gluon-initiated jets indicates that in-medium\nfragmentation resembles that of quark jets in vacuum. We further argue that the\nobserved modifications are not consistent with a totally coherent energy loss\npicture where the jet loses energy as a single colour charge, suggesting that\nthe medium resolves the jet structure at the angular scales probed by our\nmeasurements ($R=0.2$). Furthermore, we observe that small-$R$ jets can help to\nisolate purely energy loss effects from other effects that contribute to the\nmodifications of the jet shower in medium such as the correlated background or\nmedium response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 10:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 19:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

We present the first detailed study of highly eccentric BNS\nsystems with full (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations using consistent\ninitial conditions, i.e., setups which are in agreement with the Einstein\nequations and with the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics in\nequilibrium. Overall, our simulations cover two different equations of state\n(EOSs), two different spin configurations, and three to four different initial\neccentricities for each pairing of EOS and spin. We extract from the simulated\nwaveforms the frequency of the f-mode oscillations induced during close\nencounters before the merger of the two stars. The extracted frequency is in\ngood agreement with f-mode oscillations of individual stars for the\nirrotational cases, which allows an independent measure of the supranuclear\nequation of state not accessible for binaries on quasi-circular orbits. The\nenergy stored in these f-mode oscillations can be as large as $10^{-3}M_\\odot\n\\sim 10^{51}$ erg, even with a soft EOS. In order to estimate the stored\nenergy, we also examine the effects of mode mixing due to the stars' offset\nfrom the origin on the f-mode contribution to the GW signal. While in general\n(eccentric) neutron star mergers produce bright electromagnetic counterparts,\nwe find that the luminosity decreases when the eccentricity becomes too large,\ndue to a decrease of the ejecta mass.

For convincing conclusions, analysis methods are\nneeded which offer an unambiguous comparison between data and theory while\nallowing reliable estimates of uncertainties. The Matrix Element Method (MEM)\nis a Maximum Likelihood method which is especially tailored for signal searches\nand parameter estimation at colliders. The MEM has proven to be beneficial due\nto optimal use of the available information and a clean statistical\ninterpretation of the results. But it has a big drawback: In its original\nformulation, the likelihood calculation is intrinsically limited to the leading\nperturbative order in the coupling. Higher-order corrections improve the\naccuracy of theoretical predictions and allow for unambiguous field-theoretical\ninterpretation of the extracted information. In this work, the MEM\nincorporating corrections of next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD by defining\nevent weights suited for the likelihood calculation is presented for the first\ntime. These weights also enable the generation of unweighted events following\nthe cross section calculated at NLO accuracy. The method is demonstrated for\ntop-quark events. The top-quark mass is determined with the MEM at NLO accuracy\nfrom the generated events. The extracted estimators are in agreement with the\ninput values from the event generation. Repeating the mass determinations from\nthe same events, without NLO corrections in the predictions, results in biased\nestimators. These shifts may not be accounted for by estimated theoretical\nuncertainties rendering the estimation of the theoretical uncertainties\nunreliable in the leading-order analysis. The results emphasise the importance\nof the inclusion of NLO corrections into the MEM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 10:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

This article proposes a framework for the compression\nof temporal graphs, that is for the compression of graphs that evolve with\ntime. This framework first builds on a simple and limited scheme, exploiting\nstructural equivalence for the lossless compression of static graphs, then\ngeneralises it to the lossy compression of link streams, a recent formalism for\nthe study of temporal graphs. Such generalisation relies on the natural\nextension of (bidimensional) relational data by the addition of a third\ntemporal dimension. Moreover, we introduce an information-theoretic measure to\nquantify and to control the information that is lost during compression, as\nwell as an algebraic characterisation of the space of possible compression\npatterns to enhance the expressiveness of the initial compression scheme.

Standard methods imply\neither the need for many N-body simulations in order to obtain an accurate\nestimate, or a precise theoretical model. We combine these approaches by\nconstructing a likelihood function conditioned on simulated and theoretical\ncovariances, consistently propagating noise from the finite number of\nsimulations and uncertainty in the theoretical model itself using an\ninformative Inverse-Wishart prior. Unlike standard methods, our approach allows\nthe required number of simulations to be less than the number of summary\nstatistics. We recover the linear 'shrinkage' covariance estimator in the\ncontext of a Bayesian data model, and test our marginal likelihood on simulated\nmock power spectrum estimates. We conduct a thorough investigation into the\nimpact of prior confidence in different choices of covariance models on the\nquality of model fits and parameter variances. In a simplified setting we find\nthat the number of simulations required can be reduced if one is willing to\naccept a mild degradation in the quality of model fits, finding that even\nweakly informative priors can help to reduce the simulation requirements. We\nidentify the correlation matrix of the summary statistics as a key quantity\nrequiring careful modelling.

We\ndevelop algorithms to (i) compute the largest approximate differential\nequivalence; (ii) construct an approximate quotient model from the original one\nvia an appropriate parameter perturbation; and (iii) provide a formal\ncertificate on the quality of the approximation as an error bound, computed as\nan over-approximation of the reachable set of the perturbed model. Finally, we\napply approximate differential equivalences to study the effect of parametric\ntolerances in models of symmetric electric circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 12:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

It is natural to explore their middle ground and pursue a hybrid image\nprior capable of achieving the best in both worlds. In this paper, we propose a\nsystematic approach of achieving this goal called Structured Analysis Sparse\nCoding (SASC). Specifically, a structured sparse prior is learned from\nextrinsic training data via a deep convolutional neural network (in a similar\nway to previous learning-based approaches); meantime another structured sparse\nprior is internally estimated from the input observation image (similar to\nprevious model-based approaches). Two structured sparse priors will then be\ncombined to produce a hybrid prior incorporating the knowledge from both\ndomains. To manage the computational complexity, we have developed a novel\nframework of implementing hybrid structured sparse coding processes by deep\nconvolutional neural networks.

While coherent effects are thought to be at the basis of their high\nefficiency, the relationship between structure, coherence and functionality is\nstill an open problem. We analyze natural nanotubes present in Green Sulfur\nBacteria. We show that they have the ability to support macroscopic coherent\nstates, i.e. delocalized excitonic states coherently spread over many\nmolecules, even at room temperature.\n  Specifically, assuming a canonical thermal state, in natural structures we\nfind a large thermal coherence length, of the order of 1000 molecules. By\ncomparing natural structure with other mathematical models, we show that this\nmacroscopic coherence cannot be explained either by the magnitude of the\nnearest-neighbour coupling between the molecules, which would induce a thermal\ncoherence length of the order of 10 molecules, or by the presence of long-range\ninteractions between the molecules. Indeed we prove that the existence of\nmacroscopic coherent states is an emergent property of such structures due to\nthe interplay between geometry and cooperativity (superradiance and\nsuper-transfer). In order to prove this, we give evidence that the lowest part\nof the spectrum of natural systems is determined by a cooperatively enhanced\ncoupling (super-transfer) between the eigenstates of modular sub-units of the\nwhole structure. Due to this enhanced coupling strength, the density of states\nis lowered close to the ground state, thus boosting the thermal coherence\nlength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 13:39:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 14:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Comparative experiments with baseline\napproaches show that the samples queried with our proposed method, where both\nabove contributions are combined, result in significantly improved segmentation\nperformance for this active learning task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 14:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Determining the\nmaximum modularity of a graph is known to be NP-complete in general, and in\npractice a range of heuristics are used to construct partitions of the\nvertex-set which give lower bounds on the maximum modularity but without any\nguarantee on how close these bounds are to the true maximum. In this paper we\ninvestigate the parameterised complexity of determining the maximum modularity\nwith respect to various standard structural parameterisations of the input\ngraph G. We show that the problem belongs to FPT when parameterised by the size\nof a minimum vertex cover for G, and is solvable in polynomial time whenever\nthe treewidth or max leaf number of G is bounded by some fixed constant; we\nalso obtain an FPT algorithm, parameterised by treewidth, to compute any\nconstant-factor approximation to the maximum modularity.

Here, we study correlations between the radio and\nunabsorbed broad-band X-ray fluxes, the latter providing good estimates of the\nbolometric flux. We consider GX 339--4, the benchmark object for the main\nbranch of the correlation, and H1743--322, the first source found to be an\noutlier of the correlation. The obtained power-law dependencies of the radio\nflux on the bolometric flux have significantly different indices from those\nfound for the narrow X-ray bands. Also, the radio/bolometric flux correlations\nfor the rise of the outbursts are found to be significantly different from\nthose for the outburst decline. This points to a possible existence of a jet\nhysteresis in the radio/X-ray source evolution, in addition to that seen in the\nhardness/flux diagram of low-mass X-ray binaries. The correlation during the\nrise of the outbursts is similar for both GX 339--4 and H1743--322. The\ncorrelation for the decline of the outbursts for H1743--322 lies below that of\nGX 339--4 at intermediate X-ray fluxes, whereas it approaches the standard\ncorrelation at lower X-ray luminosities.

In addition we propose a dark matter (DM) candidate that meets all\nknown properties of DM. Looking for a minimal model that satisfies the above\nconditions leads us to extending the Standard Model (SM) of fundamental\ninteractions by adding a complex singlet scalar $S$. We impose the $CP$ and\n$Z_2$ symmetries on the scalar potential. With the complex vacuum expectation\nvalue of $S$ at the temperature higher than the EW phase transition, the $CP$\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken and a strong first-order electro-weak phase\ntransition is easily realized.

In this paper, we\npresent a real-time stereo vision system used for road surface 3-D\nreconstruction. The proposed system is developed from our previously published\n3-D reconstruction algorithm where the perspective view of the target image is\nfirst transformed into the reference view, which not only increases the\ndisparity accuracy but also improves the processing speed. Then, the\ncorrelation cost between each pair of blocks is computed and stored in two 3-D\ncost volumes. To adaptively aggregate the matching costs from neighbourhood\nsystems, bilateral filtering is performed on the cost volumes. This greatly\nreduces the ambiguities during stereo matching and further improves the\nprecision of the estimated disparities. Finally, the subpixel resolution is\nachieved by conducting a parabola interpolation and the subpixel disparity map\nis used to reconstruct the 3-D road surface.

With the aid of the\nlarge-scale uniform linear array (ULA) at the transmitter, we design a\nbeamforming network to generate multiple parallel beamforming branches, each\ntransmitting signal pointing to one particular angle.

Kurtz. The\ncontraction produces a diffusion term with a state dependent diffusion matrix,\nD, that arises from the coupling matrix, S, in the LE. This S connected the\nnoise terms to the channel subunit variables in the LE. Fox and Lu and many\nothers later on observed that SS = D. Since D was determined by the contraction\nof the MC equations into the FP equation, this left the problem of determining\nthe square root matrix, S, for every time step of the simulation. Since this is\ntime consuming, Fox and Lu introduced simplified models not requiring the\nsquare root of a matrix. Subsequently, numerous studies were published that\nshowed the several shortcomings of these simplified models. In 2011, Goldwyn et\nal. [6] rediscovered the overlooked original matrix dependent approach in the\nFox-Lu 1994 paper. They showed that it produced results in very good agreement\nwith the MC results. In 1991, Fox and Keizer [7] wrote a paper on an unrelated\ntopic that utilized the work of van Kampen and of Kurtz. In that work the\nconnection between D and S is SST = D. ST is the adjoint (transpose) of S. D\nremains a positive definite symmetric matrix but S need not be. Fox has\nreproduced the 2012 results of Orio and Soudry for potassium channels and has\nalso found in closed form the solution for the more complicated sodium\nchannels.

The marginal smoothing\ntechnique is the most effective for user verification in terms of equal error\nrate (EER) and with a sampling rate of 1/30s^{-1} and 30 minutes of historical\ndata, and the method is capable of detecting an intrusion within ~2.5 minutes\nof application use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 03:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

These techniques are heavily used for\nimproving security and usability in Zero-Interaction based Co-presence\nDetection and Authentication (ZICDA) systems. In particular, the survey\nincludes a discussion on the possible adversary and communication models along\nwith the existing security attacks on ZICDA systems, and it reviews the\nstate-of-the-art proximity detection techniques that make use of contextual\ninformation. These proximity detection techniques are commonly referred to as\nContextual Co-presence (COCO) protocols, which dynamically collect and use\ncontextual information to improve the security of ZICDA systems during the\nproximity verification process. Finally, we summarize the significant\nchallenges and suggest possible innovative and efficient future solutions for\nsecurely detecting co-presence between devices in the presence of adversaries.\nThe proximity verification techniques presented in the literature usually\ninvolve trade-offs between metrics such as efficiency, security, deployment\ncost, and usability. At present, there is no ideal solution which adequately\naddresses the trade-off between these metrics. Therefore, we trust that this\nreview gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known\nresearch methodologies and pave the way for the design of future practical,\nsecure, and efficient solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 14:37:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 13:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-15"}

One possibility to achieve both generality and efficiency is to\nspecialize this procedure w.r.t. any given narrow task. However, complete\nspecialization that implies direct mapping from the task parameters to\nsolutions (discriminative models) without search is not always possible. In\nthis paper, partial specialization of general search is considered in the form\nof genetic algorithms (GAs) with a specialized crossover operator. We perform a\nfeasibility study of this idea implementing such an operator in the form of a\ndeep feedforward neural network. GAs with trainable crossover operators are\ncompared with the result of complete specialization, which is also represented\nas a deep neural network.
