The program synthesis algorithm rests on the novel framework of Synthetic\nSeparation Logic (SSL), which generalises the classical notion of heap\nentailment $\\mathcal{P} \\vdash \\mathcal{Q}$ to incorporate a possibility of\ntransforming a heap satisfying an assertion $\\mathcal{P}$ into a heap\nsatisfying an assertion $\\mathcal{Q}$.

To address these tasks, a\nskeletonbased representation, namely, SPMF (Skeleton Pose-Motion Feature) is\nproposed.

Our main goal is to study the optimal policies,\nwhich can be obtained by solving the dynamic programming formulated for the\nproblem, both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is well-known that when the\ndemand size is fixed and the demand distribution is stationary over time, the\nvalue function of the dynamic programming exhibits extremely useful first and\nsecond order monotonicity properties, which lead to monotonicity properties of\nthe optimal policies. In this paper, we are able to verify that these results\nstill hold even in the case that the price distributions are time-dependent.\nWhen we further relax the demand size distribution assumptions and allow them\nto be arbitrary, for example in random batches, we develop a scheme for using\nvalue function of alternative unit demand systems to provide bounds to the\nvalue function. These results confirm some of the basic understandings of the\nstochastic knapsack problem. As a natural consequence, we propose a new class\nof heuristic policies, two-dimensional switch-over policies, and discuss\nnumerical procedures for optimizing the parameters of the policies. Extensive\nnumerical experiments demonstrate that these switch-over policies can provide\nperformances that are in a close neighborhood of the optimum statistically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 16:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-19"}

In such light, we present the\nfirst systematic effort in collecting a large dataset for robotic grasping in\nhomes. First, to scale and parallelize data collection, we built a low cost\nmobile manipulator assembled for under 3K USD. Second, data collected using low\ncost robots suffer from noisy labels due to imperfect execution and calibration\nerrors. To handle this, we develop a framework which factors out the noise as a\nlatent variable. Our model is trained on 28K grasps collected in several houses\nunder an array of different environmental conditions. We evaluate our models by\nphysically executing grasps on a collection of novel objects in multiple unseen\nhomes. The models trained with our home dataset showed a marked improvement of\n43.7% over a baseline model trained with data collected in lab. Our\narchitecture which explicitly models the latent noise in the dataset also\nperformed 10% better than one that did not factor out the noise.

When we run pairs of 'shadow' simulations that are\nidentical except for random minute initial displacements to particle positions\n(e.g. of order 1e-7pc), the results diverge from each other at the individual\ngalaxy level (while the statistical properties of the ensemble of galaxies are\nunchanged). After cosmological times, the global properties of pairs of\n'shadow' galaxies that are matched between the simulations differ from each\nother generally at a level of ~2-25%, depending on the considered physical\nquantity. We perform these experiments using cosmological volumes of\n(25-50Mpc/h)^3 evolved either purely with dark matter, or with baryons and\nstar-formation but no feedback, or using the full feedback model of the\nIllustrisTNG project. The runs cover four resolution levels spanning a factor\nof 512 in mass. We find that without feedback the differences between shadow\ngalaxies generally become smaller as the resolution increases, but with the\nIllustrisTNG model the results are mostly converging towards a 'floor'. This\nhints at the role of feedback in setting the chaotic properties of galaxy\nformation.

However, due to rate adaptation in adaptive\nstreaming, the quality of the videos at the client keeps varying with time\ndepending on the end-to-end network conditions. Further, varying network\nconditions can lead to the video client running out of playback content\nresulting in rebuffering events. These factors affect the user satisfaction and\ncause degradation of the user quality of experience (QoE). It is important to\nquantify the perceptual QoE of the streaming video users and monitor the same\nin a continuous manner so that the QoE degradation can be minimized. However,\nthe continuous evaluation of QoE is challenging as it is determined by complex\ndynamic interactions among the QoE influencing factors. Towards this end, we\npresent LSTM-QoE, a recurrent neural network based QoE prediction model using a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The LSTM-QoE is a network of cascaded\nLSTM blocks to capture the nonlinearities and the complex temporal dependencies\ninvolved in the time varying QoE. Based on an evaluation over several publicly\navailable continuous QoE databases, we demonstrate that the LSTM-QoE has the\ncapability to model the QoE dynamics effectively. We compare the proposed model\nwith the state-of-the-art QoE prediction models and show that it provides\nsuperior performance across these databases. Further, we discuss the state\nspace perspective for the LSTM-QoE and show the efficacy of the state space\nmodeling approaches for QoE prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 20:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-20"}

The minimum weight $k$-cut can be\ncomputed in $O(n^{O(k)})$ time, but when $k$ is treated as part of the input,\ncomputing the minimum weight $k$-cut is NP-Hard [Holdschmidt and Hochbaum\n1994]. For $\\operatorname{poly}(m,n,k)$-time algorithms, the best possible\napproximation factor is essentially 2 under the small set expansion hypothesis\n[Manurangsi 2017]. Saran and Vazirani [1995] showed that a $(2 -\n2/k)$-approximately minimum weight $k$-cut can be computed by $O(k)$ minimum\ncuts, which implies an $\\tilde{O}(mk)$ randomized running time via the nearly\nlinear time randomized min-cut algorithm of Karger [2000].

While many advancements have\nbeen made, there is room for continued improvements. One hurdle is that CT\nimages can exhibit high noise and low contrast, particularly in lower dosages.\nTo address this, we focus on a preprocessing method for CT images that uses\nstacked generative adversarial networks (SGAN) approach. The first GAN reduces\nthe noise in the CT image and the second GAN generates a higher resolution\nimage with enhanced boundaries and high contrast. To make up for the absence of\nhigh quality CT images, we detail how to synthesize a large number of low- and\nhigh-quality natural images and use transfer learning with progressively larger\namounts of CT images. We apply both the classic GrabCut method and the modern\nholistically nested network (HNN) to lesion segmentation, testing whether SGAN\ncan yield improved lesion segmentation. Experimental results on the DeepLesion\ndataset demonstrate that the SGAN enhancements alone can push GrabCut\nperformance over HNN trained on original images.

Due to\ntheir complexity, we currently lack ready-to-use, analytic waveforms in the\nFourier domain valid for sufficiently high eccentricity, and such models are\ncrucial to coherently extract weak signals from the noise. We here take the\nfirst steps to derive and properly validate an analytic waveform model in the\nFourier domain that is valid for inspirals of arbitrary orbital eccentricity.\nAs a proof-of-concept, we build this model to leading post-Newtonian order by\ncombining the stationary phase approximation, a truncated sum of harmonics, and\nan analytic representation of hypergeometric functions. Through comparisons\nwith numerical post-Newtonian waveforms, we determine how many harmonics are\nrequired for a faithful (matches above 99%) representation of the signal up to\norbital eccentricities as large as 0.9. As a first byproduct of this analysis,\nwe present a novel technique to maximize the match of eccentric signals over\ntime of coalescence and phase at coalescence. As a second byproduct, we\ndetermine which of the different approximations we employ leads to the largest\nloss in match, which could be used to systematically improve the model because\nof our analytic control. The future extension of this model to higher\npost-Newtonian order will allow for an accurate and fast phenomenological\nhybrid that can account for arbitrary eccentricity inspirals and mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 21:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Direct evidence for the radiation dominated epoch extends back until\nnucleosynthesis, which began during the first second. However there are\ntheoretical reasons to prefer a period of earlier matter domination, prior to\nnucleosynthesis, e.g. due to late decaying massive particles needed to explain\nbaryogenesis. Axion cosmology is quantitatively affected by an early period of\nmatter domination, with a different axion mass range preferred and greater\ninhomogeneity produced on small scales. In this work we show that such\nincreased inhomogeneity can lead to the formation of axion miniclusters in\naxion parameter ranges that are different from those usually assumed. If the\nreheating temperature is below $58$ MeV, axion miniclusters can form even if\nthe axion field is present during inflation and has been previously\nhomogenized.

We expect that\nthis public catalog can be used as a reference sample to investigate the\neffects of the tidal interaction on the evolution of star-formation,\nmorphology/structure of dwarf galaxies.\n  Our sample is overwhelmingly dominated by star-forming galaxies, and they are\ngenerally found significantly below the red-sequence in the color-magnitude\nrelation. The number of early-type galaxies is only 3 out of 177. We classify\nthem, according to observed low surface brightness features, into various\ncategories including shells, stellar streams, loops, antennae or simply\ninteracting. We find that dwarf-dwarf interactions tend to prefer the low\ndensity environment. Only 41 out of the 177 candidate dwarf-dwarf interaction\nsystems have giant neighbors within a sky projected distance of 700 kpc and a\nline of sight radial velocity range $\\pm$700 km/s and, compared to the LMC-SMC,\nthey are generally located at much larger sky-projected distances from their\nnearest giant neighbor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 00:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Radio\ndesigns based on hybrid digital and analog array architectures and the usage of\nradio frequency (RF) signal processing via phase shifters have emerged as\npotential solutions to improve energy efficiency and deliver performances close\nto digital arrays. In this paper, we provide an overview of the\nstate-of-the-art mmW massive antenna array designs and comparison among three\narchitectures, namely digital array, sub-array, and fully-connected hybrid\narray. The comparison of performance, power, and area for these three\narchitectures is performed for three representative 5G use cases, which cover a\nrange of pre-beamforming SNR and multiplexing regimes.

However, in practice\nand especially for the important case of mixture models, one frequently needs\nto contend with the difficulties of non-existence or non-uniqueness of\nstatistically meaningful solutions, as well as the high computational cost of\nsolving large polynomial systems. Moreover, theoretical analysis of the method\nof moments are mainly confined to asymptotic normality style of results\nestablished under strong assumptions.\n  This paper considers estimating a $k$-component Gaussian location mixture\nwith a common (possibly unknown) variance parameter. To overcome the\naforementioned theoretic and algorithmic hurdles, a crucial step is to denoise\nthe moment estimates by projecting to the truncated moment space (via\nsemidefinite programming) before solving the method of moments equations. Not\nonly does this regularization ensures existence and uniqueness of solutions, it\nalso yields fast solvers by means of Gauss quadrature.

In dielectric theories, screening\nis assigned to the surface charge appearing from preferential orientations of\ndipoles along the local field in the interface.

We argue\nthat dielectric properties of polar liquids should be characterized by two\ndistinct susceptibilities responsible for local response (solvation) and\nlong-range response (dielectric screening). We develop a microscopic model of\nscreening showing that the standard bulk dielectric constant is responsible for\nscreening at large distances.

Existing methods either\nattempt to align the cross-domain distributions, or perform manifold subspace\nlearning.

On the other hand, subspace learning is not sufficient to reduce the\ndistribution divergence. (2) unevaluated distribution alignment, which means\nthat existing distribution alignment methods only align the marginal and\nconditional distributions with equal importance, while they fail to evaluate\nthe different importance of these two distributions in real applications.

To\nexclude the latter option, we propose an improvement in the experimental scheme\nby adding a graphene sheet on top of an ITO film. The formalism is developed\nallowing precise calculation of the Casimir force between an Au sphere and a\ngraphene sheet on top of ITO film deposited on a quartz substrate. In doing so\nAu, ITO, and quartz are described by the frequency-dependent dielectric\npermittivities and real graphene sheet with nonzero mass-gap parameter and\nchemical potential by the polarization tensor at nonzero temperature.

This work\nproposes a novel type of objective function for graph clustering, in the form\nof a multilinear polynomial whose coefficients are determined by network\ntopology. It may be thought of as a potential function, to be maximized, taking\nits values on fuzzy clusterings or families of fuzzy subsets of nodes over\nwhich every node distributes a unit membership. When suitably parametrized,\nthis potential is shown to attain its maximum when every node concentrates its\nall unit membership on some module. The output thus is a partition, while the\noriginal discrete optimization problem is turned into a continuous version\nallowing to conceive alternative search strategies. The instance of the problem\nbeing a pseudo-Boolean function assigning real-valued cluster scores to node\nsubsets, modularity maximization is employed to exemplify a so-called quadratic\nform, in that the scores of singletons and pairs also fully determine the\nscores of larger clusters, while the resulting multilinear polynomial potential\nfunction has degree 2.

Therefore, target identifications by operator in a subset\nof cameras cannot be utilized to improve ranking of the target in remaining set\nof network cameras. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel sequential\nmulti-camera re-id approach.

To characterize an absorber, one needs to deal with the\ncoupling that may occur between different excitations. Energy Absorption\nInterferometry (EAI) is a technique that highlights the independent degrees of\nfreedom through which a structure can absorb energy: the natural absorption\nmodes of the structure. The coupling between these modes vanishes. In this\npaper, we use the EAI formalism to analyse different kinds of plasmonic\nperiodic absorbers while rigorously accounting for the coupling: resonant\ngolden patches on a grounded dielectric slab, parallel free-standing silver\nwires and a silver slab of finite thickness. The EAI formalism is used to\nidentify the physical processes that mediate absorption in the near and far\nfield. First, we demonstrate that the angular absorption, which is classically\nused to characterize periodic absorbers in the far field and which neglects the\ncoupling between different plane waves, is only valid under stringent\nconditions (subwavelength periodicity, far field excitation and negligible\ncoupling between the two possible polarizations). Using EAI, we show how the\ndominant absorption channels can be identified through the signature of the\nabsorption modes of the structure, while rigorously accounting for the\ncoupling. We then exploit these channels to improve absorption. We show that\nlong-range processes can be exploited to enhance the spatial selectivity, while\nshort-range processes can be exploited to improve absorptivity over wide angles\nof incidence. Lastly, we show that simply adding scatterers with the proper\nperiodicity on top of the absorber, the absorption can be increased by more\nthan one order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 09:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 11:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

Moreover, the minimum cuts in $T$\ndirectly identify (in a certain way) those in $G$. It is well-known that we may\nnot always find a GH tree which is a subgraph of $G$. For instance, every GH\ntree for the vertices of $K_{3,3}$ is a $5$-star. We characterize those graph\nand terminal pairs $(G,Z)$ which always admit such a tree.

Aims: We analyze the light curve of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in\nS255IR-NIRS3 during the 2015-2016 burst. Methods: 8.5-year monitoring data with\nan average sampling interval of 5 days were obtained with the Torun 32 m radio\ntelescope.

The main burst was\npreceded by a one-year increase of the total flux density by a factor of 2.5,\nthen it grew by a factor of 10 over ~0.4 years and declined by a factor of 8\nduring the consecutive 2.4 years. The peak maser luminosity was a factor of\n24.5 higher than the pre-burst quiescent value.

In any investigation concerning the perfect\nmatching polytope, one may assume that $G$ is matching covered --- that is, it\nis a connected graph (of order at least two) and each edge lies in some perfect\nmatching.\n  A graph $G$ is Birkhoff-von Neumann (BvN) if its perfect matching polytope is\ncharacterized solely by non-negativity and degree constraints. A result of\nBalas (1981) implies that $G$ is BvN if and only if $G$ does not contain a pair\nof vertex-disjoint odd cycles $(C_1,C_2)$ such that $G-V(C_1)-V(C_2)$ has a\nperfect matching. It follows immediately that the corresponding decision\nproblem is in co-NP. However, it is not known to be in NP. The problem is in P\nif the input graph is planar --- due to a result of Carvalho, Lucchesi and\nMurty (2004). These authors, along with Kothari (2018), have shown that this\nproblem is equivalent to the seemingly unrelated problem of deciding whether a\ngiven graph is $\\overline{C_6}$-free.\n  The combinatorial diameter of a polytope is the diameter of its $1$-skeleton\ngraph. A graph $G$ is PM-compact (PMc) if the combinatorial diameter of its\nperfect matching polytope equals one. A result of Chv\\'atal (1975) implies that\n$G$ is PMc if and only if $G$ does not contain a pair of vertex-disjoint even\ncycles $(C_1,C_2)$ such that $G-V(C_1)-V(C_2)$ has a perfect matching.

The\nbehavior of dense suspensions of phoretic particles and of bacteria during\nbiofilm formation is determined by two principle physical mechanisms: (i)\nvolume exclusion (short-range steric repulsion) and (ii) quorum sensing\n(longer-range reduced propulsion due to alteration of the local chemical\nenvironment). To systematically characterize such systems, we study\nsemi-penetrable self-propelled rods in two dimensions, with a propulsion force\nthat decreases with increasing local rod density, by employing Brownian\nDynamics simulations. Volume exclusion and quorum sensing both lead to phase\nseparation, however, the structure and rod dynamics vastly differ. Quorum\nsensing enhances the polarity of the clusters, induces perpendicularity of rods\nat the cluster borders, and enhances cluster formation. For systems, where the\nrods essentially become passive at high densities, formation of asters and\nstripes is observed. Systems of rods with larger aspect ratios show more\nordered structures compared to those with smaller aspect ratios, due to their\nstronger alignment, with almost circular asters for strongly density-dependent\npropulsion force. With increasing range of the quorum-sensing interaction, the\nlocal density decreases, asters become less stable, and polar hedgehog clusters\nand clusters with domains appear. Our results characterize structure formation\nand dynamics due to the competition of two qualitatively different interaction\nmechanisms, steric hindrance and quorum sensing, which are both relevant for\nengineered phoretic microswimmers as well as for bacteria in biofilm formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

It is a faint VHE $\\gamma$-ray emitter, though\nits VHE flux exceeds both the extrapolation from early Fermi-LAT observations\nas well as expectations from a (misaligned) single-zone synchrotron-self\nCompton (SSC) description. The latter satisfactorily reproduces the emission\nfrom Cen A at lower energies up to a few GeV. New observations with H.E.S.S.,\ncomparable in exposure time to those previously reported, were performed and\neight years of Fermi-LAT data were accumulated to clarify the spectral\ncharacteristics of the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the core of Cen A. The\nresults allow us for the first time to achieve the goal of constructing a\nrepresentative, contemporaneous $\\gamma$-ray core spectrum of Cen A over almost\nfive orders of magnitude in energy. Advanced analysis methods, including the\ntemplate fitting method, allow detection in the VHE range of the core with a\nstatistical significance of 12$\\sigma$ on the basis of 213 hours of total\nexposure time.

The fact that the spectrum\nhardens at GeV energies and extends into the VHE regime disfavour a single-zone\nSSC interpretation for the overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of the\ncore and is suggestive of a new $\\gamma$-ray emitting component connecting the\nhigh-energy emission above the break energy to the one observed at VHE\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The\nproposed formulation fits within the framework of the finite cell method, where\nessential boundary conditions are imposed weakly using a Nitsche-type method.\nThe key idea of the proposed formulation is to stabilize the jumps of\nhigh-order derivatives of variables over the skeleton of the background mesh.\nThe formulation allows the use of identical finite-dimensional spaces for the\napproximation of the pressure and velocity fields in immersed domains. The\nstability issues observed for inf-sup stable discretizations of immersed\nincompressible flow problems are avoided with this formulation. For B-spline\nbasis functions of degree $k$ with highest regularity, only the derivative of\norder $k$ has to be controlled, which requires specification of only a single\nstabilization parameter for the pressure field. The Stokes and Navier-Stokes\nequations are studied numerically in two and three dimensions using various\nimmersed test cases. Oscillation-free solutions and high-order optimal\nconvergence rates can be obtained. The formulation is shown to be stable even\nin limit cases where almost every elements of the physical domain is cut, and\nhence it does not require the existence of interior cells. In terms of the\nsparsity pattern, the algebraic system has a considerably smaller stencil than\ncounterpart approaches based on Lagrange basis functions. This important\nproperty makes the proposed skeleton-stabilized technique computationally\npractical.

Malicious or incorrect\ninformation can cause a loss of money, reputation, and resources; and in\ncertain situations, pose a threat to human life. In this paper, we use an\nensembled semi-supervised approach to determine the credibility of Reddit posts\nby estimating their reputation score to ensure the validity of information\ningested by AI systems. We demonstrate our approach in the cybersecurity\ndomain, where security analysts utilize these systems to determine possible\nthreats by analyzing the data scattered on social media websites, forums,\nblogs, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 13:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-20"}

The current best\nmeasurements of the $W$ boson mass come from single production measurements at\nhadron colliders in its decay mode to a lepton (electron or muon) and a\nneutrino and pair production of $W$ bosons at lepton colliders, where also the\ndecay mode of the $W$ boson to hadrons has been considered. In this study,\nprospects for a measurement of the $W$ boson mass in the all-jet final state at\nhadron colliders are presented. The feasibility of this measurement takes\nadvantage of numerous recent developments in the field of jet substructure.\nCompared to other methods for measuring the $W$ mass, a measurement in the\nall-jets final state would be complementary in methodology and have systematic\nuncertainties orthogonal to previous measurements. We have estimated the main\nexperimental and theoretical uncertainties affecting a measurement in the\nall-jet final state. With new trigger strategies, a statistical uncertainty for\nthe measurement of the mass difference between the $Z$ and $W$ bosons of 30 MeV\ncould be reached with HL-LHC data corresponding to 3000 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated\nluminosity.

A clinically validated AI\nsystem that can reliably separate normals from abnormals can be invaluble\nparticularly in low-resource settings. The aim of this study was to develop and\nvalidate a deep learning system to detect various abnormalities seen on a chest\nX-ray. Methods: A deep learning system was trained on 2.3 million chest X-rays\nand their corresponding radiology reports to identify various abnormalities\nseen on a Chest X-ray. The system was tested against - 1. A three-radiologist\nmajority on an independent, retrospectively collected set of 2000\nX-rays(CQ2000) 2. Radiologist reports on a separate validation set of 100,000\nscans(CQ100k). The primary accuracy measure was area under the ROC curve (AUC),\nestimated separately for each abnormality and for normal versus abnormal scans.\nResults: On the CQ2000 dataset, the deep learning system demonstrated an AUC of\n0.92(CI 0.91-0.94) for detection of abnormal scans, and AUC(CI) of\n0.96(0.94-0.98), 0.96(0.94-0.98), 0.95(0.87-1), 0.95(0.92-0.98),\n0.93(0.90-0.96), 0.89(0.83-0.94), 0.91(0.87-0.96), 0.94(0.93-0.96),\n0.98(0.97-1) for the detection of blunted costophrenic angle, cardiomegaly,\ncavity, consolidation, fibrosis, hilar enlargement, nodule, opacity and pleural\neffusion. The AUCs were similar on the larger CQ100k dataset except for\ndetecting normals where the AUC was 0.86(0.85-0.86).

A gambler that knows the distributions must decide at each point\nin time whether to stop and pick the current sample or to continue and lose\nthat sample forever. The goal of the gambler is to maximize the expected value\nof what she picks and the performance measure is the worst case ratio between\nthe expected value the gambler gets and what a prophet, that sees all the\nrealizations in advance, gets. In the late seventies, Krengel and Sucheston,\nand Gairing (1977) established that this worst case ratio is a universal\nconstant equal to 1/2. In the last decade prophet inequalities has resurged as\nan important problem due to its connections to posted price mechanisms,\nfrequently used in online sales. A very interesting variant is the Prophet\nSecretary problem, in which the only difference is that the samples arrive in a\nuniformly random order. For this variant several algorithms achieve a constant\nof 1-1/e and very recently this barrier was slightly improved. This paper\nanalyzes strategies that set a nonincreasing sequence of thresholds to be\napplied at different times. The gambler stops the first time a sample surpasses\nthe corresponding threshold. Specifically we consider a class of strategies\ncalled blind quantile strategies. They consist in fixing a function which is\nused to define a sequence of thresholds once the instance is revealed. Our main\nresult shows that they can achieve a constant of 0.665, improving upon the best\nknown result of Azar et al. (2018), and on Beyhaghi et al. (2018) (order\nselection). Our proof analyzes precisely the underlying stopping time\ndistribution, relying on Schur-convexity theory. We further prove that blind\nstrategies cannot achieve better than 0.675. Finally we prove that no algorithm\nfor the gambler can achieve better than 0.732.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 15:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 15:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

At the same time, the optical\ntransmitting modes inside MMFs are highly sensitive to external perturbations\nand environmental changes, resulting in MMF transmission channels being highly\nvariable and random. This largely limits the practical application of MMFs and\nhinders the full exploitation of their information capacity. Despite great\nresearch efforts made to overcome the high variability and randomness inside\nMMFs, any geometric change to the MMF leads to completely different\ntransmission matrices, which unavoidably fails at the information recovery.\nHere, we show the successful binary image transmission using deep learning\nthrough a single MMF, which is stationary or subject to dynamic shape\nvariations. We found that a single convolutional neural network has excellent\ngeneralisation capability with various MMF transmission states. This deep\nneural network can be trained by multiple MMF transmission states to accurately\npredict unknown information at the other end of the MMF at any of these states,\nwithout knowing which state is present. Our results demonstrate that deep\nlearning is a promising solution to address the variability and randomness\nchallenge of MMF based information channels. This deep-learning approach is the\nstarting point of developing future high-capacity MMF optical systems and\ndevices, and is applicable to optical systems concerning other diffusing media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 21:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-27"}

However, US\nimages have limited capture range, and suffer from view dependent artefacts\nsuch as acoustic shadows. Compounding of overlapping 3D US acquisitions into a\nhigh-resolution volume can extend the field of view and remove image artefacts,\nwhich is useful for retrospective analysis including population based studies.\nHowever, such volume reconstructions require information about relative\ntransformations between probe positions from which the individual volumes were\nacquired. In prenatal US scans, the fetus can move independently from the\nmother, making external trackers such as electromagnetic or optical tracking\nunable to track the motion between probe position and the moving fetus. We\nprovide a novel methodology for image-based tracking and volume reconstruction\nby combining recent advances in deep learning and simultaneous localisation and\nmapping (SLAM). Tracking semantics are established through the use of a\nResidual 3D U-Net and the output is fed to the SLAM algorithm. As a proof of\nconcept, experiments are conducted on US volumes taken from a whole body fetal\nphantom, and from the heads of real fetuses. For the fetal head segmentation,\nwe also introduce a novel weak annotation approach to minimise the required\nmanual effort for ground truth annotation. We evaluate our method\nqualitatively, and quantitatively with respect to tissue discrimination\naccuracy and tracking robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

Moreover, the smoothness\nmeasurement of TENO schemes is in fact acting as shock-detectors, which are\ncapable for distinguishing discontinuities and smooth critical points.\nFollowing the idea of a recent improvement, i.e. TENO-NA, the shock-detection\nand stencil-selection are completely separated in this work. Higher-order\npolynomials using neighbouring points of the standard five-point TENO scheme\nare applied for achieving higher-order accuracy without significantly\nincreasing computation cost, by exploring the neighbouring smoothness\nmeasurements. In this work, seventh-order spatial accuracy is achieved, and the\ncomputational complexity is similar to that of the five-point TENO scheme.\nEspecially, the presented method introduces new flexibility in constructing\nhigh-order numerical methods.

Instead, mixture-averaged diffusion treatments are\ntypically used to avoid these costs. However, to our knowledge, the accuracy\nand appropriateness of the mixture-averaged diffusion models has not been\nverified for three-dimensional turbulent premixed flames. In this study we\npropose a fast,efficient, low-memory algorithm and use that to evaluate the\nrole of multicomponent mass diffusion in reacting-flow simulations. Direct\nnumerical simulation of these flames is performed by implementing the\nStefan-Maxwell equations in NGA. A semi-implicit algorithm decreases the\ncomputational expense of inverting the full multicomponent ordinary diffusion\narray while maintaining accuracy and fidelity. We first verify the method by\nperforming one-dimensional simulations of premixed hydrogen flames and compare\nwith matching cases in Cantera. We demonstrate the algorithm to be stable, and\nits performance scales approximately with the number of species squared. Then,\nas an initial study of multicomponent diffusion, we simulate premixed,\nthree-dimensional turbulent hydrogen flames, neglecting secondary Soret and\nDufour effects. Simulation conditions are carefully selected to match\npreviously published results and ensure valid comparison. Our results show that\nusing the mixture-averaged diffusion assumption leads to a 15% under-prediction\nof the normalized turbulent flame speed for a premixed hydrogen-air flame. This\ndifference in the turbulent flame speed motivates further study into using the\nmixture-averaged diffusion assumption for DNS of moderate-to-high Karlovitz\nnumber flames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 00:07:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 17:03:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 18:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}
