Compressing the 3D models used for\nlocalization thus becomes a practical necessity.

The anti-malware\ndevelopers and threat experts, on the other hand, do not have such a privilege\nof tuning anti-malware products against zero-day attacks pro-actively. This\nallows the malware authors to being a step ahead of the anti-malware products,\nfundamentally biasing the cat and mouse game played by the two parties. In this\npaper, we propose a way that would enable machine learning based threat\nprevention models to bridge that gap by being able to tune against a deep\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN), which takes up the role of a malware\nauthor and generates new types of malware. The GAN is trained over a reversible\ndistributed RGB image representation of known malware behaviors, encoding the\nsequence of API call ngrams and the corresponding term frequencies. The\ngenerated images represent synthetic malware that can be decoded back to the\nunderlying API call sequence information. The image representation is not only\ndemonstrated as a general technique of incorporating necessary priors for\nexploiting convolutional neural network architectures for generative or\ndiscriminative modeling, but also as a visualization method for easy manual\nsoftware or malware categorization, by having individual API ngram information\ndistributed across the image space. In addition, we also propose using\nsmart-definitions for detecting malwares based on perceptual hashing of these\nimages. Such hashes are potentially more effective than cryptographic hashes\nthat do not carry any meaningful similarity metric, and hence, do not\ngeneralize well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 16:35:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 16:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

However, the physical principles behind gliding motility\nstill remain poorly understood. Using myxobacteria as a canonical example of\nsuch organisms, we identify here the physical principles behind gliding\nmotility, and develop a theoretical model that predicts a two-regime behavior\nof the gliding speed as a function of the substrate stiffness. Our theory\ndescribes the elastic, viscous, and capillary interactions between the\nbacterial membrane carrying a traveling wave, the secreted slime acting as a\nlubricating film, and the substrate which we model as a soft solid. Defining\nthe myxobacterial gliding as the horizontal motion on the substrate under zero\nnet force, we find the two-regime behavior is due to two different mechanisms\nof motility thrust. On stiff substrates, the thrust arises from the bacterial\nshape deformations creating a flow of slime that exerts a pressure along the\nbacterial length. This pressure in conjunction with the bacterial shape\nprovides the necessary thrust for propulsion. However, we show that such a\nmechanism cannot lead to gliding on very soft substrates. Instead, we show that\ncapillary effects lead to the formation of a ridge at the slime-substrate-air\ninterface, which creates a thrust in the form of a localized pressure gradient\nat the tip of the bacteria. To test our theory, we perform experiments with\nisolated cells on agar substrates of varying stiffness and find the measured\ngliding speeds to be in good agreement with the predictions from our\nelasto-capillary-hydrodynamic model. The physical mechanisms reported here\nserve as an important step towards an accurate theory of friction and\nsubstrate-mediated interaction between bacteria in a swarm of cells\nproliferating in soft media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 16:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 16:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

We evaluate our experiments on MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST and medical (histological and retina images) publicly available\ndatasets. Our results suggest that capsule networks can be trained with less\namount of data for the same or better performance and are more robust to an\nimbalanced class distribution, which makes our approach very promising for the\nmedical imaging community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 17:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Implicit\ndescriptions shed light on problems such as parameter identification, model\nequivalence, and constraint-based statistical inference. For models given by\ndirected acyclic graphs, which represent settings where all relevant variables\nare observed, there is a complete theory: All conditional independence\nrelations can be found via graphical $d$-separation and are sufficient for an\nimplicit description. The situation is far more complicated, however, when some\nof the variables are hidden (or in other words, unobserved or latent). We\nconsider models associated to mixed graphs that capture the effects of hidden\nvariables through correlated error terms. The notion of trek separation\nexplains when the covariance matrix in such a model has submatrices of low rank\nand generalizes $d$-separation. However, in many cases, such as the infamous\nVerma graph, the polynomials defining the graphical model are not\ndeterminantal, and hence cannot be explained by $d$-separation or\ntrek-separation. In this paper, we show that these constraints often correspond\nto the vanishing of nested determinants and can be graphically explained by a\nnotion of restricted trek separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 17:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-20"}

For this reason, Gilbert and Jain [11] and Fan, et al. [8] introduce\nthe closely related problems of $\\textit{sparse metric repair}$ and\n$\\textit{metric violation distance}$. The goal of each problem is to repair as\nfew distances as possible to ensure that the distances between the data points\nsatisfy a metric.

The analytic tools are multivariate meromorphic\ngerms of pseudodifferential symbols with linear poles which generalise the\nmeromorphic germs of functions with linear poles studied in previous work.\nMultivariate meromorphic germs of pseudodifferential symbols form a locality\nalgebra on which we build various locality maps in the framework of locality\nstructures. We first show that the finite part at infinity defines a locality\ncharacter from the latter symbol valued meromorphic germs to the scalar valued\nones. We further equip the locality algebra of germs of pseudodifferential\nsymbols with locality Rota-Baxter operators given by regularised sums and\nintegrals. By means of the universal properties in the framework of locality\nstructures we can lift Rota-Baxter operators to trees, and use the lifted\ndiscrete sums in order to build and study renormalised branched zeta values\nassociated with trees. By construction these renormalised branched zeta values\nfactorise on mutually independent (for the locality relation) trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 13:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

The\npresent work focuses on the three-boson system in the presence of 1D spin-orbit\ncoupling, which is most relevant to ongoing cold atom experiments. In the\nabsence of spin-orbit coupling terms, the three-boson system exibits the Efimov\neffect: the entire energy spectrum is uniquely determined by the $s$-wave\nscattering length and a single three-body parameter, i.e., using one of the\nenergy levels as input, the other energy levels can be obtained via Efimov's\nradial scaling law, which is intimately tied to a discrete scaling symmetry. It\nis demonstrated that the discrete scaling symmetry persists in the presence of\n1D spin-orbit coupling, implying the validity of a generalized radial scaling\nlaw in five-dimensional space. The dependence of the energy levels on the\nscattering length, spin-orbit coupling parameters, and center-of-mass momentum\nis discussed.

Such methods typically entail\nsweeps of microwave radiation over the broad electron linewidth to excite DNP,\nbut are often inefficient because the sweeps, constrained by adiabaticity\nrequirements, are slow. In this paper we develop a technique to overcome the\nDNP bottlenecks set by the slow sweeps, employing a swept microwave frequency\ncomb that increases the effective number of polarization transfer events while\nrespecting adiabaticity constraints. This allows a multiplicative gain in DNP\nenhancement, scaling with the number of comb frequencies and limited only by\nthe hyperfine-mediated electron linewidth.

In this formalism, I prove\nthat a conscious observer is necessarily a physical object that can memorize\nlocal events by setting one of its parts in an exactly specified constant\nquantum state (hypotheses H1, H2 and H3). Then I define the probability of a\nfuture event as the proportion of initial observers, all identical, who will\nactually experience that event. It then becomes possible to establish the usual\nresults of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, I detail the link between\nprobabilities and relative frequencies. Additionally, I study the biological\nfeasibility of this modelling of observer's mind.\n  The second part of this paper completes the neuronal description of the mind\nfunctions, based on current neuroscientific knowledge. It provides a model that\nis compatible with the assumptions of the first part and consistent with our\ndaily conscious experience. In particular, it develops a model of\nself-consciousness based on an explicit use of the random component of neuron\nbehaviour; according to the first part, that random is in fact the coexistence\nof a multiplicity of possibilities. So, when the mind measures the random part\nof certain neurons in the brain, he goes himself within each of these\npossibilities. The mind has a decision-making component that is active in this\nsituation, appearing then as the cause of the choice of this possibility among\nall the others. This models the self-consciousness which then ensures the unity\nof our conscious experience by equating this experience with ``what the ego is\nconscious about''. The conclusion details the points that remain to be\ndeveloped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 00:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

When lines are compressible, the hardware can store\nmultiple lines in a single memory location, and retrieve all these lines in a\nsingle access, thereby increasing the effective memory bandwidth. However,\nrelocating and packing multiple lines together depending on the compressibility\ncauses a line to have multiple possible locations. Therefore, memory\ncompression designs typically require metadata to specify the compressibility\nof the line. Unfortunately, even in the presence of dedicated metadata caches,\nmaintaining and accessing this metadata incurs significant bandwidth overheads\nand can degrade performance by as much as 40%. Ideally, we want to implement\nmemory compression while eliminating the bandwidth overheads of metadata\naccesses.\n  This paper proposes CRAM, a bandwidth-efficient design for memory compression\nthat is entirely hardware based and does not require any OS support or changes\nto the memory modules or interfaces. CRAM uses a novel implicit-metadata\nmechanism, whereby the compressibility of the line can be determined by\nscanning the line for a special marker word, eliminating the overheads of\nmetadata access. CRAM is equipped with a low-cost Line Location Predictor (LLP)\nthat can determine the location of the line with 98% accuracy. Furthermore, we\nalso develop a scheme that can dynamically enable or disable compression based\non the bandwidth cost of storing compressed lines and the bandwidth benefits of\nobtaining compressed lines, ensuring no degradation for workloads that do not\nbenefit from compression. Our evaluations, over a diverse set of 27 workloads,\nshow that CRAM provides a speedup of up to 73% (average 6%) without causing\nslowdown for any of the workloads, and consuming a storage overhead of less\nthan 300 bytes at the memory controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 01:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES\nand brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and\nintrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based\nsample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n=1012) to\nexamine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated\nfrom resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We\nquantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network\nsegregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for\na greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation\ncaptured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age,\nhigh-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and\nthis effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and\nventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in\nclustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length,\nconsistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in\nlow-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of\nregional homogeneity. Our findings suggest that neighborhood SES may\nfundamentally alter intrinsic patterns of inter-regional interactions in the\nhuman brain in a manner that is consistent with greater segregation of\ninformation processing in late childhood and adolescence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 01:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 01:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

This avoids the necessity of\nclassical zoom systems to shift multiple lenses along the longitudinal axis of\nthe setup. A rotationally tunable pair of saddle lens consists of two\nindividual saddle lenses (also known as quadrupole lenses, or biconic lenses),\nwhich are arranged directly behind each other, acting as a \"combi-saddle lens\".\nThe transmission function of such a combi-saddle lens corresponds to that of a\nsingle saddle lens, but with an adjustable optical power which depends on the\nmutual rotation angle between its two components. The optical system contains\ntwo of these combi-saddle lenses, and acts as a cylindrical Kepler telescope in\none plane, and as a cylindrical Galilei telescope in the orthogonal plane. The\ntwo orthogonal Kepler/Galilei telescopes stay aligned and change their\nmagnification factors in the same way when the telescope is zoomed by adjusting\nthe optical powers of the two combi-saddle lenses.

In many applications, the dependence structure is unknown and it is\ndesirable to learn it from data, often because it is a preliminary step to be\nable to ascertain causal effects. This problem, known as structure learning, is\nhard in general, but for Gaussian graphical models it is slightly easier\nbecause the structure of the graph is given by the sparsity pattern of the\nprecision matrix of the joint distribution, and because independence coincides\nwith decorrelation. A major difficulty too often ignored in structure learning\nis the fact that if some variables are not observed, the marginal dependence\ngraph over the observed variables will possibly be significantly more complex\nand no longer reflect the direct dependencies that are potentially associated\nwith causal effects. In this work, we consider a family of latent variable\nGaussian graphical models in which the graph of the joint distribution between\nobserved and unobserved variables is sparse, and the unobserved variables are\nconditionally independent given the others. Prior work was able to recover the\nconnectivity between observed variables, but could only identify the subspace\nspanned by unobserved variables, whereas we propose a convex optimization\nformulation based on structured matrix sparsity to estimate the complete\nconnectivity of the complete graph including unobserved variables, given the\nknowledge of the number of missing variables, and a priori knowledge of their\nlevel of connectivity.

To improve the quality of SAR\nimages and to reduce the costs of their generation, we propose a Dialectical\nGenerative Adversarial Network (Dialectical GAN) to generate high-quality SAR\nimages.

One such relationship\nis the fact that every Lagrangian leaf in the Toda lattice is compactified by a\nsuitable choice of Hessenberg variety. It is then natural to imagine the Toda\nlattice as extending to an appropriate union of Hessenberg varieties.\n  We fix a simply-connected complex semisimple linear algebraic group $G$ and\nrestrict our attention to a particular family of Hessenberg varieties, a family\nthat includes the Peterson variety and all Toda leaf compactifications. The\ntotal space of this family, $X(H_0)$, is shown to be a Poisson variety with a\ncompletely integrable system defined in terms of Mishchenko--Fomenko\npolynomials.

The first aim is to provide a deeper\nunderstanding of the family of the Real Elliptically Symmetric (RES)\ndistributions by investigating their intrinsic semiparametric nature. The\nsecond aim is to derive a semiparametric lower bound for the estimation of the\nparametric component of the model. The RES distributions represent a\nsemiparametric model where the parametric part is given by the mean vector and\nby the scatter matrix while the non-parametric, infinite-dimensional, part is\nrepresented by the density generator. Since, in practical applications, we are\noften interested only in the estimation of the parametric component, the\ndensity generator can be considered as nuisance. The first part of the paper is\ndedicated to conveniently place the RES distributions in the framework of the\nsemiparametric group models. The second part of the paper, building on the\nmathematical tools previously introduced, the Constrained Semiparametric\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao Bound (CSCRB) for the estimation of the mean vector and of the\nconstrained scatter matrix of a RES distributed random vector is introduced.\nThe CSCRB provides a lower bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of any robust\n$M$-estimator of mean vector and scatter matrix when no a-priori information on\nthe density generator is available. A closed form expression for the CSCRB is\nderived.

A mild connectivity\nassumption on the switching topologies is imposed, which allows them to be\ndirected and jointly connected. We propose a novel analysis framework from both\nalgebraic and geometric perspectives to justify the attractiveness of the\nsynchronization manifold. Specifically, it is proven that the complementary\nspace of the synchronization manifold can be spanned by certain subspaces.\nThese subspaces can be the eigenspaces of the nonzero eigenvalues of Laplacian\nmatrices in linear case. They can also be subspaces in which the projection of\nthe nonlinear self-dynamics still retains the Lipschitz property. This allows\nto project the states of the dynamical systems into these subspaces and\ntransform the synchronization problem under consideration equivalently into a\nconvergence one of the projected states in each subspace. Then, assuming the\njoint connectivity condition on the communication topologies, we are able to\nwork out a simple yet effective and unified convergence analysis for both types\nof dynamical systems. More specifically, for partial-state coupled generic\nlinear systems, it is proven that synchronization can be reached if an extra\ncondition, which is easy to verify in several cases, on the system dynamics is\nsatisfied.

Sometimes, however,\ntraditional electrical conductance or resistance measurements only provide very\nsmall signals, and thus limit the ability to obtain direct band structure\ninformation. In this case, it has been proven beneficial to employ\nthermoelectric measurements which are sensitive to the first derivative of the\ndensity of states with respect to energy, rather than to its value itself. Due\nto the large interest in topological effects these days, it is important to\nidentify a similar concept for detecting the Berry curvature in a band\nstructure. Nowadays, the common way to access the Berry curvature directly via\nmeasurements is the anomalous Hall effect, but the corresponding signal can be\ntoo small to be detected when the topological features of the band structure\nlie too far off the Fermi level. In this work we propose to investigate\ntopological band structure features utilizing the anomalous Nernst effect which\nis tied to the derivative of the anomalous Hall effect with respect to energy.\nThereby, also signatures become resolvable, which are elusive in anomalous Hall\nmeasurements.

Furthermore, many existing network\ndevices (e.g., switches) and collocated PMs are underutilized or\nover-provisioned, resulting in low power-efficiency. In order to achieve more\nenergy efficient systems, this work aims at designing the placement of VNFs\nsuch that the total power consumption in network nodes and PMs is minimized,\nwhile meeting the delay and capacity requirements of the foreseen demands.\nBased on existing switch and PM power models, we propose a Integer Linear\nProgramming (ILP) formulation to find the optimal solution. We also propose a\nheuristic based on the concept of Blocking Islands (BI), and a baseline\nheuristic based on the Betweenness Centrality (BC) property of the graph. Both\nheuristics and the ILP solutions have been compared in terms of total power\nconsumption, delay, demands acceptance rate, and computation time. Our\nsimulation results suggest that BI-based heuristic is superior compared with\nthe BC-based heuristic, and very close to the optimal solution obtained from\nthe ILP in terms of total power consumption and demands acceptance rate.\nCompared to the ILP, the proposed BI-based heuristic is significantly faster\nand results in 22% lower end-to-end delay, with a penalty of consuming 6% more\npower in average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 14:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 16:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

Recently, Cadambe et al. proposed the Coded Atomic Storage\n(CAS) algorithm, which uses erasure coding for achieving data redundancy with\nmuch lower communication cost than previous algorithmic solutions.\n  Although CAS can tolerate server crashes, it was not designed to recover from\nunexpected, transient faults, without the need of external (human)\nintervention. In this respect, Dolev, Petig, and Schiller have recently\ndeveloped a self-stabilizing version of CAS, which we call CASSS. As one would\nexpect, self-stabilization does not come as a free lunch; it introduces,\nmainly, communication overhead for detecting inconsistencies and stale\ninformation. So, one would wonder whether the overhead introduced by\nself-stabilization would nullify the gain of erasure coding.\n  To answer this question, we have implemented and experimentally evaluated the\nCASSS algorithm on PlanetLab; a planetary scale distributed infrastructure. The\nevaluation shows that our implementation of CASSS scales very well in terms of\nthe number of servers, the number of concurrent clients, as well as the size of\nthe replicated object. More importantly, it shows (a) to have only a constant\noverhead compared to the traditional CAS algorithm (which we also implement)\nand (b) the recovery period (after the last occurrence of a transient fault) is\nas fast as a few client (read/write) operations. Our results suggest that CASSS\ndoes not significantly impact efficiency while dealing with automatic recovery\nfrom transient faults and bounded size of needed resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 15:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 16:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

Building an uplift model requires two training sets: the\ntreatment group, where individuals have been subject to the action, and the\ncontrol group, where no action has been performed. An uplift model allows then\nto assess the gain resulting from taking the action on a given individual, such\nas the increase in probability of patient recovery or of a product being\npurchased. This paper describes an adaptation of the well-known boosting\ntechniques to the uplift modeling case. We formulate three desirable properties\nwhich an uplift boosting algorithm should have.

To solve this problem, transfer learning leverages the labeled\nsamples from the source domain to annotate the target domain which has few or\nnone labels. Unfortunately, when there are several source domains available, it\nis difficult to select the right source domains for transfer. The right source\ndomain means that it has the most similar properties with the target domain,\nthus their similarity is higher, which can facilitate transfer learning.\nChoosing the right source domain helps the algorithm perform well and prevents\nthe negative transfer. In this paper, we propose an effective Unsupervised\nSource Selection algorithm for Activity Recognition (USSAR). USSAR is able to\nselect the most similar $K$ source domains from a list of available domains.\nAfter this, we propose an effective Transfer Neural Network to perform\nknowledge transfer for Activity Recognition (TNNAR). TNNAR could capture both\nthe time and spatial relationship between activities while transferring\nknowledge.

The proposed\ndata-driven technique combines the deep learning framework with a\nprojection-based low-order modeling. While the deep learning provides\nlow-dimensional approximations from datasets arising from black-box solvers,\nthe projection-based model constructs the low-dimensional approximations by\nprojecting the original high-dimensional model onto a low-dimensional subspace.\nOf particular interest of this paper is to predict the long time series of\nunsteady flow fields of a freely vibrating bluff-body subjected to wake-body\nsynchronization. We consider convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the\nlearning dynamics of wake-body interaction, which assemble layers of linear\nconvolutions with nonlinear activations to automatically extract the\nlow-dimensional flow features. Using the high-fidelity time series data from\nthe stabilized finite element Navier-Stokes solver, we first project the\ndataset to a low-dimensional subspace by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)\ntechnique. The time-dependent coefficients of the POD subspace are mapped to\nthe flow field via a CNN with nonlinear rectification, and the CNN is\niteratively trained using the stochastic gradient descent method to predict the\nPOD time coefficient when a new flow field is fed to it. The time-averaged flow\nfield, the POD basis vectors, and the trained CNN are used to predict the long\ntime series of the flow fields and the flow predictions are quantitatively\nassessed with the full-order (high-dimensional) simulation data.

While PVA has shown large\ninter-rater variability, the more reliable and accurate alternative of\nQuantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) is challenging to perform in real-time\ndue to the busy workflow in cardiac catheterization laboratories. We propose a\ndeep learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that\nautomatically characterizes and analyzes coronary stenoses in real-time by\nautomating clinical tasks performed during QCA. Our deep learning methods for\nlocalization, segmentation and classification of stenosis in still-frame\ninvasive coronary angiography (ICA) images of the right coronary artery (RCA)\nachieve performance of 72.7% localization accuracy, 0.704 dice coefficient and\n0.825 C-statistic in each respective task. Integrated in an end-to-end\napproach, our model's performance shows statistically significant improvement\nin false discovery rate over the current standard in real-time clinical\nstenosis assessment, PVA. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the\nfirst time an automated machine learning system has been developed that can\nimplement tasks performed in QCA, and the first time an automated machine\nlearning system has demonstrated significant improvement over the current\nclinical standard for rapid RCA stenosis analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 17:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

Extracting meaningful information from images obtained from\nsuch microscopes remains a formidable challenge. Fourier analysis is commonly\nused to analyze the underlying structure of fundamental motifs present in an\nimage. However, the Fourier transform fundamentally suffers from severe phase\nnoise when applied to aperiodic images. Here, we report the development of a\nnew algorithm based on nonconvex optimization, applicable to any microscopy\nmodality, that directly uncovers the fundamental motifs present in a real-space\nimage. Apart from being quantitatively superior to traditional Fourier\nanalysis, we show that this novel algorithm also uncovers phase sensitive\ninformation about the underlying motif structure. We demonstrate its usefulness\nby studying scanning tunneling microscopy images of a Co-doped iron arsenide\nsuperconductor and prove that the application of the algorithm allows for the\ncomplete recovery of quasiparticle interference in this material. Our phase\nsensitive quasiparticle interference imaging results indicate that the pairing\nsymmetry in optimally doped NaFeAs is consistent with a sign-changing s+- order\nparameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

The aim of this study was to identify the\nideal configuration of arteries required to sustain an entire brain hemisphere\nbased on minimisation of the energy required to supply the tissue. The 3D\ndistribution of grey and white matter within a healthy human brain was first\nsegmented from Magnetic Resonance Images. A novel simulated annealing algorithm\nwas then applied to determine the optimal configuration of arteries required to\nsupply brain tissue. The model is validated through comparison of this ideal,\nentirely optimised, brain vasculature with the known structure of real\narteries. This establishes that the human cerebral vasculature is highly\noptimised; closely resembling the most energy efficient arrangement of vessels.\nIn addition to local adherence to fluid dynamics optimisation principles, the\noptimised vasculature reproduces global brain perfusion territories with well\ndefined boundaries between anterior, middle and posterior regions. This\nvalidated brain vascular model and algorithm can be used for patient-specific\nmodelling of stroke and cerebral haemodynamics, identification of sub-optimal\nconditions associated with vascular disease, and optimising vascular structures\nfor tissue engineering and artificial organ design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 15:41:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 17:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}
