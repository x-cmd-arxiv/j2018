In\nthe thermodynamic limit, the degrees of freedom are completely frozen in a\nregion near the boundary, while they are critically fluctuating in a central\nregion. The arctic curve is the phase boundary that separates those two\nregions. Critical fluctuations inside the arctic curve have been studied\nextensively, both in physics and in mathematics, in free models (i.e., models\nthat map to free fermions, or equivalently to determinantal point processes).\nHere we study those critical fluctuations in the interacting (i.e., not free,\nnot determinantal) six-vertex model, and provide evidence for the following two\nclaims:\n  (i) the critical fluctuations are given by a Gaussian Free Field (GFF), as in\nthe free case, but\n  (ii) contrarily to the free case, the GFF is inhomogeneous, meaning that its\ncoupling constant $K$ becomes position-dependent, $K \\rightarrow K({\\rm x})$.\n  The evidence is mainly based on the numerical solution of appropriate Bethe\nansatz equations with an imaginary extensive twist, and on transfer matrix\ncomputations, but the second claim is also supported by the analytic\ncalculation of $K$ and its first two derivatives in selected points. Contrarily\nto the usual GFF, this inhomogeneous GFF is not defined in terms of the Green's\nfunction of the Laplacian $\\Delta = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla$ inside the critical\ndomain, but instead, of the Green's function of a generalized Laplacian $\\Delta\n= \\nabla \\cdot \\frac{1}{K} \\nabla$ parametrized by the function $K$.\nSurprisingly, we also find that there is a change of regime when $\\Delta \\leq\n-1/2$, with $K$ becoming singular at one point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 16:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

In this paper, we introduce a new Spectre-class\nattack that we call SpectreRSB. In particular, rather than exploiting the\nbranch predictor unit, SpectreRSB exploits the return stack buffer (RSB), a\ncommon predictor structure in modern CPUs used to predict return addresses. We\nshow that both local attacks (within the same process such as Spectre 1) and\nattacks on SGX are possible by constructing proof of concept attacks.

In particular, on Core-i7\nSkylake and newer processors (but not on Intel's Xeon processor line), a patch\ncalled RSB refilling is used to address a vulnerability when the RSB\nunderfills; this defense interferes with SpectreRSB's ability to launch attacks\nthat switch into the kernel.

We find, for any\n$d$-dimensional system in an arbitrary initial state, provably optimal cooling\nprotocols with surprisingly simple structure and exponential convergence to the\nground state. Compared to the standard ones, these schemes can use fewer or no\nancillas and exploit memory effects to enhance cooling.

The current industry standard is Clifford randomized benchmarking\n(RB), which measures a single error rate that quantifies overall performance.\nBut scaling Clifford RB to many qubits is surprisingly hard. It has only been\nperformed on 1, 2, and 3 qubits as of this writing. This reflects a fundamental\ninefficiency in Clifford RB: the $n$-qubit Clifford gates at its core have to\nbe compiled into large circuits over the 1- and 2-qubit gates native to a\ndevice. As $n$ grows, the quality of these Clifford gates quickly degrades,\nmaking Clifford RB impractical at relatively low $n$. In this Letter, we\npropose a direct RB protocol that mostly avoids compiling. Instead, it uses\nrandom circuits over the native gates in a device, seeded by an initial layer\nof Clifford-like randomization. We demonstrate this protocol experimentally on\n2 -- 5 qubits, using the publicly available IBMQX5. We believe this to be the\ngreatest number of qubits holistically benchmarked, and this was achieved on a\nfreely available device without any special tuning up. Our protocol retains the\nsimplicity and convenient properties of Clifford RB: it estimates an error rate\nfrom an exponential decay. But it can be extended to processors with more\nqubits -- we present simulations on 10+ qubits -- and it reports a more\ndirectly informative and flexible error rate than the one reported by Clifford\nRB. We show how to use this flexibility to measure separate error rates for\ndistinct sets of gates, which includes tasks such as measuring an average CNOT\nerror rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 18:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 23:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

The existing neuro-evolution of augmenting\ntopology or NEAT paradigm offers a powerful alternative by allowing the network\ntopology and the connection weights to be simultaneously optimized through an\nevolutionary process. However, most NEAT implementations allow the\nconsideration of only a single objective. There also persists the question of\nhow to tractably introduce topological diversification that mitigates\noverfitting to training scenarios. To address these gaps, this paper develops a\nmulti-objective neuro-evolution algorithm. While adopting the basic elements of\nNEAT, important modifications are made to the selection, speciation, and\nmutation processes. With the backdrop of small-robot path-planning\napplications, an experience-gain criterion is derived to encapsulate the amount\nof diverse local environment encountered by the system. This criterion\nfacilitates the evolution of genes that support exploration, thereby seeking to\ngeneralize from a smaller set of mission scenarios than possible with\nperformance maximization alone. The effectiveness of the single-objective\n(optimizing performance) and the multi-objective (optimizing performance and\nexperience-gain) neuro-evolution approaches are evaluated on two different\nsmall-robot cases, with ANNs obtained by the multi-objective optimization\nobserved to provide superior performance in unseen scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 18:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

The general, exact non-Markovian result is expressed\nin terms of the classical velocity autocorrelation function, which represents\nan accumulated phase during a scattering event. The imaginary part of the\nexponent of the ISF is proportional to the accumulated phase, which is an\nantisymmetric function of the correlation time $t$. The expressions extend\nprevious results given in the quantum Langevin framework where the classical\nresponse of the bath was taken as Markovian.

First, detection probabilities -- perhaps\ndepending on covariates -- are estimated based on details of individual\nencounters; next, local densities are estimated using a GAM, by fitting local\nencounter rates to location and/or spatially-varying covariates while allowing\nfor the estimated detectabilities. One criticism of DSMs has been that\nuncertainty from the two stages is not usually propagated correctly into the\nfinal variance estimates. We show how to reformulate a DSM so that the\nuncertainty in detection probability from the distance sampling stage\n(regardless of its complexity) is captured as an extra random effect in the GAM\nstage.

When\ncompared to the atomistic description, the procedure of coarse-graining results\nin smoother free energy surfaces, longer-ranged potentials, a decrease in the\nnumber of interaction sites for a given polymer, and more. Because these\nchanges have competing effects on the computational efficiency of the CG model,\ncare needs to be taken when studying the effect of coarse-graining on the\ncomputational speed-up in CG molecular dynamics simulations. For instance,\ntreatment of long-range CG interactions requires the selection of cutoff\ndistances that include the attractive part of the effective CG potential and\nforce. In particular, we show how the complex nature of the range and curvature\nof the effective CG potential, the selection of a suitable CG timestep, the\nchoice of the cutoff distance, the molecular dynamics algorithms, and the\nsmoothness of the CG free energy surface affect the efficiency of IECG\nsimulations.

Therefore, the IECG method can have important applications\nin molecular dynamics simulations of polymeric systems. Finally, making use of\nthe standard spatial decomposition algorithm, the parallel scalability of the\nIECG simulations for various levels of CG is presented.

Estimating\ninformation accurately over a wide range of conditions relies on the\ndevelopment of flexible methods to describe statistical dependencies among\nvariables, without imposing potentially invalid assumptions on the data. Such\nmethods are needed in cases that lack prior knowledge of their statistical\nproperties and that have limited sample numbers. Here we propose a powerful and\ngenerally applicable information estimator based on non-parametric copulas.\nThis estimator, called the non-parametric copula-based estimator (NPC), is\ntailored to take into account detailed stochastic relationships in the data\nindependently of the data's marginal distributions. The NPC estimator can be\nused both for continuous and discrete numerical variables and thus provides a\nsingle framework for the mutual information estimation of both continuous and\ndiscrete data. By extensive validation on artificial samples drawn from various\nstatistical distributions, we found that the NPC estimator compares well\nagainst commonly used alternatives. Unlike methods not based on copulas, it\nallows an estimation of information that is robust to changes of the details of\nthe marginal distributions. Unlike parametric copula methods, it remains\naccurate regardless of the precise form of the interactions between the\nvariables. In addition, the NPC estimator had accurate information estimates\neven at low sample numbers, in comparison to alternative estimators. The NPC\nestimator therefore provides a good balance between general applicability to\narbitrarily shaped statistical dependencies in the data and shows accurate and\nrobust performance when working with small sample sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 20:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 20:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

We describe two methods to obtain one-parameter families of hybrid\nequations of state (EoS) which mimic the thermodynamic behavior of pasta phases\nin between a low-density hadron and a high-density quark matter phase, thus\ngeneralizing the Maxwell construction. The first method replaces the behavior\nof pressure vs. chemical potential in a finite region around the critical\n%chemical potential pressure of the Maxwell construction by a polynomial\ninterpolation. The second method uses extrapolations of the hadronic and quark\nmatter EoS beyond the Maxwell point to define a mixing of both with weight\nfunctions bounded by finite limits around the Maxwell point. We apply both\nmethods to the case of a hybrid EoS with a strong first order transition that\nentails the formation of a third family of compact stars and the corresponding\nmass twin phenomenon.

The interpretation of these observations relies on the comparison\nof the data to a gravitational wave model, which in turn depends on the orbital\nevolution of the binary, and in particular on its orbital energy and angular\nmomentum decay. In this paper, we calculate the latter in the inspiral of a\nnon-spinning compact binary system within Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory. From the\ntheory's gravitational wave stress energy tensor and a balance law, we compute\nthe angular momentum decay both as a function of the fields in the theory and\nas a function of the multipole moments of the binary. We then specialize to a\nKeplerian parameterization of the orbit to express the angular momentum decay\nas a function of the binary's orbital elements. We conclude by combining this\nwith the orbital energy decay to find expressions for the decay of the\nsemi-major axis and the orbital eccentricity of the binary. We find that these\nrates of decay are typically faster in Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory than in\nGeneral Relativity due to the presence of dipole radiation.

A major\nconcern regarding such systems are the seemingly unexpected large-scale\nfailures, which are often attributed to a small initial shock getting escalated\ndue to intricate dependencies within and across the individual counterparts of\nthe system. In this paper, we develop a novel interdependent system model to\ncapture this phenomenon, also known as cascading failures. Our framework\nconsists of two networks that have inherently different characteristics\ngoverning their intra-dependency: i) a cyber-network where a node is functional\nas long as it belongs to the largest connected (i.e., giant) component; and ii)\na physical network where nodes are given an initial flow and a capacity, and\nfailure of a node results with redistribution of its flow to the remaining\nnodes, upon which further failures might take place due to overloading (i.e.,\nthe flow of a node exceeding its capacity). Furthermore, it is assumed that\nthese two networks are inter-dependent. For simplicity, we consider a\none-to-one interdependency model where every node in the cyber-network is\ndependent upon and supports a single node in the physical network, and vice\nversa. We provide a thorough analysis of the dynamics of cascading failures in\nthis interdependent system initiated with a random attack. The system\nrobustness is quantified as the surviving fraction of nodes at the end of\ncascading failures, and is derived in terms of all network parameters involved\n(e.g., degree distribution, load/capacity distribution, failure size, etc.).\nAnalytic results are supported through an extensive numerical study. Among\nother things, these results demonstrate the ability of our model to capture the\nunexpected nature of large-scale failures and provide insights on improving\nsystem robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2018 00:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

Thus last year the authors introduced the\nMetric Violation Distance (MVD) problem, where the input is an undirected and\npositively-weighted complete graph, and the goal is to identify a minimum\ncardinality subset of edges whose weights can be modified such that the\nresulting graph is its own metric completion. This problem was shown to be\nAPX-hard, and moreover an $O(OPT^{1/3})$-approximation was shown, where $OPT$\nis the size of the optimal solution.\n  In this paper we introduce the Generalized Metric Violation Distance (GMVD)\nproblem, where the goal is the same, but the input graph is no longer required\nto be complete. For GMVD we prove stronger hardness results, and provide a\nsignificantly faster approximation algorithm with an improved approximation\nguarantee. In particular, we give an approximation-preserving reduction from\nthe well studied MultiCut problem, which is hard to approximate within any\nconstant factor assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. Our approximation factor\ndepends on deficit values, which for a given cycle is the largest single edge\nweight minus the sum of the weights of all its other edges. Note that no cycle\nhas positive deficit in a metric complete graph. We give an $O(c \\log\nn)$-approximation algorithm for \\gmvd, where $c$ is the number of distinct\npositive cycle deficit values in the input graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2018 03:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

In view of the\nfact that many bio-fluids closely follow the generalized Newtonian rheology,\nthe rheology of the surrounding swimming medium is considered to follow the\nCarreau-Yasuda viscosity model.

This paper addresses the problem of\nunsupervisedly detecting changes between two observed images acquired by\nsensors of different modalities with possibly different resolutions. These\nsensor dissimilarities introduce additional issues in the context of\noperational change detection that are not addressed by most of the classical\nmethods. This paper introduces a novel framework to effectively exploit the\navailable information by modelling the two observed images as a sparse linear\ncombination of atoms belonging to a pair of coupled overcomplete dictionaries\nlearnt from each observed image. As they cover the same geographical location,\ncodes are expected to be globally similar, except for possible changes in\nsparse spatial locations. Thus, the change detection task is envisioned through\na dual code estimation which enforces spatial sparsity in the difference\nbetween the estimated codes associated with each image. This problem is\nformulated as an inverse problem which is iteratively solved using an efficient\nproximal alternating minimization algorithm accounting for nonsmooth and\nnonconvex functions.

Meanwhile, it has\nbeen shown that for some fixed central energy density and with increasing\nvalues of $\\lambda$, the stellar mass both for the neutron stars and the\nstrange stars increases, while the total stellar radius $R$ exhibits the\nopposite behavior for both of the compact stars. It is concluded that for this\n$f(\\mathcal{G},T)$ stellar model, the maximum stellar mass can be boosted above\nthe observational limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 16:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

We propose two algorithms: the first allows users to target compression\nto specific network property, such as number of trainable variable (footprint),\nand produces a compressed model that satisfies the requested property while\npreserving the maximum amount of spectral energy in the responses of each\nlayer, while the second is a parameter-free heuristic that selects the\ncompression used at each layer by trying to mimic an ideal set of uncorrelated\nresponses.
