The idea is to first decompose the problem in a sequence of\ninductive steps and then to explicitly train the RNN to reproduce such steps.\nGeneralisation is achieved as the RNN is not allowed to learn an arbitrary\ninternal state; instead, it is tasked with mimicking the evolution of a valid\nstate. In particular, the state is restricted to a spatial memory map that\ntracks parts of the input image which have been accounted for in previous\nsteps. The RNN is trained for single inductive steps, where it produces updates\nto the memory in addition to the desired output. We evaluate our method on two\ndifferent visual recognition problems involving visual sequences: (1) text\nspotting, i.e. joint localisation and reading of text in images containing\nmultiple lines (or a block) of text, and (2) sequential counting of objects in\naerial images.

This weak\ndispersion makes electrons particularly susceptible to the effects of\ninteractions. Introducing several excitonic order parameters with\nspin-density-wave-like structure, we demonstrate that (i)~the band degeneracy\nis partially lifted by the interaction, and (ii)~the details of the low-energy\nspectrum becomes doping-dependent. For example, at or near the undoped state,\ninteractions separate the eight bands into two quartets (one quartet is almost\nfilled, the other is almost empty), while for two electrons per Moir\\'{e} cell,\nthe quartets are pulled apart, and doublets emerge. When the doping is equal to\none or three electrons per cell, the doublets split into singlets. Hole doping\nproduces similar effects. As a result, electronic properties (e.g., the density\nof states at the Fermi energy) demonstrate oscillating dependence on the doping\nconcentration. This allows us to reproduce qualitatively the behavior of the\nconductance observed recently in experiments [Cao et al., Nature {\\bf 556}, 80\n(2018)].

However, due to the evolution of Android platforms\nand malware, existing such techniques are widely limited by their need for\nconstant retraining that are costly, and reliance on new malware samples that\nmay not be timely available. As a result, new and emerging malware slips\nthrough, as seen from the continued surging of malware in the wild. Thus, a\nmore practical detector needs not only to be accurate but, more critically, to\nbe able to sustain its capabilities over time without frequent retraining. In\nthis paper, we study how Android apps evolve as a population over time, in\nterms of their behaviors related to accesses to sensitive information and\noperations. We first perform a longitudinal characterization of 6K benign and\nmalicious apps developed across seven years, with focus on these sensitive\naccesses in app executions. Our study reveals, during the long evolution, a\nconsistent, clear differentiation between malware and benign apps regarding\nsuch accesses, measured by relative statistics of relevant method calls.\nFollowing these findings, we developed DroidSpan, a novel classification system\nbased on a new behavioral profile for Android apps.

Upon increasing the wind shear\nstress $\\tau$ above a threshold value $\\tau^\\prime_t$, particles resting at the\nbed surface begin to rock in their pockets because the largest turbulent\nfluctuations of the instantaneous wind velocity above its mean value\n$\\overline{u}$ induce fluid torques that exceed resisting torques.

The advantage of the tunneling injection\nprocess stems from the fact that it avoids hot carrier injection, which is a\nkey performance-limiting factor in all semiconductor lasers. The tunneling\ninjection process is not fully understood microscopically and therefore it is\ndifficult to optimize those laser structures. We present here a numerical study\nof the broad band carrier dynamics in a tunneling injection quantum dot gain\nmedium in the form of an optical amplifier operating at 1.55 um. Charge carrier\ntunneling occurs in a hybrid state that joins the quantum dot first excited\nstate and the confined quantum well - injection well states. The hybrid state,\nwhich is placed energetically roughly one LO phonon above the ground state and\nhas a spectral extent of about 5 meV , dominates the carrier injection to the\nground state. We calculate the dynamical response of the inversion across the\nentire gain spectrum following a short pulse perturbation at various\nwavelengths and for two bias currents. At a high bias of 200 mA, the entire\nspectrum exhibits gain; at 30 mA, the system exhibits a mixed gain - absorption\nspectrum. The carrier dynamics in the injection well is calculated\nsimultaneously. We discuss the role of the pulse excitation wavelengths\nrelative to the gain spectrum peak and demonstrate that the injection well\nresponds to all perturbation wavelengths, even those which are far from the\nregion where the tunneling injection process dominates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 07:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

The\nintroduction of the adversarial network tackles the two problems using a single\ndiscriminator. However, the two types of parsing inconsistency are generated by\ndistinct mechanisms, so it is difficult for a single discriminator to solve\nthem both. To address the two kinds of inconsistencies, this paper proposes the\nMacro-Micro Adversarial Net (MMAN). It has two discriminators. One\ndiscriminator, Macro D, acts on the low-resolution label map and penalizes\nsemantic inconsistency, e.g., misplaced body parts. The other discriminator,\nMicro D, focuses on multiple patches of the high-resolution label map to\naddress the local inconsistency, e.g., blur and hole. Compared with traditional\nadversarial networks, MMAN not only enforces local and semantic consistency\nexplicitly, but also avoids the poor convergence problem of adversarial\nnetworks when handling high resolution images. In our experiment, we validate\nthat the two discriminators are complementary to each other in improving the\nhuman parsing accuracy. The proposed framework is capable of producing\ncompetitive parsing performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods,\ni.e., mIoU=46.81% and 59.91% on LIP and PASCAL-Person-Part, respectively. On a\nrelatively small dataset PPSS, our pre-trained model demonstrates impressive\ngeneralization ability.

Here we realize TPhPs by\nconstructing one-dimensional dimerized silicon carbide nanoparticle chains,\nwhich mimic the topological property of the well-known Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\n(SSH) model. We analytically calculate the complex band structure of such\nchains by taking all near-field and far-field dipole-dipole interactions into\naccount. For longitudinal modes, we demonstrate that, despite the\nnon-Hermiticity and breaking of the chiral symmetry, the band topology can be\nstill characterized by the complex Zak phase, which is quantized and indicates\na topological phase transition when the dimerization parameter $\\beta$ changes\nfrom less than 0.5 to larger than 0.5, like the conventional Hermitian SSH\nmodel.

On the other hand, for transverse modes, we discover a\ntopological phase transition by increasing the lattice constant, which is due\nto the presence of strong long-range far-field transverse dipole-dipole\ninteractions decaying with the distance $r$ as $1/r$ for an infinitely long\nchain. However, we surprisingly find the emergence of non-Hermitian skin effect\nin a finite chain, which leads to the breakdown of the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence. Furthermore, by incorporating the effect of localized bulk\neigenmodes and proposing a modified complex Zak phase for a finite lattice, we\nstill recover the topological behavior of the conventional SSH model.

Extensive numerical results are\npresented for the case when the viscosity of the drop and surrounding medium\nare comparable. Qualitative similarities are found between the evolution of a\ndrop with a thick Debye layer (characterized by the parameter $\\chi\\ll 1$,\nwhich is an inverse dimensionless Debye layer thickness) and a perfect\ndielectric drop in an insulating medium. In this limit, a highly elongated\nsteady state is obtained for sufficiently large imposed electric field, and the\nfield inside the drop is found to be well approximated using slender body\ntheory.

As a result,\nthere is the need to understand at a quantitative level how the interfacial\nproperties are determined by the properties of the constituent 2D materials. We\naddress this problem by studying the transport and optoelectronic response of\ntwo different interfaces based on transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers,\nnamely WSe2-MoSe2 and WSe2-MoS2. By exploiting the spectroscopic capabilities\nof ionic liquid gated transistors, we show how the conduction and valence bands\nof the individual monolayers determine the bands of the interface, and we\nestablish quantitatively (directly from the measurements) the energetic\nalignment of the bands in the different materials as well as the magnitude of\nthe interfacial band gap. Photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements allow\nus to conclude that the band gap of the WSe2-MoSe2 interface is direct in k\nspace, whereas the gap of WSe2/MoS2 is indirect. For WSe2/MoSe2, we detect the\nlight emitted from the decay of interlayer excitons and determine\nexperimentally their binding energy using the values of the interfacial band\ngap extracted from transport measurements. The technique that we employed to\nreach this conclusion demonstrates a rather-general strategy for characterizing\nquantitatively the interfacial properties in terms of the properties of the\nconstituent atomic layers. The results presented here further illustrate how\nvan der Waals interfaces of two distinct 2D semiconducting materials are\ncomposite systems that truly behave as artificial semiconductors, the\nproperties of which can be deterministically defined by the selection of the\nappropriate constituent semiconducting monolayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 13:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

Assessment of tumor proliferation in a clinical setting\nis highly subjective and labor-intensive task. Previous efforts to automate\ntumor proliferation assessment by image analysis only focused on mitosis\ndetection in predefined tumor regions. However, in a real-world scenario,\nautomatic mitosis detection should be performed in whole-slide images (WSIs)\nand an automatic method should be able to produce a tumor proliferation score\ngiven a WSI as input. To address this, we organized the TUmor Proliferation\nAssessment Challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) on prediction of tumor proliferation scores\nfrom WSIs. The challenge dataset consisted of 500 training and 321 testing\nbreast cancer histopathology WSIs. In order to ensure fair and independent\nevaluation, only the ground truth for the training dataset was provided to the\nchallenge participants. The first task of the challenge was to predict mitotic\nscores, i.e., to reproduce the manual method of assessing tumor proliferation\nby a pathologist. The second task was to predict the gene expression based\nPAM50 proliferation scores from the WSI. The best performing automatic method\nfor the first task achieved a quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa score of\n$\\kappa$ = 0.567, 95% CI [0.464, 0.671] between the predicted scores and the\nground truth. For the second task, the predictions of the top method had a\nSpearman's correlation coefficient of r = 0.617, 95% CI [0.581 0.651] with the\nground truth. This was the first study that investigated tumor proliferation\nassessment from WSIs. The achieved results are promising given the difficulty\nof the tasks and weakly-labelled nature of the ground truth.

Measuring their properties is therefore extremely important to probe\nthe core, but requires some care, due to the complexity of the mixed-mode\npattern. This work aims at providing a consistent description of the mixed-mode\npattern of low-mass stars, based on the asymptotic expansion. We also aim at\nstudying the variation of the gravity offset $\\varepsilon_{g}$ with stellar\nevolution. We revisit previous work about mixed modes in red giants and\nempirically test how period spacings, rotational splittings, mixed-mode widths\nand heights can be estimated in a consistent view, based on the properties of\nthe mode inertia ratios. From the asymptotic fit of the mixed-mode pattern of a\nlarge set of red giants at various evolutionary stages, we derive unbiased and\nprecise asymptotic parameters. As the asymptotic expansion of gravity modes is\nverified with a precision close to the frequency resolution for stars on the\nred giant branch (10$^{-4}$ in relative values), we can derive accurate values\nof the asymptotic parameters. We decipher the complex pattern in a rapidly\nrotating star, and explain how asymmetrical splittings can be inferred, as well\nas the stellar inclinations. This allows us to revisit the stellar inclinations\nin two open clusters, NGC 6819 and NGC 6791: our results show that the stellar\ninclinations in these clusters do not have privileged orientation in the sky.\nThe variation of the asymptotic gravity offset along with stellar evolution is\ninvestigated in detail.

Therefore, this research\naims at investigating the perceptions of hospitality students at the Faculty of\nTourism in Alexandria University towards the industry as a career choice. A\nself-administrated questionnaire was developed to rate the importance of 20\nfactors in influencing career choice, and the extent to which hospitality as a\ncareer offers these factors. From the results, it is clear that students\ngenerally do not believe that the hospitality career will offer them the\nfactors they found important. However, most of respondents (70.6%) indicated\nthat they would work in the industry after graduation. Finally, a set of\nspecific remedial actions that hospitality stakeholders could initiate to\nimprove the perceptions of hospitality career are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 12:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

Compared to conventional\nBayesian models based on Gaussian likelihood functions driven by the\nleast-squares norm ($L_2$ norm), the new framework features several advantages.\nFirst, the new framework does not rely on the likelihood of the measurement\nnoise and hence can treat complicated noise structures such as combined\nadditive and multiplicative noise. Secondly, unlike the normal likelihood\nfunction, the Wasserstein-based exponential likelihood function does not\nusually generate multiple local extrema. As a result, the new framework\nfeatures better convergence to correct posteriors when a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo sampling algorithm is employed. Thirdly, in the particular case of signal\nprocessing problems, while a normal likelihood function measures only the\namplitude differences between the observed and simulated signals, the new\nlikelihood function can capture both the amplitude and the phase differences.\nWe apply the new framework to a class of signal processing problems, that is,\nthe inverse uncertainty quantification of waveforms, and demonstrate its\nadvantages compared to Bayesian models with normal likelihood functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2018 17:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2018 12:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 22:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

In this paper, we propose a new\nquantum algorithm in three different forms to achieve LCU. Different from\nprevious algorithms [Childs-linear-system,Clader,Long11], the complexity now\nonly depends on the number of the unitaries and the precision. So it will play\nmore important role in the design of quantum algorithms when the number of\nunitaries is small, such as quantum iteration algorithms. %Since in iteration\nalgorithms, $m$ often refers to the iteration steps, which is small if the\niteration algorithms are efficient. Moreover, as an application of the new LCU,\nthree new quantum algorithms to the searching problem will be proposed, which\nwill provide us new insights into Grover's searching algorithm. We also show\nthat the problem of LCU is closely related to the problem of if we can\nefficiently implement $U^t$ for $0<t<1$ when $U$ is an efficiently implemented\nunitary operator? This problem is not hard to solve. However, it becomes\ninefficient when it contains a strict requirement on precision, such as in\nGrover's algorithm. Finally, as an application of the new LCU technique, we\nwill show that the quantum state of any real classical vector can be prepared\nefficiently in quantum computer. So this solves the \"input problem\" in quantum\ncomputer efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 08:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 01:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-17"}

The underlying idea of this method is to\ngenerate the optimal projection matrix by considering both the sparsity as well\nas the correlation of the data samples. The conventional L2-norm used in the\nobjective function is sensitive to noise and outliers. Therefore, in this work\nL1-norm is utilized as a robust alternative to L2-norm. Besides, for further\nimprovement of the results, we use a penalty function of trace lasso with the\nL1GC method. It adaptively balances the L2-norm and L1-norm simultaneously by\nconsidering the data correlation along with the sparsity. We obtain the optimal\nprojection matrix by maximizing the ratio of between-class dispersion to\nwithin-class dispersion using L1-norm with trace lasso as the penalty.\nFurthermore, an iterative procedure for this TL-L1GC method is proposed to\nsolve the optimization function. The effectiveness of this proposed method is\nevaluated on two benchmark HSI datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 07:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

Having used the one-loop correction, we employ\nthe NJL framework in the ultraviolet (UV) limit of the HL theory, with critical\nexponent $z=3$, to demonstrate in the IR limit that the symmetry of the\npotential at the critical coupling value is broken at $z=1$. We also derive the\neffective Higgs-like potential in the low energy regimes. Here the symmetry of\nthe effective potential will be broken near $z=1$ at a certain value of the\ncritical coupling. In our scenario, the scalar channel of the NJL model plays\nthe role of a composite inflaton. We find that the Lorentz invariance (LI)\nappears at the IR regime of the HL theory and employ the standard inflationary\n(slow-roll) paradigm as a probe of physics at very high energy. We compute\ninflationary parameters and compare them with recent Planck 2015 data.\nInterestingly, we discover that the predictions of the model are in perfect\nagreement with the Planck analysis. Our salient feature is that we used\ninflation to quantify the IR and UV fixed points of the underlying theory. We\ndiscover that the IR fixed point of HL gravity is compatible with the grand\nunified energy scale; whilst the UV fixed point is the Planck energy scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 02:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 10:16:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 12:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}
