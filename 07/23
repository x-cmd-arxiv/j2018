There are no new physical degrees of freedom in\nthis theory, but what is new is an enlargement of the domain of the existing\nphysical fields and of spacetime via the larger symmetry, thus curing the\ngeodesic incompleteness of the traditional theory. Invoking the softer behavior\nof an underlying theory of quantum gravity, I further argue that it is\nreasonable to ban higher curvature terms in the effective action, thus making\nthis EFTC mathematically well behaved at gravitational singularities, as well\nas geodesically complete, thus able to make new physics predictions. Using this\nEFTC, I show some predictions of surprising behavior of the universe at\nsingularities including a unique set of big-bang initial conditions that emerge\nfrom a dynamical attractor mechanism. I will illustrate this behavior with\ndetailed formulas and plots of the classical solutions and the quantum\nwavefunction that are continuous across singularities for a cosmology that\nincludes the past and future of the big bang. The solutions are given in the\ngeodesically complete global mini-superspace that is similar to the extended\nspacetime of a black hole or extended Rindler spacetime. The analytic\ncontinuation of the quantum wavefunction across the horizons describes the\npassage through the singularities. This analytic continuation solves a\nlong-standing problem of the singular (-1/r^2) potential in quantum mechanics\nthat dates back to Von Neumann. The analytic properties of the wavefunction\nalso reveal an infinite stack of universes sewn together at the horizons of the\ngeodesically complete space.

We first\nshow that the space complexity for a one-pass streaming algorithm to find a\nmaximal independent set is quadratic (i.e. we must store all edges). We further\nshow that the problem does not become much easier if we only require\napproximate maximality.\n  In the \"explicit\" vertex stream model, the input stream is a sequence of\nvertices making up the graph, where every vertex arrives along with its\nincident edges that connect to previously arrived vertices. Various graph\nproblems require substantially less space to solve in this setting than for\nedge-arrival streams. We show that every one-pass $c$-approximation algorithm\nfor maximum independent set (MIS) on explicit vertex streams requires space\n$\\Omega(\\frac{n^2}{c^7})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the input\ngraph, and it is already known that space $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\frac{n^2}{c^2})$ is\nnecessary and sufficient in the edge arrival model (Halld\\'orsson et al. 2012).\nThe MIS problem is thus not significantly easier to solve under the explicit\nvertex arrival order assumption.

With this approach, we aim to maximize the\nnovice's share of actions, while constraining the probability of failure.

Unfortunately, the best performance requires\nextensive parameter tuning and can be prone to overfitting. We propose\nPaloBoost, a Stochastic Gradient TreeBoost model that uses novel regularization\ntechniques to guard against overfitting and is robust to parameter settings.\nPaloBoost uses the under-utilized out-of-bag samples to perform gradient-aware\npruning and estimate adaptive learning rates. Unlike other Stochastic Gradient\nTreeBoost models that use the out-of-bag samples to estimate test errors,\nPaloBoost treats the samples as a second batch of training samples to prune the\ntrees and adjust the learning rates. As a result, PaloBoost can dynamically\nadjust tree depths and learning rates to achieve faster learning at the start\nand slower learning as the algorithm converges. We illustrate how these\nregularization techniques can be efficiently implemented and propose a new\nformula for calculating feature importance to reflect the node coverages and\nlearning rates. Extensive experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate\nthat PaloBoost is robust to overfitting, is less sensitivity to the parameters,\nand can also effectively identify meaningful features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 23:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

In recent years,\nsegmentation methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCN) have achieved\ngreat success in general images. This success is primarily due to the\nleveraging of large labelled datasets to learn features that correspond to the\nshallow appearance as well as the deep semantics of the images. However, the\ndependence on large dataset does not translate well into medical images. To\nimprove the FCN performance for skin lesion segmentations, researchers\nattempted to use specific cost functions or add post-processing algorithms to\nrefine the coarse boundaries of the FCN results. However, the performance of\nthese methods is heavily reliant on the tuning of many parameters and\npost-processing techniques.

We\nfind that a good description of the relative suppression of the ground and\nhigher excited quarkonium states, transverse momentum and centrality\ndistributions is achieved, when comparison to measurements at a center-of-mass\nenergy of 2.76 TeV is performed. Theoretical predictions for the highest Pb+Pb\ncenter-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV at the LHC, where new experimental results\nare being finalized are presented. Preliminary calculations for smaller\nsystems, such as Xe+Xe are also shown. Last but not least, the potential of jet\nsubstructure to shed light in the mechanisms of heavy flavor production is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 02:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end\nregion-based actor-action segmentation approach which relies on region masks\nfrom an instance segmentation algorithm. Our main novelty is to avoid labeling\npixels in a region mask independently - instead we assign a single action label\nto these pixels to achieve consistent action labeling.

The new formulation is based on the exact solution of Stokes\nequation generated by a linear continuous distribution of regularized forces\nalong a line segment. Therefore, a straight filament with linearly varying\nforces does not require discretization. A general filament is approximated by a\npiecewise linear curve in three dimensions where the length of each line\nsegment is chosen only based on the variation of the force field and the\ndesired accuracy of its piecewise linear approximation. The most significant\nadvantage of this formulation is that the values of the regularization\nparameter $\\epsilon$ and the length of the segments $h$ are decoupled as long\nas $\\epsilon<h$ so that $\\epsilon$ can be selected as a proxy for the radius of\nthe filament and $h$ is chosen to discretize the forces and torques. We analyze\nthe performance on test problems and present biological applications of sperm\nmotility based on existing models of swimming flagella in open space and near a\nplane wall. The results show, for example, that because the forces along the\nflagellum vary mildly, a flagellum can be approximated with as few as 11\nsegments of length $h$ while fixing the regularization parameter to\n$\\epsilon=h/30$, overcoming the need for hundreds of discretization nodes\nrequired by the MRS when $\\epsilon$ is small. The filament behaves like a\nslender cylindrical tube of radius $\\approx 0.97\\epsilon$ so that the value of\n$\\epsilon$ influences the flagellum's swimming speed. For fixed regularization,\ndoubling the number of line segments does not affect the results significantly\nas long as the force field is resolved.

These parameters are\ncommonly implemented as an array. Scaling up the problem means scaling up the\nsize of the array and this will quickly lead to a computational bottleneck. To\nget around this, the RL problem is commonly formulated to learn a specific task\nusing hand-crafted input features to curb the size of the array. In this\nreport, we discuss an alternative end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\napproach where the DRL attempts to learn general task representations which in\nour context refers to learning to play the Pong game from a sequence of screen\nsnapshots without game-specific hand-crafted features. We apply artificial\nneural networks (ANN) to approximate a policy of the RL model. The policy\nnetwork, via Policy Gradients (PG) method, learns to play the Pong game from a\nsequence of frames without any extra semantics apart from the pixel information\nand the score. In contrast to the traditional tabular RL approach where the\ncontents in the array have clear interpretations such as V or Q, the\ninterpretation of knowledge content from the weights of the policy network is\nmore illusive.

The simulations\nprovide detailed information of the microscopic events that lead to vortex ring\nemission through characteristic observables such as liquid current circulation,\ndrag force, and hydrodynamic mass. A series of simulations were performed to\ndetermine velocity thresholds for the onset of dissipation as a function of the\nsphere radius up to 1.8 nm and at external pressures of zero and 1 bar. The\nthreshold was observed to decrease with the sphere radius and increase with\npressure thus showing that the onset of dissipation does not involve roton\nemission events (Landau critical velocity), but rather vortex emission (Feynman\ncritical velocity), which is also confirmed by the observed periodic response\nof the hydrodynamic observables as well as visualization of the liquid current\ncirculation. An empirical model, which considers the ratio between the boundary\nlayer kinetic and vortex ring formation energies, is presented for\nextrapolating the current results to larger length scales. The calculated\ncritical velocity value at zero pressure for a sphere that mimics an electron\nbubble is in good agreement with the previous experimental observations at low\ntemperatures. The stability of the system against symmetry breaking was linked\nto its ability to excite quantized Kelvin waves around the vortex rings during\nthe vortex shedding process.

Existing domain\ngeneralization methods address the dataset bias problem by learning a\ndomain-invariant representation $h(X)$ that has the same marginal distribution\n$\\mathbb{P}(h(X))$ across multiple source domains.

In\nthis work we generalize these results to a large class of groups. We call a\ncountable group $G$ a DJ group if for every metrizable minimal action of $G$\nthere exists an essentially free minimal action disjoint from it. We show that\namenable groups are DJ and that the DJ property is preserved under direct\nproducts. We define a simple dynamical condition DDJ on minimal systems, which\nis a strengthening of the Gottchalk-Hedlund property, and we say that a group\n$G$ is DDJ if every minimal $G$-system has this property. The DJ property\nimplies DDJ and by means of an intricate construction we show that every\nfinitely generated DDJ group is also DJ. Residually finite, maximally almost\nperiodic and $C^*$-simple groups are all DDJ. Finally we show that\nFurstenberg's conjecture holds for every DDJ group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 09:09:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 15:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 05:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 11:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 05:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

Even less is known about the powerful flares routinely\nobserved from pre-main sequence stars, which might significantly influence the\nevolution of circumstellar disks. Observations of the NGC2264 star forming\nregion were obtained in Dec. 2011, simultaneously with three telescopes,\nChandra (X-rays), CoRoT (optical), and Spitzer (mIR), as part of the\n\"Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of NGC2264\" (CSI-NGC2264).

Seventy-eight X-ray flares with an optical and/or mIR\ncounterpart were detected. Their optical emission is found to correlate well\nwith, and to be significantly larger than, the X-ray emission. The slopes of\nthe correlations suggest that the difference becomes smaller for the most\npowerful flares. The mIR flare emission seems to be strongly affected by the\npresence of a circumstellar disk: flares from stars with disks have a stronger\nmIR emission with respect to stars without disks. This might be attributed to\nthe reprocessing of the optical (and X-ray) flare emission by the inner\ncircumstellar disk, providing evidence for flare-induced disk heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 10:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

In this paper we will report the main results\nobtained with AC-S8, showing that the additional fingers network is able to\nincrease the energy collected from the athermal part of the pulses (from the 6%\nof AC-S7 up to the 26 % with AC-S8). Furthermore, the finger design is able to\nprevent the quasiparticle recombination in the aluminum, assuring a fast pulse\nrising front (L/R limited). In our road map, the AC-S8 prototype is the last\nstep before the development of the CryoAC Demonstration Model (DM), which will\nbe the detector able to demonstrate the critical technologies expected in the\nCryoAC development programme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 12:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

Multiview observations are encoded in a cost\nvolume and then combined with the reference image to estimate the depth map\nusing an encoder-decoder network. By encoding the information from multiview\nobservations into the cost volume, our method achieves real-time performance\nand the flexibility of traditional methods that can be applied regardless of\nthe camera intrinsic parameters and the number of images.

Recently, most approaches to the task explored different DNN\narchitectures to combine the representations of the words in a segment and\ngenerate a segment representation that provides cues for intention. In this\nstudy, we explore means to generate more informative segment representations,\nnot only by exploring different network architectures, but also by considering\ndifferent token representations, not only at the word level, but also at the\ncharacter and functional levels. At the word level, in addition to the commonly\nused uncontextualized embeddings, we explore the use of contextualized\nrepresentations, which provide information concerning word sense and segment\nstructure. Character-level tokenization is important to capture\nintention-related morphological aspects that cannot be captured at the word\nlevel. Finally, the functional level provides an abstraction from words, which\nshifts the focus to the structure of the segment. We also explore approaches to\nenrich the segment representation with context information from the history of\nthe dialog, both in terms of the classifications of the surrounding segments\nand the turn-taking history. This kind of information has already been proved\nimportant for the disambiguation of DAs in previous studies. Nevertheless, we\nare able to capture additional information by considering a summary of the\ndialog history and a wider turn-taking context.

By introducing a matrix\natomic norm the 2D DOA estimation problem is turned into matrix atomic norm\nminimization (MANM) problem. Since the 2D-ANM gridless DOA estimation is\nprocessed by vectorizing the 2D into 1D estimation and solved via semi-definite\nprogramming (SDP), which is with high computational cost in 2D processing when\nthe number of antennas increases to large size.

Overcoming\ndrawbacks of single-stage detectors, we take aim at precisely detecting objects\nfor static and temporal scenes in real time. Firstly, as a dual refinement\nmechanism, a novel anchor-offset detection is designed, which includes an\nanchor refinement, a feature location refinement, and a deformable detection\nhead. This new detection mode is able to simultaneously perform two-step\nregression and capture accurate object features. Based on the anchor-offset\ndetection, a dual refinement network (DRNet) is developed for high-performance\nstatic detection, where a multi-deformable head is further designed to leverage\ncontextual information for describing objects. As for temporal detection in\nvideos, temporal refinement networks (TRNet) and temporal dual refinement\nnetworks (TDRNet) are developed by propagating the refinement information\nacross time. We also propose a soft refinement strategy to temporally match\nobject motion with the previous refinement. Our proposed methods are evaluated\non PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ImageNet VID datasets. Extensive comparisons on static\nand temporal detection verify the superiority of DRNet, TRNet, and TDRNet.\nConsequently, our developed approaches run in a fairly fast speed, and in the\nmeantime achieve a significantly enhanced detection accuracy, i.e., 84.4% mAP\non VOC 2007, 83.6% mAP on VOC 2012, 69.4% mAP on VID 2017, and 42.4% AP on\nCOCO.

Then, we observe that a remarkable simple algorithm, $B_{1}$, has\nvery small average case cost $AVG(B_{1}):=1+\\pi$, but very high worst case cost\n$WRS(B_{1}):=1+2\\pi$.\n  Motivated by the above, we introduce constrained optimization problem\n$_2Evac_{F2F}^w$, in which one is trying to minimize the average case cost of\nthe evacuation algorithm given that the worst case cost does not exceed $w$.\nThe problem is of special interest with respect to practical applications,\nsince a common objective in search-and-rescue operations is to minimize the\naverage completion time, given that a certain worst case threshold is not\nexceeded, e.g. for safety or limited energy reasons. Our main contribution is\nthe design and analysis of families of new evacuation parameterized algorithms\n$A(p)$ which can solve $_2Evac_{F2F}^w$, for every $w \\in\n[WRS(B_{1}),WRS(B_{2})]$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 14:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

The communication between\nusers employs time division duplex, with all users transmitting simultaneously\nto relays in one time slot and relays sending the processed information to all\nusers in the next time slot. The relay system consists of a large number of\nsingle antenna units that can form groups. Within each group, relays exchange\nchannel state information (CSI), signals received in the uplink and signals\nintended for downlink transmission. On the other hand, per-group CSI and\nuplink/downlink signals (data) are not exchanged between groups, which perform\nthe data processing completely independently. Assuming that the groups perform\nzero-forcing in both uplink and downlink, we derive a lower bound for the\nergodic sumrate of the described system as a function of the relay group size.\nBy close observation of this lower bound, it is concluded that the sumrate is\nessentially independent of group size when the group size is much larger than\nthe number of user pairs.

Both radio galaxies are of FR I type and are hosted by\nearly-type galaxies at a redshift of 0.138.

Its core coincides with a cataloged point-like X-ray\nsource, but no extended X-ray emission from a surrounding galaxy cluster was\ndetected.

We show that even though the charge density\nhas no obvious connection with nuclear short-range correlations, it can be used\nto extract properties of such correlations. This is accomplished by using the\nnuclear contact formalism to derive a relation between the charge density and\nthe proton-proton nuclear contacts that describe the probability of two protons\nbeing at close proximity. With this relation, the values of the proton-proton\ncontacts are extracted for various nuclei using only the nuclear charge density\nand a solution of the two-nucleon Schroedinger equation as inputs. For\nsymmetric nuclei, the proton-neutron contacts can also be extracted from the\ncharge density. Good agreement is obtained with previous extractions of the\nnuclear contacts.

The upstream vortex of the TCV\n(UV) is driven by the gradient of the oscillating-velocity across the laminar\nportion of the separated shear layer and is faithfully aligned with it. The\nsecondary vortex acts as a roller support that facilitates the rotation and\norientation of the TCV. A global oscillation in the flow-field around the\naerofoil is observed in all of the investigated angles of attack, including at\nzero angle of attack. The flow switches between an attached-phase against an\nadverse pressure gradient (APG) and a separated-phase despite a favourable\npressure gradient (FPG) in a periodic manner with some disturbed cycles. When\nthe direction of the oscillating-flow is clockwise, it adds momentum to the\nboundary layer and helps it to remain attached against the APG and vice versa.\nThe transition location along the separated shear layer moves upstream when the\noscillating-flow rotates in the clockwise direction causing early-transition\nand vice versa. The best description of the mechanism is that of a whirligig.\nWhen the oscillating-flow rotates in the clockwise direction, the UV whirls in\nthe clockwise direction and store energy until it is saturated, then the\nprocess is reversed. The present investigation paves the way for formulating a\ntime-accurate physics-based model of the LFO and stall prediction, and opens\nthe door for control of its undesirable effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 15:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

Sleep\ndisorders like sleep apnea are increasing in prevalence, with the rapid\nincrease in factors like obesity. Sleep apnea is most commonly treated with\nContinuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Presently, however, there is\nno mechanism to monitor a patient's progress with CPAP. Accurate detection of\nsleep stages from CPAP flow signal is crucial for such a mechanism. We propose,\nfor the first time, an automated sleep staging model based only on the flow\nsignal. Deep neural networks have recently shown high accuracy on sleep staging\nby eliminating handcrafted features. However, these methods focus exclusively\non extracting informative features from the input signal, without paying much\nattention to the dynamics of sleep stages in the output sequence. We propose an\nend-to-end framework that uses a combination of deep convolution and recurrent\nneural networks to extract high-level features from raw flow signal with a\nstructured output layer based on a conditional random field to model the\ntemporal transition structure of the sleep stages. We improve upon the previous\nmethods by 10% using our model, that can be augmented to the previous sleep\nstaging deep learning methods. We also show that our method can be used to\naccurately track sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleep\nstages that can be deployed for monitoring the response of CPAP therapy on\nsleep apnea patients.

When analyzed at the workforce\npopulation level, job hop analysis helps to gain insights of talent flow among\ndifferent jobs and organizations. Traditionally, surveys are conducted on job\nseekers and employers to study job hop behavior. Beyond surveys, job hop\nbehavior can also be studied in a highly scalable and timely manner using a\ndata driven approach in response to fast-changing job landscape. Fortunately,\nthe advent of online professional networks (OPNs) has made it possible to\nperform a large-scale analysis of talent flow. In this paper, we present a new\ndata analytics framework to analyze the talent flow patterns of close to 1\nmillion working professionals from three different countries/regions using\ntheir publicly-accessible profiles in an established OPN. As OPN data are\noriginally generated for professional networking applications, our proposed\nframework re-purposes the same data for a different analytics task. Prior to\nperforming job hop analysis, we devise a job title normalization procedure to\nmitigate the amount of noise in the OPN data. We then devise several metrics to\nmeasure the amount of work experience required to take up a job, to determine\nthat existence duration of the job (also known as the job age), and the\ncorrelation between the above metric and propensity of hopping. We also study\nhow job hop behavior is related to job promotion/demotion. Lastly, we perform\nconnectivity analysis at job and organization levels to derive insights on\ntalent flow as well as job and organizational competitiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 06:03:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 06:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

The sliding boundary condition has been introduced by David in\norder to study the boundary regularity of minimal sets. In order to do that an\nimportant step is to know the list of minimal boundary cones, that is to say\ntangent cones on boundary points of minimal surfaces. In this paper we focus on\ncones contained in an half-space and whose boundary can slide along the\nbounding hyperplane. After giving a classification of one-dimensional minimal\ncones in the half-plane we provide four new two-dimensional minimal cones in\nthe three-dimensional half space (which cannot be obtained as the Cartesian\nproduct of the real line with one of the previous cones).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 06:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

We consider the case where the coupling function $f(\\phi)$\ndecreases in time during inflation and, as a result, the electric component of\nthe energy density dominates over the magnetic one. The system of equations\nwhich governs the joint evolution of the scale factor, inflaton field, and\nelectric energy density is derived. The backreaction occurs when the electric\nenergy density becomes as large as the product of the slow-roll parameter\n$\\epsilon$ and inflaton energy density, $\\rho_{E}\\sim \\epsilon \\rho_{\\rm inf}$.\nIt affects the inflaton field evolution and leads to the scale-invariant\nelectric power spectrum and the magnetic one which is blue with the spectral\nindex $n_{B}=2$ for any decreasing coupling function.

Before his work, the origin of the radiation today\ncalled \"cosmic rays\" was strongly debated, as many scientists thought that\nthese particles came integrally from the crust of the Earth. There was however\nan active and rich research on the topic. Victor (at that time Viktor) Hess\nmeasured in 1912 the rate of discharge of an electroscope that flew aboard an\natmospheric balloon. Since the discharge rate increased as the balloon flew at\nhigher altitude, he concluded that the origin of part of the natural radiation\ncould not be terrestrial. For this discovery, Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize\nin 1936, and his experiment became legendary. The fundamental article published\nby Victor Hess in 1912, reporting a significant increase of the radiation as\naltitude increases, is translated and commented here. The decisive measurement\nwas performed in the last of the seven flights on aerostatic balloon described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 14:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 13:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

Methods of capturing the space environment depending on its\ndensity and the ship velocity are indispensable issues to extract the space\nenvironment as a propellant. This matter of neutral fluxes would use solar\nradiation to create ionization in a plasma thruster. Extracting propellant at\ncertain ranges look extremely promising where a low thrust device operates\ncontinuously to deliver a celestial target close at the speed of light.\nHowever, at longer distances, the density of space rapidly diminishes and it\nmay be impossible to maintain at a plasma thruster continuous operation mode\nbut instead might be workable with a pulsed engine. Nonetheless, at still\nlonger-range interstellar missions, the insufficient propellant will require\nexamining other alternatives than a plasma thruster for other candidate\npropulsion system, possibly either propellantless or a propulsor is driven by\nelectric and/or magnetic fields to satisfy these mission objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 15:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

Then the accuracy and efficiency of the method\nare analysed by comparison with both analytical solutions and a\nwell-established finite element method (ABAQUS). The results demonstrate that\nBSEM could efficiently provide instant sub-particle stress for irregular\nparticles with an optimized compromise between computational time and accuracy.\nThe effect of particles aspect ratio, coordination number and heterogeneity on\nthe sub-particle stress are discussed through parametric studies. Key\nconclusions on particle breakage are derived based on the analysis of the\ndistribution of the sub-particle tensile stress.

On the other hand, the\nrelations for estimation of the intrinsic diffusion coefficients of components\nas established by van Loo and integrated diffusion coefficients in a phase with\nnarrow homogeneity range as established by Wagner are currently available with\nrespect to the composition normalized variable only.

Further, the relations for estimation of the\nintrinsic diffusion coefficients of the components and integrated\ninterdiffusion coefficient are established with respect to the concentration\nnormalized variable, which were not available earlier. The veracity of these\nmethods is examined based on the estimation of data in Ni-Pd, Ni-Al and Cu-Sn\nsystems. Our analysis indicates that both the approaches are logically correct\nand there is small difference in the estimated data in these systems although a\nhigher difference could be found in other systems. The integrated\ninterdiffusion coefficients with respect to the concentration (or concentration\nnormalized variable) can only be estimated considering the ideal molar volume\nvariation.
