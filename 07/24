The Vadalog system is Oxford's\ncontribution to the VADA research programme, a joint effort of the universities\nof Oxford, Manchester and Edinburgh and around 20 industrial partners. As the\nmain contribution of this paper, we illustrate the first implementation of\nWarded Datalog+/-, a high-performance Datalog+/- system utilizing an aggressive\ntermination control strategy.

Two identical multi-object high\nresolution spectrographs are expected to simultaneously produce 1084 spectra\nwith high resolution of 40,000 at Blue (401-416nm) and Green (472-489nm)\nchannels, and 20,000 at Red (626-674nm) channel. At the Conceptual Design Phase\n(CoDP), different optical schemes were proposed to meet the challenging\nrequirements, especially a unique design with a novel transmission image slicer\narray, and another conventional design with oversize Volume Phase Holographic\n(VPH) gratings. It became clear during the CoDP that both designs presented\nproblems of complexity or feasibility of manufacture, especially high line\ndensity disperser (general name for all kinds of grating, grism, prism). At the\npresent, a new design scheme is proposed for investigating the optimal way to\nreduce technical risk and get more reliable estimation of cost and timescale.\nIt contains new dispersers, F/2 fast collimator and so on. Therein, the\ndisperser takes advantage of a special grism and a prism to reduce line density\non grating surface, keep wide opening angle of optical path, and get the\nsimilar spectrum layout in all three spectral channels. For the fast\ncollimator, it carefully compares on-axis and off-axis designs in throughput,\ninterface to fiber assembly and technical risks. The current progress is more\ncompetitive and credible than the previous design, but it also indicates more\nchallenging work will be done to improve its accessibility in engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 16:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

The nuclear spin T$_1$ and the build-up time for\nthe optically-induced $^{31}$P hyperpolarization in the natural abundance\nsilicon sample were observed to be $178\\pm47$ s and $69\\pm6$ s respectively,\nsignificantly shorter than the values previously measured in $^{28}$Si-enriched\nsamples under the same conditions. We also measured the T$_1$ and\nhyperpolarization build-up time for the $^{31}$P signal in natural abundance\nsilicon at 9.4 T to be $54\\pm31$ s and $13\\pm2$ s respectively. The shorter\nbuild-up and nuclear spin T$_1$ times at high field are likely due to the\nshorter electron-spin T$_1$, which drives nuclear spin relaxation via\nnon-secular hyperfine interactions. At 6.7 T, the phosphorus nuclear spin\nT$_{2}$ was measured to be $16.7\\pm1.6$ ms at 4.2 K, a factor of 4 shorter than\nin $^{28}$Si-enriched crystals. This was observed to further shorten to\n$1.9\\pm0.4$ ms in the presence of the infra-red laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

SNe that are randomly\ndistributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because\nmost supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of\nthe disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered\nalleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of\nclustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well\nbefore the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are\nreduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy\nreleased by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These\nenergetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject\nsubstantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star\nformation rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by\nthe SNe, because the hot gas vents before doing significant work on the\nsurroundings.

During the first part of the outburst (MJD\n58004-58012), the source shows an optical-NIR spectrum that is consistent with\nan optically thin synchrotron power-law from a jet.

A significant softening of the X-ray\nspectrum is evident contemporaneous with the infrared fade.

The first GW memory effect\ndiscovered was a lasting change in the GW strain. It can occur when GWs or\nmassless fields carry away 4-momentum from an isolated source. Subsequently, it\nwas shown that fluxes of intrinsic angular momentum can generate a new type of\nmemory effect called the spin memory, which is an enduring change in a portion\nof the time integral of the GW strain. In this paper, we note that there is\nanother new type of memory effect. We call it the center-of-mass (CM) memory\neffect, because it is related to changes in the CM part of the angular momentum\nof a spacetime. We first examine a few properties of the CM angular momentum.\nSpecifically, we describe how it transforms under the supertranslation symmetry\ntransformations of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group, and we compute a new\nexpression for the flux of CM angular momentum carried by GWs in terms of a set\nof radiative multipole moments of the GW strain. We then turn to the CM memory\neffect. The CM memory effect appears in a quantity which has units of the time\nintegral of the GW strain. We define the effect in asymptotically flat\nspacetimes that start in a stationary state, radiate, and settle to a different\nstationary state. We show that it is invariant under infinitesimal\nsupertranslation symmetries in this context. To determine the magnitude of the\nflux of CM angular momentum and the CM memory effect, we compute these\nquantities for nonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries in the\npost-Newtonian approximation. The CM memory effect arises from terms in the\ngravitational waveform for such binaries beginning at third and fourth\npost-Newtonian order for unequal- and equal-mass binaries, respectively.\n[Abstract abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 18:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 09:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Average runtime of the deployed\nmodels on an iPhone 6S equates to ~45 fps, suggesting that the proposed\narchitectures are also well suited for real-time deployment on video streams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 18:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

In this paper, we propose a novel technique that\nautomatically identifies relevant and specific API classes from Stack Overflow\nQ & A site for a programming task written as a natural language query, and then\nreformulates the query for improved code search. We first collect candidate API\nclasses from Stack Overflow using pseudo-relevance feedback and two term\nweighting algorithms, and then rank the candidates using Borda count and\nsemantic proximity between query keywords and the API classes. The semantic\nproximity has been determined by an analysis of 1.3 million questions and\nanswers of Stack Overflow. Experiments using 310 code search queries report\nthat our technique suggests relevant API classes with 48% precision and 58%\nrecall which are 32% and 48% higher respectively than those of the\nstate-of-the-art. Comparisons with two state-of-the-art studies and three\npopular search engines (e.g., Google, Stack Overflow, and GitHub native search)\nreport that our reformulated queries (1) outperform the queries of the\nstate-of-the-art, and (2) significantly improve the code search results\nprovided by these contemporary search engines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 19:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Previous studies focused individually on the giant stellar\nstream or the impact of M32 on M31's disk, thereby suggesting many substantial\nsatellite interactions. Yet models of M31's disk heating and the similarity\nbetween the stellar populations of different tidal substructures in M31's\noutskirts both suggested a single large merger. M31's stellar halo (its outer\nlow-surface-brightness regions) is built up from the tidal debris of satellites\nand provides information about its important mergers. Here we use cosmological\nmodels of galaxy formation to show that M31's massive and metal-rich stellar\nhalo, containing intermediate-age stars, dramatically narrows the range of\nallowed interactions, requiring a single dominant merger with a large galaxy\n(with stellar mass about 2.5 x 10^10 solar masses, the third largest member of\nthe Local Group) about 2 Gyr ago. This single event explains many observations\nthat were previously considered separately: M31's compact and metal-rich\nsatellite M32 is likely to be the stripped core of the disrupted galaxy, its\nrotating inner stellar halo contains most of the merger debris, and the giant\nstellar stream is likely to have been thrown out during the merger. This\ninteraction may explain M31's global burst of star formation about 2 Gyr ago in\nwhich approximately a fifth of its stars were formed. Moreover, M31's disk and\nbulge were already in place, suggesting that mergers of this magnitude need not\ndramatically affect galaxy structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 20:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

One of the possible mechanisms for producing vortices\nis the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). In our previous work, we have performed\ndetailed linear stability analyses of the RWI with various initial conditions.\nIn this paper, we perform numerical simulations of the vortex formation by the\nRWI in 2D barotropic disks using the Athena++ code. As initial conditions, we\nconsider axisymmetric disks with a Gaussian surface density bump of various\ncontrasts and half-widths. Perturbations grow as expected from the linear\nstability analyses in the linear and weakly non-linear regimes. After the\nsaturation, multiple vortices are formed in accordance with the most unstable\nazimuthal mode and coalesce one after another. In the end, only one\nquasi-stationary vortex (the RWI vortex) remains, which migrates inward. During\nthe RWI evolution, the axisymmetric component approaches the stable\nconfiguration. We find that the axisymmetric component reaches the marginally\nstable state for the most unstable azimuthal mode at the saturation and the\nmarginally stable state for the m = 1 mode at the final vortex merger. We\ninvestigate the structure and evolution of the RWI vortices. We obtain some\nempirical relations between the properties of the RWI vortices and the initial\nconditions.

They enable multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain\nstable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional\ninteractions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting\npartners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise\nmaximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of\namino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of\nmulti-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of\nknown interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have\nbeen developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners\namong the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data\nalone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner\nidentification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual\ninformation between the sequence alignments of the two protein families.

Radio-band 21-cm absorption traces the cold gas and\ncomparison with the Lyman-alpha absorption, which traces all of the gas,\nprovides a measure of the cold gas fraction or the spin temperature. The recent\nstudy has shown that the spin temperature (degenerate with the ratio of the\nabsorber/emitter extent) appears to be anti-correlated with the star formation\ndensity, undergoing a similar steep evolution as the star formation rate over\nredshifts of 0 < z < 3, whereas the total neutral hydrogen exhibits little\nevolution.

The polarization of the individual\nNV centres in the diamond is dependent on the separation of the NV$^-$ and the\nnitrogen donor. When the NV$^-$ - N$^+$ pair separation is large the properties\nof the pair will be as for single sites and a high degree of spin polarization\nattainable. When the separation decreases the emission is reduced, the lifetime\nshortened and the spin polarization downgraded. The deterioration occurs as a\nconsequence of electron tunneling in the excited state from NV$^-$ to N$^+$ and\nresults in an optical cycle that includes NV$^0$. The tunneling process is\nlinear in optical excitation and more prevalent the closer the N$^+$ is to the\nNV$^-$ centre. However, the separation between the NV$^-$ and its donor N$^+$\ncan be effected by light through the excitation of NV$^-$ and/or ionization of\nN$^0$. The optical excitation that creates the spin polarization can also\nmodify the sample properties and during excitation creates charge dynamics. The\nconsequence is that the magnitude of spin polarization, the spin relaxation and\ncoherence times T$_1$ and T$_2$ have a dependence on the nitrogen concentration\nand on the excitation wavelength. The adjacent N$^+$ gives an electric field\nthat Stark shifts the NV$^-$ transitions and for an ensemble results in line\nbroadening. It is observation of changes of these Stark induced effects that\nallow the variation in NV$^-$ - N$^+$ separation to be monitored.

The\npredominant implementation of GP regression is a nonparameteric kernel-based\napproach, as it enables fitting of arbitrary nonlinear functions. However, this\napproach suffers from two main drawbacks: (1) it is computationally\ninefficient, as computation scales poorly with the number of samples; and (2)\nit can be data inefficient, as encoding prior knowledge that can aid the model\nthrough the choice of kernel and associated hyperparameters is often\nchallenging and unintuitive. In this work, we propose ALPaCA, an algorithm for\nefficient Bayesian regression which addresses these issues. ALPaCA uses a\ndataset of sample functions to learn a domain-specific, finite-dimensional\nfeature encoding, as well as a prior over the associated weights, such that\nBayesian linear regression in this feature space yields accurate online\npredictions of the posterior predictive density. These features are neural\nnetworks, which are trained via a meta-learning (or \"learning-to-learn\")\napproach. ALPaCA extracts all prior information directly from the dataset,\nrather than restricting prior information to the choice of kernel\nhyperparameters. Furthermore, by operating in the weight space, it\nsubstantially reduces sample complexity. We investigate the performance of\nALPaCA on two simple regression problems, two simulated robotic systems, and on\na lane-change driving task performed by humans.

The proposed method\nis computationally efficient and naturally amenable to parallel computing, and\neasily extends to a wide variety of network models. We demonstrate through\nsimulation studies that the egonet method works well under a wide variety of\nnetwork models.

It is poorly understood which, if any, of the currently available\nmachine learning algorithms will best predict new candidate drugs. 25 publicly\navailable molecular datasets were extracted from ChEMBL. Neural nets, random\nforests, support vector machines (regression) and ridge regression were then\nfitted to the structure-activity data. A new validation method, based on\nquantile splits on the activity distribution function, is proposed for the\nconstruction of training and testing sets. Model validation based on random\npartitioning of available data favours models which overfit and `memorize' the\ntraining set, namely random forests and deep neural nets. Partitioning based on\nquantiles of the activity distribution correctly penalizes models which can\nextrapolate onto structurally different molecules outside of the training data.\nThis approach favours more constrained models, namely ridge regression and\nsupport vector regression. In addition, our new rank-based loss functions give\nconsiderably different results from mean squared error highlighting the\nnecessity to define model optimality with respect to the decision task at hand.\nModel performance should be evaluated from a decision theoretic perspective\nwith subjective loss functions. Data-splitting based on the separation of high\nand low activity data provides a robust methodology for determining the best\nextrapolating model.

Bivariate meta-analysis methods can be used to evaluate surrogate\nendpoints and to predict the treatment effect on the final outcome from the\ntreatment effect measured on a surrogate endpoint. However, candidate surrogate\nendpoints are often imperfect, and the level of association between the\ntreatment effects on the surrogate and final outcomes may vary between\ntreatments.

In\nthe present scheme, two lasers, probe and pump, form a V-type system by\ncoupling the ground state to the excited states while an additional 2D standing\nmicrowave field is used to couple the excited states. The solutions of the\ndensity matrix equations reveal that the off-diagonal density matrix element\n$\\rho_{31}$, which signify the coherence between the states connected by the\nprobe laser, is position dependent. As the imaginary part of $\\rho_{31}$ is\nproportional to the imaginary part of the susceptibility, the probe absorption\nalso becomes position dependent and in this situation one can readily obtain\ninformation about the atom position from the probe absorption spectra. Perfect\n2D atom localization can be achieved by carefully selecting different system\nparameters such as detuning, relative phase, dephasing and field strength.

In\nthis article, we compare the relative strength of radio Doppler and laser range\ndata for the retrieval of parameters of interest in planetary missions, to\nclarify and quantify the science case of ILR, with a focus on geodetic\nobservables.\n  We first provide an overview of the near-term attainable quality of ILR, in\nterms of both the realization of the observable and the models used to process\nthe measurements.

This in-vitro study aims to validate the accuracy of two\nbubble counters using monodisperse bubbles in a highly controlled setting at\nlow GME concentrations. Monodisperse GME with a radius of 43 {\\mu}m were\nproduced in a microfluidic chip. Directly after their formation, they were\ninjected one-by-one into the BCC200 and the EDAC sensors. GME size and count\nwere optically verified using high-speed imaging. During best-case scenarios or\nlow GME concentrations of GME with a size of 43 {\\mu}m in radius in an in-vitro\nsetup, the BCC200 overestimates GME size by a factor of 2 to 3 while the EDAC\nunderestimates the average GME size by at least a factor of two. The BCC200\noverestimates the GME concentration by approximately 20% while the EDAC\noverestimates the concentration by nearly one order of magnitude. Nevertheless,\nthe calculated total GME volume is only over-predicted by a factor 2 since the\nEDAC underestimates the actual GME size. For the BCC200, the total GME volume\nwas over-predicted by 25 times due to the over-estimation of GME size. The\nmeasured errors in the absolute sizing/counting of GME do not imply that all\nresults obtained using the bubble counters are insignificant or invalid. A\nrelative change in bubble size or bubble concentration can accurately be\nmeasured. However, care must be taken in the interpretation of the results and\ntheir absolute values. Moreover, the devices cannot be used interchangeably\nwhen reporting GME activity. Nevertheless, both devices can be used to study\nthe relative air removal characteristics of CPB components or for the\nquantitative monitoring of GME production during CPB interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 08:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Most previous work considered each of these\nprocesses, learning and variability, in isolation -- here we study neural\nnetworks exhibiting both and show that their interaction leads to the emergence\nof powerful computational properties. We trained neural networks on classical\nunsupervised learning tasks, in which the objective was to represent their\ninputs in an efficient, easily decodable form, with an additional cost for\nneural reliability which we derived from basic biophysical considerations. This\ncost on reliability introduced a tradeoff between energetically cheap but\ninaccurate representations and energetically costly but accurate ones. Despite\nthe learning tasks being non-probabilistic, the networks solved this tradeoff\nby developing a probabilistic representation: neural variability represented\nsamples from statistically appropriate posterior distributions that would\nresult from performing probabilistic inference over their inputs. We provide an\nanalytical understanding of this result by revealing a connection between the\ncost of reliability, and the objective for a state-of-the-art Bayesian\ninference strategy: variational autoencoders. We show that the same cost leads\nto the emergence of increasingly accurate probabilistic representations as\nnetworks become more complex, from single-layer feed-forward, through\nmulti-layer feed-forward, to recurrent architectures. Our results provide\ninsights into why neural responses in sensory areas show signatures of\nsampling-based probabilistic representations, and may inform future deep\nlearning algorithms and their implementation in stochastic low-precision\ncomputing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 08:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Absorption energies of the S1<-S0 vertical\ntransition have been computed using different levels of theory, such as TDDFT,\nCC2 and many body Green's function Theory (MBGFT). The use of MBGFT, by means\nof the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) formalism, on VMC structures provides results in\nexcellent agreement with the value (2.26(8) eV) obtained by action spectroscopy\nexperiments for the keto-1 form (2.32 eV). To unravel the role of the quality\nof the optimized ground state geometry, BS excitation energies have also been\ncomputed on CASSCF geometries, inducing a non negligible blue shift (0.08 and\n0.07 eV for keto-1 and enol-1 forms, respectively) with respect to the VMC\nones. Structural effects have been analyzed in terms of over- or\nunder-correlation along the conjugated bonds of OxyLuc by using different\nmethods for the ground-state optimization. The relative stability of the S$_1$\nstate for the keto-1 and enol-1 forms depends on the method chosen for the\nexcited state calculation, thus representing a fundamental caveat for any\ntheoretical study on these systems.

How, then, should speakers and\nlisteners allocate their resources to achieve successful communication? We\nbegin with the observation that this shared goal induces a natural division of\nlabor: the resources one agent chooses to allocate toward perspective-taking\nshould depend on their expectations about the other's allocation. We formalize\nthis idea in a resource-rational model augmenting recent probabilistic\nweighting accounts with a mechanism for (costly) control over the degree of\nperspective-taking. In a series of simulations, we first derive an intermediate\ndegree of perspective weighting as an optimal tradeoff between expected costs\nand benefits of perspective-taking. We then present two behavioral experiments\ntesting novel predictions of our model. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the\npresence or absence of occlusions in a director-matcher task and found that\nspeakers spontaneously produced more informative descriptions to account for\n\"known unknowns\" in their partner's private view. In Experiment 2, we compared\nthe scripted utterances used by confederates in prior work with those produced\nin interactions with unscripted directors. We found that confederates were\nsystematically less informative than listeners would initially expect given the\npresence of occlusions, but listeners used violations to adaptively make fewer\nerrors over time. Taken together, our work suggests that people are not simply\n\"mindblind\"; they use contextually appropriate expectations to navigate the\ndivision of labor with their partner. We discuss how a resource rational\nframework may provide a more deeply explanatory foundation for understanding\nflexible perspective-taking under processing constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 09:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 07:44:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 20:07:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 23:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

In this article, we simulate the quench dynamics of\none-dimensional Bose gas in an optical lattice from an{\\it {ab initio}}\nperspective by solving the time-dependent many-boson Schr\\\"odinger equation\nusing the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons\n(MCTDHB).

We show that although the Bose-Hubbard\nmodel predicts identical physics, the general many-body treatment shows\nsignificant differences between the two cases. We observe that lattice depth\nquench exhibits a large time-scale to reach the MI state and shows an\noscillatory phase collapse-revival dynamics and a complete absence of\nthermalization that reveals through the analysis of the time-evolution of the\nreduced one-body density matrix, two-body density, and entropy production.

We allow the relation between the poloidal\nand toroidal stream functions - that characterizes the magnetosphere - to\nevolve freely without constraining its particular form. We find that, on\ntime-scales of the order of kyr, the energy stored in the magnetosphere\ngradually increases, as the toroidal region grows and the field lines expand\noutwards. This continues until a critical point is reached beyond which\nforce-free solutions for the magnetosphere can no longer be constructed, likely\nleading to some large-scale magnetospheric reorganization.

Allowing currents to\npass through the last few meters below the surface, where the magnetic\ndiffusivity is orders of magnitude larger than in the crust, should give rise\nto a considerable amount of energy deposition through Joule heating.

We present numerical examples of optimized thermal and\nisothermal oil recovery strategies and discuss the computational performance of\nthe dynamic optimization algorithm in these examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 11:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

The lack of an active link also\nprovides information about the network. To exploit the information that remains\nuncovered by structural balance, we introduce the inactive relationship that\naccounts for both neutral and nonexistent ties between two agents. This\naddition results in ten types of triads, with the advantage that the network\nanalysis can be done with complete networks. To each type of triadic\nrelationship, we assign an energy that is a measure for its average occupation\nprobability. Finite temperatures account for a persistent form of disorder in\nthe formation of the triadic relationships. We propose a Hamiltonian with three\ninteraction terms and a chemical potential (capturing the cost of edge\nactivation) as an underlying model for the triadic energy levels. Our model is\nsuitable for empirical analysis of political networks and allows to uncover\ngenerative mechanisms. It is tested on an extended data set for the standings\nbetween two classes of alliances in a massively multi-player on-line game\n(MMOG) and on real-world data for the relationships between countries during\nthe Cold War era.

The bending angle depends on the stellar compactness, which is the\nratio of stellar mass $M$ to radius $R$. In this paper, we investigate the\npulse profile of highly compact rotating neutron stars for which the bending\nangle exceeds $\\pi/2$. When $M/R > 0.284$ (the bending angle becomes equal to\n$\\pi/2$ for the stellar model with $M/R=0.284$), such a large bending happens,\nresulting in that a photon emitted from any position on the stellar surface can\nreach an observer. First, we classify the parameter plane of inclination angle\n$i$ and angle $\\Theta$ between the rotation axis and the normal on the hot spot\nby the number of photon paths reaching the observer. Then, we estimate the\ntime-dependent flux of photons emitted from two hot spots on the rotating\nneutron star, associated with the magnetic polar caps, for various combinations\nof $i$ and $\\Theta$, and for two values of compactness, assuming that the\nstellar rotation is not so fast that the frame dragging and the stellar\ndeformation are negligible. As the result, we find that the pulse profiles of\nhighly compact neutron stars are qualitatively different from those for the\nstandard neutron stars. In particular, the ratio of the maximum observed flux\nto the minimum one is significantly larger than that for the standard neutron\nstars.

In\norder to avoid the high cost of full supervision, we propose to use a diverse\ndata set, which consists of two types of annotations: (i) a small number of\nimages are labeled using the expensive ground-truth pose; and (ii) other images\nare labeled using the inexpensive action label. As action information helps\nnarrow down the pose of a human, we argue that this approach can help reduce\nthe cost of training without significantly affecting the accuracy. To\ndemonstrate this we design a probabilistic framework that employs two\ndistributions: (i) a conditional distribution to model the uncertainty over the\nhuman pose given the image and the action; and (ii) a prediction distribution,\nwhich provides the pose of an image without using any action information. We\njointly estimate the parameters of the two aforementioned distributions by\nminimizing their dissimilarity coefficient, as measured by a task-specific loss\nfunction. During both training and testing, we only require an efficient\nsampling strategy for both the aforementioned distributions. This allows us to\nuse deep probabilistic networks that are capable of providing accurate pose\nestimates for previously unseen images.

In\ncomparison with other machine learning methods (e.g. DNN), MPNN can enhance the\nmass reach of stop mass by several tens of GeV to over a hundred GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 13:19:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 05:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In this\npaper, a risk-averse online learning problem under the performance measure of\nthe mean-variance of the rewards is studied. Both the bandit and full\ninformation settings are considered. The performance of several existing\npolicies is analyzed, and new fundamental limitations on risk-averse learning\nis established. In particular, it is shown that although a logarithmic\ndistribution-dependent regret in time $T$ is achievable (similar to the\nrisk-neutral problem), the worst-case (i.e. minimax) regret is lower bounded by\n$\\Omega(T)$ (in contrast to the $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ lower bound in the\nrisk-neutral problem). This sharp difference from the risk-neutral counterpart\nis caused by the the variance in the player's decisions, which, while absent in\nthe regret under the expected reward criterion, contributes to excess\nmean-variance due to the non-linearity of this risk measure. The role of the\ndecision variance in regret performance reflects a risk-averse player's desire\nfor robust decisions and outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 13:20:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

We investigate small-amplitude light variations in FU Ori occurring\nin timescales of days and weeks.\n  Aims. We seek to determine the mechanisms that lead to these light changes.\n  Methods. The visual light curve of FU Ori gathered by the MOST satellite\ncontinuously for 55 days in the 2013-2014 winter season and simultaneously\nobtained ground-based multi-colour data were compared with the results from a\ndisc and star light synthesis model.\n  Results. Hotspots on the star are not responsible for the majority of\nobserved light variations. Instead, we found that the long periodic family of\n10.5-11.4 d (presumably) quasi-periods showing light variations up to 0.07 mag\nmay arise owing to the rotational revolution of disc inhomogeneities located\nbetween 16-20 solar radii. The same distance is obtained by assuming that these\nlight variations arise because of a purely Keplerian revolution of these\ninhomogeneities for a stellar mass of 0.7 solar mass. The short-periodic\n(3-1.38 d) small amplitude (0.01 mag) light variations show a clear sign of\nperiod shortening, similar to what was discovered in the first MOST\nobservations of FU Ori. Our data indicate that these short-periodic\noscillations may arise because of changing visibility of plasma tongues (not\nincluded in our model), revolving in the magnetospheric gap and/or likely\nrelated hotspots as well.\n  Conclusions. Results obtained for the long-periodic 10-11 d family of light\nvariations appear to be roughly in line with the colour-period relation, which\nassumes that longer periods are produced by more external and cooler parts of\nthe disc. Coordinated observations in a broad spectral range are still\nnecessary to fully understand the nature of the short-periodic 1-3 d family of\nlight variations and their period changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 14:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

It is shown that in the Raman spectrum two\nprominent peaks, A 1g and E g , exhibit phonon hardening with increasing number\nof layers due to the inter-layer van der Waals interaction. Moreover, the Raman\nactivity of the A 1g mode significantly increases with increasing number of\nlayers due to the enhanced out-of-plane dielectric constant in the few-layer\ncase. We further characterize rigid-layer vibrations of low-frequency\ninter-layer shear (C) and breathing (LB) modes in few-layer PbI 2 . A reduced\nmono-atomic (linear) chain model (LCM) provides a fairly accurate picture of\nthe number of layers dependence of the low-frequency modes and it is shown also\nto be a powerful tool to study the inter-layer coupling strength in layered PbI\n2 .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 14:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Under\nempirical positivity violations, propensity score weights are highly variable,\nand doubly robust estimators suffer from high variance and large finite sample\nbias. To solve this problem, we introduce the $e$-score, which is defined\nthrough a dimension reduction for the propensity score.

The g-matrix formalism applies to a wide\nvariety of electron and hole qubits, and we focus on a hole qubit in a\nsilicon-on-insulator nanowire as an illustration. We show that the Rabi\nfrequency of this qubit shows a complex dependence on the orientation of the\nmagnetic field, and on the gate voltages that control the symmetry of the hole\nwave functions. We point out that the qubit may be advantageously switched\nbetween two bias points, one where it can be manipulated efficiently, and one\nwhere it is largely decoupled from the gate field but presumably longer lived.\nWe also discuss the role of residual strains in such devices in relation to\nrecent experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 15:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 21:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

As\nwith sets, the quasi-Assouad dimension of a measure is dominated by its Assouad\ndimension.

The most suitable detectors for this type of measurement are low\ntemperature thermal detectors, where all the energy released into an absorber\nis converted into a temperature increase that can be measured by a sensitive\nthermometer directly coupled with the absorber. This measurement was originally\nproposed in 1982 by A. De Rujula and M. Lusignoli, but only in the last decade\nthe technological progress in detectors development has allowed to design a\nsensitive experiment. HOLMES plans to deploy a large array of low temperature\nmicrocalorimeters with implanted $^{163}$Ho nuclei. In this contribution we\noutline the HOLMES project with its physics reach and technical challenges,\nalong with its status and perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 14:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

This study proposes a\nlocalization method that can avoid the occurrence of flip ambiguities in\nbounded distance measurement errors and constrained flying motions; to\ndemonstrate its efficacy, the method is implemented on bilateration and\ntrilateration. For bilateration, an improved bi-boundary model based on the\nunit disk graph model is created to compensate for the shortage of distance\nconstraints, and two boundaries are estimated as the communication range\nconstraint. The characteristic of the intersections of the communication range\nand distance constraints is studied to present a unique localization criterion\nwhich can avoid the occurrence of flip ambiguities.

Torsional oscillations\nare speed-up and slow-down bands of the azimuthal flow that correlate with the\nsolar cycle, and they imply the existence of a symmetric solar dynamo with a\nmeasured polar flux of 3x10^14 Wb.
