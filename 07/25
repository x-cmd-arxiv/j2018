In this paper, we introduce Self-Paced Learning\nwith Adaptive Deep Visual Embeddings (SPL-ADVisE), a novel end-to-end training\nprotocol that unites self-paced learning (SPL) and deep metric learning (DML).\nWe leverage the Magnet Loss to train an embedding convolutional neural network\n(CNN) to learn a salient representation space.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of SPL-ADVisE, we use deep\nCNN architectures for the task of supervised image classification on several\ncoarse- and fine-grained visual recognition datasets. Results show that, across\nall datasets, the proposed method converges faster and reaches a higher final\naccuracy than other SPL variants, particularly on fine-grained classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 16:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Compared with traditional outcome prediction, MFOP is a\nmore generalized problem. To handle this novel problem, based on the recent\nproposed radiomics, we propose a new unified framework termed as multifaceted\nradiomics (M-radiomics). M-radiomics trains multiple modality-specific\nclassifiers first and then optimally combines the output from the outputs of\ndifferent classifiers which are trained according to multiple different\ncriteria such as sensitivity and specificity. It considers multi-modality,\nmulti-classifier and multi-criteria into a unified framework, which makes the\nprediction more accurate.

Two clinical problems for\npredicting distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence in head & neck cancer\nwere investigated to validate the performance and reliability of the proposed\nM-radiomics.

Despite the enormous\nsuccess of approximate methods, tackling this problem exactly with conventional\ncomputers is still a formidable task. This has triggered several theoretical\nand experimental efforts to use quantum computers to solve chemistry problems,\nwith first proof-of-principle realizations done in a digital manner. An\nappealing alternative to the digital approach is analog quantum simulation,\nwhich does not require a scalable quantum computer, and has already been\nsuccessfully applied in condensed matter physics problems. However, all\navailable or planned setups cannot be used in quantum chemistry problems, since\nit is not known how to engineer the required Coulomb interactions with them.\nHere, we present a new approach to the simulation of quantum chemistry problems\nin an analog way. Our method relies on the careful combination of two\ntechnologies: ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices and cavity QED.

In such\nsettings it is well known that shrinkage estimators outperform maximum\nlikelihood estimators.

In\nexperiments, our model performs well on synthetic data, such as 2D shapes and\nanimated game sprites, and on real-world video frames. We present analyses of\nthe learned network representations, showing it is implicitly learning a\ncompact encoding of object appearance and motion. We also demonstrate a few of\nits applications, including visual analogy-making and video extrapolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 17:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 19:17:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 23:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

The morphology of these \"TeV halos\" requires\ncosmic-ray diffusion to be locally suppressed by a factor of ~100-1000 compared\nto the typical interstellar medium. No model currently explains this\nsuppression. We show that cosmic-ray self-confinement can significantly inhibit\ndiffusion near pulsars. The steep cosmic-ray gradient generates Alfven waves\nthat resonantly scatter the same cosmic-ray population, suppressing diffusion\nwithin ~20 pc of pulsars younger than ~100 kyr. In this model, TeV halos evolve\nthrough two phases, a growth phase where Alfven waves are resonantly generated\nand cosmic-ray diffusion becomes increasingly suppressed, and a subsequent\nrelaxation phase where the diffusion coefficient returns to the standard\ninterstellar value. Intriguingly, cosmic-rays are not strongly confined early\nin the TeV halo evolution, allowing a significant fraction of injected e+e- to\nescape. If these e+e- also escape from the surrounding supernova remnant, they\nwould provide a natural explanation for the positron excess observed by PAMELA\nand AMS-02. Recently created TeV cosmic-rays are confined in the TeV halo,\nmatching observations by HAWC and H.E.S.S. While our default model relaxes too\nrapidly to explain the confinement of TeV cosmic rays around mature pulsars,\nsuch as Geminga, models utilizing a Kraichnan turbulence spectrum experience\nmuch slower relaxation. Thus, observations of TeV halos around mature pulsars\nmay provide a probe into our understanding of interstellar turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 13:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

A statistical analysis of all nebulae with measured recombination\nline abundances reveals no link between central star surface chemistry and\nnebular abundance discrepancy, but a clear link between binarity and the\nabundance discrepancy, as well as an anticorrelation between abundance\ndiscrepancies and nebular electron densities: all nebulae with a binary central\nstar with a period of less than 1.15 days have an abundance discrepancy factor\nexceeding 10, and an electron density less than $\\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$; those\nwith longer period binaries have abundance discrepancy factors less than 10 and\nmuch higher electron densities.

The key idea is to train the model to output high uncertainty for\ndata points outside of the training distribution. NCPs do so using an input\nprior, which adds noise to the inputs of the current mini batch, and an output\nprior, which is a wide distribution given these inputs. NCPs are compatible\nwith any model that can output uncertainty estimates, are easy to scale, and\nyield reliable uncertainty estimates throughout training.

Several recent works at PODS'18 proposed such algorithms but\nwith linear delay in the document size or with an exponential dependency in\nsize of the (generally nondeterministic) input VA. In particular, Florenzano et\nal. suggest that our desired runtime guarantees cannot be met for general\nsequential VAs. We refute this and show that, given a nondeterministic\nsequential VA and an input document, we can enumerate the mappings of the VA on\nthe document with the following bounds: the preprocessing is linear in the\ndocument size and polynomial in the size of the VA, and the delay is\nindependent of the document and polynomial in the size of the VA.

A crucial step is to use natural,\nlow-weight operations with an ancilla to extract information about errors\nwithout causing backaction on the encoded system. Essentially, ancilla errors\nmust not propagate to the encoded system and induce errors beyond those which\ncan be corrected. The current schemes for achieving this fault-tolerance to\nancilla errors come at the cost of increased overhead requirements. An\nefficient way to extract error syndromes in a fault-tolerant manner is by using\na single ancilla with strongly biased noise channel. Typically, however,\nrequired elementary operations can become challenging when the noise is\nextremely biased. We propose to overcome this shortcoming by using a\nbosonic-cat ancilla in a parametrically driven nonlinear cavity.

To highlight the flexibility of this approach, we illustrate the\nsyndrome extraction process in a variety of codes such as qubit-based toric\ncodes, bosonic cat- and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes.

Understanding the point spread function (PSF) for LSST is\na crucial step to accurate measurements of weak gravitational lensing.\nAtmospheric contributions dominate the LSST PSF. Simulations of Kolmogorov\nturbulence models are commonly used to characterize and correct for these\natmospheric effects. In order to validate these simulations, we compare the\npredicted atmospheric behavior to empirical data.

Since the\npublication of this result in 2004 there has been a persistent tension of 3.5\nstandard deviations with the theoretical prediction of a_mu based on the\nStandard Model. The uncertainty of the latter is dominated by the effects of\nthe strong interaction, notably the hadronic vacuum polarisation (HVP) and the\nhadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering contributions, which are commonly\nevaluated using a data-driven approach and hadronic models, respectively. Given\nthat the discrepancy between theory and experiment is currently one of the most\nintriguing hints for a possible failure of the Standard Model, it is of\nparamount importance to determine both the HVP and HLbL contributions from\nfirst principles. In this review we present the status of lattice QCD\ncalculations of the leading-order HVP and the HLbL scattering contributions,\na_mu^hvp and a_mu^hlbl. After describing the formalism to express a_mu^hvp and\na_mu^hlbl in terms of Euclidean correlation functions that can be computed on\nthe lattice, we focus on the systematic effects that must be controlled to\nachieve a first-principles determination of the dominant strong interaction\ncontributions to a_mu with the desired level of precision. We also present an\noverview of current lattice QCD results for a_mu^hvp and a_mu^hlbl, as well as\nrelated quantities such as the transition form factor for pi0 -> gamma*gamma*.\nWhile the total error of current lattice QCD estimates of a_mu^hvp has reached\nthe few-percent level, it must be further reduced by a factor 5 to be\ncompetitive with the data-driven dispersive approach.

In this paper, we propose\nto use such perturbations within a novel contrastive learning setup to build\nnegative samples, which are then used to produce improved video\nrepresentations. To this end, given a well-trained deep model for per-frame\nvideo recognition, we first generate adversarial noise adapted to this model.\nPositive and negative bags are produced using the original data features from\nthe full video sequence and their perturbed counterparts, respectively. Unlike\nthe classic contrastive learning methods, we develop a binary classification\nproblem that learns a set of discriminative hyperplanes -- as a subspace --\nthat will separate the two bags from each other. This subspace is then used as\na descriptor for the video, dubbed \\emph{discriminative subspace pooling}.

Methods: An exhaustive analysis was\ncarried out in order to obtain an optimized mPSD design that maximize the\nscintillation light collection produced by the interaction of ionizing photons.\nSeveral mPSD prototypes were built and tested in order to determine the\nappropriate order of scintillators relative to the photodetector, as well as\ntheir length as a function of the scintillation light emitted.

Global\noptimization has recently been investigated to provide stable and unique\nsolutions, but the computational cost of the algorithms is prohibitively high\nfor most image data with reasonable sizes.

In this paper, we study the impact of radio\nsources and cosmic infrared background (CIB) on observed tSZ-lensing\ncorrelation. Assuming the best-fit model of CIB by the Planck satellite, we\nestimate that the residual correlation of CIB with large-scale structures will\nbe of an order of $2\\%$ of expected tSZ-lensing correlation from intracluster\nmedium in current lensing surveys. On the other hand, despite large model\nuncertainties, we find that correlation of lensing and radio sources can induce\na negative correction for the observed tSZ-lensing correlation with a\n$\\sim10-30\\%$ level.

In particular,\nsensing of Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, a widely\naccepted multi-carrier transmission paradigm, has received paramount interest.\nDespite various efforts, most conventional OFDM sensing methods suffer from\nnoise uncertainty, timing delay and carrier frequency offset (CFO) that\nsignificantly degrade the sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, this\nwork develops two novel OFDM sensing frameworks drawing support from deep\nlearning networks. Specifically, we first propose a stacked autoencoder based\nspectrum sensing method (SAE-SS), in which a stacked autoencoder network is\ndesigned to extract the inherent features of OFDM signals. Using these features\nto classify the OFDM user's activities, SAE-SS is much more robust to noise\nuncertainty, timing delay, and CFO than the conventional OFDM sensing methods.\nMoreover, SAE-SS doesn't require any prior information of signals (e.g., signal\nstructure, pilot tones, cyclic prefix) which are essential for the conventional\nfeature-based OFDM sensing methods. To further improve the sensing accuracy of\nSAE-SS, especially under low SNR conditions, we propose a stacked autoencoder\nbased spectrum sensing method using time-frequency domain signals (SAE-TF).\nSAE-TF achieves higher sensing accuracy than SAW-SS at the cost of higher\ncomputational complexity. Extensive simulation results show that both SAE-SS\nand SAE-TF can achieve significantly higher sensing accuracy, compared with\nstate of the art approaches that suffer from noise uncertainty, timing delay\nand CFO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 01:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 22:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 00:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 13:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

The dynamic stability of a\npower grid is usually quantified by the probability of its nodes' recovery to\nphase synchronization of the alternating current it carries, in response to\nexternal perturbation. Intuitively, the stability of nodes in power grids is\nsupposed to become more robust as the coupling strength between the nodes\nincreases. However, we find a counterintuitive range of coupling strength\nvalues where the synchronization stability suddenly droops as the coupling\nstrength increases, on a number of simple graph structures. Since power grids\nare designed to fulfill both local and long-range power demands, such simple\ngraph structures or graphlets for local power transmission are indeed relevant\nin reality. We show that the observed nonmonotonic behavior is a consequence of\ntransitions in multistability, which are related to changes in stability of the\n\\emph{unsynchronized} states. Therefore, our findings suggest that a\ncomprehensive understanding of changes in multistability are necessary to\nprevent the unexpected catastrophic instability in the building blocks of power\ngrids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 02:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Main memory bandwidth is especially taxing\nbattery-operated devices such as smartphones. Tile-Based Rendering GPUs divide\nthe screen space into multiple tiles that are independently rendered in on-chip\nbuffers, thus reducing memory bandwidth and energy consumption. We have\nobserved that, in many animated graphics workloads, a large number of screen\ntiles have the same color across adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose\nRendering Elimination (RE), a novel micro-architectural technique that\naccurately determines if a tile will be identical to the same tile in the\npreceding frame before rasterization by means of comparing signatures. Since RE\nidentifies redundant tiles early in the graphics pipeline, it completely avoids\nthe computation and memory accesses of the most power consuming stages of the\npipeline, which substantially reduces the execution time and the energy\nconsumption of the GPU. For widely used Android applications, we show that RE\nachieves an average speedup of 1.74x and energy reduction of 43% for the\nGPU/Memory system, surpassing by far the benefits of Transaction Elimination, a\nstate-of-the-art memory bandwidth reduction technique available in some\ncommercial Tile-Based Rendering GPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 06:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

RESULTS: The instrument configuration\ntested here enables: measurement of major elements and organic molecules with\nultrahigh mass resolution (m/{\\Delta}m higher than 120,000, FWHM);\nquantification of isotopic abundances with 1.0% (2{\\sigma}) precision; and,\nidentification of highly accurate masses within 3.2 ppm of absolute values.

Existing CSI-based\nauthentication algorithms mostly require a deep knowledge of the channel to\ndeliver decent performance. In this paper, we investigate CSI-based\nauthenticators that can spare the effort to predetermine channel properties by\nutilizing deep neural networks (DNNs). We first propose a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN)-enabled authenticator that is able to extract the local features\nin CSI. Next, we employ the recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the\ndependencies between different frequencies in CSI. In addition, we propose to\nuse the convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN)---a combination of the\nCNN and the RNN---to learn local and contextual information in CSI for user\nauthentication. To effectively train these DNNs, one needs a large amount of\nlabeled channel records. However, it is often expensive to label large channel\nobservations in the presence of a spoofer. In view of this, we further study a\ncase in which only a small part of the the channel observations are labeled. To\nhandle it, we extend these DNNs-enabled approaches into semi-supervised ones.\nThis extension is based on a semi-supervised learning technique that employs\nboth the labeled and unlabeled data to train a DNN. To be specific, our\nsemi-supervised method begins by generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled\nchannel samples through implementing the K-means algorithm in a semi-supervised\nmanner. Subsequently, both the labeled and pseudo labeled data are exploited to\npre-train a DNN, which is then fine-tuned based on the labeled channel records.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 08:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

Here, we show that such a relationship arises\nnaturally from a model in which T cell expansion is limited by decaying levels\nof presented antigen. The same model also accounts for the observed dependence\nof T cell expansion on affinity for antigen and on the kinetics of antigen\nadministration. Extending the model to address expansion of multiple T cell\nclones competing for antigen, we find that higher affinity clones can suppress\nthe proliferation of lower affinity clones, thereby promoting the specificity\nof the response.

In the case of the $3+1$\ndimensional self-similar flow, we arrive at a family of solutions, that are\nrelated through a differential equation arising from the corresponding Euler\nequation. To find the magnetic field evolution from the Gubser flow, we solve\nthe MHD equations of a stationary fluid in a conformally flat $dS^{3}\\times\nE^{1}$ spacetime. The results are then Weyl transformed back into the Minkowski\nspacetime. In this case, the temporal evolution of the resulting magnetic field\nis shown to exhibit a transition between an early time $1/t$ decay to a\n$1/t^{3}$ decay at a late time. Here, $t$ is the time coordinate. Transverse\nand longitudinal components of the magnetic fields arising from these flows are\nalso found. The latter turns out to be sensitive to the transverse size of the\nfluid. In contrast to the result arising from the Gubser flow, the radial\ndomain of validity of the magnetic field arising from the self-similar flow is\nhighly restricted. A comparison of the results suggests that the (conformal)\nGubser MHD may give a more appropriate qualitative picture of the magnetic\nfield decay in the plasma of quarks and gluons created in heavy ion collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 08:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

This gradual heating represents the energy output from\nprocesses such as winds from massive stars or feedback from High Mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs), contrasting the impulsive energy injection from supernovae\n(SNe). For stars with a mass high enough that their lifetime is shorter than\nthe life of the cloud, we include a SN feedback prescription. Including both\neffects, we investigate the interplay between slow and fast forms of feedback\nand their effectiveness at triggering/suppressing star formation. We find that\nSN feedback can carve low density chimneys in the gas, offering a path of least\nresistance for the energy to escape. Once this occurs the more stable, but less\nenergetic, gradual feedback is able to keep the chimneys open. By funneling the\nhot destructive gas away from the centre of the cloud, chimneys can have a\npositive effect on both the efficiency and duration of star formation.\nMoreover, the critical factor is the number of high mass stars and SNe (and any\nsubsequent HMXBs) active within the free-fall time of each cloud. This can vary\nfrom cloud to cloud due to the stochasticity of SN delay times and in HMXB\nformation. However, the defining factor in our simulations is the efficiency of\nthe cooling, which can alter the Jeans mass required for sink particle\nformation, along with the number of massive stars in the cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 08:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

In dense molecular clouds, it is also present in the\nsolid-phase as a constituent of the mixed water-dominated ices covering dust\ngrains.

In experimental observations of solid CO/water mixed samples, its IR\nfrequency splits into two components, giving rise to a blue- and a redshifted\nband. However, in astronomical observations, the former has never been\nobserved. Several attempts have been carried out to explain this peculiar\nbehaviour, but the question still remains open. In this work, we resorted to\npure quantum mechanical simulations in order to shed some light on this\nproblem.

While typical\nrandom walks on networks consist of standard Markov chains whose static\ntransition probabilities dictate the flow of random walkers through the\nnetwork, nonlinear random walks consist of nonlinear Markov chains whose\ntransition probabilities change in time depending on the current state of the\nsystem. This framework allows us to model more complex flows through networks\nthat may depend on the current system state. For instance, under humanitarian\nor capitalistic direction, resource flow between institutions may be diverted\npreferentially to poorer or wealthier institutions, respectively. Importantly,\nthe nonlinearity in this framework gives rise to richer dynamical behavior than\noccurs in linear random walks. Here we study these dynamics that arise in\nweakly and strongly nonlinear regimes in a family of nonlinear random walks\nwhere random walkers are biased either towards (positive bias) or away from\n(negative bias) nodes that currently have more random walkers. In the weakly\nnonlinear regime we prove the existence and uniqueness of a stable stationary\nstate fixed point provided that the network structure is primitive that is\nanalogous to the stationary distribution of a typical (linear) random walk.

Two approaches usually\nreferred to as pulse-shaping and active interference cancellation (AIC) are\nclassically employed to reduce the out-of-band emission (OOBE) without\naffecting the receiver. This paper proposes a spectral shaping method that\ngeneralizes and unifies these two strategies. To this end, the OFDM carriers\nare shaped with novel pulses, referred to as generalized pulses, that consist\nof the ones used in conventional OFDM systems plus a series of cancellation\nterms aimed at reducing the OOBE of the former. Hence, each generalized pulse\nembeds all the terms required to reduce its spectrum in the desired bands.

MQT can be\nachieved in two ways: (i) Any quantum trajectories can be monitored by directly\nmonitoring the environment, which is experimentally challenging for realistic\nnoises; (ii) Certain quantum trajectories can also be monitored by frequently\nmeasuring the quantum probe alone via ancilla-assisted encoding and error\ndetection. This establishes an interesting connection between MQT and the full\nquantum error correction protocol. Application of MQT to estimate the level\nsplitting and decoherence rate of a spin-1/2 under typical decoherence channels\ndemonstrate that it can avoid the long-time exponential loss of the estimation\nprecision and, in special cases, recover the Heisenberg scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 12:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 14:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Considering steering tests with two\nnoisy measurements, our inequalities exactly recover the noise threshold for\nsteerability. This is the case for any pair of qubit 2-outcome measurements, as\nwell as for pairs of mutually unbiased bases in any dimension. This shows that\neasy-to-evaluate quantities such as entropy can optimally witness steering,\ndespite the fact that they are coarse-grained representations of the underlying\nstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 13:46:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 11:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

We present the discovery of a periodic\nRV signal compatible with the presence of a planet candidate in the 1.15 Gyr\nopen cluster IC4651 orbiting the 2.06 M$_\\odot$ star No. 9122. If confirmed,\nthe planet candidate would have a minimum mass of 7.2 M$_{J}$ and a period of\n747 days. However, we also find that the FWHM of the CCF varies with a period\nclose to the RV, casting doubts on the planetary nature of the signal. We also\nprovide refined parameters for the previously discovered planet around NGC2423\nNo. 3 but show evidence that the BIS of the CCF is correlated with the RV\nduring some of the observing periods. This fact advises us that this might not\nbe a real planet and that the RV variations could be caused by stellar activity\nand/or pulsations. Finally, we show that the previously reported signal by a\nbrown dwarf around NGC4349 No. 127 is presumably produced by stellar activity\nmodulation. The long-term monitoring of several red giants in open clusters has\nallowed us to find periodic RV variations in several stars.

This work warns that\nalthough it is possible to detect planets around red giants, large-amplitude,\nlong-period RV modulations do exist in such stars that can mimic the presence\nof an orbiting planetary body.

The most used imaging technique to help in its\ndiagnosis and follow-up is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fluid Attenuated\nInversion Recovery (FLAIR) images are usually acquired in the context of MS\nbecause lesions often appear hyperintense in this particular image weight,\nmaking it easier for physicians to identify them. Though lesions have a bright\nintensity profile, it may overlap with white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM)\ntissues, posing difficulties to be accurately segmented. In this sense, we\npropose a lesion enhancement technique to dim down WM and GM regions and\nhighlight hyperintensities, making them much more distinguishable than other\ntissues. We applied our technique to the ISBI 2015 MS Lesion Segmentation\nChallenge and took the average gray level intensity of MS lesions, WM and GM on\nFLAIR and enhanced images. The lesion intensity profile in FLAIR was on average\n25% and 19% brighter than white matter and gray matter, respectively;\ncomparatively, the same profile in our enhanced images was on average 444% and\n264% brighter. Such results mean a significant improvement on the intensity\ndistinction among these three clusters, which may come as aid both for experts\nand automated techniques. Moreover, a byproduct of our proposal is that the\nenhancement can be used to automatically estimate a mask encompassing WM and MS\nlesions, which may be useful for brain tissue volume assessment and improve MS\nlesion segmentation accuracy in future works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 14:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

Importantly, our results imply that it is\npossible to infer the degree distribution of a network only from individual\ndynamical measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 14:28:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 12:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

With the aim of obtaining a more\ncomplete view of the incidence of magnetic fields in degenerate stars, we have\nstarted a long-term campaign of high-precision spectropolarimetric observations\nof white dwarfs. Here we report the results obtained so far with the\nlow-resolution FORS2 instrument of the ESO VLT and the medium-resolution ISIS\ninstrument of the WHT. We have considered a sample of 48 stars, of which five\nare known magnetic or suspected magnetic stars, and obtained new longitudinal\nmagnetic field measurements with a mean uncertainty of about 0.6 kG. Overall,\nin the course of our survey (the results of which have been partially published\nin papers devoted to individual stars) we have discovered one new weak-field\nmagnetic white dwarf, confirmed the magnetic nature of another, found that a\nsuspected magnetic star is not magnetic, and suggested two new candidate\nmagnetic white dwarfs. Even combined with data previously obtained in the\nliterature, our sample is not sufficient yet to reach any final conclusions\nabout the actual incidence of very weak magnetic fields in white dwarfs, but we\nhave set the basis to achieve a homogeneous survey of an unbiased sample of\nwhite dwarfs. As a by-product, our survey has also enabled us to carry out a\ndetailed characterisation of the ISIS and the FORS2 instruments for the\ndetection of extremely weak magnetic fields in white dwarfs, and in particular\nto relate the S/N to measurement uncertainty for white dwarfs of different\nspectral types. This study will help the optimisation of future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 14:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

The asynchronous\nDBFAs and SBFAs incorporate redundant logic and are encoded using the\ndelay-insensitive dual-rail code (i.e. homogeneous data encoding) and follow a\n4-phase return-to-zero handshaking. Compared to the previous asynchronous RCAs\ninvolving DBFAs and SBFAs, which are based on homogeneous or heterogeneous\ndelay-insensitive data encodings and which correspond to different timing\nmodels, the early output asynchronous RCA incorporating the proposed DBFAs\nand/or SBFAs is found to result in reduced area for the dual-operand addition\noperation and feature significantly less latency than the asynchronous RCAs\nwhich consist of only SBFAs.

The relative risk of skewness and fault-location on the bridges is\nevaluated by developing fragility curves of bridge components and system\naccounting for the material, geometric, and structural uncertainties. It is\nnoted that the skewness and bridge site close to active faults make bridges\nmore vulnerable, and the existing modification factor in HAZUS cannot capture\nthe variation in the median value of the fragilities appropriately. A new set\nof fragility adjustment factors for skewness coupled with the effect of fault\nlocation is suggested in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 01:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}
