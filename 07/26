Taking advantage of the integrable structures emergent in\nthe theory, non-local observables such as null polygonal Wilson loops are\nstudied in $4d$ planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills. Their duality with the\n$4d$ gluon scattering amplitudes makes the analysis even more interesting. The\nso-called \\emph{Pentagon approach}, an application of the Operator Product\nExpansion (OPE) method to the null polygonal Wilsol loops, makes possible a\nnon-perturbative evaluation of these objects. They are recast as an OPE series\nover the $2d$ GKP flux-tube excitations, a description reminescent of the QCD\nflux-tube stretching between quarks. The integrability of the flux-tube allows\nus to evaluate the series, in principle, for any value of the coupling\nconstant. From this analysis, several results have been obtained. In the strong\ncoupling regime we reproduced the TBA-like equations expected from the minimal\narea problem in string theory, finding agreement with the $AdS/CFT$ prediction.\nIn this respect, of fundamental importance is the emergence of effective bound\nstates between elementary fermionic excitations.

Assuming sparse priority over\nthe signal of interest, recent algorithms have been developed to solve the\nphase retrieval problem. Some examples include SparseAltMinPhase (SAMP), Sparse\nWirtinger flow (SWF) and Sparse Truncated Amplitude flow (SPARTA). However, the\noptimization cost functions of the mentioned algorithms are non-convex and\nnon-smooth. In order to fix the non-smoothness of the cost function, the SPARTA\nmethod uses truncation thresholds to calculate a truncated step update\ndirection. In practice, the truncation procedure requires calculating more\nparameters to obtain a desired performance in the phase recovery. Therefore,\nthis paper proposes an algorithm called SPRSF (Sparse Phase retrieval via\nSmoothing Function) to solve the sparse PR problem by introducing a smoothing\nfunction. SPRSF is an iterative algorithm where the update step is obtained by\na hard thresholding over a gradient descent direction. Theoretical analyses\nshow that the smoothing function uniformly approximates the non-convex and\nnon-smooth sparse PR optimization problem. Moreover, SPRSF does not require the\ntruncation procedure used in SPARTA. Numerical tests demonstrate that SPRSF\nperforms better than state-of-the-art methods, especially when there is no\nknowledge about the sparsity $k$. In particular, SPRSF attains a higher mean\nrecovery rate in comparison with SPARTA, SAMP and SWF methods, when the\nsparsity varies for the real and complex cases. Further, in terms of the\nsampling complexity, the SPRSF method outperforms its competitive alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 16:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

The channel is modeled as a channel with Markovian state\nwhere the packet drop probability depends on the channel state and the transmit\npower. A receiver observes the channel output and the channel state and\nestimates the source realization. The receiver also feeds back the channel\nstate and an acknowledgment for successful reception to the transmitter. We\nconsider two models for the source---finite state Markov chains and first-order\nautoregressive processes. For the first model, using ideas from team theory, we\nestablish the structure of optimal transmission and estimation strategies and\nidentify a dynamic program to determine optimal strategies with that structure.\nFor the second model, we assume that the noise process has unimodal and\nsymmetric distribution. Using ideas from majorization theory, we show that the\noptimal transmission strategy is symmetric and monotonic and the optimal\nestimation strategy is like Kalman filter. Consequently, when there are a\nfinite number of power levels, the optimal transmission strategy may be\ndescribed using thresholds that depend on the channel state. Finally, we\npropose a simulation based approach (Renewal Monte Carlo) to compute the\noptimal thresholds and optimal performance and elucidate the algorithm with an\nexample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 16:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

We show that the new system of equations relates the quadratic first\nintegrals of the holonomic system with the geometric collineations of the\nkinetic metric and in particular with the Killing tensors of order two. We\nconsider briefly various results concerning the Killing tensors of second-order\nand prove a general formula which gives in the case of a flat kinetic metric\nthe generic Killing tensor in terms of the vectors of the special projective\nalgebra of the kinetic metric. This establishes the connection between the\ngeometry defined by the kinetic metric and the quadratic first integrals of the\noriginal system of differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 16:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

However, the wireless channel around the human body poses unique\nchallenges such as a high and variable path-loss caused by frequent changes in\nthe relative node positions as well as the surrounding environment. An adaptive\nwireless body area network (WBAN) scheme is presented that reconfigures the\nnetwork by learning from body kinematics and biosignals. It has very low\noverhead since these signals are already captured by the WBAN sensor nodes to\nsupport their basic functionality. Periodic channel fluctuations in activities\nlike walking can be exploited by reusing accelerometer data and scheduling\npacket transmissions at optimal times. Network states can be predicted based on\nchanges in observed biosignals to reconfigure the network parameters in real\ntime. A realistic body channel emulator that evaluates the path-loss for\neveryday human activities was developed to assess the efficacy of the proposed\ntechniques. Simulation results show up to 41% improvement in packet delivery\nratio (PDR) and up to 27% reduction in power consumption by intelligent\nscheduling at lower transmission power levels. Moreover, experimental results\non a custom test-bed demonstrate an average PDR increase of 20% and 18% when\nusing our adaptive EMG- and heart-rate-based transmission power control\nmethods, respectively.

However, there is still a lack of intuitive and accessible\ntools that help social media users distinguish misinformation from verified\nnews. In this paper, we present Verifi2, a visual analytic system that uses\nstate-of-the-art computational methods to highlight salient features from text,\nsocial network, and images. By exploring news on a source level through\nmultiple coordinated views in Verifi2, users can interact with the complex\ndimensions that characterize misinformation and contrast how real and\nsuspicious news outlets differ on these dimensions. To evaluate Verifi2, we\nconduct interviews with experts in digital media, journalism, education,\npsychology, and computing who study misinformation. Our interviews show\npromising potential for Verifi2 to serve as an educational tool on\nmisinformation. Furthermore, our interview results highlight the complexity of\nthe problem of combating misinformation and call for more work from the\nvisualization community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 17:36:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 18:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Towards this, we contrived PADME (Protein And\nDrug Molecule interaction prEdiction), a framework based on Deep Neural\nNetworks, to predict real-valued interaction strength between compounds and\nproteins without requiring feature engineering. PADME takes both compound and\nprotein information as inputs, so it is capable of solving cold-target (and\ncold-drug) problems. To our knowledge, we are the first to combine Molecular\nGraph Convolution (MGC) for compound featurization with protein descriptors for\nDTI prediction.

We address this problem by constructing a\nsample of more than 80,000 colour-selected AGN from redshift z=0 to 7.5. While\nthis sample is composed of multiple data sets with spectroscopic redshifts and\ncompleteness estimates, we homogenise these data sets to identical cosmologies,\nintrinsic AGN spectra, and magnitude systems.

This localization can be understood as a consequence of the\nreturn properties of low dimensional random walks, through a mechanism\nreminiscent of weak localization, but insensitive to dephasing. The charge\ndynamics is well-described by a system of coupled hydrodynamic equations, which\nmakes several nontrivial predictions in good agreement with numerics.\nImportantly, these equations also predict localization in 2d fractonic\ncircuits. Immobile fractonic charge emits non-conserved operators, whose\nspreading is governed by exponents distinct to non-fractonic circuits.\nFractonic operators exhibit a short time linear growth of observable\nentanglement with saturation to an area law, as well as a subthermal volume law\nfor operator entanglement.

The profile shapes are a more sensitive measure of the\nbinary orbital separation and the degree of alignment of the black hole\nmini-disks, and are less sensitive to the SBHB mass ratio and orbital\neccentricity.

Here,\nwe develop the Keldysh non-linear sigma model technique to calculate these\ncorrelators in interacting disordered metals. In particular, we focus on the\nregularized and unregularized OTOCs, defined as $Tr[\\sqrt{\\rho} A(t)\n\\sqrt{\\rho} A^\\dagger(t)]$ and $Tr[\\rho A(t)A^\\dagger(t)]$ respectively (where\n$A(t)$ is the anti-commutator of fermion field operators and $\\rho$ is the\nthermal density matrix). The calculation of the rate of OTOCs' exponential\ngrowth is reminiscent to that of the dephasing rate in interacting metals, but\nhere it involves two replicas of the system (two \"worlds\"). The intra-world\ncontributions reproduce the dephasing (that would correspond to a decay of the\ncorrelator), while the inter-world terms provide a term of the opposite sign\nthat exceeds dephasing. Consequently, both regularized and unregularized OTOCs\ngrow exponentially in time, but surprisingly we find that the corresponding\nmany-body Lyapunov exponents are different. For the regularized correlator, we\nreproduce an earlier perturbation theory result for the Lyapunov exponent that\nsatisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound. However, the Lyapunov exponent\nof the unregularized correlator parametrically exceeds the bound. We argue that\nthe latter is not a reliable indicator of many body quantum chaos as it\ncontains additional contributions from elastic scattering events due to virtual\nprocesses that should not contribute to many-body chaos. These results bring up\nan important general question of the physical meaning of the OTOCs often used\nin calculations and proofs.

The grooming is implemented using a soft-drop grooming algorithm and\nhelps us in mitigating the effects of Non-Global logarithms and pile up.

A global attractor is the minimal\nset that attracts all bounded sets; it contains all forward-time limit points.\nOur approach uses (generalised) Lyapunov functions to find attracting sets,\nwhich must contain the global attractor, and the choice of Lyapunov function is\noptimised based on the quantity whose extreme value one aims to bound. We also\npresent a non-global framework for bounding extrema over the minimal set that\nis attracting in a specified region of state space. If the dynamics are\ngoverned by ordinary differential equations, and the equations and quantities\nof interest are polynomial, then our methods can be implemented computationally\nusing polynomial optimisation. In particular, we enforce nonnegativity of\ncertain polynomial expressions by requiring them to be representable as sums of\nsquares, leading to a convex optimisation problem that can be recast as a\nsemidefinite program and solved computationally. This computer assistance lets\none construct complicated polynomial Lyapunov functions. Computations are\nillustrated using three examples. The first is the chaotic Lorenz system, where\nwe bound extreme values of various monomials of the coordinates over the global\nattractor. In the second example we bound extreme values in a nine-mode\ntruncation of fluid dynamics which displays long-lived chaotic transients. The\nthird example has two locally stable limit cycles, each with its own basin of\nattraction, and we apply our non-global framework to construct bounds for one\nbasin that do not apply to the other. For each example we compute Lyapunov\nfunctions of polynomial degrees up to at least eight. In cases where we can\njudge the sharpness of our bounds, they are sharp to at least three digits when\nthe polynomial degree is at least four or six.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 18:34:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 22:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 20:21:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 05:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

But some aspects have\nreceived little attention. First, most comparison studies treat prediction\nperformance and variable selection aspects separately. Second, methods are\neither compared within a binary outcome setting (based on an arbitrarily chosen\ndelay) or within a survival setting, but not both. In this paper, we propose a\ncomparison methodology to weight up those different settings both in terms of\nprediction and variables selection, while incorporating advanced machine\nlearning strategies. Methods: Using a high-dimensional case study on a\nsickle-cell disease (SCD) cohort, we compare 8 statistical methods. In the\nbinary outcome setting, we consider logistic regression (LR), support vector\nmachine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB) and neural network\n(NN); while on the survival analysis setting, we consider the Cox Proportional\nHazards (PH), the CURE and the C-mix models. We then compare performances of\nall methods both in terms of risk prediction and variable selection, with a\nfocus on the use of Elastic-Net regularization technique. Results: Among all\nassessed statistical methods assessed, the C-mix model yields the better\nperformances in both the two considered settings, as well as interesting\ninterpretation aspects. There is some consistency in selected covariates across\nmethods within a setting, but not much across the two settings. Conclusions: It\nappears that learning withing the survival setting first, and then going back\nto a binary prediction using the survival estimates significantly enhance\nbinary predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 18:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

Yet it has long been difficult to constrain this component in disks\nothers than the Milky Way. This article presents the modeling of the\nazimuthal-to-radial axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid of galactic disks from\nstellar dispersion maps using integral field spectroscopy data of the CALIFA\nsurvey. The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown to be not strongly dependent\non the assumed vertical-to-radial dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The\nanisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital structure of\ndisk galaxies from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits\nare isotropic in inner disk regions and become more radial as a function of\nradius, although this picture tends to depend on galaxy morphology and\nluminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured from the Second\nGaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies. A new\ncorrelation is evidenced, linking the absolute magnitude or stellar mass of the\ndisks to the azimuthal anisotropy. More luminous disks have more radial orbits\nand less luminous disks have isotropic and somewhat tangential orbits. This\ncorrelation is consistent with the picture in galaxy evolution in which orbits\nbecome more radial as the mass grows and is redistributed as a function of\ntime. With the help of circular velocity curves, it is also shown that the\nepicycle theory fails to reproduce the diversity of the azimuthal anisotropy of\nstellar random motions, as it predicts only nearly radial orbits in the\npresence of flat curves. The origin of this conflict is yet to be identified.\nIt also questions the validity of the vertical-to-radial axis ratio of the\nvelocity ellipsoid derived by many studies in the framework of the epicyclic\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 19:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 14:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

The rotation period\nbimodality, originally discovered by McQuillan et al.

The latter is inspired by the XFEM approach in the\nsense that cut-off functions are used, but it is simpler to implement since no\nenrichment by singular functions is provided. In that context, getting\nconvergence for the dual variables defined on the interface is non-trivial. For\nthat purpose, an augmented Lagrangian technique stabilizes the convergence of\nthe multipliers, which is important because their value would determine the\ndynamics of the interface in an unsteady framework. Theoretical analysis is\nprovided, where we show that a discrete inf-sup condition, independent of the\nmesh size, is satisfied for the stabilized formulation. This guarantees optimal\nconvergence rates, that we observe with numerical tests. The capacity of the\nmethod is demonstrated with robustness tests, and with an unsteady model tested\nfor deformations of the interface that correspond to ellipsoidal shapes in\ndimension 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 22:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 19:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Existing research on the task assignment with budget\nconstraint mostly focuses on static offline scenarios, where the spatiotemporal\ninformation of all workers and tasks is known in advance. However, workers\nusually appear dynamically on real spatial crowdsourcing platforms, where\nexisting solutions can hardly handle it. In this paper, we formally define a\nnovel problem Budget-aware Online task Assignment(BOA) in spatial crowdsourcing\napplications. BOA aims to maximize the number of assigned worker- task pairs\nunder a budget constraint where workers appear dynamically on platforms. To\naddress the BOA problem, we first propose an efficient threshold-based greedy\nalgorithm Greedy-RT which utilizes a random generated threshold to prune the\npairs with large travel cost. Greedy-RT performs well in adversary model when\ncompared with simple greedy algorithm, but it is unstable in random model for\nits randomly generated threshold may produce poor quality in matching size. We\nthen propose a revised algorithm Greedy-OT which could learn approximately\noptimal threshold from historical data, and consequently improves matching size\nsignificantly in both models.

To guarantee the number of bits mapped\nby the transmitter's index at each timeslot is an integer, the number of\ntransmitters (i.e., light-emitting diodes) in the SM based VLC system is often\nset be a power of two. To break the limitation on the required number of\ntransmitters and provide more design flexibility, this paper investigates the\nSM based VLC with an arbitrary number of transmitters. Initially, a channel\nadaptive bit mapping (CABM) scheme is proposed, which includes three steps: bit\nmapping in space domain, bit mapping in signal domain, and the channel adaptive\nmapping. The proposed CABM scheme allows operation with an arbitrary number of\ntransmitters, and is verified to be an efficient scheme through numerical\nresults. Based on the CABM scheme, the information-theoretical aspects of the\nSM based VLC are analyzed. The theoretical expression of the mutual information\nis first analyzed. However, it is very hard to evaluate system performance. To\nobtain more insights, a lower bound of the mutual information is derived, which\nis in closedform. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the\ngap between the mutual information and its lower bound is small. Finally, to\nfurther improve the system performance, the precoding scheme is proposed for\nthe SM based VLC. Numerical results show that the system performance improves\ndramatically when using the proposed precoding scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 02:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

Most self-expressive methods\nusually construct a feasible affinity matrix from a coefficient matrix,\nobtained by solving an optimization problem. However, the negative entries in\nthe coefficient matrix are forced to be positive when constructing the affinity\nmatrix via exponentiation, absolute symmetrization, or squaring operations.\nThis consequently damages the inherent correlations among the data. Besides,\nthe affine constraint used in these methods is not flexible enough for\npractical applications. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we introduce\na scaled simplex representation (SSR) for subspace clustering problem.\nSpecifically, the non-negative constraint is used to make the coefficient\nmatrix physically meaningful, and the coefficient vector is constrained to be\nsummed up to a scalar s<1 to make it more discriminative.

Entanglement is distributed between\nneighbouring nodes by loading spin singlets locally and then shuttling one\nmember of the pair through a linear array of empty dots. Each node contains one\ndata qubit, two ancilla qubits, and additional dots to facilitate electron\nshuttling and measurement of the ancillas. A four-node GHZ state is realized by\nsharing three internode singlets followed by local gate operations and ancilla\nmeasurements. Further local operations and measurements produce an X or Z\nstabilizer on four data qubits, which is the fundamental operation of the\nsurface code. Electron shuttling is simulated using a simplified gate electrode\ngeometry without explicit barrier gates, and demonstrates that adiabatic\ntransport is possible on timescales that do not present a speed bottleneck to\nthe processor. An important shuttling error in a clean system is uncontrolled\nphase rotation due to the modulation of the electronic g-factor during\ntransport, owing to the Stark effect. This error can be reduced by appropriate\nelectrostatic tuning of the stationary electron's g-factor. Using reasonable\nnoise models, we estimate error thresholds with respect to single and two-qubit\ngate fidelities as well as singlet dephasing errors during shuttling.

This leads to a more\nefficient method for modeling their trajectories over time, and hence, it can\nbetter capture their relationship to the survival outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 06:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

As a result, the similarity estimation of some\nhard samples might not be accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework, named Similarity-Guided Graph Neural Network (SGGNN) to\novercome such limitations. Given a probe image and several gallery images,\nSGGNN creates a graph to represent the pairwise relationships between\nprobe-gallery pairs (nodes) and utilizes such relationships to update the\nprobe-gallery relation features in an end-to-end manner.

The major\ndifficulty stems from the large diversity in the way people appear in crowds.\nIn fact, features available for crowd discrimination largely depend on the\ncrowd density to the extent that people are only seen as blobs in a highly\ndense scene. We tackle this problem with a growing CNN which can progressively\nincrease its capacity to account for the wide variability seen in crowd scenes.\nOur model starts from a base CNN density regressor, which is trained in\nequivalence on all types of crowd images. In order to adapt with the huge\ndiversity, we create two child regressors which are exact copies of the base\nCNN. A differential training procedure divides the dataset into two clusters\nand fine-tunes the child networks on their respective specialties.\nConsequently, without any hand-crafted criteria for forming specialties, the\nchild regressors become experts on certain types of crowds. The child networks\nare again split recursively, creating two experts at every division. This\nhierarchical training leads to a CNN tree, where the child regressors are more\nfine experts than any of their parents. The leaf nodes are taken as the final\nexperts and a classifier network is then trained to predict the correct\nspecialty for a given test image patch. The proposed model achieves higher\ncount accuracy on major crowd datasets.

These phenomenons are not independent from each others. We\nillustrate for instance that the doubly semibubble reduces the spin-orbit\nsplitting of low-l orbitals and modifies the splitting of relevant pseudospin\npartners, favoring N = 34 as a new magic number for neutron rich nuclei.

We revisit the displaced vertex signature that could\noccur in collisions at the LHC via the decay of heavy neutral leptons with\nmasses of a few GeV emphasizing the implications of flavor, kinematics,\ninclusive production and number of these extra neutral fermions.

In this work, we\nperform 3D numerical simulations which mimic a vortex-type photospheric driver\nwith a Gaussian spatial profile. This driver is implemented to excite MHD waves\nin an axially symmetric, 3D magnetic flux tube embedded in a realistic solar\natmosphere. The Gaussian width of the driver is varied and the resulting\nperturbations are compared. Velocity vectors were decomposed into parallel,\nperpendicular and azimuthal components with respect to pre-defined magnetic\nflux surfaces. These components correspond broadly to the fast, slow and Alfven\nmodes, respectively. From these velocities the corresponding wave energy fluxes\nare calculated, allowing us to estimate the contribution of each mode to the\nenergy flux. For the narrowest driver ($0.15$ Mm) the parallel component\naccounts for $\\sim 55 - 65\\%$ of the flux. This contribution increases smoothly\nwith driver width up to nearly $90\\%$ for the widest driver ($0.35$ Mm).

It thus has the remarkable property\nthat unlike previously proposed and observed TCIs, the non-trivial topology is\ngenerated by an external time-reversal breaking perturbation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 11:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 15:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

The structure consists of two quantum\nwells (QWs) coupled by a thin tunnel barrier. The DQW is subject to a\ntransverse electric field to create spatially indirect inter-QW excitons with\nelectrons and holes located in different QWs. We show that the presence of\nintra-QW charged excitons (trions) blocks carrier tunneling across the barrier\nto form indirect excitons, thus opening a gap in their emission spectrum. This\nbehavior is attributed to the low binding energy of the trions. Within the\ntunneling blockade regime, emission becomes dominated by processes involving\nexcitons bound to single shallow impurities, which behave as two-level centers\nactivated by resonant tunneling. The quantum nature of the emission is\nconfirmed by the anti-bunched photon emission statistics. The narrow\ndistribution of emission energies ($\\sim 10$~meV) and the electrical connection\nto the QWs make these single-exciton centers interesting candidates for\napplications in single-photon sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 13:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Yet there are currently very few tools available that are able to\ncompute and visualise not only attractors but also their basins. In the realm\nof asynchronous, non-deterministic modeling not only is the repertoire of\nsoftware even more limited, but also the formal notions for basins of\nattraction are often lacking. In this setting, the difficulty both for theory\nand computation arises from the fact that states may be ele- ments of several\ndistinct basins. In this paper we address this topic by partitioning the state\nspace into sets that are committed to the same attractors. These commitment\nsets can easily be generalised to sets that are equivalent w.r.t. the long-term\nbehaviours of pre-selected nodes which leads us to the notions of markers and\nphenotypes which we illustrate in a case study on bladder tumorigenesis. For\nevery concept we propose equivalent CTL model checking queries and an extension\nof the state of the art model checking software NuSMV is made available that is\ncapa- ble of computing the respective sets.

The key step in SNNs is to\nproperly scale the exponential linear unit (referred to as SELU) to inherently\nincorporate normalization based on central limit theory. SELU is a\nmonotonically increasing function, where it has an approximately constant\nnegative output for large negative input. In this work, we propose a new\nactivation function to break the monotonicity property of SELU while still\npreserving the self-normalizing property. Differently from SELU, the new\nfunction introduces a bump-shaped function in the region of negative input by\nregularizing a linear function with a scaled exponential function, which is\nreferred to as a scaled exponentially-regularized linear unit (SERLU). The\nbump-shaped function has approximately zero response to large negative input\nwhile being able to push the output of SERLU towards zero mean statistically.\nTo effectively combat over-fitting, we develop a so-called shift-dropout for\nSERLU, which includes standard dropout as a special case.

In particular, we show\nthat the dipole response in the so-called Pygmy Dipole Resonance region\ncorresponds to isoscalar-like surface oscillations, of larger strength in\nnuclei with a more diffuse surface. The ratio between the IV and IS Energy\nWeighted Sum Rule fractions exhausted in this region is shown to almost\nlinearly increase with the neutron skin thickness in Sn isotopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 13:35:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 16:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

To\nanswer these two questions in the scenario where randomly arriving packets are\ntransmitted over multi-state wireless fading channel, a probabilistic\ncross-layer scheduling policy is proposed in this paper, and characterized by a\nconstrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using the steady-state probability\nof the underlying Markov chain, we are able to derive the mathematical\nexpressions of the concerned metrics, namely, the average queueing delay and\nthe average power consumption.

Actor-based concurrency serialises all computations in an\nactor through asynchronous message passing. In contrast, lock-based concurrency\nserialises some computations by following a lock--unlock protocol for accessing\ncertain data. Both systems require sound reasoning about pointers and aliasing\nto exclude data-races. If actor isolation is broken, so is the\nsingle-thread-of-control abstraction. Similarly for locks, if a datum is\naccessible outside of the scope of the lock, the datum is not governed by the\nlock.\n  In this paper we discuss how to balance aliasing and synchronisation. In\nprevious work, we defined a type system that guarantees data-race freedom of\nactor-based concurrency and lock-based concurrency.

ELM randomly generates input weights and biases in the hidden\nlayer, and then calculates and computes the output weights by reducing the\niterative solution to the problem of linear equations. Therefore, ELM offers\nthe satisfying classification performance and fast training time than other\ndiscriminative models in tracking. However, the original ELM method often\nsuffers from the problem of the imbalanced classification distribution, which\nis caused by few target objects, leading to under-fitting and more background\nsamples leading to over-fitting. Worse still, it reduces the robustness of\ntracking under special conditions including occlusion, illumination, etc. To\naddress above problems, in this paper, we present a robust tracking algorithm.\nFirst, we introduce the local weight matrix that is the dynamic creation from\nthe data distribution at the current frame in the original ELM so as to balance\nbetween the empirical and structure risk, and fully learn the target object to\nenhance the classification performance. Second, we improve it to the\nincremental learning method ensuring tracking real-time and efficient. Finally,\nthe forgetting factor is used to strengthen the robustness for changing of the\nclassification distribution with time. Meanwhile, we propose a novel optimized\nmethod to obtain the optimal sample as the target object, which avoids tracking\ndrift resulting from noisy samples. Therefore, our tracking method can fully\nlearn both of the target object and background information to enhance the\ntracking performance, and it is evaluated in 20 challenge image sequences with\ndifferent attributes including illumination, occlusion, deformation, etc.,\nwhich achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of effectiveness and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 15:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

According to characteristics of the n-body\nsystem with point masses $(m_1,m_2,...,m_n)$, the gravitational field\nparameter, $\\alpha \\sim Gm_im_j$, the n-body system reduction mass $M_n$, and\nthe area, $A_n$, of the periodic orbit are selected as the basic parameters,\nwhile the period, $T_n$, and the system energy, $|E_n|$, are expressed as the\nthree basic parameters. Using the Buckingham $\\pi$ theorem, We obtained an epic\nresult, by working with a reduced gravitation parameter $\\alpha_n$, then\npredicting a dimensionless relation $T_n|E_n|^{3/2}=\\text{const} \\times\n\\alpha_n \\sqrt{\\mu_n}$ ($\\mu_n$ is reduced mass). The\nconst$=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}$ is derived by matching with the 2-body Kepler's\nthird law, and then a surprisingly simple relation for Kepler's third law of an\nn-body system is derived by invoking a symmetry constraint inspired from\nNewton's gravitational law: $T_n|E_n|^{3/2}=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}\nG\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=i+1}^n(m_im_j)^3}{\\sum_{k=1}^n\nm_k}\\right)^{1/2}$. This formulae is, of course, consistent with the Kepler's\nthird law of 2-body system, but yields a non-trivial prediction of the Kepler's\nthird law of 3-body: $T_3|E_3|^{3/2}= \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} G\n\\left[\\frac{(m_1m_2)^3+(m_1m_3)^3+(m_2m_3)^3}{m_1+m_2+m_3}\\right]^{1/2}$.

However, in the case of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), the efficiency is compromised\ndramatically due to the large amounts of data reuse. Although some mapping\nmethods have been designed to achieve a balance between the execution\nthroughput and resource overhead, the resource consumption cost is still huge\nwhile maintaining the throughput.\n  Network pruning is a promising and widely studied leverage to shrink the\nmodel size. Whereas, previous work didn`t consider the crossbar architecture\nand the corresponding mapping method, which cannot be directly utilized by\ncrossbar-based neural network accelerators. Tightly combining the crossbar\nstructure and its mapping, this paper proposes a crossbar-aware pruning\nframework based on a formulated L0-norm constrained optimization problem.\nSpecifically, we design an L0-norm constrained gradient descent (LGD) with\nrelaxant probabilistic projection (RPP) to solve this problem. Two grains of\nsparsity are successfully achieved: i) intuitive crossbar-grain sparsity and\nii) column-grain sparsity with output recombination, based on which we further\npropose an input feature maps (FMs) reorder method to improve the model\naccuracy. We evaluate our crossbar-aware pruning framework on median-scale\nCIFAR10 dataset and large-scale ImageNet dataset with VGG and ResNet models.\nOur method is able to reduce the crossbar overhead by 44%-72% with little\naccuracy degradation. This work greatly saves the resource and the related\nenergy cost, which provides a new co-design solution for mapping CNNs onto\nvarious crossbar devices with significantly higher efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 21:08:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 23:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 03:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

They can act as high-altitude flying relays to\nsupport communications between ground nodes due to their ability to provide\nline-of-sight links. With the flourishing Internet of Things, several types of\nnew applications are emerging. In this paper, we focus on bandwidth hungry and\ndelay-tolerant applications where multiple pairs of transceivers require the\nsupport of UAVs to complete their transmissions. To do so, the UAVs have the\npossibility to employ two different bands namely the typical microwave and the\nhigh-rate millimeter wave bands. In this paper, we develop a generic framework\nto assign UAVs to supported transceivers and optimize their trajectories such\nthat a weighted function of the total service time is minimized. Taking into\naccount both the communication time needed to relay the message and the flying\ntime of the UAVs, a mixed non-linear programming problem aiming at finding the\nstops at which the UAVs hover to forward the data to the receivers is\nformulated. An iterative approach is then developed to solve the problem.\nFirst, a mixed linear programming problem is optimally solved to determine the\npath of each available UAV. Then, a hierarchical iterative search is executed\nto enhance the UAV stops' locations and reduce the service time. The behavior\nof the UAVs and the benefits of the proposed framework are showcased for\nselected scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 22:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}
