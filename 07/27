Here we\nreview recent studies and consider the implications of social connection on\ncultural, epistemological and ideological contraction, then formalize these\nintuitions within the language of information theory. To systematically examine\nconnectivity and cultural diversity, we introduce new methods of manifold\nlearning to map both social networks and topic combinations into comparable,\ntwo-dimensional hyperbolic spaces or Poincar\\'e disks, which represent both\nhierarchy and diversity within a system. On a Poincar\\'e disk, radius from\ncenter traces the position of an actor in a social hierarchy or an idea in a\ncultural hierarchy. The angle of the disk required to inscribe connected actors\nor ideas captures their diversity. Using this method in the epistemic culture\nof 21st Century physics, we empirically demonstrate that denser university\ncollaborations systematically contract the space of topics discussed and ideas\ninvestigated more than shared topics drive collaboration, despite the extreme\ncommitments academic physicists make to research programs over the course of\ntheir careers. Dense connections unleash flows of communication that contract\notherwise fragmented semantic spaces into convergent hubs or polarized\nclusters. We theorize the dynamic interplay between structural expansion and\ncultural contraction and explore how this introduces an essential tension\nbetween the enjoyment and protection of difference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 16:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

The Kalman filter update step models\nthe non-linear relations between the speech, noise and reverberation\nlog-spectra. The Kalman filtering algorithm uses a signal model that takes into\naccount the reverberation parameters of the reverberation time, $T_{60}$, and\nthe direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) and also estimates and tracks the\n$T_{60}$ and the DRR in every frequency bin in order to improve the estimation\nof the speech log-magnitude spectrum. The Kalman filtering algorithm is tested\nand graphs that depict the estimated reverberation features over time are\nexamined. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of speech quality,\nspeech intelligibility and dereverberation performance for a range of\nreverberation parameters and SNRs, in different noise types, and is also\ncompared to competing denoising and dereverberation techniques.

This field\ntabulates the data of the 10398 real-space atomic limits of materials, and\nsolves the compatibility relations of electronic bands in momentum space. A\nmaterial that is not an atomic limit or whose bands do not satisfy the\ncompatibility relations, is a topological insulator/semimetal. We use TQC to\nfind the topological stoichiometric non-magnetic, \"high-quality'' materials in\nthe world. We develop several code additions to VASP which can compute all\ncharacters of all symmetries at all high-symmetry points in the Brillouin Zone\n(BZ). Using TQC we then develop codes to check which materials in ICSD are\ntopological. Out of 26938 stoichiometric materials in our filtered ICSD\ndatabase, we find 2861 topological insulators (TI) and 2936 topological\nsemimetals (2505 and 2560 non-f electron, respectively). Our method is uniquely\ncapable to show that none of the TI's found exhibit fragile topology. We\npartition the topological materials in different physical classes. For the\nmajority of the 5797 \"high-quality'' topological material, we compute: the\ntopological class (equivalence classes of TQC elementary band representations\n-- equivalent to the topological index), the symmetry(ies) that protects the\ntopological class, the representations at high symmetry points and the direct\ngap (for insulators), and the topological index. For topological semimetals we\nthen compute whether the system becomes a topological insulator (whose\nindex/class we compute) upon breaking symmetries -- useful for experiments.\n2152 more TI's are obtained in this way. For almost all 5065 non-f-electron\ntopological materials, we provide the electronic band structures, allowing the\nidentification of quantitative properties (gaps, velocities). Remarkably, our\nexhaustive results show that a large proportion ( ~ 24% !) of all materials in\nnature are topological (confirmed by calculations of \"low-quality'' materials).\nWe confirm the topology of several new materials by Wilson loop calculations.\nWe added an open-source code and end-user button on the Bilbao Crystallographic\nServer (BCS) which checks the topology of any material.

Our work is\nmotivated by the magic state model of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In\nthis model, all unitaries belong to the Clifford group. Non-Clifford operations\nare effected by injecting non-stabiliser states, which are referred to as magic\nstates in this context. The robustness of magic measures the complexity of\nsimulating such a circuit using a classical Monte Carlo algorithm. It is\nclosely related to the degree negativity that slows down Monte Carlo\nsimulations through the infamous sign problem. Surprisingly, the robustness of\nmagic is submultiplicative. This implies that the classical simulation overhead\nscales subexponentially with the number of injected magic states - better than\na naive analysis would suggest. However, determining the robustness of n copies\nof a magic state is difficult, as its definition involves a convex optimisation\nproblem in a 4^n-dimensional space. In this paper, we make use of inherent\nsymmetries to reduce the problem to n dimensions. The total run-time of our\nalgorithm, while still exponential in n, is super-polynomially faster than\npreviously published methods. We provide a computer implementation and give the\nrobustness of up to 10 copies of the most commonly used magic states. Guided by\nthe exact results, we find a finite hierarchy of approximate solutions where\neach level can be evaluated in polynomial time and yields rigorous upper bounds\nto the robustness. Technically, we use symmetries of the stabiliser polytope to\nconnect the robustness of magic to the geometry of a low-dimensional convex\npolytope generated by certain signed quantum weight enumerators. As a\nby-product, we characterised the automorphism group of the stabiliser polytope,\nand, more generally, of projections onto complex projective 3-designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 18:00:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 15:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 12:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

The exact discrete-time model,\nthat is, the discrete-time model whose state matches that of the\ncontinuous-time nonlinear system at the sampling instants may be difficult or\neven impossible to obtain. In this context, one approach to the analysis of\nstability is based on the use of an approximate discrete-time model and a bound\non the mismatch between the exact and approximate models. This approach\nrequires three conceptually different tasks: i) ensure the stability of the\n(approximate) discrete-time model, ii) ensure that the stability of the\napproximate model carries over to the exact model, iii) if necessary, bound\nintersample behaviour. Existing conditions for ensuring the stability of a\ndiscrete-time model as per task i) have some or all of the following drawbacks:\nare only sufficient but not necessary; do not allow for varying sampling rate;\ncannot be applied in the presence of state-measurement or actuation errors. In\nthis paper, we overcome these drawbacks by providing characterizations of, i.e.\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for, two stability properties: semiglobal\nasymptotic stability, robustly with respect to bounded disturbances, and\nsemiglobal input-to-state stability, where the (disturbance) input may\nsuccessfully represent state-measurement or actuation errors. Our results can\nbe applied when sampling is not necessarily uniform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 18:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

The interaction\nbetween the bubble cloud and the HIFU field is investigated using a\nthree-dimensional numerical model. The propagation of non-linear ultrasonic\nwaves in the tissue or in a phantom medium is modeled using the compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations on a fixed grid, while the microbubbles dynamics and\nmotion are modeled as discrete singularities, which are tracked in a Lagrangian\nframework. These two models are coupled to each other such that both the\nacoustic field and the bubbles influence each other. The temperature rise in\nthe field is calculated by solving a heat transfer equation applied over a much\nlonger time scale. The compressible continuum part of the model is validated by\nconducting HIFU simulation without microbubbles and comparing the pressure and\ntemperature fields against available experiments. The coupled\nEulerian-Lagrangian approach is then validated against existing experiments\nwith a phantom tissue. The various mechanisms through which microbubbles\nenhance heat deposition are then examined in detail. The effects of the initial\nvoid fraction in the cloud are then sought by considering the changes in the\nattenuation of the primary ultrasonic wave and the modifications of the\nenhanced heat deposition in the focal region. Finally, the effects of the\nmicrobubble cloud size and its localization in the focal region are shown and\nthe effects of these parameters in altering the temperature rise and the\nlocation of the temperature peak are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 18:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

SCAMP is motivated from the\npoint of view of non-parametric mixture modeling. Rather than maximizing a\nclassification likelihood to determine cluster assignments, SCAMP casts\nclustering as a search and selection problem. One consequence of this problem\nformulation is that the number of clusters is $\\textbf{not}$ a SCAMP tuning\nparameter. The search phase of SCAMP consists of finding sub-collections of the\ndata matrix, called candidate clusters, that obey shape constraints along each\ncoordinate projection. An extension of the dip test of Hartigan and Hartigan\n(1985) is developed to assist the search. Selection occurs by scoring each\ncandidate cluster with a preference function that quantifies prior belief about\nthe mixture composition. Clustering proceeds by selecting candidates to\nmaximize their total preference score. SCAMP concludes by annotating each\nselected cluster with labels that describe how cluster-level statistics compare\nto certain dataset-level quantities. SCAMP can be run multiple times on a\nsingle data matrix. Comparison of annotations obtained across iterations\nprovides a measure of clustering uncertainty. Simulation studies and\napplications to real data are considered.

We measure the galaxy bias by\ncomparing the first four moments of the galaxy density distribution with those\nof the dark matter distribution.

Recent studies have\nshown that these perturbations can be detected even without information about\nthe neural network if the strategy taken by the adversary is known beforehand.\nUnfortunately, these studies suffer from the generalization limitation -- the\ndetection method has to be recalibrated every time the adversary changes his\nstrategy. In this study, we attempt to overcome the generalization limitation\nby deriving a metric which reliably identifies adversarial images even when the\napproach taken by the adversary is unknown. Our metric leverages key\ndifferences between the spectra of clean and adversarial images when an image\nis treated as a matrix. Our metric is able to detect adversarial images across\ndifferent datasets and attack strategies without any additional re-calibration.\nIn addition, our approach provides geometric insights into several unanswered\nquestions about adversarial perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 19:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

The task is challenging due to disjoint views and\nillumination variation in different cameras. In this direction, many\ngraph-based methods were proposed using appearance-based features. However, the\nappearance information fades with high illumination variation in the different\ncamera FOVs. We, in this paper, use spatial and temporal information as the\nstate of the target to learn a policy that predicts the next camera given the\ncurrent state. The policy is trained using Q-learning and it does not assume\nany information about the topology of the camera network. We will show that the\npolicy learns the camera network topology.

Here we present a detailed analysis on the applicability of Pomeron\ndominance by means of a general class of forward scattering amplitude,\nconsisting of even-under-crossing leading contributions associated with single,\ndouble and triple poles in the complex angular momentum plane. We carry out\nfits to $pp$ and $\\bar{p}p$ data in the interval 5 GeV - 13 TeV. The data set\ncomprises all the accelerator data below 7 TeV and we consider two independent\nensembles by adding either only the TOTEM data or TOTEM and ATLAS data at the\nLHC energy region. In the data reductions to each ensemble the uncertainty\nregions are evaluated with both one and two standard deviation ($\\sim$ 68 \\%\nand $\\sim$ 95 \\% CL, respectively). Besides the general analytic model, we\ninvestigate four particular cases of interest, three of them typical of\noutstanding models in the literature. We conclude that, within the experimental\nand theoretical uncertainties and both ensembles, the general model and three\nparticular cases are not able to describe the $\\sigma_{tot}$ and $\\rho$ data at\n13 TeV simultaneously. However, if the discrepancies between the TOTEM and\nATLAS data are not resolved, one Pomeron model, associated with double and\ntriple poles and with only 7 free parameters, seems not to be excluded by the\ncomplete set of experimental information presently available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 19:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 03:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

The proposed model accommodates a set\nof regressors and a long-range dependent time series structure. We derive the\npartial likelihood estimator for the parameters of the proposed model, obtain\nthe associated score vector and Fisher information matrix. We also prove the\nconsistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator under mild conditions.\nHypotheses testing, diagnostic tools and forecasting are also proposed. A Monte\nCarlo simulation is considered to evaluate the finite sample performance of the\npartial likelihood estimators and to study some of the proposed tests. An\nempirical application is also presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 19:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

However, we also find that the critical exponent and echoing period\nappear to decrease with increasing departure from sphericity, and that, for\nsufficiently large departures from spherical symmetry, the deviations become\nunstable and grow, confirming earlier results by Choptuik et.al.. We find some\nevidence that these growing modes lead to a bifurcation, similar to those\nreported by Choptuik et.al., with two centers of collapse forming on the\nsymmetry axis above and below the origin. These findings suggest that nonlinear\nperturbations of the critical solution lead to changes in the effective values\nof the critical exponent, echoing period and damping coefficient, and may even\nchange the sign of the latter, so that perturbations that are stable in the\nlinear regime can become unstable in the nonlinear regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 20:05:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 18:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

Recent works in control of robotic\nsystems have effectively leveraged local, low-dimensional embeddings of\nhigh-dimensional dynamics. In this paper we combine these recent advances with\ntechniques from sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) in order to design a\nmethodology capable of planning for high-dimensional robotic systems beyond the\nreach of traditional approaches (e.g., humanoids, or even systems where\nplanning occurs in the visual space). Specifically, the learned latent space is\nconstructed through an autoencoding network, a dynamics network, and a\ncollision checking network, which mirror the three main algorithmic primitives\nof SBMP, namely state sampling, local steering, and collision checking.\nNotably, these networks can be trained through only raw data of the system's\nstates and actions along with a supervising collision checker. Building upon\nthese networks, an RRT-based algorithm is used to plan motions directly in the\nlatent space - we refer to this exploration algorithm as Learned Latent RRT\n(L2RRT). This algorithm globally explores the latent space and is capable of\ngeneralizing to new environments.

It is likely that only a few views are relevant to\nprediction, and the predictors within each relevant view contribute to the\nprediction collectively rather than sparsely. We cast this new problem under\nthe familiar multivariate regression framework and propose an integrative\nreduced-rank regression (iRRR), where each view has its own low-rank\ncoefficient matrix. As such, latent features are extracted from each view in a\nsupervised fashion. For model estimation, we develop a convex composite nuclear\nnorm penalization approach, which admits an efficient algorithm via alternating\ndirection method of multipliers. Extensions to non-Gaussian and incomplete data\nare discussed. Theoretically, we derive non-asymptotic oracle bounds of iRRR\nunder a restricted eigenvalue condition.

This includes mid-UV (1600-2700 Angstroms;\nuvw2 and uvm2) and near-UV (2700-4000 Angstroms; uvw1 and u) filters. We find\nthe observed colors to be much redder than the model predictions, and that\nthese offsets are unlikely to be caused by dust reddening. We confirm previous\nresults that high-velocity SNe Ia have red UV-optical colors. When correcting\nthe colors for dust reddening by assuming a constant b-v color we find no\ncorrelation between the uvw1-v or u-v colors and the ejecta velocities for 25\nSNe Ia with published velocities and/or spectra. When assuming an optical\ncolor-velocity relation, a correlation of 2 and 3.6 sigma is found for uvw1-v\nand u-v. However, we find that the correlation is driven by the reddening\ncorrection and can be reproduced with random colors which are corrected for\nreddening. The significance of a correlation between the UV colors and the\nvelocity is thus dependent on the assumed slope of the optical color-velocity\nrelation. After such a correction, the uvw1-v versus velocity slope is\nshallower than that predicted by the models and offset to redder colors. A\nsignificant scatter still remains in the uvw1-v colors including a large spread\nat low velocities. This demonstrates that the NUV-blue/red spread is not caused\nsolely by the photospheric velocity. The uvm2-uvw1 colors also show a large\ndispersion which is uncorrelated with the velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 22:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

It is noted that a cloaking\ntransformation is neither a spatial nor a referential change of frame\n(coordinates); a cloaking transformation maps the boundary-value problem of an\nisotropic and homogeneous elastic body (virtual problem) to that of an\nanisotropic and inhomogeneous elastic body with a hole surrounded by a cloak\nthat is to be designed (physical problem). The virtual body has a desired\nmechanical response while the physical body is designed to mimic the same\nresponse outside the cloak using a cloaking transformation. We show that\nnonlinear elastodynamics transformation cloaking is not possible while\nnonlinear elastostatics cloaking may be possible for special deformations,\ne.g., radial deformations in a body with either a cylindrical or a spherical\ncavity. For linear elastodynamics, in line with the previous observations in\nthe literature, we show that the elastic constants in the cloak are not fully\nsymmetric; they do not possess the minor symmetries. We prove that\ntransformation cloaking is not possible regardless of the shape of the hole and\nthe cloak. We next show that linear elastodynamics transformation cloaking\ncannot be achieved for gradient elastic solids either; similar to classical\nlinear elasticity the balance of angular momentum is the obstruction to\ntransformation cloaking. We finally prove that transformation cloaking is not\npossible for linear elastic generalized Cosserat solids in 2D for any shape of\nthe hole and the cloak. Particularly, in 2D, transformation cloaking cannot be\nachieved in linear Cosserat elasticity. We also show that transformation\ncloaking for a spherical cavity covered by a spherical cloak is not possible in\nthe setting of linear elastic generalized Cosserat solids.

The analysis is extended to include\nthe injection of a squeezed vacuum to the Mach-Zehnder arrangement and also to\nconsider an active, two-mode SU(1,1) interferometer in a similar arrangement.\nWhen detection loss is larger than $8\\%$, the SU(1,1) interferometer shows an\nadvantage over the MZ interferometer with single-mode squeezing input. The\nproposed system is based on current technology and could be used to examine the\nintersection of quantum theory and general relativity as well as for possible\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 01:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

The key idea is to compute\nthe full continuous-time trajectory from start to goal at each time-step. While\nthe robot traverses the trajectory, the history portion of the trajectory\nsignifies the solution to the estimation problem, and the future portion of the\ntrajectory signifies a solution to the planning problem. Building on recent\nprobabilistic inference approaches to continuous-time localization and mapping\nand continuous-time motion planning, we solve the joint problem by iteratively\nrecomputing the maximum a posteriori trajectory conditioned on all available\nsensor data and cost information. Our approach can contend with\nhigh-degree-of-freedom (DOF) trajectory spaces, uncertainty due to limited\nsensing capabilities, model inaccuracy, the stochastic effect of executing\nactions, and can find a solution in real-time.

The continuity\nof monolayer MoS2 on the rugged surface is evidenced by scanning electron\nmicroscopy, cross-section high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,\nphotoluminescence (PL) mapping, and Raman mapping. Interestingly, the\nphoto-responsivity (~254.5 mA/W) of as-grown MoS2 on the nano-rugged substrate\nexhibits 59 times higher than that of the planar sample (4.3 mA/W) under a\nsmall applied bias of 0.1 V. This value is record high when compared with all\nprevious MoS2-based photocurrent generation under low or zero bias. Such a\nlarge enhancement in the photo-responsivity arises from a large active area for\nlight-matter interaction and local strain for PL quenching, where the latter\neffect is the key factor and unique in the conformally grown monolayer on the\nnano-rugged surface.

An important problem in crowdsourcing is the task\nrecommendation problem, in which tasks that best match a particular worker's\npreferences and reliabilities are recommended to that worker. A task\nrecommendation scheme that assigns tasks more likely to be accepted by a worker\nwho is more likely to complete it reliably results in better performance for\nthe task requester. Without prior information about a worker, his preferences\nand reliabilities need to be learned over time. In this paper, we propose a\nmulti-armed bandit (MAB) framework to learn a worker's preferences and his\nreliabilities for different categories of tasks. However, unlike the classical\nMAB problem, the reward from the worker's completion of a task is unobservable.\nWe therefore include the use of gold tasks (i.e., tasks whose solutions are\nknown \\emph{a priori} and which do not produce any rewards) in our task\nrecommendation procedure. Our model could be viewed as a new variant of MAB, in\nwhich the random rewards can only be observed at those time steps where gold\ntasks are used, and the accuracy of estimating the expected reward of\nrecommending a task to a worker depends on the number of gold tasks used. We\nshow that the optimal regret is $O(\\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of tasks\nrecommended to the worker. We develop three task recommendation strategies to\ndetermine the number of gold tasks for different task categories, and show that\nthey are order optimal. Simulations verify the efficiency of our approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 05:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

There are two questions of interest to be addressed when\nconducting a joint GWAS analysis with multiple traits. The first question\nexamines whether a genetic loci is significantly associated with any of the\ntraits being tested. The second question focuses on identifying the specific\ntrait(s) that is associated with the genetic loci. Since existing methods\nprimarily focus on the first question, this paper seeks to provide a\ncomplementary method that addresses the second question. We propose a novel\nmethod, Variational Inference for Multiple Correlated Outcomes (VIMCO), that\nfocuses on identifying the specific trait that is associated with the genetic\nloci, when performing a joint GWAS analysis of multiple traits, while\naccounting for correlation among the multiple traits. We performed extensive\nnumerical studies and also applied VIMCO to analyze two datasets.

The case of a convex phonon branch is similar to the\nBose gas case: the leading collisional processes are the Beliaev-Landau\n3-phonons processes, and the variance is the sum of a ballistic term and of a\ndelayed diffusive term, whose analytical expressions are given in the\nthermodynamic limit.

It provides methods that facilitate the discovery of regularities in\ndata and that give predictions without explicit knowledge of the rules\ngoverning a system. However, a price is paid for exploiting such flexibility:\nmachine learning methods are typically black-boxes where it is difficult to\nfully understand what the machine is doing or how it is operating. This poses\nconstraints on the applicability and explainability of such methods. Methods:\nOur research aims to open the black-box of recurrent neural networks, an\nimportant family of neural networks used for processing sequential data. We\npropose a novel methodology that provides a mechanistic interpretation of\nbehaviour when solving a computational task. Our methodology uses mathematical\nconstructs called excitable network attractors, which are invariant sets in\nphase space composed of stable attractors and excitable connections between\nthem. Results and Discussion: As the behaviour of recurrent neural networks\ndepends both on training and on inputs to the system, we introduce an algorithm\nto extract network attractors directly from the trajectory of a neural network\nwhile solving tasks. Simulations conducted on a controlled benchmark task\nconfirm the relevance of these attractors for interpreting the behaviour of\nrecurrent neural networks, at least for tasks that involve learning a finite\nnumber of stable states and transitions between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 08:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 10:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2018 16:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 11:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 16:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2019 09:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

The idea is to allow a set\nof entities access the spectrum whenever and wherever it is unused by the\nlicensed users. In the proposed framework, different spectrum provider (SP)\nnetworks with surplus spectrum available may rank the operators requiring the\nspectrum, called spectrum users (SUs) hereafter, differently in terms of their\npreference to lease spectrum, based for example on target business market\nconsiderations of the SUs. Similarly, SUs rank SPs depending on a number of\ncriteria, for example based on coverage and availability in a service area.\nIdeally, both SPs and SUs prefer to provide/get spectrum to/from the operator\nof their first choice, but this is not necessarily always possible due to\nconflicting preferences. We apply matching theory algorithms with the aim to\nresolve the conflicting preferences of the SPs and SUs and quantify the effect\nof the proposed matching theory approach on establishing preferred (spectrum)\nprovider-user network pairs. We discuss both one-to-one and many-to-one\nspectrum sharing scenarios and evaluate the performance using Monte Carlo\nsimulations.

In this\nproblem, unknown links between nodes are discovered based on numerous\ninformation such as network topology, profile information and user generated\ncontents. Most of the previous researchers have focused on the structural\nfeatures of the networks. While the recent researches indicate that contextual\ninformation can change the network topology. Although, there are number of\nvaluable researches which combine structural and content information, but they\nface with the scalability issue due to feature engineering. Because, majority\nof the extracted features are obtained by a supervised or semi supervised\nalgorithm. Moreover, the existing features are not general enough to indicate\ngood performance on different networks with heterogeneous structures. Besides,\nmost of the previous researches are presented for undirected and unweighted\nnetworks.

In contrast to the previous\nresearches which fail to automatically extract best features for the link\nprediction, deep learning reduces the manual feature engineering. In this\nframework, both the structural and content information of the nodes are\nemployed.

While the treatment\nof a moving complex boundary is an extremely time consuming and formidable task\nin a traditional boundary-fitted fluid solver, the one-fluid methods provide a\nrelatively easier way to track moving interfaces on a fixed Cartesian grid\nsince the regeneration of a mesh system that conforms to the interface at every\ntime step can be avoided. In the IBM, a series of connected Lagrangian markers\nare used to represent a fluid-fluid interface and the boundary condition is\nenforced by adding a forcing term to the Navier-Stokes equations. It is known\nthat the IBM suffers two problems. One is spontaneous generation of unphysical\nkinetic energy, which is known as parasitic currents, and the other is spurious\nreconstruction of interface. These two problems need to be solved for useful\nlong-time-scale simulations of droplets with high density ratio and large\nsurface tension. This work detects that the discrete delta function is the\ncause of unphysical parasitic currents. Specifically, the irrotational\ncondition is not preserved when the common discrete delta function is used to\nspread the surface tension from Lagrangian markers to Cartesian grid cells. To\nsolve this problem, a new scheme that preserves the irrotational condition is\nproposed to remove the spurious currents. Furthermore, for a smooth\nreconstruction of an interface, a B-spline fitting by least squares is adopted\nto relocate the Lagrangian markers. The conventional and new interpolation\nschemes are implemented in a multigrid finite volume Direct Numerical\nSimulation (DNS) solver and are subjected to standard test cases. It is\nconfirmed that the unphysical parasitic currents are substantially reduced in\nthe new scheme and droplet's surface fluctuation is eliminated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 09:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

The recent detection of IceCube-170922A, a\n$\\sim$300 TeV neutrino potentially correlated with the flaring $\\gamma$-ray\nsource TXS 0506+056, directs attention toward BL Lac objects (BL Lacs), the\nsubclass of blazars with weak emission lines. While high-energy neutrinos can\nbe produced via photohadronic interactions between protons accelerated in their\njets and ambient low-energy photons, the density of the latter in such objects\nhad generally been thought to be too low for efficient neutrino emission.

In constrast, for\nhigh-synchrotron-peak BL Lacs including Mkn 421 and Mkn 501, the contribution\nof RIAFs is subdominant and their neutrino production efficiency can remain\nlow, consistent with their non-detection by IceCube to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 09:28:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 08:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

They allow a user to bid on spare compute capacity in Amazon's\ndata centres at heavily discounted prices.

We relate the data we find to the overall AWS region as\nwell as to the Availability Zone within that region.\n  We conclude that location does play a critical role in spot instance pricing\nand also that pricing differs depending on the granularity of that location -\nfrom a more coarse-grained AWS region to a more fine-grained Availability Zone\nwithin a region. We relate the pricing differences we find to the price's\nreliability, confirming whether one can be confident in the prices reported and\nsubsequently, in the ensuing bids one makes.\n  We conclude by showing that it is possible to run workloads on Spot Instances\nachieving both a very low risk of termination as well as paying very low\namounts per hour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 09:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

An ionization stratification (higher line shift at\nhigher ionization potential) implies that we see a large-scale outflow rather\nthan single, localized jet-cloud interactions. Similarly, the paucity of\nzero-velocity [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 emitting gas implies the absence of a second\nnarrow-line region (NLR) component at rest, and therefore a large part of the\nhigh-ionization NLR is affected by the outflow.

This configuration results in a\njurisdictional overflow from the legal framework of the countries where the RIR\nis based to all the countries that the RIRs are serving (the countries served\nby the RIRs de facto become subjects of the legal system of the country where\nthe RIR is hosted). The situation is aggravated by the deployment of new\nsecurity techniques such as the RPKI and BGPsec, that enable enforcement of\nallocations by the RIRs. In this paper we present InBlock, a blockchain-based\ndistributed governance body aimed to provide de-centralized management of IP\naddresses. InBlock also aims to fulfil the same objectives as the current IP\naddress allocation system, namely, uniqueness, fairness, conservation,\naggregation, registration and minimized overhead. InBlock is implemented as a\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization, i.e., as a set of blockchain's smart\ncontracts in Ethereum. Any entity may request an allocation of addresses to the\nInBlock registry by solely performing a (crypto)currency transfer to the\nInBlock. The fee required, along with the annual renewal fee, serves as a\nmechanism to deter stockpiling and other wasteful practices. As with any novel\ntechnology, there are many open questions about the usage of blockchains to\nbuild an IP address registry. For this reason, we believe that practical\nexperimentation is required in order to have hands-on experiences about such a\nsystem. We propose to conduct an experiment on distributed address management\nusing InBlock as a starting point to inform future directions in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 10:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

Firstly, the appropriately defined relaxation time\nin the holographic models decreases with temperature in the same way. More\nimportantly, the holographic $k$-gap increases with temperature and with the\ninverse of the relaxation time. Our results suggest that the Maxwell-Frenkel\napproach to liquids, involving the additivity of liquid hydrodynamic and\nsolid-like elastic responses, can be applicable to a much wider class of\nphysical systems and effects than thought previously, including relativistic\nmodels and strongly-coupled quantum field theories. More precisely, the\ndispersion relation of the propagating shear waves is in perfect agreement with\nthe Maxwell-Frenkel approach.

Other frequency separations we detect may\nrepresent the small frequency separation, $\\delta\\nu$, but this is inconclusive\nat this stage due to magnetic perturbation of the frequencies. Due to the\nhighly non-linear pulsation in 33 Lib, we identify harmonics to four times the\nprincipal frequency. Furthermore, we note a unique occurrence of non-linear\ninteractions of the 11 identified modes. The frequency separations of the modes\naround the principal frequency are replicated around the first harmonic, with\nsome interaction with the second harmonic also. Such a phenomenon has not been\nseen in roAp stars before.

As the technology\nhas rapidly became more powerful on scoring exams and essays, especially from\nthe 1990s onwards, partially or wholly automated grading systems using\ncomputational methods have evolved and have become a major area of research. In\nparticular, the demand of scoring of natural language responses has created a\nneed for tools that can be applied to automatically grade these responses. In\nthis paper, we focus on the concept of automatic grading of short answer\nquestions such as are typical in the UK GCSE system, and providing useful\nfeedback on their answers to students. We present experimental results on a\ndataset provided from the introductory computer science class in the University\nof North Texas. We first apply standard data mining techniques to the corpus of\nstudent answers for the purpose of measuring similarity between the student\nanswers and the model answer.

The problem is solved in two steps: (1)\nidentifying and segmenting various object surfaces and, (2) searching for\nsuitable grasping handles on these surfaces by applying geometric constraints\nof the physical gripper. The first step is solved by using a modified version\nof region growing algorithm that uses a pair of thresholds for smoothness\nconstraint on local surface normals to find natural boundaries of object\nsurfaces. In this process, a novel concept of edge point is introduced that\nallows us to segment between different surfaces of the same object. The second\nstep is solved by converting a 6D pose detection problem into a 1D linear\nsearch problem by projecting 3D cloud points onto the principal axes of the\nobject surface. The graspable handles are then localized by applying physical\nconstraints of the gripper.

Thanks to the recently\ndescribed (Smurf) 2-phase model of ageing we were allowed to propose a fresh\nangle for modeling the evolution of ageing. Indeed, by coupling a dramatic loss\nof fertility with a high-risk of impending death - amongst other multiple\nso-called hallmarks of ageing - the Smurf phenotype allowed us to consider\nageing as a couple of sharp transitions. The birth-death model (later called\nbd-model) we describe here is a simple life-history trait model where each\nasexual and haploid individual is described by its fertility period $x_b$ and\nsurvival period $x_d$. We show that, thanks to the Lansing effect, $x_b$ and\n$x_d$ converge during evolution to configurations $x_b-x_d\\approx 0$. This\nguarantees that a certain proportion of the population maintains the Lansing\neffect which in turn, confers higher evolvability to individuals. \\\\To do so,\nwe built an individual-based stochastic model which describes the age and trait\ndistribution dynamics of such a finite population. Then we rigorously derive\nthe adaptive dynamics models, which describe the trait dynamics at the\nevolutionary time-scale. We extend the Trait Substitution Sequence with age\nstructure to take into account the Lansing effect. Finally, we study the\nlimiting behaviour of this jump process when mutations are small. We show that\nthe limiting behaviour is described by a differential inclusion whose solutions\n$x(t)=(x_b(t),x_d(t))$ reach the diagonal $\\lbrace x_b=x_d\\rbrace$ in finite\ntime and then remain on it.

Our main goal is\nto understand better atmospheric processes affecting biosignatures and climate\non such worlds. Furthermore, this is the first study to our knowledge which\napplies an automated chemical pathway analysis quantifying the production and\ndestruction pathways of O$_2$ for an Earth-like planet with an Archean O$_2$\nabundance orbiting in the habitable zone of the M-dwarf AD Leo. Results suggest\nthat the main production arises in the upper atmosphere from CO$_2$ photolysis\nfollowed by catalytic HO$_x$ reactions. The strongest destruction does not take\nplace in the troposphere, as was the case in Gebauer et al. (2017) for an\nearly-Earth analog planet around the Sun, but instead in the middle atmosphere\nwhere H$_2$O photolysis is the strongest. This result was driven by the strong\nLyman-$\\alpha$-radiation output of AD Leo, which efficiently photolyzes H$_2$O.\nResults further suggest that early Earth-like atmospheres of planets orbiting\nan M-dwarf like AD Leo are in absolute terms less destructive for atmospheric\nO$_2$ than for early-Earth analog planets around the Sun despite higher\nconcentrations of reduced gases such as e.g. H$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. Hence the\nnet primary productivity (NPP) required to produce the same amount of\natmospheric O$_2$ at the surface is reduced. This implies that a possible Great\nOxidation event, analogous to that on Earth, would have occurred earlier in\ntime in analog atmospheres around M-dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 13:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

First,\nwe show that by appropriately screening the one- and two-electron integrals of\nthe Hamiltonian one can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by several\norders of magnitude. This improved efficiency comes with the added benefit that\nthe resulting algorithm scales as the second power of the system size $O(N^2)$,\ndown from the fourth power $O(N^4)$. Using numerical results, we demonstrate\nthat the practical scaling obtained is in fact $O(N^{1.5})$ for a chain of\nHydrogen atoms, and $O(N^{1.2})$ for the Hubbard model. Second, we introduce\nthe use of the rejection-free continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) to sample the\ndeterminants. CTMC is usually prohibitively expensive because of the need to\ncalculate a large number of intermediates. Here, we take advantage of the fact\nthat these intermediates are already calculated during the evaluation of the\nlocal energy and consequently, just by storing them one can use the CTCM\nalgorithm with virtually no overhead. Third, we show that by using the adaptive\nstochastic gradient descent algorithm called AMSGrad one can optimize the\nwavefunction energies robustly and efficiently. The combination of these three\nimprovements allows us to calculate the ground state energy of a chain of 160\nhydrogen atoms using a wavefunction containing $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ variational\nparameters with an accuracy of 1 $mE_h$/particle at a cost of just 25 CPU\nhours, which when split over 2 nodes of 24 processors each amounts to only\nabout half hour of wall time.

Classical novae are explosive phenomena that take place in stellar\nbinary systems. They are powered by mass transfer from a low-mass main sequence\nstar onto a white dwarf (either CO or ONe). The material accumulates for 10+4 -\n10+5 yr until ignition under degenerate conditions, resulting in a\nthermonuclear runaway. The nuclear energy released produces peak temperatures\nof about 0.1 - 0.4 GK. During these events, 10-7 - 10-3 Msun enriched in\nintermediate-mass elements (with respect to solar abundances) are ejected into\nthe interstellar medium. However, the origin of the large metallicity\nenhancements and the inhomogeneous distribution of chemical species observed in\nhigh-resolution spectra of ejected nova shells is not fully understood. Aims.\nRecent multidimensional simulations have demonstrated that Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities that operate at the core-envelope interface can naturally produce\nself-enrichment of the accreted envelope with material from the underlying\nwhite dwarf at levels that agree with observations. However, such\nmultidimensional simulations have been performed for a small number of cases,\nand much of the parameter space remains unexplored. Methods. Here we\ninvestigate the dredge-up, driven by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, for white\ndwarf masses in the range 0.8-1.25 Msun and different core compositions\n(CO-rich and ONe-rich substrates). We present a set of five numerical\nsimulations performed in two dimensions aimed at analyzing the possible impact\nof the white dwarf mass (and composition) on the metallicity enhancement and on\nthe explosion characteristics. Results. We observe greater mixing (about 30 per\ncent higher when measured in the same conditions), at the time we stop the\nsimulations, and more energetic outbursts for ONe-rich substrates than for\nCO-rich substrates and for more massive white dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 14:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

The 0.49 m MTZD consists of a combination of a 2D magnetic\nquadrupole guide and deceleration coils, which together produce an array of 3D\nmagnetic traps. The design is based on that of Trimeche et al. with significant\nmodifications. The 2D quadrupole is driven by fast rising and falling square\npulses of current (up to 700 A) of arbitrary lengths of time. The traps can be\nmade to move at velocities from ca. 370 m/s down to zero, which is done by\ndriving through the deceleration coils a sinusoidal current with frequencies\nranging from zero to ca. 9 kHz and peak currents up to 1000 A. The trap\nvelocity is proportional to the current frequency. The MTZD manipulates the\nvelocities of molecular beams by traveling initially at the same velocity as\nthe beam. 3D guiding is achieved with a constant current frequency and\ndeceleration is achieved with a downward chirp of the current frequency at a\nrate corresponding to the desired deceleration. We explain the technical design\nand operation principles of the MTZD and we detail the custom power electronics\nthat drive the 2D quadrupole guide and the decelerator coils. We present\nextensive Monte-Carlo trajectory simulations to demonstrate the properties of\nthe MTZD and we conclude that decelerations should be kept below 30000 m/s/s to\nmaintain a good 6D phase-space acceptance. In proof-of-principle experiments,\nwith the deceleration coils operating with a reduced current in the range\n100-200 A, we demonstrate the 3D guiding of a beam of metastable argon atoms at\n373 m/s and deceleration at 25000 m/s/s from 342 m/s to 304 m/s. The\ndeceleration corresponds to the removal of 21% of the kinetic energy of the\nbeam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 14:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

The usage of these\nplatforms to verify systems down to binary-level is appealing due to the high\ndegree of automation they provide. How- ever, it introduces the need for\ntrusting the correctness of the translation from binary code to intermediate\nlanguage. Achieving a high degree of trust is challenging since this\ntranspilation must handle (i) all the side effects of the instructions, (ii)\nmultiple instruction encoding (e.g. ARM Thumb), and (iii) variable instruction\nlength (e.g. Intel). We overcome these problems by formally modeling one of\nsuch intermediate languages in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 and by\nimplementing a proof- producing transpiler. This tool translates ARMv8 programs\nto the in- termediate language and generates a HOL4 proof that demonstrates the\ncorrectness of the translation in the form of a simulation theorem. We also\nshow how the transpiler theorems can be used to transfer properties verified on\nthe intermediate language to the binary code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 14:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

C-V2X is based on the use of\nadvanced physical layer techniques and orthogonal resources, and one of the\nmain aspects affecting its performance is the way resources are allocated.\nAllocations can be either managed by the network or in a distributed way,\ndirectly by the nodes. The latter case, called Mode 4, is defined to manage\nthose situations where the network cannot be involved in the scheduling\nprocess, for example due to a lack of coverage, but could also be adopted in\norder to reduce the processing burden of eNodeB. An algorithm, defined in the\nstandards, makes nodes sense the medium and identify the best time-frequency\ncombination to allocate their messages.

In\nparticular, the assumed Markovian nature of mobility was used to establish a\ntheoretical upper bound on the predictability of human mobility (expressed as a\nminimum error probability limit), based on temporally correlated entropy. Since\nits inception, this bound has been widely used and empirically validated using\nMarkov chains. We show that recurrent-neural architectures can achieve\nsignificantly higher predictability, surpassing this widely used upper bound.\nIn order to explain this anomaly, we shed light on several underlying\nassumptions in previous research works that has resulted in this bias. By\nevaluating the mobility predictability on real-world datasets, we show that\nhuman mobility exhibits scale-invariant long-range correlations, bearing\nsimilarity to a power-law decay. This is in contrast to the initial assumption\nthat human mobility follows an exponential decay. This assumption of\nexponential decay coupled with Lempel-Ziv compression in computing Fano's\ninequality has led to an inaccurate estimation of the predictability upper\nbound. We show that this approach inflates the entropy, consequently lowering\nthe upper bound on human mobility predictability. We finally highlight that\nthis approach tends to overlook long-range correlations in human mobility.

Moreover, explicit formulas for $G_2(n)$ and $G_3(n)$ are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 01:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

We use a system of Patlak-Keller-Segel type as a model of the\ncommunity. It is well-known that such systems can produce complex unsteady\npatterns of behaviour which are usually explained mathematically by\nbifurcations of some basic solutions that describe simpler patterns. As far as\nwe aware, all such bifurcations in the models of the Patlak-Keller-Segel type\nhad been found for homogeneous (i.e. translationally invariant) systems where\nthe basic solutions are equilibria with homogeneous distributions of all\nspecies. The model considered in the present paper does not possess the\ntranslational invariance: one of species (the predators) is assumed to be\ncapable of moving in response to a signal produced externally in addition to\nthe signal emitted by another species (the prey). For instance, the external\nsignal may arise from the inhomogeneity of the distribution of an environmental\ncharacteristic such as temperature, salinity, terrain relief, etc. Our goal is\nto examine the effect of short-wavelength inhomogeneity. To do this, we employ\na certain homogenization procedure. We separate the short-wavelength and smooth\ncomponents of the system response and derive a slow system governing the latter\none. Analysing the slow system and comparing it with the case of homogeneous\nenvironment shows that, generically, a short-wavelength inhomogeneity results\nin an exponential decrease in the motility of the predators. The loss of\nmotility prevents, to a great extent, the occurrence of complex unsteady\npatterns and dramatically stabilizes the primitive basic solution. In some\nsense, the necessity of dealing with intensive small-scale changes of the\nenvironment makes the system unable to respond to other challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 14:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 11:59:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 11:16:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 23:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

In this paper, we address all these\nproblems under a novel multi-view deep generative framework.

By imposing a Gaussian mixture assumption on the posterior approximation\nof the shared latent variables, our framework can learn the joint deep\nrepresentation from multiple modalities and evaluate the importance of each\nmodality simultaneously. To solve the labeled-data-scarcity problem, we extend\nour multi-view model to semi-supervised learning scenario by casting the\nsemi-supervised classification problem as a specialized missing data imputation\ntask. To address the missing-modality problem, we further extend our\nsemi-supervised multi-view model to deal with incomplete data, where a missing\nview is treated as a latent variable and integrated out during inference. This\nway, the proposed overall framework can utilize all available (both labeled and\nunlabeled, as well as both complete and incomplete) data to improve its\ngeneralization ability. The experiments conducted on two real multi-modal\nemotion datasets demonstrated the superiority of our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 07:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Due to the inconsistency in the visual\nappearance, this practice tends to degrade the retrieval accuracy particularly\nwhen the image ROI, which is usually interpreted as the image objectness,\naccounts for a smaller region in the image. Since Privileged Information (PI),\nwhich can be viewed as the image prior, enables well characterizing the image\nobjectness, we are aiming at leveraging PI for further improving the\nperformance of the multi-view re-ranking accuracy in this paper. Towards this\nend, we propose a discriminative multi-view re-ranking approach in which both\nthe original global image visual contents and the local auxiliary PI features\nare simultaneously integrated into a unified training framework for generating\nthe latent subspaces with sufficient discriminating power. For the on-the-fly\nre-ranking, since the multi-view PI features are unavailable, we only project\nthe original multi-view image representations onto the latent subspace, and\nthus the re-ranking can be achieved by computing and sorting the distances from\nthe multi-view embeddings to the separating hyperplane. Extensive experimental\nevaluations on the two public benchmarks Oxford5k and Paris6k reveal our\napproach provides further performance boost for accurate image re-ranking,\nwhilst the comparative study demonstrates the advantage of our method against\nother multi-view re-ranking methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 18:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

While currently 32 teams participate in this\nevent, starting with 2026 the number of participants will increase to 48. As a\nresult, FIFA proposed a major format change, the groups of 4 teams will be\nreplaced by groups of 3 teams, with the first two teams to qualify to the\nsecond round. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of matches with limited\nimportance (called non-competitive) for final group standing for both 4-team\nand 3-team groups and we introduce our definitions of collusion and dead rubber\ngames. Next, we discuss scenarios in both 4-team and 3-team group formats that\nlead to such matches. Finally, we make an analysis of all group stage matches\nfrom last six World Cup editions (1998 to 2018), and we predict the most likely\nnumber of collusions and dead rubber games for the new format of the World Cup.\nDuring our analysis we consider a variation of the proposed 3-group format in\nwhich the order of matches for each group is predetermined. Our analysis show\nthat this variation has the potential of reducing significantly the number of\nboth collusion and dead rubber matches thus becoming an interesting option to\nbe considered for adoption by FIFA. In conclusion, we recommend FIFA to\nimplement a predefined order of group matches prior to the drawing. The seeded\nteam should play the first match with the team that is second best (according\nto the drawing time FIFA Coca-Cola rankings), as well as the second match from\nthe group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 11:53:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 14:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

Physical layer network\ncoding (PNC) allows Access Points (APs) to relay compressed, network coded user\ndata, therefore reducing the backhaul traffic. In this paper, an implementation\nof uplink Network Coded Modulation (NetCoM) with PNC is presented. A 5-node\nprototype NetCoM system is established using Universal Software Radio\nPeripherals (USRPs) and a practical PNC scheme designed for binary systems is\nutilised. An orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform\nimplementation and the practical challenges (e.g. device synchronisation and\nclock drift) of applying OFDM to NetCoM are discussed. To the best of our\nknowledge this is the first PNC implementation in an uplink scenario in radio\naccess networks and our prototype provides an industrially-applicable\nimplementation of the proposed NetCoM with PNC approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 16:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

In this way, although we\nstill cannot see the extra dimension, we can relate it to physical quantities\nthat are able to exert such a mechanism of matter induction in the observable\nuniverse. In this work we propose that scalar fields are those physical\nquantities.
