In particular the power\nspectral index, which governs the slope on the $P(k)$ graph, can be related to\ncritical scaling exponents derived from the Wilson renormalization group\nanalysis. We find that the derived value fits favorably with the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey telescope data.

Our approach contrasts with the conventional explanation\nwhich uses inflation to generate the scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich\nspectrum on CMB scales, and uses the transfer function to extrapolate it to\ngalaxy regime. The results we present here only assume quantum field theory and\nEinstein's Gravity, and hence provide a competing explanation of the power\nspectrum, without relying on the assumptions usually associated with\ninflationary models.

The theory predicts that the ring is stable\nfor $1 \\leq \\lambda \\leq 2$, where $\\lambda=\\omega_z/\\omega_r$ is the ratio of\nthe trapping frequencies along the $z$ and $r$ axes, i.e., for spherical to\nslightly oblate condensates. We compare this prediction with direct numerical\nsimulations of the full 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) capturing the\nlinearization spectrum of the ring for different values of the chemical\npotential and as a function of the anisotropy parameter $\\lambda$. We identify\nthis result as being only asymptotically valid as the chemical potential $\\mu\n\\rightarrow \\infty$, revealing how the stability interval narrows and, in\nparticular, its upper bound decreases for finite $\\mu$. Finally, we compare at\nthe dynamical level the results of the GPE with the ones effectively capturing\nthe ring dynamics, revealing the unstable evolution for different values of\n$\\lambda$, as well as the good agreement between the two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 16:47:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 18:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

However,\nlearning the parameters of neural networks usually demands a large amount of\nlabeled data. The algorithms of deep learning, therefore, encounter\ndifficulties when applied to supervised learning where only little data are\navailable. This specific task is called few-shot learning. To address it, we\npropose a novel algorithm for few-shot learning using discrete geometry, in the\nsense that the samples in a class are modeled as a reduced simplex. The volume\nof the simplex is used for the measurement of class scatter. During testing,\ncombined with the test sample and the points in the class, a new simplex is\nformed. Then the similarity between the test sample and the class can be\nquantized with the ratio of volumes of the new simplex to the original class\nsimplex. Moreover, we present an approach to constructing simplices using local\nregions of feature maps yielded by convolutional neural networks.

This is done via a new\nstochastic optimization algorithm, \\emph{Probabilistic Surface Optimization}\n(PSO), that turns to advantage the stochastic nature of sample points in order\nto force network output to be identical to the output of a target pdf. Once\ntrained, query point evaluation can be efficiently done in DeepPDF by a simple\nnetwork forward pass, with linear complexity in the number of query points.\nMoreover, the PSO algorithm is capable of inferring the frequency of data\nsamples and may also be used in other statistical tasks such as conditional\nestimation and distribution transformation. We compare the derived approach\nwith KDE methods showing its superior performance and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 16:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 11:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

This leads naturally to an iterative scheme, which is based\non a probabilistic generative model that is fit using Gauss-Newton updates\nwithin an EM-like framework. It was developed with the aim of enabling\ndistributed privacy-preserving analysis of brain image data, such that shared\ninformation (shape and appearance basis functions) may be passed across sites,\nwhereas latent variables that encode individual images remain secure within\neach site. These latent variables are proposed as features for\nprivacy-preserving data mining applications.\n  The approach is demonstrated qualitatively on the KDEF dataset of 2D face\nimages, showing that it can align images that traditionally require shape and\nappearance models trained using manually annotated data (manually defined\nlandmarks etc.). It is applied to MNIST dataset of handwritten digits to show\nits potential for machine learning applications, particularly when training\ndata is limited. The model is able to handle ``missing data'', which allows it\nto be cross-validated according to how well it can predict left-out voxels.

The cornerstone of the approach is\nan original model of the mean flow, representing it as a stationary vortex\nscaling with the mean recirculation length. We test our model on a set of mean\nseparated topologies, obtained by forcing the flow over a descending ramp with\na rack of synthetic jets.

There exist a variety of\nproblems in galactic dynamics which require the propagation of the orbital\nuncertainty for more than one or two objects and the first order linearised\ntransformation provides an efficient method which works to Gyr time scales for\nsmall initial uncertainty problems and for propagation over hundreds of million\nyears for larger initial uncertainty problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 17:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Clustering\nintroduces hierarchy in ad hoc networks where control functions can be carried\nout by some designated cluster heads. It is also an effective solution to\nhandle challenges due to lack of centralized controllers and infrastructure in\nad-hoc networks. Clustered network topologies gain a significant amount of\nscalability and reliability in comparison to flat topologies. Different roles\nthat nodes have in a clustered network can be effectively used for routing as\nwell. In this paper, we propose a novel plane-separated routing algorithm,\nCluster-based Hybrid Routing Algorithm (CHRA). In CHRA, we take advantage of\nthe hierarchical clustered structure through control and user plane separation\n(CUPS) in mobile ad-hoc networks. In the cluster neighborhood with a particular\nsize, a link-state routing is used to minimize delay, control overhead, and\nalso utilize energy consumption. For facilitating the communication with\ndistant nodes, we form a routing backbone that is responsible for both control\nand data messages. The results show that CHRA outperforms its opponents in\nterms of fair energy consumption and end-to-end delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 17:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

Furthermore,\nstellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and\nevolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters,\nranging from ages of 50 Myr to 350 Myr, how broadband UBV color-color relations\ncan be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers,\ncertain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This\nUBV color-color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B-V) and\nestimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities\ncreate a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common\nisochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters\nusing these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the\nphotometrically fit cluster distances to those based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes\nfind that they are consistent for all clusters. For older (>100 Myr) clusters,\nlike the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium\ndepletion boundary method finds that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within\n~10% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the\nGeneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with\nlithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly\ndiverge to become 30% to 80% younger. This illustrates the importance of\nrotation for deriving ages in the youngest (<100 Myr) clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

We call this learning mechanism \"theory-driven\", as it explicitly\nuses domain-specific theories to guide the learning, thus distinguishing itself\nfrom purely data-driven supervised learning. We show through a compliance\nminimization problem that the proposed learning mechanism leads to topology\ngeneration with near-optimal structural compliance, much improved from standard\nsupervised learning under the same computational budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 18:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 22:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 21:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

A central computational task is to map\nindividual data volumes to standardized templates. This is accomplished by\nregularized estimation of a diffeomorphic transformation between the coordinate\nsystems of the individual data and the template, building the transformation\nincrementally by integrating a smooth flow field. The canonical volume form of\nthis transformation is used to quantify local growth, atrophy, or cell density.\nWhile multiple implementations exist for this estimation, less attention has\nbeen paid to the variance of the estimated diffeomorphism for noisy data.\nNotably, there is an infinite dimensional un-observable space defined by those\ndiffeomorphisms which leave the template invariant. These form the stabilizer\nsubgroup of the diffeomorphic group acting on the template. The corresponding\nflat directions in the energy landscape are expected to lead to increased\nestimation variance. Here we show that a least-action principle used to\ngenerate geodesics in the space of diffeomorphisms connecting the subject brain\nto the template removes the stabilizer. This provides reduced-variance\nestimates of the volume form. Using simulations we demonstrate that the\nasymmetric large deformation diffeomorphic mapping methods (LDDMM), which\nexplicitly incorporate the asymmetry between idealized template images and\nnoisy empirical images, provide lower variance estimators than their\nsymmetrized counterparts (cf.

As an\nillustrative example, we extend the Wolf Sheep Predation model (included with\nNetLogo) by using ACMCC to guide animal behavior, and analyze the impact on\nagent performance and model dynamics. We find that ACMCC provides a reliable\nand understandable method of controlling agent intelligence, and has a large\nimpact on agent performance and model dynamics even at low settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

Accurate\nPET image reconstruction requires attenuation correction, which is based on the\nelectron density of tissues and can be obtained from CT images. While CT\nmeasures electron density information for x-ray photons, MR images convey\ninformation about the magnetic properties of tissues. Therefore, with the\nadvent of PET-MR systems, the attenuation coefficients need to be indirectly\nestimated from MR images. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional\nneural network (CNN) based method to synthesize head CT from ultra-short\necho-time (UTE) dual-echo MR images. Unlike traditional $T_1$-w images which do\nnot have any bone signal, UTE images show some signal for bone, which makes it\na good candidate for MR to CT synthesis. A notable advantage of our approach is\nthat accurate results were achieved with a small training data set. Using an\natlas of a single CT and dual-echo UTE pair, we train a deep neural network\nmodel to learn the transform of MR intensities to CT using patches. We compared\nour CNN based model with a state-of-the-art registration based as well as a\nBayesian model based CT synthesis method, and showed that the proposed CNN\nmodel outperforms both of them. We also compared the proposed model when only\n$T_1$-w images are available instead of UTE, and show that UTE images produce\nbetter synthesis than using just $T_1$-w images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

For\nsparse matrix codes, array data dependence analysis is made more difficult by\nthe use of index arrays that make it possible to store only the nonzero entries\nof the matrix (e.g., in A[B[i]], B is an index array). Here, dependence\nanalysis is often stymied by such indirect array accesses due to the values of\nthe index array not being available at compile time. Consequently, many\ndependences cannot be proven unsatisfiable or determined until runtime.\nNonetheless, index arrays in sparse matrix codes often have properties such as\nmonotonicity of index array elements that can be exploited to reduce the amount\nof runtime analysis needed. In this paper, we contribute a formulation of array\ndata dependence analysis that includes encoding index array properties as\nuniversally quantified constraints. This makes it possible to leverage existing\nSMT solvers to determine whether such dependences are unsatisfiable and\nsignificantly reduces the number of dependences that require runtime analysis\nin a set of eight sparse matrix kernels.

Conditioning on these variables naively to\nestimate marginal effects may inappropriately block causal pathways and may\ninduce spurious associations between treatment and the outcome, leading to\nbias. To avoid such bias, researchers often use marginal structural models\n(MSMs) with inverse probability weighting (IPW). However, IPW requires models\nfor the conditional distributions of treatment and is highly sensitive to their\nmisspecification. Moreover, IPW is relatively inefficient, susceptible to\nfinite-sample bias, and difficult to use with continuous treatments. We\nintroduce an alternative method of constructing weights for MSMs, which we call\n\"residual balancing.\" In contrast to IPW, it requires modeling the conditional\nmeans of the post-treatment confounders rather than the conditional\ndistributions of treatment, and it is therefore easier to use with continuous\nexposures. Numeric simulations suggest that residual balancing is both more\nefficient and more robust to model misspecification than IPW and its variants.\nWe illustrate the method by estimating (a) the cumulative effect of negative\nadvertising on election outcomes and (b) the controlled direct effect of shared\ndemocracy on public support for war.

First, we create a\ndataset of political news articles and their reader comments from partisan news\nsites. Then, we train classifiers to predict different aspects of uncivil\nspeech in comments. We apply these classifiers to predict whether a news\narticle is likely to provoke a substantial portion of reader comments\ncontaining uncivil language by analyzing only the article's content. Finally,\nwe devise a technique to \"read between the lines\" --- finding the topics of\ndiscussions that an article triggers among its readers without frequent,\nexplicit mentions of these topics in its content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 03:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

In this\npaper, we revisit the problem of the station-level bike flow prediction, aiming\nto boost the prediction accuracy leveraging the breakthroughs of deep learning\ntechniques.

Besides numerous applications where this generic configuration\nis found, its main fundamental interest resides in the co-existence of a\nrecirculation bubble in the outlet and a pair of Dean vortices driven from\nwithin the turning part of the bend, and how their interaction may drive the\nflow dynamics. A critical point analysis first shows that the complex flow\ntopology that results from this particular configuration can be reduced to\nthree pairs of critical points in the symmetry plane of the bend (with a focus\nand a half-saddle each). These pairs respectively generate the first\nrecirculation bubble, the pair of Dean vortex tubes and a third pair of vortex\ntubes located in the upper corner of the bend, akin to the Dean vortices but of\nmuch lower intensity and impact on the rest of the flow. The Dean flow by\ncontrast drives a strong vertical jet that splits the recirculation bubble into\ntwo symmetric lobes. Unsteadiness sets in at $Re\\lesssim800$ through a\nsupercritical bifurcation, as these lobes start oscillating antisymmetrically.\nThese initially periodic oscillations grow in amplitude until the lobes break\naway from the main recirculation. The system then settles into a second\nperiodic state where streamwise vortices driven by the Dean flow are\nalternatively formed and shed on the left and right part of the outlet. This\nnovel mechanism of periodic vortex shedding results from the subtle interaction\nbetween the recirculation bubble in the outlet and the pair of Dean vortices\ngenerated in the turning part, and in this sense, they are expected to be a\nunique feature of the 180$^o$ bend with sufficiently close side walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 15:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

To combat the complexity of design choices,\nprior work has adopted the principle of modularized design which consists in\ndefining the network in terms of a composition of topologically identical or\nsimilar building blocks (a.k.a. modules). This reduces architecture search to\nthe problem of determining the number of modules to compose and how to connect\nsuch modules. Again, for reasons of design complexity and training cost,\nprevious approaches have relied on simple rules of connectivity, e.g.,\nconnecting each module to only the immediately preceding module or perhaps to\nall of the previous ones. Such simple connectivity rules are unlikely to yield\nthe optimal architecture for the given problem.\n  In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to\nlearn the connections between modules in the network. Instead of being chosen a\npriori by the human designer, the connectivity is learned simultaneously with\nthe weights of the network by optimizing the loss function of the end task\nusing a modified version of gradient descent. We demonstrate our connectivity\nlearning method on the problem of multi-class image classification using two\npopular architectures: ResNet and ResNeXt. Experiments on four different\ndatasets show that connectivity learning using our approach yields consistently\nhigher accuracy compared to relying on traditional predefined rules of\nconnectivity.

The frequency of such pulses decays with time as is quantified by\nthe {\\it braking index} ($n$). In the canonical model $n = 3$ for all pulsars,\nbut observational data show that $n \\neq 3$, indicating a limitation of the\nmodel. In this work we present a new approach to study the frequency decay of\nthe rotation of a pulsar, based on an adaptation of the canonical one. We\nconsider the pulsar a star that rotates in vacuum and has a strong magnetic\nfield but, differently from the canonical model, we assume that its moment of\ninertia changes in time due to a uniform variation of a displacement parameter\nin time. We found that the braking index results smaller than the canonical\nvalue as a consequence of an increase in the star's displacement parameter,\nwhose variation is small enough to allow plausible physical considerations that\ncan be applied to a more complex model for pulsars in the future. In\nparticular, this variation is of the order of neutron vortices' creep in\nrotating superfluids.

Linked color imaging (LCI)\nby laser endoscopy is a recently developed techniques, and its advantage in\nimproving the analysis accuracy of colorectal polyps over white-light (WL)\nendoscopy has been demonstrated in previous clinical studies. However, there\nare no objective criteria to evaluate and compare the aforementioned endoscopy\nmethods. This paper presents a new criterion, namely entropy of color gradients\nimage (ECGI), which is based on color gradients distribution and provides a\ncomprehensive and objective evaluating indicator of the performance of\ncolorectal images. Our method extracts the color gradient image pairs of 143\ncolonoscopy polyps in the LCI-PairedColon database, which are generated with WL\nand LCI conditions, respectively. Then, we apply the morphological method to\nfix the deviation of light-reflecting regions, and the ECGI scores of sample\npairs are calculated. Experimental results show that the average ECGI scores of\nLCI images (5.7071) were significantly higher than that of WL (4.6093). This\nobservation is consistent with the clinical studies.

The idea is as\nfollows: at each stage, a designated agent picks one object among those that\nremain. Another intuitive way to obtain an allocation is to give objects to\nagents in the first place, and to let agents exchange them as long as such\n\"deals\" are beneficial. This paper investigates these notions, when agents have\nadditive preferences over objects, and unveils surprising connections between\nthem, and with other efficiency and fairness notions. In particular, we show\nthat an allocation is sequenceable iff it is optimal for a certain type of\ndeals, namely cycle deals involving a single object. Furthermore, any\nPareto-optimal allocation is sequenceable, but not the converse. Regarding\nfairness, we show that an allocation can be envy-free and non-sequenceable, but\nthat every competitive equilibrium with equal incomes is sequenceable. To\ncomplete the picture, we show how some domain restrictions may affect the\nrelations between these notions. Finally, we experimentally explore the links\nbetween the scales of efficiency and fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 12:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}
