The purpose of this paper is to develop a standalone novel technique to\nsuppress motion artefacts from MR images using a data-driven deep learning\napproach. Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was\ndeveloped to remove motion artefacts in brain MR images. A CNN was trained on\nsimulated motion corrupted images to identify and suppress artefacts due to the\nmotion. The network was an encoder-decoder CNN architecture where the encoder\ndecomposed the motion corrupted images into a set of feature maps. The feature\nmaps were then combined by the decoder network to generate a motion-corrected\nimage. The network was tested on an unseen simulated dataset and an\nexperimental, motion corrupted in vivo brain dataset. Results: The trained\nnetwork was able to suppress the motion artefacts in the simulated motion\ncorrupted images, and the mean percentage error in the motion corrected images\nwas 2.69 % with a standard deviation of 0.95 %. The network was able to\neffectively suppress the motion artefacts from the experimental dataset,\ndemonstrating the generalisation capability of the trained network. Conclusion:\nA novel and generic motion correction technique has been developed that can\nsuppress motion artefacts from motion corrupted MR images. The proposed\ntechnique is a standalone post-processing method that does not interfere with\ndata acquisition or reconstruction parameters, thus making it suitable for a\nmultitude of MR sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 09:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

Thus, we also propose two group-sparse SVD models with\noverlapping group Lasso (OGL1-SVD) and overlapping group L0-norm penalty\n(OGL0-SVD). We first adopt an alternating iterative strategy to solve GL1-SVD\nbased on a block coordinate descent method, and GL0-SVD based on a projection\nmethod. The key of solving OGL1-SVD is a proximal operator with overlapping\ngroup Lasso penalty. We employ an alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) to solve the proximal operator. Similarly, we develop an approximate\nmethod to solve OGL0-SVD. Applications of these methods and comparison with\ncompeting ones using simulated data demonstrate their effectiveness.

Specifically, we investigate two\nessential ingredients of an intelligent nano receiver---modulation mode\ndetection (to differentiate between pulse based modulation and carrier based\nmodulation), and modulation classification (to identify the exact modulation\nscheme in use). To implement modulation mode detection, we construct a binary\nhypothesis test in nano-receiver's passband, and provide closed-form\nexpressions for the two error probabilities. As for modulation classification,\nwe aim to represent the received signal of interest by a Gaussian mixture model\n(GMM). This necessitates the explicit estimation of the THz channel impulse\nresponse, and its subsequent compensation (via deconvolution). We then learn\nthe GMM parameters via Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We then do Gaussian\napproximation of each mixture density to compute symmetric Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence in order to differentiate between various modulation schemes (i.e.,\n$M$-ary phase shift keying, $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation).

Experiments on the BraTS 2015 and 2017 datasets [1] show that: (1) the\nproposed method gives better performance than state-of-the-art methods in terms\nof established global evaluation metrics (e.g. PSNR), (2) replacing real MR\nvolumes with the synthesized MRI does not lead to significant degradation in\ntumour and sub-structure segmentation accuracy. The system further provides\nuncertainty estimates based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout [11] for the\nsynthesized volume at each voxel, permitting quantification of the system's\nconfidence in the output at each location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 19:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

The heterogeneity arises\nfrom prosumers' evaluation of energy contracts through multiple societal and\nenvironmental criteria and the prosumers' private preferences over those\ncriteria. The prosumers engage in bilateral negotiations with peers to mutually\nagree on periodical energy contracts/loans that consist of an energy volume to\nbe exchanged at that period and the return time of the exchanged energy. The\nprosumers keep an ordered preference profile of possible energy contracts by\nevaluating the contracts from their own valuations on the entailed criteria,\nand iteratively offer the peers contracts until an agreement is formed. A\nprosumer embeds the valuations into a utility function that further considers\nuncertainties imposed by demand and generation profiles. Empirical evaluation\non real demand, generation and storage profiles illustrates that the proposed\nnegotiation based strategy is able to increase the system efficiency (measured\nby utilitarian social welfare) and fairness (measured by Nash social welfare)\nover a baseline strategy and an individual flexibility control strategy.

In so doing we will, I hope, resolve the ontological problems that\ncome along with Quantum Theory.

The physicality condition (this ensures that\nprobabilities are between 0 and 1 and that choices in the future cannot effect\nthe past) is discussed in some detail in this part and also in an appendix. In\nthe fourth part of the paper I set out one particular conceptually driven\npossible road to Quantum Gravity.

Proposal-Recursive Bayes is intended for use\nwith hierarchical Bayesian models and uses a set of transient priors in first\nstage independent analyses of the data partitions.

Thus, the subjective quality of omnidirectional video may be\ncorrelated with HM and EM of human behavior. To fill in the gap between\nsubjective quality and human behavior, this paper proposes a large-scale visual\nquality assessment (VQA) dataset of omnidirectional video, called VQA-OV, which\ncollects 60 reference sequences and 540 impaired sequences. Our VQA-OV dataset\nprovides not only the subjective quality scores of sequences but also the HM\nand EM data of subjects. By mining our dataset, we find that the subjective\nquality of omnidirectional video is indeed related to HM and EM. Hence, we\ndevelop a deep learning model, which embeds HM and EM, for objective VQA on\nomnidirectional video. Experimental results show that our model significantly\nimproves the state-of-the-art performance of VQA on omnidirectional video.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 02:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

The coexistence of the SP and VP incidences\ndistinguishes such a near-field optical system from the ordinary optical\nsystem, in which only the VP (under the Coulomb gauge) incidence survives far\nfrom the light source. This fact is the motivation for equal treatment of the\nSP and VP as the cause of the response in the near-field optical system. In the\nsemiclassical treatment, the linear and nonlinear single susceptibilities are\nderived in the form of Heisenberg operators by the functional derivatives of\nthe action integral of the matter with respect to the SP and VP. These single\nsusceptibilities relate the SP and VP (as the cause) to the induced charge and\ncurrent densities (as the result), and guarantee charge conservation and gauge\ninvariance; this theory is free from gauge-fixing. It is necessary to consider\nthe quantum many-electron effect (exchange-correlation effect) to make the\nground state bounded in the non-perturbed system. This is done by employing the\nfundamental idea of density functional theory, instead of the ordinary unequal\ntreatment of the SP and VP, that is, remaking the SP into a Coulomb interaction\nbetween electron charges. Applying the present linear response theory to the\nnon-metallic material in a limited near-field optical system reveals that the\nelectric field with the associated permittivity is not suitable quantity to\ndescribe the response, instead, the SP and VP with associate single\nsusceptibility are essential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 02:35:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 08:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 12:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Their properties are still scarcely known.\n  Aims:We test the effectiveness of the selection criteria defined on the 4D\nEigenvector 1 (4DE1) for identifying xA sources. We provide a quantitative\ndescription of their UV spectra in the redshift range 2<z<2.9.\n  Methods:19 extreme quasar candidates were identified using 4DE1 selection\ncriteria applied to SDSS spectra: AlIII1860/SiIII]1892>0.5 and\nCIII]1909/SiIII]1892<1. The emission line spectra was studied using\nmulticomponent fits of deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the\nOSIRIS-GTC.\n  Results:Spectra confirm that almost all of these quasars are xA sources with\nvery similar properties. We provide spectrophotometric and line profile\nmeasurements for the SiIV1397+OIV]1402, CIV1549+HeII1640, and the 1900A blend\ncomposed by AlIII1860, SiIII]1892, FeIII and a weak CIII]1909. The spectra can\nbe characterized as very low ionization (logU~-3), a condition that explains\nthe significant FeIII emission. CIV1549 shows low equivalent width (<30 A for\nthe most sources), and high or extreme blueshift amplitudes (-5000<c(1/2)<-1000\nkms-1). Weak-lined quasars appear as extreme xA quasars and not as an\nindependent class. The CIV1549 high amplitude blueshifts coexists in all cases\nsave one with symmetric and narrower AlIII and SiIII] profiles. Estimates of\nthe Eddington ratio using the AlIII FWHM as a virial broadening estimator are\nconsistent with the ones of a previous xA sample.\n  Conclusions:It is now feasible to assemble large samples of xA quasars from\nthe latest data releases of the SDSS. We provide evidence that AlIII1860 could\nbe associated with a low-ionization virialized sub-system, supporting previous\nsuggestions that AlIII is a reliable virial broadening estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 06:13:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 12:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

For instance, in social systems\nindividuals can have social ties, family or financial relationships. In\nsettings where some units are exposed to a treatment and its effect spills over\nconnected units, estimating both the direct effect of the treatment and\nspillover effects presents several challenges. First, assumptions on the way\nand the extent to which spillover effects occur along the observed network are\nrequired. Second, in observational studies, where the treatment assignment is\nnot under the control of the investigator, confounding and homophily are\npotential threats to the identification and estimation of causal effects on\nnetworks. Here, we make two structural assumptions: i) neighborhood\ninterference, which assumes interference operates only through a function of\nthe immediate neighbors' treatments ii) unconfoundedness of the individual and\nneighborhood treatment, which rules out the presence of unmeasured confounding\nvariables, including those driving homophily. Under these assumptions we\ndevelop a new covariate-adjustment estimator for treatment and spillover\neffects in observational studies on networks.

We show how the BCB control for agents with the simplest\ndynamical model, i.e., the single-integrator dynamics, can be extended to\nagents with higher-order dynamics such as quadrotors, and nonholonomic agents\nsuch as unicycles and cars. Specifically, our extension preserves the desired\nconvergence and robustness guarantees of the BCB approach and is provably\nrobust to saturations in the input and unmodeled linear actuator dynamics for\nunicycle and car agents. We further show that under our proposed BCB control\ndesign, the agents can move along a rotated and scaled control direction\nwithout affecting the convergence to the desired formation. This observation is\nused to design a fully distributed collision avoidance strategy, which is often\nnot considered in the formation control literature. We demonstrate the proposed\napproach in simulations and further present a distributed robotic platform to\ntest the strategy experimentally. Our experimental platform consists of\noff-the-shelf equipment that can be used to test and validate other multi-agent\nalgorithms. The code and implementation instructions for this platform are\navailable online.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 13:51:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 18:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 15:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Thus, understanding its causes has become a\npriority of scholars across many disciplines. Here we demonstrate that shifts\nin socialization strategies analogous to political polarization and identity\npolitics can arise as a locally-beneficial response to both rising wealth\ninequality and economic decline. Adopting a perspective of cultural evolution,\nwe develop a framework to study the emergence of polarization under shifting\neconomic environments. In many contexts, interacting with diverse out-groups\nconfers benefits from innovation and exploration greater than those that arise\nfrom interacting exclusively with a homogeneous in-group. However, when the\neconomic environment favors risk-aversion, a strategy of seeking low-risk\ninteractions can be important to maintaining individual solvency. To capture\nthis dynamic, we assume that in-group interactions have a lower expected\noutcome, but a more certain one. Thus in-group interactions are less risky than\nout-group interactions. Our model shows that under conditions of economic\ndecline or increasing wealth inequality, some members of the population benefit\nfrom adopting a risk-averse, in-group favoring strategy. Moreover, we show that\nsuch in-group polarization can spread rapidly to the whole population and\npersist even when the conditions that produced it have reversed. Finally we\noffer empirical support for the role of income inequality as a driver of\naffective polarization in the United States, mirroring findings on a panel of\ndeveloped democracies. Our work provides a framework for studying how disparate\nforces interplay, via cultural evolution, to shape patterns of identity, and\nunifies what are often seen as conflicting explanations for political\npolarization: identity threat versus economic anxiety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 16:21:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 15:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

We show that because of noncommutativity the free fall accelerations\nof the Moon and the Earth toward the Sun in the case when the Moon and the\nEarth are at the same distance to the source of gravity are not the same even\nif gravitational and inertial masses of the bodies are equal. Therefore, the\nEotvos-parameter is not equal to zero and the weak equivalence principle is\nviolated in noncommutative phase space. We estimate the corrections to the\nEotvos-parameter caused by noncommutativity on the basis of Lunar laser ranging\nexperiment results.

In this prototype, the CRA is 3D-printed and coated with a metallic\nspray to easily introduce pseudo-random scatterers on the surface of a\ntraditional reflector antenna (TRA). The CRA performs a pseudo random coding of\nthe incident wavefront, thus adding spatial diversity in the imaging region and\nenabling the effective use of compressive sensing (CS) and imaging techniques.\nThe CRA is fed with a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar, which\nconsists of four transmitting and four receiving ports. Consequently, the\nmechanical scanning parts and phase shifters, which are necessary in\nconventional physical or synthetic aperture arrays, are not needed in this\nsystem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the prototype to perform\na successful 3D reconstruction of a T-shaped metallic target.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 18:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Although that prior\nwork demonstrated scaling, it did not demonstrate speedup, because it ran\nentirely in emulation. We took this as a challenge to construct a hardware\nprototype that embodies the ideas of ASC, but works on a broader range of\nprograms and runs natively on hardware. The resulting system is similar in\nspirit to the original work, but differs in practically every respect.\n  We present an implementation of the ASC architecture that runs natively on\nx86 hardware and achieves near-linear speedup up to 44-cores (the size of our\ntest platform) for several classes of programs, such as computational kernels,\nmap-style programs, and matrix operations. We observe that programs are either\ncompletely predictable, achieving near-perfect predictive accuracy, or totally\nunpredictable, and therefore not amenable to scaling via ASC-like techniques.\nWe also find that in most cases, speedup is limited only by implementation\ndetails: the overhead of our dependency tracking infrastructure and the\nmanipulation of large state spaces. We are able to automatically parallelize\nprograms with linked data structures that are not amenable to other forms of\nautomatic parallelization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 12:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}
