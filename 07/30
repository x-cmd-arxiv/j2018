Using precise astrometric measurements\nof the lensed position of a background source in combination with accurate\npredictions of the positions of the lens and the unlensed source it is possible\nto determine the mass of the lens with an accuracy of a few percent. Aims:\nMaking use of the recently published Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue, we\nwant to predict astrometric microlensing events caused by foreground stars with\nhigh proper motion passing a background source in the coming decades. Methods:\nWe selected roughly 148 000 high-proper-motion stars from Gaia DR2 with\n$\\mu_{tot} > 150\\,\\mathrm{mas/yr}$ as potential lenses. We then searched for\nbackground sources close to their paths. Using the astrometric parameters of\nGaia DR2, we calculated the future positions of source and lens. With a\nnested-intervals algorithm we determined the date and separation of the closest\napproach. Using Gaia DR2 photometry we determined an approximate mass of the\nlens, which we used to calculate the expected microlensing effects.

However, previous deep learning methods\nneed to pre-collect a large set of image pairs with/without synthesized rain\nfor training, which tends to make the neural network be biased toward learning\nthe specific patterns of the synthesized rain, while be less able to generalize\nto real test samples whose rain types differ from those in the training data.\nTo this issue, this paper firstly proposes a semi-supervised learning paradigm\ntoward this task. Different from traditional deep learning methods which only\nuse supervised image pairs with/without synthesized rain, we further put real\nrainy images, without need of their clean ones, into the network training\nprocess. This is realized by elaborately formulating the residual between an\ninput rainy image and its expected network output (clear image without rain) as\na specific parametrized rain streaks distribution. The network is therefore\ntrained to adapt real unsupervised diverse rain types through transferring from\nthe supervised synthesized rain, and thus both the short-of-training-sample and\nbias-to-supervised-sample issues can be evidently alleviated.

We first train our network using semi-synthetic data, generated\nfrom close talk speech recordings, and where we simulate the time delays and\ndistortion suffered in the signal that propagates from the source to the array\nof microphones. We then fine tune this network using a small amount of real\ndata. Our experimental results show that this strategy is able to produce\nnetworks that significantly improve existing localization methods based on\n\\textit{SRP-PHAT} strategies. In addition, our experiments show that our CNN\nmethod exhibits better resistance against varying gender of the speaker and\ndifferent window sizes compared with the other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 18:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-01"}

However, the task of breast cancer\nsegmentation in whole-slide images (WSIs) is still underexplored. WSIs are\nlarge histopathological images with extremely high resolution. Constrained by\nthe hardware and field of view, using high-magnification patches can slow down\nthe inference process and using low-magnification patches can cause the loss of\ninformation. In this paper, we aim to achieve two seemingly conflicting goals\nfor breast cancer segmentation: accurate and fast prediction. We propose a\nsimple yet efficient framework Reinforced Auto-Zoom Net (RAZN) to tackle this\ntask. Motivated by the zoom-in operation of a pathologist using a digital\nmicroscope, RAZN learns a policy network to decide whether zooming is required\nin a given region of interest. Because the zoom-in action is selective, RAZN is\nrobust to unbalanced and noisy ground truth labels and can efficiently reduce\noverfitting. We evaluate our method on a public breast cancer dataset. RAZN\noutperforms both single-scale and multi-scale baseline approaches, achieving\nbetter accuracy at low inference cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 21:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

When applied to the description of\nmolecular structures, persistent homology can capture the multiscale geometric\nfeatures and reveal certain interaction patterns in terms of topological\ninvariants. However, in addition to the geometric information, there is a wide\nvariety of non-geometric information of molecular structures, such as element\ntypes, atomic partial charges, atomic pairwise interactions, and electrostatic\npotential function, that is not described by persistent homology. Although\nelement specific homology and electrostatic persistent homology can encode some\nnon-geometric information into geometry based topological invariants, it is\ndesirable to have a mathematical framework to systematically embed both\ngeometric and non-geometric information, i.e., multicomponent heterogeneous\ninformation, into unified topological descriptions. To this end, we propose a\nmathematical framework based on persistent cohomology. In our framework,\nnon-geometric information can be either distributed globally or resided locally\non the datasets in the geometric sense and can be properly defined on\ntopological spaces, i.e., simplicial complexes. Using the proposed persistent\ncohomology based framework, enriched barcodes are extracted from datasets to\nrepresent heterogeneous information. We consider a variety of datasets to\nvalidate the present formulation and illustrate the usefulness of the proposed\npersistent cohomology.

In this\nproject, we wanted to relax the simplifying assumptions of a traditional neural\nnetwork by making a model that more closely emulates the low level interactions\nof neurons. Like in an RNN, our model has a state that persists between time\nsteps, so that the energies of neurons persist. However, unlike an RNN, our\nstate consists of a 2 dimensional matrix, rather than a 1 dimensional vector,\nthereby introducing a concept of distance to other neurons within the state. In\nour model, neurons can only fire to adjacent neurons, as in the brain. Like in\nthe brain, we only allow neurons to fire in a time step if they contain enough\nenergy, or excitement. We also enforce a notion of conservation of energy, so\nthat a neuron cannot excite its neighbors more than the excitement it already\ncontained at that time step. Taken together, these two features allow signals\nin the form of activations to flow around in our network over time, making our\nneural mesh more closely model signals traveling through the brain the brain.\nAlthough our main goal is to design an architecture to more closely emulate the\nbrain in the hope of having a correct internal representation of information by\nthe time we know how to properly train a general intelligence, we did benchmark\nour neural mash on a specific task.

This provides users with a direct,\nimmersive and intuitive interface for viewing and control. However, a typically\noverlooked factor in such designs is the latency introduced by the vehicle\ndynamics. As head motion is coupled with visual updates in such applications,\nvisual and control latency always exists between the issue of control commands\nby head movements and the visual feedback received at the completion of the\nattitude adjustment. This causes a discrepancy between the intended motion, the\nvestibular cue and the visual cue and may potentially result in simulator\nsickness. No research has been conducted on how various levels of visual and\ncontrol latency introduced by dynamics in robots or aerial vehicles affect\nusers' performance and the degree of simulator sickness elicited.

The Principle\nof Maximum Conformality (PMC) satisfies all of the principles of the\nrenormalization group and eliminates the scheme-and-scale ambiguities by the\nrecursive use of the renormalization group equation to determine the scale of\nthe QCD running coupling $\\alpha_s$ at each order.

Thus,\nthe resulting clustering framework is data-free, feature-free, similarity-free,\nand globally hierarchical---the four key features that distinguish it from\ncommon data clustering models such as $k$-means. Beyond a theoretical\nfoundation for abstraction, we also present a top-down and a bottom-up approach\nto establish an algorithmic foundation for practical abstraction-generating\nmethods. Lastly, via both a theoretical explanation and a real-world\napplication, we illustrate that further coupling of our abstraction framework\nwith statistics realizes Shannon's information lattice and even further, brings\nlearning into the picture. This not only presents one use case of our proposed\ncomputational abstraction, but also gives a first step towards a principled and\ncognitive way of automatic concept learning and knowledge discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 04:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 16:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

To help developers refactor code and improve\nsoftware quality, various tools were built to recommend clone-removal\nrefactorings based on the past and the present information, such as the\ncohesion degree of individual clones or the co-evolution relations of clone\npeers. The existence of these tools inspired us to build an approach that\nconsiders as many factors as possible to more accurately recommend clones. This\npaper introduces CREC, a learning-based approach that recommends clones by\nextracting features from the current status and past history of software\nprojects. Given a set of software repositories, CREC first automatically\nextracts the clone groups historically refactored (R-clones) and those not\nrefactored (NR-clones) to construct the training set. CREC extracts 34 features\nto characterize the content and evolution behaviors of individual clones, as\nwell as the spatial, syntactical, and co-change relations of clone peers. With\nthese features, CREC trains a classifier that recommends clones for\nrefactoring.\n  We designed the largest feature set thus far for clone recommendation, and\nperformed an evaluation on six large projects. The results show that our\napproach suggested refactorings with 83% and 76% F-scores in the within-project\nand cross-project settings.

In the SR-PCFs studied, the hollow core is surrounded by\na single ring of non-touching capillaries. Coupling between these capillaries\nresults in the formation of helical Bloch modes carrying orbital angular\nmomentum. In the twisted fiber, strong circular birefringence appears in the\nring, so that when a core mode with a certain circular polarization state (say\nLC) phase-matches to the ring, the other (RC) is strongly dephased.

Our framework, called Persistence Atlas, enables the\nvisualization of the dominant spatial patterns of critical points, along with\nstatistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas\nrepresents in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a\nconfidence map for the appearance of critical points. As a by-product, our\nmethod also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire ensemble, highlighting\nthe main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion of\nPersistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which\nleverages the robustness to noise of topological persistence to better\nemphasize salient features. We show how to leverage spectral embedding to\nrepresent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space,\nwhere distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical\npoint layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily\ncarried out. Further, we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be\nleveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence regions for the appearance of\ncritical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially\nparallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the\nconfidence regions provided by the persistence atlas is quantitatively\nevaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering\napproach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of\nreal-life datasets, where clear trends in feature layouts are identified and\nanalyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 07:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

These cold spots prevail the transport properties. Our\nresults indicate a strong $\\it{momentum}$ dependence of the scattering rates.\nWe also have indications that the scattering rates in correlated systems are\nfundamentally different from those in non-correlated materials because in the\nformer the Pauli principle is not operative.

Most of the current data assimilation algorithms consider the\nmodel and observation error terms as additive Gaussian noise, specified by\ntheir covariance matrices Q and R, respectively. These error covariances, and\nspecifically their respective amplitudes, determine the weights given to the\nbackground (i.e., the model forecasts) and to the observations in the solution\nof data assimilation algorithms (i.e., the analysis). Consequently, Q and R\nmatrices significantly impact the accuracy of the analysis. This review aims to\npresent and to discuss, with a unified framework, different methods to jointly\nestimate the Q and R matrices using ensemble-based data assimilation\ntechniques. Most of the methodologies developed to date use the innovations,\ndefined as differences between the observations and the projection of the\nforecasts onto the observation space. These methodologies are based on two main\nstatistical criteria: (i) the method of moments, in which the theoretical and\nempirical moments of the innovations are assumed to be equal, and (ii) methods\nthat use the likelihood of the observations, themselves contained in the\ninnovations. The reviewed methods assume that innovations are Gaussian random\nvariables, although extension to other distributions is possible for\nlikelihood-based methods. The methods also show some differences in terms of\nlevels of complexity and applicability to high-dimensional systems. The\nconclusion of the review discusses the key challenges to further develop\nestimation methods for Q and R. These challenges include taking into account\ntime-varying error covariances, using limited observational coverage,\nestimating additional deterministic error terms, or accounting for correlated\nnoises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 08:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 09:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 08:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:28:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 08:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

In the current work, we are focusing on the conversion\nprediction using brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging and clinical data, such as\ndemographics, cognitive assessments, genetic, and biochemical markers. First of\nall, we applied state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms on the neuroimaging\ndata and compared these results with two machine learning algorithms that we\nfit using the clinical data.

Commercially available FES\nproducts are open loop, meaning that the system is unable to adapt to changing\nconditions with the user and their muscles which results in muscle fatigue and\npoor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop\nbetween stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive\nstimulation. FES causes electrical artefacts which make it challenging to\nmonitor muscle contractions with traditional methods such as electromyography\n(EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with novel\nmechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during\nstimulation in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling\nrig with a software interface that enabled us to perform adaptive recording and\nstimulation, and then combine this with sensors to record forces applied to the\npedals using force sensitive resistors (FSRs), crank angle position using a\nmagnetic incremental encoder and inputs from the user using switches and a\npotentiometer.

It is\nthen shown that with a proper choice of velocity smoothing, SPH and large eddy\nsimulation (LES) equivalently solve the same set of filtered equations that\nrequire closure approximations. The only difference between SPH and LES, as\ndemonstrated in this paper is the representation of governing equations; for\nthe former the equations are in integro-differential form whereas for the\nlatter they are in differential form. One direct consequence of this\nequivalence between SPH and LES is that turbulence modeling techniques\noriginally developed for LES can easily be adopted into this version of SPH.\nOur representation of the sub-grid stress tensor in integral form will provide\ninsight into alternative approaches for dealing with turbulence modeling.\nAlthough the use of the Smagorinsky model is the common practice for turbulence\nmodeling in LES, it will be shown that for SPH the most natural choice is to\nuse approximate deconvolution methods. The other particularly fundamental\nconsequence of our choice of velocity smoothing is that the resulting filtered\nequations are nonconservative in nature and a correct Lagrangian cannot be\neasily constructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 09:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

This changes the definition of causality in the period\nof primordial cosmology. The prediction of stochastically quantised gravity is\nthat there will a transition from an oscillating quantum phase to a\nsemi-classical one, when the Lorentz time emerges.

The stochastic dynamic model is motivated by experimental findings of the\nmotion of a fruit fly around a given spot of food but shall generally describe\nlocal search behavior. The local search consists of a sequence of two epochs.\nIn the first the searcher explores new space around the home whereas it returns\nto the home during the second epoch. In the proposed two dimensional model both\ntasks are described by the same stochastic dynamics. The searcher moves with\nconstant speed and its angular dynamics is driven by a symmetric\n{\\alpha}-stable noise source. The latter stands for the uncertainty to decide\nthe new direction of motion. The main ingredient of the model is the nonlinear\ninteraction dynamics of the searcher with its home. In order to determine the\nnew heading direction, the angles of its position to the home and of the\nheading vector need to be known. A bound state to the home is realized by a\npermanent switch of a repulsive and attractive forcing of the heading direction\nfrom the position direction corresponding to search and return epochs. Our\ninvestigation elucidates the analytic tractability of the deterministic and\nstochastic dynamics. The noise enables a faster finding of a target distinct\nfrom the home with optimal intensity. This optimal situation is related to the\nnoise dependent relaxation time. It is uniquely defined for all {\\alpha} and\ndistinguishes between the stochastic dynamics before and after its value. For\ntimes large compared to this we derive the corresponding Smoluchowski equation\nand find diffusive spreading of searcher in the space. As result of its\nsimplicity the model aims to reproduce the local search behavior of simple\nunits during their exploration of surrounding space and their quasi-periodic\nreturn to a home.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 09:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Knowing how much time a system spends in each stage is crucial\nfor understanding how stars and associated planetary systems form, because a\nkey constraint is the time available to form such systems. Equally important is\nunderstanding what the spread in these time scales is. The most commonly used\nmethod for inferring protostellar ages is to assume the lifetime of one\nevolutionary stage, and then scale this to the relative number of protostars in\nthe other stages, i.e., assuming steady state. This method does not account for\nthe underlying age distribution and apparent stochasticity of star formation,\nnor that relative populations are not in steady state. To overcome this, we\npropose a new scheme where the lifetime of each protostellar stage follows a\ndistribution based on the formalism of sequential nuclear decay. The main\nassumptions are: Class 0 sources follow a straight path to Class III sources,\nthe age distribution follows a binomial distribution, and the star-formation\nrate is constant. The results are that the half-life of Class 0, Class I, and\nFlat sources are (2.4+/-0.2)%, (4.4+/-0.3)%, and (4.3+/-0.4)% of the Class II\nhalf-life, respectively, which translates to 47+/-4, 88+/-7, and 87+/-8 kyr,\nrespectively, for a Class II half-life of 2 Myr for protostars in the Gould\nBelt clouds with more than 100 protostars. The mean age of these clouds is\n1.2+/-0.1 Myr, and the star formation rate is (8.3+/-0.5)x10^-4 Msun/yr. The\ncritical parameters in arriving at these numbers are the assumed half-life of\nthe Class II stage, and the assumption that the star-formation rate and\nhalf-lives are constant. This method presents a first step in moving from\nsteady-state to non-steady-state solutions of protostellar populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 09:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

We show,\nusing general arguments, that parity violation and time-reversal odd\ncorrelations in the weak differential cross sections are generated from the\ninterference between different contributions to the hadronic current that are\nnot relatively real. Next, we present a detailed comparison of three, state of\nthe art, microscopic models for electroweak pion production off nucleons, and\nwe also confront their predictions with polarized electron data, as a test of\nthe vector content of these models.

By referencing\natomic transitions, frequency (and thus time) can be measured more precisely\nthan any other physical quantity, with the current generation of optical atomic\nclocks reporting fractional performance below the $10^{-17}$ level. However,\nthe theory of relativity prescribes that the passage of time is not absolute,\nbut impacted by an observer's reference frame. Consequently, clock measurements\nexhibit sensitivity to relative velocity, acceleration and gravity potential.\nHere we demonstrate optical clock measurements surpassing the present-day\nability to account for the gravitational distortion of space-time across the\nsurface of Earth. In two independent ytterbium optical lattice clocks, we\ndemonstrate unprecedented levels in three fundamental benchmarks of clock\nperformance.

We find\nthat the deformed sheet can be broadly divided into a uniaxially stretched\ncentral region and two clamp dominated side regions. A subregion characterized\nby a diverging stress can be identified at each of the four clamped-free\ncorners within the clamp dominated region. We postulate that the divergence at\nthe corners is regularized by nonlinear elastic deformations occurring in this\nsubregion at the very corners and provide a nontrivial scaling for its size.\nWithin the intermediate corner dominated subregion, measured displacements grow\nwith distance $r$ from the corners as $r^{\\alpha}$, with power $\\alpha < 1$\nconsistent with the development of stress singularities at the intersection of\nthe free and clamped edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 12:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

We compare these findings with\nour new cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations based on the EAGLE model that\nself-consistently vary the IMF on a per-particle basis such that it becomes\neither bottom-heavy (LoM-50) or top-heavy (HiM-50) in high-pressure\nenvironments. These simulations were calibrated to reproduce inferred IMF\nvariations such that the IMF becomes \"heavier\" due to either excess dwarf stars\nor stellar remnants, respectively, in galaxies with increasing stellar velocity\ndispersion. In agreement with observations, both simulations produce negative\nradial IMF gradients, transitioning from high to low excess mass-to-light ratio\n(MLE) at around $r_e$. We find negative metallicity radial gradients for both\nsimulations, but positive and flat [Mg/Fe] gradients in LoM-50 and HiM-50,\nrespectively. Measured in radial bins, the MLE increases strongly with local\nmetallicity for both simulations, in agreement with observations. However, the\nlocal MLE increases and decreases with local [Mg/Fe] in LoM-50 and HiM-50,\nrespectively. These qualitative differences can be used to break degeneracies\nin the manner with which the IMF varies in these high-mass ETGs. At $z=2$, we\nfind that the MLE has a higher and lower normalization for bottom- and\ntop-heavy IMF variations, respectively. We speculate that a hybrid of our LoM\nand HiM models may be able to reconcile observed IMF diagnostics in\nstar-forming galaxies and ETGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 12:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 16:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

This technique can rapidly acquire\nand index diffraction patterns to provide phase and orientation information\nabout the crystals on the material surface. The conventional analysis method\nuses signal processing based on a Hough/Radon transform to index each\ndiffraction pattern. This method is limited to the analysis of simple geometric\nfeatures and ignores subtle characteristics of diffraction patterns, such as\nvariations in relative band intensities. A second method, developed to address\nthe shortcomings of the Hough/Radon transform, is based on template matching of\na test experimental pattern with a large library of potential patterns. In the\npresent work, the template matching approach has been refined with a new cross\ncorrelation function that allows for a smaller library and enables a dramatic\nspeed up in pattern indexing. Refinement of the indexed orientation is\nperformed with a follow-up step to allow for small alterations to the best\nmatch from the library search. The orientation is further refined with rapid\nmeasurement of misorientation using whole pattern matching. The refined\ntemplate matching approach is shown to be comparable in accuracy, precision and\nsensitivity to the Hough based method, even exceeding it in some cases, via the\nuse of simulations and experimental data collected from a silicon single\ncrystal and a deformed {\\alpha}-iron sample.

However, the existing DCF paradigm suffers from\ntwo major issues, i.e., spatial boundary effect and temporal filter\ndegradation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a new DCF-based tracking\nmethod. The key innovations of the proposed method include adaptive spatial\nfeature selection and temporal consistent constraints, with which the new\ntracker enables joint spatial-temporal filter learning in a lower dimensional\ndiscriminative manifold. More specifically, we apply structured spatial\nsparsity constraints to multi-channel filers. Consequently, the process of\nlearning spatial filters can be approximated by the lasso regularisation. To\nencourage temporal consistency, the filter model is restricted to lie around\nits historical value and updated locally to preserve the global structure in\nthe manifold. Last, a unified optimisation framework is proposed to jointly\nselect temporal consistency preserving spatial features and learn\ndiscriminative filters with the augmented Lagrangian method.

However, the situation changes drastically in the\nmultipartite regime.

In order to cope with this problem we consider\nalternative resource theories in which we relax the class of LOCC to operations\nthat do not create entanglement.

Working on these results, we found a new redundancy in Laplaza's\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 15:51:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Promising results have been recently\nobtained with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when fed by raw speech\nsamples directly. Rather than employing standard hand-crafted features, the\nlatter CNNs learn low-level speech representations from waveforms, potentially\nallowing the network to better capture important narrow-band speaker\ncharacteristics such as pitch and formants. Proper design of the neural network\nis crucial to achieve this goal. This paper proposes a novel CNN architecture,\ncalled SincNet, that encourages the first convolutional layer to discover more\nmeaningful filters. SincNet is based on parametrized sinc functions, which\nimplement band-pass filters. In contrast to standard CNNs, that learn all\nelements of each filter, only low and high cutoff frequencies are directly\nlearned from data with the proposed method. This offers a very compact and\nefficient way to derive a customized filter bank specifically tuned for the\ndesired application.

In\nthis work, we propose the EventRelated Potential Encoder Network (ERPENet); a\nmulti-task autoencoder-based model, that can be applied to any ERP-related\ntasks. The strength of ERPENet lies in its capability to handle various kinds\nof ERP datasets and its robustness across multiple recording setups, enabling\njoint training across datasets. ERPENet incorporates Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), in an autoencoder setup,\nwhich tries to simultaneously compress the input EEG signal and extract related\nP300 features into a latent vector. Here, we can infer the process for\ngenerating the latent vector as universal joint feature extraction. The network\nalso includes a classification part for attended and unattended events\nclassification as an auxiliary task. We experimented on six different P300\ndatasets. The results show that the latent vector exhibits better compression\ncapability than the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised autoencoder\nmodel. For attended and unattended events classification, pre-trained weights\nare adopted as initial weights and tested on unseen P300 datasets to evaluate\nthe adaptability of the model, which shortens the training process as compared\nto using random Xavier weight initialization. At the compression rate of 6.84,\nthe classification accuracy outperforms conventional P300 classification\nmodels: XdawnLDA, DeepConvNet, and EEGNet achieving 79.37% - 88.52%\nclassification accuracy depending on the dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 07:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 12:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

These architectures provide programmers with the ability\nto reprogram the FPGAs for flexible acceleration of many workloads.\nNonetheless, this advantage is often overshadowed by the poor programmability\nof FPGAs whose programming is conventionally a RTL design practice. Although\nrecent advances in high-level synthesis (HLS) significantly improve the FPGA\nprogrammability, it still leaves programmers facing the challenge of\nidentifying the optimal design configuration in a tremendous design space.\n  This paper aims to address this challenge and pave the path from software\nprograms towards high-quality FPGA accelerators. Specifically, we first propose\nthe composable, parallel and pipeline (CPP) microarchitecture as a template of\naccelerator designs. Such a well-defined template is able to support efficient\naccelerator designs for a broad class of computation kernels, and more\nimportantly, drastically reduce the design space. Also, we introduce an\nanalytical model to capture the performance and resource trade-offs among\ndifferent design configurations of the CPP microarchitecture, which lays the\nfoundation for fast design space exploration. On top of the CPP\nmicroarchitecture and its analytical model, we develop the AutoAccel framework\nto make the entire accelerator generation automated. AutoAccel accepts a\nsoftware program as an input and performs a series of code transformations\nbased on the result of the analytical-model-based design space exploration to\nconstruct the desired CPP microarchitecture. Our experiments show that the\nAutoAccel-generated accelerators outperform their corresponding software\nimplementations by an average of 72x for a broad class of computation kernels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 06:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}
