Off disc-centre, the plasma flows orthogonal to\nthe granule tops begin to lie along the line-of-sight and those parallel to the\ngranule tops are no longer completely aligned with the observer. Moreover, the\ngranulation is corrugated and the granules can block other granules, as well as\nthe intergranular lane components.

Some algorithms required fixed size images as the input and\nhad low accuracy due to the underutilization of the noise residuals obtained by\nvarious types of filters. In this paper, we focus on designing an improved\nnetwork structure based on CNN to resolve the above problems. First, we use 3x3\nkernels instead of the traditional 5x5 kernels and optimize convolution kernels\nin the preprocessing layer. The smaller convolution kernels are used to reduce\nthe number of parameters and model the features in a small local region. Next,\nwe use separable convolutions to utilize channel correlation of the residuals,\ncompress the image content and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (between the\nstego signal and the image signal). Then, we use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)\nto aggregate the local features, enhance the representation ability of\nfeatures, and steganalyze arbitrary size image.

Once this is achieved,\nthe output of this network is used to train a Low-to-High GAN for image\nsuper-resolution using this time paired low- and high-resolution images. Our\nmain result is that this network can be now used to efectively increase the\nquality of real-world low-resolution images. We have applied the proposed\npipeline for the problem of face super-resolution where we report large\nimprovement over baselines and prior work although the proposed method is\npotentially applicable to other object categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 17:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-31"}

The main challenges overcome here include establishing relation\nbetween the PP property and discrete divergence of magnetic field on general\nmeshes, and estimating proper wave speeds in the HLL flux to ensure the PP\nproperty. In 1D case, we prove that the standard DG and finite volume methods\nwith the proposed HLL flux are PP, under condition accessible by a PP limiter.\nFor multidimensional conservative MHD system, standard DG methods with a PP\nlimiter are not PP in general, due to the effect of unavoidable\ndivergence-error.

We use both toy model and fully self-consistent simulations\nto show that the spirals develop naturally from vertical bending oscillations\nof a stellar disc. The underlying physics follows from the observation that the\nvertical energy of a star (essentially, its \"radius\" in the $z-v_z$ plane)\ncorrelates with its angular momentum or, alternatively, guiding radius.\nMoreover, at fixed physical radius, the guiding radius determines the azimuthal\nvelocity.

With a redshift of\nz=0.01098 and a peak apparent magnitude of B_{max}=14.31, ASASSN-18bt is the\nnearest and brightest SNe Ia yet observed by the Kepler spacecraft. Here we\npresent the discovery of ASASSN-18bt, the K2 light curve, and pre-discovery\ndata from ASAS-SN and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\n(ATLAS). The K2 early-time light curve has an unprecedented 30-minute cadence\nand photometric precision for an SN~Ia light curve, and it unambiguously shows\na ~4 day nearly linear phase followed by a steeper rise. Thus, ASASSN-18bt\njoins a growing list of SNe Ia whose early light curves are not well described\nby a single power law. We show that a double-power-law model fits the data\nreasonably well, hinting that two physical processes must be responsible for\nthe observed rise. However, we find that current models of the interaction with\na non-degenerate companion predict an abrupt rise and cannot adequately explain\nthe initial, slower linear phase. Instead, we find that existing, published\nmodels with shallow 56Ni are able to span the observed behavior and, with\ntuning, may be able to reproduce the ASASSN-18bt light curve. Regardless, more\ntheoretical work is needed to satisfactorily model this and other early-time\nSNe~Ia light curves.

For stress increments within the deviatoric pi-plane,\nthe irreversible response had rounded-corners, evidence of multiple plastic\nmechanisms. The response at these rounded corners varied in a continuous manner\nas a function of stress direction.

We confirm that the Star-Forming Main Sequence holds\nas a tight relation in this range of redshifts, and evolves strongly in both\nthe zero-point and slope. This evolution is different for the population of\nlocal star-forming (SFGs) and retired (RGs) galaxies, with the latter\npresenting a stronger evolution in the zero-point and a weaker evolution in the\nslope. The fraction of RGs decreases rapidly with z, particularly for those\nclassified as RGs at z~0. Contrary to previous studies we detect RGs well above\nz>1, although not all of them are progenitors of local RGs.

The goal of\nthis paper is to provide a fast heuristic to reasonably estimate quantities\nsuch as failure path and damage in the process of brittle failure. Towards this\ngoal, we first present a method to predict failure paths under tensile loading\nconditions and low-strain rates. The method uses a $k$-nearest neighbors\nalgorithm built on fracture process zone theory, and identifies the set of all\npossible pre-existing cracks that are likely to join early to form a large\ncrack. The method then identifies zone of failure and failure paths using\nweighted graphs algorithms. We compare these failure paths to those computed\nwith a high-fidelity model called the Hybrid Optimization Software Simulation\nSuite (HOSS). A probabilistic evolution model for average damage in a system is\nalso developed that is trained using 150 HOSS simulations and tested on 40\nsimulations. A non-parametric approach based on confidence intervals is used to\ndetermine the damage evolution over time along the dominant failure path. For\nupscaling, damage is the key QoI needed as an input by the continuum models.\nThis needs to be informed accurately by the surrogate models for calculating\neffective modulii at continuum-scale. We show that for the proposed average\ndamage evolution model, the prediction accuracy on the test data is more than\n90\\%. In terms of the computational time, the proposed models are $\\approx\n\\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ times faster compared to high-fidelity HOSS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 19:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

In between the outgoing pulses, the radar measures the signal\nreflected from the targets to determine their presence, range, velocity and\nother characteristics. Radar systems face multiple challenges, generating many\ntrade-offs such as bandwidth versus range resolution and dwell time versus\nDoppler resolution. In MIMO radar, high resolution requires a large aperture\nand high number of antennas, increasing hardware and processing requirements.\n  Recently, novel approaches in sampling theory and radar signal processing\nhave been proposed to allow target detection and parameter recovery from\nsamples obtained below the Nyquist rate. These techniques exploit the sparsity\nof the target scene in order to reduce the required number of samples, pulses\nand antennas, breaking the link between bandwidth, dwell time and number of\nantennas on the one hand and range, Doppler and azimuth resolution,\nrespectively, on the other.\n  This review introduces this so-called sub-Nyquist radar paradigm and\ndescribes the corresponding sampling and recovery algorithms, that leverage\ncompressed sensing techniques to perform time and spatial compression.

In this work we present an easy to use\nsoftware tool which allows researchers and clinicians to design dielectric pads\nefficiently on standard computer systems, for 7T neuroimaging and 3T body\nimaging applications. Methods: The tool incorporates advanced computational\nmethods based on field decomposition and model order reduction as a framework\nto efficiently evaluate the B1+ fields resulting from dielectric pads.

In fact, we argue that a proper interpretation of the procedures\ninvolved in a physical determination of $\\kappa_S$ does not necessarily lead to\n$\\kappa_S=0$. In order to show this we consider a mono-chromatic source of\nphotons prepared in an {\\it arbitrary} quantum state and a simple version of\nthe well-established photon detection theory of Glauber which, by construction,\nobeys all the rules of quantum mechanics. It is, however, also argued that\nafter a proper identification of the relevant quantum-mechanical probability\namplitudes one can be reach $\\kappa_S=0$. As long as one only consider a single\nphoton detector, it is verified that, in this context, there is no fundamental\ndifference between quantum-mechanical interference and interference as\nexpressed in terms of classical electro-magnetic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 21:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often used to explore the\nposterior distribution for model parameters, but, due to the high correlations\nbetween parameters, nonlinearity, and potential multi-modality in the\nposterior, many samplers perform very inefficiently.

These\nsubtleties, reflections of topological quantum anomalies (for any\ndimensionality, for both Schrodinger and Dirac/Weyl Hamiltonians and for either\ncontinuous or lattice (tight-binding) models) can always be written as global\nfluxes of certain generalized current densities Jg.

Examples are provided where such\nnon-Hermiticities have a direct physical significance (for both conventional\nand topological materials). In all examples considered, these non-Hermitian\nboundary terms turn out to be quantized, the quantization being either of\nconventional or of a topological (Quantum Hall Effect (QHE))-type. The latter\nclaim is substantiated through application to a simple QHE arrangement (2D\nLandau system in an external in-plane electric field), where some particular Jg\nis related to the well-known edge currents.

The\nsmall discrepancies in number densities of negative hydrogen ions, positive\nions, as well as hydrogen atoms can be attributed to the differences in the\npredicted electron number density for given discharge power. Higher electron\nnumber density obtained with GMNHIS is possibly due to fewer dissociation\nchannels accounted for in GMNHIS, leading to smaller energy loss.

In this paper, we\naddress the physical-layer security in a cooperative wireless subnetwork that\nincludes a source-destination pair and multiple relays, exchanging information\nin the presence of a malevolent eavesdropper. Specifically, the eavesdropper is\nactive in the network and transmits artificial noise (AN) with a\nmultiple-antenna transmitter to confound both the relays and the destination.\nWe first analyse the secrecy capacity of the direct source-to-destination\ntransmission in terms of intercept probability (IP) and secrecy outage\nprobability (SOP). A decode-and-forward incremental relaying (IR) protocol is\nthen introduced to improve reliability and security of communications in the\npresence of the active eavesdropper. Within this context, and depending on the\navailability of channel state information, three different schemes (one optimal\nand two sub-optimal) are proposed to select a trusted relay to improve the\nachievable secrecy rate. For each one of these schemes, and for both selection\nand maximum ratio combining at the destination and eavesdropper, we derive new\nand exact closed-form expressions for the IP and SOP. Our analysis and\nsimulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nIR-based selection schemes for secure communication. They also confirm the\nexistence of a floor phenomenon for the SOP in the absence of AN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:12:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 22:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-21"}

Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and\nimprove mobile CNNs on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balance\nthese trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to\nconsider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecture\nsearch (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into the\nmain objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good\ntrade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency is\nconsidered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approach\ndirectly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile\nphones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search\nspace size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that\nencourages layer diversity throughout the network.

A keyfob is a key with a secure hardware that\ncommunicates and authenticates the vehicle over the wireless channel.\nConventionally, a vehicle to keyfob authentication is realized through a\nchallenge-response verification protocol. An authentic coupling between the\nvehicle identity and the keyfob avoids any illegal access to the vehicle.\nHowever, these authentication messages can be relayed by an active adversary,\nthereby, can amplify the actual distance between an authentic vehicle and a\nkeyfob. Eventually, an adversary can possibly gain access to the vehicle by\nrelaying wireless signals and without any effort to generate or decode the\nsecret credentials. Hence, the vehicle to keyfob authentication scheme must\ncontain an additional attribute verification such as physical movement of a\nkeyfob holder.\n  Our solution is a two-party and three-way handshake scheme with proactive and\nreactive commitment verification. The proposed solution also uses a time\ninterval verification such that both vehicle and keyfob would yield a similar\nlocomotion pattern of a dynamic keyfob within a similar observational time\ninterval. Hence, the solution is different from the distance bounding protocols\nthat require multiple iterations for the round-trip delay measurement.

As a consequence,\nthis new tool enables us to evaluate the singular value spectrum of the\ninput-output Jacobian of a fully-connected deep ResNet for both linear and\nnonlinear cases. With the powerful tool of free probability, we conduct an\nasymptotic analysis of the spectrum on the single-layer case, and then extend\nthis analysis to the multi-layer case of an arbitrary number of layers. In\nparticular, we propose to rescale the classical random initialization by the\nnumber of residual units, so that the spectrum has the order of $O(1)$, when\ncompared with the large width and depth of the network. We empirically\ndemonstrate that the proposed initialization scheme learns at a speed of orders\nof magnitudes faster than the classical ones, and thus attests a strong\npractical relevance of this investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 07:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 10:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 09:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

Robots should be able to deal with unknown\nenvironments, recognize objects and use them in the correct way, so it is\nimportant to explore the domain adaptation scenario also in this context. The\ngoal of the project is to define a benchmark and a protocol for multi-modal\ndomain adaptation that is valuable for the robot vision community. With this\npurpose some of the state-of-the-art DA methods are selected: Deep Adaptation\nNetwork (DAN), Domain Adversarial Training of Neural Network (DANN), Automatic\nDomain Alignment Layers (AutoDIAL) and Adversarial Discriminative Domain\nAdaptation (ADDA).

Although many\nsemi-supervised methods have been proposed to provide extra training data,\nautomatically generated labels are usually too noisy to retrain models\neffectively. In this paper, we propose a Two-Stream Mutual Attention Network\n(TSMAN) that weakens the influence of back-propagated gradients caused by\nincorrect labels, thereby rendering the network robust to unclean data. The\nproposed TSMAN consists of two sub-networks that are connected by three types\nof attention models in different layers. The target of each attention model is\nto indicate potentially incorrect gradients in a certain layer for both\nsub-networks by analyzing their inferred features using the same input. In\norder to achieve this purpose, the attention models are designed based on the\npropagation analysis of noisy gradients at different layers. This allows the\nattention models to effectively discover incorrect labels and weaken their\ninfluence during the parameter updating process. By exchanging multi-level\nfeatures within the two-stream architecture, the effects of noisy labels in\neach sub-network are reduced by decreasing the updating gradients. Furthermore,\na hierarchical distillation is developed to provide more reliable pseudo labels\nfor unlabelded data, which further boosts the performance of our retrained\nTSMAN.

However, current evaluation methods simply focus only on\ncoarse-grained evaluation where the focus is on retrieving images which belong\nto the same class as the sketch but not necessarily having the same shape\ncharacteristics as in the sketch.

When the ionic lattice becomes sufficiently\nstrong the spectral weight peaks broaden, denoting a gradual disappearance of\nthe Fermi surface along the symmetry breaking direction. This phenomenon occurs\neven in the absence of spontaneously generated stripes. The resulting Fermi\nsurface appears to consist of detached segments reminiscent of Fermi arcs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 09:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 19:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

While so far largely\nunexplored, such probes are set to rise dramatically in importance as upcoming\nsurveys provide data of unprecedented quantity and quality on galaxy structure\nand dynamics. In this paper, we use warping of stellar disks to test the\nchameleon- or symmetron-screened fifth forces which generically arise when new\nfields couple to matter. We take r-band images of mostly late-type galaxies\nfrom the Nasa Sloan Atlas and develop an automated algorithm to quantify the\ndegree of U-shaped warping they exhibit.

This fact has gathered attention\nof investors around the world and revived the discussion of proper modeling and\nforecasting yield curve, since changes in interest rate structure are believed\nto represent investors expectations about the future state of economy and have\nforeshadowed recessions in the United States. While changes in term structure\nof interest rates are relatively easy to interpret they are however very\ndifficult to model and forecast due to no proper economic theory underlying\nsuch events. Yield curves are usually represented by multivariate sparse time\nseries, at any point in time infinite dimensional curve is portrayed via\nrelatively few points in a multivariate space of data and as a consequence\nmultimodal statistical dependencies behind these curves are relatively hard to\nextract and forecast via typical multivariate statistical methods.We propose to\nmodel yield curves via reconstruction of joint probability distribution of\nparameters in functional space as a high degree polynomial.

Major warmings occur roughly every second winter in the\nNorthern Hemisphere (NH), but has only been observed once in the Southern\nHemisphere (SH), during the Antarctic winter of 2002. Observations by the\nGlobal Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS, an instrument on board\nEnvisat) during this rare event, show a 40% increase of ozone in the nighttime\nsecondary ozone layer at subpolar latitudes compared to non-SSW years. This\nstudy investigates the cause of the mesospheric nighttime ozone increase, using\nthe National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community\nClimate Model with specified dynamics (SD-WACCM). The 2002 SH winter was\ncharacterized by several reductions of the strength of the polar night jet in\nthe upper stratosphere before the jet reversed completely, marking the onset of\nthe major SSW. At the time of these wind reductions, corresponding episodic\nincreases can be seen in the modelled nighttime secondary ozone layer. This\nozone increase is attributed largely to enhanced upwelling and the associated\ncooling of the altitude region in conjunction with the wind reversal. This is\nin correspondence to similar studies of SSW induced ozone enhancements in NH.\nBut unlike its NH counterpart, the SH secondary ozone layer appeared to be\nimpacted less by episodic variations in atomic hydrogen. Seasonally decreasing\natomic hydrogen plays however a larger role in SH compared to NH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 10:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

The library is based on OpenFOAM and enhances the general-purpose LES\nsolvers provided by this software with state-of-the-art wall modelling\ncapability.

To demonstrate the capabilities of the library, it was\nused for WMLES of turbulent channel flow and the flow over a backward-facing\nstep (BFS).

Such designs may\ninduce dependence between the sampled units; for example, with employment of a\nsampling step that selects geographically-indexed clusters of units. A\nsampling-weighted pseudo-posterior distribution may be used to estimate the\npopulation model on the observed sample.

Algorithms can be thought of as mathematical operators (called\nprocesses), with input, output and parameters, and they may be chained one\nafter another easily and efficiently. Also for efficiency, processes can have\ntheir initialization work split from their core workload, so process chains and\nloops do not incur in performance penalties.

The parallelization strategy here\nproposed aims to take advantage of the enhanced complexity of a dual-grid\ncoupling to gain more flexibility in the domain partitioning while keeping a\nlow inter-process communication cost. In particular, it allows avoiding inter-\nprocess communication between CFD and DEM software and still allows adopting\ncomplex partitioning strategies thanks to an optimized grid-based\ncommunication.

Motivated by this result we performed time-resolved imaging\npolarimetry of Phaethon during its recent close approach to the Earth. Phaethon\nhas a spin period of 3.604 hours and we found a variation of the linear\npolarisation with rotation. This seems to be a rare case in which such\nvariation is unambiguously found, also a consequence of its fairly large\namplitude. Combining this new information with the brightness and colour\nvariation, as well as previously reported results from Arecibo radar\nobservations, we conclude that there is no variation of the mineralogy across\nthe surface of Phaeton. However, the observed change in the linear polarisation\nmay be related to differences in the thickness of the surface regolith in\ndifferent areas or local topographic features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Typical examples include wound healing, cancer growth and embryo\ndevelopment. In these crowded environments cells are able to interact with each\nother in a variety of ways. These include excluded volume interactions,\nadhesion, repulsion, cell signalling, pushing and pulling. One popular way to\nunderstand the behaviour of a group of interacting cells is through an\nagent-based model (ABM). A typical aim of modellers using such represtations is\nto elucidate how the microscopic interactions at the cell-level impact on the\nmacroscopic behaviour of the population. The complex cell-cell interactions\nlisted above have also been incorporated into such models; all apart from\ncell-cell pulling. In this paper we consider this under-represented cell-cell\ninteraction, in which an active cell is able to `pull' a nearby neighbour as it\nmoves. We incorporate a variety of potential cell-cell pulling mechanisms into\non- and off-lattice agent-based volume exclusion models of cell movement. For\neach of these agent-based models we derive a continuum partial differential\nequation which describes the evolution of the cells at a population-level. We\nstudy the agreement between the ABMs and the continuum, population-based\nmodels, and compare and contrast a range of ABMs (accounting for the different\npulling mechanisms) with each other. We find generally good agreement between\nthe ABMs and the corresponding continuum models that worsens as the agent-based\nmodels become more complex. Interestingly, we observe that the partial\ndifferential equations that we derive differ significantly, depending on\nwhether they were derived from on- or off-lattice ABMs of pulling.

The droplets are subject to turbulence as well\nas gravity, and their collision and coalescence efficiencies are taken to be\nunity. We solve the thermodynamic equations governing temperature, water-vapor\nmixing ratio, and the resulting supersaturation fields together with the\nNavier-Stokes equation. We find that the droplet-size distribution broadens\nwith increasing Reynolds number and/or mean energy dissipation rate. Turbulence\naffects the condensational growth directly through supersaturation\nfluctuations, and it influences collisional growth indirectly through\ncondensation. Our simulations show for the first time that, in the absence of\nthe mean updraft cooling, supersaturation fluctuation-induced broadening of\ndroplet-size distributions enhances the collisional growth. This is contrary to\nclassical (non-turbulent) condensational growth, which leads to a growing mean\ndroplet size, but a narrower droplet-size distribution.

Around 30\\% of the young\nhigh-mass stars in the Galaxy are observed at the edges of ionized (HII)\nregions. Therefore these are places of choice to study the earliest stages of\nhigh-mass star formation, especially towards the most massive condensations.\nHigh-spatial resolution observations in the millimeter range might reveal how\nthese stars form and how they assemble their mass. We want to study the\nfragmentation process down to the 0.01~pc scale in the most massive\ncondensation observed at the south-western edge of the HII region RCW~120 where\nthe most massive Herschel cores ($\\sim$124~$M_{\\odot}$ in average) could form\nhigh-mass stars. Using ALMA 3~mm continuum observations towards the densest and\nmost massive millimetric condensation (Condensation 1) of RCW~120, we used the\ngetimages and getsources algorithms to extract the sources detected with ALMA\nand obtained their physical parameters. The fragmentation of the hersche cores\nis discussed through their Jeans mass to understand the properties of the\nfuture stars. We extracted 18 fragments from the ALMA continuum observation at\n3~mm towards 8 cores detected with Herschel, whose mass and deconvolved size\nrange from 2~$M_{\\odot}$ to 32~$M_{\\odot}$ and from 1.6~mpc to 28.8~mpc,\nrespectively. The low degree of fragmentation observed, regarding to the\nthermal Jeans fragmentation, suggests that the observed fragmentation is\ninconsistent with ideal gravitational fragmentation and other ingredients such\nas turbulence or magnetic fields should be added in order to explain it.\nFinally, the range of fragments' mass indicates that the densest condensation\nof RCW~120 is a favourable place for the formation of high-mass stars with the\npresence of a probable UCHII region associated with the 27~$M_{\\odot}$ Fragment\n1 of Core 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 15:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

For incompressible flow problems, RBMs\nbased on LBB stable velocity-pressure spaces do not generally inherit the\nstability of the underlying high-fidelity model and, instead, additional\nstabilization techniques must be introduced. One way of bypassing the loss of\nLBB stability in the RBM is to inflate the velocity space with supremizer\nmodes. This however deteriorates the performance of the RBM in the\nperformance-critical online stage, as additional DOFs must be introduced to\nretain stability, while these DOFs do not effectively contribute to accuracy of\nthe RB approximation. In this work we consider a velocity-only RB\napproximation, exploiting a solenoidal velocity basis. The solenoidal reduced\nbasis emerges directly from the high-fidelity velocity solutions in the offline\nstage. By means of Piola transforms, the solenoidality of the velocity space is\nretained under geometric transformations, making the proposed RB method\nsuitable also for the investigation of geometric parameters. To ensure exact\nsolenoidality of the high-fidelity velocity solutions that constitute the RB,\nwe consider approximations based on divergence-conforming compatible B-splines.\nWe show that the velocity-only RB method leads to a significant improvement in\ncomputational efficiency in the online stage, and that the pressure solution\ncan be recovered a posteriori at negligible extra cost.

DCNNs are typically resource-intensive\nand too large to be deployed on portable devices, thus this limits the\npractical application of complex activity detection. In addition, since\nportable devices do not possess high-performance Graphic Processing Units\n(GPUs), there is hardly any improvement in Action Game (ACT) experience.\nBesides, in order to deal with multi-sensor collaboration, all previous human\nactivity recognition models typically treated the representations from\ndifferent sensor signal sources equally.

This scheme is used to train 2-bit Convolutional Neural Networks with\nweights and activations constrained to {-0.5,0,0.5}. It takes into account the\ncorrelation between different sensor signal sources and the activity types.\nThis model, which we refer to as DFTerNet, aims at producing a more reliable\ninference and better trade-offs for practical applications.

I propose a novel\npixel technology for dynamic micro-displays with novel capabilities such as (1)\nEach submicron pixel being operable electrically yet independently (i.e. the\nability of turning a pixel on/off being independent from the neighboring\npixels, hence the infinite contrast ratio. (2) Highly directional light being\nemitted from each pixel and (3) Increased quantum yield and luminescence while\ndecreasing the number of QDs per pixel, hence minimizing the power consumption\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 08:51:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}
