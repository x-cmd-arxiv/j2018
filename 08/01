A multilayer interdependent network consists of a set of\ngraphs $G$ that are interconnected through a weighted interconnection matrix $\nB $, where the weight of each inter-graph link is a non-negative real number $\np $. Various dynamical processes, such as synchronization, cascading failures\nin power grids, and diffusion processes, are described by the Laplacian matrix\n$ Q $ characterizing the whole system. For the case in which the multilayer\ngraph is a multiplex, where the number of nodes in each layer is the same and\nthe interconnection matrix $ B=pI $, being $ I $ the identity matrix, it has\nbeen shown that there exists a structural transition at some critical coupling,\n$ p^* $. This transition is such that dynamical processes are separated into\ntwo regimes: if $ p > p^* $, the network acts as a whole; whereas when $ p<p^*\n$, the network operates as if the graphs encoding the layers were isolated. In\nthis paper, we extend and generalize the structural transition threshold $ p^*\n$ to a regular interconnection matrix $ B $ (constant row and column sum).\nSpecifically, we provide upper and lower bounds for the transition threshold $\np^* $ in interdependent networks with a regular interconnection matrix $ B $\nand derive the exact transition threshold for special scenarios using the\nformalism of quotient graphs. Additionally, we discuss the physical meaning of\nthe transition threshold $ p^* $ in terms of the minimum cut and show, through\na counter-example, that the structural transition does not always exist.

Until now, most investigations of\nthe directional characteristics of millimeter-wave channels have used\nmechanically rotating horn antennas. In contrast, the sounder presented here is\ncapable of performing horizontal and vertical beam steering with the help of\nphased arrays. Due to its fast beam-switching capability, the proposed sounder\ncan perform measurements that are directionally resolved both at the\ntransmitter(TX) and receiver (RX) in 1.44 milliseconds compared to the minutes\nor even hours required for rotating horn antenna sounders. This not only\nenables measurement of more TX-RX locations for a better statistical validity\nbut also allows to perform directional analysis in dynamic environments. The\nshort measurement time combined with the high phase stability limits the phase\ndrift between TX and RX, enabling phase-coherent sounding of all beam pairs\neven when TX and RX have no cabled connection for synchronization without any\ndelay ambiguity. Furthermore, the phase stability over time enables complex RX\nwaveform averaging to improve the signal to noise ratio during high path loss\nmeasurements.

In the standard picture, this protection is guaranteed by a high\ndegree of spatial nonlocality of the Majoranas, namely a suppressed\nwave-function overlap, in the topological phase. However, a careful\ncharacterisation of resilience to local noise goes beyond mere spatial\nseparation, and must also take into account the projection of wave-function\nspin. By considering the susceptibility of a given zero mode to different local\nperturbations, we find the relevant forms of spin-resolved wave-function\noverlaps that measure its resilience. We quantify these overlaps and study\ntheir dependence with nanowire parameters in several classes of experimentally\nrelevant configurations. These include nanowires with inhomogeneous depletion\nand induced pairing, barriers and quantum dots. Smooth inhomogeneities have\nbeen shown to produce near-zero modes, so-called pseudo-Majoranas, below the\ncritical Zeeman field in the bulk. Surprisingly, their resilience is found to\nbe comparable or better than that of topological Majoranas in realistic\nsystems. We further study how accurately their overlaps can be estimated using\na purely local measurement on one end of the nanowire, accessible through\nconventional transport experiments. In uniform nanowires this local estimator\nis remarkably accurate. In inhomogeneous cases it is less accurate but can\nstill provide reasonable estimates for potential inhomogeneities of the order\nof the superconducting gap. We further analyse the zero mode wave-function\nstructure, spin texture and spectral features associated with each type of\ninhomogeneity. All our results highlight the strong connection between internal\nwave-function degrees of freedom, nonlocality and protection in smoothly\ninhomogeneous nanowires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 17:09:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 10:08:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 10:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The most general discriminator is one who tests the\nchannels in a sequential manner, one after the other, and this discriminator is\nknown as a quantum tester [Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev.

We\nformalize this problem within the full-information adversarial bandit\nframework, where we evaluate the capability of an algorithm to select mixtures\nof discriminators for providing the generator with feedback during learning. To\nthis end, we propose a reward function which reflects the progress made by the\ngenerator and dynamically update the mixture weights allocated to each\ndiscriminator. We also draw connections between our algorithm and stochastic\noptimization methods and then show that existing approaches using multiple\ndiscriminators in literature can be recovered from our framework. We argue that\nless expressive discriminators are smoother and have a general coarse grained\nview of the modes map, which enforces the generator to cover a wide portion of\nthe data distribution support. On the other hand, highly expressive\ndiscriminators ensure samples quality. Finally, experimental results show that\nour approach improves samples quality and diversity over existing baselines by\neffectively learning a curriculum. These results also support the claim that\nweaker discriminators have higher entropy improving modes coverage.

Over the last several years, three formal\ndefinitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification,\nmeaning that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their proxies---are\nnot explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that\ncommon measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false\nnegative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes;\nand (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are\nindependent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these\nfairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring\nanti-classification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very\ngroups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally\ndesirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast\nto these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to\ntreat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically\naccurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not\nuniversally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this\nstrategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification\nparity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk\nestimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to\navoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally\naddress these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular\nmathematical formalizations of fairness. By highlighting these challenges in\nthe foundation of fair machine learning, we hope to help researchers and\npractitioners productively advance the area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 18:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 17:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

We compute and achieve a relative currency order among records\nderived from given currency constraints, according to which inconsistent and\nincomplete data can be repaired effectively considering the temporal impact.\nFor both effectiveness and efficiency consideration, we carry out inconsistent\nrepair ahead of incomplete repair.

The proposed approach leverages the complementary strengths\nof both deep learning and analytical acoustic modelling (filtering based\napproach) as compared to recently published, comparatively simpler benchmark\napproaches that rely only on deep learning. The proposed audio-visual (AV)\nspeech enhancement framework operates at two levels. In the first level, a\nnovel deep learning-based lip-reading regression model is employed. In the\nsecond level, lip-reading approximated clean-audio features are exploited,\nusing an enhanced, visually-derived Wiener filter (EVWF), for the clean audio\npower spectrum estimation. Specifically, a stacked long-short-term memory\n(LSTM) based lip-reading regression model is designed for clean audio features\nestimation using only temporal visual features considering different number of\nprior visual frames. For clean speech spectrum estimation, a new\nfilterbank-domain EVWF is formulated, which exploits estimated speech features.\nThe proposed EVWF is compared with conventional Spectral Subtraction and\nLog-Minimum Mean-Square Error methods using both ideal AV mapping and LSTM\ndriven AV mapping. The potential of the proposed speech enhancement framework\nis evaluated under different dynamic real-world commercially-motivated\nscenarios (e.g. cafe, public transport, pedestrian area) at different SNR\nlevels (ranging from low to high SNRs) using benchmark Grid and ChiME3 corpora.\nFor objective testing, perceptual evaluation of speech quality is used to\nevaluate the quality of restored speech. For subjective testing, the standard\nmean-opinion-score method is used with inferential statistics. Comparative\nsimulation results demonstrate significant lip-reading and speech enhancement\nimprovement in terms of both speech quality and speech intelligibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 19:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

We present three different methods for computing\nthe angular momentum loss in the solar wind. Two are based on MHD simulations\nfrom Finley & Matt (2018), with one using the open flux measured in the solar\nwind, and the other using remotely-observed surface magnetograms.

It consists of two components: 1) a measure for feature\nsubset evaluation, and 2) a search strategy. For the evaluation measure, we\nhave employed the fuzzy-rough dependency degree (FRFDD) in the lower\napproximation-based fuzzy-rough feature selection (L-FRFS) due to its\neffectiveness in feature selection.

In this paper, we systematically\nstudy the prospects of testing general relativity with such black hole-pulsar\nbinaries. We begin by finding a mapping between generic non-Einsteinian\nparameters in the orbital decay rate and theoretical constants in various\nmodified theories of gravity and then summarize this mapping with a\nready-to-use list. Theories we study here include scalar-tensor theories,\nvarying $G$ theories, massive gravity theories, generic screening gravity and\nquadratic curvature-corrected theories. We next use simulated measurement\naccuracy of the orbital decay rate with FAST/SKA to derive projected upper\nbounds on the generic non-Einsteinian parameters. We find that such bounds from\nblack hole-pulsars can be stronger than those from neutron star-pulsar and\nneutron star-white dwarf binaries by a few orders of magnitude when the\ncorrection enters at negative post-Newtonian orders. By mapping such bounds on\ngeneric parameters to those on various modified theories of gravity, we find\nthat one can constrain the time variation in Newton's constant $G$ to be\ncomparable and complementary to the current strongest bound from solar system\nexperiments. We also study how well one can probe quadratic gravity from black\nhole quadrupole moment measurements of black hole-pulsars. We find that bounds\non the parity-violating sector of quadratic gravity can be stronger than\ncurrent bounds by six orders of magnitude.

To do so, in this paper\nwe carry out a systematic installed jet-noise experiment in the laboratory\nusing a flat plate instead of an aircraft wing. We show that reducing $H$ (the\nseparation distance between the flat plate and jet centreline) causes stronger\nlow-frequency noise enhancement while resulting in little change to the noise\nshielding and enhancement at high frequencies. Decreasing $L$ (the axial\ndistance between the jet exit plane and the trailing edge of the plate) results\nin reduced noise amplification at low frequencies and also weakens both the\nshielding and enhancement at high frequencies. Increasing the jet Mach number\nabates the installation effects. It is shown that the hybrid model developed in\nthe earlier work agrees with experimental measurements and can capture the\neffects of varying $H$, $L$ and jet Mach number extremely well.

Computing a single large and accurate\nvegetation map (e.g., crop/weed) using a DNN is non-trivial due to difficulties\narising from: (1) limited ground sample distances (GSDs) in high-altitude\ndatasets, (2) sacrificed resolution resulting from downsampling high-fidelity\nimages, and (3) multispectral image alignment.

We study the joint design of\nthe three-dimensional (3D) aerial trajectory and the wireless resource\nallocation for maximization of the system sum throughput over a given time\nperiod. As a performance benchmark, we first consider an offline resource\nallocation design assuming non-causal knowledge of the channel gains. The\nalgorithm design is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization\nproblem taking into account the aerodynamic power consumption, solar energy\nharvesting, a finite energy storage capacity, and the quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements of the users. Despite the non-convexity of the optimization\nproblem, we solve it optimally by applying monotonic optimization to obtain the\noptimal 3D-trajectory and the optimal power and subcarrier allocation policy.\nSubsequently, we focus on online algorithm design which only requires real-time\nand statistical knowledge of the channel gains. The optimal online resource\nallocation algorithm is motivated by the offline scheme and entails a high\ncomputational complexity. Hence, we also propose a low-complexity iterative\nsuboptimal online scheme based on successive convex approximation. Our results\nunveil the tradeoff between solar energy harvesting and power-efficient\ncommunication. In particular, the solar-powered UAV first climbs up to a high\naltitude to harvest a sufficient amount of solar energy and then descents again\nto a lower altitude to reduce the path loss of the communication links to the\nusers it serves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 22:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

At each time step, a node is selected\nto interact with one of its neighbors via deterministic or random gossiping.\nSuch node generates a random number as its new state, and sends the subtraction\nbetween its current state and that random number to the neighbor; then the\nneighbor updates its state by adding the received value to its current state.\nWe establish concrete privacy-preservation conditions by proving the\nimpossibility for the reconstruction of the network input from the output of\nthe gossip-based PPSC mechanism against eavesdroppers with full network\nknowledge, and by showing that the PPSC mechanism can achieve differential\nprivacy at arbitrary privacy levels. The convergence is characterized\nexplicitly and analytically for both deterministic and randomized gossiping,\nwhich is essentially achieved in a finite number of steps. Additionally, we\nillustrate that the proposed algorithms can be easily made adaptive in\nreal-world applications by making realtime trade-offs between resilience\nagainst node dropout or communication failure and privacy preservation\ncapabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 00:31:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 09:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

The assumption of straight paths is replaced with\nBayesian models of the most likely path (MLP). Current MLP-based pCT\nreconstruction approaches assume a water scattering environment. We propose an\nMLP formalism based on accurate determination of scattering moments in\ninhomogeneous media. Methods: Scattering power relative to water (RScP) was\ncalculated for a range of human tissues and investigated against relative\nstopping power (RStP). Monte Carlo simulation was used to compare the new\ninhomogeneous MLP formalism to the water approach in a slab geometry and a\nhuman head phantom. An MLP-Spline-Hybrid method was investigated for improved\ncomputational efficiency. Results: A piecewise-linear correlation between RStP\nand RScP was shown, which may assist in iterative pCT reconstruction. The\ninhomogeneous formalism predicted Monte Carlo proton paths through a water cube\nwith thick bone inserts to within 1.0 mm for beams ranging from 210 to 230 MeV\nincident energy. Improvement in accuracy over the conventional MLP ranged from\n5% for a 230 MeV beam to 17% for 210 MeV. There was no noticeable gain in\naccuracy when predicting 200 MeV proton paths through a clinically relevant\nhuman head phantom. The MLP-Spline-Hybrid method reduced computation time by\nhalf while suffering negligible loss of accuracy. Conclusions: We have\npresented an MLP formalism that accounts for material composition.

The\nHausdorff derivative model can be transformed to an advection-dispersion\nequation with time- and space-dependent dispersion and convection coefficients.\nThis model is a fractal partial differential equation (PDE) defined on a\nfractal space and differs from the fractional PDE which is derived for\nnon-local transport of particles on a non-fractal Euclidean space.

Current methods address GZSL by learning a transformation from the\nvisual to the semantic space, exploring the assumption that the distribution of\nclasses in the semantic and visual spaces is relatively similar. Such methods\ntend to transform unseen testing visual representations into one of the seen\nclasses' semantic features instead of the semantic features of the correct\nunseen class, resulting in low accuracy GZSL classification. Recently,\ngenerative adversarial networks (GAN) have been explored to synthesize visual\nrepresentations of the unseen classes from their semantic features - the\nsynthesized representations of the seen and unseen classes are then used to\ntrain the GZSL classifier. This approach has been shown to boost GZSL\nclassification accuracy, however, there is no guarantee that synthetic visual\nrepresentations can generate back their semantic feature in a multi-modal\ncycle-consistent manner. This constraint can result in synthetic visual\nrepresentations that do not represent well their semantic features.

For LED\nluminaires powered by a switched mode power supply, the SEM can be at much\nhigher frequencies than that emitted by conventional incandescent or\nfluorescent lighting.

Several\nrelated works all follow the \"parsing-by-detection\" pipeline that heavily\nrelies on separately trained detection models to localize instances and then\nperforms human parsing for each instance sequentially. Nonetheless, two\ndiscrepant optimization targets of detection and parsing lead to suboptimal\nrepresentation learning and error accumulation for final results. In this work,\nwe make the first attempt to explore a detection-free Part Grouping Network\n(PGN) for efficiently parsing multiple people in an image in a single pass. Our\nPGN reformulates instance-level human parsing as two twinned sub-tasks that can\nbe jointly learned and mutually refined via a unified network: 1) semantic part\nsegmentation for assigning each pixel as a human part (e.g., face, arms); 2)\ninstance-aware edge detection to group semantic parts into distinct person\ninstances. Thus the shared intermediate representation would be endowed with\ncapabilities in both characterizing fine-grained parts and inferring instance\nbelongings of each part. Finally, a simple instance partition process is\nemployed to get final results during inference.

A crucial feature of\nthis formulation is that it doesn't encode support restrictions on the\nunknowns, unlike most prior work on BD. The indeterminacy inherent to BD, which\nis difficult to resolve with a traditional L1 penalty on the impulse responses,\nis resolved in our method because it seeks a first approximation where the\nimpulse responses are: \"maximally white\" -- encoded as the energy focusing near\nzero lag of the impulse-response auto-correlations; and \"maximally\nfront-loaded\" -- encoded as the energy focusing near zero time of the impulse\nresponses. Hence we call the method focused blind deconvolution (FBD). The\nfocusing constraints are relaxed as the iterations progress. Note that FBD\nrequires the duration of the channel outputs to be longer than that of the\nunknown impulse responses.\n  A multichannel blind deconvolution problem that is appropriately formulated\nby sparse and front-loaded impulse responses arises in seismic inversion, where\nthe impulse responses are the Green's function evaluations at different\nreceiver locations, and the operation of a drill bit inputs the noisy and\ncorrelated source signature into the subsurface. We demonstrate the benefits of\nFBD using seismic-while-drilling numerical experiments, where the noisy data\nrecorded at the receivers are hard to interpret, but FBD can provide the\nprocessing essential to separate the drill-bit (source) signature from the\ninterpretable Green's function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 04:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The classical\napproach to solving this problem is to detect if there is a pair of conflicting\nmemory accesses that are unordered by Lamport's happens-before (HB) relation.\nHB based race detection is known to not report false positives, i.e., it is\nsound. However, the soundness guarantee of HB only promises that the first pair\nof unordered, conflicting events is a schedulable data race. That is, there can\nbe pairs of HB-unordered conflicting data accesses that are not schedulable\nraces because there is no reordering of the events of the execution, where the\nevents in race can be executed immediately after each other. We introduce a new\npartial order, called schedulable happens-before (SHB) that exactly\ncharacterizes the pairs of schedulable data races --- every pair of conflicting\ndata accesses that are identified by SHB can be scheduled, and every HB-race\nthat can be scheduled is identified by SHB. Thus, the SHB partial order is\ntruly sound. We present a linear time, vector clock algorithm to detect\nschedulable races using SHB. Our experiments demonstrate the value of our\nalgorithm for dynamic race detection --- SHB incurs only little performance\noverhead and can scale to executions from real-world software applications\nwithout compromising soundness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 06:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

Due to the high UAV\naltitude, the channels between UAVs and the ground base stations (GBSs) are\ndominated by the strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, thus severe interference may\nbe generated to/from the GBSs in the uplink/downlink, which renders the\ninterference management with coexisting terrestrial and aerial users a more\nchallenging problem to solve. In this paper, we study the uplink communication\nfrom a multi-antenna UAV to a set of GBSs in its signal coverage region. Among\nthese GBSs, we denote available GBSs as the ones that do not serve any\nterrestrial users at the assigned resource block (RB) of the UAV, and occupied\nGBSs as the rest that are serving their respectively associated terrestrial\nusers in the same RB. We propose a new cooperative interference cancellation\nstrategy for the multi-beam UAV uplink communication, which aims to eliminate\nthe co-channel interference at each of the occupied GBSs and in the meanwhile\nmaximize the sum-rate to the available GBSs. Specifically, the multi-antenna\nUAV sends multiple data streams to selected available GBSs, which in turn\nforward their decoded data streams to their backhaul-connected occupied GBSs\nfor interference cancellation. To draw useful insights, the maximum\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoF) achievable by the multi-beam UAV communication for\nsum-rate maximization in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is first\ncharacterized, subject to the stringent constraint that all the occupied GBSs\ndo not suffer from any interference in the UAV's uplink transmission. Then,\nbased on the DoF-optimal design, the achievable sum-rate at finite SNR is\nmaximized, subject to given maximum allowable interference power constraints at\neach occupied GBS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 06:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

Conventional techniques usually focus on\nvisualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural\nnetworks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where\ndifferent model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a\ngeneric framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the\nmodel and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the\noutput (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution).

In such situations, the robot\nvisits the same routes multiple times and collects different appearances of it.\nMultiple visual experiences usually find robotic vision applications like\nvisual localization, mapping, place recognition, and autonomous navigation. The\nnovelty in this paper is an algorithm that connects multiple visual experiences\nvia aligning multiple image sequences. This problem is solved by finding the\nmaximum flow in a directed graph flow-network, whose vertices represent the\nmatches between frames in the test and reference sequences. Edges of the graph\nrepresent the cost of these matches. The problem of finding the best match is\nreduced to finding the minimum-cut surface, which is solved as a maximum flow\nnetwork problem. Application to visual localization is considered in this paper\nto show the effectiveness of the proposed multiple image sequence alignment\nmethod, without loosing its generality. Experimental evaluations show that the\nprecision of sequence matching is improved by considering multiple visual\nsequences for the same route, and that the method performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art single representation methods like SeqSLAM and ABLE-M.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 07:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

For local bijectivity of the\nlinearization at a root, a radius of quadratic convergence was explicitly\ncalculated in terms of local Lipschitz constants of the underlying PS function.\nIn the present work we relax the criterium of local bijectivity of the\nlinearization to local openness. For this purpose a weak implicit function\ntheorem is proved via local mapping degree theory.

Unlike classical supervised learning and online\nlearning settings, in batch contextual bandit learning, one only has access to\na collection of logged feedback from the actions taken by a historical policy,\nand expect to learn a policy that takes good actions in possibly unseen\ncontexts. Such a batch learning setting is ubiquitous in online and interactive\nsystems, such as ad platforms and recommendation systems. Existing approaches\nbased on inverse propensity weights, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS)\nand Policy Optimizer for Exponential Models (POEM), enjoy unbiasedness but\noften suffer from large mean squared error. In this work, we introduce a new\napproach named Maximum Likelihood Inverse Propensity Scoring (MLIPS) for batch\nlearning from logged bandit feedback. Instead of using the given historical\npolicy as the proposal in inverse propensity weights, we estimate a maximum\nlikelihood surrogate policy based on the logged action-context pairs, and then\nuse this surrogate policy as the proposal. We prove that MLIPS is\nasymptotically unbiased, and moreover, has a smaller nonasymptotic mean squared\nerror than IPS. Such an error reduction phenomenon is somewhat surprising as\nthe estimated surrogate policy is less accurate than the given historical\npolicy. Results on multi-label classification problems and a large- scale ad\nplacement dataset demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of MLIPS.\nFurthermore, the proposed surrogate policy technique is complementary to\nexisting error reduction techniques, and when combined, is able to consistently\nboost the performance of several widely used approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 08:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

In order to reach this conclusion, we first\nidentify the frequency with which different outcomes occur in a sample, as the\nvariable carrying useful information on the generative process. The entropy of\nthe frequency, that we call relevance, provides an upper bound to the number of\ninformative bits. This differs from the entropy of the data, that we take as a\nmeasure of resolution. Samples that maximise relevance at a given resolution -\nthat we call maximally informative samples - exhibit statistical criticality.\nIn particular, Zipf's law arises at the optimal trade-off between resolution\n(i.e. compression) and relevance. As a byproduct, we derive a bound of the\nmaximal number of parameters that can be estimated from a dataset, in the\nabsence of prior knowledge on the generative model.\n  Furthermore, we relate criticality to the statistical properties of the\nrepresentation of the data generating process. We show that, as a consequence\nof the concentration property of the Asymptotic Equipartition Property,\nrepresentations that are maximally informative about the data generating\nprocess are characterised by an exponential distribution of energy levels. This\narises from a principle of minimal entropy, that is conjugate of the maximum\nentropy principle in statistical mechanics.

Social robots need\nto communicate with humans, which increased also the popularity of affective\nembodied models that adopt different emotional concepts in many everyday tasks.\nHowever, there is still a gap between the development of these solutions and\nthe integration and development of a complex emotion appraisal system, which is\nmuch necessary for true social robots. In this paper, we propose a deep neural\nmodel which is designed in the light of different aspects of developmental\nlearning of emotional concepts to provide an integrated solution for internal\nand external emotion appraisal. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nmodel with different challenging corpora and compare it with state-of-the-art\nmodels for external emotion appraisal. To extend the evaluation of the proposed\nmodel, we designed and collected a novel dataset based on a Human-Robot\nInteraction (HRI) scenario. We deployed the model in an iCub robot and\nevaluated the capability of the robot to learn and describe the affective\nbehavior of different persons based on observation. The performed experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the state of the art in\ndescribing emotion behavior in general. In addition, it is able to generate\ninternal emotional concepts that evolve through time: it continuously forms and\nupdates the formed emotional concepts, which is a step towards creating an\nemotional appraisal model grounded in the robot experiences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 10:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

Our approach consists in adding a saliency branch\nto an existing CNN architecture which is used to modulate the standard\nbottom-up visual features from the original image input, acting as an\nattentional mechanism that guides the feature extraction process. The main aim\nof the proposed approach is to enable the effective training of a fine-grained\nrecognition model with limited training samples and to improve the performance\non the task, thereby alleviating the need to annotate large dataset. % The vast\nmajority of saliency methods are evaluated on their ability to generate\nsaliency maps, and not on their functionality in a complete vision pipeline.\nOur proposed pipeline allows to evaluate saliency methods for the high-level\ntask of object recognition. We perform extensive experiments on various\nfine-grained datasets (Flowers, Birds, Cars, and Dogs) under different\nconditions and show that saliency can considerably improve the network's\nperformance, especially for the case of scarce training data. Furthermore, our\nexperiments show that saliency methods that obtain improved saliency maps (as\nmeasured by traditional saliency benchmarks) also translate to saliency methods\nthat yield improved performance gains when applied in an object recognition\npipeline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 10:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:17:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 May 2019 16:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

The objective is to achieve\nthis while affecting Primary user transmissions only positively, namely: 1)\navoid network coding operations at the Primary transmitter in order avoid\nincrease of its complexity and storage requirements, 2) keep the order of\npackets received by the Primary receiver the same as in the non cooperative\ncase and 3) induce packet service times that are stochastically smaller than\npacket service times induced in the non-cooperative case. A network coding\nalgorithm is investigated in terms of achieved throughput region and it is\nshown to enlarge Secondary user throughput as compared to the case where the\nSecondary transmitter acts as a simple relay, while leaving the Primary user\nstability region unaffected. A notable feature of this algorithm is that it\noperates without knowledge of channel and packet arrival rate statistics. We\nalso investigate a second network coding algorithm which increases the\nthroughput region of the system; however, the latter algorithm requires\nknowledge of channel and packet arrival rate statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 10:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

Recent simulations\ncombining convection and the magnetorotational instability have given fresh\nimpetus to the debate, as the interplay of the two processes can enhance\nangular momentum transport, at least in the optically thick outburst stage of\ndwarf novae. In this paper we seek to isolate and understand the most generic\nfeatures of disc convection, and so undertake its study in purely\nhydrodynamical models. First, we investigate the linear phase of the\ninstability, obtaining estimates of the growth rates both semi-analytically,\nusing one-dimensional spectral computations, as well as analytically, using\nWKBJ methods. Next we perform three-dimensional, vertically stratified,\nshearing box simulations with the conservative, finite-volume code PLUTO, both\nwith and without explicit diffusion coefficients. We find that hydrodynamic\nconvection can, in general, drive outward angular momentum transport, a result\nthat we confirm with ATHENA, an alternative finite-volume code.

Using quantum dot devices to produce joint\nspin-photonic states requires the electronic spin qubits to be stored for\nextended times. Therefore, the study of the coherence of spins of various\nquantum dot confined charge carriers is important both scientifically and\ntechnologically. In this study we report on spin relaxation measurements\nperformed on five different forms of electronic spin qubits confined in the\nvery same quantum dot. In particular, we use all optical techniques to measure\nthe spin relaxation of the confined heavy hole and that of the dark exciton - a\nlong lived electron-heavy hole pair with parallel spins. Our measured results\nfor the spin relaxation of the electron, the heavy-hole, the dark exciton, the\nnegative and the positive trions, in the absence of externally applied magnetic\nfield, are in agreement with a central spin theory which attributes the\ndephasing of the carriers' spin to their hyperfine interactions with the\nnuclear spins of the atoms forming the quantum dots. We demonstrate that the\nheavy hole dephases much slower than the electron. We also show, both\nexperimentally and theoretically, that the dark exciton dephases slower than\nthe heavy hole, due to the electron-hole exchange interaction, which partially\nprotects its spin state from dephasing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 12:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

We evaluate energy consumption on four\ndifferent networks based on the two most popular ones (ResNet/AlexNet): ResNet\n(167 layers), a 2D CNN (15 layers), a CaffeNet (25 layers) and a ResNetIm (94\nlayers) using batch sizes of 64, 128 and 256, and then correlate those with\nspeed-up and accuracy to determine optimal settings.

Assuming we evaluate $n$ 2D anchors in each frame, then the number of\npossible transitions from each 2D anchor to the next, for a sequence of $f$\nconsecutive frames, is in the order of $O(n^f)$, expensive even for small\nvalues of $f$. To avoid this problem, we introduce a Transition-Matrix-based\nNetwork (TraMNet) which relies on computing transition probabilities between\nanchor proposals while maximising their overlap with ground truth bounding\nboxes across frames, and enforcing sparsity via a transition threshold. As the\nresulting transition matrix is sparse and stochastic, this reduces the proposal\nhypothesis search space from $O(n^f)$ to the cardinality of the thresholded\nmatrix. At training time, transitions are specific to cell locations of the\nfeature maps, so that a sparse (efficient) transition matrix is used to train\nthe network.

The confusion errors are not only caused by similar visual\npatterns but also amplified by various factors during the training of our\ndesigned models, such as reduced feature resolution in the encoding process or\nimbalanced data distributions. A large amount of deep learning based network\nstructures has been proposed in recent years to deal with these individual\nfactors and improve network performance. However, to our knowledge, no existing\nwork in semantic image segmentation is designed to tackle confusion errors\nexplicitly. In this paper, we present a novel and general network structure\nthat reduces confusion errors in more direct manner and apply the network for\nsemantic segmentation. There are two major contributions in our network\nstructure: 1) We ensemble subnets with heterogeneous output spaces based on the\ndiscriminative confusing groups. The training for each subnet can distinguish\nconfusing classes within the group without affecting unrelated classes outside\nthe group. 2) We propose an improved cross-entropy loss function that maximizes\nthe probability assigned to the correct class and penalizes the probabilities\nassigned to the confusing classes at the same time.

Depending on the excess membrane area available in the\nsystem, three different dynamical regimes, denoted as A, B and C, are found\nfrom the numerical solution of the model. In regime A, membranes with small\nexcess area form flat adhesion domains and freeze. Such freezing is interpreted\nby means of an effective model for curvature-driven domain wall motion. The\nnonlocal membrane tension tends to a negative value corresponding to the linear\nstability threshold of flat domain walls in the Swift-Hohenberg equation. In\nregime B, membranes with intermediate excess areas exhibit endless coarsening\nwith coexistence of flat adhesion domains and wrinkle domains. The tension\ntends to the nonlinear stability threshold of flat domain walls in the\nSwift-Hohenberg equation. The fraction of the system covered by the wrinkle\nphase increases linearly with the excess area in regime B. In regime C,\nmembranes with large excess area are completely covered by a frozen\nlabyrinthine pattern of wrinkles. As the excess area is increased, the tension\nincreases and the wavelength of the wrinkles decreases.

For the latter, if the NLSM has\nboth time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the IF shift is zero; otherwise it\ncould be finite.

The new approach is based on a\nhybrid fluid formulation that combines the advantages of purely Eulerian\n(fixed-grid) and Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE moving mesh) formulations\nin the context of FSI. The structure - as commonly given in Lagrangian\ndescription - is surrounded by a fine resolved layer of fluid elements based on\nan ALE-framework. This ALE-fluid patch, which is embedded in an Eulerian\nbackground fluid domain, follows the deformation and motion of the structural\ninterface. This approximation technique is not limited to Finite Element\nMethods, but can can also be realized within other frameworks like Finite\nVolume or Discontinuous Galerkin Methods. In this work, the surface coupling\nbetween the two disjoint fluid subdomains is imposed weakly using a stabilized\nNitsche's technique in a Cut Finite Element Method (CutFEM) framework. At the\nfluid-solid interface, standard weak coupling of node-matching or non-matching\nfinite element approximations can be utilized. As the fluid subdomains can be\nmeshed independently, a sufficient mesh quality in the vicinity of the common\nfluid-structure interface can be assured. To our knowledge the proposed method\nis the only method (despite some overlapping domain decomposition approaches\nthat suffer from other issues) that allows for capturing boundary layers and\nflow detachment via appropriate grids around largely moving and deforming\nbodies and is able to do this e.g. without the necessity of costly remeshing\nprocedures. In addition it might also help to safe computational costs as now\nbackground grids can be much coarser.

Inspired\nby Active Appearance Models, we develop a data-driven rendering pipeline that\nlearns a joint representation of facial geometry and appearance from a\nmultiview capture setup. Vertex positions and view-specific textures are\nmodeled using a deep variational autoencoder that captures complex nonlinear\neffects while producing a smooth and compact latent representation.\nView-specific texture enables the modeling of view-dependent effects such as\nspecularity. In addition, it can also correct for imperfect geometry stemming\nfrom biased or low resolution estimates. This is a significant departure from\nthe traditional graphics pipeline, which requires highly accurate geometry as\nwell as all elements of the shading model to achieve realism through\nphysically-inspired light transport. Acquiring such a high level of accuracy is\ndifficult in practice, especially for complex and intricate parts of the face,\nsuch as eyelashes and the oral cavity. These are handled naturally by our\napproach, which does not rely on precise estimates of geometry. Instead, the\nshading model accommodates deficiencies in geometry though the flexibility\nafforded by the neural network employed. At inference time, we condition the\ndecoding network on the viewpoint of the camera in order to generate the\nappropriate texture for rendering. The resulting system can be implemented\nsimply using existing rendering engines through dynamic textures with flat\nlighting.

Hence, we design\na new framework for kernel two-sample testing conforming to differential\nprivacy constraints, in order to guarantee the privacy of subjects in the data.\nUnlike existing differentially private parametric tests that simply add noise\nto data, kernel-based testing imposes a challenge due to a complex dependence\nof test statistics on the raw data, as these statistics correspond to\nestimators of distances between representations of probability measures in\nHilbert spaces. Our approach considers finite dimensional approximations to\nthose representations.

Giant planets open gaps in their protoplanetary and subsequently\nsuffer so-called type II migration. Schematically, planets are thought to be\ntightly locked within their surrounding disks, and forced to follow the viscous\nadvection of gas onto the central star. This fundamental principle however has\nrecently been questioned, as migrating planets were shown to decouple from the\ngas' radial drift. Aims. In this framework, we question whether the\ntraditionally used linear scaling of migration rate of a giant planet with the\ndisk's viscosity still holds. Additionally, we assess the role of\norbit-crossing material as part of the decoupling mechanism. Methods. We have\nperformed 2D (r, {\\theta}) numerical simulations of point-mass planets embedded\nin locally isothermal {\\alpha}-disks in steady-state accretion, with various\nvalues of {\\alpha}. Arbitrary planetary accretion rates were used as a means to\ndiminish or nullify orbit-crossing flows. Results. We confirm that the\nmigration rate of a gap-opening planet is indeed proportional to the disk's\nviscosity, but is not equal to the gas drift speed in the unperturbed disk. We\nshow that the role of gap-crossing flows is in fact negligible. Conclusions.\nFrom these observations, we propose a new paradigm for type II migration : a\ngiant planet feels a torque from the disk that promotes its migration, while\nthe gap profile relative to the planet is restored on a viscous timescale, thus\nlimiting the planet migration rate to be proportional to the disk's viscosity.\nHence, in disks with low viscosity in the planet region, type II migration\nshould still be very slow.

However, its\ncomputational cost remains high, even unreachable under modest computational\nsettings. Affording SMBO with weight-sharing alleviates this problem.

Usually, there are two approaches to consider these\ncosts, either explicitly modelling these different factors to calculate the\ncost or consider heuristics costs. First approach is lengthy and cumbersome and\nrequires a new model for every new factor. Heuristics cost cannot account for\nthe change in cost due to change in state. This work proposes a new method to\ncompute these costs, without the need of explicitly modelling the factors. The\nidentified cost is modelled in a bi-linear state-space form where the change of\ncosts is formed due to the change of these states. This eliminates the need to\nmodel all factors to derive the cost for every robot. In context of\ntransportation, the travel time is identified as the key parameter to\nunderstand costs of traversing paths to carry material. The necessity to\nidentify and estimate these travel times is proved by using them in route\nplanning. The paths are computed constantly and average of total path costs of\nthese paths are compared with that of paths obtained by heuristics costs.

To compensate for these\ninherited shortcomings in spectro-temporal features, we propose to enhance the\nproposed Siamese convolutional neural network architecture by deploying a\nmultilayer perceptron network to incorporate the prosodic, jitter, and shimmer\nfeatures. The proposed end-to-end verification architecture performs feature\nextraction and verification simultaneously.

In particular, surface-surface $F_{ss}$ and surface-void $F_{sv}$\ncorrelation functions (obtainable from radiation scattering experiments)\ncontain crucial interfacial information that enables one to estimate transport\nproperties of the media (e.g., the mean survival time and fluid permeability)\nand complements the information content of the conventional two-point\ncorrelation function. However, the current technical difficulty involved in\nsampling surface correlation functions has been a stumbling block in their\nwidespread use. We first present a concise derivation of the small-$r$\nbehaviors of these functions, which are linked to the \\textit{mean curvature}\nof the system.

The neuron's activation function, however, requires nonlinearity which\ncan be achieved either through nonlinear optics or electro-optics. Nonlinear\noptics, while potentially faster, is challenging at low optical power. With\nelectro-optics, a photodiode integrating the weighted products of a photonic\nperceptron can be paired directly to a modulator, which creates a nonlinear\ntransfer function for efficient operating. Here we model the activation\nfunctions of five types of electro-absorption modulators, analyze their\nindividual performance over varying performance parameters, and simulate their\ncombined effect on the inference of the neural network\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 16:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Many organizations see value in the maintenance and management\nmodel of NoOps that stands for No Operations. One of the implementations of\nthis model is a system that is maintained automatically without any human\nintervention. The path to NoOps involves not only precise and fast diagnostics\nbut also reusing as much knowledge as possible after the system is reconfigured\nor changed. The biggest challenge is to leverage knowledge on one IT system and\nreuse this knowledge for diagnostics of another, different system. We propose a\nframework of weighted graphs which can transfer knowledge, and perform\nhigh-quality diagnostics of IT systems. We encode all possible data in a graph\nrepresentation of a system state and automatically calculate weights of these\ngraphs. Then, thanks to the evaluation of similarity between graphs, we\ntransfer knowledge about failures from one system to another and use it for\ndiagnostics. We successfully evaluate the proposed approach on Spark, Hadoop,\nKafka and Cassandra systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 13:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}
