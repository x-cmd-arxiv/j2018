We show that the modified expansion\nlaw of the universe proposed by Sheykhi in a non-flat Friedmann-\nRobertson-Walker (FRW) universe and by Cai in a flat FRW universe could be\nderived starting from the first law of thermodynamics, in (n+1) dimensional\nEinstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet and more general Lovelock gravity theories.

A 3D printer was modified and merged with an extrusion\nsystem and specimens were 3D-printed using a layer-wise direct ink writing\n(DIW) process capable of fabrication of lamellar architectures of materials. A\nlab-based X-ray microscope (XRM) was used to perform X-ray micro-computed\ntomography (micro-CT) evaluations to explore the microstructural\ncharacteristics of 3-day old intact (i.e. not tested) 3D printed and cast\nspecimens at two levels of magnification: 0.4X and 4X.

In comparison,\nmicrostructural investigation of cast specimen at 4X scan revealed randomly\ndistributed pores with no connectivity throughout the specimen. The aptitude of\nmicro-CT as a non-destructive technique for microstructural characterization is\ndiscussed. The role of processing to induce and to pattern heterogeneities such\nas IRs in materials is demonstrated and the role of architecture in controlling\nsuch heterogeneities and their directionality through the interface is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 16:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

These exospheres are formed by surface\nparticles that have been sputtered by the wind of the host star. The stellar\nwind properties are derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which are\ndriven by observationally-derived stellar magnetic field maps, and constrained\nby Ly-alpha observations of wind mass-loss rates, making this one of the most\nwell constrained model of winds of low-mass stars. The proximity of the planets\nto their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus\nthe sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,\nrefractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from\nthe entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg\ncreating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,\nextending to several planetary radii. For planet b, the column density of OI\nalong the line of sight reaches 10^{13}/cm2, with the highest values found\nahead of its orbital motion.

Our algorithm works even if the ABNNR\nconstruction is not applied to a base code $C$ but to any string.

The constraint graph\nis an expander, so we can solve unique games efficiently. These solutions are\nthe output of the list decoder. This is a novel use of a unique games algorithm\nas a subroutine in a decoding procedure, as opposed to the more common\nsituation in which unique games are used for demonstrating hardness results.\n  Double samplers and high dimensional expanders are akin to pseudorandom\nobjects in their utility, but they greatly exceed random objects in their\ncombinatorial properties.

Here we extend the discussion to the two other\nrealizations possible with antilinear symmetry, namely energies in complex\nconjugate pairs or Jordan-block Hamiltonians that are not diagonalizable at\nall. In particular, we show that under certain circumstances it is possible for\nthe Goldstone boson mode itself to be one of the zero-norm states that are\ncharacteristic of Jordan-block Hamiltonians.

Since we use a standard\nvariational procedure we can readily extend our analysis to a continuous local\nsymmetry by introducing a gauge boson. We show that when we do this the gauge\nboson acquires a non-zero mass by the Higgs mechanism in all realizations of\nthe antilinear symmetry, except the one where the Goldstone boson itself has\nzero norm, in which case, and despite the fact that the continuous local\nsymmetry has been spontaneously broken, the gauge boson remains massless.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 17:37:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

The recipe we provide is general and applies\nto any other process within the dimension $\\le 8$ Standard Model Effective\nTheory.

Models typically include energy injection from\nsupernovae as the dominant form of stellar feedback, often in some form of\nsub-grid recipe. However, it has been recently suggested that pre-SN feedback\n(stellar winds or radiation) is necessary in high-resolution simulations of\ngalaxy evolution to properly regulate star formation and properties of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Following these processes is computationally\nchallenging, so many prescriptions model this feedback approximately,\naccounting for the local destruction of dense gas clouds around newly formed\nstars in lieu of a full radiative transfer calculation. In this work we examine\nhigh resolution simulations (1.8~pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed\nstellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis. By following stellar ionizing\nradiation with an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, we test its\nimportance in regulating star formation and driving outflows in this galaxy. We\nfind that including ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate (SFR) by\nover a factor of 5, and is necessary to produce the ISM conditions needed for\nsupernovae to drive significant outflows. We find that a localized\napproximation for radiation feedback is sufficient to regulate the SFR on short\ntimescales, but does not allow significant outflows. Short and long range\nradiation effects are both important in driving the evolution of our\nlow-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy. Generalizing these results to more\nmassive galaxies would be a valuable avenue of future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

We present the spectral line setup of the CORE survey and a\ncase study for W3(H2O). At ~0.35\" (700 AU at 2 kpc) resolution, the W3(H2O)\nclump fragments into two cores (West and East), separated by ~2300 AU.

The kinematics of the rotating\nstructure about W3(H2O) W shows signs of differential rotation of material,\npossibly in a disk-like object. The observed rotational signature around\nW3(H2O) E may be due to a disk-like object, an unresolved binary (or multiple)\nsystem, or a combination of both. We fit the emission of CH3CN (12-11) K = 4-6\nand derive a gas temperature map with a median temperature of ~165 K across\nW3(H2O).

The latter are thermal (mixed or pure)\nstates of the model in the presence of an additional static force, but become\nnon-equilibrium states after a sudden removal of this static force. For this\nclass and high temperatures, we show that the induced dynamics is given by a\nsingle correlation function at equilibrium, independent of the initial\nexpectation values being prepared close to equilibrium (by a weak static force)\nor far away from equilibrium (by a strong static force). Remarkably, this type\nof universality holds true in both, the ergodic phase and the many-body\nlocalized regime. Moreover, it does not depend on the specific choice of a unit\ncell for the local density. We particularly discuss two important consequences.\nFirst, the long-time expectation value of the local density is uniquely\ndetermined by the fluctuations of its diagonal matrix elements in the energy\neigenbasis. Thus, the validity of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is\nnot only a sufficient but also a necessary condition for thermalization.\nSecond, the real-time broadening of density profiles is always given by the\ncurrent autocorrelation function at equilibrium via a generalized Einstein\nrelation. In the context of transport, we discuss the influence of disorder for\nlarge particle-particle interactions, where normal diffusion is known to occur\nin the disorder-free case. Our results suggest that normal diffusion is stable\nagainst weak disorder, while they are consistent with anomalous diffusion for\nstronger disorder below the localization transition. Particularly, for weak\ndisorder, Gaussian density profiles can be observed for single disorder\nrealizations, which we demonstrate for finite lattices up to 31 sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 18:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

We present\nconstraints to remove symmetry in order to lessen the computational effort\nrequired, as well as constraints that significantly improve the value of the\nlinear programming relaxation of our formulation. A heuristic algorithm based\non partial integer optimisation of our mathematical formulation is also\npresented. Once order batching has been decided we optimally route each\nindividual picker using a previous approach presented in the literature.\n  Extensive computational results for publicly available test problems\ninvolving up to 75 orders are given for both single and multiple block\nwarehouse configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 18:36:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 16:37:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 18:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

A good knowledge of the main atmospheric\nprocesses that drive the chemical distribution is therefore essential to\ninterpret exoplanetary spectra. An atmosphere reaches chemical equilibrium if\nthe rates of the forward and backward chemical reactions converge to the same\nvalue. However, there are atmospheric processes, such as atmospheric transport,\nthat destabilize this equilibrium. In this work we study the changes in\ncomposition driven by a 3D wind field in WASP-43b using our Global Circulation\nModel, THOR.

OTFS has the novel and\nimportant feature of being designed in the delay-Doppler domain. When coupled\nwith a suitable equalizer, OTFS modulation is able to exploit the full channel\ndiversity over both time and frequency. Moreover, it converts the fading,\ntime-varying wireless channel experienced by modulated signals such as OFDM\ninto a time-independent channel with a complex channel gain that is essentially\nconstant for all symbols.\n  This design obviates the need for transmitter adaptation, and greatly\nsimplifies system operation. The paper describes the basic operating principles\nof OTFS as well as a possible implementation as an overlay to current or\nanticipated standardized systems. OTFS is shown to provide significant\nperformance improvement in systems with high Doppler, short packets, and/or\nlarge antenna array. In particular, simulation results indicate at least\nseveral dB of block error rate performance improvement for OTFS over OFDM in\nall of these settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 19:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

Ant colony is a simple yet\nefficient natural system for understanding the effects of primary intelligence\non optimization. However, existing AS algorithms are mostly focusing on their\ncapability of using social heuristic cues while ignoring their individual\nlearning. CGO can integrate the advantages of a cooperative group and a\nlow-level algorithm portfolio design, and the agents of CGO can explore both\nindividual and social search. In CGO-AS, each ant (agent) is added with an\nindividual memory, and is implemented with a novel search strategy to use\nindividual and social cues in a controlled proportion. The presented CGO-AS is\ntherefore especially useful in exposing the power of the mixed individual and\nsocial learning for improving optimization. The optimization performance is\ntested with instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The results\nprove that a cooperative ant group using both individual and social learning\nobtains a better performance than the systems solely using either individual or\nsocial learning. The best performance is achieved under the condition when\nagents use individual memory as their primary information source, and\nsimultaneously use social memory as their searching guidance. In comparison\nwith existing AS systems, CGO-AS retains a faster learning speed toward those\nhigher-quality solutions, especially in the later learning cycles. The leverage\nin optimization by CGO-AS is highly possible due to its inherent feature of\nadaptively maintaining the population diversity in the individual memory of\nagents, and of accelerating the learning process with accumulated knowledge in\nthe social memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 19:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

Mobile phones are used by men and\nwomen across a wide age range in both developed and developing countries.\nConsequently, they have become one of the most important mechanisms for social\ninteraction within a population, making them an increasingly important source\nof information to understand human demographics and human behaviour.\n  In this work we combine two sources of information: communication logs from a\nmajor mobile operator in a Latin American country, and information on the\ndemographics of a subset of the users population. This allows us to perform an\nobservational study of mobile phone usage, differentiated by age groups\ncategories. This study is interesting in its own right, since it provides\nknowledge on the structure and demographics of the mobile phone market in the\nstudied country.\n  We then tackle the problem of inferring the age group for all users in the\nnetwork. We present here an exclusively graph-based inference method relying\nsolely on the topological structure of the mobile network, together with a\ntopological analysis of the performance of the algorithm. The equations for our\nalgorithm can be described as a diffusion process with two added properties:\n(i) memory of its initial state, and (ii) the information is propagated as a\nprobability vector for each node attribute (instead of the value of the\nattribute itself). Our algorithm can successfully infer different age groups\nwithin the network population given known values for a subset of nodes (seed\nnodes). Most interestingly, we show that by carefully analysing the topological\nrelationships between correctly predicted nodes and the seed nodes, we can\ncharacterize particular subsets of nodes for which our inference method has\nsignificantly higher accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 19:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

It has\nsince been extended to numerous other applications including execution of\nprograms that exist on the blockchain called \"smart contracts.\" Smart contracts\nhave a major limitation, namely they only operate on data that is on the\nblockchain. Trusted entities called oracles attest to external data in order to\nbring it onto the blockchain but they do so without the robust security\nguarantees that blockchains generally provide. This has the potential to turn\noracles into centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this paper\nintroduces Astraea, a decentralized oracle based on a voting game that decides\nthe truth or falsity of propositions. Players fall into two roles: voters and\ncertifiers. Voters play a low-risk/low-reward role that is resistant to\nadversarial manipulation while certifiers play a high-risk/high-reward role so\nthey are required to play with a high degree of accuracy. This paper also\npresents a formal analysis of the parameters behind the system to measure the\nprobability of an adversary with bounded funds being able to successfully\nmanipulate the oracle's decision, that shows that the same parameters can be\nset to make manipulation arbitrarily difficult---a desirable feature for the\nsystem. Further, this analysis demonstrates that under those conditions a Nash\nequilibrium exists where all rational players are forced to behave honestly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 19:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

The underlying goal\nis to improve our understanding of the concept of thermal equilibrium in\nquantum systems. First, I investigated the role played by observables and\nmeasurements in the emergence of thermal behaviour. This led to a new notion of\nthermal equilibrium which is specific for a given observable, rather than for\nthe whole state of the system. The equilibrium picture that emerges is a\ngeneralization of statistical mechanics in which we are not interested in the\nstate of the system but only in the outcome of the measurement process. I\ninvestigated how this picture relates to one of the most promising approaches\nfor the emergence of thermal behaviour in isolated quantum systems: the\nEigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Then, I applied the results to study some\nequilibrium properties of many-body localised systems. Despite the localization\nphenomenon, which prevents thermalization of subsystems, I was able to show\nthat we can still use the predictions of statistical mechanics to describe the\nequilibrium of some observables. Moreover, the intuition developed in the\nprocess led me to propose an experimentally accessible way to unravel the\ninteracting nature of many-body localised systems. Second, I exploited the\n\"Concentration of Measure\" phenomenon to study the macroscopic properties of\nthe basis states of Loop Quantum Gravity. These techniques were previously used\nto explain why the thermal behaviour in quantum systems is such an ubiquitous\nphenomenon, at the macroscopic scale. I focused on the local properties, their\nthermodynamic behaviour and interplay with the semiclassical limit. This was\nmotivated by the necessity to understand, from a quantum gravity perspective,\nhow and why a classical horizon exhibits thermal properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 19:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

In\nthis paper, we investigate the benefits of component compression and modeling\nof both time and phase delay structures between basis components in the SM\nkernel. By verifying the presence of dependencies between function components\nusing Gaussian conditionals and posterior covariance, we first propose a new SM\nkernel variant with a time and phase delay dependency structure (SMD) and then\nprovide a structure adaptation (SA) algorithm for the SMD. The SMD kernel is\nconstructed in two steps: first, time delay and phase delay are incorporated\ninto each basis component; next, cross-convolution between a basis component\nand the reversed complex conjugate of another basis component is performed,\nwhich yields a complex-valued and positive definite kernel incorporating\ndependency structures between basis components. The model compression and\ndependency sparsity of the SMD kernel can be obtained by using automatic\npruning in SA.

If the governing SDE were gradient,\nthe maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates, expected exit times,\nand the invariant probability distribution would be given in terms of its\npotential function. The quasipotential plays a similar role for nongradient\nSDEs. Unfortunately, the quasipotential is the solution of a functional\nminimization problem that can be obtained analytically only in some special\ncases. We propose a Dijkstra-like solver for computing the quasipotential on\nregular rectangular meshes in 3D. This solver results from a promotion and an\nupgrade of the previously introduced ordered line integral method with the\nmidpoint quadrature rule for 2D SDEs. The key innovations that have allowed us\nto keep the CPU times reasonable while maintaining good accuracy are $(i)$ a\nnew hierarchical update strategy, $(ii)$ the use of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theory\nfor rejecting unnecessary simplex updates, and $(iii)$ pruning the number of\nadmissible simplexes and a fast search for them. An extensive numerical study\nis conducted on a series of linear and nonlinear examples where the\nquasipotential is analytically available or can be found at transition states\nby other methods. In particular, the proposed solver is applied to Tao's\nexamples where the transition states are hyperbolic periodic orbits, and to a\ngenetic switch model by Lv et al. (2014).

These planet candidates are suitable\nfor further spectroscopic follow-up and precise mass determinations, leading\nultimately to the construction of empirical mass-radius diagrams. Particularly\ninteresting is to constrain the properties of planets between the Earth and\nNeptune in size, the most abundant type of planets orbiting Sun-like stars with\nperiods less than a few years. Among many other K2 candidates, we discovered a\nmulti-planetary system around EPIC246471491, with four planets ranging in size\nfrom twice the size of Earth, to nearly the size of Neptune. We measure the\nmass of the planets of the EPIC246471491 system by means of precise radial\nvelocity measurements using the CARMENES spectrograph and the HARPS-N\nspectrograph. With our data we are able to determine the mass of the two inner\nplanets of the system with a precision better than 15%, and place upper limits\non the masses of the two outer planets. We find that EPIC246471491b has a mass\nof 9.68 Me, and a radius of 2.59 Re, yielding a mean density of 3.07 g/cm3,\nwhile EPIC246471491c has a mass of 15.68 Me, radius of 3.53 Re, and a mean\ndensity of 19.5 g/cm3. For EPIC246471491d (R=2.48Re) and EPIC246471491e\n(R=1.95Re) the upper limits for the masses are 6.5 and 10.7 Me, respectively.\nThe system is thus composed of a nearly Neptune-twin planet (in mass and\nradius), two sub-Neptunes with very different densities and presumably bulk\ncomposition, and a fourth planet in the outermost orbit that resides right in\nthe middle of the super-Earth/sub-Neptune radius gap. Future comparative\nplanetology studies of this system can provide useful insights into planetary\nformation, and also a good test of atmospheric escape and evolution theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 21:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Here, we\ndevelop a simple, analytic expression for both the downwelling thermal and net\nthermal radiative fluxes in a planetary troposphere. We assume that the\natmosphere is non-scattering at thermal wavelengths and that opacities are grey\nat these same wavelengths. Additionally, we adopt an atmospheric thermal\nstructure that follows a modified dry adiabat as well as a physically motivated\npower law relationship between grey thermal optical depth and atmospheric\npressure.

Next, we seek to better understand our analytic model by exploring\nhow thermal radiative flux profiles respond to variations in key physical\nparameters, such as the total grey thermal optical depth of the atmosphere.\nUsing energy balance arguments, we derive convective flux pro-files for the\ntropospheres of all Solar System worlds with thick atmospheres, and propose a\nscaling that enables inter-comparison of these profiles. Lastly, we use our\nanalytic treatment to discuss the validity of other simple models of convective\nfluxes in planetary atmospheres.

Measures of entropy\nreveal a city's streets' order and disorder. Past studies have explored\nindividual cases of orientation and entropy, but little is known about broader\npatterns and trends worldwide. This study examines street network orientation,\nconfiguration, and entropy in 100 cities around the world using OpenStreetMap\ndata and OSMnx. It measures the entropy of street bearings in weighted and\nunweighted network models, along with each city's typical street segment\nlength, average circuity, average node degree, and the network's proportions of\nfour-way intersections and dead-ends. It also develops a new indicator of\norientation-order that quantifies how a city's street network follows the\ngeometric ordering logic of a single grid. A cluster analysis is performed to\nexplore similarities and differences among these study sites in multiple\ndimensions. Significant statistical relationships exist between city\norientation-order and other indicators of spatial order, including street\ncircuity and measures of connectedness. On average, US/Canadian study sites are\nfar more grid-like than those elsewhere, exhibiting less entropy and circuity.\nThese indicators, taken in concert, help reveal the extent and nuance of the\ngrid.

No-reference (NR) Image sharpness\nassessment (ISA) techniques have emerged as the standard of image quality\nassessment in diverse imaging applications. Despite their high correlation with\nsubjective scoring, they are challenging for practical considerations due to\nhigh computational cost and lack of scalability across different image blurs.\nWe bridge this gap by synthesizing the HVS response as a linear combination of\nFinite Impulse Response (FIR) derivative filters to boost the falloff of high\nband frequency magnitudes in natural imaging paradigm. The numerical\nimplementation of the HVS filter is carried out with MaxPol filter library that\ncan be arbitrarily set for any differential orders and cutoff frequencies to\nbalance out the estimation of informative features and noise sensitivities. We\nthen design an innovative NR-ISA metric called `HVS-MaxPol' that (a) requires\nminimal computational cost, (b) produce high correlation accuracy with image\nblurriness, and (c) scales to assess synthetic and natural image blur.\nSpecifically, the synthetic blur images are constructed by blurring the raw\nimages using Gaussian filter, while natural blur is observed from real-life\napplication such as motion, out-of-focus, etc. Furthermore, we create a natural\nbenchmark database in digital pathology for validation of image focus quality\nin whole slide imaging systems called `FocusPath' consisting of 864 blurred\nimages. Thorough experiments are designed to test and validate the efficiency\nof HVS-MaxPol across different blur databases and state-of-the-art NR-ISA\nmetrics.

Authentication accuracy deteriorates as users' behaviors\nchange as a result of mood, age, a change of routine, etc. Current\nauthentication systems handle failed authentication attempts by locking the\nusers out of their mobile devices. It is unsuitable for IA whose accuracy\ndeterioration induces a high false reject rate, rendering the IA system\nunusable.

We searched for H$_2$S, CS, SO,\nand SO$_2$ in the dense disk around GG Tau A with the NOrthem Extended\nMillimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer. We detected H$_2$S emission from the\ndense and cold ring orbiting around GG Tau A. This is the first detection of\nH$_2$S in a protoplanetary disk. We also detected HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, and\nDCO$^+$ in the disk. Upper limits for other molecules, CCS, SO$_2$, SO,\nHC$_3$N, and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ are also obtained. The observed DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$\nratio is similar to those in other disks. The observed column densities,\nderived using our radiative transfer code DiskFit, are then compared with those\nfrom our chemical code Nautilus. The column densities are in reasonable\nagreement for DCO$^{+}$, CS, CCS, and SO$_2$. For H$_2$S and SO, our predicted\nvertical integrated column densities are more than a factor of 10 higher than\nthe measured values. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that only a strong\nsulfur depletion may explain the low observed H$_2$S column density in the\ndisk. The H$_2$S detection in GG Tau A is most likely linked to the much larger\nmass of this disk compared to that in other T Tauri systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 03:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

We introduce a novel Adaptive Temporal Encoding\nNetwork (ATEN) that alternatively performs temporal encoding among key frames\nand flow-guided feature propagation from other consecutive frames between two\nkey frames. Specifically, ATEN first incorporates a Parsing-RCNN to produce the\ninstance-level parsing result for each key frame, which integrates both the\nglobal human parsing and instance-level human segmentation into a unified\nmodel. To balance between accuracy and efficiency, the flow-guided feature\npropagation is used to directly parse consecutive frames according to their\nidentified temporal consistency with key frames. On the other hand, ATEN\nleverages the convolution gated recurrent units (convGRU) to exploit temporal\nchanges over a series of key frames, which are further used to facilitate the\nframe-level instance-level parsing. By alternatively performing direct feature\npropagation between consistent frames and temporal encoding network among key\nframes, our ATEN achieves a good balance between frame-level accuracy and time\nefficiency, which is a common crucial problem in video object segmentation\nresearch. To demonstrate the superiority of our ATEN, extensive experiments are\nconducted on the most popular video segmentation benchmark (DAVIS) and a newly\ncollected Video Instance-level Parsing (VIP) dataset, which is the first video\ninstance-level human parsing dataset comprised of 404 sequences and over 20k\nframes with instance-level and pixel-wise annotations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 04:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 09:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

Visual and inertial fusion is a popular technology for 6-DOF\nstate estimation in recent years. Time instants at which different sensors'\nmeasurements are recorded are of crucial importance to the system's robustness\nand accuracy. In practice, timestamps of each sensor typically suffer from\ntriggering and transmission delays, leading to temporal misalignment (time\noffsets) among different sensors. Such temporal offset dramatically influences\nthe performance of sensor fusion. To this end, we propose an online approach\nfor calibrating temporal offset between visual and inertial measurements. Our\napproach achieves temporal offset calibration by jointly optimizing time\noffset, camera and IMU states, as well as feature locations in a SLAM system.\nFurthermore, the approach is a general model, which can be easily employed in\nseveral feature-based optimization frameworks. Simulation and experimental\nresults demonstrate the high accuracy of our calibration approach even compared\nwith other state-of-art offline tools. The VIO comparison against other methods\nproves that the online temporal calibration significantly benefits\nvisual-inertial systems. The source code of temporal calibration is integrated\ninto our public project, VINS-Mono.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 07:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

This essential property of the\nquantum states could be fragile under the influence of the quantum operations.\nThe extent to which quantum coherence is diminished depends both on the channel\nand the incoherent basis. Motivated by this, we propose a measure of\nnonclassicality of a quantum channel as the average quantum coherence of the\nstate space after the channel acts on, minimized over all orthonormal basis\nsets of the state space. Utilizing the squared $l_1$-norm of coherence for the\nqubit channels, the minimization can be treated analytically and the proposed\nmeasure takes a closed form of expression. If we allow the channels to act\nlocally on a maximally entangled state, the quantum correlation is diminished\nmaking the states more classical. We show that the extent to which quantum\ncorrelation is preserved under local action of the channel cannot exceed the\nquantumness of the underlying channel.

We show numerically and analytically that this parameter\ndetermines a true phase transition (somewhat reminiscent of phase separation in\na binary mixture) between a well-mixed and a segregated state. Additionally,\nminority convictions segregate faster and inter-specific aversion alone may\nlead to a segregation threshold with similar properties.

Shock surface\nfluctuations have been object of many observational and theoretical studies,\nand are known to be important for electron acceleration. We employ a\ncombination of hybrid Particle-In-Cell and test-particle methods to study how\nshock surface fluctuations influence the acceleration of suprathermal electrons\nin fully three dimensional simulations, and we give a complete comparison for\nthe 2D and 3D cases. A range of different quasi-perpendicular shocks in 2D and\n3D is examined, over a range of parameters compatible with the ones observed in\nthe solar wind.

These behaviors are at odds with the small diamagnetic response of\nmacroscopic gold samples. Here we theoretically investigate the possibility\nthat the observed unusual magnetism in capped gold nanoparticles is of orbital\norigin. Employing semiclassical techniques, we calculate the orbital component\nto the zero-field susceptibility of individual as well as ensembles of metallic\nnanoparticles. While the result for the orbital response of individual\nnanoparticles can exceed by orders of magnitude the bulk Landau susceptibility\nin absolute value, and can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic depending on\nnanoparticle size, we show that the magnetic susceptibility of a noninteracting\nensemble of nanoparticles with a smooth size distribution is always\nparamagnetic at low magnetic fields. In particular, we predict that the\nzero-field susceptibility follows a Curie-type law for small nanoparticle sizes\nand/or low temperatures. The calculated field-dependent magnetization of an\nensemble of diluted nanoparticles is shown to be in good agreement with\nexisting experiments that yielded a large paramagnetic response. The width of\nthe size distribution of the nanoparticles is identified as a key element for\nthe quantitative determination of the orbital response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 13:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

We explain the conditions under which the scheme provides an accurate\ndescription of CWLM.\n  We restrict ourselves to a qubit non-demolition measurement. The qubit is\ninitially in an equal-weight superposition of two quantum states. In the course\nof time, the detector signal is accumulated and the superposition is destroyed.\nThe times required to resolve the quantum states and to destroy the\nsuperposition are of the same order. We prove numerically a rather counter\nintuitive fact: the average detector output conditioned on the final state does\nnot depend on time. It looks like from the very beginning, the qubit knows in\nwhich state it is. We study statistics of decision times where the decision\ntime is defined as time required for the density matrix along a certain\ntrajectory to reach a threshold where it is close to one of the resulting\nstates. This statistics is useful to estimate how fast a decisive CWLM can be.\nBasing on this, we devise and study a simple feedback scheme that attempts to\nkeep the qubit in the equal-weight superposition. The detector readings are\nused to decide in which state the qubit is and which correction rotation to\napply to bring it back to the superposition. We show how to optimize the\nfeedback parameters and move towards more efficient feedback schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 14:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-03"}

We first consider a conventional network\nenergy efficiency maximization (EEmax) problem by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit beamformers and antennas selected to be used in transmission. We also\naccount for per-antenna maximum power constraints to avoid non-linear\ndistortion in power amplifiers and user-specific minimum rate constraints to\nguarantee certain service levels and fairness. To be energy-efficient, transmit\nantenna selection is employed. It eventually leads to a mixed-Boolean\nfractional program. We then propose two different approaches to solve this\ndifficult problem. The first solution is based on a novel modeling technique\nthat produces a tight continuous relaxation. The second approach is based on\nsparsity-inducing method, which does not require the introduction of any\nBoolean variable. We also investigate the trade-off between the energy\nefficiency and sum rate by proposing two different formulations. In the first\nformulation, we propose a new metric that is the ratio of the sum rate and the\nso-called weighted power. Specifically, this metric reduces to EEmax when the\nweight is 1, and to sum rate maximization when the weight is 0. In the other\nmethod, we treat the trade-off problem as a multi-objective optimization for\nwhich a scalarization approach is adopted. Numerical results illustrate\nsignificant achievable energy efficiency gains over the method where the\nantenna selection is not employed. The effect of antenna selection on the\nenergy efficiency and sum rate trade-off is also demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 15:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

ZSL classifies instances of unseen\nclasses, from which no training data is available, by utilizing the attributes\nof the classes. Conventional ZSL methods have equally dealt with all the\navailable attributes, but this sometimes causes misclassification. This is\nbecause an attribute that is effective for classifying instances of one class\nis not always effective for another class. In this case, a metric of\nclassifying the latter class can be undesirably influenced by the irrelevant\nattribute. This paper solves this problem by taking the importance of each\nattribute for each class into account when calculating the metric.

It\ncontains 22 classes of poses performed by 10 subjects with 31 IMU sensors\nacross full body.
