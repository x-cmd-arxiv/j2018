On one hand a crowded train car presents a negative\nexperience for the passengers, while on the other hand it indicated\ninefficiencies in the train system. The Federal Transit Agency is interested in\nreducing the crowding level on public transit train cars. Automatic passenger\ncounters (APC) are commonly used to count the passengers boarding and alighting\nthe train cars. Advanced APC solutions are available based on EO/IR sensors and\nvisual object detection technology, but are considerably expensive for large\nscale deployment. This report discusses a low-cost approach to APC by using\naccelerometer measurements from train car to estimate approximate passenger\nloading. Accelerometer sensor can measure train car vibration as the train\nmoves along the rail tracks. The train car vibration changes with the passenger\nloading on the car.

This kernel includes the parametrized differential operators applied to\na prior covariance kernel. We extend this framework to linear space-fractional\ndifferential equations. The methodology is compatible with a wide variety of\nfractional operators in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and stationary covariance kernels,\nincluding the Matern class, and can optimize the Matern parameter during\ntraining. We provide a user-friendly and feasible way to perform fractional\nderivatives of kernels, via a unified set of d-dimensional Fourier integral\nformulas amenable to generalized Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.\n  The implementation of fractional derivatives has several benefits. First, it\nallows for discovering fractional-order PDEs for systems characterized by heavy\ntails or anomalous diffusion, bypassing the analytical difficulty of fractional\ncalculus. Data sets exhibiting such features are of increasing prevalence in\nphysical and financial domains. Second, a single fractional-order archetype\nallows for a derivative of arbitrary order to be learned, with the order itself\nbeing a parameter in the regression. This is advantageous even when used for\ndiscovering integer-order equations; the user is not required to assume a\n\"dictionary\" of derivatives of various orders, and directly controls the\nparsimony of the models being discovered.

In this work, we present an approach based on disentangled\nrepresentation for producing diverse outputs without paired training images. To\nachieve diversity, we propose to embed images onto two spaces: a\ndomain-invariant content space capturing shared information across domains and\na domain-specific attribute space. Our model takes the encoded content features\nextracted from a given input and the attribute vectors sampled from the\nattribute space to produce diverse outputs at test time. To handle unpaired\ntraining data, we introduce a novel cross-cycle consistency loss based on\ndisentangled representations. Qualitative results show that our model can\ngenerate diverse and realistic images on a wide range of tasks without paired\ntraining data. For quantitative comparisons, we measure realism with user study\nand diversity with a perceptual distance metric.

The leading twist cross\nsection for this process contains convolutions of the corresponding single\nhadron FFs on one side and the DiFFs for the hadron pair on the other side,\nwhich furnishes several interesting new opportunities. A measurement of the\nunpolarized cross section with a number of different types of observed hadrons\nwill help in untangling the quark flavor dependence of the unpolarized DiFFs,\nwhen the results are analyzed together with the inclusive measurements of\ndihadron pairs, such as those recently performed by the $\\texttt{BELLE}$\ncollaboration.

The stacks at $z<0.9$ have luminosity limits as low as\n$10^{40}-10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, a regime in which X-ray binaries (XRBs) can\ndominate the X-ray emission. Comparing the measured luminosities to established\nXRB scaling relations, we find that the redshift evolution of the luminosity\nper star formation rate (SFR) of XRBs depends sensitively on the assumed\nobscuration and may be weaker than previously found. The XRB scaling relation\nbased on stacks from the Chandra Deep Field South overestimates the XRB\ncontribution to the COSMOS high specific SFR (sSFR) stacks, possibly due to a\nbias affecting the CDF-S stacks because of their small galaxy samples. After\nsubtracting the estimated XRB contribution from the stacks, we find that most\nstacks at $z>1.3$ exhibit a significant X-ray excess indicating nuclear\nemission. The AGN emission is strongly correlated with stellar mass but does\nnot exhibit an additional correlation with SFR. The hardness ratios of the\nhigh-redshift stacks indicate that the AGN are substantially obscured\n($N_{\\mathrm{H}}\\sim10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$).

Sequences of these modes are parameterized by the\nangular momentum of the black hole. The quasinormal and total-transmission\nmodes are usually distinct, having mode frequencies that are different at any\ngiven value of the angular momentum. But a discrete and countably infinite\nsubset of the left-total-transmission modes are simultaneously quasinormal\nmodes. Most of these special modes exist along previously unknown branches of\nthe gravitational total-transmission modes. In this paper, we give detailed\nplots of the total-transmission modes for harmonic indices $\\ell=[2,7]$, with\nspecial emphasis given to the $m=0$ modes which all contain previously unknown\nbranches. All of these unknown branches have purely imaginary mode frequencies.\nWe find that as we approach the Schwarzschild limit along these new branches,\nthe mode frequencies approach $-i\\infty$ in stark contrast to the finite mode\nfrequency obtained in the Schwarzschild limit along the previously known\nbranches. We explain when and why, at certain frequencies, the\nleft-total-transmission modes are simultaneously quasinormal modes. At these\nsame frequencies, the right-total-transmission modes are missing.

This echo views eta Car from latitudes near the equator, so the\nhigh speed does not trace a collimated polar jet aligned with the Homunculus.\nCombined with fast material in the Outer Ejecta, it indicates a wide-angle\nexplosive outflow.

This echo shows a steady decline over a\ndecade, sampling the 1850s plateau of the eruption. Spectra show the bulk\noutflow speed increasing from 150 km/s at early times, up to 600 km/s in the\nplateau. Later phases also develop remarkably broad emission wings indicating\nmass accelerated to more than 10,000 km/s. Together with other clues, this\nprovides direct evidence for an explosive ejection. This is accompanied by a\ntransition from narrow absorption lines to emission lines, often with broad P\nCygni profiles. These changes imply that the pre-1845 luminosity spikes are\ndistinct from the 1850s plateau. The key reason for this change may be that\nshock interaction dominates the plateau. The spectral evolution of eta Car\nclosely resembles that of UGC2773-OT, which had clear signatures of shock\ninteraction. We propose a 2-stage scenario for eta Car's eruption: (1) a slow\noutflow in the decades before the eruption, driven by binary interaction that\nproduced a dense equatorial outflow, followed by (2) explosive energy injection\nthat drove CSM interaction, powering the plateau and sweeping slower CSM into a\nfast shell that became the Homunculus. We discuss how this sequence could arise\nfrom a stellar merger in a triple system, leaving the eccentric binary seen\ntoday.

By normal, we mean that the\nfluctuations of stress, as averaged over spherical domains, decay as the\ninverse domain volume. Since this property is required for macroscopic stress\nto be self-averaging, it is expected to hold generically in all glasses and we\nthus conclude that the presence of $1/r^3$ stress correlation tails is the rule\nin these systems. Our proof follows from the observation that, in an infinite\nmedium, when both material isotropy and mechanical balance hold, (i) the stress\nautocorrelation matrix is completely fixed by just two radial functions: the\npressure autocorrelation and the trace of the autocorrelation of stress\ndeviators; furthermore, these two functions (ii) fix the decay of the\nfluctuations of sphere-averaged pressure and deviatoric stresses for windows of\nincreasing volume. Our conclusion is reached because, due to the precise\nanalytic relation (i) fixed by isotropy and mechanical balance, the constraints\narising via (ii) from the normality of stress fluctuations demand the spatially\nanisotropic stress correlation terms to decay as $1/r^3$ at long-range.

We propose a method which infers mobility behaviors in two stages:\nfrom Wi-Fi signals to trajectories and from trajectories to the mobility\nbehaviors. We evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach using the\nStudentLife dataset which contains Wi-Fi, GPS, and accelerometer measurements\ncollected from smartphones of 49 students within a three-month period. The\nexperimental results indicate that there is high correlation between stability\nof Wi-Fi signals and mobility activity. This unique characteristic provides\nsufficient evidences to extend the proposed idea to mobility analytics of\ngroups of people in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 21:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-06"}

The new method incorporates spatial\ncontextual information to the abundances in extended linear mixing models by\nusing a multiscale transform based on superpixels. The proposed method results\nin a fast algorithm that solves the abundance estimation problem only once in\neach scale during each iteration. Simulation results using synthetic and real\nimages compare the performances, both in accuracy and execution time, of the\nproposed algorithm and other state-of-the-art solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 23:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 13:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 14:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

However, it also presents a problem: each\nhierarchical level adds a new source of assembly errors, and substantially\nincreases the information required for proper assembly. This seems to conflict\nwith the prevalence of naturally occurring hierarchical structures, suggesting\nthat a common mechanical source of hierarchical robustness may exist. However,\nour ability to identify such a unifying phenomenon is limited by the lack of a\ngeneral mechanical framework for structures exhibiting organization on\ndisparate length scales.

Different categories of methods have\nbeen proposed to solve MOD. One of the challenges is to separate moving objects\nfrom illumination changes and shadows that are present in most real world\nvideos. State-of-the-art methods that can handle illumination changes and\nshadows work in a batch mode; thus, these methods are not suitable for long\nvideo sequences or real-time applications. In this paper, we propose an\nextension of a state-of-the-art batch MOD method (ILISD) to an\nonline/incremental MOD using unsupervised and generative neural networks, which\nuse illumination invariant image representations. For each image in a sequence,\nwe use a low-dimensional representation of a background image by a neural\nnetwork and then based on the illumination invariant representation, decompose\nthe foreground image into: illumination change and moving objects. Optimization\nis performed by stochastic gradient descent in an end-to-end and unsupervised\nfashion. Our algorithm can work in both batch and online modes. In the batch\nmode, like other batch methods, optimizer uses all the images. In online mode,\nimages can be incrementally fed into the optimizer. Based on our experimental\nevaluation on benchmark image sequences, both the online and the batch modes of\nour algorithm achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on most data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 02:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-06"}

Using Twitter as a corpus of free-form, unsupervised interactions, we\nidentified 40 independent Twitter users who tweeted abusively or non-abusively\nat one of two high-profile robots with Twitter accounts (TMI's Bina48 and\nHanson Robotics' Sophia).

The findings thus suggest that disinhibition towards robots is not\nnecessarily a pervasive tendency, but rather one driven by individual\ndifferences in antisociality.

It is challenging because of occlusion, illumination, and\nviewpoint change in camera views. Recently, multi-shot person re-id task\nreceives more attention since it is closer to real-world application. A key\npoint of a good algorithm for multi-shot person re-id is the temporal\naggregation of the person appearance features. While most of the current\napproaches apply pooling strategies and obtain a fixed-size vector\nrepresentation, these may lose the matching evidence between examples. In this\nwork, we propose the idea of visual distributional representation, which\ninterprets an image set as samples drawn from an unknown distribution in\nappearance feature space. Based on the supervision signals from a downstream\ntask of interest, the method reshapes the appearance feature space and further\nlearns the unknown distribution of each image set. In the context of multi-shot\nperson re-id, we apply this novel concept along with Wasserstein distance and\nlearn a distributional set distance function between two image sets. In this\nway, the proper alignment between two image sets can be discovered naturally in\na non-parametric manner.

Drawing\ninspiration from human cognition, where the annotators use a 3D CAD model as\nstructural reference to acquire ground-truth viewpoints for real images; we\npropose an iterative Semantic Pose Alignment Network, called iSPA-Net. Our\napproach focuses on exploiting semantic 3D structural regularity to solve the\ntask of fine-grained pose estimation by predicting viewpoint difference between\na given pair of images. Such image comparison based approach also alleviates\nthe problem of data scarcity and hence enhances scalability of the proposed\napproach for novel object categories with minimal annotation.

An important\nbenchmark for hillclimbing algorithms on pseudo-Boolean functions $f: \\{0,1\\}^n\n\\to \\mathbb{R}$ are (strictly) montone functions, on which a surprising number\nof hillclimbers fail to be efficient. For example, the $(1+1)$-Evolutionary\nAlgorithm is a standard hillclimber which flips each bit independently with\nprobability $c/n$ in each round. Perhaps surprisingly, this algorithm shows a\nphase transition: it optimizes any monotone pseudo-boolean function in\nquasilinear time if $c<1$, but there are monotone functions for which the\nalgorithm needs exponential time if $c>2.2$. But so far it was unclear whether\nthe threshold is at $c=1$.\n  In this paper we show how Moser's entropy compression argument can be adapted\nto this situation, that is, we show that a long runtime would allow us to\nencode the random steps of the algorithm with less bits than their entropy.\nThus there exists a $c_0 > 1$ such that for all $0<c\\le c_0$ the\n$(1+1)$-Evolutionary Algorithm with rate $c/n$ finds the optimum in $O(n \\log^2\nn)$ steps in expectation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 09:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-06"}

Assuming\nthat the atoms are independent, such a clock would benefit from a $\\sqrt{N}$\nenhancement in its stability, associated with the improved signal-to-noise\nratio of a large atom number $N$. An interesting question, however, is what\ntype of atomic interactions might affect the clock dynamics, and whether these\ninteractions are deleterious or could even be beneficial. In this work, we\ninvestigate the effect of dipole-dipole interactions, in which atoms excited\nduring the clock protocol emit and re-absorb photons. Taking a simple system\nconsisting of a 1D atomic array, we find that dipole-dipole interactions in\nfact result in an open quantum system exhibiting critical dynamics, as a set of\ncollective excitations acquires a decay rate approaching zero in the\nthermodynamic limit due to subradiance. A first consequence is that the decay\nof atomic excited population at long times exhibits a slow power-law behavior,\ninstead of the exponential expected for non-interacting atoms. We also find\nthat excitations among the atoms exhibit fermionic spatial correlations at long\ntimes, due to the microscopic properties of the multi-excitation subradiant\nstates. Interestingly, these properties cannot be captured by mean-field\ndynamics, suggesting the strongly interacting nature of this system. We finally\ncharacterize the time-dependent frequency shift in the atomic frequency\nmeasurement, and find that it is dominated by the interaction energy of\nsubradiant states at long times. Furthermore, we show that the decay of the\nclock signal displays at long times a non-exponential behavior, which might be\nuseful to improve the uncertainty limit with which the atomic frequency can be\nresolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 09:52:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 17:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

Moreover, there exist input-agnostic noise, called\nUniversal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) that can affect inference of the\nmodels over most input samples. Given a model, there exist broadly two\napproaches to craft UAPs: (i) data-driven: that require data, and (ii)\ndata-free: that do not require data samples. Data-driven approaches require\nactual samples from the underlying data distribution and craft UAPs with high\nsuccess (fooling) rate. However, data-free approaches craft UAPs without\nutilizing any data samples and therefore result in lesser success rates. In\nthis paper, for data-free scenarios, we propose a novel approach that emulates\nthe effect of data samples with class impressions in order to craft UAPs using\ndata-driven objectives.

To deal with general graphs, two\nsimplifying procedures were developed: regrouping of paths into families of\npaths and the separation of a large graph into subgraphs. However, for less\nsymmetrical graphs with complicated topologies as, for instance, random graphs,\nit can become cumbersome to choose the subgraphs and the families of paths. In\nthis work, an even more general procedure to construct the energy domain GF for\na quantum graph based on its adjacency matrix is presented. This new\nconstruction allows us to obtain the secular determinant, unraveling a unitary\nequivalence between the scattering Schr\\\"odinger approach and the Green's\nfunction approach. It also enables us to write a trace formula based on the\nGreen's function approach.

The idea is based on the\nprecoding of the data symbols using symplectic finite Fourier transform (SFFT)\nthen transmitting them by mean of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM) waveform. Consequently, the demodulator and channel equalization can be\ncoupled in one processing step. As a distinguished feature, the demodulated\ndata symbols have roughly equal gain independent of the channel selectivity. On\nthe other hand, generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) modulation\nalso employs the spreading over the time and frequency domains using circular\nfiltering. Accordingly, the data symbols are implicitly precoded in a similar\nway as applying SFFT in OTFS. In this paper, we present an extended\nrepresentation of GFDM which shows that OTFS can be processed as a GFDM signal\nwith simple permutation. Nevertheless, this permutation is the key factor\nbehind the outstanding performance of OTFS in LTV channels, as demonstrated in\nthis work. Furthermore, the representation of OTFS in the GFDM framework\nprovides an efficient implementation, that has been intensively investigated\nfor GFDM, and facilitates the understanding of the OTFS distinct features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 11:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

We study this problem by situating human\nsubjects as nodes on a network, and endowing each with a role, either regular\n(with the goal of achieving consensus among all regular players), or\nadversarial (aiming to prevent consensus among regular players). We show that\nadversarial nodes are, indeed, quite successful in preventing consensus.\nHowever, we demonstrate that having the ability to communicate among network\nneighbors can considerably improve coordination success, as well as resilience\nto adversarial nodes. Our analysis of communication suggests that adversarial\nnodes attempt to exploit this capability for their ends, but do so in a\nsomewhat limited way, perhaps to prevent regular nodes from recognizing their\nintent. In addition, we show that the presence of trusted nodes generally has\nlimited value, but does help when many adversarial nodes are present and\nplayers can communicate. Finally, we use experimental data to develop a\ncomputational model of human behavior, and explore a number of additional\nparametric variations, such as features of network topologies, using the\nresulting data-driven agent-based model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 12:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-06"}

The star, located at a distance of 5.9 pc, is the\nprimary of the high proper motion binary system containing vB 10, a star with\none of the lowest masses known in most of the twentieth century.

The\navailable CARMENES data are augmented by archival Doppler measurements from\nHIRES and HARPS. Altogether, the RVs span more than 16 years.

Without this\ncrucial knowledge, it is difficult to train reliable classifiers able to\neffectively classify novel, out-of-sample repackaged malware. To circumvent\nthis problem, we argue that reliable classifiers can be trained to detect\nrepackaged malware, if they are allowed to request new, more accurate\nrepresentations of an app's behavior. This learning technique is referred to as\nactive learning.\n  In this paper, we propose the usage of active learning to train classifiers\nable to cope with the ambiguous nature of repackaged malware.

Uncertainty\nestimates for the predictions would permit subsequent revision by clinicians.\nWe present the first exploration of multiple uncertainty estimates based on\nMonte Carlo (MC) dropout [4] in the context of deep networks for lesion\ndetection and segmentation in medical images.

The key challenge is to address the opaque\nnature of the language interoperability interface: one language calling\nprocedures in a second (which may call a third, or even back to the first),\nresulting in a potentially tangled, inefficient and insecure codebase. An\narchitecture is proposed for lightweight static analysis of large multilingual\ncodebases: the MLSA architecture. Its modular and table-oriented structure\naddresses the open-ended nature of multiple languages and language\ninteroperability APIs. We focus here as an application on the construction of\ncall-graphs that capture both inter-language and intra-language calls.

The\ntrajectory of the distracted driver vehicle is thus evaluated and projected,\nfor the given time steps, for the established distraction time, over the actual\ntrajectories of other vehicles. Every occurring crash is then evaluated in\nterms of energy involved in the crash, or with any other severity index (which\ncan be easily calculated since the accident dynamics can be accurately\nsimulated). The simulation of a driver error allows not only the typology of\ncrashes to be included, normally accounted for with surrogate safety measures,\nbut also many other type of typical crashes that it is impossible to simulate\nwith microsimulation and traditional methodologies being caused by vehicles who\nare driving on non-conflicting trajectories such as drivers speeding at a red\nlight, drivers taking the wrong lane or side of the street or just driving off\nthe road in isolated accidents against external obstacles or traffic barriers.\nThe total crash energy of all crashes is proposed as an indicator of risk and\nadopted in the case studies.

Matching persons\nacross disjoint camera views in their video fragments is inherently challenging\ndue to the large visual variations and uncontrolled frame rates. There are two\nsteps crucial to person re-id, namely discriminative feature learning and\nmetric learning. However, existing approaches consider the two steps\nindependently, and they do not make full use of the temporal and spatial\ninformation in videos. In this paper, we propose a Siamese attention\narchitecture that jointly learns spatiotemporal video representations and their\nsimilarity metrics. The network extracts local convolutional features from\nregions of each frame, and enhance their discriminative capability by focusing\non distinct regions when measuring the similarity with another pedestrian\nvideo.

Results turn out that: besides the\nhigh solar energy absorptivity of the first-layer, an optimum porosity of the\nsecond-layer porous material should be applied and the optimum porosity is\nabout 0.45 in this work. This optimum porosity is determined by the balance\nbetween the positive effect of the lowering effective thermal conductivity of\nthe second layer and the negative effect of the reduced vapor diffusivity in\nthe second layer when the porosity is decreased. The influence of the thermal\nconductivity of the second-layer porous material is negligible because the\neffective thermal conductivity of the second layer is determined by the\nporosity while a larger porosity means more water in the second layer.

To do so, we take the World\nWide Web as a paradigmatic example and emphasize the importance of\ndistinguishing the Web, made of printed documents, from a more abstract meaning\nentity, which we call the Quantum Web, or QWeb, where the former is considered\nto be the collection of traces that can be left by the latter, in specific\nmeasurements, similarly to how a non-spatial quantum entity, like an electron,\ncan leave localized traces of impact on a detection screen. The double-slit\nexperiment is extensively used to illustrate the rationale of the modeling,\nwhich is guided by how physicists constructed quantum theory to describe the\nbehavior of the microscopic entities. We also emphasize that the superposition\nprinciple and the associated interference effects are not sufficient to model\nall experimental probabilistic data, like those obtained by counting the\nrelative number of documents containing certain words and co-occurrences of\nwords. For this, additional effects, like context effects, must also be taken\ninto consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 08:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

It computes the ratio of the excess return over the\nstrategy standard deviation. However, the elements to compute the Sharpe ratio,\nnamely, the expected returns and the volatilities are unknown numbers and need\nto be estimated statistically. This means that the Sharpe ratio used by funds\nis subject to be error prone because of statistical estimation error. Lo\n(2002), Mertens (2002) derive explicit expressions for the statistical\ndistribution of the Sharpe ratio using standard asymptotic theory under several\nsets of assumptions (independent normally distributed - and identically\ndistributed returns). In this paper, we provide the exact distribution of the\nSharpe ratio for independent normally distributed return. In this case, the\nSharpe ratio statistic is up to a rescaling factor a non centered Student\ndistribution whose characteristics have been widely studied by statisticians.\nThe asymptotic behavior of our distribution provide the result of Lo (2002). We\nalso illustrate the fact that the empirical Sharpe ratio is asymptotically\noptimal in the sense that it achieves the Cramer Rao bound. We then study the\nempirical SR under AR(1) assumptions and investigate the effect of compounding\nperiod on the Sharpe (computing the annual Sharpe with monthly data for\ninstance). We finally provide general formula in this case of\nheteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 16:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 12:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 07:36:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 08:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

We propose to generate the parameters of FiLM layers going up the\nhierarchy of a convolutional network in a multi-hop fashion rather than all at\nonce, as in prior work.

To this end, we advocate isolating the\ndata and its computations in a trusted execution environment (TEE) on the edge,\nshielding them from the remaining edge software stack which we deem untrusted.\nThis approach faces two major challenges: (1) executing high-throughput,\nlow-delay stream analytics in a single TEE, which is constrained by a low\ntrusted computing base (TCB) and limited physical memory; (2) verifying\nexecution of stream analytics as the execution involves untrusted software\ncomponents on the edge. In response, we present StreamBox-TZ (SBT), a stream\nanalytics engine for an edge platform that offers strong data security,\nverifiable results, and good performance. SBT contributes a data plane designed\nand optimized for a TEE based on ARM TrustZone. It supports continuous remote\nattestation for analytics correctness and result freshness while incurring low\noverhead. SBT only adds 42.5 KB executable to the TCB (16% of the entire TCB).\nOn an octa core ARMv8 platform, it delivers the state-of-the-art performance by\nprocessing input events up to 140 MB/sec (12M events/sec) with sub-second\ndelay. The overhead incurred by SBT's security mechanism is less than 25%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 21:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 20:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

Instead of placing all functionality\ninto a single program, programs cooperate to complete tasks requested by users.\nHowever, untrusted programs may exploit interactions with other programs to\nobtain unauthorized access to system sensors either directly or through\nprivileged services. Researchers have proposed that programs should only be\nauthorized to access system sensors on a user-approved input event, but these\nmethods do not account for possible delegation done by the program receiving\nthe user input event. Furthermore, proposed delegation methods do not enable\nusers to control the use of their input events accurately. In this paper, we\npropose ENTRUST, a system that enables users to authorize sensor operations\nthat follow their input events, even if the sensor operation is performed by a\nprogram different from the program receiving the input event. ENTRUST tracks\nuser input as well as delegation events and restricts the execution of such\nevents to compute unambiguous delegation paths to enable accurate and reusable\nauthorization of sensor operations. To demonstrate this approach, we implement\nthe ENTRUST authorization system for Android. We find, via a laboratory user\nstudy, that attacks can be prevented at a much higher rate (54-64%\nimprovement); and via a field user study, that ENTRUST requires no more than\nthree additional authorizations per program with respect to the first-use\napproach, while incurring modest performance (<1%) and memory overheads (5.5 KB\nper program).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2018 21:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-17"}
