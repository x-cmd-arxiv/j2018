The idea is to extend the link between the\nAsymmetric Laplace distribution and the well-known univariate quantile\nregression model to a multivariate context, i.e. when a multivariate dependent\nvariable is concerned. The approach accounts for association among multiple\nresponses and study how the relationship between responses and explanatory\nvariables can vary across different quantiles of the marginal conditional\ndistribution of the responses.

Using single-crystal inelastic neutron\nscattering, we observed that the spectrum of magnetic excitations consists of\ntwo collective modes well separated in energy: 3D gapped magnons with a\nbandwidth of $\\sim$60 meV, associated with the antiferromagnetically (AFM)\nordered Fe subsystem, and quasi-1D AFM fluctuations of $\\sim$1 meV within the\nYb subsystem, with no hybridization of those modes. The spin dynamics of the Fe\nsubsystem changes very little through the SR transition and could be well\ndescribed in the frame of semiclassical linear spin-wave theory. On the other\nhand, the rotation of the net moment of the Fe subsystem at $T_{\\mathrm{SR}}$\ndrastically changes the excitation spectrum of the Yb subsystem, inducing the\ntransition between two regimes with magnon and spinon-like fluctuations. At $T\n< T_{\\mathrm{SR}}$, the Yb spin chains have a well defined field-induced\nferromagnetic (FM) ground state, and the spectrum consists of a sharp\nsingle-magnon mode, a two-magnon bound state, and a two-magnon continuum,\nwhereas at $T > T_{\\mathrm{SR}}$ only a gapped broad spinon-like continuum\ndominates the spectrum.

Directly leveraging our accelerated\n$\\ell_\\infty$ regression algorithms imply a $\\tilde{O}\\left(m +\n\\sqrt{mn}/\\epsilon\\right)$ runtime to compute an $\\epsilon$-approximate maximum\nflow for an undirected graph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices, generically\nimproving upon the previous best known runtime of\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(m/\\epsilon\\right)$ in [She17] whenever the graph is slightly\ndense. We further design an algorithm adapted to the structure of the\nregression problem induced by maximum flow obtaining a runtime of\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(m + \\max(n, \\sqrt{ns})/\\epsilon\\right)$, where $s$ is the\nsquared $\\ell_2$ norm of the congestion of any optimal flow. Moreover, we show\nhow to leverage this result to achieve improved exact algorithms for maximum\nflow on a variety of unit capacity graphs. We hope that our work serves as an\nimportant step towards achieving even faster maximum flow algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 17:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 17:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

In order to analyze the performance of the\nproposed algorithm, we study three different deployment scenarios based on\ndifferent spatial distributions of users and coverage areas. The results show\nthe superiority of our proposed NSGA-II algorithm for both cell planning and\njoint cell and backhaul planning to other well-known optimization algorithms.\nThe results also reveal that there is a trade-off between cell deployment costs\nand SINR/rate coverage, and W-BSs are placed in congested areas to consume less\nresources for wireless backhauls. Similarly, a trade-off between cell and fiber\ndeployment costs and SINR/rate coverage is observed in planning. We show that\nfor realistic scenarios desirable solutions can be selected from the Pareto\nfront of the introduced multi-objective problem based on given cellular\noperator policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 18:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 23:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-24"}

Here we introduce and demonstrate\nan entirely passive, noise-based approach for exploring intrinsic valley\ndynamics in atomically-thin transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD)\nsemiconductors. Exploiting the valley-specific optical selection rules in\nmonolayer TMDs, we use optical Faraday rotation to detect, under conditions of\nstrict thermal equilibrium, the stochastic thermodynamic fluctuations of the\nvalley polarization in a Fermi sea of resident carriers. Frequency spectra of\nthis spontaneous \"valley noise\" reveal narrow Lorentzian lineshapes and\ntherefore long exponentially-decaying intrinsic valley relaxation. Moreover,\nthe valley noise signals are shown to validate both the relaxation times and\nthe spectral dependence of conventional (perturbative) pump-probe measurements.\nThese results provide a viable route toward quantitative measurements of\nintrinsic valley dynamics, free from any external perturbation, pumping, or\nexcitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 19:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

Recent attacks have all\nexploited the underlying shared hardware. While practical, mounting such a\ncomplicated attack is still akin to listening on a private conversation in a\ncrowded train station. The attacker has to either perform significant manual\nlabor or use AI systems to automate the process. The recent academic literature\npoints to the latter option. With the abundance of cheap computing power and\nthe improvements made in AI, it is quite advantageous to automate such tasks.\nBy using AI systems however, malicious parties also inherit their weaknesses.\nOne such weakness is undoubtedly the vulnerability to adversarial samples.\n  In contrast to the previous literature, for the first time, we propose the\nuse of adversarial learning as a defensive tool to obfuscate and mask private\ninformation. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by first training\nCNNs and other machine learning classifiers on leakage trace of different\nprocesses. After training highly accurate models (99+% accuracy), we\ninvestigate their resolve against adversarial learning methods. By applying\nminimal perturbations to input traces, the adversarial traffic by the defender\ncan run as an attachment to the original process and cloak it against a\nmalicious classifier.\n  Finally, we investigate whether an attacker can protect her classifier model\nby employing adversarial defense methods, namely adversarial re-training and\ndefensive distillation. Our results show that even in the presence of an\nintelligent adversary that employs such techniques, all 10 of the tested\nadversarial learning methods still manage to successfully craft adversarial\nperturbations and the proposed cloaking methodology succeeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 20:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 01:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

Specifically, we look at how best to design\ndifferentially private protocols in a distributed setting, where each user\nholds a private datum. The literature has mostly considered two models: the\n\"central\" model, in which a trusted server collects users' data in the clear,\nwhich allows greater accuracy; and the \"local\" model, in which users\nindividually randomize their data, and need not trust the server, but accuracy\nis limited. Attempts to achieve the accuracy of the central model without a\ntrusted server have so far focused on variants of cryptographic MPC, which\nlimits scalability.\n  In this paper, we initiate the analytic study of a shuffled model for\ndistributed differentially private algorithms, which lies between the local and\ncentral models. This simple-to-implement model, a special case of the ESA\nframework of [Bittau et al., '17], augments the local model with an anonymous\nchannel that randomly permutes a set of user-supplied messages. For sum\nqueries, we show that this model provides the power of the central model while\navoiding the need to trust a central server and the complexity of cryptographic\nsecure function evaluation. More generally, we give evidence that the power of\nthe shuffled model lies strictly between those of the central and local models:\nfor a natural restriction of the model, we show that shuffled protocols for a\nwidely studied selection problem require exponentially higher sample complexity\nthan do central-model protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 00:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 04:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 19:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

The\nlevel of the reflecting layer was constrained to be at 570+/-30 mbar based on\nfitting strong ammonia lines at 5.32 microns.

We\nfound evidence for a strongly absorbing, but not totally opaque, cloud layer at\npressures deeper than 1.3 bar by combining Cassini/CIRS spectra of the GRS at\n7.18 microns with ground-based spectra at 5 microns. This is consistent with\nthe predicted level of an NH4SH cloud. We also constrained the vertical profile\nof water and ammonia. The GRS spectrum is matched by a saturated water profile\nabove an opaque water cloud at 5~bars. The pressure of the water cloud\nconstrains Jupiter's O/H ratio to be at least 1.1 times solar.

Could further gains in computational\nefficiency be achieved by guiding the search via measurements of a high\nperforming network with unknown detailed architecture (e.g. the primate visual\nsystem)? As one step toward this goal, we use representational similarity\nanalysis to evaluate the similarity of internal activations of candidate\nnetworks with those of a (fixed, high performing) teacher network. We show that\nadopting this evaluation metric could produce up to an order of magnitude in\nsearch efficiency over performance-guided methods. Our approach finds a\nconvolutional cell structure with similar performance as was previously found\nusing other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of\nmagnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times\nlower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS).

The pedestrian trajectories in the experiments are\nrecognized and rotated, and several aspects, e.g., the trajectory space\ndistribution, route length, travel time, velocity distribution, and\ntime-series, are investigated. It is found that: (1) Pedestrians prefer the\nright-hand side during the experiments; (2) The route length is as the law of\nlog-normal distribution, the route potential obeys the exponential\ndistribution, and the travel time is normally distributed as well as the speed;\n(3) Taking the short routes unexpectedly cost pedestrians plenty of travel\ntime, while detour seems to be a time-saving decision.

We consider\nthe theoretical properties and the phenomenological implications of a generic\ntwo Higgs doublet model (2HDM). This model constitutes a simple and attractive\nextension of the SM that is consistent with the observation of the SM-like\nHiggs boson and precision electroweak observables, while providing a potential\nnew source of CP-violation. In this paper we focus on the so-called Higgs\nalignment limit of the generic 2HDM, where the neutral scalar field~$H_1$, with\nthe tree-level couplings of the SM Higgs boson, is a mass eigenstate that is\naligned in field space with the direction of the Higgs vacuum expectation\nvalue. The properties of the two other heavier neutral Higgs scalars, $H_2$ and\n$H_3$, in the alignment limit of the 2HDM are also elucidated. It is shown that\nthe couplings of $H_2$ and $H_3$ in the alignment limit are tightly constrained\nand correlated. For example, in the exact alignment limit at tree level, for\nbosonic final states $\\text{BR}(H_{2,3} \\to W^+W^-, ZZ, H_1 Z) = 0$ and\n$\\text{BR}(H^\\pm \\to W^\\pm H_1) = 0$, whereas for fermionic final states\n$\\Gamma(H_2 \\to f\\bar f)/\\Gamma(H_3 \\to f\\bar f) \\sim M_2/M_3$ (where\n$M_\\alpha$ is the mass of $H_\\alpha$). In some cases, the results of the\nalignment limit differ depending on whether or not alignment is achieved via\nthe decoupling of heavy scalar states. In particular, in the exact alignment\nlimit without decoupling $\\text{BR}(H_{2,3}\\to H_1 H_1)=0$, whereas these\nbranching ratios are nonzero in the decoupling regime. Observables that could\nbe used to test the alignment scenario at the LHC are defined and discussed.\nThe couplings of the Higgs bosons away from their exact alignment values are\ndetermined to leading order, and some consequences are elucidated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 12:24:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 19:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 06:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 06:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Most of the theoretical approaches are based on the approximation of a\nrigid skyrmion.

Here, by taking\nadvantage of the Hilbert-Huang transform, we demonstrate that at least two\nthermal modes can be excited which are non-stationary in time. In addition, one\nlimit of the rigid skyrmion approximation is that this hypothesis does not\nallow for correctly describing the recent experimental evidence of skyrmion\nHall angle dependence on the amplitude of the driving force, which is\nproportional to the injected current. In this work, we show that, in an ideal\nsample, the combined effect of field-like and damping-like torques on a\nbreathing skyrmion can indeed give rise to such a current dependent skyrmion\nHall angle.

Although conceptually simple, the calculation of radial\ndistribution functions via distance binning requires the evaluation of\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ particle-pair distances where $N$ is the number of particles\nunder consideration. CADISHI provides fast parallel implementations of the\ndistance histogram algorithm for the CPU and the GPU, written in templated C++\nand CUDA. Orthorhombic and general triclinic periodic boxes are supported, in\naddition to the non-periodic case. The CPU kernels feature cache-blocking,\nvectorization and thread-parallelization to obtain high performance. The GPU\nkernels are tuned to exploit the memory and processor features of current GPUs,\ndemonstrating histogramming rates of up to a factor 40 higher than on a\nhigh-end multi-core CPU. To enable high-throughput analyses of molecular\ndynamics trajectories, the compute kernels are driven by the Python-based\nCADISHI engine.

The traditional method involves\nfirst estimating all the interfering channel strengths then optimizing the\nscheduling based on the model. This model-based method is however resource\nintensive and computationally hard because channel estimation is expensive in\ndense networks; furthermore, finding even a locally optimal solution of the\nresulting optimization problem may be computationally complex. This paper shows\nthat by using a deep learning approach, it is possible to bypass the channel\nestimation and to schedule links efficiently based solely on the geographic\nlocations of the transmitters and the receivers, due to the fact that in many\npropagation environments, the wireless channel strength is largely a function\nof the distance dependent path-loss. This is accomplished by unsupervised\ntraining over randomly deployed networks, and by using a novel neural network\narchitecture that computes the geographic spatial convolutions of the\ninterfering or interfered neighboring nodes along with subsequent multiple\nfeedback stages to learn the optimum solution. The resulting neural network\ngives near-optimal performance for sum-rate maximization and is capable of\ngeneralizing to larger deployment areas and to deployments of different link\ndensities. Moreover, to provide fairness, this paper proposes a novel\nscheduling approach that utilizes the sum-rate optimal scheduling algorithm\nover judiciously chosen subsets of links for maximizing a proportional fairness\nobjective over the network.

The proposed\nencoder-decoder framework is composed of a series of non-locally enhanced dense\nblocks that are designed to not only fully exploit hierarchical features from\nall the convolutional layers but also well capture the long-distance\ndependencies and structural information. Extensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively remove\nrain-streaks on rainy image of various densities while well preserving the\nimage details, which achieves significant improvements over the recent\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 15:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

If inflammation is recognized to favor the formation of vascular\nmetastatic niches, little is known about the contribution of blood rheology to\nCTC deposition. Herein, a microfluidic chip, covered by a confluent monolayer\nof endothelial cells, is used for analyzing the adhesion and rolling of\ncolorectal (HCT 15) and breast (MDA MB 231) cancer cells under different\nbiophysical conditions. These include the analysis of cell transport in a\nphysiological solution and whole blood; over a healthy and a TNF alpha inflamed\nendothelium; with a flow rate of 50 and 100 nL/min. Upon stimulation of the\nendothelial monolayer with TNF alpha (25 ng/mL), CTC adhesion increases by 2 to\n4 times whilst cell rolling velocity only slightly reduces. Notably, whole\nblood also enhances cancer cell deposition by 2 to 3 times, but only on the\nunstimulated vasculature. For all tested conditions, no statistically\nsignificant difference is observed between the two cancer cell types. Finally,\na computational model for CTC transport demonstrates that a rigid cell\napproximation reasonably predicts rolling velocities while cell deformability\nis needed to model adhesion. These results would suggest that, within\nmicrovascular networks, blood rheology and inflammation contribute similarly to\nCTC deposition thereby facilitating the formation of metastatic niches along\nthe entire network, including the healthy endothelium. In microfluidic based\nassays, neglecting blood rheology would significantly underestimate the\nmetastatic potential of cancer cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 08:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

We propose two\neasy-to-implement methods to estimate the noise strength parameter in the\ndenoising algorithm, and apply the denoising algorithm to GPS-based traffic\ndata from Beijing taxi system. For the traffic prediction problem, we combine\nneural network and history matching method for roads randomly chosen from an\nurban area of Beijing. Numerical experiments show that the predicting accuracy\nis improved significantly by applying the proposed bounded total variation\ndenoising algorithm. We also test the algorithm on clustering problem, where a\nrecently developed clustering analysis method is applied to more than one\nhundred urban road segments in Beijing based on their velocity profiles. Better\nclustering result is obtained after denoising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 13:37:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 08:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}
