This is motivated by the\nproblem of a government that wants to control the country's debt-to-GDP (gross\ndomestic product) ratio. In our formulation, the debt-to-GDP ratio evolves\nstochastically in continuous time, and its drift -- given by the interest rate\non government debt, net of the growth rate of GDP -- is affected by an\nexogenous macroeconomic risk process modelled by a continuous-time Markov chain\nwith $N$ states. The government can act on the public debt by increasing or\ndecreasing its level, and it aims at minimising a net expected regime-dependent\ncost functional. Without relying on a guess-and-verify approach, but performing\na direct probabilistic study, we show that it is optimal to keep the\ndebt-to-GDP ratio in an interval, whose boundaries depend on the states of the\nrisk process. These boundaries are given through a zero-sum optimal stopping\ngame with regime switching with $N$ states and are characterised through a\nsystem of nonlinear algebraic equations with constraints. To the best of our\nknowledge, such a result appears here for the first time. Finally, we put in\npractice our methodology in a case study of a Markov chain with $N=2$ states;\nwe provide a thorough analysis and we complement our theoretical results by a\ndetailed numerical study on the sensitivity of the optimal debt ratio\nmanagement policy with respect to the problem's parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 16:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 17:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 13:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

The applied model of the Galactic\ndisk and spiral arms, with the parameters defined by observational data and\nwith pattern speed $\\Omega_p=$28.0 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, is the same that\nallowed us to explain the origin of the Local Arm and the Sun's orbit trapped\ninside the corotation resonance (CR). We show that the $U-V$ picture of the SN\nconsists of the main component, associated with the CR, and the inner and outer\nstructures, which we could associate with the Hercules and Sirius streams,\nrespectively. The Coma-Berenices and Hyades-Pleiades groups and the Sun itself\nbelong to the main part. The substructures of Hercules are formed mainly by the\nnearby 8/1, 12/1, and even 6/1 inner Lindblad resonances, while Sirius is\nshaped by the bulk of overlapping outer Lindblad resonances, -8/1, -12/1,\n-16/1, which are stuck to the CR. This richness in resonances only exists near\ncorotation, which should be of the spiral arms, not of the Galactic bar, whose\nstable corotation zone is far away from the Sun.

A key tool is that $W_\\tau$ is skew-adjoint , and thus\ncan be characterized by a unique projection-valued measure, discrete by\ncompactness, and an associated orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. These\neigenfunctions can be ordered in terms of a Dirichlet energy on the RKHS, and\nprovide a notion of coherent observables under the dynamics akin to the Koopman\neigenfunctions associated with the atomic part of the spectrum.

The\nalternative of population model, however, faces challenges caused by the\nsignificant inter-subject variations within the ECG data. We address this\nchallenge by investigating for the first time the problem of learning\nrepresentations for clinically-informative variables while disentangling other\nfactors of variations within the ECG data.

To handle this\nchallenging task, organizations often use human analysts to classify events\nunder high uncertainty. Existing algorithms use a threshold-based mechanism to\ndecide whether to classify an object automatically or send it to an analyst for\ndeeper inspection. However, this approach leads to a significant waste of\nresources since it does not take the practical temporal constraints of system\nresources into account. Our contribution is threefold.

Then, in real-time, DeROL maps the current state of the one-shot learning\nprocess to operational actions based on the trained deep-Q network, to maximize\nthe objective function. Second, we develop the first open-source software for\npractical artificially intelligent one-shot classification systems with limited\nresources for the benefit of researchers in related fields.

We cast the design of adaptive CNNs as a hyper-parameter\noptimization problem with respect to energy, accuracy, and communication\nconstraints imposed by the mobile device. To efficiently solve this problem, we\nadapt Bayesian optimization to the properties of the design space, reaching\nnear-optimal configurations in few tens of function evaluations. Our method\nreduces the energy consumed for image classification on a mobile device by up\nto 6x, compared to the best previously published work that uses CNNs as\nblackboxes. Finally, we evaluate two image classification practices, i.e.,\nclassifying all images locally versus over the cloud under energy and\ncommunication constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2018 02:01:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 00:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

In current neuroscience literature, one of the most commonly\nused tools to extract and characterize brain functional networks is independent\ncomponent analysis (ICA). However, existing ICA methods are not suited for\nmodelling repeatedly measured imaging data. In this paper, we propose a novel\nlongitudinal independent component model (L-ICA) which provides a formal\nmodeling framework for extending ICA to longitudinal studies. By incorporating\nsubject-specific random effects and visit-specific covariate effects, L-ICA is\nable to provide more accurate estimates of changes in brain functional networks\non both the population- and individual-level, borrow information across\nrepeated scans within the same subject to increase statistical power in\ndetecting covariate effects on the networks, and allow for model-based\nprediction for brain networks changes caused by disease progression, treatment\nor neurodevelopment.

A TU-sharing rule is thus essential, as how players are rewarded\ndetermines their behavior. This work offers a new option for distributing\npartition function-based surpluses, dealing with cooperative game theory in\nterms of both global games and games in partition function form, namely lattice\nfunctions, while the sharing rule is a point-valued solution or value. The\nnovelty is grounded on the combinatorial definition of such solutions as\nlattice functions whose M\\\"obius inversion lives only on atoms, i.e. on the\nfirst level of the lattice. While simply rephrasing the traditional solution\nconcept for standard coalitional games, this leads to distribute the surplus\ngenerated by partitions across the edges of the network, as the atoms among\npartitions are unordered pairs of players. These shares of edges are further\ndivided between nodes, but the corresponding Shapley value is very different\nfrom the traditional one and leads to two alternative forms, obtained by\nfocusing either on marginal contributions along maximal chains, or else on the\nuniform division of Harsanyi dividends.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the symmetries of the CM and investigate the low energy\nflat band structure in the entire moir\\'e Brillouin zone near $\\theta_0$.\nInstead of observing flat bands at only one \"magic\" angle, we notice that the\nbands remain almost flat within a small range around $\\theta_0$, where multiple\ntopological transitions occur. The topological transitions are caused by the\ncreation and annihilation of Dirac nodes at either $\\text{K}$,\n$\\text{K}^\\prime$, or $\\Gamma$ points, or along the high symmetry lines in the\nmoir\\'e Brillouin zone. We trace the evolution of the nodes and find that there\nare several processes transporting them from $\\Gamma$ to $\\text{K}$ and\n$\\text{K}^\\prime$. At the $\\Gamma$ point, the lowest energy levels of the CM\nare doubly degenerate for some range of twisting angle around $\\theta_0$,\nsuggesting that the physics is not described by any two band model. Based on\nthis observation, we propose an effective six-band model (up to second order in\nquasi-momentum) near the $\\Gamma$ point with the full symmetries of the CM,\nwhich we argue is the minimal model that explains the motion of the Dirac nodes\naround $\\Gamma$ as the twist angle is varied. By fitting the coefficients from\nthe numerical results, we show that this six-band model captures the important\nphysics over a wide range of angles near the first \"magic\" angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2018 06:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 00:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

However, there are still some unsolved problems in this area.\nFor example, given a query video and a reference video, how to accurately\nlocalize a segment in the reference video such that the segment semantically\ncorresponds to the query video? We define a distinctively new task, namely\n\\textbf{video re-localization}, to address this scenario. Video re-localization\nis an important emerging technology implicating many applications, such as fast\nseeking in videos, video copy detection, video surveillance, etc. Meanwhile, it\nis also a challenging research task because the visual appearance of a semantic\nconcept in videos can have large variations. The first hurdle to clear for the\nvideo re-localization task is the lack of existing datasets. It is labor\nexpensive to collect pairs of videos with semantic coherence or correspondence\nand label the corresponding segments. We first exploit and reorganize the\nvideos in ActivityNet to form a new dataset for video re-localization research,\nwhich consists of about 10,000 videos of diverse visual appearances associated\nwith localized boundary information. Subsequently, we propose an innovative\ncross gated bilinear matching model such that every time-step in the reference\nvideo is matched against the attentively weighted query video. Consequently,\nthe prediction of the starting and ending time is formulated as a\nclassification problem based on the matching results.

Both models require the presence of two physical Higgs\nbosons $h_1$ and $h_2$ which come from mixed components of the standard Higgs\ndoublet $H$ and a complex singlet $S$. In the Vector model, the extra $U(1)$\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum of the complex field $S$. This\nleads to a massive gauge boson $X^\\mu$ that is a DM candidate stabilized by the\ndark charge conjugation symmetry $S \\to S^*$, $X^\\mu\\to -X^\\mu$. On the other\nhand, in the Scalar model the gauge group remains the standard one. The DM\nfield $A$ is the imaginary component of $S$ and the stabilizing symmetry is\nalso the dark charge conjugation $S \\to S^*$ ($A \\to - A$).

CNNs led to considerable improvements in\nthis field, and recent trends replaced the need for ground-truth labels with\ngeometry-guided image reconstruction signals enabling unsupervised training.\nCurrently, for this purpose, state-of-the-art techniques rely on images\nacquired with a binocular stereo rig to predict inverse depth (i.e., disparity)\naccording to the aforementioned supervision principle. However, these methods\nsuffer from well-known problems near occlusions, left image border, etc\ninherited from the stereo setup. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle these\nissues by moving to a trinocular domain for training. Assuming the central\nimage as the reference, we train a CNN to infer disparity representations\npairing such image with frames on its left and right side. This strategy allows\nobtaining depth maps not affected by typical stereo artifacts. Moreover, being\ntrinocular datasets seldom available, we introduce a novel interleaved training\nprocedure enabling to enforce the trinocular assumption outlined from current\nbinocular datasets. Exhaustive experimental results on the KITTI dataset\nconfirm that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised\nmonocular depth estimation trained on binocular stereo pairs as well as any\nknown methods relying on other cues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2018 12:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

The\nfunctional role of colour information in terms of its potential benefits to\nbehavioural success across the species is addressed in the introduction here to\nclarify why colour perception may have evolved to generate behavioural success.\nIt is argued that evolutionary and environmental pressures influence not only\ncolour trait production in the different species, but also their ability to\nprocess and exploit colour information for goal-specific purposes.

The distribution of open clusters\nin the 6D phase space is revisited with Gaia DR2. Methods. The weighted mean\nradial velocity of open clusters was determined, using the most probable\nmembers available from a previous astrometric investigation that also provided\nmean parallaxes and proper motions. Those parameters, all derived from Gaia DR2\nonly, were combined to provide the 6D phase space information of 861 clusters.\nThe velocity distribution of nearby clusters was investigated, as well as the\nspatial and velocity distributions of the whole sample as a function of age.

For the\nhigh quality sample that has 406 clusters, the median uncertainty of the\nweighted mean radial velocity is 0.5 km/s.

By analysing the progenitors of\ncentral and satellite model galaxies, we find that differences in the gas\ncontent arise after accretion, and can be entirely ascribed to the\ninstantaneous stripping of the hot gas reservoir. The suppression of cold gas\nreplenishment via cooling and star formation leads to a reduction of the cold\ngas and of its density. Therefore, more molecular gas is lost than lower\ndensity HI gas, and model satellites have less molecular gas and lower star\nformation rates than observed satellites. We argue that these disagreements\ncould be largely resolved with the inclusion of a proper treatment for\nram-pressure stripping of cold gas and a more gradual stripping of the hot gas\nreservoir.

However, obtaining an SS model of the targeted\nsystem is crucial for many LPV control synthesis methods, as these synthesis\ntools are almost exclusively formulated for the aforementioned representation\nof the system dynamics. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle the problem by\ncombining state-of-the-art LPV input-output (IO) identification methods with an\nLPV-IO to LPV-SS realization scheme and a maximum likelihood refinement step.\nThe resulting modular LPV-SS identification approach achieves statical\nefficiency with a relatively low computational load.

In particular light of the recent public excitement and ensuing\ndisappointment regarding the exotic \"EM drive\" it is worthwhile to point out\nthat propellantless space travel is eminently possible based on well\nestablished physical principles. Here a new mode of transport is proposed which\nrelies on electric-field moderated momentum exchange with the ionized particles\nin the interstellar medium. The application of this mechanism faces significant\nchallenges requiring industrial-scale exploitation of space but the\ntechnological roadblocks are different than those presented by light sails or\nparticle beam powered craft, and may be more easily addressed depending on the\nuncertain march of technology. This mode of space travel is well suited to\nenergy efficient travel at velocities less than or of order 0.05c and compares\nexceptionally well to light sails on an energy expenditure basis. It therefore\nrepresents an extremely attractive mode of transport for slow (~multi-century\nlong) voyages carrying massive payloads to nearby stellar neighbors. This would\nbe useful for missions that would otherwise be too energy intensive to carry\nout, such as transporting a generation ship or bulk materials for a future\ncolony around Alpha Cen A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2018 21:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 19:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

An iron core can easily move inside\nthe bore. One of the coils acts as primary and the other two are secondary\ncoils. Change in the position of the core due to surface peaks and valleys\ncauses the induced voltage in the secondary coils to vary. This change in the\nvoltage is a measure of core position and reveals the morphological features of\nthe surface (surface profile). Experiments show that the proposed sensor is\ncapable of discriminating between the models of two different types of skin\nlesions, namely, anetoderma and nodule, which resemble each other in visual\ninspection but behave differently when being touched.

It has recently been shown that disordered\nhyperuniform dielectric two-dimensional cellular network solids possess\ncomplete photonic band gaps comparable in size to photonic crystals, while at\nthe same time maintaining statistical isotropy, enabling waveguide geometries\nnot possible with photonic crystals. Motivated by these developments, we\nexplore other functionalities of various two-dimensional ordered and disordered\nhyperuniform cellular networks, including their effective thermal or electrical\nconductivities and elastic moduli. We establish the multifunctionality of a\nclass of such low-density networks by demonstrating that they maximize or\nvirtually maximize the effective conductivities and elastic moduli. This is\naccomplished using the machinery of homogenization theory, including optimal\nbounds and cross-property bounds, and statistical mechanics. We have identified\nordered and disordered hyperuniform low-weight cellular networks that are\nmultifunctional with respect to transport (e.g., heat dissipation and fluid\ntransport), mechanical and electromagnetic properties, which can be readily\nfabricated using 3D printing and lithographic technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2018 01:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

Every year, many people died and injured in traffic accidents\nrelated to sun glare. Providing accurate information about when and where sun\nglare happens would be helpful to prevent sun glare caused traffic accidents\nand save lives. In this study, we proposed to use publicly accessible Google\nStreet View (GSV) panorama images to estimate and predict the occurrence of sun\nglare. GSV images have view sight similar to drivers, which would make GSV\nimages suitable for estimating the visibility of sun glare to drivers. A\nrecently developed convolutional neural network algorithm was used to segment\nGSV images and predict obstructions on sun glare. Based on the predicted\nobstructions for given locations, we further estimated the time windows of sun\nglare by estimating the sun positions and the relative angles between drivers\nand the sun for those locations. We conducted a case study in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, USA. Results show that the method can predict the presence of\nsun glare precisely. The proposed method would provide an important tool for\ndrivers and traffic planners to mitigate the sun glare and decrease the\npotential traffic accidents caused by the sun glare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2018 11:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

ICMUP is itself a novel\napproach to information compression, couched in terms of non-mathematical\nprimitives, as is necessary in any investigation of the foundations of\nmathematics. This new perspective on the foundations of mathematics has grown\nout of an extensive programme of research developing the \"SP Theory of\nIntelligence\" and its realisation in the \"SP Computer Model\", a system in which\na generalised version of ICMUP -- the powerful concept of SP-multiple-alignment\n-- plays a central role. These ideas may be seen to be part of a \"Big Picture\"\ncomprising six areas of interest, with information compression as a unifying\ntheme. The paper describes the close relation between mathematics and\ninformation compression, and describes examples showing how variants of ICMUP\nmay be seen in widely-used structures and operations in mathematics. Examples\nare also given to show how the mathematics-related disciplines of logic and\ncomputing may be understood as ICMUP.
