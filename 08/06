Joint broadband spectral modeling of XRT and LAT data reveal that LAT\nnondetections of bright X-ray afterglows are consistent with a cooling break in\nthe inferred electron synchrotron spectrum below the LAT and/or XRT energy\nranges. Such a break is sufficient to suppress the high-energy emission so as\nto be below the LAT detection threshold.

That is, when a data set is\ndrawn from a manifold (possibly with noise), a meaningful aspect of the data is\nthe dimension of that manifold. Various approaches exist for estimating this\ndimension, such as the method of Secant-Avoidance Projection (SAP).\nIntuitively, the SAP algorithm seeks to determine a projection which best\npreserves the lengths of all secants between points in a data set; by applying\nthe algorithm to find the best projections to vector spaces of various\ndimensions, one may infer the dimension of the manifold of origination. That\nis, one may learn the dimension at which it is possible to construct a\ndiffeomorphic copy of the data in a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. Using\nWhitney's embedding theorem, we can relate this information to the natural\ndimension of the data. A drawback of the SAP algorithm is that a data set with\n$T$ points has $O(T^2)$ secants, making the computation and storage of all\nsecants infeasible for very large data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel\nalgorithm that generalizes the SAP algorithm with an emphasis on addressing\nthis issue.

We report a discovery of an ETG\n(SDSS J142055.01+400715.7) with Mstellar=10^10 Msun that offers direct evidence\nfor gas-rich merging as the origin of low-mass ETGs. The integrated properties\nof the galaxy are consistent with a typical low-mass ETG, but the outer and\ninner regions show distinct dispersion- and rotation-dominated kinematics,\nrespectively. There are some tidal features surrounding the galaxy. These two\nfacts suggest very recent galaxy merging. Furthermore, the inner disk harbors\non-going star formation, indicating the merging to be gas rich. This type of\ngalaxy is rare but it may be a demonstration of the role the transient phase of\ngas-rich merging plays in making a low-mass ETG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 04:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 10:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

In telemetry analyses, discrete-time\nstate-switching models (such as hidden Markov models) have been increasingly\npopular to identify behavioural phases from animal tracking data. We propose a\nmultistate formulation of the continuous-time correlated random walk, with an\nunderlying Markov process used as a proxy for the animal's behavioural state\nprocess.

As evidenced by a robust square-root-of-time Lucas-Washburn\n(L-W) filling kinetics, the capillary rise is governed by a balance of\ncapillarity and viscous drag forces in the absence of inertia and gravitational\neffects over the entire experimental times studied, ranging from a few seconds\nup to 10 days. A video on the infiltration process corroborates a collective\npore filling as well as pronounced imbibition front broadening resulting from\nthe capillarity and permeability disorder, typical of Vycor glasses. The\ntransport process is analyzed within a Darcy scale description, considering a\ngeneralized pre-factor of the L-W law, termed Lucas-Washburn-Darcy imbibition\nability. It assumes a Hagen-Poiseuille velocity profile in the pores and\ndepends on the porosity, the mean pore diameter, the tortuosity and the\nvelocity slip length and thus on the effective hydraulic pore diameter.

In\nthis paper, we propose to apply the lossy Saak transform to adversarially\nperturbed images as a preprocessing tool to defend against adversarial attacks.\nSaak transform is a recently-proposed state-of-the-art for computing the\nspatial-spectral representations of input images. Empirically, we observe that\noutputs of the Saak transform are very discriminative in differentiating\nadversarial examples from clean ones. Therefore, we propose a Saak transform\nbased preprocessing method with three steps: 1) transforming an input image to\na joint spatial-spectral representation via the forward Saak transform, 2)\napply filtering to its high-frequency components, and, 3) reconstructing the\nimage via the inverse Saak transform. The processed image is found to be robust\nagainst adversarial perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments to\ninvestigate various settings of the Saak transform and filtering functions.\nWithout harming the decision performance on clean images, our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods by a substantial\nmargin on both the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.

Their separation provides a deeper insight into\nBenson's algorithm, and points toward a dual approach. Two skeletal algorithms\nare defined which focus on the combinatorial part. Using different\nsingle-objective optimization problems - called oracle calls - yield different\nalgorithms, such as a sequential convex hull algorithm, another version of\nBenson's algorithm with the theoretically best possible iteration count, the\ndual algorithm of Ehrgott, L\\\"ohne and Shao, and the new algorithm. The new\nalgorithm has several advantages. First, the corresponding one-dimensional\noptimization problem uses the original constraints without adding any extra\nvariables or constraints. Second, its iteration count meets the theoretically\nbest possible one. As a dual algorithm, it is sequential: in each iteration it\nproduces an extremal solution, thus can be aborted when a satisfactory solution\nis found. The Pareto front can be \"probed\" or \"scanned\" from several directions\nat any moment without adversely affecting the efficiency. Finally, it is well\nsuited to handle highly degenerate problems where there are many linear\ndependencies among the constraints.

While the private-message capacity\nregion is well known to be achievable with dirty paper coding (DPC), we are\ninterested in the simpler linearly precoded transmission schemes. In\nparticular, we focus on linear precoding schemes combined with rate-splitting\n(RS). First, we derive an achievable rate region with minimum mean square error\n(MMSE) precoding at the transmitter and joint decoding of the sub-messages at\nthe receivers. Then, we study the achievable sum rate of this scheme and obtain\ntwo findings: 1) an analytically tractable upper bound on the sum rate that is\nshown numerically to be a close approximation, and 2) how to reduce the number\nof active streams -- crucial to the overall complexity -- while preserving the\nsum rate to within a constant loss. The latter results in two practical\nalgorithms: a stream elimination algorithm and a stream ordering algorithm.\nFinally, we investigate the constant-gap optimality of linearly precoded RS\nwith respect to the capacity. Our result reveals that, while the achievable\nrate of linear precoding alone can be arbitrarily far from the capacity, the\nintroduction of RS can help achieve the capacity region to within a constant\ngap in the two-user case.

Helio- and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of\nangular momentum from stellar radiation zones over the whole\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating\nstably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modeled and its\nstrength evaluated. Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent\ntransport is anisotropic. Only phenomenological prescriptions have been\nproposed for the transport in the horizontal direction, which however\nconstitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar\nhydrodynamics in evolution codes. We derive a new theoretical prescription for\nthe anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones using a spectral\nformalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification,\nrotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent\ntransport resulting from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of\nthe radial differential rotation is derived. We implement this framework in the\nstellar evolution code STAREVOL and quantify its impact on the rotational and\nstructural evolution of low-mass stars from the pre-main-sequence to the red\ngiant branch. The anisotropy of the turbulent transport scales as\n$N^4\\tau^2/\\left(2\\Omega^2\\right)$, $N$ and $\\Omega$ being the buoyancy and\nrotation frequencies respectively and $\\tau$ a time characterizing the source\nof turbulence. This leads to a horizontal turbulent transport of similar\nstrength in average that those obtained with previously proposed prescriptions\neven if it can be locally larger below the convective envelope. As a\nconsequence, a complementary transport mechanism like internal gravity waves or\nmagnetic fields is still needed to explain the observed strong transport of\nangular momentum along stellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 10:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Motivated by the structural\nanalogy between multi-resolution wavelet analysis and the pooling/unpooling\nlayers of CNNs, we introduce discrete wavelet transform (DWT) into the CNN\nencoder-decoder architecture and propose WCNN. The high-frequency wavelet\ncoefficients are computed at encoder, which are later used at the decoder to\nunpooled jointly with coarse-resolution feature maps through the inverse DWT.\nThe DWT/iDWT is further used to develop two wavelet pyramids to capture the\nglobal context, where the multi-resolution DWT is applied to successively\nreduce the spatial resolution and increase the receptive field.

Based on this approach,\nthe proposed method tackles HBPE when manually annotated ground truth labels\nare temporally sparse. We posit that the current state of the art approach\noversimplifies the temporal sparsity assumption by using Laplacian smoothing.\nOur final solution uses: i) Gaussian process regression in place of Laplacian\nsmoothing, ii) head and body coupling, and iii) nuclear norm minimization in\nthe matrix completion setting.

The corresponding ionospheric convection has\nrevealed that footprints in one hemisphere tend to move faster to reduce the\ndisplacement, a process we refer to as the restoring of symmetry. Although the\ninfluence on the return flow convection from the process of restoring symmetry\nhas been shown to be strongly controlled by the IMF, the influence from\ninternal magnetospheric processes has been less investigated. We use 14 years\nof line-of-sight measurements of the ionospheric plasma convection from the\nSuper Dual Auroral Radar Network to produce high-latitude convection maps\nsorted by season, IMF, and geomagnetic activity.

To ensure the numerical stability of the\nsubsequent FE discretizations, we apply the philosophy of the discontinuous\nPetrov-Galerkin (DPG) method by Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, by invoking test\nfunctions that lead to unconditionally stable numerical systems (if the kernel\nof the underlying differential operator is trivial).

This scheme completely\naddresses the crucial problem facing secure precise wireless transmission\n(SPWT), how to achieve the SPWT per OFDM symbol while the traditional SPWT\nholds only in statistically average sense. Several necessary conditions for\nSPWT per OFDM is derived and proposed: randomly distributed, sparse, and\ndistinct subcarrier distance between two pair of adjacent antennas. Two random\nsubcarrier sets (RSSs), quadratic subcarrier set (QSS) and prime subcarrier set\n(PSS), are constructed, where the former means the subcarrier index associated\nwith any antennas is the square of antenna index, and the latter implies that\nthe subcarrier indices over all antennas are prime numbers. Subsequently,\nfollowing those conditions for SPWT per OFDM, a random factor is defined, and a\nrandomization procedure (RP) is proposed. Its detailed process includes the\nfollowing steps: integer mod, ordering, blocking, and block interleaving where\nBI is repeated until the random factor is greater than the predefined\nthreshold. This yields a single main receive energy peak (SMREP) at the desired\nposition with other positions, outside the SMREP, harvesting only weak receive\nenergy seriously corrupted by AN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 13:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

In this paper we propose a residual memory neural network\n(RMN) architecture to model short-time dependencies using deep feed-forward\nlayers having residual and time delayed connections. The residual connection\npaves way to construct deeper networks by enabling unhindered flow of gradients\nand the time delay units capture temporal information with shared weights.

The computational complexity in training RMN is significantly\nless when compared to deep recurrent networks.

Recently, we reported the doping of Bi2Te3\nthin films with rare earth ions, which, owing to their large magnetic moments,\npromise commensurately large magnetic gap openings in the topological surface\nstates. However, only when doping with Dy has a sizable gap been observed in\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which persists up to\nroom-temperature. Although disorder alone could be ruled out as a cause of the\ntopological phase transition, a fundamental understanding of the magnetic and\nelectronic properties of Dy:Bi2Te3 remained elusive.

We find that the films are not simply paramagnetic but\nthat instead the observed behavior can be well explained by the assumption of\nslowly fluctuating, inhomogeneous magnetic patches with increasing volume\nfraction as the temperature decreases. At liquid helium temperatures, a large\neffective magnetization can be easily introduced by the application of moderate\nmagnetic fields, implying that this material is very suitable for proximity\ncoupling to an underlying ferromagnetic insulator or in a heterostructure with\ntransition metal-doped layers. However, the introduction of some charge\ncarriers by the dopants cannot be excluded at least in these highly doped\nsamples.

We are concerned with the effects of the\nnon-minimal coupling term on the growth of matter overdensities. Under the\nquasi-static approximation, we derive the equation which governs the evolution\nof matter density perturbations, and it is shown that the effective\ngravitational coupling 'constant' acquires an additional contribution due to\nthe non-minimal matter-torsion coupling term. In this way, this result\ngeneralizes those previously obtained for the growth of matter overdensities in\nthe case of minimal $f(T)$ gravity. In order to get a feeling of our results we\napply them to the important case of a power-law coupling function, which we\nassume to be the responsible for the late-time accelerated expansion in the\ndark energy regime. Thereby, analytic solutions for the matter density\nperturbation equation in the regime of dark matter dominance and the dark\nenergy epoch are obtained, along with a complete numerical integration of this\nequation. In particular, we show that this model predicts a growth index larger\nthan those obtained for $\\Lambda$CDM model, indicating therefore a smaller\ngrowth rate. Concomitantly, we show that the model at hand is potentially\ncapable in alleviating the existing $\\sigma_{8}$-tension, being that it can\nprovide us a $f\\sigma_{8}$ prediction which is $\\sim 4-5$ per cent below the\nrespective prediction of concordance model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 14:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 23:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Phase retrieval attempts to recover the phase information of a\nsignal from the magnitude of its Fourier transform to enable the reconstruction\nof the original signal. Solving the phase retrieval problem is equivalent to\nrecovering a signal from its auto-correlation function. In this paper, we\nassume the original signal to be sparse; this is a natural assumption in many\napplications, such as X-ray crystallography, speckle imaging and blind channel\nestimation. We propose an algorithm that resolves the phase retrieval problem\nin three stages: i) we leverage the finite rate of innovation sampling theory\nto super-resolve the auto-correlation function from a limited number of\nsamples, ii) we design a greedy algorithm that identifies the locations of a\nsparse solution given the super-resolved auto-correlation function, iii) we\nrecover the amplitudes of the atoms given their locations and the measured\nauto-correlation function. Unlike traditional approaches that recover a\ndiscrete approximation of the underlying signal, our algorithm estimates the\nsignal on a continuous domain, which makes it the first of its kind.\n  Along with the algorithm, we derive its performance bound with a theoretical\nanalysis and propose a set of enhancements to improve its computational\ncomplexity and noise resilience. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of the\nproposed method via a comparison against Charge Flipping, a notable algorithm\nin crystallography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 15:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

To improve safety outcomes, different approaches have been\nimplemented for health and safety training in the construction sector, such as\ntraditional tools and computer-aided technologies (e.g., serious games and\nvirtual reality). However, the effectiveness of these approaches has been\nbarely explored. In order to bridge this gap, a systematic review of existing\nstudies was conducted. Unlike previous review studies in this field that\nfocused on uncovering the technology characters and challenges, this study\nmainly evaluated the effectiveness of training using traditional tools and\ncomputer-aided technologies on the well-being of individuals. Measures of the\neffectiveness included knowledge acquisition, unsafe behaviour alteration, and\ninjury rate reduction. Results indicated that: 1. the effectiveness of\ntraditional tools is sufficiently supported by statistical evidence; and 2. the\nuse of computer-aided technologies has evidence to support its effectiveness,\nbut more solid evidence is required to support this statement. It was also\nfound that the overall performance of computer-aided technologies is superior\nin several technical aspects compared to traditional tools, namely,\nrepresenting actual workplace situations, providing text-free interfaces,\nhaving better user engagement, and being more cost-efficient. Finally, using\nthe systematic review findings, a theoretical framework is proposed as a\npotential solution to help future research in this field systematically examine\nthe effectiveness and usability of their approaches. This framework is\ntheoretical in nature and requires further validation. A further study is\ntherefore proposed to test and validate this framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 01:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The extracted parameters of these particles are studied as a function\nof charged particle multiplicity density ($dN_{ch}/d\\eta$).

All the identified hadrons show a mass ordering in\ntemperature, non-extensive parameter and also a strong dependence on\nmultiplicity classes, except the lighter particles. It is observed that as the\nparticle multiplicity increases, the $q$-parameter approaches to\nBoltzmann-Gibbs value, hence a conclusion can be drawn that system tends to\nthermal equilibrium.

In contrast, silicon nitride based material system\nusually suppress the TPA, but simultaneously leads to the reduction of the Kerr\nnonlinearity by two orders of magnitude. Here, we introduce a graphene/Si\nhybrid waveguide, which remain the optical properties and CMOS compatibility of\nSi waveguides, while enhance the Kerr nonlinearity by transferring patterned\ngraphene over the top of the waveguides. The graphene/Si waveguides are\nmeasured with a nonlinear parameter of 510 W-1m-1. Enhanced nonlinear\nfigure-of-merit (FOM) of 2.48 has been achieved, which is three times higher\nthan that of the Si waveguide. This work reveals the potential application of\ngraphene/Si hybrid photonic waveguides with high Kerr nonlinearity and FOM for\nnonlinear all-optical signal processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 04:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Youngs modulus is an indirect measure of texture. During thermal\ntreatment of hygroscopic foods, parameters such as moisture content\nsignificantly affect Youngs modulus. However, the sensitivity to these\nparameters has not yet been quantified in terms of the stress strain behaviour.\nWe have built an experimentally validated model to address this gap. This paper\npresents the stress strain behaviour and its sensitivity towards various\nparameters. Experiments are conducted with potato samples for stress strain\nbehaviour, parametric sensitivity analysis, estimation of initial and critical\nvalues of moisture content and Youngs modulus. We found that the Youngs modulus\nand the ultimate strength vary by as much as 54 percent and 29 percent\ndepending on the rate of applied strain, indicating the need for test\nstandards. Further, we propose a model to predict the local Youngs moduli as a\nfunction of moisture content, and a relationship between these and the\neffective Youngs modulus. While model results agree well for drying, they\ndeviate by as much as 16 percent from experiments for frying, indicating the\nnecessity of incorporating additional physics. We expect this work to serve as\na crucial step towards the physics based prediction modelling of local and\neffective Youngs moduli during thermal processing of food products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 11:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}
