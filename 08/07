In\nthis paper, we consider a wireless powered MEC network that adopts a binary\noffloading policy, so that each computation task of wireless devices (WDs) is\neither executed locally or fully offloaded to an MEC server. Our goal is to\nacquire an online algorithm that optimally adapts task offloading decisions and\nwireless resource allocations to the time-varying wireless channel conditions.\nThis requires quickly solving hard combinatorial optimization problems within\nthe channel coherence time, which is hardly achievable with conventional\nnumerical optimization methods. To tackle this problem, we propose a Deep\nReinforcement learning-based Online Offloading (DROO) framework that implements\na deep neural network as a scalable solution that learns the binary offloading\ndecisions from the experience. It eliminates the need of solving combinatorial\noptimization problems, and thus greatly reduces the computational complexity\nespecially in large-size networks. To further reduce the complexity, we propose\nan adaptive procedure that automatically adjusts the parameters of the DROO\nalgorithm on the fly. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can\nachieve near-optimal performance while significantly decreasing the computation\ntime by more than an order of magnitude compared with existing optimization\nmethods. For example, the CPU execution latency of DROO is less than $0.1$\nsecond in a $30$-user network, making real-time and optimal offloading truly\nviable even in a fast fading environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 16:13:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 15:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 02:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 03:11:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 01:48:49 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

We define effect\nquantales, derive useful properties, and show how they cleanly model a variety\nof known sequential effect systems.\n  We show that for most effect quantales, there is an induced notion of\niterating a sequential effect; that for systems we consider the derived\niteration agrees with the manually designed iteration operators in prior work;\nand that this induced notion of iteration is as precise as possible when\ndefined. We also position effect quantales with respect to work on categorical\nsemantics for sequential effect systems, clarifying the distinctions between\nthese systems and our own in the course of giving a thorough survey of these\nframeworks. Our derived iteration construct should generalize to these semantic\nstructures, addressing limitations of that work. Finally, we consider the\nrelationship between sequential effects and Kleene Algebras, where the latter\nmay be used as instances of the former.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 17:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 16:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 16:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 19:13:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 18:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 15:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Failing to detect missing information often leads to abrupt movements\nor to collisions with the environment. Active learning can quantify the\nuncertainty of performing the task and, in general, locate regions of missing\ninformation. We introduce a novel algorithm for active learning and demonstrate\nits utility for generating smooth trajectories. Our approach is based on deep\ngenerative models and metric learning in latent spaces.

When non-smooth transitions are detected, our algorithm asks for an\nadditional demonstration from that specific region.

For large mutual inclinations, the Lidov-Kozai mechanism secularly\nexcites large eccentricity and inclination oscillations of the inner binary.\nThe maximal eccentricity attained, $e_{\\rm max}$ is simply derived and widely\nused. However, for mildly hierarchical systems (i.e. the companion is\nrelatively close and massive), non-secular perturbations affect the evolution.\nHere we account for fast non-secular variations and find new analytic formula\nfor $e_{{\\rm max}}$, in terms of the system's hierarchy level, correcting\nprevious work and reproducing the orbital flip criteria. We find that $e_{{\\rm\nmax}}$ is generally enhanced, allowing closer encounters between the inner\nbinary components, thus significantly changing their interaction and its final\noutcome.

We treat the galactic disk as a\ngravitationally coupled, three-component system consisting of stars, atomic\nhydrogen gas, and molecular hydrogen gas in the gravitational field of the dark\nmatter halo. The self-consistent vertical distribution for stars and gas in\nsuch a realistic system is obtained for radii between 4-22 kpc. The inclusion\nof an additional gravitating component constrains the vertical stellar\ndistribution toward the mid-plane, so that the mid-plane density is higher, the\ndisk thickness is reduced, and the vertical density profile is steeper than in\nthe one-component, isothermal, stars-alone case. We show that the stellar\ndistribution is constrained mainly by the gravitational field of gas and dark\nmatter halo in the inner and the outer Galaxy, respectively. We find that the\nthickness of the stellar disk (measured as the HWHM of the vertical density\ndistribution) increases with radius, flaring steeply beyond R=17 kpc. The disk\nthickness is reduced by a factor of 3-4 in the outer Galaxy as a result of the\ngravitational field of the halo, which may help the disk resist distortion at\nlarge radii. The disk would flare even more if the effect of dark matter halo\nwere not taken into account.

The setup makes use of the spin\ncontrol available in atomic systems to generate spin transport induced by an\nimpurity atom immersed in a spin-imbalanced two-component Fermi gas. In\ncontrast to solid-state realizations, in ultracold atoms spin relaxation and\nthe decoherence from external sources is largely suppressed. As a consequence,\nonce the spin current is turned off by manipulating the internal spin degrees\nof freedom of the Fermi system, the nonequilibrium spin population remains\nconstant. Thus one can directly count the number of spins in each reservoir to\ninvestigate the full counting statistics of spin flips, which is notoriously\nchallenging in solid state devices. Moreover, using Ramsey interferometry, the\ndynamical impurity response can be measured. Since the impurity interacts with\na many-body environment that is out of equilibrium, our setup provides a way to\nrealize the non-equilibrium orthogonality catastrophe.

We present a\ndesign engine, the Data Calculator, which enables interactive and\nsemi-automated design of data structures. It brings two innovations. First, it\noffers a set of fine-grained design primitives that capture the first\nprinciples of data layout design: how data structure nodes lay data out, and\nhow they are positioned relative to each other. This allows for a structured\ndescription of the universe of possible data structure designs that can be\nsynthesized as combinations of those primitives. The second innovation is\ncomputation of performance using learned cost models. These models are trained\non diverse hardware and data profiles and capture the cost properties of\nfundamental data access primitives (e.g., random access). With these models, we\nsynthesize the performance cost of complex operations on arbitrary data\nstructure designs without having to: 1) implement the data structure, 2) run\nthe workload, or even 3) access the target hardware. We demonstrate that the\nData Calculator can assist data structure designers and researchers by\naccurately answering rich what-if design questions on the order of a few\nseconds or minutes, i.e., computing how the performance (response time) of a\ngiven data structure design is impacted by variations in the: 1) design, 2)\nhardware, 3) data, and 4) query workloads.

Arbitrary boundary choices\nenter the calculation of charges via Noether's second theorem, obstructing the\nassignment of unambiguous physical charges to local gauge symmetries. Replacing\nthe arbitrary boundary choice with new degrees of freedom suggests itself. But,\nconcretely, such boundary degrees of freedom are spurious---i.e. they are not\npart of the original field content of the theory---and have to disappear upon\ngluing. How should we fit them into what we know about field-theory? We resolve\nthese issues in a unified and geometric manner, by introducing a connection\n1-form, $\\varpi$, in the field-space of Yang-Mills theory. Using this geometric\ntool, a modified version of symplectic geometry---here called `horizontal'---is\npossible. Independently of boundary conditions, this formalism bestows to each\nregion a physical notion of charge: the horizontal Noether charge. The\nhorizontal gauge charges always vanish, while global charges still arise for\nreducible configurations characterized by global symmetries. The field-content\nitself is used as a reference frame to distinguish `gauge' and `physical'; no\nnew degrees of freedom, such as group-valued edge modes, are required.\nDifferent choices of reference fields give different $\\varpi$'s, which are\ncousins of gauge-fixing like the Higgs-unitary and Coulomb gauges. But the\nformalism extends well beyond gauge-fixings, for instance by avoiding the\nGribov problem. For one choice of $\\varpi$, would-be Goldstone modes arising\nfrom the condensation of matter degrees of freedom play precisely the role of\nthe known group-valued edge modes, but here they arise as preferred coordinates\nin field space, rather than new fields. For another choice, in the Abelian\ncase, $\\varpi$ recovers the Dirac dressing of the electron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 19:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 18:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 23:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

When discretized, the lifted model yields a polynomial system\nof either ordinary differential equations or differential algebraic equations,\ndepending on the problem and lifting transformation.

Here, a new principle, the\nOptimality Principle, is introduced, which allows one to predict, rapidly and\nintuitively, the form of optimal current patterns on any surface surrounding\nany arbitrary body.\n  Theory: The Optimality Principle, in its simplest form, states that the\nsurface current pattern associated with optimal transmit field or receive\nsensitivity at a point of interest (per unit current integrated over the\nsurface) is a precise scaled replica of the tangential electric field pattern\nthat would be generated on the surface by a precessing spin placed at that\npoint. A more general perturbative formulation enables efficient calculation of\nthe pattern modifications required to optimize signal-to-noise ratio in\nbody-noise-dominated situations.\n  Methods and Results: The unperturbed principle is validated numerically, and\nconvergence of the perturbative formulation is explored in simple geometries.\nCurrent patterns and corresponding field patterns in a variety of concrete\ncases are then used to separate signal and noise effects in coil optimization,\nto understand the emergence of electric dipoles as strong performers at high\nfrequency, and to highlight the importance of surface geometry in coil design.\n  Conclusion: Like the Principle of Reciprocity from which it is derived, the\nOptimality Principle offers both a conceptual and a computational shortcut. In\naddition to providing quantitative targets for coil design, the Optimality\nPrinciple affords direct physical insight into the fundamental determinants of\ncoil performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 19:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The proposed statistical\nmodel comprises the sum of a deterministic regression-function model and a\nstochastic noise model. The method constructs the regression-function model by\napplying regression techniques from machine learning (e.g., support vector\nregression, artificial neural networks) to map features (i.e., error indicators\nsuch as sampled elements of the residual) to a prediction of the\napproximate-solution error. The method constructs the noise model as a\nmean-zero Gaussian random variable whose variance is computed as the sample\nvariance of the approximate-solution error on a test set; this variance can be\ninterpreted as the epistemic uncertainty introduced by the approximate\nsolution. This work considers a wide range of feature-engineering methods,\ndata-set-construction techniques, and regression techniques that aim to ensure\nthat (1) the features are cheaply computable, (2) the noise model exhibits low\nvariance (i.e., low epistemic uncertainty introduced), and (3) the regression\nmodel generalizes to independent test data. Numerical experiments performed on\nseveral computational-mechanics problems and types of approximate solutions\ndemonstrate the ability of the method to generate statistical models of the\nerror that satisfy these criteria and significantly outperform more commonly\nadopted approaches for error modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 20:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 19:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

This choice has two key consequences: (1)\nsize-change termination can be checked at run-time and (2) termination can be\nrephrased as a safety property analyzed using existing methods for systematic\nabstraction.\n  We formulate run-time size-change checks as contracts in the style of Findler\nand Felleisen.

To do so, the solid electrolyte must be able to suppress\nmorphological instabilities that lead to poor coulombic efficiency and, in the\nworst case, internal short circuits. In this work, lithium electrodeposition\nexperiments were performed using single-crystal Li6La3ZrTaO12 garnet as solid\nelectrolyte layers to investigate the factors that determine whether lithium\npenetration occurs through brittle inorganic solid electrolytes. In these\nsingle crystals, grain boundaries are excluded as possible paths for lithium\nmetal propagation. However, Vickers microindentation was used to introduce\nsharp surface flaws of known size. Using operando optical microscopy, it was\nfound that lithium metal penetration sometimes initiates at these controlled\nsurface defects, and when multiple indents of varying size were present,\npropagates preferentially from the largest defect. However, a second class of\nflaws was found to be equally or more important. At the perimeter of surface\ncurrent collectors, an enhanced electrodeposition current density causes\nlithium metal filled cracks to initiate and grow to penetration, even when the\nlarge Vickers defects are in close proximity. Modeling the electric field\nconcentration for the experimental configurations, it was shown that a factor\nof 5 enhancement in field can readily occur within 10 micrometers of current\ncollector discontinuities, which we interpret as the origin of\nelectrochemomechanical stresses leading to failure. Such field amplification\nmay determine the sites where supercritical surface defects dominate lithium\nmetal propagation during electrodeposition, overriding the presence of larger\ndefects elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 20:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

The identification of low-dimensional compounds is therefore\nof key interest. Here, we perform a geometric analysis of material structures,\ndemonstrating a strong clustering of materials depending on their\ndimensionalities. Based on the geometric analysis, we propose a simple scoring\nparameter to identify materials of a particular dimension or of mixed\ndimensionality.

In the case of 2D materials the\nscoring parameter is seen to clearly separate 2D from non-2D materials and the\nparameter correlates well with the bonding strength in the layered materials.\nAbout 3000 materials are identified as one-dimensional, while more than 9000\nare mixed-dimensionality materials containing a molecular (0D) component.

However, most studies\nto characterize social influence, and, in general, most data-science analyses\nfocus on correlations, statistical independence, or conditional independence.\nOnly recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in \"causal data\nscience\", e.g., grounded on causality theories. In this paper we adopt a\nprincipled causal approach to the analysis of social influence from\ninformation-propagation data, rooted in the theory of probabilistic causation.\n  Our approach consists of two phases. In the first one, in order to avoid the\npitfalls of misinterpreting causation when the data spans a mixture of several\nsubtypes (\"Simpson's paradox\"), we partition the set of propagation traces into\ngroups, in such a way that each group is as less contradictory as possible in\nterms of the hierarchical structure of information propagation. To achieve this\ngoal, we borrow the notion of \"agony\" and define the Agony-bounded Partitioning\nproblem, which we prove being hard, and for which we develop two efficient\nalgorithms with approximation guarantees. In the second phase, for each group\nfrom the first phase, we apply a constrained MLE approach to ultimately learn a\nminimal causal topology.

The inner\nslope of the DM density for the CLASH clusters is found to be flatter than the\nNavarro--Frenk--White profile, ranging from $\\alpha=0.30$ to $0.79$. We examine\ncorrelations of the DM density slope $\\alpha$ with the effective radius\n$R_\\mathrm{e}$ and stellar mass $M_\\mathrm{e}$ of the BCG, finding that these\nquantities are anti-correlated with a Spearman correlation coefficient of $\\sim\n-0.6$. We also study the correlation between $R_\\mathrm{e}$ and the cluster\nhalo mass $M_{500}$, and the correlation between the total masses inside 5\\,kpc\nand 100\\,kpc. We find that these quantities are correlated with Spearman\ncoefficients of $0.68$ and $0.64$, respectively. These observed correlations\nare in support of the physical picture proposed by Newman et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 22:25:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 15:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

The\nwind-wind collision scenario suggests that the secondary's wind penetrates the\nprimary's wind creating a low-density cavity in it, with dense walls where the\ntwo winds interact. We aim to trace the inner ~5-50 au structure of Eta Car's\nwind-wind interaction, as seen through BrG and, for the first time, through the\nHe I 2s-2p line.

The classical region of the Kuiper Belt has two\npopulations (the cold and hot populations) with completely different physical\nand dynamical properties. These properties have been explained in the framework\nof a subset of the simulations of the Nice Model, in which Neptune remained on\na low-eccentricity orbit (Neptune's eccentricity is never larger than 0.1)\nthroughout the giant planet instability. However, recent simulations have\nshowed that the remaining Nice model simulations, in which Neptune temporarily\nacquires a large-eccentricity orbit (larger than 0.1), are also consistent with\nthe preservation of the cold population (inclination smaller than 4 degrees),\nif the latter formed in situ. However, the resulting a cold population showed\nin many of the simulations eccentricities larger than those observed for the\nreal population. We focus on a short period of time which is characterized by\nNeptune's large eccentricity and a slow precession of Neptune's perihelion. We\nshow that if self-gravity is considered in the disk, the precession rate of the\nparticles longitude of perihelion is slowed down. This, combined with the\neffect of mutual scattering among the bodies, which spreads all orbital\nelements, allows some objects to return to low eccentricities. However, we show\nthat if the cold population originally had a small total mass, this effect is\nnegligible. Thus, we conclude that the only possibilities to keep at low\neccentricity some cold-population objects during a high-eccentricity phase of\nNeptune are that (i) either Neptune's precession was rapid, as suggested by\nBatygin et al. (2011) or (ii) Neptune's slow precession phase was long enough\nto allow some particles to experience a full secular cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 22:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

While the irregular\nshapes of large asteroids may be attributed to collisional events, those of\nsmall asteroids may result from not only impact events but also rotationally\ninduced failure, a long-term consequence of small torques caused by, for\nexample, solar radiation pressure. A better understanding of shape deformation\ninduced by such small torques will allow us to give constraints on the\nevolution process of an asteroid and its structure. However, no quantitative\nstudy has been reported to provide the relationship between an asteroid's shape\nand its failure mode due to its fast rotation. Here, we use a finite element\nmodel (FEM) technique to analyze the failure modes and conditions of 24\nasteroids with diameters less than 30 - 40 km, which were observed at high\nresolution by ground radar or asteroid exploration missions. Assuming that the\nmaterial distribution is uniform, we investigate how these asteroids fail\nstructurally at different spin rates. Our FEM simulations describe the detailed\ndeformation mode of each irregularly shaped asteroid at fast spin. The failed\nregions depend on the original shape. Spheroidal objects structurally fail from\nthe interior, while elongated objects experience structural failure on planes\nperpendicular to the minimum moment of inertia axes in the middle of their\nstructure. Contact binary objects have structural failure across their most\nsensitive cross sections. We further investigate if our FEM analysis is\nconsistent with earlier works that theoretically explored a uniformly rotating\ntriaxial ellipsoid. The results show that global shape variations may\nsignificantly change the failure condition of an asteroid. Our work suggests\nthat it is critical to take into account the actual shapes of asteroids to\nexplore their failure modes in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 00:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Specifically, we introduce a Holistic Scene Grammar\n(HSG) to represent the 3D scene structure, which characterizes a joint\ndistribution over the functional and geometric space of indoor scenes. The\nproposed HSG captures three essential and often latent dimensions of the indoor\nscenes: i) latent human context, describing the affordance and the\nfunctionality of a room arrangement, ii) geometric constraints over the scene\nconfigurations, and iii) physical constraints that guarantee physically\nplausible parsing and reconstruction. We solve this joint parsing and\nreconstruction problem in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion, seeking to minimize\nthe differences between the input image and the rendered images generated by\nour 3D representation, over the space of depth, surface normal, and object\nsegmentation map. The optimal configuration, represented by a parse graph, is\ninferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which efficiently traverses\nthrough the non-differentiable solution space, jointly optimizing object\nlocalization, 3D layout, and hidden human context. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the generalization ability and\nsignificantly outperforms prior methods on 3D layout estimation, 3D object\ndetection, and holistic scene understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 03:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

We study how this constraint influences the quality of\nservices with particular focus on stability. We show that in the regime of\ndeterministic algorithms, the significance of energy restriction depends\nstrongly on communication capabilities of broadcasting protocols.

Inferred gas masses from\nCO in recent ALMA observations of large samples of disks seem inconsistent with\ntheir inferred dust masses. The derived gas-to-dust mass ratios from CO are 1-2\norders of magnitude lower than $\\sim$100 even if photodissociation and\nfreeze-out are included. Herschel measurements of HD line emission imply gas\nmasses in line with gas-to-dust mass ratios of 100. This suggests that at least\none additional mechanism is removing gaseous CO. Here we test the suggestion\nthat the bulk of the CO is chemically processed and that the carbon is\nsequestered into less volatile species such as CO2, CH3OH and CH4 in the dense,\nshielded midplane regions of the disk. Using our gas-grain chemical code we\nperform a parameter exploration and follow the CO abundance evolution over a\nrange of conditions representative of shielded disk midplanes. We find that no\nchemical processing of CO takes place on 1-3 Myr timescales for low cosmic-ray\nionisation rates, $< 5\\times 10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$. Assuming an ionisation rate of\n$10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, more than 90% of the CO is destroyed, but only in the\nparts of the disk below 30 K. This order of magnitude destruction of CO is\nrobust against the choice of grain-surface reaction rate parameters except for\ntemperatures below 20 K, where there is a strong dependence on the H tunnelling\nbarrier. The low temperatures needed for CO chemical processing indicate that\nthe exact disk temperature structure is important, with warm disks around\nluminous Herbig stars expected to have little to no CO conversion. For cold\ndisks around T Tauri stars, a large fraction of the emitting CO layer is\naffected unless the disks are young (< 1 Myr).

Our hypothesis is that\nthese deceptive observed light curves are interference of two real constant\nperiod light curves of long-lived starspots. The slow motion of these\nlong-lived starspots with respect to each other causes the observed light curve\nchanges. This hypothesis contradicts the current views of starspots. Therefore,\nwe subject it to eight reproducible tests. Our new period finding method\ndetects the two real light curves of FK Com. Our hypothesis is a total success:\nall real light curve parameters are directly connected to the long-lived\nstarspots which are also seen in the Doppler images of FK Com.These parameters\nare spatially and temporally correlated just like in the Sun, including weak\nsolar-like surface differential rotation.

This\ninteraction, coupled with orbital motion, is expected to make the jet follow a\nhelical, nonballistic trajectory. The jet energy dissipated by this\ninteraction, through shocks for example, could lead to nonthermal activity on\nscales significantly larger than the system size. We calculate the broadband\nemission from a jet affected by the impact of the stellar wind and orbital\nmotion in a high-mass microquasar. We employ a prescription for the helical\ntrajectory of a jet in a system with a circular orbit. Subsequently, assuming\nelectron acceleration at the onset of the helical jet region, we compute the\nspatial and energy distribution of these electrons, and their synchrotron and\ninverse Compton emission including gamma-ray absorption effects. For typical\nsource parameters, significant radio, X- and gamma-ray luminosities are\npredicted. The scales on which the emission is produced may reduce, but not\nerase, orbital variability of the inverse Compton emission. The wind and\norbital effects on the radio emission morphology could be studied using very\nlong baseline interferometric techniques. We predict significant broadband\nemission, modulated by orbital motion, from a helical jet in a high-mass\nmicroquasar. This emission may be hard to disentangle from radiation of the\nbinary itself, although the light curve features, extended radio emission, and\na moderate opacity to very high-energy gamma rays, could help to identify the\ncontribution from an extended (helical) jet region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 08:53:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 08:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 09:48:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 08:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

A new class of wavefront\nsensors, the Generalised Optical Differentiation Wavefront Sensors, has been\ndevised, in a way not to undergo this linear trade off and to decouple the\ndynamic range from the sensitivity. This new class of WFSs is based on the\nlight filtering in the focal plane from a dedicated amplitude filter, which is\na hybrid between a linear filter, whose physical dimension is related to the\ndynamic range, and a step in the amplitude, whose size is related to the\nsensitivity. We propose here a possible technical implementation of this kind\nof WFS, making use of a simple holographic diffuser to diffract part of the\nlight in a ring shape around the pin of a pyramid wavefront sensor. In this\nway, the undiffracted light reaches the pin of the pyramid, contributing to the\nhigh sensitivity regime of the WFS, while the diffused light is giving a sort\nof static modulation of the pyramid, allowing to have some signal even in high\nturbulence conditions. The holographic diffuser zeroth order efficiency is\nstrictly related to the sensitivity of the WFS, while the diffusing angle of\nthe diffracted light gives the amount of modulation and thus the dynamic range.\nBy properly choosing these two parameters it is possible to build a WFS with\nhigh sensitivity and high dynamic range in a static fashion. Introducing\ndynamic parts in the setup allows to have a set of different diffuser that can\nbe alternated in front of the pyramid, if the change in the seeing conditions\nrequires it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 08:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

This event was observed in H-alpha with GONG and CLIMSO, and in\nultraviolet (UV) with the AIA/SDO imager. The aim of the paper is to relate the\nphotospheric motions below the filament and its environment to the eruption of\nthe filament. An analysis of the photospheric motions using SDO/HMI continuum\nimages with the coherent structure tracking (CST) algorithm developed to track\ngranules, as well as large-scale photospheric flows, has been performed. The\nsupergranule pattern is clearly visible outside the filament channel but\ndifficult to detect inside because the modulus of the vector velocity is\nreduced in the filament channel, mainly in the magnetized areas. The horizontal\nphotospheric flows are strong on the west side of the filament channel and\noriented towards the filament. The ends of the filament sections are found in\nareas of concentration of corks. Whirled flows are found locally around the\nfeet. The strong horizontal flows with an opposite direction to the\ndifferential rotation create strong shear and convergence along the magnetic\npolarity inversion line (PIL) in the filament channel. The filament has been\ndestabilized by the converging flows, which initiate an ascent of the middle\nsection of the filament until the filament reaches the critical height of the\ntorus instability inducing, consequently, the eruption. The \"n\" decay index\nindicated an altitude of 60 Mm for the critical height.

For\nCeCu$_2$Si$_2$, fully-gapped d-wave superconductivity forms in the vicinity of\nan itinerant three-dimensional heavy-fermion spin-density-wave (SDW) quantum\ncritical point (QCP). Inelastic neutron scattering results highlight that both\nquantum critical SDW fluctuations as well as Mott-type fluctuations of local\nmagnetic moments contribute to the formation of Cooper pairs in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$.\nIn YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, superconductivity appears to be suppressed at $T\\gtrsim~10$\nmK by AF order ($T_N$ = 70 mK). Ultra-low temperature measurements reveal a\nhybrid order between nuclear and 4f-electronic spins, which is dominated by the\nYb-derived nuclear spins, to develop at $T_A$ slightly above 2 mK. The hybrid\norder turns out to strongly compete with the primary 4f-electronic order and to\npush the material towards its QCP. Apparently, this paves the way for\nheavy-fermion superconductivity to form at $T_c$ = 2 mK. Like the pressure -\ninduced QCP in CeRhIn$_5$, the magnetic field - induced one in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$\nis of the local Kondo-destroying variety which corresponds to a Mott-type\ntransition at zero temperature. Therefore, these materials form the link\nbetween the large family of about fifty low-$T$ unconventional heavy - fermion\nsuperconductors and other families of unconventional superconductors with\nhigher $T_c$s, notably the doped Mott insulators of the cuprates, organic\ncharge-transfer salts and some of the Fe-based superconductors.

If true,\nthe dark energy needs to be described by an evolving scalar field, i.e.,\nquintessence with $w>-1$ within supergravity. However, the large hierarchy\nbetween the supersymmetry breaking scale and the energy scale of dark energy\nimposes a challenge on building quintessence models in supergravity as the\nquintessence field typically acquires a mass of order the gravitino mass. We\ninvestigate two approaches to circumvent this obstacle.

A particular example can address the cosmic coincidence problem.\nThe other approach is sequestered supergravity, and the stability requirement\nstrongly constrains the form of the Kahler potential and superpotential, and\nthe quintessence field displacement is typically much smaller than Planck mass.\nIn addition, to satisfy the fifth force constraint, the quintessence field\ndisplacement is further restricted in the sequestered case, requiring $c \\ll\n1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 09:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Sketches are clearly related to photo edge-maps, but a human\nfree-hand sketch of a photo is not simply a clean rendering of that photo's\nedge map. Instead there is a fundamental process of abstraction and iconic\nrendering, where overall geometry is warped and salient details are selectively\nincluded. In this paper we study this sketching process and attempt to invert\nit. We model this inversion by translating iconic free-hand sketches to\ncontours that resemble more geometrically realistic projections of object\nboundaries, and separately factorise out the salient added details. This\nfactorised re-representation makes it easier to match a free-hand sketch to a\nphoto instance of an object. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised\nimage style transfer model based on enforcing a cyclic embedding consistency\nconstraint. A deep FG-SBIR model is then formulated to accommodate\ncomplementary discriminative detail from each factorised sketch for better\nmatching with the corresponding photo. Our method is evaluated both\nqualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate its superiority over a number\nof state-of-the-art alternatives for style transfer and FG-SBIR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 11:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

Recent observations of unexpected structures in the Galactic Cosmic\nRay (GCR) spectrum and composition, as well as growing evidence for episodes of\nintense dynamical activity in the inner regions of the Galaxy, call for an\nevaluation of the high-energy particle acceleration associated with such\nactivity and its potential impact on the global GCR phenomenology.\n  Aims. We investigate whether particles accelerated during high-power episodes\naround the Galactic center can account for a significant fraction of the\nobserved GCRs, or conversely what constraints can be derived regarding their\nGalactic transport if their contributions are negligible.\n  Methods. We address these questions by studying the contribution of a\ncontinuous source of energetic particles at the Galactic center to the local\nGCRs. Particle transport in the Galaxy is described with a two-zone analytical\nmodel. We solve for the contribution of a Galactic Center Cosmic-Ray (GCCR)\nsource using Green functions and Bessel expansion, and discuss the required\ninjection power for these GCCRs to influence the global GCR phenomenology at\nEarth.\n  Results. We find that, with standard parameters for particle propagation in\nthe galactic disk and halo, the GCCRs can make a significant or even dominant\ncontribution to the total CR flux observed at Earth. Depending on the\nparameters, such a source can account for both the observed proton flux and\nB-to-C ratio (in the case of a Kraichnan-like scaling of the diffusion\ncoefficient), or potentially produce spectral and composition features.\n  Conclusions. Our results show that the contribution of GCCRs cannot be\nneglected a priori, and that they can influence the global GCR phenomenology\nsignificantly, thereby calling for a reassessement of the standard inferences\nfrom a scenario where GCRs are entirely dominated by a single type of sources\ndistributed throughout the Galactic disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 12:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

A comparison of the early time data with a sample of\nSNe~Ia shows distinct features, differing from normal SNe~Ia at early phases\nbut similar to normal SNe~Ia at a few weeks after maximum light (i.e. the\ntransitional phase) and well into the nebular phase. The transparency\ntimescales ($t_0$) for this sample of SNe~Ia range between $\\sim$ 25 and 41\ndays indicating a diversity in the ejecta masses. $t_0$ also weakly correlates\nwith the peak bolometric luminosity, consistent with the interpretation that\nSNe with higher ejecta masses would produce more $^{56}$Ni. Comparing the $t_0$\nand the maximum luminosity, L$_{max}$\\, distribution of a sample of SNe~Ia to\npredictions from a wide range of explosion models we find an indication that\nthe sub-Chandrasekhar mass models span the range of observed values. However,\nthe bright end of the distribution can be better explained by Chandrasekhar\nmass delayed detonation models, hinting at multiple progenitor channels to\nexplain the observed bolometric properties of SNe~Ia. iPTF16abc appears to be\nconsistent with the predictions from the M$_{ch}$ models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 12:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

We determine the effect of stellar\nradiation and cosmic rays upon atmospheric composition, temperature, and\nspectral appearance. Despite strong stratospheric O$_3$ destruction by cosmic\nrays, smog O$_3$ can significantly build up in the lower atmosphere of our\nmodeled planet around AD Leo related to low stellar UVB. N$_2$O abundances\ndecrease with increasing flaring energies but a sink reaction for N$_2$O with\nexcited oxygen becomes weaker, stabilizing its abundance. CH$_4$ is removed\nmainly by Cl in the upper atmosphere for strong flaring cases and not via\nhydroxyl as is otherwise usually the case. Cosmic rays weaken the role of\nCH$_4$ in heating the middle atmosphere so that H$_2$O absorption becomes more\nimportant.

We find\nthe qualitative evolution of the normalised bispectrum during X-ray heating to\nbe generic, unless the sources of X-rays are, as with QSOs, less numerous and\nso exhibit more distinct isolated heated profiles. Assuming mitigation of\nforeground and instrumental effects are ultimately effective, we find that we\nshould be sensitive to the normalised bispectrum during the epoch of heating,\nso long as the spin temperature has not saturated by $z \\approx 19$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 13:59:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 11:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

To the best of the\nauthors' knowledge, for the first time, this article presents an efficient\nlearning architecture and design strategies including link level verification\nthrough digital circuit implementations using hardware description language\n(HDL) to mitigate this challenge and to deduce feasibility and potential of DNN\nfor communications systems. In particular, DNN is applied for an encoder and a\ndecoder to enable flexible adaptation with respect to the system environments\nwithout needing any domain specific information. Extensive investigations and\ninterdisciplinary design considerations including the DNN-based autoencoder\nstructure, learning framework, and low-complexity digital circuit\nimplementations for real-time operation are taken into account by the authors\nwhich ascertains the use of DNN-based communications in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 14:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-08"}

To investigate, a preterm infant study was\nconducted; infant fecal samples were collected during the infants' first month\nof postnatal age, resulting in functional compositional microbiome data, and\nneurobehavioral outcomes were measured when infants reached 36-38 weeks of\npost-menstrual age. To identify potential microbiome markers and estimate how\nthe trajectories of gut microbiome compositions during early postnatal stage\nimpact later neurobehavioral outcomes of the preterm infants, we innovate a\nsparse log-contrast regression with functional compositional predictors.

Its first chapter is devoted to the phase\ndiagram of isospin-asymmetrical nuclear matter in the density-temperature\nplane. Four competing phases of matter are included into the consideration: the\nunpaired phase, the ordinary Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase, a phase\nwhere normal fluid and superfluid separate into distinct domains and the\nsuperfluid phase with a non-zero total momentum of Cooper pairs. The evolution\nof these phases from the weakly BCS limit to the strongly coupled\nBose-Einstein-Condensate limit is studied by varying the density from high to\nlow values at various temperatures and asymmetries. The emergence of\ntri-critical points (including a Lifshitz point) and various intrinsic\nproperties of the condensate (pair wave-function, occupation numbers,\nquasiparticle spectra) are discussed.

Because of its uniqueness properties the CPD has\nfound many concrete applications in telecommunication, array processing,\nmachine learning, etc. On the other hand, in several applications the rank-1\nconstraint on the terms is too restrictive. A multilinear rank-$(M,N,L)$\nconstraint (where a rank-1 term is the special case for which $M=N=L=1$) could\nbe more realistic, while it still yields a decomposition with attractive\nuniqueness properties. In this paper we focus on the decomposition of a tensor\n$\\mathcal T$ into a sum of multilinear rank-$(1,L_r,L_r)$ terms, $r=1,...,R$.\nThis particular decomposition type has already found applications in wireless\ncommunication, chemometrics and the blind signal separation of signals that can\nbe modelled as exponential polynomials and rational functions. We find\nconditions on the terms which guarantee that the decomposition is unique and\ncan be computed by means of the eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix even in\nthe cases where none of the factor matrices has full column rank. We consider\nboth the case where the decomposition is exact and the case where the\ndecomposition holds only approximately. We show that in both cases the number\nof the terms $R$ and their \"sizes\" $L_1,...,L_R$ do not have to be known a\npriori and can be estimated as well. The conditions for uniqueness are easy to\nverify, especially for terms that can be considered \"generic\".

Our\nstudy allows us to construct for the first time a detailed temperature-pressure\nphase diagram of a material on the border of a ferroelectric quantum critical\npoint comprising ferroelectric, quantum critical paraelectric and hybridized\npolar-acoustic regimes. Furthermore, at the lowest temperatures, below the\nsusceptibility maximum, we observe a new regime characterized by a linear\ntemperature dependence of the inverse susceptibility that differs sharply from\nthe quartic temperature dependence predicted by the LKSR theory.

In this scenario, the universality of phonon scattering\ncomes about because the characteristic energy scale of the local anharmonic\nresonances and the strength of their interaction with phonons are both set by\nthe glass transition temperature $T_g$, while their concentration is set by the\ncooperativity size $\\xi$ for dynamics at $T_g$.

If strong\nfirst-order phase transitions do not exist within neutron stars, both neutron\nstars are described by the same equation of state, and their Lambdas are highly\ncorrelated through their masses even if the equation of state is unknown. If,\nhowever, a strong phase transition exists between the central densities of the\ntwo stars, so that the more massive star has a phase transition and the least\nmassive star does not, this correlation will be weakened. In all cases, a\nminimum Lambda for each neutron star mass is imposed by causality, and a less\nconservative limit is imposed by the unitary gas constraint, both of which we\ncompute. In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,\nit is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses\nas well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the\ncase without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass\nM_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star\nsystems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the\ndimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the\nbinary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively. Moreover, they are\nbounded by q^{n_-}>Lambda_1/Lambda_2> q^{n_{0+}+qn_{1+}}, where\nn_-<n_{0+}+qn_{1+}; the parameters depend only on M_chirp, which is accurately\ndetermined from the gravitational-wave signal. We also provide analytic\nexpressions for the wider bounds that exist in the case of a strong phase\ntransition. We argue that bounded ranges for Lambda_1/Lambda_2, tuned to\nM_chirp, together with lower bounds to Lambda(M), will be more useful in\ngravitational waveform modeling than other suggested approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 19:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

A tremendous opportunity rests\nwithin cross-modal data analysis that leverages existing domain knowledge\nmethods to understand and guide human health. Especially in chronic diseases,\ncurrent medical practice uses a combination of sparse hospital based biological\nmetrics (blood tests, expensive imaging, etc.) to understand the evolving\nhealth status of an individual. Future health systems must integrate data\ncreated at the individual level to better understand health status perpetually,\nespecially in a cybernetic framework. In this work we fuse multiple user\ncreated and open source data streams along with established biomedical domain\nknowledge to give two types of quantitative state estimates of cardiovascular\nhealth. First, we use wearable devices to calculate cardiorespiratory fitness\n(CRF), a known quantitative leading predictor of heart disease which is not\nroutinely collected in clinical settings.

The rapid growth of multi-modal wearables and sensors\nhave not made this jump effectively in the domain of health. Modern user\ncontent consumption and decision making in both cyber (e.g. entertainment,\nnews) and physical (eg. food, shopping) spaces rely heavily on targeted\npersonalized recommender systems. The utility function is the primary ranking\nmethod to predict what a given person would explicitly prefer.

The exogenous layer incorporates\nfactors outside of the person's body (eg. location, weather, social context),\nwhile the endogenous layer integrates data to estimate the physiologic or\ninnate needs of the user.
