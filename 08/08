Clump formation is seeded in simulations via\ncontrolled perturbations with a specified wavelength and velocity. These are\napplied to otherwise quiet gas disks ranging from analogues of present day\nspirals to gas-rich, high-redshift galaxies. The results are compared to linear\ntheory, turbulently perturbed disks and observations. The results reflect the\nexpectations of linear, non-axisymmetric theory with a finite window for growth\ninto a bound clump. We identify two new modes of clump formation:\nrotation-driven fission and fragmentation of tidal tails, though both are\nexpected to rarely contribute to clump formation in observed disks. We find\nthat bound clumps are generally much smaller than the so-called Toomre mass.\nThe preferred scale for fragmentation increases with the disk gas mass but\ncannot produce bound objects larger than $\\sim10^9$ M$_{\\odot}$. The most\nlikely bound clump mass increases from $3\\times10^6$ in low mass disks up to\n$5\\times10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$.

The commonly adopted static hypothesis\ntesting for physical layer authentication faces significant challenges in\ntime-varying communication channels due to the changing propagation and\ninterference conditions, which are typically unknown at the design stage. To\ncircumvent this impediment, we propose an adaptive physical layer\nauthentication scheme based on machine-learning as an intelligent process to\nlearn and utilize the complex and time-varying environment, and hence to\nimprove the reliability and robustness of physical layer authentication.\nExplicitly, a physical layer attribute fusion model based on a kernel machine\nis designed for dealing with multiple attributes without requiring the\nknowledge of their statistical properties. By modeling the physical layer\nauthentication as a linear system, the proposed technique directly reduces the\nauthentication scope from a combined N-dimensional feature space to a single\ndimensional (scalar) space, hence leading to reduced authentication complexity.\nBy formulating the learning (training) objective of the physical layer\nauthentication as a convex problem, an adaptive algorithm based on kernel\nleast-mean-square is then proposed as an intelligent process to learn and track\nthe variations of multiple attributes, and therefore to enhance the\nauthentication performance. Both the convergence and the authentication\nperformance of the proposed intelligent authentication process are\ntheoretically analyzed.

For instance, we find that the role of spin\nmagnitudes and spin directions in $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ can be largely disentangled,\nand that the symmetry of the effective-spin distribution is a robust indicator\nof the binary's formation history. Our predictions for individual spin\ndirections and their precessional morphologies confirm and extend early toy\nmodels, while exploring substantially more realistic and broader sets of\ninitial conditions. Our main conclusion is that specific subpopulations of BH\nbinaries will exhibit distinctive precessional dynamics: these classes include\n(but are not limited to) sources where stellar tidal interactions act on\nsufficiently short timescales, and massive binaries produced in pulsational\npair-instability supernovae. Measurements of BH spin orientations have enormous\npotential to constrain specific evolutionary processes in the lives of massive\nbinary stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 19:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

However, their\nperformance is limited by the low carrier mobility (especially electron\nmobility) due to the formation of small polarons. Recent experimental studies\nshow improved carrier mobility and conductivity by atomic dopings. We studied\nthe small polaron hopping mobility in pristine and doped \\ce{BiVO4} by\ncombining Landau-Zener theory and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation fully\nfrom first-principles, and investigated the effect of dopant-polaron\ninteractions on the mobility. We found polarons are spontaneously formed at V\nin both pristine and Mo/W doped \\ce{BiVO4}, which can only be described\ncorrectly by density function theory (DFT) with the Hubbard correction (DFT+U)\nor hybrid exchange-correlation functional but not local or semi-local\nfunctionals. We found DFT+U and dielectric dependant hybrid functional (DDH)\ngive similar electron hopping barriers, which are also similar between the room\ntemperature monoclinic phase and the tetragonal phase. The calculated electron\nmobility agrees well with experimental values, which is around $10^{-4}$\ncm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$.

Lower quality\nreduces the data's utility, but smaller size enables both reduced network and\nstorage costs at the servers and reduced power consumption in sensing devices.\nA natural solution is to compress the data at the sensing devices.\nUnfortunately, existing compression algorithms either violate the memory and\nlatency constraints common for these devices or, as we show experimentally,\nperform poorly on sensor-generated time series.\n  We introduce a time series compression algorithm that achieves\nstate-of-the-art compression ratios while requiring less than 1KB of memory and\nadding virtually no latency.

In order to meet the\ngrowing demand for high-quality products, the use of intelligent visual\ninspection systems is becoming essential in production lines. Recently,\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in both\nimage classification and localization tasks. In this article, a system is\nproposed for the identification of casting defects in X-ray images, based on\nthe Mask Region-based CNN architecture. The proposed defect detection system\nsimultaneously performs defect detection and segmentation on input images,\nmaking it suitable for a range of defect detection tasks.

A large enhancement of the [Zn/Fe] ratios of very metal-poor\nstars in the Galactic halo suggests the death of short-lived massive stars,\ni.e., core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), as one major site for Zn production.\nPrevious studies have claimed that some specific CCSNe can produce Zn in\nsufficient quantities.

Using a Zn abundance feature similar to that\nof r-process elements in faint satellite galaxies, we find evidence that Zn\nproduction took place through much rarer events than canonical CCSNe. This\nfinding can be unified with the implied decrease in the rate of Zn production\nwith an increasing metallicity for Galactic halo stars, which narrows down the\nmajor site of Zn production in the early galaxy to magneto-rotational SNe\n(MR-SNe).

Thus,\nwe first investigate necessary and sufficient conditions for the sketch\nsampling to have well-defined algorithms. Based on these sampling conditions we\ndeveloped new sketch descent methods for solving general smooth linearly\nconstrained problems, in particular, random sketch descent and accelerated\nrandom sketch descent methods. From our knowledge, this is the first\nconvergence analysis of random sketch descent algorithms for optimization\nproblems with multiple non-separable linear constraints. For the general case,\nwhen the objective function is smooth and non-convex, we prove for the\nnon-accelerated variant sublinear rate in expectation for an appropriate\noptimality measure. In the smooth convex case, we derive for both algorithms,\nnon-accelerated and accelerated random sketch descent, sublinear convergence\nrates in the expected values of the objective function. Additionally, if the\nobjective function satisfies a strong convexity type condition, both algorithms\nconverge linearly in expectation. In special cases, where complexity bounds are\nknown for some particular sketching algorithms, such as coordinate descent\nmethods for optimization problems with a single linear coupled constraint, our\ntheory recovers the best-known bounds. We also show that when random sketch is\nsketching the coordinate directions randomly produces better results than the\nfixed selection rule. Finally, we present some numerical examples to illustrate\nthe performances of our new algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 19:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

Asymptotic Giant Branch stars are characterised by complex stellar\nsurface dynamics that affect the measurements and amplify the uncertainties on\nstellar parameters. The resulting motion of the stellar photo-center could have\nadverse effects on the parallax determination with Gaia. Aims. We explore the\nimpact of the convection-related surface structure in AGBs on the photocentric\nvariability. We quantify these effects to characterise the observed parallax\nerrors and estimate fundamental stellar parameters and dynamical properties.\nMethods. We use 3D radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of convection with\nCO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative transfer code Optim3D to compute\nintensity maps in the Gaia G band. From those maps, we calculate the\nintensity-weighted mean of all emitting points tiling the visible stellar\nsurface and evaluate its motion as a function of time. We extract the parallax\nerror from Gaia DR2 for a sample of semiregular variables in the solar\nneighbourhood and compare it to the synthetic predictions of photo-center\ndisplacements. Results. AGB stars show a complex surface morphology\ncharacterised by the presence of few large scale long-lived convective cells\naccompanied by short-lived and small scale structures. As a consequence, the\nposition of the photo-center displays temporal excursions between 0.077 to\n0.198 AU (5 to 11% of the corresponding stellar radius), depending on the\nsimulation considered. We show that the convection-related variability accounts\nfor a substantial part to the Gaia DR2 parallax error of our sample of\nsemiregular variables. Finally, we put in evidence for a correlation between\nthe mean photo-center displacement and the stellar fundamental parameters:\nsurface gravity, radius, and pulsation.

Force\npenalty methods, while economic and accessible, introduce artificial stiffness,\nrequiring small time steps to retain numerical stability. Optimization-based\nmethods, which enforce contacts geometrically through complementarity\nconstraints, allow the use of larger time steps at the expense of solving a\nnonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) each time step. We review the latest\nefforts to produce solvers for this NCP, focusing on its relaxation to a cone\ncomplementarity problem (CCP) and solution via an equivalent quadratic\noptimization problem with conic constraints. We distinguish between linearly\nconvergent first order methods and second order methods, which gain quadratic\nconvergence and more robust performance at the expense of the solution of large\nsparse linear systems.\n  We propose a novel acceleration for the solution of Newton step linear\nsystems in second order methods using low-rank compression based fast direct\nsolvers. We use the Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) decomposition to produce\nefficient approximate representations of the system matrix and its inverse.\nThis provides a robust framework to accelerate its solution in a direct or a\npreconditioned iterative method. In a number of numerical tests, we demonstrate\nthat this approach displays sublinear scaling of precomputation costs, may be\nefficiently updated across Newton iterations as well as across time steps, and\nleads to a fast, optimal complexity solution of the Newton step. This allows\nour method to gain an order of magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art\npreconditioning techniques for moderate to large-scale systems, mitigating the\ncomputational bottleneck of second order methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 21:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

Integrating the entire domain with\nlow-Mach-number methods would remove all acoustic wave propagation, while\nintegrating the entire domain with the fully compressible equations can in some\ncases be prohibitively expensive due to the CFL time step constraint. For\nexample, simulation of thermoacoustic instabilities might require fine\nresolution of the fluid/chemistry interaction but not require fine resolution\nof acoustic effects, yet one does not want to neglect the long-wavelength wave\npropagation and its interaction with the larger domain. The present paper\nintroduces a new multi-level hybrid algorithm to address these types of\nphenomena. In this new approach, the fully compressible Euler equations are\nsolved on the entire domain, potentially with local refinement, while their\nlow-Mach-number counterparts are solved on subregions of the domain with higher\nspatial resolution. The finest of the compressible levels communicates\ninhomogeneous divergence constraints to the coarsest of the low-Mach-number\nlevels, allowing the low-Mach-number levels to retain the long-wavelength\nacoustics. The performance of the hybrid method is shown for a series of test\ncases, including results from a simulation of the aeroacoustic propagation\ngenerated from a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in low-Mach-number mixing layers.\nIt is demonstrated that compared to a purely compressible approach, the hybrid\nmethod allows time-steps two orders of magnitude larger at the finest level,\nleading to an overall reduction of the computational time by a factor of 8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 21:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

A central\ncontroller collects time-averaged traffic and channel conditions from all\naccess points and coordinates spectrum allocation, user association, and power\ncontrol throughout the network on an appropriate timescale. The timescale is\nconceived to be seconds in today's networks, and it is likely to become faster\nin the future. The coordination problem in each time epoch is formulated as a\nnetwork utility maximization problem, where any subset of access points may use\nany parts of the spectrum to serve any subsets of devices. It is proved that\nthe network utility can be maximized by an extremely sparse spectrum\nallocation. By exploiting this sparsity, an efficient iterative algorithm with\nguaranteed convergence is developed, each iteration of which is performed in\nclosed form. The proposed centralized optimization framework can incorporate a\nbroad class of utility functions that account for weighted sum rates, average\npacket delay, and/or energy consumption, along with very general constraints on\ntransmission powers. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of the\nalgorithm for networks with up to 1,000 access points and several thousand\ndevices. Moreover, the proposed scheme yields significantly improved throughput\nregion and average packet delay comparing with several well-known competing\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 23:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

A\nstate-of-the-art human pose estimation deep learning model then was trained\nfrom scratch using our ScanAva dataset and could achieve the pose estimation\naccuracy of 91.2% at PCK0.5 criteria after applying an efficient domain\nadaptation on the synthetic images, in which its pose estimation accuracy was\ncomparable to the same model trained on large scale pose data from real humans\nsuch as MPII dataset and much higher than the model trained on other synthetic\nhuman dataset such as SURREAL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 01:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 19:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

The goal is\nto improve content offloading over wireless device-to-device (D2D)\ncommunication links. In the considered network, users belong to different\nsocial communities while their UEs form a single multi-hop D2D network. The\nproposed framework allows to exploit the multi-community social context of\nusers for improving the local offloading of cached content in a multihop D2D\nnetwork. To model the collaborative effect of a set of UEs on content\noffloading, a cooperative game between the UEs is formulated. For this game, it\nis shown that the Shapley value (SV) of each UE effectively captures the impact\nof this UE on the overall content offloading process. To capture the presence\nof multiple social communities that connect the UEs, a hypergraph model is\nproposed. Two line graphs, an influence-weighted graph, and a\nconnectivity-weighted graph, are developed for analyzing the proposed hypergaph\nmodel. Using the developed line graphs along with the SV of the cooperative\ngame, a precise offloading power metric is derived for each UE within a\nmulti-community, multi-hop D2D network. Then, UEs with high offloading power\nare chosen as the optimal locations for caching the popular content.

The\nTOA-operator is constructed under the constraint that the inertial and\ngravitational masses are equivalent, and that Galilean invariance is preserved.\nThese constraints are implemented by Weyl-quantization of the corresponding\nclassical time of arrival function for the projectile. The expectation value of\nthe TOA-operator is explicitly shown to be equal to the classical time of\narrival plus mass-dependent quantum correction terms, implying incompatibility\nof the weak equivalence principle with quantum mechanics. The full extent of\nthe violation of the WEP is shown through the mass dependence of time of\narrival distribution for the projectile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 07:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 11:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 06:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Existing literature\ndevelops a variety of individual tests. Some of them are sensitive to the dense\nand small disturbance, and others are sensitive to the sparse and large\ndisturbance. Hence, the powers of these tests depend on the assumption of the\nalternative scenario. This paper provides a unified framework for developing\nnew tests which are adaptive to a large variety of alternative scenarios in\nhigh dimensions. In particular, our framework includes arbitrary hypotheses\nwhich can be tested using high dimensional $U$-statistic based vectors. Under\nthis framework, we first develop a broad family of tests based on a novel\nvariant of the $L_p$-norm with $p\\in \\{1,\\dots,\\infty\\}$. We then combine these\ntests to construct a data-adaptive test that is simultaneously powerful under\nvarious alternative scenarios. To obtain the asymptotic distributions of these\ntests, we utilize the multiplier bootstrap for $U$-statistics. In addition, we\nconsider the computational aspect of the bootstrap method and propose a novel\nlow-cost scheme. We prove the optimality of the proposed tests. Thorough\nnumerical results on simulated and real datasets are provided to support our\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 07:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

For increased interaction range $p=4$, we find that the\nphase transitions can also appear to be abrupt, as well as being mediated by\nre-emergent ordered phases that cross over into liquid behavior. These\nconsiderations are underpinned by a classification of the competing\ncharge-ordered states in the atomic limit for varying interaction range at the\nprincipal commensurable particle densities. We also consider the effects of\ndisorder, leading to fragmentization of the ordered phases and localization of\nthe liquid phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 10:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 17:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

This resistance is\ndescribed by a fourth-rank effective viscosity tensor. When the tensor is\nisotropic, two scalars determine the resistance: an effective shear and an\neffective bulk viscosity. Here, calculations are presented of the effective\nviscosity tensor during diffusion creep for a 2D tiling of hexagonal unit cells\nand a 3D tessellation of tetrakaidecahedrons (truncated octahedrons). The\ngeometry of the melt is determined by assuming textural equilibrium. The\nviscosity tensor for the 2D tiling is isotropic, but that for the 3D\ntessellation is anisotropic. Two parameters control the effect of melt on the\nviscosity tensor: the porosity and the dihedral angle. Calculations for both\nNabarro-Herring (volume diffusion) and Coble (surface diffusion) creep are\npresented. For Nabarro-Herring creep the bulk viscosity becomes singular as the\nporosity vanishes. This singularity is logarithmic, a weaker singularity than\ntypically assumed in geodynamic models. The presence of a small amount of melt\n(0.1% porosity) causes the effective shear viscosity to approximately halve.\nFor Coble creep, previous modelling work has argued that a very small amount of\nmelt may lead to a substantial, factor of 5, drop in the shear viscosity.

As a complementary analysis tool to\nconventional high-field NMR, zero- and ultralow-field (ZULF) NMR detects\nnuclear magnetization signals in the sub-microtesla regime. Current ZULF NMR\nsystems are always equipped with high-quality magnetic shieldings to ensure\nthat ambient magnetic field noise does not dwarf the magnetization signal. An\nalternative approach is to separate the magnetization signal from the noise\nbased on their differing spatial profiles, as can be achieved using a magnetic\ngradiometer.

Every limit\npoint of $n$-player equilibria is shown to be the same kind of weak MFG\nequilibrium as in the open-loop case.

Many simple NLG models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) and\nsequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, which basically contains an\nencoder-decoder structure; these NLG models generate sentences from scratch by\njointly optimizing sentence planning and surface realization using a simple\ncross entropy loss training criterion.

We tackle the\nglobal linear stability of 2D flows subject to small-amplitude 3D SP control.\nBuilding on previous work for parallel flows (Boujo et al. 2015), an adjoint\nmethod is proposed for computing the 2nd-order eigenvalue sensitivity. Such\ncontrol has a zero 1st-order linear effect, so the 2nd-order quadratic effect\nprevails. The sensitivity operator allows one (i) to predict the effect of any\ncontrol without computing the controlled flow, (ii) to compute the optimal\ncontrol for growth rate/frequency modification. The method takes advantage of\nspanwise periodicity to reduce computational complexity (from a 3D problem to a\n2D one). The approach is applied to the leading eigenvalue of the laminar flow\naround a circular cylinder. Two SP controls are explored: wall actuation\n(blowing/suction) and wall deformation. Decomposing the eigenvalue variation,\nwe find that the 3D contribution (from the SP 1st-order flow modification) is\ngenerally larger than the 2D one from the mean flow correction\n(spanwise-invariant 2nd-order flow modification). The optimal control for\nstabilization is top-down symmetric, leading to varicose streaks in the wake.\nAnalyzing the competition between amplification and stabilization shows that\noptimal varicose streaks are not significantly more amplified than sinuous ones\nbut have a stronger stabilizing effect. The optimal wall deformation induces a\nflow modification similar to that of the optimal wall actuation. In general,\nspanwise and tangential actuation have a small contribution to the optimal\ncontrol, so normal-only actuation is a good trade-off between simplicity and\neffectiveness. Our method opens the way to the systematic design of optimal SP\ncontrol for a variety of control objectives other than linear stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 14:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 11:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

While msEPI can mitigate these artifacts, high-quality msEPI has been\nelusive because of phase mismatch arising from shot-to-shot variations which\npreclude the combination of the multiple-shot data into a single image.

Even\nthough Gaia DR2 photometry is very precise, there are currently three\nalternative definitions of the sensitivity curves that show significative\ndifferences. AIMS: The aim of this paper is to improve the quality of the input\ncalibration data to produce new compatible definitions of the three bands and\nto identify the reasons for the discrepancies between previous definitions.\nMETHODS: We have searched the HST archive for STIS spectra with G430L+G750L\ndata obtained with wide apertures and combined them with the CALSPEC library to\nproduce a high quality SED library of 122 stars with a broad range of colors,\nincluding three very red stars. We have used it to compute new sensitivity\ncurves for G, BP, and RP using a functional analytical formalism. RESULTS: The\nnew curves are significantly better than the two previous attempts, REV and\nWEI. For G we confirm the existence of a systematic bias in magnitude and\ncorrect a color term present in REV. For BP we confirm the need to define two\nmagnitude ranges with different sensitivity curves and measure the cut between\nthem at G = 10.87 with a significant increase in precision. The new curves also\nfit the data better than either REV or WEI. For RP we obtain a sensitivity\ncurve that better fits the STIS spectra and we find that the differences with\nprevious attempts reside in a systematic effect between ground-based and HST\nspectral libraries. Additional evidence from color-color diagrams indicate that\nthe new sensitivity curve is more accurate. Nevertheless, there is still room\nfor improvement in the accuracy of the sensitivity curves because of the\ncurrent dearth of good-quality red calibrators: adding more to the sample\nshould be a priority before Gaia data release 3 takes place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 15:21:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 07:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

This paper considers exploiting spatial caching\ndiversity (i.e., caching different subsets of popular content files at\nneighboring BSs) that can greatly improve the cache hit probability, thereby\nleading to a better overall system performance. A key issue in exploiting\nspatial caching diversity is that the cached content may not be located at the\nnearest BS, which means that to access such content, a user needs to overcome\nstrong interference from the nearby BSs; this significantly limits the gain of\nspatial caching diversity. In this paper, we consider a joint design of\nfrequency reuse and caching, such that the benefit of an improved cache hit\nprobability induced by spatial caching diversity and the benefit of\ninterference coordination induced by frequency reuse can be achieved\nsimultaneously. We obtain a closed-form characterization of the approximate\nsuccessful transmission probability for the proposed scheme and analyze the\nimpact of key operating parameters on the performance. We design a\nlow-complexity algorithm to optimize the frequency reuse factor and the cache\nstorage allocation.

In this paper we present an overview of positive ion production in\nsaddle antenna (helicon discharge) radio frequency (SA RF) ion sources. The\nefficiency of H+ ion production in recently developed RF sources with\nsolenoidal antennas was improved to 2.9 mA/kW. About 24 kW of RF power is\ntypically needed for 70 mA beam current production from a 7 mm emission\naperture. This efficiency is relatively low because in the RF discharge with a\nsolenoidal antenna, the plasma is generated near the coil and diffuses to the\naxis creating a nearly uniform plasma density distribution in all cross\nsections of the discharge chamber, when the plasma flow is necessary only near\nan emission aperture. The efficiency of the extracted ion generation was\nimproved significantly by using a saddle antenna with solenoidal magnetic\nfield. In the RF discharge with the saddle antenna the plasma is generated near\nthe axis and the magnetic field suppress the plasma diffusion from the axis,\ncreating a peaked plasma density distribution on the emission aperture. With\nthe SA the efficiency of positive ion generation in the plasma has been\nimproved up to ~100 mA/cm2 per kW of RF power at 13.56 MHz. Continuous wave\n(CW) operation of the RF source has been tested on the small ORNL SNS test\nstand. The general design of the CW RF source is based on the pulsed version.

This uniformly covers the entire area and velocity range of the\ntriplet with a resolution of ~20'' or ~420 pc. The data reveal many small-scale\nanomalous velocity features highlighting the complexity of the interacting M81\ntriplet. We compare our data with Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations of\nthe same area. This provides evidence for a substantial reservoir of low-column\ndensity gas in the northern part of the triplet, probably associated with M82.\nSuch a reservoir is not found in the southern part. We report a number of\nkpc-sized low-mass HI clouds with HI masses of a few times 10^6 Msun. Their\ndynamical masses are much larger than their baryonic masses, which could\nindicate the presence of dark matter if the clouds are rotationally supported.\nHowever, due to their spatial and kinematical association with HI tidal\nfeatures, it is more likely that the velocity widths indicate tidal effects or\nstreaming motions.

We find that mobility is slightly harmful for solving\neasy problems, i.e. problems that do not exhibit suboptimal solutions or local\nmaxima.

A large\nbody of work on this subject has already been performed and platforms known as\nDSPs are available on the market that deal with such an optimization. From the\nadvertiser's point of view, each DSP is a different black box, with its pros\nand cons, that needs to be configured. In order to take advantage of the pros\nof every DSP, advertisers are well-advised to use a combination of them when\nsetting up their campaigns. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for\nadvertisers to add an optimization layer on top of DSPs. The algorithm we\nintroduce, called SKOTT, maximizes the chosen KPI by optimally configuring the\nDSPs and putting them in competition with each other. SKOTT is a highly\nspecialized iterative algorithm loosely based on gradient descent that is made\nup of three independent sub-routines, each dealing with a different problem:\npartitioning the budget, setting the desired average bid, and preventing\nunder-delivery. In particular, one of the novelties of our approach lies in our\ntaking the perspective of the advertisers rather than the DSPs. Synthetic\nmarket data is used to evaluate the efficiency of SKOTT against other\nstate-of-the-art approaches adapted from similar problems. The results\nillustrate the benefits of our proposals, which greatly outperforms the other\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 19:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

Understanding spatio-temporal aspects of the spread mechanism are\nessential for better management in the region. The objective of the present\nstudy is to develop insight into some key characteristics of the regulatory\nmechanism for lantana spread inside RTR. Lantana mapping was carried out by\nfield observations along multiple transects and plots and the data generated\nwas used as input for MaxEnt modelling to identify land patches in the study\narea that are favourable for lantana growth. The patch information so obtained\nis integrated with a raster map generated by identifying different\ntopographical features in the study area which are favourable for lantana\ngrowth. The integrated data is analysed with a complex network perspective,\nwhere relatively dense potential lantana distribution patches are considered as\nvertices, connected by relatively sparse lantana continuities, identified as\nedges. The network centrality analysis reveal key patches in the study area\nthat play specialized roles in the spread of lantana in a large region. Hubs in\nthe lantana network are primarily identified as dry seasonal river beds and\ntheir management is proposed as a vital strategy to contain lantana invasion.\nThe lantana network is found to exhibit small-world architecture with a well\nformed community structure.

This article presents\na human activity recognition approach to detect the starting movement of\ncyclists wearing smart devices. We propose a novel two-stage feature selection\nprocedure using a score specialized for robust starting detection reducing the\nfalse positive detections and leading to understandable and interpretable\nfeatures. The detection is modelled as a classification problem and realized by\nmeans of a machine learning classifier. We introduce an auxiliary class, that\nmodels starting movements and allows to integrate early movement indicators,\ni.e., body part movements indicating future behaviour. In this way we improve\nthe robustness and reduce the detection time of the classifier. Our empirical\nstudies with real-world data originating from experiments which involve 49 test\nsubjects and consists of 84 starting motions show that we are able to detect\nthe starting movements early. Our approach reaches an F1-score of 67 % within\n0.33 s after the first movement of the bicycle wheel. Investigations concerning\nthe device wearing location show that for devices worn in the trouser pocket\nthe detector has less false detections and detects starting movements faster on\naverage. We found that we can further improve the results when we train\ndistinct classifiers for different wearing locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 09:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}
