This method generalises existing template-based\nBayesian photometric redshift (BPZ) methods, and produces joint posterior\ndistributions for the component redshifts that allow uncertainties to be\npropagated in a principled way. Using Bayesian model comparison, we infer the\nprobability that a source is blended and the number of components that it\ncontains. We extend our formalism to the case where sources are blended in some\nbands and resolved in others. Applying this to the combination of LSST- and\nEuclid-like surveys, we find that the addition of resolved photometry results\nin a significant improvement in the reduction of outliers over the\nfully-blended case.

Combined with a time-windowed\napproach, thin plate splines visualizations revealed that the average violin\noutline has remained mostly stable over time, not adhering to any particular\ntrends of design across different periods in music history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 16:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

The same analysis is applied to synthetic column density\nmaps, generated from numerical turbulent molecular cloud models and from\nfractal Brownian motion (fBm), allowing for the confrontation of the\nobservations with models with well controlled physical parameters. This\ncomparison shows that, in terms of multifractal descriptors of the structure,\nfBm images exhibit a very different, quite unrealistic behaviour when compared\nwith Hi-GAL observations, whereas the numerical simulations appear in some\ncases (depending on the specific model) more similar to the observations.\nFinally, the link between mono-fractal parameters (commonly found in the\nliterature) and multifractal indicators is investigated: the former appear to\nbe only partially connected with the latter, with the multifractal analysis\noffering a more extended and complete characterization of the cloud structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 16:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

A stiff coupling\nbetween the gas and dust phases is typical for such disks, with the dust\nstopping time much less than the characteristic dynamical time scale. This\nimposes high demands on the methods used to simulate the dust dynamics. A grid,\npiecewise-parabolic method is used as the basic algorithm for solving the\ngas-dynamical equations. Numerical solutions obtained using various methods to\ncompute the momentum exchanges are presented for the case of monodisperse dust.\nNumerical solutions are obtained for shock tube problem and the propagation of\nsound waves in a gas-dust medium.

The standoff\ndistance is influenced by a number of additional effects, e.g. (1) the\ngravitational pull of the main cluster (causing acceleration/deceleration of\nthe infalling subcluster), (2) the density and pressure gradients of the\natmosphere in the main cluster, (3) the non-spherical shape of the subcluster,\nand (4) projection effects. The first two effects tend to bias the standoff\ndistance in the same direction, pushing the bow shock closer to (farther away\nfrom) the subcluster during the pre- (post-)merger stages. Particularly, in the\npost-merger stage, the shock could be much farther away from the subcluster\nthan predicted by a model of a body moving at a constant speed in a uniform\nmedium. This implies that a combination of the standoff distance with\nmeasurements of the Mach number from density/temperature jumps can provide\nimportant information on the merger, e.g. differentiating between the pre- and\npost-merger stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 19:33:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 23:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

Our results pave the way for experimentally exploring the\nintriguing long-sought-after quantum advantages in machine learning tasks with\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

In this paper, we\npursue the opposite direction by deriving lower complexity bounds of\nfirst-order methods on large-scale SPPs. Our results apply to the methods whose\niterates are in the linear span of past first-order information, as well as\nmore general methods that produce their iterates in an arbitrary manner based\non first-order information. We first work on the affinely constrained smooth\nconvex optimization that is a special case of SPP. Different from gradient\nmethod on unconstrained problems, we show that first-order methods on affinely\nconstrained problems generally cannot be accelerated from the known convergence\nrate $O(1/t)$ to $O(1/t^2)$, and in addition, $O(1/t)$ is optimal for convex\nproblems. Moreover, we prove that for strongly convex problems, $O(1/t^2)$ is\nthe best possible convergence rate, while it is known that gradient methods can\nhave linear convergence on unconstrained problems. Then we extend these results\nto general SPPs. It turns out that our lower complexity bounds match with\nseveral established upper complexity bounds in the literature, and thus they\nare tight and indicate the optimality of several existing first-order methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 18:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

The performance of any IR method critically\ndepends on selecting an appropriate similarity measure for the given\napplication domain. Since different SE tasks operate on different document\ntypes like bug reports, software descriptions, source code, etc. that often\ncontain non-standard domain-specific vocabulary, it is essential to understand\nwhich similarity measures work best for different SE documents.\n  This paper presents two case studies on the effect of different similarity\nmeasure on various SE documents w.r.t. two tasks: (i) project recommendation:\nfinding similar GitHub projects and (ii) bug localization: retrieving buggy\nsource file(s) correspond to a bug report. These tasks contain a diverse\ncombination of textual (i.e. description, readme) and code (i.e. source code,\nAPI, import package) artifacts. We observe that the performance of IR models\nvaries when applied to different artifact types. We find that, in general, the\ncontext-aware models achieve better performance on textual artifacts. In\ncontrast, simple keyword-based bag-of-words models perform better on code\nartifacts. On the other hand, the probabilistic ranking model BM25 performs\nbetter on a mixture of text and code artifacts.\n  We further investigate how such an informed choice of similarity measure\nimpacts the performance of SE tools. In particular, we analyze two previously\nproposed tools for project recommendation and bug localization tasks, which\nleverage diverse software artifacts, and observe that an informed choice of\nsimilarity measure indeed leads to improved performance of the existing SE\ntools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 18:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

The retinal layer\nboundary model consists of 9 open parametric contours representing the 9\nretinal layers in OCT images. An intensity-based Mumford-Shah (MS) variational\nfunctional is first defined to evolve the retinal layer boundary model to\nsegment the 9 layers simultaneously. By making use of the normals of open\nparametric contours, we construct equal sized adjacent narrowbands that are\ndivided by each contour. Regional information in each narrowband can thus be\nintegrated into the MS energy functional such that its optimisation is robust\nagainst different initialisations. A statistical prior is also imposed on the\nshape of the segmented parametric contours for the functional. As such, by\nminimising the MS energy functional the parametric contours can be driven\ntowards the true boundaries of retinal layers, while the similarity of the\ncontours with respect to training OCT shapes is preserved. Experimental results\non real OCT images demonstrate that the method is accurate and robust to low\nquality OCT images with low contrast and high-level speckle noise, and it\noutperforms the recent geodesic distance based method for segmenting 9 layers\nof the retina in OCT images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 19:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

We provide an interpretation of the band\nstructure of nanowires, grown along the [111] (zinc-blende structure) and the\n[0001] (wurtzite structure) directions, in terms of the bulk band structures of\nthe corresponding binary compounds. The procedure reveals the origin of the\nvalence and conduction valleys relevant to determine the nature (direct or\nindirect) of the band gaps and the kind (direct and pseudodirect) of the\nvalence to conduction transitions.

Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are easy to\ndeploy, update, monitor, and manage. The number of VNF instances, similar to\ngeneric computing resources in cloud, can be easily scaled based on load.\nHence, auto-scaling (of resources without human intervention) has been\nreceiving attention.

The instance of the\nATSP is solved using the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun heuristic, and the result is\ninversely transformed to the GHMDATSP-formatted instance to obtain a set of\ntours.

In principle,\nrandomly generated Gaussian measurement matrices are \"order-optimal\". So we\ncompare the phase transition behavior of the basis pursuit formulation using\nbinary array codes and Gaussian matrices and show that (i) there is essentially\nno difference between the phase transition boundaries in the two cases and (ii)\nthe CPU time of basis pursuit with binary matrices is hundreds of times faster\nthan with Gaussian matrices and the storage requirements are less. Therefore it\nis suggested that binary matrices are a viable alternative to Gaussian matrices\nfor compressed sensing using basis pursuit. \\end{abstract}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 02:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 16:47:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 16:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

By\nTheorem 3.26, it is consistent that for any club $C$ on the first measurable\n$\\mu$, JEP holds exactly on $\\lim C$ and everywhere above $\\mu$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 04:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 21:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

Usually a word problem is a narrative comprising of a few sentences\nand a question is asked about a quantity referred in the sentences. Solving\nword problem involves reasoning across sentences, identification of operations,\ntheir order, relevant quantities and discarding irrelevant quantities. In this\npaper, we present a novel approach for automatic arithmetic word problem\nsolving. Our approach starts with frame identification. Each frame can either\nbe classified as a state or an action frame. The frame identification is\ndependent on the verb in a sentence. Every frame is unique and is identified by\nits slots. The slots are filled using dependency parsed output of a sentence.\nThe slots are entity holder, entity, quantity of the entity, recipient,\nadditional information like place, time. The slots and frames helps to identify\nthe type of question asked and the entity referred. Action frames act on state\nframe(s) which causes a change in quantities of the state frames. The frames\nare then used to build a graph where any change in quantities can be propagated\nto the neighboring nodes. Most of the current solvers can only answer questions\nrelated to the quantity, while our system can answer different kinds of\nquestions like `who', `what' other than the quantity related questions `how\nmany'.\n  There are three major contributions of this paper. 1.

The onset of instability and its physical mechanism are captured in\nterms of the singular values of the propagator matrix corresponding to the\nnon-autonomous linear equations. We discuss two types of non-monotonic\nviscosity profiles, namely, with unfavorable (when a less viscous fluid\ndisplaces a high viscous fluid) and with favorable (when a more viscous fluid\ndisplaces a less viscous fluid) end-point viscosities. A linear stability\nanalysis yields instabilities for such viscosity variations. In addition, we\nalso show that to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of the perturbations\nit is necessary to analyse the viscosity gradient with respect to the\nconcentration and the location of the maximum concentration $c_m$. For the\nfavorable end-point viscosities, a weak transient instability is observed when\nthe viscosity maximum moves close to the pure invading or defending fluid. This\ninstability is attributed to an interplay between the sharp viscosity gradient\nand the favorable end-point viscosity contrast. We demonstrate the\ndissimilarity between the quasi-steady-state approach and NMA in finding the\ncorrect perturbation structure and the onset, for both the favorable and\nunfavorable viscosity profiles. The correctness of the linear perturbation\nstructure obtained from the non-modal stability analysis is validated through\nnonlinear simulations. We have found that the nonlinear simulations and NMA\nresults are in good agreement. In summary, a non-monotonic variation of the\nviscosity of a miscible fluid pair is seen to have a larger influence on the\nonset of fingering instabilities, than the corresponding Arrhenius type\nrelationship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 06:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Successful virtual network service composition and\nmaintenance requires flexible and scalable 'constrained shortest path\nmanagement' both in the management plane for virtual network embedding (VNE) or\nnetwork function virtualization service chaining (NFV-SC), as well as in the\ndata plane for traffic engineering (TE). In this paper, we show analytically\nand empirically that leveraging constrained shortest paths within recent VNE,\nNFV-SC and TE algorithms can lead to network utilization gains (of up to 50%)\nand higher energy efficiency. The management of complex VNE, NFV-SC and TE\nalgorithms can be, however, intractable for large scale substrate networks due\nto the NP-hardness of the constrained shortest path problem. To address such\nscalability challenges, we propose a novel, exact constrained shortest path\nalgorithm viz., 'Neighborhoods Method' (NM).

By reducing the material\nthickness and forming a heterointerface, we find two types of charge-ordering\ntransitions in monolayer VSe2 on graphene substrates. Angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) uncovers that Fermi-surface nesting becomes\nperfect in ML VSe2. Renormalization group analysis confirms that imperfect\nnesting in three dimensions universally flows into perfect nesting in two\ndimensions. As a result, the charge density wave transition temperature is\ndramatically enhanced to a value of 350 K compared to the 105 K in bulk VSe2.\nMore interestingly, ARPES and scanning tunneling microscopy measurements\nconfirm an unexpected metal-insulator transition at 135 K, driven by lattice\ndistortions. The heterointerface plays an important role in driving this novel\nmetal-insulator transition in the family of monolayered transition metal\ndichalcogenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 06:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

Large enhancements in the emission and the\nradiation of the emitter occur due to the coupling with the antenna surface\nplasmons in the spectral region from 4THz to 15THz.

Existing statistical methods to combine prevalence data from\nmultiple diagnostics ignore the potential over-dispersion induced by the\nspatial correlations in the data. To address this issue, we develop a\ngeostatistical framework that allows for joint modelling of data from multiple\ndiagnostics by considering two main classes of inferential problems: (1) to\npredict prevalence for a gold-standard diagnostic using low-cost and\npotentially biased alternative tests; (2) to carry out joint prediction of\nprevalence from multiple tests.

We also develop a Monte\nCarlo procedure based on the variogram in order to identify parsimonious\ngeostatistical models that are compatible with the data.

We find matching model light curves that involve either a binary\nlens or a binary source. Our binary-lens models indicate a planet of mass $M_2$\n= (45 $\\pm$ 9) $M_\\oplus$, orbiting a star of mass $M_1$ = (0.35 $\\pm$ 0.06)\n$M_\\odot$, located at a distance $D_\\mathrm{L}$ = (1.7 $\\pm$ 0.3) kpc from\nEarth, whereas our binary-source models suggest a brown-dwarf lens of $M$ =\n(0.046 $\\pm$ 0.007) $M_\\odot$, located at a distance $D_\\mathrm{L}$ = (5.7\n$\\pm$ 0.9) kpc, with the source potentially being a (partially) eclipsing\nbinary involving stars predicted to be of similar colour given the ratios\nbetween the luminosities and radii. The ambiguity in the interpretation would\nbe resolved in favour of a lens binary by observing the luminous lens star\nseparating from the source at the predicted proper motion of $\\mu$ = (1.6 $\\pm$\n0.3) mas yr$^{-1}$, whereas it would be resolved in favour of a source binary\nif the source could be shown to be a (partially) eclipsing binary matching the\nobtained model parameters. We experienced that close binary source stars pose a\nchallenge for claiming the detection of planets by microlensing in events where\nthe source passes very close to the lens star hosting the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 13:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

On the one hand, the robots can be tools and models to\nanalyse animal collective behaviours, on the other hand, the robots and their\nartificial intelligence are directly confronted and compared to the natural\nanimal collective intelligence. The first step is to design robots and their\nbehavioural controllers that are capable of socially interact with animals.\nDesigning such behavioural bio-mimetic controllers remains an important\nchallenge as they have to reproduce the animal behaviours and have to be\ncalibrated on experimental data. Most animal collective behavioural models are\ndesigned by modellers based on experimental data. This process is long and\ncostly because it is difficult to identify the relevant behavioural features\nthat are then used as a priori knowledge in model building. Here, we want to\nmodel the fish individual and collective behaviours in order to develop robot\ncontrollers. We explore the use of optimised black-box models based on\nartificial neural networks (ANN) to model fish behaviours. While the ANN may\nnot be biomimetic but rather bio-inspired, they can be used to link perception\nto motor responses. These models are designed to be implementable as robot\ncontrollers to form mixed-groups of fish and robots, using few a priori\nknowledge of the fish behaviours. We present a methodology with multilayer\nperceptron or echo state networks that are optimised through evolutionary\nalgorithms to model accurately the fish individual and collective behaviours in\na bounded rectangular arena. We assess the biomimetism of the generated models\nand compare them to the fish experimental behaviours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 13:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

Our\nconstructions explain why and under which assumptions critical points of causal\nvariational principles give rise to a second-quantized, unitary dynamics on\nFock spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 14:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 19:52:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 09:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Due to\nthis model, it is vital to avoid blocking the UI thread for responsiveness. One\ncommon practice is to offload long-running tasks into async threads. To achieve\nthis, Android provides various async programming constructs, and leaves\ndevelopers themselves to obey the rules implied by the model. However, as our\nstudy reveals, more than 25% apps violate these rules and introduce\nhard-to-detect, fail-stop errors, which we term as aysnc programming errors\n(APEs). To this end, this paper introduces APEChecker, a technique to\nautomatically and efficiently manifest APEs. The key idea is to characterize\nAPEs as specific fault patterns, and synergistically combine static analysis\nand dynamic UI exploration to detect and verify such errors. Among the 40\nreal-world Android apps, APEChecker unveils and processes 61 APEs, of which 51\nare confirmed (83.6% hit rate). Specifically, APEChecker detects 3X more APEs\nthan the state-of-art testing tools (Monkey, Sapienz and Stoat), and reduces\ntesting time from half an hour to a few minutes. On a specific type of APEs,\nAPEChecker confirms 5X more errors than the data race detection tool,\nEventRacer, with very few false alarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 14:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

The observable physical effect is unidirectional robust transport,\nunaffected by defects or disorder. TIs were originally observed in the integer\nquantum Hall effect for fermionic systems of correlated electrons. However,\nduring the past decade the concepts of topological physics have been introduced\ninto numerous fields beyond condensed matter, ranging from microwaves and\nphotonic systems to cold atoms, acoustics and even mechanics. Recently, TIs\nwere proposed in exciton-polariton systems organized as honeycomb lattices,\nunder the influence of a magnetic field. Topological phenomena in polaritons\nare fundamentally different from all topological effects demonstrated\nexperimentally thus far: exciton-polaritons are part-light part-matter\nquasiparticles emerging from the strong coupling of quantum well excitons and\ncavity photons. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the first exciton-polariton\nTI. This constitutes the first symbiotic light-matter TIs. Our polariton\nlattice is excited non-resonantly, and the chiral topological polariton edge\nmode is populated by a polariton condensation mechanism. We image real- and\nFourier-space to measure photoluminescence, and demonstrate that the\ntopological edge mode avoids defects, and that the propagation direction of the\nmode can be reversed by inverting the applied magnetic field.

This kind of noise is poorly understood in all the stars, but\nthe Sun, due to their unresolved surfaces. For these reasons, the effects of\nthe surface inhomogeneities on the measurement of the RV are very difficult to\ncharacterize.

Ideally, instead of a fixed heuristic, we\nwould want a strategy to guide the search space in a more data-driven\nway---tailoring the search to a specific dataset and query workload.\nRecognizing the link between classical Dynamic Programming enumeration methods\nand recent results in Reinforcement Learning (RL), we propose a new method for\nlearning optimized join search strategies. We present our RL-based DQ\noptimizer, which currently optimizes select-project-join blocks. We implement\nthree versions of DQ to illustrate the ease of integration into existing\nDBMSes: (1) A version built on top of Apache Calcite, (2) a version integrated\ninto PostgreSQL, and (3) a version integrated into SparkSQL. Our extensive\nevaluation shows that DQ achieves plans with optimization costs and query\nexecution times competitive with the native query optimizer in each system, but\ncan execute significantly faster after learning (often by orders of magnitude).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 15:30:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 20:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

Localization entails the determination of position of the\ncenter of mass and orientation of a vehicle from the available measurements. In\nthis paper, we focus on localization by using One-Way Travel Time (OWTT)\nmeasurements available to a vehicle from the communication of its multiple\non-board receivers with acoustic beacons, more specifically, long baseline\n(LBL) beacons. Range can be inferred by multiplying the OWTT with speed of\nsound; however, water conditions can change spatially and temporally resulting\nin uncertainty in range measurement. The farther a beacon is from a receiver,\nthe larger is the uncertainty. The proposed method for localization accounts\ncaptures this uncertainty by bounding the true distance with an increasing\n(calibrating) function of the range measurement. Determination of this\ncalibration function is formulated as polynomial optimization problem and is a\ncrucial step for localization. The proposed two-step procedure for localization\nis as follows: based on the range measurements specific to a receiver from the\nbeacons, a convex optimization problem is proposed to estimate the location of\nthe receiver. The estimate is essentially a center of the set of possible\nlocations of the receiver. In the second step, the location estimates of the\nvehicle are corrected using rigid body motion constraints and the orientation\nof the rigid body is thus determined. Numerical examples and experimental\nresults provided at the end corroborate the procedures developed in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 15:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 22:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

Each node holds a dynamic state and\ninteracts with its neighbors through an undirected connected graph, where along\neach link the pair of nodes share information. Due to the data-rate constraint,\neach node builds an encoder-decoder pair, with which it produces transmitted\nmessage with a zooming-in finite-level uniform quantizer and also generates\nestimates of its neighbors' states from the received signals. We then propose a\ndistributed quantized algorithm and show that when the network linear equations\nadmit a unique solution, each node's state is driven to that solution\nexponentially. We further establish the asymptotic rate of convergence, which\nshows that a larger number of quantization levels leads to a faster convergence\nrate but is still fundamentally bounded by the inherent network structure and\nthe linear equations. When a unique least-squares solution exists, we show that\nthe algorithm can compute such a solution with a suitably selected time-varying\nstep size inherited from the encoder and zooming-in quantizer dynamics.

The central idea behind\nthese strategies, is first to represent polymers by chains of large soft blobs\n(spheres) and efficiently equilibrate the melt on mesoscopic scale. Then, the\ndegrees of freedom of more detailed models are reinserted step by step. The\nprocedure terminates when the atomistic description is reached. Reinsertions\nare feasible computationally because the fine-grained melt must be\nre-equilibrated only locally. To develop the method, we choose a polymer with\nsufficient complexity.

The SN was discovered and monitored in near-UV and R bands as part of\na joint GALEX and Palomar Transient Factory campaign. It is among the most\nenergetic Type IIn supernovae observed to date (~10^{51} erg). If the radiated\nenergy mainly came from the thermalization of the shock kinetic energy, we show\nthat PTF12glz was surrounded by ~1 solar mass of circumstellar material (CSM)\nprior to its explosive death. PTF12glz shows a puzzling peculiarity: at early\ntimes, while the freely expanding ejecta are presumably masked by the optically\nthick CSM, the radius of the blackbody that best fits the observations grows at\n~7000 km/s. Such a velocity is characteristic of fast moving ejecta rather than\noptically thick CSM. This phase of radial expansion takes place before any\nspectroscopic signature of expanding ejecta appears in the spectrum and while\nboth the spectroscopic data and the bolometric luminosity seem to indicate that\nthe CSM is optically thick. We propose a geometrical solution to this puzzle,\ninvolving an aspherical structure of the CSM around PTF12glz. By modelling\nradiative diffusion through a slab of CSM, we show that an aspherical geometry\nof the CSM can result in a growing effective radius.

For example, a\ngraph of biological pathways can be used for discovering a previously unknown\nrelationship between two proteins. Domain experts, however, may be reluctant to\ntrust such a discovery without a detailed explanation as to why exactly the two\nproteins are deemed related in the graph. This paper provides an overview of\nthe types of solutions, their associated methods and strategies, that have been\nproposed for finding entity relatedness explanations in graphs. The first type\nof solution relies on information inherent to the paths connecting the\nentities. This type of solution provides entity relatedness explanations in the\nform of a list of ranked paths. The rank of a path is measured in terms of\nimportance, uniqueness, novelty and informativeness. The second type of\nsolution relies on measures of node relevance. In this case, the relevance of\nnodes is measured w.r.t. the entities of interest, and relatedness explanations\nare provided in the form of a subgraph that maximises node relevance scores.\nThis paper uses this classification of approaches to discuss and contrast some\nof the key concepts that guide different solutions to the problem of entity\nrelatedness explanation in graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 10:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}
