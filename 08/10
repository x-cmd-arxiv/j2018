However, several physical\nproperties that characterize their behavior, such as charged defect ionization\nenergies, are difficult to simulate with conventional first-principles methods,\nmainly because of the weak and anisotropic dielectric screening caused by the\nreduced dimensionality. We establish fundamental principles for accurate and\nefficient calculations of charged defect ionization energies and electronic\nstructure in ultrathin 2D materials. We propose to use the vacuum level as the\nreference for defect charge transition levels (CTLs) because it gives robust\nresults insensitive to the level of theory, unlike commonly used band edge\npositions. Furthermore, we determine the fraction of Fock exchange in hybrid\nfunctionals for accurate band gaps and band edge positions of 2D materials by\nenforcing the generalized Koopmans' condition of localized defect states. We\nfound the obtained fractions of Fock exchange vary significantly from 0.2 for\nbulk $h$-BN to 0.4 for monolayer $h$-BN, whose band gaps are also in good\nagreement with experimental results and calculated GW results. The combination\nof these methods allows for reliable and efficient prediction of defect\nionization energies (difference between CTLs and band edge positions). We\nmotivate and generalize these findings with several examples including\ndifferent defects in monolayer to few-layer hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN),\nmonolayer MoS$_2$ and graphane. Finally, we show that increasing the number of\nlayers of $h$-BN systematically lowers defect ionization energies, mainly\nthrough CTLs shifting towards vacuum, with conduction band minima kept almost\nunchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 16:28:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 00:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

One explanation for the popularity\nof HMC algorithms is their excellent performance as the dimension $d$ of the\ntarget becomes large: under conditions that are satisfied for many common\nstatistical models, optimally-tuned HMC algorithms have a running time that\nscales like $d^{0.25}$. In stark contrast, the running time of the usual\nRandom-Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm, optimally tuned, scales like $d$. This\nsuperior scaling of the HMC algorithm with dimension is attributed to the fact\nthat it, unlike RWM, incorporates the gradient information in the proposal\ndistribution. In this paper, we investigate a different scaling question: does\nHMC beat RWM for highly $\\textit{multimodal}$ targets? We find that the answer\nis often $\\textit{no}$. We compute the spectral gaps for both the algorithms\nfor a specific class of multimodal target densities, and show that they are\nidentical. The key reason is that, within one mode, the gradient is effectively\nignorant about other modes, thus negating the advantage the HMC algorithm\nenjoys in unimodal targets. We also give heuristic arguments suggesting that\nthe above observation may hold quite generally. Our main tool for answering\nthis question is a novel simple formula for the conductance of HMC using\nLiouville's theorem.

Among the processes of interest, the\nproduction of heavy elements in core-collapse supernovae is strongly dependent\nupon neutrino properties, like the mixing between different species of\nneutrinos. In this work we study the effects of neutrino oscillations upon the\nelectron fraction as a function of the neutrino mixing parameters, for two\nschemes: the $1+1$ scheme (one active neutrino and one sterile neutrino) and\nthe $2+1$ scheme (two active neutrinos and one sterile neutrino).

A novel fabrication\napproach is proposed and applied to fully free-standing ultrathin capacitors\nfabrication, having an overall thickness as low as 200 nm; that represents, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the thinnest free-standing capacitors ever reported.\nThanks to the ultra-low thickness, the proposed capacitors are able to sustain\nflexure to extremely small curvature radii (as low as 1.5 {\\mu}m) and to\nconform to complex surfaces, such as a nylon mesh with micrometric texture\nwithout compromising their operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 17:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

In this\nwork we investigate the origin of such a reversal in stellar age gradient, by\nusing a simulated M33 analogue from the Constrained Local UniversE Simulations\n(CLUES). The simulated M33 is similar to the observed one in terms of mass,\nrotation velocity, surface brightness and, similar to what has been reported in\nobservations, shows a stellar age turnaround at large radii. We demonstrate\nthat this reversal is mostly a result of stellar accretion from old satellite\ngalaxies and, to a lesser extent, of stellar migration of in-situ stars. The\nold accreted stars, with formation times tf < 4 Gyrs, are kinematically hot and\ncan be differentiated from the in-situ stars by their high velocity dispersion\nand the fact that they do not have rotationally-supported orbits. In the\nfuture, obtaining kinematic information of the stars in the outskirt of M33\nwill help to verify this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 18:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

Temperature fluctuations from X-ray heating of the\nneutral intergalactic medium can dominate the fluctuations in the 21-cm signal\nfrom this time. This heating depends on the abundance, clustering, and\nproperties of the X-ray sources present, which remain highly uncertain. We\npresent a suite of three new large-volume, 349\\,Mpc a side, fully numerical\nradiative transfer simulations including QSO-like sources, extending the work\npreviously presented in Ross et al. (2017). The results show that our QSOs have\na modest contribution to the heating budget, yet significantly impact the 21-cm\nsignal. Initially, the power spectrum is boosted on large scales by heating\nfrom the biased QSO-like sources, before decreasing on all scales. Fluctuations\nfrom images of the 21-cm signal with resolutions corresponding to SKA1-Low at\nthe appropriate redshifts are well above the expected noise for deep\nintegrations, indicating that imaging could be feasible for all the X-ray\nsource models considered. The most notable contribution of the QSOs is a\ndramatic increase in non-Gaussianity of the signal, as measured by the skewness\nand kurtosis of the 21-cm probability distribution functions. However, in the\ncase of late Lyman-$\\alpha$ saturation, this non-Gaussianity could be\ndramatically decreased particularly when heating occurs earlier. We conclude\nthat increased non-Gaussianity is a promising signature of rare X-ray sources\nat this time, provided that Lyman-$\\alpha$ saturation occurs before heating\ndominates the 21-cm signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 18:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 04:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

The resulting planetary distribution is\ncompared with the observed population of extrasolar planets, and the model\nparameters are improved iteratively using a particle swarm optimization scheme.\nThe characteristics of the final planetary systems are mainly controlled by the\npebble isolation mass, which is the mass of a planet that perturbs nearby gas\nenough to halt the inward flux of drifting pebbles and stop growth. The pebble\nisolation mass increases with orbital distance so that giant planet cores can\nonly form in the outer disk. Giants migrate inwards, populating a wide range of\nfinal orbital distances. The best model fits have large initial protoplanet\nmasses, short pebble drift timescales, low disk viscosities, and short\natmospheric cooling times, all of which promote rapid growth. The model\nsuccessfully reproduces the observed frequency and distribution of giant\nplanets and brown dwarfs. The fit for super Earths is poorer for single-planet\nsystems, but improves steadily when more protoplanets are included.

We investigate whether these maps\nare contaminated by extragalactic signals using the clustering-redshift\ntechnique, i.e., by measuring a set of angular cross-correlations with\nspectroscopic objects as a function of redshift. Our tomographic analysis\nreveals imprints of extragalactic large-scale structure patterns in nine out of\n10 Galactic dust maps, including all infrared-based maps as well as \"stellar\"\nreddening maps. When such maps are used for extinction corrections, this\nextragalactic contamination introduces redshift- and scale-dependent biases in\nphotometric estimates at the millimagnitude level.

The bias can be appreciable when\nmeasuring angular correlation functions with low amplitudes, such as\nlensing-induced correlations or angular correlations for sources distributed\nover a broad redshift range. As expected, we do not detect any extragalactic\ncontamination for the dust map inferred from 21cm HI observations.

For example, if\nconsumer spending in the United States declines, it has spillover effects on\neconomies that depend on the U.S. as their largest export market. In this\npaper, we aim to infer the causation that results in spillover effects between\npairs of entities (or units), we call this effect as \\textit{paired spillover}.\nTo achieve this, we leverage the recent developments in variational inference\nand deep learning techniques to propose a generative model called Linked Causal\nVariational Autoencoder (LCVA). Similar to variational autoencoders (VAE), LCVA\nincorporates an encoder neural network to learn the latent attributes and a\ndecoder network to reconstruct the inputs. However, unlike VAE, LCVA treats the\n\\textit{latent attributes as confounders that are assumed to affect both the\ntreatment and the outcome of units}. Specifically, given a pair of units $u$\nand $\\bar{u}$, their individual treatment and outcomes, the encoder network of\nLCVA samples the confounders by conditioning on the observed covariates of $u$,\nthe treatments of both $u$ and $\\bar{u}$ and the outcome of $u$. Once inferred,\nthe latent attributes (or confounders) of $u$ captures the spillover effect of\n$\\bar{u}$ on $u$. Using a network of users from job training dataset (LaLonde\n(1986)) and co-purchase dataset from Amazon e-commerce domain, we show that\nLCVA is significantly more robust than existing methods in capturing spillover\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2018 20:11:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 00:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 03:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 17:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

The most widely used algorithm in UNDE systems is the\nsynthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) because it produces acceptable\nresults in real time. A few regularized inversion techniques with linear models\nhave been proposed which can improve on SAFT, but they tend to make simplifying\nassumptions that do not address how to obtain reconstructions from large real\ndata sets.

We suggest that languages compress\npercepts into words by optimizing the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff\nbetween the complexity and accuracy of their lexicons. We present empirical\nevidence that this principle may give rise to human-like semantic\nrepresentations, by exploring how human languages categorize colors.

Architectural constraints\non connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain;\nsystematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error\nfeedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the\nforward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be\nused in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment\nproblem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly\nsuccessful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks.\nBackpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron.\nFrom a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural\nconstraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain.\nThis architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback\nweights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity\npatterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal\nconnections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural\nconstraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error\nfeedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error\nfeedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer.

Each immune cell has a unique receptor for specific\nimmunological recognition. The binding affinity between the receptors and\nantigenic peptides mainly determines immunological recognition followed by\nsubsequent responses. Is the integrated binding affinity sufficient to probe\nthe digital information of peptide sequences? To answer this fundamental\nquestion, we examined whether the affinity-based discrimination of peptide\nsequences is learnable and generalizable by artificial neural networks (ANNs)\nthat process the digital information of receptors and peptides. We made use of\nlarge scale high-throughput data of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and open-source\npeptides amino acid sequences as the input layer data, and computationally\nexamined the success and failure of immune recognition based on the pairwise\nbinding energy of their amino acid sequences as output layer data. Machine\nlearning successfully captured the relevant information of molecular\ninteractions and discriminated between strong and weak affinity pairs. This\nsuggests the potential applicability of artificial neural networks to predict\nthe immune responsiveness of certain antigenic peptides once their sequence\ninformation is provided.

One and only mechanism proposed for prolonging the residence time of\nhot grains in the near-stellar environments is trapping of charged\nnanoparticles by stellar magnetic fields. We revisit the model of magnetic\ngrain trapping around main-sequence stars of various spectral classes by taking\ninto account sublimation and electric charging of the grains. The model of\nmagnetic grain trapping predicts that hot dust grains are present in the\nvicinity of main-sequence stars with high rotation velocities and intermediate\nmagnetic-field strengths. On the contrary, we find that the detection of hot\ndust grains has no correlation with the rotation velocities of central stars\nnor the magnetic field strengths of the stars. Our numerical evaluation of\nelectric grain charging indicates that the surface potential of\nsubmicrometer-sized grains in the vicinity of main-sequence stars is typically\n4-5 V, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the value assumed by the\nmodel of magnetic grain trapping. On the basis of our numerical simulation on\nsublimation of dust grains in the vicinity of a star, it turns out that their\nlives end due to sublimation in a timescale much shorter than the period of one\nrevolution at the gyroradius.

In\nthis work, taking the recently synthesised dimethylmethylene-bridged\ntriphenylamine (DTPA) sheet as an example, we investigate the mechanical\nbehaviours of 2D COFs based on molecular dynamics simulations together with\ndensity functional theory calculations. A novel phase transformation is\nobserved in DTPA sheets when a relatively large in-plane compressive strain is\napplied to them. Specifically, the crystal structures of the transformed phases\nare topographically different when the compressive loading is applied in\ndifferent directions. The compression-induced phase transformation in DTPA\nsheets is attributed to the buckling of their kagome lattice structures and is\nfound to have significant impacts on their material properties. After the phase\ntransformation, Young's modulus, band gap and thermal conductivity of DTPA\nsheets are greatly reduced and become strongly anisotropic. Moreover, a large\nin-plane negative Poisson's ratio is found in the transformed phases of DTPA\nsheets. It is expected that the results of the compression-induced phase\ntransformation and its influence on the material properties observed in the\npresent DTPA sheets can be further extended to other 2D COFs, since most 2D\nCOFs possess a similar kagome lattice structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 08:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

The spectra are convolved\nwith the response curves of the PACS and SPIRE bolometers and compared to the\nfluxes measured in imaging data of these sources.

The evolution of the loop's\ntransverse intensity profile from numerical simulations of kink oscillations is\nanalysed. Bayesian inference and forward modelling techniques are applied to\ninfer the evolution of the TDP from the intensity profiles, in a manner which\nmay be applied to observations. The strongest observational evidence for the\ndevelopment of the KHI is found to be a widening of the loop's inhomogeneous\nlayer, which may be inferred for sufficiently well resolved loops, i.e $>$ 15\ndata points across the loop. The main signatures when observing the core of the\nloop (for this specific loop model) during the oscillation are: a widening\ninhomogeneous layer, decreasing intensity, an unchanged radius, and visible\nfine transverse structuring when the resolution is sufficient. The appearance\nof these signatures are delayed for loops with wider inhomogeneous layers, and\nquicker for loops oscillating at higher amplitudes. These cases should also\nresult in stronger observational signatures, with visible transverse\nstructuring appearing for wide loops observed at SDO/AIA resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

Machine learning algorithm based wind speed forecasting models are\ngetting increased attention in the literature owing to its superior ability to\nlearn by effectively capturing the changing patterns from the data. Most of the\nreported wind forecasting models built on machine learning algorithms are\nlocation specific and tested against data adjacent to the training data. In\nthis work, we develop the machine learning based wind speed forecasting models\nand analyse their performance when applied to data from different cross-\nlocations up to a year ahead. Two distinct machine learning models based on\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms have been\ndeveloped and tested separately for a relatively large geographical area. The\nresults of analysis of 1-hour forecasts obtained at various cross-locations and\npoints of time up to a year ahead show 80% of predictions within a Root Mean\nSquare Error (RMSE) of 1.5 m/s, 95% within 2.5 m/s and 98% within an RMSEof 3.5\nm/s. The 75% of 2-hour predictions are within RMSE of 1.5 m/s, 16-hour\npredictions within RMSE of 2.5 m / s and 48-hour predictions within RMSE of 3.5\nm/s. When applied to thesame location of training data, the models generate\nreliable forecasts for periods up to 22 hours, with the added advantage that\nthe models perform consistently throughout the year ahead horizon, independent\nof the lead time from the training data. The output of the analysis is highly\npromising to the wind energy industry in wind forecasting for locations where\nhistorical wind speed data are not available for model building and training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

Exeum proposes a novel method to provide price stable digital\ntokens whose values are pegged to real world assets, serving as a bridge\nbetween the real world and the decentralized economy.\n  Pegged tokens issued by Exeum - for example, USDE refers to a stable token\nissued by the system whose value is pegged to USD - are backed by virtual\nassets in a virtual asset exchange where users can deposit the base token of\nthe system and take long or short positions. Guaranteeing the stability of the\npegged tokens boils down to the problem of maintaining the peg of the virtual\nassets to real world assets, and the main mechanism used by Exeum is\ncontrolling the swap rate of assets. If the swap rate is fully controlled by\nthe system, arbitrageurs can be incentivized enough to restore a broken peg;\nExeum distributes statistical arbitrage trading software to decentralize this\ntype of market making activity. The last major component of the system is a\ncentral bank equivalent that determines the long term interest rate of the base\ntoken, pays interest on the deposit by inflating the supply if necessary, and\nremoves the need for stability fees on pegged tokens, improving their\nusability.\n  To the best of our knowledge, Exeum is the first to propose a truly\ndecentralized method for developing a stablecoin that enables 1:1 value\nconversion between the base token and pegged assets, completely removing the\nmismatch between supply and demand. In this paper, we will also discuss its\napplications, such as improving staking based DApp token models, price stable\ngas fees, pegging to an index of DApp tokens, and performing cross-chain asset\ntransfer of legacy crypto assets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 10:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

This\napplies both to the case of supervised detection, where the known template is\nexpected to match in just a few areas and unsupervised anomaly detection, as\nanomalies are rare by definition. This problem is frequently related to the\nimaging applications, i.e. detection within the scene acquired by a camera. To\nmaximize available data about the scene, hyperspectral cameras are used; at\neach pixel, they record spectral data in hundreds of narrow bands.\n  The typical feature of hyperspectral imaging is that characteristic\nproperties of target materials are visible in the small number of bands, where\nlight of certain wavelength interacts with characteristic molecules. A\ntarget-independent band selection method based on statistical principles is a\nversatile tool for solving this problem in different practical applications.\n  Combination of a regular background and a rare standing out anomaly will\nproduce a distortion in the joint distribution of hyperspectral pixels.

Today, GPS is the de-facto outdoor localization system but has\nbeen shown to be vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. Inertial Navigation\nSystems (INS) are emerging as a popular complementary system, especially in\nroad transportation systems as they enable improved navigation and tracking as\nwell as offer resilience to wireless signals spoofing, and jamming attacks. In\nthis paper, we evaluate the security guarantees of INS-aided GPS tracking and\nnavigation for road transportation systems. We consider an adversary required\nto travel from a source location to a destination, and monitored by a INS-aided\nGPS system. The goal of the adversary is to travel to alternate locations\nwithout being detected. We developed and evaluated algorithms that achieve such\ngoal, providing the adversary significant latitude. Our algorithms build a\ngraph model for a given road network and enable us to derive potential\ndestinations an attacker can reach without raising alarms even with the\nINS-aided GPS tracking and navigation system. The algorithms render the\ngyroscope and accelerometer sensors useless as they generate road trajectories\nindistinguishable from plausible paths (both in terms of turn angles and roads\ncurvature). We also designed, built, and demonstrated that the magnetometer can\nbe actively spoofed using a combination of carefully controlled coils.

Our experiment reaches the most\ncomplete level of detail which previously has only been reached for single\nphoton double ionization. We give an overview over the observables on many\nlevels of integration, starting from the ratio of double to single ionization,\nthe individual electron and ion momentum distributions over joint momentum and\nenergy distributions to fully differential cross sections showing the\ncorrelated angular momentum distributions. Within the studied intensity range\nthe ratio of double to single ionization changes from $2\\times 10^{-4}$ to\n$1.5\\times 10^{-3}$. We find the momentum distributions of the $\\rm{He}^{2+}$\nions and the correlated two electron momentum distributions to vary\nsubstantially. Only at the highest intensity both electrons are emitted to the\nsame direction while at the lowest intensity back-to-back emission dominates.\nThe joint energy distribution of the electrons shows discrete structures from\nthe energy quantization of the photon field which allows us to count the number\nof absorbed photons and thus access the parity of the final state. We find the\nenergy of the individual electron to show a peak structure indicating a\nquantized sharing of the overall energy absorbed from the field. The joint\nangular momentum distributions of the two electrons show a highly directed\nemission of both electrons along the polarization axis as well as clear\nimprints of electron repulsion. They strongly change with the energy sharing\nbetween the electrons. The aspect of selection rules in double ionization which\nare also visible in the presented dataset has been subject to a preceding\npublication [1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 13:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

To develop more relevant tests for high-dimensional\ncases, we propose a portmanteau-type test statistic which is the sum of squared\nsingular values of the first $q$ lagged sample autocovariance matrices. It,\ntherefore, encapsulates all the serial correlations (upto the time lag $q$)\nwithin and across all component series.

Namely, let K denote the all scores matrix\ncontaining the alignment score of every substring of B with A, and let J denote\nthe all scores matrix containing the alignment score of every suffix of B with\nevery prefix of A.\n  In this paper we consider the problem of maintaining an all scores matrix\nwhere the scoring function is the LCS score, while supporting single character\nprepend and append operations to A and N. Our algorithms exploit the sparsity\nparameters L=LCS(A,B) and Delta = |B|-L. For the matrix K we propose an\nalgorithm that supports incremental operations to both ends of A in O(Delta)\ntime. Whilst for the matrix J we propose an algorithm that supports a single\ntype of incremental operation, either a prepend operation to A or an append\noperation to B, in O(L) time. This structure can also be extended to support\nboth operations simultaneously in O(L log log L) time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 14:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-13"}

One such systematic effect identified in the\nBSCv1 data is the issue of beam corrections. We determine these for the BSCv2\ndata by correlating ratios of appropriate IRAS and AKARI bands with the\ndifference in 2MASS J band extended and point source magnitudes for sources\ncross matched between the IRAS FSC, AKARI BSCv2 and 2MASS catalogs.

The addition of AKARI\nfluxes makes little difference to the results of simple (T,beta) fits to the\nSEDs of these sources, though there is a general decrease in reduced chi^2\nvalues. The utility of the extra AKARI data, however, is in allowing physically\nmore realistic SED models with more parameters to be fit to the data.

The non-linear nature of the processing makes\noptimizing the illumination pattern designs complicated. Traditional techniques\nfor experimental design (e.g. condition number optimization, spectral analysis)\nconsider only linear measurement formation models and linear reconstructions.\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) can efficiently represent the non-linear process\nand can be optimized over via training in an end-to-end framework. However,\nDNNs typically require a large amount of training examples and parameters to\nproperly learn the phase retrieval process, without making use of the known\nphysical models. Here, we aim to use both our knowledge of the physics and the\npower of machine learning together. We develop a new data-driven approach to\noptimizing coded-illumination patterns for a LED array microscope for a given\nphase reconstruction algorithm. Our method incorporates both the physics of the\nmeasurement scheme and the non-linearity of the reconstruction algorithm into\nthe design problem. This enables efficient parameterization, which allows us to\nuse only a small number of training examples to learn designs that generalize\nwell in the experimental setting without retraining.

Hopkins. Compared to\nearlier epochs 3C 120 is about a factor of three brighter, allowing us to study\nthe shape of the broad line region (BLR) and the dust torus in a high\nluminosity phase. The analysis of the light curves yields that the dust echo is\nrather sharp and symmetric in contrast to the more complex broad H alpha BLR\necho. We investigate how far this supports an optically thick bowl-shaped BLR\nand dust torus geometry as proposed by Kawaguchi & Mori (2010) and Goad et al.\n(2012). The comparison with several parameterizations of these models supports\nthe following geometry: the BLR clouds lie inside the bowl closely above the\nbowl rim, up to a half covering angle 0 deg < theta < 40 deg (measured against\nthe equatorial plane). Then the BLR is spread over many isodelay surfaces,\nyielding a smeared and structured echo as observed. Furthermore, if the BLR\nclouds shield the bottom of the bowl rim against radiation from the nucleus,\nthe hot dust emission comes essentially from the top edge of the bowl (40 deg <\ntheta < 45 deg). Then, for small inclinations as for 3C120, the top dust edge\nforms a ring which largely coincides with a narrow range of isodelay surfaces,\nyielding the observed sharp dust echo. The scale height of the BLR increases\nwith radial distance from the black hole. This leads to luminosity dependent\nforeshortening effects of the lag. We discuss implications and possible\ncorrections of the foreshortening for the black hole mass determination and\nconsequences for the lag (size) - luminosity relationships and the difference\nto interferometric torus sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 14:59:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 17:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

In various applications there is\nuncertainty on the system matrices J, R, Q, and it is desirable to know whether\nthe system remains asymptotically stable uniformly against all possible\nuncertainties within a given perturbation set. Such robust stability\nconsiderations motivate the concept of stability radius for DH systems, i.e.,\nwhat is the maximal perturbation permissible to the coefficients J, R, Q, while\npreserving the asymptotic stability.

Nonlinear parameter\nestimation in hierarchical models is known to be subject to overfitting and\nmisspecification. One approach to these estimation and related problems (local\nminima, colinearity, feature discovery etc.) is called Dropout (Hinton, et al\n2012, Baldi et al 2016). The Dropout algorithm removes hidden units according\nto a Bernoulli random variable with probability $p$ prior to each update,\ncreating random \"shocks\" to the network that are averaged over updates. In this\npaper we will show that Dropout is a special case of a more general model\npublished originally in 1990 called the Stochastic Delta Rule, or SDR (Hanson,\n1990). SDR redefines each weight in the network as a random variable with mean\n$\\mu_{w_{ij}}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{w_{ij}}$. Each weight random\nvariable is sampled on each forward activation, consequently creating an\nexponential number of potential networks with shared weights. Both parameters\nare updated according to prediction error, thus resulting in weight noise\ninjections that reflect a local history of prediction error and local model\naveraging. SDR therefore implements a more sensitive local gradient-dependent\nsimulated annealing per weight converging in the limit to a Bayes optimal\nnetwork. Tests on standard benchmarks (CIFAR) using a modified version of\nDenseNet shows the SDR outperforms standard Dropout in test error by approx.\n$17\\%$ with DenseNet-BC 250 on CIFAR-100 and approx. $12-14\\%$ in smaller\nnetworks.

It is an obvious\nquestion whether this solution can be built up iteratively by increasing the\nhorizon, i.e., by extending the classical backward dynamic programming solution\nfor the unconstrained case to the constrained case. Unfortunately, however, the\npiecewise affine solution for horizon N is in general not contained in the\npiecewise affine law for horizon N + 1. We show that a backward dynamic\nprogramming does, in contrast, result in a useful structure for the set of the\nactive sets that defines the solution. Essentially, every active set for the\nproblem with horizon N + 1 results from extending an active set for horizon N ,\nif the constraints are ordered stage by stage. Consequently, the set for\nhorizon N + 1 can be found by only considering the constraints of the\nadditional stage. Furthermore, it is easy to detect which polytopes and affine\npieces are invariant to increasing the horizon, and therefore persist in the\nlimit N to infinity. Several other aspects of the structure of the set of\nactive sets become evident if the active sets are represented by bit tuples.\nThere exists, for example, a subset of special active sets that generates a\npositive invariant and persistent (i.e., horizon invariant) set around the\norigin. It is very simple to identify these special active sets, and the\npositive invariant and persistent region can be found without solving optimal\ncontrol or auxiliary optimization problems.

Even when the possible interference on the different channels is\ndescribed by different conflict graphs, we show that the network dynamics can\nbe equivalently described as that of a single-channel CSMA algorithm on an\nappropriate virtual network. Our focus is on the asymptotic regime in which the\nnetwork nodes try to activate aggressively in order to achieve maximum\nthroughput. Of particular interest is the scenario where the number of\navailable channels is not sufficient for all nodes of the network to be\nsimultaneously active and the well-studied temporal starvation issues of the\nsingle-channel CSMA dynamics persist. For most networks we expect that a larger\nnumber of available channels should alleviate these temporal starvation issues.\nHowever, we prove that the aggregate throughput is a non-increasing function of\nthe number of available channels. To investigate this trade-off that emerges\nbetween aggregate throughput and temporal starvation phenomena, we propose an\nanalytical framework to study the transient dynamics of multi-channel CSMA\nnetworks by means of first hitting times.

Reasons for high prevalence of multi-domain proteins in\nvarious organisms have been attributed to higher stability and functional and\nfolding advantages over single-domain proteins. Despite these advantages, many\nproteins are composed of only one domain while their homologous domains are\npart of multi-domain proteins. In the study presented here, differences in the\nproperties of protein domains in single-domain and multi-domain systems and\ntheir influence on functions are discussed. We studied 20 pairs of identical\nprotein domains, which were crystallized in two forms (a) tethered to other\nproteins domains and (b) tethered to fewer protein domains than (a) or not\ntethered to any protein domain. Results suggest that tethering of domains in\nmulti-domain proteins influences the structural, dynamic and energetic\nproperties of the constituent protein domains. 50% of the protein domain pairs\nshow significant structural deviations while 90% of the protein domain pairs\nshow differences in dynamics and 12% of the residues show differences in the\nenergetics. To gain further insights on the influence of tethering on the\nfunction of the domains, 4 pairs of homologous protein domains, where one of\nthem is a full-length single-domain protein and the other protein domain is a\npart of a multi-domain protein, were studied. Analyses showed that identical\nand structurally equivalent functional residues show differential dynamics in\nhomologous protein domains, though comparable dynamics between in-silico\ngenerated chimera protein and multi-domain proteins were observed. From these\nobservations, the differences observed in the functions of homologous proteins\ncould be attributed to the presence of tethered domain. Overall, we conclude\nthat tethered domains in multi-domain proteins not only provide stability or\nfolding advantages but also influence pathways resulting in differences in\nfunction or regulatory properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 07:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

In this deep imaging process,\nwe incorporate deep convolutional neural network (CNN), residual learning, and\nnetwork in network techniques for feature extraction and restoration. In\ncontrast to the current trend of increasing network depth and complexity to\nboost the CT imaging performance, which limit its real-world applications by\nimposing considerable computational and memory overheads, we apply a parallel\n$1\\times1$ CNN to compress the output of the hidden layer and optimize the\nnumber of layers and the number of filters for each convolutional layer.\nQuantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed model is\naccurate, efficient and robust for super-resolution (SR) image restoration from\nnoisy LR input images. In particular, we validate our composite SR networks on\nthree large-scale CT datasets, and obtain promising results as compared to the\nother state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 05:33:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 17:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 20:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}
