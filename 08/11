It can help in understanding the dynamics of disease progression and\nfacilitate early diagnosis and prognosis. In this work we propose a novel\ndiscriminative approach to EBM, which is shown to be more accurate than\nexisting state-of-the-art EBM methods. The method first estimates for each\nsubject an approximate ordering of events. Subsequently, the central ordering\nover all subjects is estimated by fitting a generalized Mallows model to these\napproximate subject-specific orderings. We also introduce the concept of\nrelative distance between events which helps in creating a disease progression\ntimeline. Subsequently, we propose a method to stage subjects by placing them\non the estimated disease progression timeline.

Routine detections of gravitational-wave signals promote novel\nastrophysical and fundamental theory studies, while simultaneously leading to\nan increase in the number of detections temporally overlapping with\ninstrumentally- or environmentally-induced transients in the detectors\n(glitches), often of unknown origin. Indeed, this was the case for the very\nfirst detection by the LIGO and Virgo detectors of a gravitational-wave signal\nconsistent with a binary neutron star coalescence, GW170817. A loud glitch in\nthe LIGO-Livingston detector, about one second before the merger, hampered\ncoincident detection (which was initially achieved solely with LIGO-Hanford\ndata). Moreover, accurate source characterization depends on specific\nassumptions about the behavior of the detector noise that are rendered invalid\nby the presence of glitches. In this paper, we present the various techniques\nemployed for the initial mitigation of the glitch to perform source\ncharacterization of GW170817 and study advantages and disadvantages of each\nmitigation method. We show that, despite the presence of instrumental noise\ntransients louder than the one affecting GW170817, we are still able to produce\nunbiased measurements of the intrinsic parameters from simulated injections\nwith properties similar to GW170817.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 16:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 18:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

It is known that degradation may occur in convergence order if\nnon affine geometric mappings are used. On this point, we revisit a general\nprocedure for the improvement of two-dimensional flux approximations discussed\nin a recent paper of this journal (Comput. Math.

An example is $RT_{k}$\nspaces on quadrilateral meshes, where $r = k$ or $k-1$ if linear or bilinear\ngeometric isomorphisms are applied. Furthermore, the original space is required\nto be expressed by a factorization in terms of edge and internal shape flux\nfunctions.

We\nfind that the slope of the AVR is smaller for OCs than it is for field stars.\nUsing these AVRs, we constrained an age range of 0.01-1.87 Gyr for 'Oumuamua\nand characterized a most likely age ranging between 0.20-0.45 Gyr, depending on\nthe model used for the AVR. We also estimated the intrinsic uncertainties of\nthe method due to not knowing the exact value of the Solar motion and the\nparticularities of 1I/'Oumuamua's ejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 17:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

Peimbert (1967) proposed the presence of\n'temperature fluctuations' in these nebulae, but the apparent amplitude of such\nfluctuations, as deduced from spectral diagnostics and/or abundance discrepancy\nfactors, remain unexplained by standard photoionization modeling. While this\nand other alternative models to explain the temperature and abundance\ndiscrepancies remain inconclusive, recent observations seem to point at a\nconnection between nebular abundance discrepancy factors and a binary nature of\nphotoionizing stars. In this paper we show that large amplitude temperature\nfluctuations are expected to form in planetary nebulae photoionized by\nshort-period binary stars. Resonant temperature fluctuations are first formed\nalong the orbital disk around the binary stars, as the periodically varying\nionizing radiation field induces periodic oscillations in the\nheating-minus-cooling function. Then, the temperatures fluctuations propagate\nvertically to the disk as thermal waves that later steepen into radiative\nshocks. The binary period of the ionizing stars is determinant in the formation\nand propagation of temperature fluctuations, as well as in associated density\nfluctuations. Fluctuations propagate efficiently only in systems with binary\nperiods significantly shorter than the gas thermalization time, of the order of\n10 days.\n  Further, we propose temperature diagnostic line ratios that combine [O III]\ncollisionally excited lines and O II recombination lines to determine the\nequilibrium temperature and the magnitude of resonant temperature fluctuations\nin nebulae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 18:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Biological activity can be influenced by factors such as orientation\nand conformation. Hydrogels must promote the adsorption of biomolecules onto\nthe surface and the diffusion of biomolecules into the porous network at the\nsurface, while maintaining native protein conformation, keeping the protein in\nan accessible orientation for receptor binding, and maximizing protein release.\nWe report here the evaluation of (hydroxyethyl)methacrylate (HEMA)-based\nhydrogel systems for the delivery of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to\npromote re-epithelialization in wound healing. In this work, we characterize\ntwo hydrogel blends in addition to HEMA alone, and report how protein\norientation, conformation, and protein release is affected. The first blend\nincorporates methyl methacrylate (MMA), which is known to promote adsorption of\nprotein to its surface due to its hydrophobicity. The second blend incorporates\nmethacrylic acid (MAA), which is known to promote the diffusion of protein into\nits surface due to its hydrophilicity. We find that KGF at the surface of the\nHEMA/MMA blend appears to be more orientationally accessible and\nconformationally active than KGF at the surface of the HEMA/MAA blend. We also\nreport that KGF at the surface of the HEMA/MAA blend becomes conformationally\ndenatured, likely due to hydrogen bonding. While KGF at the surface of these\nblends can be differentiated by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy and ToF-SIMS in\nconjunction with PCA, KGF swelling, uptake, and release profiles are\nindistinguishable. The differences in KGF orientation and conformation between\nthese blends may result in different biological responses in future cell-based\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 19:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

The magnetic field above the\nintrusions possesses a spine-fan topology with a coronal null point. The\nmovement of magnetic flux by surface convection adds free energy to this field,\nforming current sheets and inducing reconnection. We conducted\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of moving magnetic elements\nas a model for coronal jets and bright points. A single minority-polarity\nconcentration was subjected to three different experiments: a large-scale\nsurface flow that sheared part of the separatrix surface only, a large-scale\nsurface flow that also sheared part of the polarity inversion line surrounding\nthe minority flux, and the latter flow setup plus a \"fly-by\" of a\nmajority-polarity concentration past the moving minority-polarity element.

Our approach\ncombines the idea of 'bin-sharing' with a deep convolutional neural network\n(CNN) model. More specifically, for each respiratory bin, an initial estimate\nof the patient sinogram is obtained by taking projections from adjacent bins\nand performing linear interpolation. Subsequently, the estimated sinogram is\npropagated through a CNN that predicts a full, high-quality sinogram. Lastly,\nthe predicted sinogram is reconstructed with traditional CBCT algorithms such\nas the Feldkamp, Davis and Kress (FDK) method. The CNN model, which we referred\nto as the Sino-Net, was trained under different loss functions. We assessed the\nperformance of the proposed method in terms of image quality metrics (mean\nsquare error, mean absolute error, peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural\nsimilarity) and tumor motion accuracy (tumor centroid deviation with respect to\nthe ground truth). Overall, the presented prototype model was able to\nsubstantially improve the quality of 4DCBCT images, removing most of the streak\nartifacts and decreasing the noise with respect to the standard FDK\nreconstructions. The tumor centroid deviations with respect to the ground truth\npredicted by our method were approximately 0.5 mm, on average (maximum\ndeviation was approximately 2 mm). These preliminary results are promising and\nencourage us to further investigate the performance of our model under more\nchallenging imaging conditions and compare it against the state-of-the-art CBCT\nreconstruction algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 20:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

However, except Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), most of existing topic models are seldom\napplied or considered in industrial scenarios. This phenomenon is caused by the\nfact that there are very few convenient tools to support these topic models so\nfar. Intimidated by the demanding expertise and labor of designing and\nimplementing parameter inference algorithms, software engineers are prone to\nsimply resort to PLSA/LDA, without considering whether it is proper for their\nproblem at hand or not. In this paper, we propose a configurable topic modeling\nframework named Familia, in order to bridge the huge gap between academic\nresearch fruits and current industrial practice. Familia supports an important\nline of topic models that are widely applicable in text engineering scenarios.\nIn order to relieve burdens of software engineers without knowledge of Bayesian\nnetworks, Familia is able to conduct automatic parameter inference for a\nvariety of topic models. Simply through changing the data organization of\nFamilia, software engineers are able to easily explore a broad spectrum of\nexisting topic models or even design their own topic models, and find the one\nthat best suits the problem at hand. With its superior extendability, Familia\nhas a novel sampling mechanism that strikes balance between effectiveness and\nefficiency of parameter inference. Furthermore, Familia is essentially a big\ntopic modeling framework that supports parallel parameter inference and\ndistributed parameter storage. The utilities and necessity of Familia are\ndemonstrated in real-life industrial applications.

Within such a\nsystem, an argumentation semantics is defined as a set of arguments with some\ndesired qualities, for example, that the elements are not in conflict with each\nother. Splitting an argumentation framework can efficiently speed up the\ncomputation of argumentation semantics. With respect to stable semantics, two\nmethods have been proposed to split an argumentation framework either in a\nunidirectional or bidirectional fashion. The advantage of bidirectional\nsplitting is that it is not structure-dependent and, unlike unidirectional\nsplitting, it can be used for frameworks consisting of a single strongly\nconnected component. Bidirectional splitting makes use of a minimum cut. In\nthis paper, we implement and test the performance of the bidirectional\nsplitting method, along with two types of graph cut algorithms. Experimental\ndata suggest that using a minimum cut will not improve the performance of\ncomputing stable semantics in most cases. Hence, instead of a minimum cut, we\npropose to use a balanced cut, where the framework is split into two\nsub-frameworks of equal size. Experimental results conducted on bidirectional\nsplitting using the balanced cut show a significant improvement in the\nperformance of computing semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 01:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

For both\ncampaigners and publishers, it is fundamentally critical to estimate the\ncontribution from ad campaign touch-points during the customer journey\n(conversion funnel) and assign the right credit to the right ad exposure\naccordingly. However, the existing research on the multi-touch attribution\nproblem lacks a principled way of utilizing the users' pre-conversion actions\n(i.e., clicks), and quite often fails to model the sequential patterns among\nthe touch points from a user's behavior data. To make it worse, the current\nindustry practice is merely employing a set of arbitrary rules as the\nattribution model, e.g., the popular last-touch model assigns 100% credit to\nthe final touch-point regardless of actual attributions. In this paper, we\npropose a Dual-attention Recurrent Neural Network (DARNN) for the multi-touch\nattribution problem. It learns the attribution values through an attention\nmechanism directly from the conversion estimation objective. To achieve this,\nwe utilize sequence-to-sequence prediction for user clicks, and combine both\npost-view and post-click attribution patterns together for the final conversion\nestimation. To quantitatively benchmark attribution models, we also propose a\nnovel yet practical attribution evaluation scheme through the proxy of budget\nallocation (under the estimated attributions) over ad channels. The\nexperimental results on two real datasets demonstrate the significant\nperformance gains of our attribution model against the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 01:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 01:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

We investigate the dependence of quasi-normal frequencies\non the mass of scalar field as well as other parameters of the wormhole. It is\nfound that the perturbations are always stable for the wormhole geometry which\nhas the general relativity (GR) limit when the scalar field mass m satisfies a\ncertain, tachyonic mass bound m^2 > m^2_* with m^2_* < 0, analogous to the\nBreitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound in the global-AdS space, m^2_BF = 3 Lambda/4.\nIt is also found that the BF-like bound m^2_* shifts by the changes of the\ncosmological constant Lambda or angular-momentum number l, with a level\ncrossing between the lowest complex and pure-imaginary modes for zero angular\nmomentum l = 0. Furthermore, it is found that the unstable modes can also have\noscillatory parts as well as non-oscillatory parts depending on whether the\nreal and imaginary parts of frequencies are dependent on each other or not,\ncontrary to arguments in the literature.

The routing scheme ensures only certain capsules which\nresemble lower counterparts in the higher layer should be activated. However,\nthe computational complexity becomes a bottleneck for scaling up to larger\nnetworks, as lower capsules need to correspond to each and every higher\ncapsule. To resolve this limitation, we approximate the routing process with\ntwo branches: a master branch which collects primary information from its\ndirect contact in the lower layer and an aide branch that replenishes master\nbased on pattern variants encoded in other lower capsules. Compared with\nprevious iterative and unsupervised routing scheme, these two branches are\ncommunicated in a fast, supervised and one-time pass fashion. The complexity\nand runtime of the model are therefore decreased by a large margin. Motivated\nby the routing to make higher capsule have agreement with lower capsule, we\nextend the mechanism as a compensation for the rapid loss of information in\nnearby layers. We devise a feedback agreement unit to send back higher capsules\nas feedback. It could be regarded as an additional regularization to the\nnetwork. The feedback agreement is achieved by comparing the optimal transport\ndivergence between two distributions (lower and higher capsules). Such an\nadd-on witnesses a unanimous gain in both capsule and vanilla networks.

In the AC magnetometry based on decoupling sequences, the maximum phase\naccumulation of the NV spin due to an AC field can be generally obtained when\nthe $\\pi$-pulse period in the sequences matches the half time period of the\nfield and the relative phase difference between the sequences and the field is\nzero. By contrast, the NV quantum sensor acquires no phase accumulation if the\nrelative phase difference is $\\pi/2$. Thus, this phase-accumulation condition\ndoes not have any advantage for the magnetometry. However, we revealed that the\nnon-phase-accumulation condition is available for detecting a very small phase\nshift of an AC field from its initial phase. This finding is expected to\nprovide a guide for realizing sensitive measurement of a complex AC magnetic\nfield in micrometer and nanometer scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 10:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

A three-dimensional semi-implicit finite difference and\nfinite volume model is derived so that numerical stability is obtained at a low\ncomputational cost on a staggered grid.

However, the traditional stochastic particle BGK method\ndecouples the molecular motions and collisions in analogy to the DSMC method,\nand hence its transport properties deviate from physical values as the time\nstep increases.

We derive formulae to calculate\nthe impact of LGS light on the camera of a neighbouring telescope and the\nprobabilities for a laser crossing the camera field-of-view to occur, and apply\nthese to the specific case of the next very-high-energy gamma-ray observatory\n\"Cherenkov Telescope Array\" (CTA). Its southern part shall be constructed in a\nvalley of the Cerro Armazones, Chile, close to the \"Very Large Telescope\" (VLT)\nand the \"European Extremely Large Telescope\" (ELT), while its northern part\nwill be located at the \"Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos\", on the Canary\nIsland of La Palma, which also hosts the \"Gran Telescopio de Canarias\" (GTC)\nand serves as an optional site for the \"Thirty Meter Telescope\" (TMT), both\nemploying LGS systems. Although finding the artificial star in the\nfield-of-view of a CTA telescope will not disturb observations considerably,\nthe laser beam crossing the field-of-view of a CTA telescope may be critical.\nWe find no conflict expected for the ELT lasers, however, 1% (3%) of\nextra-galactic and 1% (5%) of galactic observations with the CTA may be\naffected by the GTC (TMT) LGS lasers, unless an enhanced version of a laser\ntracking control system gets implemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 15:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

However, realizing\nhigh-fidelity nonreciprocity in low-loss integrated photonic systems remains\nchallenging. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a device concept\nbased on nonlocal acousto-optic light scattering to produce nonreciprocal\nsingle-sideband modulation and mode conversion in an integrated silicon\nphotonic platform. In this process, a traveling-wave acoustic phonon driven via\noptical forces in a silicon waveguide is used to modulate light in a spatially\nseparate waveguide through a linear inter-band Brillouin scattering process. We\ndemonstrate up to 38 dB of nonreciprocity with 37 dB of single-sideband\nsuppression. In contrast to prior Brillouin- and optomechanics-based schemes\nfor nonreciprocity, the bandwidth of this scattering process is set through\noptical phase-matching, not acoustic or optical resonances. As a result,\nrecord-large bandwidths in excess of 125 GHz are realized, with potential for\nsignificant further improvement through optical dispersion engineering.\nTunability of the nonreciprocal modulator operation wavelength over a 35 nm\nbandwidth is demonstrated by varying the optical pump wavelength. Such\ntraveling-wave acousto-optic modulators provide a promising path toward the\nrealization of broadband, low-loss isolators and circulators in integrated\nphotonic circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 19:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

The cost structure for flows in the FCNF\ninvolves both fixed and variable costs. The FCNF problem is modeled mixed\nbinary linear programs and can be solved with standard commercial solvers,\nwhich use branch and bound algorithm. This problem is important for its widely\napplications and solving challenges. There does not exist a efficient algorithm\nto solve this problem optimally due to lacking tight bounds. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work that employs statistical learning technique\nto analyze the optimal flow of the FCNF problem. Most algorithms developed to\nsolve the FCNF problem are based on the cost structure, relaxation, etc. We\nstart from the network characteristics and explore the relationship between\nproperties of nodes, arcs and networks and the optimal flow. This is a\nbi-direction approach and the findings can be used to locate the features that\naffect the optimal flow most significantly, predict the optimal arcs and\nprovide information to solve the FCNF problem. In particular, we define 33\nfeatures based on the network characteristics, from which using step wise\nregression, we identify 26 statistical significant predictors for logistic\nregression to predict which arcs will have positive flow in the optimal\nsolutions. The predictive model achieves 88% accuracy and the area under\nreceiver operating characteristic curve is 0.95. Two applications are\ninvestigated. Firstly, the predictive results can be used directly as component\ncritical index. The failure of arcs with higher critical index result in more\ncost increase over the entire network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 05:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}
