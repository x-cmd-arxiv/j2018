Projections with low discriminative ability can adversely influence\nthe final 3D shape representation. Especially under the real situations with\nbackground clutter and object occlusion, the adverse effect is even more\nsevere. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel deep neural network, View\nDiscerning Network, which learns to judge the quality of views and adjust their\ncontributions to the representation of shapes. In this network, a Score\nGeneration Unit is devised to evaluate the quality of each projected image with\nscore vectors. These score vectors are used to weight the image features and\nthe weighted features perform much better than original features in 3D shape\nrecognition task. In particular, we introduce two structures of Score\nGeneration Unit, Channel-wise Score Unit and Part-wise Score Unit, to assess\nthe quality of feature maps from different perspectives. Our network aggregates\nfeatures and scores in an end-to-end framework, so that final shape descriptors\nare directly obtained from its output. Our experiments on ModelNet and ShapeNet\nCore55 show that View Discerning Network outperforms the state-of-the-arts in\nterms of the retrieval task, with excellent robustness against background\nclutter and object occlusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 16:09:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 21:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

This progress has been brought about by improvements in\nmethods for evaluating interatomic forces that work by either solving the\nelectronic structure problem explicitly, or by computing accurate\napproximations of the solution and by the development of techniques that use\nthe Born-Oppenheimer (BO) forces to move the atoms on the BO potential energy\nsurface. As a consequence of these developments it is now possible to identify\nstable or metastable states, to sample configurations consistent with the\nappropriate thermodynamic ensemble, and to estimate the kinetics of reactions\nand phase transitions. All too often, however, progress is slowed down by the\nbottleneck associated with implementing new optimization algorithms and/or\nsampling techniques into the many existing electronic-structure and\nempirical-potential codes. To address this problem, we are thus releasing a new\nversion of the i-PI software. This piece of software is an easily extensible\nframework for implementing advanced atomistic simulation techniques using\ninteratomic potentials and forces calculated by an external driver code. While\nthe original version of the code was developed with a focus on path integral\nmolecular dynamics techniques, this second release of i-PI not only includes\nseveral new advanced path integral methods, but also offers other classes of\nalgorithms. In other words, i-PI is moving towards becoming a universal force\nengine that is both modular and tightly coupled to the driver codes that\nevaluate the potential energy surface and its derivatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 16:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 08:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

In this article I explore the different ways academic\nmathematicians are called to provide emotional labor in the discipline, thereby\nilluminating a rarely visible component of a mathematical life in the academy.\nUnderlying this work is my contention that a conceptualization of labor\ninvolved in managing emotions is of value to the project of understanding the\ncharacter, values, and boundaries of such a life. In order to investigate the\nvarious dimensions of emotional labor in the context of academic mathematics, I\nextend the basic framework of Morris and Feldman [33] and then apply this\nextended framework to the mathematical sciences. Other researchers have mainly\nfocused on the negative effects of emotional labor on a laborer's physical,\nemotional, and mental health, and several examples in this article align with\nthis framing. However, at the end of the article, I argue that mathematical\ncommunities and mentoring structures such as EDGE help diminish some of the\nnegative aspects of emotional labor while also accentuating the positives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 17:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 18:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

As a first\nstep toward reducing the performance gap between decentralized and centralized\nmethods, we present a multi-scenario multi-stage training framework to learn an\noptimal policy. The policy is trained over a large number of robots in rich,\ncomplex environments simultaneously using a policy gradient based reinforcement\nlearning algorithm. The learning algorithm is also integrated into a hybrid\ncontrol framework to further improve the policy's robustness and effectiveness.\n  We validate the learned sensor-level collision avoidance policy in a variety\nof simulated and real-world scenarios with thorough performance evaluations for\nlarge-scale multi-robot systems. The generalization of the learned policy is\nverified in a set of unseen scenarios including the navigation of a group of\nheterogeneous robots and a large-scale scenario with 100 robots. Although the\npolicy is trained using simulation data only, we have successfully deployed it\non physical robots with shapes and dynamics characteristics that are different\nfrom the simulated agents, in order to demonstrate the controller's robustness\nagainst the sim-to-real modeling error.

Although qualitative\nunderstanding that this transfer involves nonlinear destabilization of the\nroll-streak coherent structure has been established, identification of this\ninstability has resisted analysis.

For binocular disparity, on the other hand, the\nterms 'horizontal' and 'vertical' disparities are commonly used. This is odd,\nsince binocular disparity and optic flow describe essentially the same thing.\nThe difference is that, generally, people tend to fixate relatively close to\nthe direction of heading as they move, meaning that fixation is close to the\noptic flow epipole, whereas, for binocular vision, fixation is close to the\nhead-centric midline, i.e. approximately 90 degrees from the binocular epipole.\nFor fixating animals, some separations of flow may lead to simple algorithms\nfor the judgement of surface structure and the control of action. We consider\nthe following canonical flow patterns that sum to produce overall flow: (i)\n'towards' flow, the component of translational flow produced by approaching (or\nretreating from) the fixated object, which produces pure radial flow on the\nretina; (ii) 'sideways' flow, the remaining component of translational flow,\nwhich is produced by translation of the optic centre orthogonal to the\ncyclopean line of sight and (iii) 'vergence' flow, rotational flow produced by\na counter-rotation of the eye in order to maintain fixation. A general flow\npattern could also include (iv) 'cyclovergence' flow, produced by rotation of\none eye relative to the other about the line of sight. We consider some\npractical advantages of dividing up flow in this way when an observer fixates\nas they move. As in some previous treatments, we suggest that there are certain\ntasks for which it is sensible to consider 'towards' flow as one component and\n'sideways' + 'vergence' flow as another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 22:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

A convenient approach to study parallelization is through the\nprism of \\emph{adaptivity} which is an information theoretic measure of the\nparallel runtime of an algorithm [BS18]. Informally, adaptivity is the number\nof sequential rounds an algorithm needs to make when it can execute\npolynomially-many queries in parallel at every round. For combinatorial\noptimization with black-box oracle access, the study of adaptivity has recently\nled to exponential accelerations in parallel runtime and the natural question\nis whether dramatic accelerations are achievable for convex optimization.\n  For the problem of minimizing a non-smooth convex function $f:[0,1]^n\\to\n\\mathbb{R}$ over the unit Euclidean ball, we give a tight lower bound that\nshows that even when $\\texttt{poly}(n)$ queries can be executed in parallel,\nthere is no randomized algorithm with $\\tilde{o}(n^{1/3})$ rounds of adaptivity\nthat has convergence rate that is better than those achievable with a\none-query-per-round algorithm.

To this end, many\nrecommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as\nthe Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). Using matrix Factorization (MF) ---\nthe most widely used model in recommendation --- as a demonstration, we show\nthat optimizing it with BPR leads to a recommender model that is not robust. In\nparticular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to\nadversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly\nlarge error in generalization.\n  To enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its\ngeneralization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely\nAdversarial Personalized Ranking (APR). In short, our APR enhances the pairwise\nranking method BPR by performing adversarial training. It can be interpreted as\nplaying a minimax game, where the minimization of the BPR objective function\nmeanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model\nparameters to maximize the BPR objective function. To illustrate how it works,\nwe implement APR on MF by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding\nvectors of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of APR --- by optimizing MF with APR, it\noutperforms BPR with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for item recommendation.

Not only the double peaks but also multiple peaks and spikes\nare often observed in any phase of the cycle. We propose that these peaks and\nspikes are generated due to fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process (the\npoloidal field generation from tilted bipolar magnetic regions). When the polar\nfield develops, large negative fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process can\nreduce the net polar field abruptly. As these fluctuations in the polar field\nare propagated to the new toroidal field, these can promote double peaks in the\nnext solar cycle. When fluctuations in the polar field occur outside the solar\nmaximum, we observe their effects as spikes or dips in the following sunspot\ncycle. Using an axisymmetric Babcock-Leighton dynamo model we first demonstrate\nthis idea. Later, we perform a long simulation by including random scatter in\nthe poloidal field generation process and successfully reproduce the\ndouble-peaked solar cycles. These results are robust under reasonable changes\nin the model parameters as long as the diffusivity is not too larger than\n$10^{12}$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$. Finally, we analyze the observed polar field data to\nshow a close connection between the short-term fluctuations in the polar field\nand the double peaks/spikes in the next cycle. Thereby, this supports our\ntheoretical idea that the fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton process can be\nresponsible for the double peaks/spikes in the observed solar cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2018 10:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

In this paper, a\nmulti-color blackbody (mBB) model is proposed for the time-integrated spectrum\nof GRB 081221 by assuming a power-law distribution of the thermal luminosities\nwith temperature, which manifests photospheric emissions from a different\nradius and/or angle.

After the measurements were band-passed, they\nwere split into two parts (of comparable sizes), one yielding the training\n(learning) set (i.e., the database of embedding vectors and associated\npredictions), the other the test set. The optimal embedding dimension $m_0=10$\nwas obtained using Cao's method; this result was confirmed by an analysis of\nthe correlation dimension. Subsequently, the extraction of the maximal Lyapunov\nexponent $\\lambda$ was pursued for embedding dimensions $m$ between $3$ and\n$12$; results were obtained after removing the prominent undulations of the\nout-of-sample prediction-error arrays $S (k)$ by fitting a monotonic function\nto the data. The grand mean of the values, obtained for sufficient embedding\ndimensions ($10 \\leq m \\leq 12$), was: $\\lambda = (9.2 \\pm 1.0 ({\\rm stat.})\n\\pm 2.7 ({\\rm syst.})) \\cdot 10^{-2}~\\Delta \\tau^{-1}$, where $\\Delta \\tau=10$\ns is the sampling interval in the measurements.

It is a significant technical\nchallenge since humans display their emotions through complex idiosyncratic\ncombinations of the language, visual and acoustic modalities. In contrast to\ntraditional multimodal fusion techniques, we approach emotion recognition from\nboth direct person-independent and relative person-dependent perspectives. The\ndirect person-independent perspective follows the conventional emotion\nrecognition approach which directly infers absolute emotion labels from\nobserved multimodal features. The relative person-dependent perspective\napproaches emotion recognition in a relative manner by comparing partial video\nsegments to determine if there was an increase or decrease in emotional\nintensity. Our proposed model integrates these direct and relative prediction\nperspectives by dividing the emotion recognition task into three easier\nsubtasks. The first subtask involves a multimodal local ranking of relative\nemotion intensities between two short segments of a video. The second subtask\nuses local rankings to infer global relative emotion ranks with a Bayesian\nranking algorithm. The third subtask incorporates both direct predictions from\nobserved multimodal behaviors and relative emotion ranks from local-global\nrankings for final emotion prediction. Our approach displays excellent\nperformance on an audio-visual emotion recognition benchmark and improves over\nother algorithms for multimodal fusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2018 09:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}

The presence of these cracks could severely\ncompromise the shaft resonance frequencies. Dynamic response of shafts with\nlongitudinal and circumferential cracks is investigated. The longitudinal\ncracked section of the shaft section is modeled as a shaft with reduced\ntorsional rigidity. The torsional rigidity is obtained as a function of the\ncrack depth. It was found for various shaft diameters, torsional rigidity could\nbe represented as a function of crack depth/ shaft radius only. The\ncircumferential cracked section is modeled as a torsional spring. The torsional\nspring constant has been obtained using fracture mechanics. It was found the\nresonance frequency of the shaft may be little affected by the presence of\nlongitudinal crack. The resonance frequencies of the shaft with the\ncircumferential crack depend on the crack length and location.
