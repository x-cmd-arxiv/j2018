In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the\nautomatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters\nrequires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the\nnumber of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic\ngraphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here,\nwe address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional\nlayer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes\nfor each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into\ngrid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular\nconvolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on\nlarge-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the\nexcessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior\nmethods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification\ntasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our\nmethods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer,\nPubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets.

Unlike traditional robots that\nwork in structured and deterministic environments, co-robots need to operate in\nhighly unstructured and stochastic environments. To ensure that co-robots\noperate efficiently and safely in dynamic uncertain environments, this paper\nintroduces the robot safe interaction system. In order to address the\nuncertainties during human-robot interactions, a unique parallel planning and\ncontrol architecture is proposed, which has a long term global planner to\nensure efficiency of robot behavior, and a short term local planner to ensure\nreal time safety under uncertainties. In order for the robot to respond\nimmediately to environmental changes, fast algorithms are used for real-time\ncomputation, i.e., the convex feasible set algorithm for the long term\noptimization, and the safe set algorithm for the short term optimization.\nSeveral test platforms are introduced for safe evaluation of the developed\nsystem in the early phase of deployment. The effectiveness and the efficiency\nof the proposed method have been verified in experiment with an industrial\nrobot manipulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2018 18:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

Though static pricing is dominant in the actual data market, price\nintuitively ought to be dynamically changed to yield greater revenue. The\ncritical question is how to design the optimal dynamic pricing scheme, with\nprospects for maximizing the expected long-term revenue. In this paper, we\nstudy the sequential dynamic pricing scheme of a monopoly mobile network\noperator in the social data market. In the market, the operator, i.e., the\nseller, individually offers each mobile user, i.e., the buyer, a certain price\nin multiple time periods dynamically and repeatedly. The proposed scheme\nexploits the network effects in the mobile users' behaviors that boost the\nsocial data demand. Furthermore, due to limited radio resource, the impact of\nwireless network congestion is taken into account in the pricing scheme.\nThereafter, we propose a modified sequential pricing policy in order to ensure\nsocial fairness among mobile users in terms of their individual utilities. We\nanalytically demonstrate that the proposed sequential dynamic pricing scheme\ncan help the operator gain greater revenue and mobile users achieve higher\ntotal utilities than those of the baseline static pricing scheme. To gain more\ninsights, we further study a simultaneous dynamic pricing scheme in which the\noperator determines the pricing strategy at the beginning of each time period.\nMobile users decide on their individual data demand in each time period\nsimultaneously, considering the network effects in the social domain and the\ncongestion effects in the network domain. We construct the social graph using\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi (ER) model and the real dataset based social network for\nperformance evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 01:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

Since this $p_z^*$ state originates\nnot from interactions between the atoms but from the unpaired $p_z$ orbitals\ndue to the removal of $p_z$ orbitals on the minority sublattice, the $p_z^*$\nstate is constrained, distributed on the atoms of the majority sublattice, and\ndecays gradually from the vacancy as $\\sim$ $1/r$. According to these\ncharacteristics, we concluded that the $p_z^*$ state plays a critical role in\nmagnetic ordering in graphene with vacancies. If the vacancy concentration in\ngraphene is large enough to cause the decay-length regions to overlap,\nconstraining the $p_z^*$ orbital components as little as possible on the\nminority sublattice atoms in the overlap regions results in the vacancy-induced\n$p_z^*$ states being coherent. The coherent process in the overlap region leads\nto the wavefunctions in all the involved regions antisymmetrized, consequently\ncausing ferromagnetism according to the electron exchange antisymmetric\nprinciple. This unusual mechanism concerned with the origin of $sp$-electron\nmagnetism and magnetic ordering has never before been reported and is\ndistinctly different from conventional mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 03:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

To realize that experimentally,\nthe array of amplifying microdroplets is created using a vibrating orifice\ndroplet generator.

Until\nrecently, the consensus was that, in this limit, flows are in a marginal state\nwhere only a minimal level of turbulence activity persists. Observations in\ndirect numerical simulations using minimal sized channels appeared to support\nthis view and reported long \"hibernation\" periods where turbulence is\nmarginalized. In simulations of pipe flow we find that, indeed, with increasing\nWeissenberg number (Wi), turbulence expresses long periods of hibernation if\nthe domain size is small. However, with increasing pipe length, the temporal\nhibernation continuously alters to spatio-temporal intermittency and here the\nflow consists of turbulent puffs surrounded by laminar flow. Moreover, upon an\nincrease in Wi, the flow fully relaminarises, in agreement with recent\nexperiments. At even larger Wi, a different instability is encountered causing\na drag increase towards MDR. Our findings hence link earlier minimal flow unit\nsimulations with recent experiments and confirm that the addition of polymers\ninitially suppresses Newtonian turbulence and leads to a reverse transition.\nThe MDR state on the other hand results from a separate instability and the\nunderlying dynamics corresponds to the recently proposed state of\nelasto-inertial-turbulence (EIT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 06:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Here we report on such a scenario, in which the abrasive\ndeposition of trace amounts of materials onto a diamond gives rise to a\npreviously unreported source of magnetic noise.

Towards\ninvestigating the non-trivial electrohydrodynamics of a compound droplet,\nconfined in between two parallel plate electrodes, a phase field approach has\nbeen adopted. Under the assumption of negligible fluid inertia and small shape\ndeformation, an asymptotic model is also developed to predict the transient as\nwell as the steady state droplet dynamics in the limiting case of an unbounded\nsuspending medium. The phases involved are either assumed to be perfect\ndielectric or leaky dielectric. Subsequent investigation shows that shape\ndeformation of either of the interfaces of the droplet increase with rise in\nthe channel confinement for a perfect dielectric system. However, for a leaky\ndielectric system, the deformation of inner droplet and outer droplet can\nincrease or decrease with the rise in channel confinement depending on the\nelectric properties (conductivity and permittivity) of the system. The present\nstudy further takes into account the effect of eccentricity of the inner\ndroplet. Depending on the relative magnitude of the permittivity and\nconductivity of the system, the inner droplet, if eccentrically located, may\nexhibit a to and fro or a simple translational motion. It is seen that increase\nin the channel confinement results in a translational motion of the inner\ndroplet thus rendering its motion independent of any electrical properties.\nSince the compound droplet model approximately mimics the structure of a cell,\nthe current investigation is expected to provide a significant impact towards\npredicting the effect of an externally imposed electrical field on the dynamics\nof a cell in any fluidic confinement and hence has the potential towards\nwidespread applications in the field of medical diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 08:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

Chinese characters are\nmainly logographic and consist of basic radicals, however, previous research\nmostly treated each Chinese character as a whole without explicitly considering\nits internal two-dimensional structure and radicals. In this study, we propose\na novel radical analysis network with densely connected architecture (DenseRAN)\nto analyze Chinese character radicals and its two-dimensional structures\nsimultaneously. DenseRAN first encodes input image to high-level visual\nfeatures by employing DenseNet as an encoder. Then a decoder based on recurrent\nneural networks is employed, aiming at generating captions of Chinese\ncharacters by detecting radicals and two-dimensional structures through\nattention mechanism. The manner of treating a Chinese character as a\ncomposition of two-dimensional structures and radicals can reduce the size of\nvocabulary and enable DenseRAN to possess the capability of recognizing unseen\nChinese character classes, only if the corresponding radicals have been seen in\ntraining set.

We apply our results to\nstrengthen and generalize real-rootedness, unimodality, and alternatingly\nincreasing results pertaining to colored Eulerian and derangement polynomials,\nEhrhart $h^\\ast$-polynomials for lattice zonotopes, $h$-polynomials of\nbarycentric subdivisions of doubly Cohen-Macaulay level simplicial complexes,\nand certain local $h$-polynomials for subdivisions of simplices.

A related, applied research strand has studied\nmethods by which certain iterative task-based algorithms can be efficiently\nparallelized via relaxed concurrent priority schedulers. These allow for high\nconcurrency when inserting and removing tasks, at the cost of executing\nsuperfluous work due to the relaxed semantics of the scheduler.\n  In this work, we take a step towards unifying these two research directions,\nby showing that there exists a family of relaxed priority schedulers that can\nefficiently and deterministically execute classic iterative algorithms such as\ngreedy maximal independent set (MIS) and matching. Our primary result shows\nthat, given a randomized scheduler with an expected relaxation factor of $k$ in\nterms of the maximum allowed priority inversions on a task, and any graph on\n$n$ vertices, the scheduler is able to execute greedy MIS with only an additive\nfactor of poly($k$) expected additional iterations compared to an exact (but\nnot scalable) scheduler. This counter-intuitive result demonstrates that the\noverhead of relaxation when computing MIS is not dependent on the input size or\nstructure of the input graph. Experimental results show that this overhead can\nbe clearly offset by the gain in performance due to the highly scalable\nscheduler. In sum, we present an efficient method to deterministically\nparallelize iterative sequential algorithms, with provable runtime guarantees\nin terms of the number of executed tasks to completion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 11:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

The approach takes into account interactions of electrons with spin\nand charge fluctuations of all ranges and fulfils the Mermin-Wagner theorem.\nTemperature and concentration dependencies of the uniform magnetic\nsusceptibility, the variation of the double occupancy with the repulsion and\nthe temperature dependence of the square of the site spin are in satisfactory\nagreement with Monte Carlo results. Three types of the temperature variation of\nthe electron energy spectrum can be distinguished at half-filling. For\n$U\\lesssim 3t$, at low temperatures, there are two nonintersecting bands, which\napproach each other on the boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone. With\nincreasing $T$ these bands merge into one band crossing the Fermi level. For\n$4t\\lesssim U \\lesssim 6t$, the low-temperature picture described above is\nsupplemented with a low-intensity spin-polaron band located near the Fermi\nlevel. As its counterpart in the strong-correlation case, the band is formed by\nbound states of electrons and spin excitations. However, in contrast to the\nformer case, the band exists even at half-filling and occupies the entire\nBrillouin zone. As for lower $U$, with increasing temperature, all bands\ncoalesce into a single band. For $U\\gtrsim 7t$ and low temperatures the\nspectrum has a pronounced four-band structure, which with increasing $T$\ntransforms into two Hubbard subbands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 12:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 05:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

One of the interesting phenomena driven\nby such heterogeneities is the friendship paradox (FP), stating that the mean\ndegree of one's neighbors is larger than the degree of oneself. Alternatively,\none can use the median degree of neighbors as well as the fraction of neighbors\nhaving a higher degree than oneself. Each of these reflects on how people\nperceive their neighborhoods, i.e., their perception models, hence how they\nfeel peer pressure. In our paper, we study the impact of perception models on\nthe FP by comparing three versions of the perception model in networks\ngenerated with a given degree distribution and a tunable degree-degree\ncorrelation or assortativity. The increasing assortativity is expected to\ndecrease network-level peer pressure, while we find a nontrivial behavior only\nfor the mean-based perception model. By simulating opinion formation, in which\nthe opinion adoption probability of an individual is given as a function of\nindividual peer pressure, we find that it takes the longest time to reach\nconsensus when individuals adopt the median-based perception model, compared to\nother versions. Our findings suggest that one needs to consider the proper\nperception model for better modeling human behaviors and social dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 12:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 02:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

A field theoretical model - called extended\nhigher-abelian Maxwell theory - is introduced, which is a higher-abelian\nversion of Maxwell theory of electromagnetism extended by a particular\ntopological action.

In multi-planet systems that host giant planets, the perturbation of\nthe protoplanetary disk strongly affects the migration of companion planets. By\nstudying the well-characterized resonant planetary system around GJ 876 we aim\nto explore which effects shape disk-driven migration in such a multi-planet\nsystem to form resonant chains. We modelled the orbital migration of three\nplanets embedded in a protoplanetary disk using two-dimensional locally\nisothermal hydrodynamical simulations. We performed a parameter study by\nvarying the disk thickness, $\\alpha$ viscosity, mass as well as the initial\nposition of the planets. Moreover, we have analysed and compared simulations\nwith various boundary conditions at the disk's inner rim. We find that due to\nthe high masses of the giant planets, substantial eccentricity can be excited\nin the disk. This results in large variations of the torque acting on the outer\nlower-mass planet, which we attribute to a shift of Lindblad and corotation\nresonances due to disk eccentricity. Depending on disk parameters, the\nmigration of the outer planet can be stopped in a non-resonant state. In other\nmodels, the outer planet is able to open a partial gap and to circularize the\ndisk again, later entering a 2:1 resonance with the most massive planet in the\nsystem to complete the observed Laplace resonance. Disk-mediated interactions\nbetween planets due to spiral waves and excitation of disk eccentricity cause\ndeviations from smooth inward migration of exterior lower mass planets.\nSelf-consistent modelling of the disk-driven migration of multi-planet systems\nis thus mandatory. Our results are compatible with a late migration of the\noutermost planet into the resonant chain, when the giant planet pair already is\nin resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 13:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

We prove that the\ncircle centers under Miquel dynamics are Clifford lattices, considered as an\nintegrable system by Konopelchenko and Schief.

However, they suffer from poor reliability of interconnects\nand devices. Interconnects on flex are prone to open circuit failures due to\nmechanical stress, electrostatic discharge and environmental degradation.\nPassive approaches such as the use of stretchable conductors and novel\ngeometries improve their response to mechanical stress but cannot salvage the\ninterconnect if a fault were to occur. Active approaches using self healing\ntechniques can repair a fault and have been demonstrated using methods that\neither use relatively rare materials, change conventional interconnect\nfabrication processes, only address faults due to mechanical stress or do not\npermit stretching. In this work we discuss a self healing technique that\novercomes these limitations and demonstrate heals having metallic conductivity\nand nearly plastic stretchability. This is achieved using a dispersion of\nconductive particles in an insulating fluid encapsulated over the interconnect.\nHealing is automatically triggered by the electric field appearing in the open\ngap of a failed interconnect, irrespective of the cause of failure. The field\npolarizes the conductive particles causing them aggregate and chain up to\nbridge the gap and repair the fault. Using copper-silicone oil dispersions, we\nshow self healing interconnects with the stretchable heal having conductivity\nof about $5 \\times 10^{5}$ Sm and allowing strains from 12 to 60. Previously,\nstretchable interconnects used materials other than copper. Here we effectively\nshow self healing, stretchable copper. This work promises high speed, self\nhealing and stretchable interconnects on flex thereby improving system\nreliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 14:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

The paper is motivated to bridge\ntractable logics specialized for expressing separately dense-time real-time\nproperties and context-free properties by ensuring decidability and\ntractability in the combined setting. To this end we introduce two real-time\nlinear temporal logics for specifying quantitative timing context-free\nrequirements in a pointwise semantics setting: Event-Clock Nested Temporal\nLogic (ECNTL) and Nested Metric Temporal Logic (NMTL). The logic ECNTL is an\nextension of both the logic CARET (a context-free extension of standard LTL)\nand Event-Clock Temporal Logic (a tractable real-time logical framework related\nto the class of Event-Clock automata). We prove that satisfiability of ECNTL\nand visibly model-checking of Visibly Pushdown Timed Automata VPTA against\nECNTL are decidable and EXPTIME-complete. The other proposed logic NMTL is a\ncontext-free extension of standard Metric Temporal Logic (MTL). It is well\nknown that satisfiability of future MTL is undecidable when interpreted over\ninfinite timed words but decidable over finite timed words. On the other hand,\nwe show that by augmenting future MTL with future context-free temporal\noperators, the satisfiability problem turns out to be undecidable also for\nfinite timed words. On the positive side, we devise a meaningful and decidable\nfragment of the logic NMTL which is expressively equivalent to ECNTL and for\nwhich satisfiability and visibly model-checking of VPTA are EXPTIME-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 14:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 14:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

These molecules are received when they chemically react with compliant\nreceptors deployed on the receiver surface. In these conditions, if the release\nrate is relatively high and the drug absorption time is significant, congestion\nmay happen, essentially at the receiver site. This phenomenon limits the drug\nabsorption rate and makes the signal transmission ineffective, with an\nundesired diffusion of drug molecules elsewhere in the body.

This rapid mixing underlies Landau damping of these\nfluctuations in a quiescent plasma-one of the most fundamental physical\nphenomena that make plasma different from a conventional fluid. Nevertheless,\nbroad power-law spectra of compressive fluctuations are observed in turbulent\nastrophysical plasmas (most vividly, in the solar wind) under conditions\nconducive to strong Landau damping. Elsewhere in nature, such spectra are\nnormally associated with fluid turbulence, where energy cannot be dissipated in\nthe inertial scale range and is therefore cascaded from large scales to small.\nBy direct numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, it is shown here\nthat turbulence of compressive fluctuations in collisionless plasmas strongly\nresembles one in a collisional fluid and does have broad power-law spectra.\nThis \"fluidization\" of collisionless plasmas occurs because phase mixing is\nstrongly suppressed on average by \"stochastic echoes\", arising due to nonlinear\nadvection of the particle distribution by turbulent motions. Besides resolving\nthe long-standing puzzle of observed compressive fluctuations in the solar\nwind, our results suggest a conceptual shift for understanding kinetic plasma\nturbulence generally: rather than being a system where Landau damping plays the\nrole of dissipation, a collisionless plasma is effectively dissipationless\nexcept at very small scales.

The key idea is to intentionally\nviolate the DRAM access timing parameters and use the resulting errors as the\nsource of randomness. Our technique specifically decreases the DRAM row\nactivation latency (timing parameter tRCD) below manufacturer-recommended\nspecifications, to induce read errors, or activation failures, that exhibit\ntrue random behavior. We then aggregate the resulting data from multiple cells\nto obtain a TRNG capable of providing a high throughput of random numbers at\nlow latency.\n  To demonstrate that our TRNG design is viable using commodity DRAM chips, we\nrigorously characterize the behavior of activation failures in 282\nstate-of-the-art LPDDR4 devices from three major DRAM manufacturers. We verify\nour observations using four additional DDR3 DRAM devices from the same\nmanufacturers. Our results show that many cells in each device produce random\ndata that remains robust over both time and temperature variation. We use our\nobservations to develop D-RanGe, a methodology for extracting true random\nnumbers from commodity DRAM devices with high throughput and low latency by\ndeliberately violating the read access timing parameters. We evaluate the\nquality of our TRNG using the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for\nrandomness and find that D-RaNGe: 1) successfully passes each test, and 2)\ngenerates true random numbers with over two orders of magnitude higher\nthroughput than the previous highest-throughput DRAM-based TRNG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 15:22:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 20:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Excellent temporal coverage was obtained with more than 25\ninstruments, including the MAGIC, FACT and VERITAS Cherenkov telescopes, the\ninstruments on board the Swift and Fermi spacecraft, and the telescopes\noperated by the GASP-WEBT collaboration.\n  Mrk 501 showed a very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray flux above 0.2 TeV of\n$\\sim$0.5 times the Crab Nebula flux (CU) for most of the campaign. The highest\nactivity occurred on 2012 June 9, when the VHE flux was $\\sim$3 CU, and the\npeak of the high-energy spectral component was found to be at $\\sim$2 TeV. This\nstudy reports very hard X-ray spectra, and the hardest VHE spectra measured to\ndate for Mrk 501. The fractional variability was found to increase with energy,\nwith the highest variability occurring at VHE, and a significant correlation\nbetween the X-ray and VHE bands.\n  The unprecedentedly hard X-ray and VHE spectra measured imply that their low-\nand high-energy components peaked above 5 keV and 0.5 TeV, respectively, during\na large fraction of the observing campaign, and hence that Mrk 501 behaved like\nan extreme high-frequency- peaked blazar (EHBL) throughout the 2012 observing\nseason. This suggests that being an EHBL may not be a permanent characteristic\nof a blazar, but rather a state which may change over time. The one-zone\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario can successfully describe the segments\nof the SED where most energy is emitted, with a significant correlation between\nthe electron energy density and the VHE gamma-ray activity, suggesting that\nmost of the variability may be explained by the injection of high-energy\nelectrons. The one-zone SSC scenario used reproduces the behaviour seen between\nthe measured X-ray and VHE gamma-ray fluxes, and predicts that the correlation\nbecomes stronger with increasing energy of the X-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 15:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 22:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The reason that we train 3-D rank-1 filters in the\ntraining stage instead of consecutive 1-D filters is that a better gradient\nflow can be obtained with this setting, which makes the training possible even\nin the case where the network with consecutive 1-D filters cannot be trained.\nThe 3-D rank-1 filters are updated by both the gradient flow and the outer\nproduct of the 1-D filters in every epoch, where the gradient flow tries to\nobtain a solution which minimizes the loss function, while the outer product\noperation tries to make the parameters of the filter to live on a rank-1\nsub-space.

Collision warning systems (CCWs), as a\nproposed solution framework, can be relied as the main structure to address the\nissues in this area.

However,\nanother vehicle information is available through a wireless communication. Data\nloss is very common issue for such communication approach. As a consequence,\nCCW would suffer from providing late or false detection awareness.

Our results give\nfundamental new insight into the role of magnetization in stabilizing the\nnematic phase, while also providing a new knob with which it can be effectively\ntuned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 15:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

During SKA1, a Low-Frequency Aperture Array (LFAA) comprising over a\nhundred thousand individual dipole antenna elements will be constructed in\nWestern Australia (SKA1-LOW), while an array of 197 parabolic-receptor\nantennas, incorporating the 64 receptors of MeerKAT, will be constructed in\nSouth Africa (SKA1-MID). Radio telescope arrays, such as the SKA, require\nphase-coherent reference signals to be transmitted to each antenna site in the\narray. In the case of the SKA, these reference signals are generated at a\ncentral site and transmitted to the antenna sites via fibre-optic cables up to\n175 km in length. Environmental perturbations affect the optical path length of\nthe fibre and act to degrade the phase stability of the reference signals\nreceived at the antennas, which has the ultimate effect of reducing the\nfidelity and dynamic range of the data . Given the combination of long fibre\ndistances and relatively high frequencies of the transmitted reference signals,\nthe SKA needs to employ actively-stabilised frequency transfer technologies to\nsuppress the fibre-optic link noise in order to maintain phase-coherence across\nthe array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 03:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

In this\nwork, we show that time fractional generalization of the cable equation arises\nnaturally in the CTRW by considering a superposition of Markovian processes and\nin a {\\it ggBm-like} construction of the random variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 14:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

Their structures share some similarities with photosynthetic antenna\ncomplexes, particularly in the ordered arrangement of photoactive molecules\nwith large transition dipole moments. As the role of photoexcitations in\nmicrotubules remains an open question, here we analyze tryptophan molecules,\nthe amino acid building block of microtubules with the largest transition\ndipole strength. By taking their positions and dipole orientations from\nrealistic models capable of reproducing tubulin experimental spectra, and using\na Hamiltonian widely employed in quantum optics to describe light-matter\ninteractions, we show that such molecules arranged in their native microtubule\nconfiguration exhibit a superradiant ground state, which represents an\nexcitation fully extended on the chromophore lattice. We also show that such a\nsuperradiant ground state emerges due to supertransfer coupling between the\nground states of smaller blocks of the microtubule. In the dynamics we find\nthat the spreading of excitation is ballistic in the absence of external\nsources of disorder and strongly dependent on initial conditions. The velocity\nof photoexcitation spreading is shown to be enhanced by the supertransfer\neffect with respect to the velocity one would expect from the strength of the\nnearest-neighbor coupling between tryptophan molecules in the microtubule.\nFinally, such structures are shown to have an enhanced robustness to static\ndisorder when compared to geometries that include only short-range\ninteractions. These cooperative effects (superradiance and supertransfer) may\ninduce ultra-efficient photoexcitation absorption and could enhance excitonic\nenergy transfer in microtubules over long distances under physiological\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2018 23:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}
