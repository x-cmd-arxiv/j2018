In cognitive backscatter systems, the backscatter device (BD) shares not\nonly the same spectrum, but also the same radio-frequency (RF) source with the\nlegacy system. In this paper, we investigate the signal transmission problem,\nin which a basic transmission model is considered which consists of K RF\nsources, one BD and one reader equipped with M antennas. A non-cooperative\nscenario is considered, where there is no cooperation between the legacy\nsystems and the backscatter system, and no pilots are transmitted from the RF\nsources or BD to the reader. The on-off keying differential modulation is\nadopted to achieve noncoherent transmission. Firstly, through the capacity\nanalyses, we point out that high-throughput backscatter transmission can be\nachieved when the number of the receive antennas satisfies M>K. The Chernoff\nInformation (CI) is also derived to predict the detection performance. Next, we\naddress the signal detection problem at the reader.

To tackle the non-cooperation challenge, a fully\nblind channel estimation method is proposed to learn the detection-required\nparameters based on clustering.

The\nproposed algorithm achieves accurate predictions of the pressure and velocity\nfields in both two and three dimensional flows for several benchmark problems\nmotivated by real-world applications.

Most cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations focus\ntheir computational effort on the galaxies themselves and treat the CGM more\ncoarsely, which means small-scale structure cannot be resolved.

The covering fraction of Lyman-Limit\nSystems within 150 kpc is almost doubled. We therefore conclude that some of\nthe observational properties of the CGM are strongly resolution dependent.\nIncreasing the resolution in the CGM, without increasing the resolution of the\ngalaxies, is a promising and computationally efficient method to push the\nboundaries of state-of-the-art simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 15:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

Our search\nalso detects CO(2-1) line emission from optically dark, dusty star-forming\ngalaxies at $z>5$. We find a range of spatial sizes for the CO-traced gas\nreservoirs up to $\\sim40$ kpc, suggesting that spatially extended cold\nmolecular gas reservoirs may be common in massive, gas-rich galaxies at\n$z\\sim2$. Through CO line stacking, we constrain the gas mass fraction in\npreviously known typical star-forming galaxies at $z=2$-3. The stacked CO\ndetection suggests lower molecular gas mass fractions than expected for massive\nMain Sequence galaxies by a factor of $\\sim3-6$.

Thus, an\nalternative strategy for these platforms could be to promote counterspeech as a\ndefense against hate content.

This analysis results in various interesting insights such as: the\ncounterspeech comments receive much more likes as compared to the\nnon-counterspeech comments, for certain communities majority of the\nnon-counterspeech comments tend to be hate speech, the different types of\ncounterspeech are not all equally effective and the language choice of users\nposting counterspeech is largely different from those posting non-counterspeech\nas revealed by a detailed psycholinguistic analysis.

A wide spectrum of practical applications have\nrenewed the interest in these questions, and spawned variants: for full\ncoverage, every point has to be covered, for subset coverage, specific points\nhave to be covered, and for penalty coverage, points may be left uncovered by\nincurring an individual penalty.\n  We make a number of contributions. We first show that finding a minimum-turn\n(full) cycle cover is NP-hard even in 2-dimensional grid graphs, solving the\nlong-standing open Problem 53 in The Open Problems Project edited by Demaine,\nMitchell and O'Rourke.

Electron transfer from donors in\nthe n-SrTiO3 to the p-Ge creates a space-charge region in the Ge resulting in\ndownward band bending which spans most of the Ge gap. This strong downward band\nbending facilitates visible-light, photo-generated electron transfer from Ge to\nSTO, favorable to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction associated with water\nsplitting. Ti 2p and Sr 3d core-level line shapes reveal that the STO bands are\nflat despite the space-charge layer therein. Inclusion of the effect of Ge band\nbending on band alignment is significant, amounting to a ~0.4 eV reduction in\nvalence band offset compared to the value resulting from using spectra averaged\nover all layers. Density functional theory allows candidate interface\nstructural models deduced from scanning transmission electron microscopy images\nto be simulated and structurally optimized. These structures are used to\ngenerate multi-slice simulations that reproduce the experimental images quite\nwell. The calculated band offsets for these structures are in good agreement\nwith experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 20:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

For given parameters characterising the impact event, we estimate\nthe escaping mass and assess its subsequent collisional evolution in a\ncircumstellar orbit, assuming a Sun-like host star.

For a 20 km\ndiameter impactor, we find that the dust mass escaping the exoplanet is roughly\ncomparable to the zodiacal dust. The collisional evolution is best modelled by\nconsidering two independent dust populations, a spalled population consisting\nof non-melted ejecta evolving on timescales of millions of years, and dust\nrecondensed from melt or vapour evolving on much shorter timescales. While the\npresence of dust can potentially be inferred with current telescopes, studying\nits composition requires advanced instrumentation not yet available.

For example, birds\n(Aves) can be categorized according to a four-level hierarchy of order, family,\ngenus, and species. This hierarchy encodes rich correlations among various\ncategories across different levels, which can effectively regularize the\nsemantic space and thus make prediction less ambiguous. However, previous\nstudies of fine-grained image recognition primarily focus on categories of one\ncertain level and usually overlook this correlation information. In this work,\nwe investigate simultaneously predicting categories of different levels in the\nhierarchy and integrating this structured correlation information into the deep\nneural network by developing a novel Hierarchical Semantic Embedding (HSE)\nframework. Specifically, the HSE framework sequentially predicts the category\nscore vector of each level in the hierarchy, from highest to lowest. At each\nlevel, it incorporates the predicted score vector of the higher level as prior\nknowledge to learn finer-grained feature representation. During training, the\npredicted score vector of the higher level is also employed to regularize label\nprediction by using it as soft targets of corresponding sub-categories. To\nevaluate the proposed framework, we organize the 200 bird species of the\nCaltech-UCSD birds dataset with the four-level category hierarchy and construct\na large-scale butterfly dataset that also covers four level categories.\nExtensive experiments on these two and the newly-released VegFru datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our HSE framework over the baseline methods and\nexisting competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 02:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

However, randomizing units to treatment and control often leads to\ncovariate imbalances in realization, and such imbalances can inflate the\nvariance of estimators of the treatment effect. One solution to this problem is\nrerandomization---an experimental design strategy that randomizes units until\nsome balance criterion is fulfilled---which yields more precise estimators of\nthe treatment effect if covariates are correlated with the outcome. Most\nrerandomization schemes in the literature utilize the Mahalanobis distance,\nwhich may not be preferable when covariates are correlated or vary in\nimportance. As an alternative, we introduce an experimental design strategy\ncalled ridge rerandomization, which utilizes a modified Mahalanobis distance\nthat addresses collinearities among covariates and automatically places a\nhierarchy of importance on the covariates according to their eigenstructure.\nThis modified Mahalanobis distance has connections to principal components and\nthe Euclidean distance, and---to our knowledge---has remained unexplored. We\nestablish several theoretical properties of this modified Mahalanobis distance\nand our ridge rerandomization scheme. These results guarantee that ridge\nrerandomization is preferable over randomization and suggest when ridge\nrerandomization is preferable over standard rerandomization schemes. We also\nprovide simulation evidence that suggests that ridge rerandomization is\nparticularly preferable over typical rerandomization schemes in\nhigh-dimensional or high-collinearity settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 03:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 21:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

This picture is appropriate when\nthe coupling, $M$, of conduction electrons to the spin texture is strong\n(strong-coupling regime) and the adiabatic condition is satisfied. However, in\nthe weak-coupling regime, where the coupling $M$ is smaller than the electrons'\nscattering rate, the adiabatic condition is not satisfied and the Berry phase\npicture does not hold. In such a regime, the relation of the effective magnetic\nfield to the spin texture can be \"nonlocal\", in contrast to the \"local\"\nrelation in the strong coupling case. Focusing on the case of continuous but\ngeneral spin texture, we investigate the THE in various characteristic regions\nin the weak-coupling regime, namely, (1) diffusive and local, (2) diffusive and\nnonlocal, and (3) ballistic. In the presence of spin relaxation, there arise\ntwo more regions in the \"weakest-coupling\" regime: (1') diffusive and local,\nand (2') diffusive and nonlocal. We derived the analytic expression of the\ntopological Hall conductivity (THC) for each region, and found that the\ncondition for the locality of the effective field is governed by transverse\nspin diffusion of electrons. In region 1, where the spin relaxation is\nnegligible and the effective field is local, the THC is found to be\nproportional to $M$, instead of $M^3$ of the weakest-coupling regime. In the\ndiffusive, nonlocal regions (2 and 2'), the effective field is given by a spin\nchirality formed by \"effective spins\" that the electrons see during their\ndiffusive motion.

A sharp edge modelled as a hyperbolic\ntangent function coupled with supersonic corrections to the classical type I\nmigration torques results in the innermost planets being pushed inside the\ncavity through resonant interaction with farther planets because migration is\nstarward at slightly supersonic eccentricities. Planets below a few Earth\nmasses are generally trapped in a resonant chain with the outermost planet near\nthe disc edge, but long-term stability is not guaranteed. For more massive\nplanets the migration is so fast that the eccentricity of the innermost\nresonant pair is excited to highly supersonic levels due to decreased damping\non the innermost planet as it is pushed inside the cavity; collisions\nfrequently occur and the system consists one or two intermediate-mass planets\nresiding closer to the star than the disc's inner edge.

While most recent works\nfor moving video object segmentation fail in this scenario, our method\ngenerates an accurate segmentation of a single moving object. The proposed\nmethod performs a sparse segmentation, where frame-wise labels are assigned\nonly to trajectory coordinates, followed by the pixel-wise labeling of frames.\nThe sparse segmentation involving stabilization and clustering of trajectories\nin a 3-stage iterative process. At the 1st stage, the trajectories are\nclustered using pairwise Procrustes distance as a cue for creating an affinity\nmatrix. The 2nd stage performs a block-wise Procrustes analysis of the\ntrajectories and estimates Frechet means (in Kendall's shape space) of the\nclusters. The Frechet means represent the average trajectories of the motion\nclusters. An optimization function has been formulated to stabilize the Frechet\nmeans, yielding stabilized trajectories at the 3rd stage. The accuracy of the\nmotion clusters are iteratively refined, producing distinct groups of\nstabilized trajectories. Next, the labels obtained from the sparse segmentation\nare propagated for pixel-wise labeling of the frames, using a GraphCut based\nenergy formulation.

Selection\nof strongly heated islands and their reshaping, both originating from the\nexcitation of plasmonic resonances, are strongly influenced by the polarization\ndirection of laser illumination, so that the colours produced are well\npronounced only when viewed with the same polarization. Conversely, the laser\ncolour writing with circular polarizations results in bright\npolarization-independent colour images. The fabrication procedure for\nnear-percolation reflector arrays is exceedingly simple and scalable to mass\nproduction, while the laser-induced modification occurs inherently with the\nsubwavelength resolution.

Their MIR fluxes are produced by a combination of continuum and\nPAH emission features. The PAH features can dominate the total MIR flux, but\nare difficult to measure without spectroscopy. We aim to study star-forming\ngalaxies by using a blind spectroscopic survey at MIR wavelengths to understand\nevolution of their star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR up to z~=0.5, by\npaying particular attention to their PAH properties. We conducted a\nlow-resolution (R~=50) slitless spectroscopic survey at 5-13um of 9um\nflux-selected sources (>0.3 mJy) around the North Ecliptic Pole with the\nInfrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI. After removing 11 AGN candidates by using\nthe IRC photometry, we identified 48 PAH galaxies with PAH 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6um\nfeatures at z<0.5. The rest-frame optical-MIR spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) based on CFHT and AKARI/IRC imaging covering 0.37-18um were produced,\nand analysed in conjunction with the PAH spectroscopy. We defined the PAH\nenhancement by using the luminosity ratio of the 7.7um PAH feature over the\n3.5um stellar component of the SEDs. The rest-frame SEDs of all PAH galaxies\nhave a universal shape with stellar and 7.7um bumps, except that the PAH\nenhancement significantly varies as a function of the PAH luminosities. We\nidentified a PAH-enhanced population at z~>0.35, whose SEDs and luminosities\nare typical of luminous infrared galaxies. They show particularly larger PAH\nenhancement at high luminosity, implying that they are vigorous star-forming\ngalaxies with elevated specific SFR. Our composite starburst model that\ncombines a very young and optically very thick starburst with a very old\npopulation can successfully reproduce most of their SED characteristics,\nalthough we could not confirm this optically thick component from our spectral\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 07:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

It was shown that the phase trajectories of the\ncorresponding dynamic systems can be split by bifurcation trajectories into 2,4\nor 6 different dynamic streams corresponding to different pairwise symmetric\nhistories of the Universe depending on the parameters of the scalar field's\nmodel. The phase space of such systems becomes multiply connected, the ranges\nof negative total effective energy unavailable for motion, getting appear\nthere.

As such, the\ntransportations of magnetic energy across the photosphere were toward solar\ninterior during these flares.

The best fit to data yields\n$q_\\mathrm{d} = -8.03$ and $S = 0.0262~(\\Rightarrow d \\sim 100~\\mathrm{Mpc})$,\nrejecting isotropy ($q_\\mathrm{d} = 0$) with $3.9\\sigma$ statistical\nsignificance, while $q_\\mathrm{m} = -0.157$ and consistent with no acceleration\n($q_\\mathrm{m} = 0$) at $1.4\\sigma$. Thus the cosmic acceleration deduced from\nsupernovae may be an artefact of our being non-Copernican observers, rather\nthan evidence for a dominant component of `dark energy' in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 09:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 18:44:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 12:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

However,\nexisting works addressing the planning issues consider a simple case of perfect\ndelivery without service interruption, e.g., due to accident which is common\nand realistic. Therefore, this paper introduces the joint ground and aerial\ndelivery service optimization and planning (GADOP) framework. The framework\nexplicitly incorporates uncertainty of drone package delivery, i.e., takeoff\nand breakdown conditions. The GADOP framework aims to minimize the total\ndelivery cost given practical constraints, e.g., traveling distance limit.\nSpecifically, we formulate the GADOP framework as a three-stage stochastic\ninteger programming model. To deal with the high complexity issue of the\nproblem, a decomposition method is adopted. Then, the performance of the GADOP\nframework is evaluated by using two data sets including Solomon benchmark suite\nand the real data from one of the Singapore logistics companies. The\nperformance evaluation clearly shows that the GADOP framework can achieve\nsignificantly lower total payment than that of the baseline methods which do\nnot take uncertainty into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 10:32:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 03:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

On domains of\nsufficiently large aspect ratio, the steady state consists of turbulent plumes\npenetrating an interface between two layers of approximately uniform buoyancy.\nAs described by Baines and Turner (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 37, 1969, pp. 51-80),\nupon penetrating the interface the flow in each plume becomes forced and\nbehaves like a constant-momentum jet, due to a reduction in its mean buoyancy\nrelative to the local environment. To observe the behaviour of the plumes we\npartition the domain into sub-domains corresponding to each plume. Domains of\nrelatively small aspect ratio produce a single primary mean-flow circulation\nbetween the sub-domains that is maintained by entrainment into the plumes. At\nlarger aspect ratios the mean flow between the sub-domains bifurcates,\nindicating the existence of a secondary circulation within each layer\nassociated with entrainment into the jets. To study the flow's energetics we\nuse a local definition of available potential energy (APE). For plumes with\nGaussian velocity and buoyancy profiles, the theory we develop suggests that\nthe kinetic energy dissipation is split equally between the jets and the plumes\nand, collectively, accounts for almost half of the input of APE at the\nboundaries. In contrast, $1/4$ of the APE dissipation and background potential\nenergy (BPE) production occurs in the jets, with the remaining $3/4$ occurring\nin the plumes. These bulk theoretical predictions agree with observations of\nBPE production from simulations to within $1\\%$ and form the basis of a\nsimilarity solution that models the vertical dependence of APE dissipation and\nBPE production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 10:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 07:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 11:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

If this produces a cycle, this cycle is\ncontracted. This growing phase ends when the graph has been contracted into a\nsingle node and a subsequent cleanup step removes redundant edges in reverse\norder.\n  We analyze the algorithm using the primal-dual method showing that its\nsolution value is at most 3 times the optimum.

This provides a dynamical mechanism for\nthe formation of long lived scalar hair, which could lead to observable signals\nin cases where the axion interacts with baryonic matter around the BH, or where\nit forms the seed of a future superradiant build up in highly spinning cases.\nConsidering NS-AS collisions we find two possible final states (i) a BH\nsurrounded by a (small) scalar cloud, or (ii) a stable NS enveloped in an axion\ncloud of roughly the same mass as the initial AS. Whilst for low mass ASs the\nNS is only mildly perturbed by the collision, a larger mass AS gives rise to a\nmassive ejection of baryonic mass from the system, purely due to gravitational\neffects. Therefore, even in the absence of a direct axion coupling to baryonic\nmatter, NS-AS collisions could give rise to electromagnetic observables in\naddition to their gravitational wave signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

We address the issue of background\nsubtraction by suggesting a signal restoration routine based on the\nmaximization of mutual information algorithm and solve the problem of finding\nthe geometrical center in the reconstruction by using a tight-centered object\nsupport in a two-step phase retrieval procedure. The proposed image processing\nand improved phase retrieval procedures are used to reconstruct the highest\noccupied molecular orbital of pentacene on Ag(110), using photoemission data\nonly. The results of the reconstruction agree well with the density functional\ntheory simulation, modified to comply with the experimental conditions. By\ncomparison with photoelectron holography, we show that the reconstructed\ntwo-dimensional orbital distribution can be interpreted as a superposition of\nthe in-focus orbital distribution evaluated at the z = 0 plane and out-of-focus\ndistributions evaluated at other z = const planes. Three-dimensional molecular\norbital distributions could thus be reconstructed directly from two-dimensional\nphotoemission data, provided the axial resolution of the imaging system is high\nenough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:50:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 10:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

Therefore, starting from a background exact solution with\nsymmetries, one uses the perturbation theory, which albeit approximately,\nprovides a lot of information regarding a physical solution.

Namely, by going to higher order\nperturbation theory, one should be able to improve and better approximate the\nphysical problem or the solution. While this is often the case in many theories\nand many background solutions, there are important cases where the linear\nperturbation theory simply fails for various reasons. This issue is well known\nin the context of general relativity through the works that started in the\nearly 1970s, but it has only been recently studied in modified gravity\ntheories.

A DNN's architecture\n(i.e., its hyper-parameters) broadly determines the DNN's accuracy and\nperformance, and is often confidential. Attacking a DNN in the cloud to obtain\nits architecture can potentially provide major commercial value. Further,\nattaining a DNN's architecture facilitates other, existing DNN attacks.\n  This paper presents Cache Telepathy: a fast and accurate mechanism to steal a\nDNN's architecture using the cache side channel. Our attack is based on the\ninsight that DNN inference relies heavily on tiled GEMM (Generalized Matrix\nMultiply), and that DNN architecture parameters determine the number of GEMM\ncalls and the dimensions of the matrices used in the GEMM functions. Such\ninformation can be leaked through the cache side channel.\n  This paper uses Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload to attack VGG and ResNet DNNs\nrunning OpenBLAS and Intel MKL libraries. Our attack is effective in helping\nobtain the architectures by very substantially reducing the search space of\ntarget DNN architectures. For example, for VGG using OpenBLAS, it reduces the\nsearch space from more than $10^{35}$ architectures to just 16.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 15:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

We build a galaxy pair catalog requiring $r_p <\n100\\kpc$ and $\\Delta V < 500 \\kms $ within redshift $z<0.1$ from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS). We divided the galaxy pair catalog taking into\naccount the morphological classification by defining three pair categories\ncomposed by elliptical-elliptical (E-E), elliptical-spiral (E-S) and\nspiral-spiral (S-S) galaxies. We use a previously defined catalog of filaments\nobtained from SDSS and we select pairs located closer than $1\\mpc$ from the\nfilament spine, which are considered as members of filaments.

R{\\'e}sum{\\'e}. The aim\nof this article is to propose on the one hand a brief history of modeling\nstarting from the works of Fibonacci, Robert Malthus, Pierre Francis Verhulst\nand then Vito Volterra and, on the other hand, to present the main hypotheses\nof the very famous but very little known predator-prey model elaborated in the\n1920s by Volterra in order to solve a problem posed by his son-in-law, Umberto\nD'Ancona. It is thus shown that, contrary to a widely-held notion, Volterra's\nmodel is realistic and his seminal work laid the groundwork for modern\npopulation dynamics and mathematical ecology, including seasonality, migration,\npollution and more. 1. A short history of modeling 1.1. The Malthusian model.\nIf the rst scientic view of population growth seems to be that of Leonardo\nFibonacci [2], also called Leonardo of Pisa, whose famous sequence of numbers\nwas presented in his Liber abaci (1202) as a solution to a population growth\nproblem, the modern foundations of population dynamics clearly date from Thomas\nRobert Malthus [20]. Considering an ideal population consisting of a single\nhomogeneous animal species, that is, neglecting the variations in age, size and\nany periodicity for birth or mortality, and which lives alone in an invariable\nenvironment or coexists with other species without any direct or indirect\ninuence, he founded in 1798, with his celebrated claim Population, when\nunchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio, the paradigm of exponential\ngrowth. This consists in assuming that the increase of the number N (t) of\nindividuals of this population, during a short interval of time, is\nproportional to N (t). This translates to the following dierential equation :\n(1) dN (t) dt = $\\epsilon$N (t) where $\\epsilon$ is a constant factor of\nproportionality that represents the growth coe-cient or growth rate. By\nintegrating (1) we obtain the law of exponential growth or law of Malthusian\ngrowth (see Fig. 1). This law, which does not take into account the limits\nimposed by the environment on growth and which is in disagreement with the\nactual facts, had a profound inuence on Charles Darwin's work on natural\nselection. Indeed, Darwin [1] founded the idea of survival of the ttest on the\n1. According to Frontier and Pichod-Viale [3] the correct terminology should be\npopulation kinetics, since the interaction between species cannot be\nrepresented by forces. 2.

To link the macroworld to the microworld, we propose and\ndemonstrate a biological signal conversion interface that can also be seen as a\nmicroscale modulator. In particular, the proposed interface transduces an\noptical signal, which is controlled using an LED, into a chemical signal by\nchanging the pH of the environment. The modulator is realized using E. coli\nbacteria as microscale entity expressing the light-driven proton pump\ngloeorhodopsin from Gloeobacter violaceus. Upon inducing external light\nstimuli, these bacteria locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting\nprotons into the environment. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed\noptical-to-chemical signal converter, we analyze the pH signal measured by a pH\nsensor, which serves as receiver. We develop an analytical parametric model for\nthe induced chemical signal as a function of the applied optical signal. Using\nthis model, we derive a training-based channel estimator which estimates the\nparameters of the proposed model to fit the measurement data. We further derive\nthe optimal maximum likelihood detector and a suboptimal low-complexity\ndetector to recover the transmitted data from the measured received signal. It\nis shown that the proposed parametric model is in good agreement with the\nmeasurement data. Moreover, for an example scenario, we show that the proposed\nsetup is able to successfully convert an optical signal representing a sequence\nof binary symbols into a chemical signal with a bit rate of 1 bit/minute and\nrecover the transmitted data from the chemical signal using the proposed\nestimation and detection~schemes. The proposed modulator may form the basis for\nfuture MC testbeds and applications at microscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 15:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

An analytical approach in calculating\nthe refractive index of Erbium doped Gadolinium Gallium Garnet was reported by\nanother author previously. My first comment is related to the proposed solution\nby the other author, where I have shown an alternative approach that leads to a\ndifferent solution. Although my comments are made in relation to Erbium as the\ndopant and Gadolinium Gallium Garnet as the undoped lattice, the analytical\nsolution I propose here may be applied to any doped crystals. My second comment\nconcerns the limitations and mistreatment of McCumber relation in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 03:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}
