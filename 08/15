We report the detection of first\novertone carbon monoxide emission at $\\sim58.2$ d after discovery, one of the\nearliest detections of CO in an erupting supernova. We model the CO emission to\nderive the CO mass, temperature and velocity, assuming both pure $^{12}$CO and\na composition that includes $^{13}$CO; the case for the latter is the isotopic\nanalyses of meteoritic grains, which suggest that core collapse supernovae can\nsynthesise significant amounts of $^{13}$C. Our models show that, while the CO\ndata are adequately explained by pure $^{12}$CO, they do not preclude the\npresence of $^{13}$CO, to a limit of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C $> 3$, the first\nconstraint on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio determined from near-infrared\nobservations. We estimate the reddening to the object, and the effective\ntemperature from the energy distribution at outburst. We discuss whether the\nejecta of SN 2016adj may be carbon-rich, what the infrared data tell us about\nthe classification of this supernova, and what implications the early formation\nof CO in supernovae may have for CO formation in supernovae in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 16:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

We address the question of why strongly correlated\nd-wave superconductors, such as the cuprates, prove to be surprisingly robust\nagainst the introduction of non-magnetic impurities. We show that, very\ngenerally, both the pair-breaking and the normal state transport scattering\nrates are significantly suppressed by strong correlations effects arising in\nthe proximity to a Mott insulating state. We also show that the\ncorrelation-renormalized scattering amplitude is generically enhanced in the\nforward direction, an effect which was previously often ascribed to the\nspecific scattering by charged impurities outside the copper-oxide planes. We\nprovide the theoretical insights for resistive switching systems and show how\nimpurities and underlying correlations can play significant roles in practical\ndevices. We report the striking result of a connection between the resistive\nswitching and shock wave formation, a classic topic of non-linear dynamics. We\nargue that the profile of oxygen vacancies that migrate during the commutation\nforms a shock wave that propagates through a highly resistive region of the\ndevice. We validate the scenario by means of model simulations and experiments\nin a manganese-oxide based memristor device and we extend our theory to the\ncase of binary oxides. The shock wave scenario brings unprecedented physical\ninsight and enables to rationalize the process of oxygen-vacancy-driven\nresistive change with direct implications for a key technological aspect- the\ncommutation speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 16:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

By developing an appropriate methodology,\nthat can be generalized to any kind of soft particle, we are able to calculate\nall the elastic moduli of non-ionic microgels across their volume phase\ntransition (VPT). Remarkably, we reproduce many features seen in experiments,\nincluding the appearance of a minimum of the Poisson's ratio close to the VPT.\nBy calculating the particle-particle effective interactions and the resulting\ncollective behavior, we find that the Hertzian model works well up to moderate\nvalues of the packing fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 16:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 14:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

However, the origin of this unusual behavior is\ncontroversial, having been variously attributed to electronic correlations as\nwell as the phonon-drag effect. The optical properties of a material provide\ninformation on both the electronic and vibrational properties. The optical\nconductivity reveals an anisotropic response at room temperature; the\nlow-frequency optical conductivity decreases rapidly with temperature,\nsignalling a metal-insulator transition. One-dimensional semiconducting\nbehavior is observed along the $b$ axis at low temperature, in agreement with\nfirst-principle calculations.

A recent work of Czumaj, Peng,\nand Sohler (STOC'15) gave an ingenious sublinear time algorithm for testing\n$k$-clusterability in time $\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2} \\text{poly}(k))$: their algorithm\nimplicitly embeds a random sample of vertices of the graph into Euclidean\nspace, and then clusters the samples based on estimates of Euclidean distances\nbetween the points. This yields a very efficient testing algorithm, but only\nworks if the cluster structure is very strong: it is necessary to assume that\nthe gap between conductances of accepted and rejected graphs is at least\nlogarithmic in the size of the graph $G$. In this paper we show how one can\nleverage more refined geometric information, namely angles as opposed to\ndistances, to obtain a sublinear time tester that works even when the gap is a\nsufficiently large constant.

At the\nsame time, the material above the collapsing core is rapidly ejected, leading\nto a stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) explosion if the outer hydrogen\nenvelope of the star was removed before its explosion. The envelope is\npresumably stripped either via strong stellar winds or due to mass transfer to\na companion star in a close binary orbit. It is not clear which process is\ndominant, and whether different mechanisms are at work for different classes of\nSESNe; type IIb, Ib, and Ic SNe in order of increasing degree of envelope\nstripping. In this work, a new analysis of late-time nebular spectra of SESNe\nis presented, which is more sensitive to differences in the core structure than\nearly-phase spectral analysis. The results show that the progenitors of SNe IIb\nand Ib are indistinguishable except for the residual amount of hydrogen\nenvelope while the progenitors of SNe Ic are not only deficient in hydrogen and\nhelium, but are also distinctly more massive than SNe IIb and Ib. These\nfindings strongly suggest that more than one mechanism is responsible for the\nremoval of the outer hydrogen envelope and the deeper helium layer, with the\nformer most likely due to binary interaction, and the latter involving a\nmass-dependent process such as strong stellar winds or episodic pre-explosion\nmass ejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 18:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

The latter behaviour is captured by the notion of audience retention\nrate, which measures the portion of a video content watched on average.

This\nrate is comparable to that of previous searches like SQLS even though the\nparent dataset of STRIDES is purely photometric and our selection of candidates\ncannot rely on spectroscopic information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 18:06:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 18:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

Because a point cloud is a set, there is no ordering to the\ncollection of points in a point-cloud classification problem. Thus, the\nchallenge of classifying point clouds inputs is in building a classifier which\nis agnostic to the ordering of the observations, yet preserves the\nd-dimensional information of each point in the set.

Our\nfindings support the claim that, for a particular notion of sparsity, loosely\nspeaking, \"Laplacian spectral embedding favors relatively sparse graphs,\nwhereas adjacency spectral embedding favors not-too-sparse graphs.\" We also\nprovide evidence in support of the claim that \"adjacency spectral embedding\nfavors core-periphery network structure.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 18:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

In our model, neurons\nperform leaky integration and synaptic weights are updated through a local\nmechanism. Our learning method generalizes Equilibrium Propagation to vector\nfield dynamics, relaxing the requirement of an energy function. As a\nconsequence of this generalization, the algorithm does not compute the true\ngradient of the objective function, but rather approximates it at a precision\nwhich is proven to be directly related to the degree of symmetry of the\nfeedforward and feedback weights. We show experimentally that our algorithm\noptimizes the objective function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 19:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

Plato's key novelty is the delivery of tight\ndeterministic error guarantees for time series analytics. Plato evaluates any\ntime series expression composed by the linear algebra operators over vectors,\nalong with arithmetic operators. This large scope of possible expressions\nincludes common use cases such as correlation and cross-correlation\nexpressions. Each time series is segmented either by fixed-length segmentation\nor by (a usually more effective) variable-length segmentation. Each segment is\ncompressed by an estimation/compression function that approximates the actual\nvalues and is coming from a user-chosen function family, as taught by many\nprior works. The novelty is that Plato associates to each segment 1 to 3\n(depending on the case) precomputed error measures and, using them, Plato\ncomputes tight deterministic error guarantees for analytics over the\ncompressions. Importantly, some compression families lead to much better\ndeterministic error guarantees. This work identifies two broad estimation\nfunction family groups (Vector Space (VS) and Linear Scalable Family (LSF)),\nwhich lead to theoretically and practically high-quality guarantees, even for\nexpressions (eg correlation) that combine multiple time series that have been\nindependently compressed and may, thus, use misaligned segmentations.

In the classical model, each player selects a path connecting her\nsource and target vertices. The cost of traversing an edge depends on the {\\em\nload}; namely, number of players that traverse it. Thus, it abstracts the fact\nthat different users may use a resource at different times and for different\ndurations, which plays an important role in determining the costs of the users\nin reality. For example, when transmitting packets in a communication network,\nrouting traffic in a road network, or processing a task in a production system,\nactual sharing and congestion of resources crucially depends on time.\n  In \\cite{AGK17}, we introduced {\\em timed network games}, which add a time\ncomponent to network games. Each vertex $v$ in the network is associated with a\ncost function, mapping the load on $v$ to the price that a player pays for\nstaying in $v$ for one time unit with this load. Each edge in the network is\nguarded by the time intervals in which it can be traversed, which forces the\nplayers to spend time in the vertices. In this work we significantly extend the\nway time can be referred to in timed network games. In the model we study, the\nnetwork is equipped with {\\em clocks}, and, as in timed automata, edges are\nguarded by constraints on the values of the clocks, and their traversal may\ninvolve a reset of some clocks. We argue that the stronger model captures many\nrealistic networks. The addition of clocks breaks the techniques we developed\nin \\cite{AGK17} and we develop new techniques in order to show that positive\nresults on classic network games carry over to the stronger timed setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

These semantic grammars generalize the\nspecific terminals used by the programmer to other words and phrases with\nrelated meanings, allowing the construction of compact grammars that match an\nentire region of the vector space rather than matching specific elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

Our analysis shows\nno significant correlation between M*, SFR, and the distance from the SFR-M*\nrelation with O32. We find a decrease in the fraction of galaxies with O32>1\nwith increasing M*, however, this is most likely a result of the relationship\nbetween O32 and metallicity, rather than between O32 and M*.

DM exams are\ngenerated by devices from different vendors, with diverse characteristics\nbetween and even within vendors. Physical properties of these devices and\npostprocessing of the images can greatly influence the resulting mammogram.\nThis results in the fact that a deep learning model trained on data from one\nvendor cannot readily be applied to data from another vendor. This paper\ninvestigates the use of tailored transfer learning methods based on adversarial\nlearning to tackle this problem. We consider a database of DM exams (mostly\nbilateral and two views) generated by Hologic and Siemens vendors. We analyze\ntwo transfer learning settings: 1) unsupervised transfer, where Hologic data\nwith soft lesion annotation at pixel level and Siemens unlabelled data are used\nto annotate images in the latter data; 2) weak supervised transfer, where exam\nlevel labels for images from the Siemens mammograph are available. We propose\ntailored variants of recent state-of-the-art methods for transfer learning\nwhich take into account the class imbalance and incorporate knowledge provided\nby the annotations at exam level. Results of experiments indicate the\nbeneficial effect of transfer learning in both transfer settings.

Designing and tuning a high-performance reward/cost\nfunctional for Level-4 autonomous driving vehicles with exposure to different\ndriving conditions is challenging. Traditionally, reward/cost functional tuning\ninvolves substantial human effort and time spent on both simulations and road\ntests. As the scenario becomes more complicated, tuning to improve the motion\nplanner performance becomes increasingly difficult. To systematically solve\nthis issue, we develop a data-driven auto-tuning framework based on the Apollo\nautonomous driving framework. The framework includes a novel rank-based\nconditional inverse reinforcement learning algorithm, an offline training\nstrategy and an automatic method of collecting and labeling data. Our\nauto-tuning framework has the following advantages that make it suitable for\ntuning an autonomous driving motion planner. First, compared to that of most\ninverse reinforcement learning algorithms, our algorithm training is efficient\nand capable of being applied to different scenarios. Second, the offline\ntraining strategy offers a safe way to adjust the parameters before public road\ntesting. Third, the expert driving data and information about the surrounding\nenvironment are collected and automatically labeled, which considerably reduces\nthe manual effort. Finally, the motion planner tuned by the framework is\nexamined via both simulation and public road testing and is shown to achieve\ngood performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 22:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

Commonly used linear or\nnonlinear constitutive material models only cover a tiny part of possible\nmaterial behavior. In this work we propose a unified framework for modeling\ndeformable material. The key idea is to use a neural network to correct a\nnominal model of the elastic and damping properties of the object. The neural\nnetwork encapsulates a complex function that is hard to explicitly model. It\ninjects force corrections that help the forward simulation to more accurately\npredict the true behavior of a given soft object, which includes non-linear\nelastic forces and damping.

The main\nresult is that the critical and temperature behavior is primarily determined by\ntopological defects that are present in all cases. In the case of planar spins,\nvortices, fractional vortices and domain walls are present in the system. Their\ninteraction leads to the appearance of the phase of a chiral spin liquid, or\ninduces a single first-order transition, and in the vicinity of the Lifshitz\npoint vortices lead to a reentrant phase transition to the phase with a\ncollinear quasi-long-range order.

Combined with several observed\nproperties, we confirm the system is indeed young. Columba is the most probable\nmoving group, to which the GJ1108A system belongs, although its membership to\nthe group has not been established. If the age of Columba is assumed for\nGJ1108A, the dynamical masses of both GJ1108Aa and GJ1108Ab ($M_{\\rm\ndynamical,GJ1108Aa}=0.72\\pm0.04 M_{\\odot}$ and $M_{\\rm\ndynamical,GJ1108Ab}=0.30\\pm0.03 M_{\\odot}$) are more massive than what an\nevolutionary model predicts based on the age and luminosities. We consider the\ndiscrepancy in mass comparison can attribute to an age uncertainty; the system\nis likely older than stars in Columba, and effects that are not implemented in\nclassical models such as accretion history and magnetic activity are not\npreferred to explain the mass discrepancy. We also discuss the performance of\nthe evolutionary model by compiling similar low-mass objects in evolutionary\nstate based on the literature. Consequently, it is suggested that the current\nmodel on average reproduces the mass of resolved low-mass binaries without any\nsignificant offsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 07:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

To enable reliable high rate fronthaul\nlinks, we employ a hybrid radio frequency (RF)/free space optical (FSO) system\nfor fronthauling. To strike a balance between complexity and performance, we\nconsider three different quantization schemes at the RUs, namely per-antenna\nvector quantization (AVQ), per-RU vector quantization (RVQ), and distributed\nsource coding (DSC), and two different receivers at the CU, namely the linear\nminimum mean square error receiver and the optimal successive interference\ncancellation receiver. For this network architecture, we investigate the joint\noptimization of the quantization noise covariance matrices at the RUs and the\nRF time allocation to the multiple-access and fronthaul links for rate region\nmaximization. To this end, we formulate a unified weighted sum rate\nmaximization problem valid for each possible pair of the considered\nquantization and detection schemes. To handle the non-convexity of the unified\nproblem, we transform it into a bi-convex problem which facilitates the\nderivation of an efficient suboptimal solution using alternating convex\noptimization and golden section search. Our simulation results show that for\neach pair of the considered quantization and detection schemes, C-RAN with\nhybrid RF/FSO fronthauling can achieve a considerable sum rate gain compared to\nconventional systems employing pure FSO fronthauling, especially under\nunfavorable atmospheric conditions. Moreover, employing a more sophisticated\nquantization scheme can significantly improve the system performance under\nadverse atmospheric conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 09:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

Consequently,\nprocessors encounter frequent off-chip misses, and hence, lose a significant\nperformance potential. One way to reduce the number of off-chip misses is\nthrough using a well-behaved replacement policy in the LLC. Existing processors\nemploy a variation of least recently used (LRU) policy to determine a victim\nfor replacement. Unfortunately, there is a large gap between what LRU offers\nand that of Belady's MIN, which is the optimal replacement policy. Belady's MIN\nrequires selecting a victim with the longest reuse distance, and hence, is\nunfeasible due to the need to know the future. Consequently, Belady-inspired\nreplacement polices use Belady's MIN to derive an indicator to help them choose\na victim for replacement.\n  In this work, we show that the indicator that is used in the state-of-the-art\nBelady-inspired replacement policy is not decisive in picking a victim in a\nconsiderable number of cases, and hence, the policy has to rely on a standard\nmetric (e.g., recency or frequency) to pick a victim, which is inefficient. We\nobserve that there exist strong correlations among the hit counts of cache\nblocks in the same region of memory when Belady's MIN is the replacement\npolicy. Taking advantage of this observation, we propose an expected-hit-count\nindicator for the memory regions and use it to improve the victim selection\nmechanism of Belady-inspired replacement policies when the main indicator is\nnot decisive.

This success is primarily due\nto the vast capabilities of convolutional neural networks, that can extract\nuseful features from noisy and complex data. Games are excellent tools to test\nand push the boundaries of novel RL algorithms because they give valuable\ninsight into how well an algorithm can perform in isolated environments without\nthe real-life consequences. Real-time strategy games (RTS) is a genre that has\ntremendous complexity and challenges the player in short and long-term\nplanning. There is much research that focuses on applied RL in RTS games, and\nnovel advances are therefore anticipated in the not too distant future.\nHowever, there are to date few environments for testing RTS AIs. Environments\nin the literature are often either overly simplistic, such as microRTS, or\ncomplex and without the possibility for accelerated learning on consumer\nhardware like StarCraft II. This paper introduces the Deep RTS game environment\nfor testing cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms for RTS games. Deep\nRTS is a high-performance RTS game made specifically for artificial\nintelligence research. It supports accelerated learning, meaning that it can\nlearn at a magnitude of 50 000 times faster compared to existing RTS games.\nDeep RTS has a flexible configuration, enabling research in several different\nRTS scenarios, including partially observable state-spaces and map complexity.\nWe show that Deep RTS lives up to our promises by comparing its performance\nwith microRTS, ELF, and StarCraft II on high-end consumer hardware. Using Deep\nRTS, we show that a Deep Q-Network agent beats random-play agents over 70% of\nthe time.

The main reason\nfor this is that these methods boast remarkable predictive capabilities.\nHowever, most of these models remain black boxes, meaning that it is very\nchallenging for humans to follow and understand their intricate inner workings.\nConsequently, interpretability has suffered under this ever-increasing\ncomplexity of machine learning models. Especially with regards to new\nregulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the\nnecessity for plausibility and verifiability of predictions made by these black\nboxes is indispensable. Driven by the needs of industry and practice, the\nresearch community has recognised this interpretability problem and focussed on\ndeveloping a growing number of so-called explanation methods over the past few\nyears. These methods explain individual predictions made by black box machine\nlearning models and help to recover some of the lost interpretability. With the\nproliferation of these explanation methods, it is, however, often unclear,\nwhich explanation method offers a higher explanation quality, or is generally\nbetter-suited for the situation at hand. In this thesis, we thus propose an\naxiomatic framework, which allows comparing the quality of different\nexplanation methods amongst each other.

A topic of\nparticular interest are the interactions between the planet's ionospheric\nplasma and its highly structured crustal magnetic fields, and how these lead to\nthe redistribution of plasma and affect the propagation of radio waves in the\nsystem. In this paper, we elucidate a possible relationship between two\nanomalous radar signatures previously reported in observations from the MARSIS\ninstrument on MEX. Relatively uncommon observations of localized, extreme\nincreases in the ionospheric peak density in regions of radial (cusp-like)\nmagnetic fields and spread-echo radar signatures are shown to be coincident\nwith ducting of the same radar pulses at higher altitudes on the same field\nlines. We suggest that these two observations are both caused by a high\nelectric field (perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$) having distinctly different\neffects in two altitude regimes. At lower altitudes, where ions are\ndemagnetized and electrons magnetized, and recombination dominantes, a high\nelectric field causes irregularities, plasma turbulence, electron heating,\nslower recombination and ultimately enhanced plasma densities. However, at\nhigher altitudes, where both ions and electrons are magnetized and atomic\noxygen ions cannot recombine directly, the high electric field instead causes\nfrictional heating, a faster production of molecular ions by charge exchange,\nand so a density decrease. The latter enables ducting of radar pulses on closed\nfield lines, in an analogous fashion to inter-hemispheric ducting in the\nEarth's ionosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 13:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

VA SaaS is typically accessed by users using a lightweight\nclient. Because the transmission bandwidth between the client and cloud is\nusually limited and expensive, it brings great benefits to design cloud video\nanalysis algorithms with a limited data transmission requirement. Although\nconsiderable research has been devoted to video analysis, to our best\nknowledge, little of them has paid attention to the transmission bandwidth\nlimitation in SaaS. As the first attempt in this direction, this work\nintroduces a problem of few-frame action recognition, which aims at maintaining\nhigh recognition accuracy, when accessing only a few frames during both\ntraining and test. Unlike previous work that processed dense frames, we present\nTemporal Sequence Distillation (TSD), which distills a long video sequence into\na very short one for transmission. By end-to-end training with 3D CNNs for\nvideo action recognition, TSD learns a compact and discriminative temporal and\nspatial representation of video frames. On Kinetics dataset, TSD+I3D typically\nrequires only 50\\% of the number of frames compared to I3D, a state-of-the-art\nvideo action recognition algorithm, to achieve almost the same accuracies. The\nproposed TSD has three appealing advantages. Firstly, TSD has a lightweight\narchitecture and can be deployed in the client, eg. mobile devices, to produce\ncompressed representative frames to save transmission bandwidth. Secondly, TSD\nsignificantly reduces the computations to run video action recognition with\ncompressed frames on the cloud, while maintaining high recognition accuracies.\nThirdly, TSD can be plugged in as a preprocessing module of any existing 3D\nCNNs. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and characteristics of TSD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 13:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

Competing contributions of both magneto-crystalline anisotropy\nenergy (C-MAE) and magnetic dipolar anisotropy energy (D-MAE) to the MAE, are\ncomputed. Calculated MAEs of these materials are large, being in the order of\n$\\sim$0.1 meV/Cr. Interestingly, we find that the out-of-plane magnetic\nanisotropy is preferred in all the systems except the ML where an in-plane\nmagnetization is favored because here the D-MAE is larger than the C-MAE.\nCrucially, this explains why long-range FM order was observed in all the\nfew-layer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ except the ML because the out-of-plane magnetic\nanisotropy would open a spin-wave gap and thus suppress magnetic fluctuations\nso that long-range FM order could be stabilized at finite temperature. In the\nvisible frequency range, large Kerr rotations up to $\\sim$1.0 deg in these\nmaterials are predicted and they are comparable to that observed in famous MO\nmaterials such as PtMnSb and Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$.

However, it is still elusive how topological\norders can be affected or detected under noises. In this work, we find a\nquantity, termed as the ring degeneracy $\\mathcal{D}$, which is robust under\npure noise to detect both trivial and intrinsic topological orders. The ring\ndegeneracy is defined as the degeneracy of the solutions of the self-consistent\nequations that encode the contraction of the corresponding tensor network(TN).\nFor the $Z_N$ orders, we find that the ring degeneracy satisfies a simple\nrelation $\\mathcal{D} = (N + 1)/2 + d$, with $d = 0$ for odd $N$ and $d = 1/2$\nfor even $N$. Simulations on several non-trivial states (two-dimensional Ising\nmodel, $Z_N$ topological states, and resonating valence bond states) show that\nthe ring degeneracy can tolerate noises up to a strength associated to the gap\nof the TN boundary theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 14:32:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 15:35:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 07:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 15:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

ACT, with its third generation polarization sensitive\narray, Advanced ACTPol, is being used to measure the anisotropies of the CMB in\nfive frequency bands in large areas of the sky ($\\sim 15,000$ $\\rm deg^2$).\nThese measurements are designed to characterize the large scale structure of\nthe universe, test cosmological models and constrain the sum of the neutrino\nmasses. As the sensitivity of these wide surveys increases, the control and\nvalidation of the far sidelobe response becomes increasingly important and is\nparticularly challenging as multiple reflections, spillover, diffraction and\nscattering become difficult to model and characterize at the required levels.\nIn this work, we present a ray trace model of the ACT upper structure which is\nused to describe much of the observed far sidelobe pattern. This model combines\nsecondary mirror spillover measurements with a 3D CAD model based on\nphotogrammetry measurements to simulate the beam of the camera and the comoving\nground shield. This simulation shows qualitative agreement with physical optics\ntools and features observed in far sidelobe measurements. We present this\nmethod as an efficient first-order calculation that, although it does not\ncapture all diffraction effects, informs interactions between the structural\ncomponents of the telescope and the optical path, which can then be combined\nwith more computationally intensive physical optics calculations. This method\ncan be used to predict sidelobe patterns in the design stage of future optical\nsystems such as the Simons Observatory, CCAT-prime, and CMB Stage IV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 14:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

The latter is based on the Statistical Mul- tifragmentation Model\n(SMM), describing the prompt breakup of the source, whereas the particle\nemission from the hot fragments, that decay while traveling away from each\nother, is treated by the Weisskopf-Ewing evaporation model. Since this\ntreatment provides an event by event descrip- tion of the process, in which the\nclassical trajectories of the fragments are followed using molecular dynamics\ntechniques, it allows one to study observables such as two-particle\ncorrelations and infer the extent to which the corresponding observables may\nprovide information on the multifragment production mechanisms.

In this paper, distributed symbolic motion\nplanning for multi-robot systems is developed to address scalability. More\nspecifically, compositional reasoning approaches are developed to decompose the\nglobal planning problem, and atomic propositions for observation,\ncommunication, and control are proposed to address inter-robot collision\navoidance. To improve solution quality and adaptability, a dynamic,\nquantitative, and probabilistic human-to-robot trust model is developed to aid\nthis decomposition. Furthermore, a trust-based real-time switching framework is\nproposed to switch between autonomous and manual motion planning for tradeoffs\nbetween task safety and efficiency. Deadlock- and livelock-free algorithms are\ndesigned to guarantee reachability of goals with a human-in-the-loop.

Various recurrent neural\narchitectures have been designed to mitigate this issue. In order to test these\nstate-of-the-art architectures, there is growing need for rich benchmarking\ndatasets. However, one of the drawbacks of existing datasets is the lack of\nexperimental control with regards to the presence and/or degree of LDDs. This\nlack of control limits the analysis of model performance in relation to the\nspecific challenge posed by LDDs. One way to address this is to use synthetic\ndata having the properties of subregular languages. The degree of LDDs within\nthe generated data can be controlled through the k parameter, length of the\ngenerated strings, and by choosing appropriate forbidden strings. In this\npaper, we explore the capacity of different RNN extensions to model LDDs, by\nevaluating these models on a sequence of SPk synthesized datasets, where each\nsubsequent dataset exhibits a longer degree of LDD. Even though SPk are simple\nlanguages, the presence of LDDs does have significant impact on the performance\nof recurrent neural architectures, thus making them prime candidate in\nbenchmarking tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 15:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

We propose two\nnovel random coding schemes and a polar coding scheme for this noisy strong\ncoordination problem, and derive inner bounds for the respective strong\ncoordination capacity region. The first scheme is a joint coordination-channel\ncoding scheme that utilizes the randomness provided by the DMC to reduce the\namount of local randomness required to generate the sequence of actions at Node\n$Y$. Based on this random coding scheme, we provide a characterization of the\ncapacity region for two special cases of the noisy strong coordination setup,\nnamely, when the actions at Node $Y$ are determined by Node $X$ and when the\nDMC is a deterministic channel. The second scheme exploits separate\ncoordination and channel coding where local randomness is extracted from the\nchannel after decoding. The third scheme is a joint coordination-channel polar\ncoding scheme for strong coordination. We show that polar codes are able to\nachieve the established inner bound to the noisy strong coordination capacity\nregion and thus provide a constructive alternative to a random coding proof.\nOur polar coding scheme also offers a constructive solution to a channel\nsimulation problem where a DMC and shared randomness are employed together to\nsimulate another DMC. Finally, by leveraging the random coding results for this\nproblem, we present an example in which the proposed joint scheme is able to\nstrictly outperform the separate scheme in terms of achievable communication\nrate for the same amount of injected randomness into both systems. Thus, we\nestablish the sub-optimality of the separation of strong coordination and\nchannel coding with respect to the communication rate over the DMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 05:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

For transmission or distribution networks these equations can be\nsimplified into a linear system involving the graph Laplacian and the power\ninput vector. We show, using spectral graph theory, how to solve this system\nefficiently. This spectral approach gives a new geometric view of the network\nand power vector. This formulation yields a Parseval-like relation for the\n$L_2$ norm of the power in the lines. Using this relation as a guide, we show\nthat a small number of eigenvector components of the power vector are enough to\nobtain an estimate of the solution. This would allow fast reconfiguration of\nnetworks and better planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 18:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 15:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Of particular\ninterest is the proper way to determine which nodes of the network should\nreceive external control inputs in order to effectively and efficiently control\nportions of the network. Published methods to accomplish this task either find\na minimal set of driver nodes to guarantee controllability or a larger set of\ndriver nodes which optimizes some control metric. Here, we investigate the\ncontrol of lattice systems which provides analytical insight into the\nrelationship between network structure and controllability. First we derive a\nclosed form expression for the individual elements of the controllability\nGramian of infinite lattice systems. Second, we focus on nearest neighbor\nlattices for which the distance between nodes appears in the expression for the\ncontrollability Gramian. We show that common control energy metrics scale\nexponentially with respect to the maximum distance between a driver node and a\ntarget node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 22:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-24"}

Starting with a general memristive system model, we derive basic\nequations describing the fixed-point attractors and investigate attractors in\nthe dynamics of ideal, threshold-type and second-order memristors, and\nmemristive networks. A memristor potential function is introduced, and it is\nshown that in some cases the attractor identification problem can be mapped to\nthe problem of potential function minimization. Importantly, the fixed-point\nattractors may only exist if the function describing the internal state\ndynamics depends on an internal state variable. Our findings may be used to\ntune the states of analog memristors, and also be relevant to memristive\nsynapses subjected to forward- and back-propagating spikes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:43:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 13:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 22:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 14:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

For instance, variation of illumination\nof light, noise, occlusion, sudden start and stop of moving object, shading\netc,make the object tracking a complex problem not only for dynamic background\nbut also for static background. In this paper we propose a dual approach for\nobject tracking based on optical flow and swarm Intelligence.The optical flow\nbased KLT(Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) tracker, tracks the dominant points of the\ntarget object from first frame to last frame of a video sequence;whereas swarm\nIntelligence based PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) tracker simultaneously\ntracks the boundary information of the target object from second frame to last\nframe of the same video sequence.This dual function of tracking makes the\ntrackers very much robust with respect to the above stated problems. The\nflexibility of our approach is that it can be successfully applicable in\nvariable background as well as static background.We compare the performance of\nthe proposed dual tracking algorithm with several benchmark datasets and obtain\nvery competitive results in general and in most of the cases we obtained\nsuperior results using dual tracking algorithm. We also compare the performance\nof the proposed dual tracker with some existing PSO based algorithms for\ntracking and achieved better results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 14:17:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 06:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}
