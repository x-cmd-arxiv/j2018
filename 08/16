The convolution and\npooling operations are then applied to the mapped item embeddings. In this\npaper, we first examine the typical session-based CNN recommender and show that\nboth the generative model and network architecture are suboptimal when modeling\nlong-range dependencies in the item sequence. To address the issues, we\nintroduce a simple, but very effective generative model that is capable of\nlearning high-level representation from both short- and long-range item\ndependencies. The network architecture of the proposed model is formed of a\nstack of \\emph{holed} convolutional layers, which can efficiently increase the\nreceptive fields without relying on the pooling operation. Another contribution\nis the effective use of residual block structure in recommender systems, which\ncan ease the optimization for much deeper networks.

However, these\nvehicles need to estimate their positions (states) with intrinsic sensing in\ntheir long-term trajectories. In previous studies, autonomous underwater\nvehicles have commonly used vision and range sensors for autonomous state\nestimation. Inspired by the intrinsic sensing and the persistent deployment, we\ninvestigate the localization problem (state estimation) for an inexpensive and\nunderactuated drifting vehicle called a drifter. In this paper, we present a\nlocalization method for the drifter making use of the observations of a\nproprioceptive sensor, i.e., compass. We create the water flow pattern within a\ngiven region from ocean model predictions, develop a stochastic motion model,\nand analyze the persistent water flow behavior. Given a distribution of initial\ndeployment states of the drifter at a particular depth of the water column\nwithin the region and the water flow pattern, our method finds attractors and\ntheir transient groups at the given depth as the persistent behavior of the\nwater flow. A most-likely localized trajectory of the drifter for a sequence of\ncompass observations is generated based on the persistent behavior of the water\nflow and hidden Markov model. Our simulation results based on data from ocean\nmodel predictions substantiate good performance of our proposed localization\nmethod with a low error rate of the state estimation in the long-term\ntrajectory of the drifter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 16:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

The effective\nquarks and gluons encode hot QCD medium effective in terms of their respective\neffective fugacities.

One such problem is the phase retrieval\nproblem, for which proximal operators have been proposed recently. The phase\nretrieval problem commonly refers to the task of recovering a target signal\nbased on the magnitude of linear projections of that signal onto known vectors,\nusually under the presence of noise. A more general problem is the\nmultispectral phase retrieval problem, where sums of these magnitudes are\nobserved instead. In this paper we study the proximal operator for this\nproblem, which appears in applications like X-ray solution scattering. We show\nthat despite its non-convexity, all local minimizers are global minimizers,\nguaranteeing the optimality of simple descent techniques. An efficient linear\ntime exact Newton method is proposed based on the structure of the problem's\nHessian. Initialization criteria are discussed and the computational\nperformance of the proposed algorithm is compared to that of traditional\ndescent methods. The studied proximal operator can be used in a distributed and\nparallel scenarios using an ADMM scheme and allows for exploiting the spectral\ncharacteristics of the problem's measurement matrices, known in many physical\nsensing applications, in a way that is not possible with non-splitted\noptimization algorithms.

Yet previous\ncomputational studies always found a much higher formation energy for cation\ninterstitials than for cation vacancies, which would rule out the interstitial\nmechanism. The conundrum has been resolved via first-principles calculations\ncomparing migration of reduced cations and oxidized ones, in cubic ZrO2, CeO2\nand BaTiO3. In nearly all cases, reduction alone lowers the migration barrier,\nand pronounced lowering results if cation's electrostatic energy at the saddle\npoint decreases. The latter is most effectively realized when a Ti cation is\nallowed to migrate via an empty Ba site thus being fully screened all the way\nby neighboring anions. Since reduction creates oxygen vacancies as well, which\nare highly mobile, we also studied their effect on cation migration, and found\nit only marginally lowers the migration barrier. In several cases, however, a\nlarge synergistic effect between cation reduction and oxygen vacancy is\nrevealed, causing an electron to localize in the saddle-point state at a much\nlower energy than normal, signaling that the saddle point is a negative-U state\nin which the soft environment enables a large electron-phonon interaction that\ncan over-compensate the on-site Coulomb repulsion. These general findings are\nexpected to be applicable to defect-mediated ion migration in most transitional\nmetal oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 17:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-16"}

We introduce a numerical setup incorporating\ncosmological accretion of gas, along with the growth of the halo, based on the\nVan den Bosch model for the average growth of halos as a function of cosmic\ntime. We evolve one-dimensional Lagrangian shells with radiative cooling of the\ngas and heating due to feedback from the gas cooling and moving in toward the\ncenter. A simple Bondi accretion model on to a central black hole is used to\ninclude feedback heating. The setup captures some of the key characteristics of\nspherically symmetric accretion onto the halos: formation of virial shocks\nslightly outside $r_{200}$ and long-term thermal balance in the form of cooling\nand heating cycles. The gas density outside our initial halos at $z=6$ is\nconstrained by requiring that the baryon fraction within the virial radius for\nnon-radiative evolution be equal to the universal value at almost all times.\nThe total mass in the cold phase (taken to be $\\sim 10^4$ K) within $40$ kpc is\ntracked as a function of the halo mass and redshift. We compare the evolution\nof the cold gas mass to the observed stellar-mass versus halo mass relations,\nfollowing which, we can constrain the feedback energy required for different\nhalo masses and redshifts. We also compare and match the hot gas density and\ntemperature profiles for our most massive halo to those of clusters observed\nupto redshift $2$.

Coarse gradient is generally not a gradient of any function but an\nartificial ascent direction. The weight update of BCGD goes by coarse gradient\ncorrection of a weighted average of the full precision weights and their\nquantization (the so-called blending), which yields sufficient descent in the\nobjective value and thus accelerates the training.

Agriculture, transportation, and energy are\nsectors that depend on high-resolution weather models, which typically consume\nmany hours of large High Performance Computing (HPC) systems to deliver timely\nresults. Many users cannot afford to run the desired resolution and are forced\nto use low resolution output. One simple solution is to interpolate results for\nvisualization.

However, these approaches fail to capture\nthe redundant information and patterns in the low-resolution input that could\nhelp improve the quality of prediction. In this paper, we propose and evaluate\na strategy based on a deep neural network to learn a high-resolution\nrepresentation from low-resolution predictions using weather forecast as a\npractical use case.

Electromagnetic waves in the electron cyclotron\nrange of frequencies are unsuitable for directly heating such plasmas due to\ntheir reduced accessibility. However, mode-conversion of the extraordinary wave\nto the electron Bernstein wave (X-B mode-conversion) at the upper hybrid\nresonance makes it possible to efficiently couple externally-launched\nelectromagnetic wave energy into an overdense plasma core. Traditional\nmode-conversion models describe an X-mode wave propagating in a potential\ncontaining two cutoffs that bracket a single wave resonance. Often, however,\nthe mode-conversion region is in the edge, where turbulent fluctuations and\nblobs can generate abrupt cutoffs and scattering of the incident X-mode wave.\nWe present a new framework for studying the X-B mode-conversion which makes the\ninclusion of these fluctuations analytically tractable. In the new approach,\nthe high-field cutoff is modelled as an infinite barrier, which manifests as a\nboundary condition applied to a wave equation involving only one cutoff\nadjacent to the resonance on the low-field side. The new model reproduces the\nmain features of the previous approach, yet is more suitable for analyzing\nexperimental observations and extrapolating to higher dimensions. We then\ndevelop an analytical estimate for the effect of small-amplitude,\nquasi-monochromatic density fluctuations on the X-B mode-conversion efficiency\nusing perturbation theory. We find that Bragg backscattering of the launched\nX-mode wave reduces the mode-conversion efficiency significantly when the\nfluctuation wavenumber is resonant with the wavenumber of the incident X-mode\nwave. These analytical results are corroborated by numerically integrating the\nmode-conversion equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 20:37:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 17:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

We analyze imaging data and\ncorresponding adaptive optics telemetry, observing conditions, and other\nmetadata over a three year time period to characterize the performance of the\ninstrument and predict the detection limits of future observations. We\nsystematically process images from 359 observations of 304 unique stars to\nsubtract residual starlight (i.e., the coronagraphic point spread function) of\nthe target star using two methods: angular differential imaging (ADI) and\nreference star differential imaging (RDI). We find that for the typical\nparallactic angle (PA) rotation of our dataset ($\\sim$10$^{\\circ}$), RDI\nprovides gains over ADI for angular separations smaller than\n0.25$^{\\prime\\prime}$. Furthermore, we find a power-law relation between the\nangular separation from the host star and the minimum PA rotation required for\nADI to outperform RDI, with a power-law index of -1.18$\\pm$0.08. Finally, we\nuse random forest models to estimate ADI and RDI post-processed detection\nlimits a priori. These models, which we provide publicly on a website, explain\n70%-80% of the variance in ADI detection limits and 30%-50% of the variance in\nRDI detection limits. Averaged over a range of angular separations, our models\npredict both ADI and RDI contrast to within a factor of 2. These results\nilluminate important factors in high-contrast imaging observations with the\nNIRC2 vortex coronagraph, help improve observing strategies, and inform future\nupgrades to the hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 22:25:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Stochastic models are typically used when the\ncounts of the molecules are low, whereas deterministic models are used when the\ncounts are in high abundance. In 2011, the notion of `tiers' was introduced to\nstudy the long time behavior of deterministically modeled reaction networks\nthat are weakly reversible and have a single linkage class. This `tier' based\nargument was analytical in nature. Later, in 2014, the notion of a strongly\nendotactic network was introduced in order to generalize the previous results\nfrom weakly reversible networks with a single linkage class to this wider\nfamily of networks. The point of view of this later work was more geometric and\nalgebraic in nature. The notion of strongly endotactic networks was later used\nin 2018 to prove a large deviation principle for a class of stochastically\nmodeled reaction networks.\n  We provide an analytical characterization of strongly endotactic networks in\nterms of tier structures. By doing so, we shed light on the connection between\nthe two points of view, and also make available a new proof technique for the\nstudy of strongly endotactic networks. We show the power of this new technique\nin two distinct ways. First, we demonstrate how the main previous results\nrelated to strongly endotactic networks, both for the deterministic and\nstochastic modeling choices, can be quickly obtained from our characterization.\nSecond, we demonstrate how new results can be obtained by proving that a\nsub-class of strongly endotactic networks, when modeled stochastically, is\npositive recurrent. Finally, and similarly to recent independent work by Agazzi\nand Mattingly, we provide an example which closes a conjecture in the negative\nby showing that stochastically modeled strongly endotactic networks can be\ntransient (and even explosive).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 02:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 09:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

Recently, learning-based (e.g.,\ndeep) iterative methods have been empirically shown to be useful for these\nproblems. Nevertheless, integrating learnable structures into iterations is\nstill a laborious process, which can only be guided by intuitions or empirical\ninsights. Moreover, there is a lack of rigorous analysis about the convergence\nbehaviors of these reimplemented iterations, and thus the significance of such\nmethods is a little bit vague. This paper moves beyond these limits and\nproposes Flexible Iterative Modularization Algorithm (FIMA), a generic and\nprovable paradigm for nonconvex inverse problems.

These weights incorporate the generalized propensity scores to\nbalance the weighted covariate distribution of each treatment group, all\nweighted toward a common pre-specified target population. The class of\nbalancing weights include several existing approaches such as the inverse\nprobability weights and trimming weights as special cases.

To prove this, we examine the generic band topology of two\ndimensional real fermions in systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$\nsymmetry. The Euler class is an integer topological invariant classifying real\ntwo band systems. We show that a two-band system with a nonzero Euler class\ncannot have an $I_{ST}$-symmetric Wannier representation. Moreover, a two-band\nsystem with the Euler class $e_{2}$ has band crossing points whose total\nwinding number is equal to $-2e_2$. Thus the conventional Nielsen-Ninomiya\ntheorem fails in systems with a nonzero Euler class. We propose that the\ntopological phase transition between two insulators carrying distinct Euler\nclasses can be described in terms of the pair creation and annihilation of\nvortices accompanied by winding number changes across Dirac strings. When the\nnumber of bands is bigger than two, there is a $Z_{2}$ topological invariant\nclassifying the band topology, that is, the second Stiefel Whitney class\n($w_2$). Two bands with an even (odd) Euler class turn into a system with\n$w_2=0$ ($w_2=1$) when additional trivial bands are added. Although the\nnontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney class remains robust against adding trivial\nbands, it does not impose a Wannier obstruction when the number of bands is\nbigger than two.

We consider two sectors for Skerrmions.\nIn the sector with non-zero baryon charge, Skerrmions are akin to the known\nSkyrme solutions on the Schwarzschild background. These `topological'\nconfigurations reduce to flat spacetime Skyrmions in a vanishing BH mass limit;\nmoreoever, they never become \"small\" perturbations on the Kerr background: the\nnon-linearities of the Skyrme model are crucial for all such Skerrmions. In the\nnon-topological sector, on the other hand, Skerrmions have no analogue on the\nSchwarzschild background. Non-topological Skerrmions carry not baryon charge\nand bifurcate from a subset of Kerr solutions defining an existence line.\nTherein the appropriate truncation of the Skyrme model yield a linear scalar\nfield theory containing a complex plus a real field, both massive and\ndecoupled, and the Skerrmions reduce to the known stationary scalar clouds\naround Kerr BHs. Moreover, non-topological Skerrmions trivialise in the\nvanishing BH mass limit. We then discuss the backreaction of these Skerrmions,\nthat yield rotating BHs with synchronised Skyrme hair, which continously\nconnect to the Kerr solution (self-gravitating Skyrmions) in the\nnon-topological (topological) sector.

Most traditional 3DMM fitting methods fail to reconstruct\nan accurate model because face shape fitting is a difficult non-linear\noptimization problem. In this paper we show that landmark weighting is\ninstrumental to improve the accuracy of shape reconstruction and propose a\nnovel 3D Morphable Model Fitting method. Different from previous works that\ntreat all landmarks equally, we take into consideration the estimated errors\nfor each pair of 2D and 3D corresponding landmarks. The landmark points are\nweighted in the optimization cost function based on these errors. Obviously,\nthese landmarks have different semantics because they locate on different\nfacial components. In the context of the solution of fitting is approximated,\nthere are deviations in landmarks matching. However, these landmarks with\ndifferent semantics have different effects on reconstructing 3D faces. Thus, it\nis necessary to consider each landmark individually. To our knowledge, we are\nthe first to analyze each feature point for 3D face reconstruction by 3DMM. The\nweight is adaptive with the estimation residuals of landmarks.

Chiral amplification of a randomly perturbed\nracemic mixture of chiral molecules is a well-accepted prerequisite for all\nroutes to biological homochirality. Some models have suggested that such\namplification occurred due to asymmetric discrimination of chiral biotic or\nprebiotic molecules when they adsorbed onto crystalline surfaces. While chiral\namplification has been demonstrated on surfaces of both chiral and achiral\ncrystals, the mechanism that would produce an enantiomeric imbalance in the\nchiral surfaces themselves has not been addressed. Here we report strong chiral\namplification in the colloidal synthesis of intrinsically chiral lanthanide\nphosphate nanocrystals, quantitatively measured via the circularly polarized\nluminescence of the lanthanide ions within the nanocrystals. The amplification\ninvolves spontaneous symmetry breaking into either left- or right-handed\nnanocrystals below a critical temperature. Furthermore, chiral tartaric acid\nmolecules in the solution act as an external chiral field, sensitively\ndirecting the amplified nanocrystal handedness through a discontinuous\ntransition between left- and right-handed excess. These characteristics suggest\na conceptual framework for chiral amplification, based on the statistical\nthermodynamics of critical phenomena, which we use to quantitatively account\nfor the observations.

Here, we identify EELRs by the presence\nof the [NeV] 3426\\AA\\ emission line, which, like [OII], is not strongly excited\nin the inner regions of AGN, but is a prominent emission line in the lower\ndensity EELRs. Critically, unlike [OII], [NeV] is not excited by star\nformation. Therefore, when strong [NeV] is present in an AGN spectrum, the flux\nfrom the EELR is not negligible, implying the [OII] flux is contaminated by\nemission from the EELR, and is not a good measure of star formation. After\nremoving objects with EELRs identified by [NeV], the [OII] flux in the host\ngalaxies of radio-loud AGN is found to be higher than that within radio-quiet\nAGN, which could either indicate higher star-formation rates, or the presence\nof moderate-velocity shocks. Being mindful of EELRs for upcoming large-area\nspectroscopic surveys, particularly those tied to radio continuum surveys, will\nbe important for determining star formation rates in AGN host galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 11:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-17"}

One of the main\nchallenges is to devise a joint regularization functional that conveys the\nspatial correlations or structural similarity between the fields while at the\nsame time permitting scalable and efficient solvers for the joint inverse\nproblem.

The certificate verification in SSL/TLS\nimplementations is vital and may become the weak link in the whole network\necosystem. In previous works, some research focused on the automated testing of\ncertificate verification, and the main approaches rely on generating massive\ncertificates through randomly combining parts of seed certificates for fuzzing.\nAlthough the generated certificates could meet the semantic constraints, the\ncost is quite heavy, and the performance is limited due to the randomness.

DRLGENCERT accepts ordinary\ncertificates as input and outputs newly generated certificates which could\ntrigger discrepancies with high efficiency. Benefited by the deep reinforcement\nlearning, when generating certificates, our framework could choose the best\nnext action according to the result of a previous modification, instead of\nsimple random combinations. At the same time, we developed a set of new\ntechniques to support the overall design, like new feature extraction method\nfor X.509 certificates, fine-grained differential testing, and so forth.

The space\ncomplexity was later reduced by Jowhari, Sa\\u{g}lam, and Tardos to roughly\n$O(\\nu^{-p} \\log^2 n \\log \\delta^{-1})$ for $p \\in (0,2)$, which tightly\nmatches the $\\Omega(\\log^2 n \\log \\delta^{-1})$ lower bound in terms of $n$ and\n$\\delta$, but is loose in terms of $\\nu$.\n  Given these nearly tight bounds, it is perhaps surprising that no lower bound\nexists in terms of $\\nu$---not even a bound of $\\Omega(\\nu^{-1})$ is known. In\nthis paper, we explain this phenomenon by demonstrating the existence of an\n$O(\\log^2 n \\log \\delta^{-1})$-bit perfect $L_p$ sampler for $p \\in (0,2)$.\nThis shows that $\\nu$ need not factor into the space of an $L_p$ sampler, which\ncloses the complexity of the problem for this range of $p$. For $p=2$, our\nbound is $O(\\log^3 n \\log \\delta^{-1})$-bits, which matches the prior best\nknown upper bound in terms of $n,\\delta$, but has no dependence on $\\nu$. For\n$p<2$, our bound holds in the random oracle model, matching the lower bounds in\nthat model. Moreover, we show that our algorithm can be derandomized with only\na $O((\\log \\log n)^2)$ blow-up in the space (and no blow-up for $p=2$). Our\nderandomization technique is general, and can be used to derandomize a large\nclass of linear sketches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 14:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 18:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 14:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

Existing DPM algorithms neglect\ntemporal dependencies among measurements and make parametric assumptions about\nbiomarker trajectories. In addition, they do not model multiple biomarkers\njointly and need to align subjects' trajectories. In this paper, recurrent\nneural networks (RNNs) are utilized to address these issues. However, in many\ncases, longitudinal cohorts contain incomplete data, which hinders the\napplication of standard RNNs and requires a pre-processing step such as\nimputation of the missing values. We, therefore, propose a generalized training\nrule for the most widely used RNN architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks, that can handle missing values in both target and predictor\nvariables. This algorithm is applied for modeling the progression of\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers. The\nresults show that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves a lower mean absolute\nerror for prediction of measurements across all considered MRI biomarkers\ncompared to using standard LSTM networks with data imputation or using a\nregression-based DPM method. Moreover, applying linear discriminant analysis to\nthe biomarkers' values predicted by the proposed algorithm results in a larger\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for clinical\ndiagnosis of AD compared to the same alternatives, and the AUC is comparable to\nstate-of-the-art AUCs from a recent cross-sectional medical image\nclassification challenge.

For this\nstudy, we developed a method using the coronal magnetic field as a tracer. The\nfield in a spherical layer from the base of the corona up to the source surface\nwas determined from photospheric measurements. Calculations were performed for\n14 heliocentric distances from the base of the corona up to 2.45 solar radii\nand from the equator to about 75 degrees of latitude at 5 degrees steps. For\neach day, we calculated three components, which were then used to obtain the\nfield strength. The coronal rotation periods were determined by the periodogram\nmethod for all distances and latitudes under consideration. The variations in\nthe coronal rotation during the time interval 1976-2004 were as follows: the\ngradient of differential rotation decreased with the increase of heliocentric\ndistance; the rotation remaining differential even in the vicinity of the\nsource surface. The largest rotation rates were recorded at the cycle minimum\nat small heights in the corona. The lowest rotation rate was observed at the\nmiddle of the ascending branch at large distances. At the minimum of the cycle,\nthe differential rotation is most clearly pronounced, especially at small\nheliocentric distances. As the distance increases, the differential gradient\ndecreases in all phases. The results based on magnetic data and on the\nbrightness of the coronal green line 530.3nm FeXIV used earlier show a\nsatisfactory agreement. Since the rotation of the magnetic field at the\ncorresponding heights in the corona is probably determined by the conditions in\nthe field generation region, an opportunity arises to use this method for\ndiagnostics of differential rotation in the subphotospheric layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 14:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Considering the complicated\nradiation surroundings in the clusters, where the star formed, the\nproto-planetary discs survive in different lifetimes due to flyby events. In\nthis paper, we mainly focus on the disc around a T Tauri star, which encounters\nwith another main-sequence star with different temperatures in hyperbolic\norbits with different peri-center distances, eccentricities and inclinations.\nWe find the criterion for gap-opening due to photo-evaporation of central star\nafter the flyby event. A gap is opened in the late stage of gas disc, and\ninduce that the gap only influence the planet formation and migration\nlimitedly. If the flyby orbit has a moderate value of peri-center distance,\nwhich weakly depends on the eccentricity and inclination, the external\nphoto-evaporation lead to a maximum mass loss during the flyby event.

The outburst profile, as observed with SWIFT-XRT, shows a typical\n`q'-shape in the Hardness Intensity Diagram (HID). Based on the spectral and\ntemporal evolution of the different parameters, we are able to identify all the\nspectral states in the q-profile of HID and the Hardness-RMS diagram (HRD).\nBoth XRT and NuSTAR observations show an evolution of low frequency Quasi\nperiodic oscillations (QPOs) during the low hard and hard intermediate states\nof the outburst rising phase. We also find mHz QPOs along- with distinct\ncoherent class variabilities (heartbeat oscillations) with different\ntimescales, similar to the $\\rho$-class (observed in GRS 1915+105).\nPhenomenological modelling of the broad-band XRT and NuSTAR spectra also\nreveals the evolution of high energy cut-off and presence of reflection from\nionized material during the rising phase of the outburst. Further, we conduct\nthe modelling of X-ray spectra of SWIFT and NuSTAR in 0.5 - 79 keV to\nunderstand the accretion flow dynamics based on two component flow model.

In particular, recent advances in image\ncaptioning use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to alleviate the \"exposure\nbias\" during training: ground-truth subsequence is exposed in every step\nprediction, which introduces bias in test when only predicted subsequence is\nseen. However, existing RL-based image captioning methods only focus on the\nlanguage policy while not the visual policy (e.g., visual attention), and thus\nfail to capture the visual context that are crucial for compositional reasoning\nsuch as visual relationships (e.g., \"man riding horse\") and comparisons (e.g.,\n\"smaller cat\"). To fill the gap, we propose a Context-Aware Visual Policy\nnetwork (CAVP) for sequence-level image captioning.

In the differential geometrical approach in statistics\n(information geometry), dually flat spaces play a key role. In a dually flat\nspace, there exist dual affine coordinate systems and strictly convex functions\ncalled potential and a canonical divergence is naturally introduced as a\nfunction of the affine coordinates and potentials. The canonical divergence\nsatisfies a relational expression called triangular relation. This can be\nregarded as a generalization of the law of cosines in Euclidean space.\n  In this paper, we newly introduce two kinds of divergences. The first\ndivergence is a function of affine coordinates and it is consistent with the\nJeffreys divergence for exponential or mixture families. For this divergence,\nwe show that more relational equations and theorems similar to Euclidean space\nhold in addition to the law of cosines. The second divergences are functions of\npotentials and they are consistent with the Bhattacharyya distance for\nexponential families and are consistent with the Jensen-Shannon divergence for\nmixture families respectively.

Laser process parameters i.e. laser fluence and number of pulses were used\nto perform the experiment and after different optical, microstructural,\nelemental, microhardness and surface topography analysis of the laser ablated\nzone was performed. The parametric window selected for the excimer laser\ncleaning were laser fluence (200-400 mJ/cm2), repetition rate 4 Hz and number\nof pulses (60-300). It was observed that excimer laser is very effective in the\ncleaning of black encrustation having 6 wt. % of sulphur from the surface\nwithout any significant removal of the silver substrate. The fluence value of\n260.48 mJ/cm2 was observed as above threshold value for removal of sulphide\nfrom the encrusted surface while a fluence of 384.85 mJ/cm2 and 220 pulses\nshowed the maximum removal of sulphur encrustation (0.38 wt. % of sulphur\nremaining).

The development presented here includes\nan examination of the character of the bend-twist tensor, Weingarten's theorem,\nBurgers and Frank vectors, continuous dislocation and disclination density\ntensors, and the dualism between geometry and statics of CDT based on couple\nstress theory (CST). Then, by using Consistent Couple Stress Theory (C-CST),\nthe new C-CDT is derived in a totally systematic manner. In this development,\nthe geometry of C-CDT is dual to the statics formulation in C-CST. Previously,\nthe fundamental step in the creation of C-CST was recognizing the\nskew-symmetric character of the couple-stress tensor, which requires the\nskew-symmetrical part of the bend-twist tensor to be the additional measure of\ndeformation in size-dependent continuum mechanics. Via Weingarten's theorem and\narguments from C-CST, we establish that in defect theory the dislocation\ndensity tensor must be skew-symmetric and thus can be represented by an\nequivalent dislocation density vector. In addition, we investigate the\ncharacter of a classical version of C-CDT with unexpected consequences. For\nfull consistency, there can be no continuous dislocation density tensor within\nclassical continuum mechanics, and the continuous disclination density tensor\nbecomes symmetric. This clearly is analogous to the absence of couple-stresses\nand the symmetry of force-stresses in classical continuum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 20:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

With the advent of big data, a number of\nartificial intelligence techniques such as back propagation, support vector\nmachine have been used to predict the load of the next day. Nevertheless, due\nto the noise of raw data and the randomness of power load, forecasting errors\nof existing approaches are relatively large. In this study, a short-term load\nforecasting method is proposed on the basis of empirical mode decomposition and\nlong short-term memory networks, the parameters of which are optimized by a\nparticle swarm optimization algorithm. Essentially, empirical mode\ndecomposition can decompose the original time series of historical data into\nrelatively stationary components and long short-term memory network is able to\nemphasize as well as model the timing of data, the joint use of which is\nexpected to effectively apply the characteristics of data itself, so as to\nimprove the predictive accuracy. The effectiveness of this research is\nexemplified on a realistic data set, the experimental results of which show\nthat the proposed method has higher forecasting accuracy and applicability, as\ncompared with existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 08:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}
