Most existing methods detect vehicles with regular\nrectangle boxes and fail to offer the orientation of vehicles. However, the\norientation information is crucial for several practical applications, such as\nthe trajectory and motion estimation of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel deep network, called rotatable region-based residual network (R$^3$-Net),\nto detect multi-oriented vehicles in aerial images and videos. More specially,\nR$^3$-Net is utilized to generate rotatable rectangular target boxes in a half\ncoordinate system. First, we use a rotatable region proposal network (R-RPN) to\ngenerate rotatable region of interests (R-RoIs) from feature maps produced by a\ndeep convolutional neural network. Here, a proposed batch averaging rotatable\nanchor (BAR anchor) strategy is applied to initialize the shape of vehicle\ncandidates. Next, we propose a rotatable detection network (R-DN) for the final\nclassification and regression of the R-RoIs. In R-DN, a novel rotatable\nposition sensitive pooling (R-PS pooling) is designed to keep the position and\norientation information simultaneously while downsampling the feature maps of\nR-RoIs. In our model, R-RPN and R-DN can be trained jointly. We test our\nnetwork on two open vehicle detection image datasets, namely DLR 3K Munich\nDataset and VEDAI Dataset, demonstrating the high precision and robustness of\nour method. In addition, further experiments on aerial videos show the good\ngeneralization capability of the proposed method and its potential for vehicle\ntracking in aerial videos.

Numerous studies have shown that nearly all\nof the largest solar flares originate in delta-spots, making the understanding\nof these structures a fundamental step in predicting space weather. Despite\ntheir important influence on the space environment, surprisingly little is\nunderstood about the origin and behavior of delta-spots. In this paper, we\nperform a systematic study of the behavior of emerging flux ropes to test a\ntheoretical model for the formation of delta-spots: the kink instability of\nemerging flux ropes. We simulated the emergence of highly twisted,\nkink-unstable flux ropes from the convection zone into the corona, and compared\ntheir photospheric properties to those of emerged weakly twisted, kink-stable\nflux ropes. We show that the photospheric manifestations of the emergence of\nhighly twisted flux ropes closely match the observed properties of delta-spots,\nand we discuss the resulting implications for observations.

One way\nto achieve this is to constrain the predictions to be invariant to\ntransformations on the input that are known to be irrelevant (e.g.\ntranslation). Commonly, this is done through data augmentation, where the\ntraining set is enlarged by applying hand-crafted transformations to the\ninputs. We argue that invariances should instead be incorporated in the model\nstructure, and learned using the marginal likelihood, which correctly rewards\nthe reduced complexity of invariant models. We demonstrate this for Gaussian\nprocess models, due to the ease with which their marginal likelihood can be\nestimated. Our main contribution is a variational inference scheme for Gaussian\nprocesses containing invariances described by a sampling procedure.

Yes, it LARNNs. The\nLARNN uses attention on its past cell state values for a limited window size\n$k$. The formulas are also derived from the Batch Normalized LSTM (BN-LSTM)\ncell and the Transformer Network for its Multi-Head Attention Mechanism. The\nMulti-Head Attention Mechanism is used inside the cell such that it can query\nits own $k$ past values with the attention window. This has the effect of\naugmenting the rank of the tensor with the attention mechanism, such that the\ncell can perform complex queries to question its previous inner memories, which\nshould augment the long short-term effect of the memory. With a clever trick,\nthe LARNN cell with attention can be easily used inside a loop on the cell\nstate, just like how any other Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cell can be\nlooped linearly through time series. This is due to the fact that its state,\nwhich is looped upon throughout time steps within time series, stores the inner\nstates in a \"first in, first out\" queue which contains the $k$ most recent\nstates and on which it is easily possible to add static positional encoding\nwhen the queue is represented as a tensor. This neural architecture yields\nbetter results than the vanilla LSTM cells. It can obtain results of 91.92% for\nthe test accuracy, compared to the previously attained 91.65% using vanilla\nLSTM cells. Note that this is not to compare to other research, where up to\n93.35% is obtained, but costly using 18 LSTM cells rather than with 2 to 3\ncells as analyzed here. Finally, an interesting discovery is made, such that\nadding activation within the multi-head attention mechanism's linear layers can\nyield better results in the context researched hereto.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 16:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-17"}

Conversely,\nwe do not observe this behavior when the natural frequencies are very\ndissimilar.

The leading theory to\ndate, the magnetorotational instability, which redistributes angular momentum\nwithin the disk, is increasingly questioned, and magnetothermal disk winds,\nwhich remove angular momentum from the disk, have emerged as an alternative\ntheoretical solution.

Here, we introduce the\nconcept of symmetry enforced fractonicity, in which particles are fractons in\nthe presence of a global symmetry, but are free to move in its absence. A\nsimple example is dislocation defects in a two-dimensional crystal, which are\nrestricted to move only along their Burgers vector due to particle number\nconservation. Utilizing a recently developed dual rank-2 tensor gauge\ndescription of elasticity, we show that accounting for their symmetry enforced\none-dimensional nature of dislocation motion dramatically alters the structure\nof quantum crystal melting phase transitions. We show that, at zero\ntemperature, sufficiently strong quantum fluctuations of the crystal lattice\nfavor the formation of a super-solid phase that spontaneously breaks the\nsymmetry enforcing fractonicity of defects. The defects can then condense to\ndrive the crystal into a super-nematic phase via a phase transition in the\n$2+1d$ XY universality class to drive a melting phase transition of the crystal\nto a nematic phase. This scenario contrasts the standard Halperin-Nelson\nscenario for thermal melting of $2d$ solids in which dislocations can\nproliferate via a single continuous thermal phase transition. We comment on the\napplication of these results to other scenarios such as vortex lattice melting\nat a magnetic field induced superconductor-insulator transition, and quantum\nmelting of charge density waves of stripes in a metal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 19:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

The delocalization of\ninformation under many-body dynamics has been dubbed scrambling and\nout-of-time-order correlators were proposed to probe this behavior. In this\nwork we investigate the time-evolution of tripartite information as a natural\noperator-independent measure of scrambling, which quantifies to which extent\nthe initially localized information can only be recovered by global\nmeasurements. Studying the dynamics of quantum lattice models with tunable\nintegrability breaking we demonstrate that in contrast to quadratic models\ngeneric interacting systems scramble information irrespective of the chosen\npartitioning of the Hilbert space, which justifies the characterization as\nscrambler. Without interactions the dynamics of tripartite information in\nmomentum space reveals unambiguously the absence of scrambling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 19:08:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 18:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 17:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

This development is driven by rapid improvements in automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR), which now performs on par with human listening in\nmany tasks. These improvements base on an ongoing evolution of DNNs as the\ncomputational core of ASR. However, recent research results show that DNNs are\nvulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which allow attackers to force the\ntranscription into a malicious output.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial examples based on\npsychoacoustic hiding. Our attack exploits the characteristics of DNN-based ASR\nsystems, where we extend the original analysis procedure by an additional\nbackpropagation step. We use this backpropagation to learn the degrees of\nfreedom for the adversarial perturbation of the input signal, i.e., we apply a\npsychoacoustic model and manipulate the acoustic signal below the thresholds of\nhuman perception. To further minimize the perceptibility of the perturbations,\nwe use forced alignment to find the best fitting temporal alignment between the\noriginal audio sample and the malicious target transcription. These extensions\nallow us to embed an arbitrary audio input with a malicious voice command that\nis then transcribed by the ASR system, with the audio signal remaining barely\ndistinguishable from the original signal. In an experimental evaluation, we\nattack the state-of-the-art speech recognition system Kaldi and determine the\nbest performing parameter and analysis setup for different types of input. Our\nresults show that we are successful in up to 98% of cases with a computational\neffort of fewer than two minutes for a ten-second audio file.

Despite the advancements and impressive achievements\nof machine learning, it has been shown that learning algorithms can be\ncompromised by attackers both at training and test time. Machine learning\nsystems are especially vulnerable to adversarial examples where small\nperturbations added to the original data points can produce incorrect or\nunexpected outputs in the learning algorithms at test time. Mitigation of these\nattacks is hard as adversarial examples are difficult to detect. Existing\nrelated work states that the security of machine learning systems against\nadversarial examples can be weakened when feature selection is applied to\nreduce the systems' complexity. In this paper, we empirically disprove this\nidea, showing that the relative distortion that the attacker has to introduce\nto succeed in the attack is greater when the target is using a reduced set of\nfeatures. We also show that the minimal adversarial examples differ\nstatistically more strongly from genuine examples with a lower number of\nfeatures. However, reducing the feature count can negatively impact the\nsystem's performance. We illustrate the trade-off between security and accuracy\nwith specific examples. We propose a design methodology to evaluate the\nsecurity of machine learning classifiers with embedded feature selection\nagainst adversarial examples crafted using different attack strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 23:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-20"}

We train a four-layer neural\nnetwork including a convolutional layer to recognize the relationship between\nthe air holes' displacements and the Q factors using the prepared dataset.\nAfter the training, the neural network becomes able to estimate the Q factors\nfrom the air holes' displacements with an error of 13% in standard deviation.\nCrucially, the trained neural network can estimate the gradient of the Q factor\nwith respect to the air holes' displacements very quickly based on\nback-propagation. A nanocavity structure with an extremely high Q factor of\n1.58 x 10^9 is successfully obtained by optimizing the positions of 50 air\nholes over ~10^6 iterations, having taken advantage of the very fast evaluation\nof the gradient in high-dimensional parameter space.

More importantly, we have\naddressed two major shortcomings of the original ECSIM algorithm: there is no\nmechanism to enforce Gauss's law and there is no mechanism to reduce the\nnumerical oscillations of the electric field. A classical approach to satisfy\nGauss's law is to modify the electric field and its divergence using either an\nelliptic or a parabolic/hyperbolic correction based on the Generalized Lagrange\nMultiplier method. This correction, however, violates the energy conservation\nproperty, and the oscillations related to the finite grid instability reappear\nin the modified ECSIM scheme. We invented a new alternative approach: the\nparticle positions are modified instead of the electric field in the correction\nstep. Displacing the particles slightly does not change the energy conservation\nproperty, while it can satisfy Gauss's law by changing the charge density.

To address the problem\nof misspecification in this practice, we propose an easy-to-implement\nsemiparametric estimation framework with parametric copula and nonparametric\nmarginal distributions. We establish asymptotic theory, including root-n\nnormality, for the sieve maximum likelihood estimators that can be used to\nconduct inference on the individual structural parameters and the average\ntreatment effect (ATE). In order to show the practical relevance of the\nproposed framework, we conduct a sensitivity analysis via extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulation exercises. The results suggest that the estimates of the parameters,\nespecially the ATE, are sensitive to parametric specification, while\nsemiparametric estimation exhibits robustness to underlying data generating\nprocesses. We then provide an empirical illustration where we estimate the\neffect of health insurance on doctor visits. In this paper, we also show that\nthe absence of excluded instruments may result in identification failure, in\ncontrast to what some practitioners believe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 08:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 04:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

An initial sample of 452 CCs are\nextracted from the literature with spectroscopically derived iron abundances.\nReddening values, pulsation periods, and mean magnitudes are taken from the\nliterature.\n  Based on nine CCs with a goodness-of-fit (GOF) statistic <8 and with an\naccurate non-Gaia parallax, a parallax zero-point offset of -0.049 +- 0.018 mas\nis derived.

Excluding first overtone and multi-mode\ncepheids and applying some other criteria reduces the sample to about 200\nstars.\n  The derived PL(Z) relations depend strongly on the parallax zero-point\noffset. The slope of the PL relation is found to be different from the\nrelations in the LMC at the 3 sigma level.

Here, we\nhave constructed a free-space QKD system which can implement BB84, six-state,\nand RFI-QKD protocols, and compared their performances under the reference\nframe rotation and fluctuation. With the theoretical analysis and experimental\ndata, we have successfully verified the robustness of RFI-QKD protocol over\nother QKD protocols in the presence of reference frame rotation and\nfluctuation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 09:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Even for an idealized situation,\nthe combined constraints on space-charge and spontaneous emission put strong\nlimits on sustaining the quantum regime over several gain lengths. Guided by\nthese results we propose to shift the focus towards seeded Quantum FELs instead\nof continuing to aim for self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). Moreover,\nwe point out the necessity of a rigorous quantum theory for spontaneous\nemission as well as for space-charge in order to identify possible loopholes in\nour line of argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 11:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The commonly used discrete\nordinates (S$_N$) method suffers from ray effects which result from a break in\nrotational symmetry from the finite set of directions chosen by S$_N$. The\nspherical harmonics (P$_N$) equations, on the other hand, preserve rotational\nsymmetry, but can produce negative particle densities. The discrete ordinates\n(S$_N$) method, in turn, by construction ensures non-negative particle\ndensities.\n  In this paper we present a modified version of the S$_N$ method, the rotated\nS$_N$ (rS$_N$) method. Compared to S$_N$, we add a rotation and interpolation\nstep for the angular quadrature points and the respective function values after\nevery time step. Thereby, the number of directions on which the solution\nevolves is effectively increased and ray effects are mitigated. Solution values\non rotated ordinates are computed by an interpolation step. Implementation\ndetails are provided and in our experiments the rotation/interpolation step\nonly adds 5% to 10% to the runtime of the S$_N$ method. We apply the rS$_N$\nmethod to the line-source and a lattice test case, both being prone to\nray-effects. Ray effects are reduced significantly, even for small numbers of\nquadrature points.

First, we revisit the seminal assignment algorithm\nby Kuhn and Munkres which we specifically adapt to the problem of matching\npersistence diagrams in an efficient way. Second, we propose an extension of\nthe Wasserstein metric that significantly improves the geometrical stability of\nthe matching of domain-embedded persistence pairs.

Critical trajectories are constructed by associating successively\nmatched persistence pairs over time. Merging and splitting events are detected\nwith a geometrical threshold in a post-processing stage.

We developed a method to automatically detect\nmitotic figures in breast cancer tissue sections based on convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). Application of CNNs to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained\nhistological tissue sections is hampered by: (1) noisy and expensive reference\nstandards established by pathologists, (2) lack of generalization due to\nstaining variation across laboratories, and (3) high computational requirements\nneeded to process gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this paper, we\npresent a method to train and evaluate CNNs to specifically solve these issues\nin the context of mitosis detection in breast cancer WSIs. First, by combining\nimage analysis of mitotic activity in phosphohistone-H3 (PHH3) restained slides\nand registration, we built a reference standard for mitosis detection in entire\nH&E WSIs requiring minimal manual annotation effort. Second, we designed a data\naugmentation strategy that creates diverse and realistic H&E stain variations\nby modifying the hematoxylin and eosin color channels directly.

One adopts a\nsophisticated molecular beam epitaxial procedure to grow atomically smooth\nepitaxial Ag films. However, the procedure is rather slow and becomes\nimpractical to grow films with thickness > 50 nm. Another approach adopts a\ngrowth process using rapid e-beam deposition which is capable of growing single\ncrystalline Ag films in the thick regime (> 300 nm).

This study focuses on quantifying the\nvariations of on-road fuel economy relative to official government ratings\n(fuel economy gap) and seeks proper characterizations for the degree of\nstochastic dependence between the fuel economy gaps of pairs of vehicles.By\nusing unique data reported by customers of the U.S. government website\nwww.fueleconomy.gov, the study presents an innovative copula-based\njoint-modeling and forecasting framework for exploring the complex stochastic\ndependencies (both nonlinear and non-normal) between the fuel economy gaps of\nvehicles reported by the same person. While the EPA label estimates are similar\nto the average numbers reported by website customers, significant, non-linear\nvariation exists in the fuel economy gaps for the two vehicles across the\nsample. In particular, a positive dependence, characterized by Student-t\ncopula, is observed between the fuel economy gaps of the two vehicles with\nsignificant dependencies in the tails of the bivariate distribution; a pair in\nwhich one vehicle achieves better (worse) fuel economy is likely to contain a\nsecond vehicle getting better (worse) fuel economy as well. However, the\nresults also suggest that the strength of overall association is weak (Kendall\nTau = 0.28). This implies a lack of compelling agreement between fuel economy\ngaps which could weaken consumers confidence in making relative comparisons\namong vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 22:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

Fine-grained places are often significantly more\nfrequent and more similar to each other, and disambiguation heuristics\ndeveloped for larger places, such as those based on population or containment\nrelationships, are often not applicable in these cases. In this research, we\naddress the disambiguation of fine-grained place names from everyday place\ndescriptions. For this purpose, we evaluate the performance of different\nexisting clustering-based approaches, since clustering approaches require no\nmore knowledge other than the locations of ambiguous place names. We consider\nnot only approaches developed specifically for place name disambiguation, but\nalso clustering algorithms developed for general data mining that could\npotentially be leveraged.

The analysis utilizes data from a matched\ncase-control design collected through the FHWA Motorcycle Crash Causation\nStudy. In particular, 351 cases (motorcyclists involved in injury crashes) are\nanalyzed vis-a-vis similarly-at-risk 702 matched controls (motorcyclists not\ninvolved in crashes).

Overall, the correlations between key\nrisk factors and injury crash propensity exhibit significant observed and\nunobserved heterogeneity. The results of best-fit random parameters logit model\nwith heterogeneity-in-means show that riders with partial helmet coverage have\na significantly lower risk of injury crash involvement. Lack of motorcycle\nrider conspicuity captured by dark (red) upper body clothing is associated with\nsignificantly higher injury crash risk (odds ratio 3.87). Importantly, a rider\nmotorcycle-oriented lower clothing significantly lowers the odds of injury\ncrash involvement. Formal motorcycle driving training in recent years was\nassociated with lower injury crash propensity.

In this study, driving task is divided into distinct yet unobserved\nregimes. The research issue is to characterize and quantify these regimes in\ntypical driving cycles and the associated volatility of each regime, explore\nwhen the regimes change and the key correlates associated with each regime.\nUsing Basic Safety Message (BSM) data from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment in\nAnn Arbor, Michigan, two- and three-regime Dynamic Markov switching models are\nestimated for several trips undertaken on various roadway types. While\nthousands of instrumented vehicles with V2V and V2I communication systems are\nbeing tested, nearly 1.4 million records of BSMs, from 184 trips undertaken by\n71 instrumented vehicles are analyzed in this study. Then even more detailed\nanalysis of 43 randomly chosen trips (N = 714,340 BSM records) that were\nundertaken on various roadway types is conducted. The results indicate that\nacceleration and deceleration are two distinct regimes, and as compared to\nacceleration, drivers decelerate at higher rates, and braking is significantly\nmore volatile than acceleration. Different correlations of the two regimes with\ninstantaneous driving contexts are explored. With a more generic three-regime\nmodel specification, the results reveal high-rate acceleration, high-rate\ndeceleration, and cruise/constant as the three distinct regimes that\ncharacterize a typical driving cycle.

Of particular interest here are tuneable\nradio-frequency (RF) oscillators for wireless communication. Currently, the\nstructure that maximizes the output power is an Fe/MgO/Fe-type magnetic tunnel\njunction (MTJ) with a fixed layer magnetized in the plane of the layers and a\nfree layer magnetized perpendicular to the plane. This structure allows for\nmost of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) to be converted into output power.\nHere, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate that the main mechanism\nsustaining steady-state precession in such structures is the angular dependence\nof the magnetoresistance. The TMR of such devices is known to exhibit a\nbroken-linear dependence versus the applied bias. Our results show that the TMR\nbias dependence effectively quenches spin-transfer-driven precession and\nintroduces a non-monotonic frequency dependence at high applied currents.

In vivo, ECs are\nconstantly under flow, and the concentration of ATP/ADP on the EC surface is\ndetermined by the combined effects of nucleotide convective and diffusive\ntransport as well as hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases on the EC surface. In\naddition, experiments have demonstrated that flow induces ATP release from the\ncells. Previously computational models have incorporated the above effects and\nthus described concentration at the EC surface. However, it remains unclear\nwhat physical processes are responsible for nucleotide regulation. While some\nEC responses to flow have been shown to be directly driven by shear stress,\nothers appear to also involve a non-negligible contribution of transport. In\nthe present work, we develop a mathematical model and perform numerical\nsimulations to investigate the relative contributions of shear stress and\ntransport to nucleotide concentration at the EC surface, with the effect of\ncell density. Because in vitro experiments are performed by using confluent\ncells in some cases and subconfluent cells in other cases, we also investigate\nthe effect of cell density on the results. The outcomes of the simulations\ndemonstrate a complex interplay between shear stress and transport such that\ntransport has a significant contribution at certain shear stress values but not\nat others. The effect of transport on nucleotide concentration increases with\ncell density. The present findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms\nthat govern the regulation of such molecules at the EC surface under flow. The\nimplications of these findings for downstream responses such as cellular\nmotility merit future investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 15:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}
