In the case of a singular flat\nband, its Bloch wave function possesses immovable discontinuities generated by\nthe band-crossing with other bands, and thus the vector bundle associated with\nthe flat band cannot be defined. This singularity precludes the compact\nlocalized states from forming a complete set spanning the flat band. Once the\ndegeneracy at the band crossing point is lifted, the singular flat band becomes\ndispersive and can acquire a finite Chern number in general, suggesting a new\nroute for obtaining a nearly flat Chern band. On the other hand, the Bloch wave\nfunction of a nonsingular flat band has no singularity, and thus forms a vector\nbundle. A nonsingular flat band can be completely isolated from other bands\nwhile preserving the perfect flatness. All one-dimensional flat bands belong to\nthe nonsingular class.

However, on-demand (OD) mobility -- such as commercial services Uber,\nGrab or Didi -- has started reducing parking needs in urban areas around the\nworld. This trend is expected to grow significantly with the advent of\nautonomous driving, which might render on-demand mobility predominant. Recent\nstudies have started looking at expected parking reductions with on-demand\nmobility, but a systematic framework is still lacking. In this paper, we apply\na data-driven methodology based on shareability networks to address what we\ncall the \"minimum parking\" problem: what is the minimum parking infrastructure\nneeded in a city for given on-demand mobility needs? While solving the problem,\nwe also identify a critical tradeoff between two public policy goals: less\nparking means increased vehicle travel from deadheading between trips. By\napplying our methodology to the city of Singapore we discover that parking\ninfrastructure reduction of up to 86% is possible, but at the expense of a 24%\nincrease in traffic measured as vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT). However, a\nmore modest 57% reduction in parking is achievable with only a 1.3% increase in\nVKT. We find that the tradeoff between parking and traffic obeys an inverse\nexponential law which is invariant with the size of the vehicle fleet, leading\nto a simple methodology to estimate aggregate parking demand in a city.\nFinally, we analyze parking requirements due to passenger pick-ups and show\nthat increasing convenience produces a substantial increase in parking for\npassenger pickup/dropoff. The above mathematical findings can inform\npolicy-makers, mobility operators, and society at large on the tradeoffs\nrequired in the transition towards pervasive on-demand mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 17:26:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 06:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

In contrast to traditional\ngrowth by ballistic collisions with planetesimals, growth by pebble accretion\nis not necessarily limited by doubling times at the highest core mass.\nTurbulence, in particular, can cause growth to bottleneck at lower core masses.\nWe demonstrate how a combination of growth by planetesimal and pebble accretion\nlimits the maximum semi-major axis where gas giants can form.

In\ncontrast, local projective measurements disentangle degrees of freedom and\ndecrease entanglement. We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by\nconsidering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We\nbegin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that\nmeasurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,\nin contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary\ntime evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we\nanalytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit\nan entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size\ndistributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed\npoints.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on\nthe order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any\nnon-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an\narea law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that\na system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law\nentanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which\nprovides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement\nphase.

As mass transfer runs away at increasing rates, gas\ntrails away from the binary.

The former occurs for $p$ smaller than a critical rate $p_c$,\nand is characterized by volume-law entanglement in the steady-state and\n`ballistic' entanglement growth after a quench.

In recent years such systems have received renewed attention\ndue to the advent of materials in which Dirac electrons are the mediating\nparticles, with prominent examples being graphene and topological insulator\nsurfaces. In this paper, we demonstrate that such systems can host a remarkable\nvariety of behaviors, in many cases controlled only by the density of electrons\nin the system. Uniquely characteristic of these systems is an emergent\nlong-range form of the spin stiffnes when the Fermi energy resides at a Dirac\npoint, becoming truly long-range as the magnetization density becomes very\nsmall. It is demonstrated that this leads to screened Coulomb-like interactions\namong domain walls, via a subtle mechanism in which the topology of the Dirac\nelectrons plays a key role: the combination of attraction due to bound in-gap\nstates that the topology necessitates, and repulsion due to scattering phase\nshifts, yields logarithmic interactions over a range of length scales. We\npresent detailed results for domain walls in a particularly rich system, the\n(111) surface of a model topological crystalline insulator. This hosts two-fold\nand six- fold degenerate groundstates, with either short-range or emergent\nlong-range interactions among the spins. In the latter case we demonstrate in\ndetail the presence of in-gap states associated with domain walls, and argue\nthat this stabilizes a pseudogap regime at finite temperature. Thus the\ntopological nature of these systems, through its impact on domain wall\nexcitations, leads to unique behaviors distinguishing them markedly from their\nnon-topological analogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

We show that such\na limit must be located at infinite distance in the moduli space. As expected,\nthe low-energy effective theory breaks down in this limit due to a tower of\ncharged particles becoming massless. These are the excitations of an\nasymptotically tensionless string, which is shown to coincide with a critical\nheterotic string compactified to six dimensions. For a more quantitative\nanalysis, we focus on a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and use a chain of dualities and\nmirror symmetry to determine the elliptic genus of the nearly tensionless\nstring, which is given in terms of certain meromorphic weak Jacobi forms. Their\nmodular properties in turn allow us to determine the mass-to-charge ratios of\ncertain string excitations near the tensionless limit.

Whilst we understand small-scale\nresilience well, our understanding of large-scale networked resilience is\nlimited. Recent research in predicting the effective network-level resilience\npattern has advanced our understanding of the coupling relationship between\ntopology and dynamics. However, a method to estimate the resilience of an\nindividual node within an arbitrarily large complex network governed by\nnon-linear dynamics is still lacking. Here, we develop a sequential mean-field\napproach and show that after 1-3 steps of estimation, the node-level resilience\nfunction can be represented with up to 98\\% accuracy.

For the latter, the determination of the\ncharge radius involves an extrapolation of the experimental form factor to zero\nmomentum transfer.\n  Purpose: To estimate the proton radius by introducing a novel non-parametric\napproach to model the electric form factor of the proton.\n  Methods: Within a Bayesian paradigm, we develop a model flexible enough to\nfit the data without any parametric assumptions on the form factor. The\nBayesian estimation is guided by imposing only two physical constraints on the\nform factor: (a) its value at zero momentum transfer (normalization) and (b)\nits overall shape, assumed to be a monotonically decreasing function of the\nmomentum transfer. Variants of these assumptions are explored to assess the\nimpact of these constraints.\n  Results: So far our results are inconclusive in regard to the proton puzzle,\nas they depend on both, the assumed constrains and the range of experimental\ndata used. For example, if only low momentum-transfer data is used, adopting\nonly the normalization constraint provides a value compatible with the smaller\nmuonic result, while imposing only the shape constraint favors the larger\nelectronic value.\n  Conclusions: We have presented a novel technique to estimate the proton\nradius from electron scattering data based on a non-parametric Gaussian\nprocess. We have shown the impact of the physical constraints imposed on the\nform factor and of the range of experimental data used. In this regard, we are\nhopeful that as this technique is refined and with the anticipated new results\nfrom the PRad experiment, we will get closer to resolve of the puzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 19:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Some experiments in cuprates point toward a\nCDW state competing with superconductivity, but others raise the possibility of\na CDW-superconductivity intertwined order, or more elusive pair-density wave\n(PDW). Here we have used proton irradiation to induce disorder in crystals of\nLa$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$ and observed a striking 50% increase of\n$T_\\mathrm{c}$ accompanied by a suppression of the CDW. This is in clear\ncontradiction with the behaviour expected of a d-wave superconductor for which\nboth magnetic and non-magnetic defects should suppress $T_\\mathrm{c}$. Our\nresults thus make an unambiguous case for the strong detrimental effect of the\nCDW on bulk superconductivity in La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$. Using tunnel\ndiode oscillator (TDO) measurements, we find evidence for dynamic layer\ndecoupling in PDW phase.

The amount of mass present near this radius at\nthe time of the merger is critical in determining how much radiation is\nreleased. We explore the evolution of a circumbinary disc in two limits. First,\nwe consider an accretion disc that feels no torque from the binary. The disc\ndoes not survive until the merger unless there is a dead zone, a region of low\nturbulence. Even with the dead zone, the surface density in this case may be\nsmall. Second, we consider a disc that feels a strong binary torque that\nprevents accretion on to the binary. In this case there is significantly more\nmass in regions of interest at the time of the merger. A dead zone in this disc\nincreases the mass close to the recoil radius. For typical binary-disc\nparameters we expect accretion to be significantly slowed by the resonant\ntorque from the binary, and for a dead zone to be present. We conclude that\nprovided significant mass orbits the binary after the formation of the black\nhole binary and that the radiation produced in recoil shocks can escape the\nflow efficiently, there is likely to be an observable electromagnetic signal\nfrom black hole binary mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 00:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The majority of\ndeep re-ID methods focus on designing new CNN architectures, while less\nattention is paid on investigating the loss functions. Verification loss and\nidentification loss are two types of losses widely used to train various deep\nre-ID models, both of which however have limitations. Verification loss guides\nthe networks to generate feature embeddings of which the intra-class variance\nis decreased while the inter-class ones is enlarged. However, training networks\nwith verification loss tends to be of slow convergence and unstable performance\nwhen the number of training samples is large. On the other hand, identification\nloss has good separating and scalable property. But its neglect to explicitly\nreduce the intra-class variance limits its performance on re-ID, because the\nsame person may have significant appearance disparity across different camera\nviews. To avoid the limitations of the two types of losses, we propose a new\nloss, called support neighbor (SN) loss. Rather than being derived from data\nsample pairs or triplets, SN loss is calculated based on the positive and\nnegative support neighbor sets of each anchor sample, which contain more\nvaluable contextual information and neighborhood structure that are beneficial\nfor more stable performance. To ensure scalability and separability, a\nsoftmax-like function is formulated to push apart the positive and negative\nsupport sets. To reduce intra-class variance, the distance between the anchor's\nnearest positive neighbor and furthest positive sample is penalized.\nIntegrating SN loss on top of Resnet50, superior re-ID results to the\nstate-of-the-art ones are obtained on several widely used datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 01:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

In\nthis paper, the authors describe a general, yet relatively straightforward\napproach to test for GxE additive interaction exploiting G-E independence. The\napproach which relies on regression models for G and E is particularly\nattractive because, unlike the RERI-LRT, it allows the regression model for the\nbinary outcome to remain unrestricted. Therefore, the new methodology is\ncompletely robust to possible mis-specification in the outcome regression. This\nis particularly important for settings not easily handled by RERI-LRT, such as\nwhen E is a count or a continuous exposure with multiple components, or when\nthere are several auxiliary covariates in the regression model. While the\nproposed approach avoids fitting an outcome regression, it nonetheless still\nallows for straightforward covariate adjustment. The methods are illustrated\nthrough an extensive simulation study and an ovarian cancer empirical\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 03:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

However, features used\nin most Siamese tracking approaches can only discriminate foreground from the\nnon-semantic backgrounds. The semantic backgrounds are always considered as\ndistractors, which hinders the robustness of Siamese trackers. In this paper,\nwe focus on learning distractor-aware Siamese networks for accurate and\nlong-term tracking. To this end, features used in traditional Siamese trackers\nare analyzed at first. We observe that the imbalanced distribution of training\ndata makes the learned features less discriminative.

Rosen and\nSilverman proved a conjecture of Nagao relating the first moment\n$A_{1,\\mathcal{E}}(p)$ to the rank of the family over $\\mathbb{Q}(T)$, and\nMichel proved that if $j(T)$ is not constant then the second moment is equal to\n$A_{2,\\mathcal{E}}(p) = p^2 + O(p^{3/2})$. Cohomological arguments show that\nthe lower order terms are of sizes $p^{3/2}, p, p^{1/2}$, and $1$. In every\ncase we are able to analyze in closed form, the largest lower order term in the\nsecond moment expansion that does not average to zero is on average negative,\nthough numerics suggest this may fail for families of moderate rank. We prove\nthis Bias Conjecture for several large classes of families, including families\nwith rank, complex multiplication, and constant $j(T)$-invariant. We also study\nthe analogous Bias Conjecture for families of Dirichlet characters, holomorphic\nforms on GL$(2)/\\mathbb{Q}$, and their symmetric powers and Rankin-Selberg\nconvolutions. We identify all lower order terms in large classes of families,\nshedding light on the arithmetic objects controlling these terms. The negative\nbias in these lower order terms has implications toward the excess rank\nconjecture and the behavior of zeros near the central point in families of\n$L$-functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 08:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 01:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

On the one hand, it\nis not a gauge invariant, on the other hand, the Zak phase difference between\ntwo quantum phases can be used to identify the topological phase transitions. A\nnon-Hermitian system may inherit some characters of a Hermitian system, such as\nentirely real spectrum, unitary evolution, topological energy band, etc. In\nthis paper, we study the influence of non-Hermitian term on the Zak phase for a\nclass of non-Hermitian systems. We show exactly that the real part of the Zak\nphase remains unchanged in a bipartite lattice. In a concrete example, $1$D\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, we find that the real part of Zak phase can\nbe obtained by an adiabatic process. To demonstrate this finding, we\ninvestigate a scattering problem for a time-dependent scattering center, which\nis a magnetic-flux-driven non-Hermitian SSH ring. Owing to the nature of the\nZak phase, the intriguing features of this design are the wave-vector\nindependence and allow two distinct behaviors, perfect transmission or\nconfinement, depending on the timing of a flux impulse threading the ring. When\nthe flux is added during a wavepacket travelling within the ring, the\nwavepacket is confined in the scatter partially. Otherwise, it exhibits perfect\ntransmission through the scatter. Our finding extends the understanding and\nbroaden the possible application of geometric phase in a non-Hermitian system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 11:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Considering the possible real-time information provided by\nwide-area measurement systems, a group of system-level classification features\nare extracted from the power system operation parameters to build the original\nfeature set. By defining a KFRS-based generalized classification function as\nthe separability criterion, the memetic algorithm based on binary differential\nevolution (BDE) and Tabu search (TS) is employed to obtain the optimal feature\nsubsets with the maximized classification capability. The proposed method may\navoid the information loss caused by the feature discretization process of the\nrough-set based attribute selection, and comprehensively utilize the advantages\nof BDE and TS to improve the solution quality and search efficiency.

Various different methods have been presented regarding\nthis matter due to the above-mentioned reason and also the ever-growing demand\nfor the engineers and the building-industry specialists for strengthening,\nrestoring, and improving the concrete structures. The effect of FRP sheets on\nshear and flexural strengthening of simple concrete beams has been examined in\nthis research. Four concrete beams containing concrete were constructed with a\nsimilar cross section and length and a common resistance level. They underwent\nthe two-point flexural test and their exploitation conditions were studied. The\nresults showed that if the FRP sheets are used appropriately and with proper\nbracing in strengthening the concrete beam samples, there will be a significant\nincrease in their shear and flexural strength. Moreover, it was observed that\nrelative deformation measured on the concrete surface and the GFRP sheet is\nproportional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 00:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 21:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

The fact that contents in DWeb are\ndistributed, replicated, and decentralized lead to a number of key advantages\nover the conventional web. These include better resiliency against network\npartitioning and distributed-denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), and better\nbrowsing experiences in terms of shorter latency and higher throughput.\nMoreover, DWeb provides tamper-proof contents because each content piece is\nuniquely identified by a cryptographic hash. DWeb also clicks well with future\nInternet architectures, such as Named Data Networking (NDN).Search engines have\nbeen an inseparable element of the Web. Contemporary (\"Web 2.0\") search\nengines, however, provide centralized services. They are thus subject to DDoS\nattacks, insider threat, and ethical issues like search bias and censorship.

This is because the path integral cannot properly take into account\nthe boundary condition, which is due to the presence of the scattering states\nin the Coulomb potential system. On the other hand, the Sommerfeld quantization\ncan reproduce the right energy spectrum of both harmonic oscillator and Coulomb\npotential cases since the boundary condition is effectively taken into account\nin this semiclassical treatment. The basic difference between the two schemes\nshould be that no constraint is imposed on the wave function in the path\nintegral while the Sommerfeld quantization rule is derived by requiring that\nthe state vector should be a single-valued function. The limitation of the\nsemiclassical method is also clarified in terms of the square well and\n$\\delta(x)$ function potential models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 15:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

IPv4 is the fourth\nversion of IP and first commercially available for deployment set by ARPANET in\n1983 which is a 32 bit long address and can support up to 232 devices. In April\n2017, all Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) confirmed that IPv4 addresses are\nexhausted and cannot be allocated anymore implying any new organization\nrequesting a block of Internet addresses will be allocated IPv6. This creates\ntroubles of interoperability, migration and deployment, and therefore\norganizations hesitated to use IPv6 borrowing IPv4 addresses from other big\norganizations instead. Currently, when IPv4 is not available, and IPv6 is not\nadopted for around 20 years, the question arises whether IPv6 will still be\naccepted by the computer society or will it have an end of life soon with\nalternate better protocol such as ID based networks taking its place. This\npaper claims that IPv6 has lost its deployment window and can be safely skipped\nwhen new ID based protocols are available which not only have simple\ninteroperability, deployment and migration guidelines but also provide advanced\nfeatures as compared to IPv6. The paper provides answers to these questions\nwith a comprehensive comparison of IPv6 with its available alternatives and\nreasons of IPv6 failures in its adoption. Finally, the paper declares IPv6 as a\ndead protocol and suggests to use newer available protocols in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 20:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}
