We built\na machine learning causal inference model to determine patient subpopulations\nlikely to respond better to the newly approved drug. After identifying the\npresence of secular trend bias in our data, we attempted to adjust for the bias\nin two different ways. First, we matched patients on the number of days from\nthe new drug's approval date that the patient's treatment (new or standard)\nbegan. Second, we included a covariate in the model for the number of days\nbetween the date of approval of the new drug and the treatment (new or\nstandard) start date. Neither approach completely mitigated the bias. Residual\nbias we attribute to differences in patient disease severity or other\nunmeasured patient characteristics. Had we not identified the secular trend\nbias in our data, the causal inference model would have been interpreted\nwithout consideration for this underlying bias. Being aware of, testing for,\nand handling potential bias in the data is essential to diminish the\nuncertainty in AI modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 19:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

The flexibility of engineering long-ranged phonon-mediated\nspin-spin interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator offers such a\npossibility. Trapped ions, a leading candidate for simulating computationally\nhard quantum many-body dynamics, are most readily trapped in a linear 1D chain,\nlimiting their utility for readily simulating higher dimensional spin models.\nIn this work, we introduce a hybrid method of analog-digital simulation for\nsimulating 2D spin models and dynamically changing interactions to achieve a\nnew graph using a linear 1D chain. The method relies on time domain Hamiltonian\nengineering through a successive application of Stark shift gradient pulses,\nand wherein the pulse sequence can simply be obtained from a Fourier series\ndecomposition of the target Hamiltonian over the space of lattice couplings. We\nfocus on engineering 2D rectangular nearest-neighbor spin lattices,\ndemonstrating that the required control parameters scale linearly with ion\nnumber. This hybrid approach offers compelling possibilities for the use of 1D\nchains in the study of Hamiltonian quenches, dynamical phase transitions, and\nquantum transport in 2D and 3D. We discuss a possible experimental\nimplementation of this approach using real experimental parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 19:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

First, we\nused a hybrid URANS model for turbulence to simulate the 3D unsteady cloud\ncavitating flow and validated it based on experimental data. We performed the\nnumerical simulations using open source code OpenFOAM and an Euler-Euler\ncavitation model. Second, we studied the effect of passive boundary layer\ncontrol method on vortex structure on the suction side of the hydrofoil and in\nwake region. We showed that this control method may influence the boundary\nlayer structure on the hydrofoil surface and also near the trailing edge. Using\nthis technique the pressure distribution and the fluctuating part of the\nvelocity field on the hydrofoil surface were modified over the chord length.\nThis method induced a stabilization of the boundary layer and delay its\nseparation.

Existing methods heavily rely on multi-column\nlearning architectures to extract multi-scale features, which however suffer\nfrom heavy computational cost, especially undesired for crowd counting. In this\npaper, we propose the single-column counting network (SCNet) for efficient\ncrowd counting without relying on multi-column networks. SCNet consists of\nresidual fusion modules (RFMs) for multi-scale feature extraction, a pyramid\npooling module (PPM) for information fusion, and a sub-pixel convolutional\nmodule (SPCM) followed by a bilinear upsampling layer for resolution recovery.\nThose proposed modules enable our SCNet to fully capture multi-scale features\nin a compact single-column architecture and estimate high-resolution density\nmap in an efficient way. In addition, we provide a principled paradigm for\ndensity map generation and data augmentation for training, which shows further\nimproved performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show\nthat our SCNet delivers new state-of-the-art performance and surpasses previous\nmethods by large margins, which demonstrates the great effectiveness of SCNet\nas a single-column network for crowd counting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 21:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

Therefore, digital evidence on smartphones plays an\nincreasingly important role in crime investigations. Digital evidence could\nreside in the memory and permanent storage of a smartphone. While we have\nwitnessed significant progresses on memory forensics recently, identifying\nevidence in the permanent storage is still an underdeveloped research area.\nMost existing studies on permanent-storage forensics rely on manual analysis or\nkeyword-based scanning of the permanent storage. Manual analysis is costly,\nwhile keyword matching often misses the evidentiary data that do not have\ninteresting keywords.\n  In this work, we develop a tool called EviHunter to automatically identify\nevidentiary data in the permanent storage of an Android device. There could be\nthousands of files on the permanent storage of a smartphone. A basic question a\nforensic investigator often faces is which files could store evidentiary data.\nEviHunter aims to answer this question. Our intuition is that the evidentiary\ndata were produced by apps; and an app's code has rich information about the\ntypes of data the app may write to a permanent storage and the files the data\nare written to. Therefore, EviHunter first pre-computes an App Evidence\nDatabase (AED) via static analysis of a large number of apps. The AED includes\nthe types of evidentiary data and files that store them for each app. Then,\nEviHunter matches the files on a smartphone's permanent storage against the AED\nto identify the files that could store evidentiary data.\n  We evaluate EviHunter on benchmark apps and 8,690 real-world apps. Our\nresults show that EviHunter can precisely identify both the types of\nevidentiary data and the files that store them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2018 22:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

In such cases, resource pooling between\nindependent service providers can be used to improve performance. However, for\nproviders to agree to pool their resources, the arrangement has to be mutually\nbeneficial. The traditional notion of resource pooling, which implies complete\nsharing, need not have this property. For example, under full pooling, one of\nthe providers may be worse off and hence have no incentive to participate. In\nthis paper, we propose partial resource sharing models as a generalization of\nfull pooling, which can be configured to be beneficial to all participants.\n  We formally define and analyze two partial sharing models between two service\nproviders, each of which is an Erlang-B loss system with the blocking\nprobabilities as the performance measure. We show that there always exist\npartial sharing configurations that are beneficial to both providers,\nirrespective of the load and the number of circuits of each of the providers. A\nkey result is that the Pareto frontier has at least one of the providers\nsharing all its resources with the other. Furthermore, full pooling may not lie\ninside this Pareto set. The choice of the sharing configurations within the\nPareto set is formalized based on bargaining theory.

This novel feature is\nan extension of the pixel-wise HOG descriptors, and outperforms that both in\nmatching performance and computational efficiency. The major advantage of the\nproposed framework includes: (1) structural similarity representation using the\npixel-wise feature description and (2) high computational efficiency due to the\nuse of 3DFFT. Experimental results on different types of multimodal images show\nthe superior matching performance of the proposed framework than the\nstate-of-the-art methods.The proposed matching framework have been used in the\nsoftware products of a Chinese listed company.

The main challenge of the topic lies in the semantics-equivalent\ncode transformation (e.g., optimization, obfuscation) which would alter\nrepresentations of binary code tremendously. Another chal- lenge is the\ntrade-off between detection accuracy and coverage. Unfortunately, existing\ntechniques still rely on semantics-less code features which are susceptible to\nthe code transformation. Besides, they adopt merely either a static or a\ndynamic approach to detect binary code clones, which cannot achieve high\naccuracy and coverage simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a\nsemantics-based hybrid approach to detect binary clone functions. We execute a\ntemplate binary function with its test cases, and emulate the execution of\nevery target function for clone comparison with the runtime information\nmigrated from that template function. The semantic signatures are extracted\nduring the execution of the template function and emulation of the target\nfunction. Lastly, a similarity score is calculated from their signatures to\nmeasure their likeness. We implement the approach in a prototype system\ndesignated as BinMatch which analyzes IA-32 binary code on the Linux platform.\nWe evaluate BinMatch with eight real-world projects compiled with different\ncompilation configurations and commonly-used obfuscation methods, totally\nperforming over 100 million pairs of function comparison. The experimental\nresults show that BinMatch is robust to the semantics-equivalent code\ntransformation. Besides, it not only covers all target functions for clone\nanalysis, but also improves the detection accuracy comparing to the\nstate-of-the-art solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2018 14:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

Recently, a\nphysics-informed machine-learning (PIML) approach has been proposed for\nreconstructing the discrepancies in RANS-modeled Reynolds stresses. The merits\nof the PIML framework has been demonstrated in several canonical incompressible\nflows. However, its performance on high-Mach-number flows is still not clear.\nIn this work we use the PIML approach to predict the discrepancies in RANS\nmodeled Reynolds stresses in high-Mach-number flat-plate turbulent boundary\nlayers by using an existing DNS database. Specifically, the discrepancy\nfunction is first constructed using a DNS training flow and then used to\ncorrect RANS-predicted Reynolds stresses under flow conditions different from\nthe DNS. The machine-learning technique is shown to significantly improve\nRANS-modeled turbulent normal stresses, the turbulent kinetic energy, and the\nReynolds-stress anisotropy. Improvements are consistently observed when\ndifferent training datasets are used. Moreover, a high-dimensional\nvisualization technique and distance metrics are used to provide a priori\nassessment of prediction confidence based only on RANS simulations. This study\ndemonstrates that the PIML approach is a computationally affordable technique\nfor improving the accuracy of RANS-modeled Reynolds stresses for\nhigh-Mach-number turbulent flows when there is a lack of experiments and\nhigh-fidelity simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2018 03:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}
