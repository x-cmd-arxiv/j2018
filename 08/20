The\nfocus of our approach is on an integrated Kullback-Leibler distance between the\nEL-based posterior and prior density functions. The EL prior density is the\ndensity function for which the corresponding posterior form is asymptotically\nnegligibly different from the EL.

To show that RL=L, it suffices to construct\nexplicit pseudorandom generators (PRGs) that fool polynomial-size read-once\n(oblivious) branching programs (roBPs). Starting with the work of Nisan,\npseudorandom generators with seed-length $O(\\log^2 n)$ were constructed.\nUnfortunately, improving on this seed-length in general has proven challenging\nand seems to require new ideas.\n  A recent line of inquiry has suggested focusing on a particular limitation of\nthe existing PRGs, which is that they only fool roBPs when the variables are\nread in a particular known order, such as $x_1<\\cdots<x_n$. In comparison,\nexistentially one can obtain logarithmic seed-length for fooling the set of\npolynomial-size roBPs that read the variables under any fixed unknown\npermutation $x_{\\pi(1)}<\\cdots<x_{\\pi(n)}$. While recent works have established\nnovel PRGs in this setting for subclasses of roBPs, there were no known\n$n^{o(1)}$ seed-length explicit PRGs for general polynomial-size roBPs in this\nsetting.\n  In this work, we follow the \"bounded independence plus noise\" paradigm of\nHaramaty, Lee and Viola, and give an improved analysis in the general roBP\nunknown-order setting. With this analysis we obtain an explicit PRG with\nseed-length $O(\\log^3 n)$ for polynomial-size roBPs reading their bits in an\nunknown order.

However, how the statistics of such\nevents depend on local interactions among the constituent units remains\ndebated. To address this we perform experiments on granular material in which\nwe use particle shape to vary the interactions systematically. Granular\nmaterial, confined under constant pressure boundary conditions, is uniaxially\ncompressed while stress is measured and internal rearrangements are imaged with\nx-rays. We introduce volatility, a quantity from economic theory, as a powerful\nnew tool to quantify the magnitude of stress fluctuations, finding systematic,\nshape-dependent trends. For all 22 investigated shapes the magnitude $s$ of\nrelaxation events is well-fit by a truncated power law distribution $P(s)\\sim\n{s}^{-\\tau} exp(-s/s^*)$, as has been proposed within the context of plasticity\nmodels. The power law exponent $\\tau$ for all shapes tested clusters around\n$\\tau=$ 1.5, within experimental uncertainty covering the range 1.3 - 1.7. The\nshape independence of $\\tau$ and its compatibility with mean field models\nindicate that the granularity of the system, but not particle shape, modifies\nthe stress redistribution after a slip event away from that of continuum\nelasticity. Meanwhile, the characteristic maximum event size $s^*$ changes by\ntwo orders of magnitude and tracks the shape dependence of volatility. Particle\nshape in granular materials is therefore a powerful new factor influencing the\ndistance at which an amorphous system operates from scale-free criticality.\nThese experimental results are not captured by current models and suggest a\nneed to reexamine the mechanisms driving mesoscale plastic deformation in\namorphous systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2018 23:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 16:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 23:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In this paper, we propose a novel type of cross-modal\nmultimedia retrieval called geo-multimedia cross-modal retrieval which aims to\nsearch out a set of geo-multimedia objects based on geographical distance\nproximity and semantic similarity between different modalities. Previous\nstudies for cross-modal retrieval and spatial keyword search cannot address\nthis problem effectively because they do not consider multimedia data with\ngeo-tags and do not focus on this type of query. In order to address this\nproblem efficiently, we present the definition of $k$NN geo-multimedia\ncross-modal query at the first time and introduce relevant conceptions such as\ncross-modal semantic representation space. To bridge the semantic gap between\ndifferent modalities, we propose a method named cross-modal semantic matching\nwhich contains two important component, i.e., CorrProj and LogsTran, which aims\nto construct a common semantic representation space for cross-modal semantic\nsimilarity measurement. Besides, we designed a framework based on deep learning\ntechniques to implement common semantic representation space construction. In\naddition, a novel hybrid indexing structure named GMR-Tree combining\ngeo-multimedia data and R-Tree is presented and a efficient $k$NN search\nalgorithm called $k$GMCMS is designed.

The thermal treatment is applied by repeatedly\nheating and cooling the system at constant pressure, thus temporarily inducing\ninternal stresses upon thermal expansion. We find that poorly annealed glasses\nare relocated to progressively lower levels of potential energy over\nconsecutive cycles, whereas well annealed glasses can be rejuvenated at\nsufficiently large amplitudes of thermal cycling.

Due to the existence of a nonzero axial component of the field\nin a guided mode, the Rabi frequency and, hence, the magnitude of the force of\nthe guided driving field may depend on the propagation direction.

For\nexample, there is still a lack of theories of convergence for SGD and its\nvariants that use stagewise step size and return an averaged solution in\npractice. In addition, theoretical insights of why adaptive step size of\nAdaGrad could improve non-adaptive step size of {\\sgd} is still missing for\nnon-convex optimization. This paper aims to address these questions and fill\nthe gap between theory and practice. We propose a universal stagewise\noptimization framework for a broad family of {\\bf non-smooth non-convex}\n(namely weakly convex) problems with the following key features: (i) at each\nstage any suitable stochastic convex optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD or\nAdaGrad) that return an averaged solution can be employed for minimizing a\nregularized convex problem; (ii) the step size is decreased in a stagewise\nmanner; (iii) an averaged solution is returned as the final solution that is\nselected from all stagewise averaged solutions with sampling probabilities {\\it\nincreasing} as the stage number. Our theoretical results of stagewise AdaGrad\nexhibit its adaptive convergence, therefore shed insights on its faster\nconvergence for problems with sparse stochastic gradients than stagewise SGD.\nTo the best of our knowledge, these new results are the first of their kind for\naddressing the unresolved issues of existing theories mentioned earlier.\nBesides theoretical contributions, our empirical studies show that our\nstagewise SGD and ADAGRAD improve the generalization performance of existing\nvariants/implementations of SGD and ADAGRAD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 03:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 22:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 02:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

In this paper, we propose a\nmarketplace for the WoD as a solution for this data monetization problem.

Nevertheless, it still suffers from two\nfundamentally limitations. First, it is quite susceptible to low-frequency\nerrors (such as \\cloudy\" artifacts), which results from the poor contrast of\nthe phase transfer function (PTF) near the zero frequency. Second, the\nreconstructed phase tends to blur under spatially low-coherent illumination,\nespecially when the defocus distance is beyond the near Fresnel region. Recent\nstudies have shown that the shape of the illumination aperture has a\nsignificant impact on the resolution and phase reconstruction quality, and by\nsimply replacing the conventional circular illumination aperture with an\nannular one, these two limitations can be addressed, or at least significantly\nalleviated. However, the annular aperture was previously empirically designed\nbased on intuitive criteria related to the shape of PTF, which does not\nguarantee optimality. In this work, we optimize the illumination pattern to\nmaximize TIE's performance based on a combined quantitative criterion for\nevaluating the \\goodness\" of an aperture. In order to make the size of the\nsolution search space tractable, we restrict our attention to binary coded\naxis-symmetric illumination patterns only, which are easier to implement and\ncan generate isotropic TIE PTFs. We test the obtained optimal illumination by\nimaging both a phase resolution target and HeLa cells based on a small-pitch\nLED array, suggesting superior performance over other suboptimal patterns in\nterms of both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 09:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

One recent\ndirection that has shown fruitful results, and therefore growing interest, is\nthe usage of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). They have been shown\nto provide a significant improvement on a wide range of tasks in network\nanalysis, one of which being node representation learning. The task of learning\nlow-dimensional node representations has shown to increase performance on a\nplethora of other tasks from link prediction and node classification, to\ncommunity detection and visualization. Simultaneously, signed networks (or\ngraphs having both positive and negative links) have become ubiquitous with the\ngrowing popularity of social media. However, since previous GCN models have\nprimarily focused on unsigned networks (or graphs consisting of only positive\nlinks), it is unclear how they could be applied to signed networks due to the\nchallenges presented by negative links. The primary challenges are based on\nnegative links having not only a different semantic meaning as compared to\npositive links, but their principles are inherently different and they form\ncomplex relations with positive links. Therefore we propose a dedicated and\nprincipled effort that utilizes balance theory to correctly aggregate and\npropagate the information across layers of a signed GCN model.

This new\nRequirements to Requirements Set (R2RS) family of metrics captures the semantic\nsimilarity between a new requirement and the set of existing requirements\npreviously associated with a class. The aim of this paper is to present and\nevaluate the usefulness of R2RS metrics in predicting the set of classes\nimpacted by a requirement. We consider 18 different R2RS metrics by combining\nsix natural language processing techniques to measure the semantic similarity\namong texts (e.g., VSM) and three distribution scores to compute overall\nsimilarity (e.g., average among similarity scores). We evaluate if R2RS is\nuseful for predicting impacted classes in combination and against four other\nfamilies of metrics that are based upon temporal locality of changes, direct\nsimilarity to code, complexity metrics, and code smells. Our evaluation\nfeatures five classifiers and 78 releases belonging to four large open-source\nprojects, which result in over 700,000 candidate impacted classes.

Although the disease\nevolution spans decades, to date we cannot rely on long-term data to model the\npathological progression, since most of the available measures are on a\nshort-term scale. It is therefore difficult to understand and quantify the\ntemporal progression patterns affecting the brain regions across the AD\nevolution. In this work, we tackle this problem by presenting a generative\nmodel based on probabilistic matrix factorization across temporal and spatial\nsources. The proposed method addresses the problem of disease progression\nmodelling by introducing clinically-inspired statistical priors. To promote\nsmoothness in time and model plausible pathological evolutions, the temporal\nsources are defined as monotonic and independent Gaussian Processes. We also\nestimate an individual time-shift parameter for each patient to automatically\nposition him/her along the sources time-axis. To encode the spatial continuity\nof the brain sub-structures, the spatial sources are modeled as Gaussian random\nfields. We test our algorithm on grey matter maps extracted from brain\nstructural images. The experiments highlight differential temporal progression\npatterns mapping brain regions key to the AD pathology, and reveal a\ndisease-specific time scale associated with the decline of volumetric\nbiomarkers across clinical stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 09:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

It leads to the conclusion that it is possible to\ndetermine with high accuracy the simultaneous mean weak values of non-commuting\noperators by judicious choice of the pre- and post-selected states. Generally,\nwhen the time fluctuations of the two weak values are proportional to each\nother there is no uncertainty limitation on their variances and, in principle,\ntheir means can be determined with arbitrary precision even though their\ncorresponding operators do not commute. To exemplify these properties we\nconsider specific weak value uncertainty relations for the time-energy,\ncoordinate-momentum and coordinate-kinetic energy pairs. In addition we analyze\nspin operators and the Stern-Gerlach experiment in weak and strong\ninhomogeneous magnetic fields. This classic case leads to anomalous spin values\nwhen the field is weak. However, anomalous spin values are also associated with\nlarge variances implying that their measurement demands increased signal\naveraging. These examples establish the importance of considering the time\ndependence of weak values in time of flight scattering experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 11:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 09:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Both types of codebook are\nconstructed from 2-D DFT based grid of beams, and enable the CSI feedback of\nbeam selection as well as PSK based co-phase combining between two\npolarizations. Moreover, Type-2 codebook based CSI feedback reports the\nwideband and subband amplitude information of the selected beams. As a result,\nit is envisioned that more accurate CSI shall be obtained from the Type-2\ncodebook based CSI feedback so that better precoded MIMO transmission can be\nemployed by the network. To reduce the CSI feedback signaling, 1 bit based\nsubband amplitude with only two quantization levels is supported in combination\nto 3 bits based wideband amplitude feedback. Typically, wideband amplitude\nshall be calculated as the linear average amplitude of the beam over all\nsubbands. However, due to the coarse subband amplitude quantization, it has\nbeen observed in case of joint wideband and subband amplitude feedback, the\naverage based wideband amplitude can lead to a large amplitude quantization\nerrors. In this paper, we study two methods for joint wideband and subband\namplitude calculations. Specifically, both optimal and sub-optimal methods are\nproposed. The optimal method can achieve the minimum amplitude quantization\nerrors at the cost of a relatively large computation complexity. And by virtue\nof a derived scaling factor, the sub-optimal method exhibits clearly smaller\nquantization error than the conventional linear average based method especially\nfor the channel with large frequency selectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 11:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

Pulsars scintillate. Dynamic spectra show brightness variation of\npulsars in the time and frequency domain. Secondary spectra demonstrate the\ndistribution of fluctuation power in the dynamic spectra. Aims. Dynamic spectra\nstrongly depend on observational frequencies, but were often observed at\nfrequencies lower than 1.5 GHz. Scintillation observations at higher\nfrequencies help to constrain the turbulence feature of the interstellar medium\nover a wide frequency range and can detect the scintillations of more distant\npulsars. Methods. Ten pulsars were observed at 2250 MHz (S-band) with the\nJiamusi 66 m telescope to study their scintillations. Their dynamic spectra\nwere first obtained, from which the decorrelation bandwidths and time scales of\ndiffractive scintillation were then derived by autocorrelation. Secondary\nspectra were calculated by forming the Fourier power spectra of the dynamic\nspectra. Results. Most of the newly obtained dynamic spectra are at the highest\nfrequency or have the longest time span of any published data for these\npulsars. For PSRs B0540+23, B2324+60 and B2351+61, these were the first dynamic\nspectra ever reported. The frequencydependence of scintillation parameters\nindicates that the intervening medium can rarely be ideally turbulent with a\nKolmogorov spectrum. The thin screen model worked well at S-band for the\nscintillation of PSR B1933+16. Parabolic arcs were detected in the secondary\nspectra of three pulsars, PSRs B0355+54, B0540+23 and B2154+40, all of which\nwere asymmetrically distributed. The inverted arclets of PSR B0355+54 were seen\nto evolve along the main parabola within a continuous observing session of 12\nhours, from which the angular velocity of the pulsar was estimated that was\nconsistent with the measurement by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 11:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

Our work identifies the first PPP-complete problem without any circuit\nor Turing Machine given explicitly in the input, and thus we answer a\nlongstanding open question from [Papadimitriou1994]. Specifically, we show that\nconstrained-SIS (cSIS), a generalized version of the well-known Short Integer\nSolution problem (SIS) from lattice-based cryptography, is PPP-complete.\n  In order to give intuition behind our reduction for constrained-SIS, we\nidentify another PPP-complete problem with a circuit in the input but closely\nrelated to lattice problems.

Moreover, the\ncomputation and inference are challenging due to the non-smoothness of\nartificial censoring.

There are mainly two methods to assess this stratification,\nbut they yield different magnetic gradients in the photospheric layers.\nDeterminations based on the different origin of several spectral lines and the\nslope of their profiles result in gradients of -2 to -3G/km, or even steeper.\nThis is similar for the total magnetic field strength and for the vertical\ncomponent of the magnetic field. The other option is to determine the\nhorizontal partial derivatives of the magnetic field, and with the condition\ndivB=0, also the vertical derivative is known. With this method, gradients of\n-0.5 G/km and shallower are obtained. Obviously, these results do not agree. If\nchromospheric spectral lines are included, only shallow gradients around\n-0.5G/km are encountered. Shallow gradients are also found from gyro-resonance\nmeasurements in the radio wave range 300 - 2000GHz. Some indirect methods are\nalso considered, but they cannot clarify the total picture. An analysis of a\nnumerical simulation of a sunspot indicates a shallow gradient over a wide\nheight range, but with slightly steeper gradients in deep layers. Several ideas\nto explain the discrepancy are also discussed. With no doubts cast on Maxwell's\nequations, the first one is to look at the uncertainties of the formation\nheights of spectral lines, but a wider range of these heights would require an\nextension of the solar photosphere that is incompatible with observations and\nthe theory of stellar atmospheres. The problem of the height gradient of the\nmagnetic field in sunspots is still not solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 12:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

A common approach to estimate hazards\nposed by extreme sea levels is to use a statistical model, which may use a time\nseries of a climate variable as a covariate to modulate the statistical model\nand account for potentially nonstationary storm surge behavior. Previous work\nusing nonstationary statistical approaches, however, has demonstrated the\nimportance of accounting for the many inherent modeling uncertainties.\nAdditionally, previous assessments of coastal flood hazard using statistical\nmodeling have typically relied on a single climate covariate, which likely\nleaves out important processes and leads to potential biases. Here, I employ\nupon a recently developed approach to integrate stationary and nonstationary\nstatistical models, and examine the effects of choice of covariate time series\non projected flood hazard. Furthermore, I expand upon this approach by\ndeveloping a nonstationary storm surge statistical model that makes use of\nmultiple covariate time series: global mean temperature, sea level, North\nAtlantic Oscillation index and time. I show that a storm surge model that\naccounts for additional processes raises the projected 100-year storm surge\nreturn level by up to 23 centimeters relative to a stationary model or one that\nemploys a single covariate time series. I find that the total marginal model\nlikelihood associated with each set of nonstationary models given by the\ncandidate covariates, as well as a stationary model, is about 20%. These\nresults shed light on how best to account for potential nonstationary coastal\nsurge behavior, and incorporate more processes into surge projections. By\nincluding a wider range of physical process information and considering\nnonstationary behavior, these methods will better enable modeling efforts to\ninform coastal risk management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 13:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 23:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

We term this function the excluded volume function. Within the\ncontext of two-dimensional convex bodies, we investigate this excluded volume\nfunction for one-component systems addressing two related questions. Firstly,\ngiven a body can we find the excluded volume function?, Secondly, can we\nreconstruct a body from its excluded volume function? The former is readily\nanswered via an explicit Fourier series representation, in terms of the support\nfunction. However we show the latter question is ill-posed in the sense that\nsolutions are not unique for a large class of bodies. This degeneracy is well\ncharacterised however, with two bodies admitting the same excluded volume\nfunction if and only if the Fourier coefficients of their support functions\ndiffer only in phase. Despite the non-uniqueness issue, we then propose and\nanalyse a method for reconstructing a convex body given its excluded volume\nfunction, by means of a discretisation procedure where convex bodies are\napproximated by zonotopes with a fixed number of sides. It is shown that the\nalgorithm will always asymptotically produce a best $L^2$ approximation of the\ntrial function, within the space of excluded volume functions of centrally\nsymmetric bodies. In particular, if a solution exists, it can be found. Results\nfrom a numerical implementation are presented, showing that with only desktop\ncomputing power, good approximations to solutions can be readily found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 14:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Translation of\nTPM velocities from the scanner's reference coordinate system to the regional\ncardiac coordinate system requires decoupling of translational motion and\nmotion due to myocardial deformation. Despite existing techniques for\nrespiratory motion compensation in TPM, there is still a remaining\ntranslational velocity component due to the global motion of the beating heart.\nTo compensate for translational motion in cardiac TPM, we propose an\nimage-processing method, which we have evaluated on synthetic data and applied\non in vivo TPM data. Methods: Translational motion is estimated from a suitable\nregion of velocities automatically defined in the left-ventricular volume. The\nregion is generated by dilating the medial axis of myocardial masks in each\nslice and the translational velocity is estimated by integration in this\nregion.

The dynamical regime transitions that occur as day\nlength increases induce climate feedbacks producing cooler temperatures, first\nvia the reduction of water vapor with increasing rotation period despite\ndecreasing shortwave cooling by clouds, and then via decreasing water vapor and\nincreasing shortwave cloud cooling, except at the highest insolations.\nSimulations without OHT are more sensitive to insolation changes for fast\nrotations while slower rotations are relatively insensitive to ocean choice.\nOHT runs with faster rotations tend to be similar with gyres transporting heat\npoleward making them warmer than those without OHT. For slower rotations OHT is\ndirected equator-ward and no high latitude gyres are apparent. Uncertainties in\ncloud parameterization preclude a precise determination of habitability but do\nnot affect robust aspects of exoplanet climate sensitivity. This is the first\npaper in a series that will investigate aspects of habitability in the\nsimulations presented herein. The datasets from this study are opensource and\npublicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 14:51:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 13:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

For a given mass accretion rate onto the binary system,\nwe define a recipe for distributing this mass between the two components. For\nthis we introduce a parameter $\\eta$, such that\n$\\frac{\\dot{M}_2}{\\dot{M}_1}=q^\\eta$ at any time, to determine the binary mass\nratio evolution. Depending on the choice of $\\eta$, any type of mass ratio\nevolution is possible.

The first report\nof highly efficient organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells in 2012 marked a\nnew era for photovoltaics research, reporting a power conversion efficiency of\nover 10%. Only five years after this discovery, perovskite photovoltaic devices\nhave reached a certified efficiency of 22.7%, making them the first solution\nprocessable technology to surpass thin film and multi-crystalline silicon solar\ncells. The remarkable development of perovskite solar cells is due to the ideal\noptoelectronic properties of organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskites. The\nprototypical compound, methylammonium lead iodide, CH3NH3PbI3 is a direct band\ngap semiconductor with a band gap in the visible, high charge carrier mobility,\nlong diffusion length and low excitonic binding energy. Due to these ideal\nproperties, CH3NH3PbI3 is also drawing interest across many other applications\nbeyond photovoltaics, such as light emitting devices, lasers, photocatalysts\nand transistors. The continued progress of metal-halide perovskite\noptoelectronics relies not only on a detailed understanding of the electronic\nand optical properties of materials in this class, but also on the development\nof practical strategies to tune their properties by controlling parameters such\nas chemical composition. In this context, ab initio computational modelling can\nplay a key role in providing a physical interpretation of experimental\nmeasurements, and guiding the design of novel halide perovskites with tailored\nproperties.

The depletion of PUIs cools the heliosphere\ndownstream of the TS, \"deflating\" it and leading to a narrower HS and a smaller\nand rounder shape, in agreement with energetic neutral atom observations by the\nCassini spacecraft.

Fourier transform\ninfrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirms the presence of microscopic interactions\nsuch as polymer ion and ion ion interaction evidenced by a change in peak area\nof anion stretching mode. The fraction of free anions and ion pairs obtained\nfrom the analysis of FTIR implies that both influence the ionic conductivity\nwith different salt concentration. The complex dielectric permittivity,\ndielectric loss, complex conductivity have been analyzed and fitted in the\nentire frequency range (1 Hz to 1 MHz) at room temperature. The addition of\nsalt augments the dielectric constant and shift of relaxation peak in loss\ntangent plot toward high frequency indicates a decrease of relaxation time. We\nhave implemented the Sigma representation sigma double prime vs sigma prime for\nsolid lithium ion conducting films which provide better insight toward\nunderstating of the dispersion region in Cole Cole plot epsilon double prime vs\nepsilon prime in lower frequency window. The dielectric strength, relaxation\ntime and hopping frequency are in correlation with the conductivity which\nreveals the authenticity of results. Finally, the ion transport mechanism was\nproposed for getting the better understanding of the ion migration in the\npolymer matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 07:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Existing processing routes used\nto create pores of the desired geometry and degree of alignment appropriate for\nferroelectrets are based on complex mechanical stretching and chemical\ndissolution steps. As a simple, cost effective and environmentally friendly\napproach, freeze casting is able to produce aligned pores with almost all types\nof the materials, including polymers. In this work, we present the first\ndemonstration of freeze casting to create polymeric ferroelectrets. The pore\nmorphology, phase analysis, relative permittivity and direct piezoelectric\ncharge coefficient (d33) of porous poly(vinylidene fluoride (PVDF)\nferroelectrets with porosity volume fractions ranging from 24% to 78% were\nanalysed. The long-range alignment of pore channels produced during directional\nfreezing was shown to be beneficial in forming a highly polarised structure\nafter breakdown of air in the pore channels via corona poling. This new method\nopens a way to create tailored pores and voids in ferroelectret materials for\ntransducer applications related to sensors and vibration energy harvesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 08:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}
