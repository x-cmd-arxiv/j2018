At present, spatially resolved observations of this\ndiagnostic are rare and have not been reported as close to the disk center as\nfor $\\mu=0.6$. Our aim is to measure the scattering polarization in the Sr I\nline at $\\mu=0.6$ and to identify the spatial fluctuations with a statistical\napproach. Using the Fast Solar Polarimeter (FSP) mounted on the TESOS\nfiltergraph at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) in Tenerife, Spain, we\nmeasured both the spatially resolved full Stokes parameters of the Sr I line at\n$\\mu=0.6$ and the center-to-limb variation of the spatially averaged Stokes\nparameters.\n  We find that the center-to-limb variation of the scattering polarization in\nthe Sr I line measured with FSP is consistent with previous measurements. A\nstatistical analysis of Stokes $Q/I$ (i.e., the linear polarization component\nparallel to the solar limb), sampled with $0.16$\" pixel$^{-1}$ in the line core\nof Sr I reveals that the signal strength is inversely correlated with the\nintensity in the continuum. We find stronger linear polarimetric signals\ncorresponding to dark areas (intergranular lanes) in the Stokes $I$ continuum\nimage. In contrast, independent measurements at $\\mu=0.3$ show a positive\ncorrelation of $Q/I$ with respect to the continuum intensity. We estimate that\nthe patch diameter responsible for the excess $Q/I$ signal is on the order of\n$0.5$\"-$1$\".

A major challenge of traditional myoelectric control strategies\nusing surface electromyography electrodes has been the difficulty in achieving\nintuitive and robust proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom. In\nthis paper, we describe a new control method, proprioceptive sonomyographic\ncontrol that overcomes several limitations of myoelectric control. In\nsonomyography, muscle mechanical deformation is sensed using ultrasound, as\ncompared to electrical activation, and therefore the resulting control signals\ncan directly control the position of the end effector. Compared to myoelectric\ncontrol which controls the velocity of the end-effector device, sonomyographic\ncontrol is more congruent with residual proprioception in the residual limb. We\ntested our approach with 5 upper-extremity amputees and able-bodied subjects\nusing a virtual target achievement and holding task. Amputees and able-bodied\nparticipants demonstrated the ability to achieve positional control for 5\ndegrees of freedom with an hour of training.

Here, in few-layered WS2\ncoupled with plasmonic nanoparticle lattices, we observe the formation of a\ncollective polaritonic mode near the exciton energy and the formation of a\ncomplete polariton band gap with energy scale comparable to the exciton-plasmon\ncoupling strength. A coupled oscillator model reveals that the collective mode\narises from the cooperative coupling of the excitons to the plasmonic lattice\ndiffraction orders via exciton-exciton interactions. The emergence of the\ncollective mode is accompanied by a superlinear increase of the polariton mode\nsplitting as a function of the square root of the exciton oscillator strength.\nThe presence of these many body effects, which are enhanced in systems which\nlack bulk polarization, not only allows the formation of a collective mode with\nperiodically varying field profiles, but also further enhances the\nexciton-plasmon coupling.

To investigate\nthis paradox, we modeled LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapse. Nine\ndifferential equations describe the levels of positive and negative regulator\nproteins (PP and NP) and transitions among five discrete synaptic states, a\nbasal state (BAS), three E-LTP states (EP1, EP2, ED), and a L-LTP state (LP).

As a\ncomparison, we have also explored the evolution of supernova remnants in the\ndiffuse ISM with constant density. Since the hydrodynamics of SNRs is\nintimately related to the properties of their immediate environment, the\nlifecycle of dust grains in SNRs within SSCs is radically different from that\nin the diffuse ISM. Moreover, off-centered SNRs evolving in the steep density\ngradient established due to a star cluster wind experience a blowout phase:\nshell fragmentation due to protruding Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and the\nventing of SN ejecta.

It is caused by an asymmetry between the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions, which can be maintained at high energies when the\nchirality flipping rate can be neglected, for example in the early Universe.\nThe inclusion of the CME in the Maxwell equations leads to a modified set of\nMHD equations. We discuss how the CME is implemented in the PENCIL CODE. The\nCME plays a key role in the evolution of magnetic fields since it results in a\ndynamo effect associated with an additional term in the induction equation.\nThis term is formally similar to the $\\alpha$ effect in classical mean-field\nMHD. However, the chiral dynamo can operate without turbulence and is\nassociated with small spatial scales that can be, in the case of the early\nUniverse, orders of magnitude below the Hubble radius. A chiral $\\alpha_\\mu$\neffect has also been identified in mean-field theory. It occurs in the presence\nof turbulence but is not related to kinetic helicity. Depending on the plasma\nparameters, chiral dynamo instabilities can amplify magnetic fields over many\norders of magnitude. These instabilities can affect the propagation of MHD\nwaves, which is demonstrated by our DNS. We also study the coupling between the\nevolution of the chiral chemical potential and the ordinary chemical potential,\nwhich is proportional to the sum of the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions. An important consequence of this coupling is the\nemergence of chiral magnetic waves (CMWs). We confirm numerically that linear\nCMWs and MHD waves are not interacting.

Due to these features, many people believe that\nsmart contracts will revolutionize the way we think of distributed\napplications, information sharing, financial services, and infrastructures.\n  To release the potential of smart contracts, it is necessary to connect the\ncontracts with the outside world, such that they can understand and use\ninformation from other infrastructures.

Conventional heavy metals\nhave been extensively explored due to their strong SOC of conduction electrons.\nHowever, spin-orbit effects in classes of materials such as epitaxial\n5d-electron transition metal complex oxides, which also host strong SOC, remain\nlargely unreported. In addition to strong SOC, these complex oxides can also\nprovide the additional tuning knob of epitaxy to control the electronic\nstructure and the engineering of spin-to-charge conversion by crystalline\nsymmetry. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature generation of spin-orbit torque\non a ferromagnet with extremely high efficiency via the spin-Hall effect in\nepitaxial metastable perovskite SrIrO3. We first predict a large intrinsic\nspin-Hall conductivity in orthorhombic bulk SrIrO3 arising from the Berry\ncurvature in the electronic band structure. By manipulating the intricate\ninterplay between SOC and crystalline symmetry, we control the spin-Hall torque\nratio by engineering the tilt of the corner-sharing oxygen octahedra in\nperovskite SrIrO3 through epitaxial strain. This allows the presence of an\nanisotropic spin-Hall effect due to a characteristic structural anisotropy in\nSrIrO3 with orthorhombic symmetry. Our experimental findings demonstrate the\nheteroepitaxial symmetry design approach to engineer spin-orbit effects. We\ntherefore anticipate that these epitaxial 5d transition-metal oxide thin films\ncan be an ideal building block for low-power spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 18:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

A control method based on switch timing\nand input/output voltage measurements is developed to jointly achieve voltage\nregulation and input power factor control. A prototype design is implemented\nwith detailed measurements and waveforms shown to confirm the desired\nfunctionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 21:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

Typically these problems are solved\nnumerically using iterative methods. The local minimiserobtained using these\niterative methods usually depends on the choice of the initial iterate. Thus,\nthe estimated parameter and subsequent analyses using it depend on the choice\nof the initial iterate. One way to reduce the analysis bias due to the choice\nof the initial iterate is to repeat the algorithm from multiple initial\niterates (i.e. use a multi-start method). However, the procedure can be\ncomputationally intensive and is not always used in practice. To overcome this\nproblem, we propose the Cluster Gauss-Newton (CGN) method, an efficient\nalgorithm for finding multiple approximate minimisers of nonlinear-least\nsquares problems. CGN simultaneously solves the nonlinear least squares problem\nfrom multiple initial iterates. Then, CGN iteratively improves the solutions\nfrom these initial iterates similarly to the Gauss-Newton method. However, it\nuses a global linear approximation instead of the Jacobian. The global linear\napproximations are computed collectively among all the iterates to minimise the\ncomputational cost. We use physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models\nused in pharmaceutical drug development to demonstrate its use and show that\nCGN is computationally more efficient and more robust against local minima\ncompared to the standard Levenberg-Marquardt method, as well as state-of-the\nart multi-start and derivative-free methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 22:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 22:50:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 13:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 07:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

One wide-open problem\nin this area is to determine when a given code can be algorithmically drawn in\nthe plane as a Venn diagram-like figure. A sufficient condition to do so is for\nthe code to have a property called $k$-inductively pierced. Gross, Obatake, and\nYoungs recently used toric algebra to show that a code on three neurons is\n$1$-inductively pierced if and only if the toric ideal is trivial or generated\nby quadratics. No result is known for additional neurons in the same\ngenerality, part of the difficulty coming from the large number of codewords\npossible when additional neurons are used.\n  In this article, we study two infinite classes of combinatorial neural codes\nin detail. For each code, we explicitly compute its universal Gr\\\"obner basis.\nThis is done for the first class by recognizing that the codewords form a\nLawrence-type matrix. With the second class, this is done by showing that the\nmatrix is totally unimodular. These computations allow one to compute the state\npolytopes of the corresponding toric ideals, from which all distinct initial\nideals may be computed efficiently. Moreover, we show that the state polytopes\nare combinatorially equivalent to well-known polytopes: the permutohedron and\nthe stellohedron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 23:51:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 20:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

We demonstrate three modalities of information flow from time series X\nto time series Y. Intrinsic information flow exists when the past of X is\nindividually predictive of the present of Y, independent of Y's past; this is\nmost commonly considered information flow. Shared information flow exists when\nX's past is predictive of Y's present in the same manner as Y's past; this\noccurs due to synchronization or common driving, for example. Finally,\nsynergistic information flow occurs when neither X's nor Y's pasts are\npredictive of Y's present on their own, but taken together they are. The two\nmost broadly-employed information-theoretic methods of quantifying information\nflow---time-delayed mutual information and transfer entropy---are both\nsensitive to a pair of these modalities: time-delayed mutual information to\nboth intrinsic and shared flow, and transfer entropy to both intrinsic and\nsynergistic flow. To quantify each mode individually we introduce our\ncryptographic flow ansatz, positing that intrinsic flow is synonymous with\nsecret key agreement between X and Y. Based on this, we employ an\neasily-computed secret-key-agreement bound---intrinsic mutual\ninformation&mdashto quantify the three flow modalities in a variety of systems\nincluding asymmetric flows and financial markets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 00:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

A previously unknown quasi-steady\nstate is established by the interplay between mixing, turbulent transport, and\nnuclear burning. The resulting stellar structure has two burning shells within\na single convection zone. We find that the new neon burning layer covers an\nextended region of the convection zone, with the burning peak occurring\nsubstantially below where the Damk\\\"ohler number first becomes equal to unity.\nThese characteristics differ from those predicted by 1D stellar evolution\nmodels of similar ingestion events. We develop the mean-field turbulence\nequations that govern compositional evolution, and use them to interpret our\ndata set. An important byproduct is a means to quantify sub-grid-scale effects\nintrinsic to the numerical hydrodynamic scheme. For implicit large eddy\nsimulations, the analysis method is particularly powerful because it can reveal\nwhere and how simulated flows are modified by resolution, and provide\nstraightforward physical interpretations of the effects of dissipation or\ninduced transport. Focusing on the mean-field composition variance equations\nfor our analysis, we recover a Kolmogorov rate of turbulent dissipation without\nit being imposed, in agreement with previous results which used the turbulent\nkinetic energy equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 02:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Furthermore, in the field\nof array signal processing, direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation combined with\none-bit ADCs has gained growing interests recently to minimize the estimation\nerror. In this paper, a channel estimator is proposed for one-bit ADCs where\nthe channels are characterized by their angular geometries, e.g., uniform\nlinear arrays (ULAs). The goal is to estimate the dominant channel among\nmultiple paths. The proposed channel estimator first finds the DOA estimate\nusing the maximum inner product search (MIPS). Then, the channel fading\ncoefficient is estimated using the concavity of the log-likelihood function.\nThe limit inherent in one-bit ADCs is also investigated, which results from the\nloss of magnitude information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 04:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

However, the\nphysical mechanism for the H{\\alpha} emission is poorly understood. According\nto recent high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the\nflow accreting onto protoplanets, the disk gas flows down almost vertically\nonto and collides with the surface of a circum-planetary disk at a super-sonic\nvelocity and thus passes through a strong shockwave.

In this paper, we investigate the\nmodularity property of item keys, and systematically develop more accurate,\ncomposite hashing strategies, such as employing multiple independent hash\nfunctions that hash different modules in a key and their combinations\nseparately, instead of hashing the entire key directly into the sketch.\n  However, our problem of finding the best hashing strategy is non-trivial,\nsince there are exponential number of ways to combine the modules of a key\nbefore they can be hashed into the sketch.

The main\nissues of text-to-image synthesis lie in two gaps: the heterogeneous and\nhomogeneous gaps. The heterogeneous gap is between the high-level concepts of\ntext descriptions and the pixel-level contents of images, while the homogeneous\ngap exists between synthetic image distributions and real image distributions.\nFor addressing these problems, we exploit the excellent capability of generic\ndiscriminative models (e.g. VGG19), which can guide the training process of a\nnew generative model on multiple levels to bridge the two gaps. The high-level\nrepresentations can teach the generative model to extract necessary visual\ninformation from text descriptions, which can bridge the heterogeneous gap. The\nmid-level and low-level representations can lead it to learn structures and\ndetails of images respectively, which relieves the homogeneous gap. Therefore,\nwe propose Symmetrical Distillation Networks (SDN) composed of a source\ndiscriminative model as \"teacher\" and a target generative model as \"student\".\nThe target generative model has a symmetrical structure with the source\ndiscriminative model, in order to transfer hierarchical knowledge accessibly.\nMoreover, we decompose the training process into two stages with different\ndistillation paradigms for promoting the performance of the target generative\nmodel.

The mass-radius relations of neutron stars for all acceptable parameter\nsets shows a maximum mass in excess of $2M_\\odot$ being compatible with pulsar\nmass measurements. Given the constraints on the model in the low-density regime\ncoming from chiral effective theory, we find that the radius of a $1.4M_\\odot$\nneutron star is nearly independent on the value of $L$.

Extending the scope of\nPeierls instability to two (2D) or three dimensions (3D), however, is not\nstraightforward, since the Fermi surface in higher dimensions is generally not\nnested. In this work, we show that a perfectly nested Fermi surface can be\nrealized in a class of 2D perovskite oxides, giving rise to 2D Peierls\ninstability. Here the central role is played by the zone boundary Dirac line\nnode (DLN) protected by two orthogonal glide mirrors induced by the rotation of\noxygen octahedra. Especially, at a critical angle of the octahedron rotation,\nthe zone-boundary DLN flattens, leading to logarithmically diverging\nsusceptibility.

The goal of this study is to establish the effect of\nunresolved photospheric magnetic field structure on Stokes profiles observed\nwith relatively low spatial resolution. Ultimately, we aim to develop methods\nfor fast estimation of the photospheric magnetic filling factor and\nline-of-sight gradient of the photospheric magnetic field, which can be applied\nto large observational data sets. We exploit 3D MHD models of\nmagneto-convection developed using MURAM code.

The resulting I and V Stokes [x,y,$\\lambda$] cubes\nwith reduced spatial resolution of 150 km are used to calculate magnetic field\nvalues as they would be obtained in observations with Hinode/SOT or SDO/HMI.\nThree different methods of the magnetic filling factor estimation are\nconsidered: the magnetic line ratio method, Stokes V width method and a simple\nstatistical method. We find that the statistical method and the Stokes V width\nmethod are sufficiently reliable for fast filling factor estimations.\nFurthermore, we find that Stokes $I\\pm V$ bisector splitting gradient can be\nused for fast estimation of line-of-sight gradient of the photospheric magnetic\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 12:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Specifically,\nthe proposed SFP enables the pruned filters to be updated when training the\nmodel after pruning. SFP has two advantages over previous works: (1) Larger\nmodel capacity. Updating previously pruned filters provides our approach with\nlarger optimization space than fixing the filters to zero. Therefore, the\nnetwork trained by our method has a larger model capacity to learn from the\ntraining data. (2) Less dependence on the pre-trained model. Large capacity\nenables SFP to train from scratch and prune the model simultaneously. In\ncontrast, previous filter pruning methods should be conducted on the basis of\nthe pre-trained model to guarantee their performance. Empirically, SFP from\nscratch outperforms the previous filter pruning methods. Moreover, our approach\nhas been demonstrated effective for many advanced CNN architectures.

The spintronics explores the spin degree of electrons\nand thus bypasses the heat, at least in principle. For this reason, spin-based\ntechnology offers a possible solution.

But\nAOS only occurs in a special group of magnetic samples and within a narrow\nwindow of laser parameters. Some samples need multiple pulses to switch spins,\nwhile others need a single-shot pulse.

The dynamic radio spectrum\nshows that the high flux densities are not due to synchrotron emission of\nenergetic electrons, but to coherent emission processes, which produce a large\nvariety of rapidly varying short bursts (such as pulsations, fiber bursts, and\nzebra patterns).

In this paper,\nwe address this challenge and propose a multimodal convolutional neural network\nframework to predict the safety of a street intersection for crossing. Our\narchitecture consists of two subnetworks; an interaction-aware trajectory\nestimation stream IA-TCNN, that predicts the future states of all observed\ntraffic participants in the scene, and a traffic light recognition stream\nAtteNet. Our IA-TCNN utilizes dilated causal convolutions to model the behavior\nof the observable dynamic agents in the scene without explicitly assigning\npriorities to the interactions among them. While AtteNet utilizes\nSqueeze-Excitation blocks to learn a content-aware mechanism for selecting the\nrelevant features from the data, thereby improving the noise robustness.\nLearned representations from the traffic light recognition stream are fused\nwith the estimated trajectories from the motion prediction stream to learn the\ncrossing decision.

It is a fundamental problem in the\nmodeling of transport where the synthetic populations of micro-agents represent\na key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological\nframework for how to 'grow' pools of micro-agents is presented. The model\nframework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning\nbased on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population\nsynthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs\nsampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden\nMarkov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution\nfor high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional\nGibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary.\nIt is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the\nlow-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number\nof modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler\nessentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required\nconditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the\nVAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that\nare virtually different from those in the original data but have similar\nstatistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling\nat all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and\nmore detailed individual characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 14:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 17:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

In particular, each arrival is randomly dispatched to one of the\nservers whose queue lengths are below a threshold, if there are any; otherwise,\nthis arrival is randomly dispatched to one of the entire set of servers. We are\ninterested in the fundamental relationship between the threshold and the delay\nperformance of the system in heavy traffic. To this end, we first establish the\nfollowing necessary condition to guarantee heavy-traffic delay optimality: the\nthreshold will grow to infinity as the exogenous arrival rate approaches the\nboundary of the capacity region (i.e., the load intensity approaches one) but\nthe growth rate should be slower than a polynomial function of the mean number\nof tasks in the system. As a special case of this result, we directly show that\nthe delay performance of the popular pull-based policy Join-Idle-Queue (JIQ)\nlies strictly between that of any heavy-traffic delay optimal policy and that\nof random routing. We further show that a sufficient condition for\nheavy-traffic delay optimality is that the threshold grows logarithmically with\nthe mean number of tasks in the system.

It is designed for problems where the objective function is\nexpensive to evaluate, perhaps not available in exact form, without gradient\ninformation and possibly returning noisy values. Different versions of the\nalgorithm vary in the choice of the acquisition function, which recommends the\npoint to query the objective at next. Initially, researchers focused on\nimprovement-based acquisitions, while recently the attention has shifted to\nmore computationally expensive information-theoretical measures. In this paper\nwe present two major contributions to the literature. First, we propose a new\nimprovement-based acquisition function that recommends query points where the\nimprovement is expected to be high with high confidence. The proposed algorithm\nis evaluated on a large set of benchmark functions from the global optimization\nliterature, where it turns out to perform at least as well as current\nstate-of-the-art acquisition functions, and often better. This suggests that it\nis a powerful default choice for BO. The novel policy is then compared to\nwidely used global optimization solvers in order to confirm that BO methods\nreduce the computational costs of the optimization by keeping the number of\nfunction evaluations small. The second main contribution represents an\napplication to precision medicine, where the interest lies in the estimation of\nparameters of a partial differential equations model of the human pulmonary\nblood circulation system. Once inferred, these parameters can help clinicians\nin diagnosing a patient with pulmonary hypertension without going through the\nstandard invasive procedure of right heart catheterization, which can lead to\nside effects and complications (e.g. severe pain, internal bleeding,\nthrombosis).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 14:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-22"}

We present a comprehensive study of the static\nmagnetism and low-energy pseudospin dynamics in the archetypal spin-orbit Mott\ninsulator Sr2IrO4. We find that in order to understand even basic magnetization\nmeasurements, a formerly overlooked in-plane anisotropy is fundamental. In\naddition to magnetometry, we use neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron\nscattering and resonant elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering to identify and\nquantify the interactions that determine the global symmetry of the system and\ngovern the linear responses of pseudospins to external magnetic felds and their\nlow-energy dynamics. We find that a pseudospin-only Hamiltonian is insufficient\nfor an accurate description of the magnetism in Sr2IrO4 and that\npseudospin-lattice coupling is essential. This finding should be generally\napplicable to other pseudospin systems with sizable orbital moments sensitive\nto anisotropic crystalline environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 14:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 09:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Chamaeleon I represents an ideal laboratory to study the cluster\nformation in a low-mass environment.

In this letter we report new\ninsights into the structural properties, age, and distance of Chamaeleon I\nbased on the astrometric parameters from Gaia data-release 2 (DR2). Methods. We\nidentified 140 sources with a reliable counterpart in the Gaia DR2 archive. We\ndetermined the median distance of the cluster using Gaia parallaxes and fitted\nthe distribution of parallaxes and proper motions assuming the presence of two\nclusters. We derived the probability of each single source of belonging to the\nnorthern or southern sub-clusters, and compared the HR diagram of the most\nprobable members to pre-main sequences isochrones. Results. The median distance\nof Chamaeleon I is ~190 pc. This is about 20 pc larger than the value commonly\nadopted in the literature. From a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the parallaxes and\nproper-motion distributions we conclude that the northern and southern clusters\ndo not belong to the same parent population. The northern population has a\ndistance dN = 192.7+/-0.4 pc, while the southern one dS = 186.5+/-0.7 pc. The\ntwo sub-clusters appear coeval, at variance with literature results, and most\nof the sources are younger than 3 Myr.

Fano in the 1940s, the statistical fluctuation of\nthe number of pairs produced in an ionizing interaction is known to be\nsub-Poissonian. The dispersion is reduced by the so-called \"Fano factor\", which\nempirically encapsulates the correlations in the process of ionization. In\nmodelling the energy response of an ionization measurement device, the effect\nof the Fano factor is commonly folded into the overall energy resolution. While\nsuch an approximate treatment is appropriate when a significant number of\nionization pairs are expected to be produced, the Fano factor needs to be\naccounted for directly at the level of pair creation when only a few are\nexpected. To do so, one needs a discrete probability distribution of the number\nof pairs created $N$ with independent control of both the expectation $\\mu$ and\nFano factor $F$. Although no distribution $P(N|\\mu,F)$ with this convenient\nform exists, we propose the use of the COM-Poisson distribution together with\nstrategies for utilizing it to effectively fulfill this need. We then use this\ndistribution to assess the impact that the Fano factor may have on the\nsensitivity of low-mass WIMP search experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:29:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 22:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

For a monoenergetic muon beam crossing\nan object, the scattering angle follows a Gaussian distribution with a zero\nmean value and a variance that depends on the atomic number of the material\nobject it traversed. Thus, the measured scattering angle may be used to\nreconstruct the geometrical and material information of the contents inside the\ndry storage cask.\n  In traditional X-ray computed tomography, the projection information used to\nreconstruct the attenuation map of the imaged objects is the negative natural\nlogarithm of the transmission rate of the X-rays, which is equal to the linear\nsummation of the X-ray attenuation coefficients along the incident path.\nSimilarly, the variance of the muon scattering angle is also the linear\nintegral of the scattering density of the objects crossed by the muons. Thus, a\nmuon CT image can be built by equating scattering density with attenuation\ncoefficient. However, muon CT faces some unique challenges including: 1) long\nmeasurement times due to low cosmic muon flux, 2) insufficiently accurate muon\npath models, and 3) the inability to precisely measuring muon momentum.\n  In this work, three different muon path models, two different projection\nmethods, and two different reconstruction methods were investigated for use in\nmuon CT of dry storage casks.

A new perspective for measuring\nthe susceptibility of the system to cascading failures is clearly needed. The\nnewly developed concept of system stress metrics may be able to provide new\ninsights into this problem. The method measures stress as susceptibility to\ncascading failures by analyzing the network structure and electrical\nproperties. This paper investigates the effectiveness of transmission switching\nin reducing the risk of cascading failures, measured in system stress metrics.\nBased on line-outage distribution factors, an algorithm is developed to\nidentify and test the switching candidates quickly. A case study analyzing\ndifferent stress metrics on the IEEE 118-bus test system is presented. The\nresults show that transmission switching identified by our proposed algorithm\ncould be used in preventive as well as corrective mechanisms to reduce the\nsystem's susceptibility to cascading failures. Contrary to the conventional\noperation wisdom that switching lines out of service jeopardizes reliability,\nour results suggest the opposite; system operators can often use transmission\nswitching, when the system is under stress, as a tool to reduce the risk of\ncascading failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 01:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 00:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

Due to the complexity of real chemistry, a single-step\nreaction mechanism is usually used for theoretical and numerical studies. The\npurpose of this study is to look more deeply into the influence of chemistry on\ndetonation initiated by a spontaneous wave. Results of high resolution\nsimulations performed for one-step models are compared with simulations for\ndetailed chemical models for highly reactive and low reactive mixtures. The\ncalculated induction times for H2/air and for CH4/air are validated against\nexperimental measurements for a wide range of temperatures and pressures. It is\nfound that the requirements in terms of temperature and size of the hot spots,\nwhich produce a spontaneous wave capable to initiate detonation, are\nquantitatively and qualitatively different for one-step models compared to the\ndetailed chemical models. The impact of detailed chemical model is particularly\npronounced for the methane-air mixture. In this case, not only the hot spot\nsize is much greater than that predicted by a one-step model, but even at\nelevated pressure the initiation of detonation by a temperature gradient is\npossible only if the temperature outside the gradient is so high, that can\nignite thermal explosion. The obtained results suggest that the one-step models\ndo not reproduce correctly the transient and ignition processes, so that\ninterpretation of the simulations performed using a one-step model for\nunderstanding mechanisms of flame acceleration, DDT and the origin of\nexplosions must be considered with great caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 11:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}
