Compared with traditional methods such as\nnuclear medicine ventilation-perfusion (VQ), positron emission tomography\n(PET), single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT), or magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), which use contrast agents to form 2D or 3D functional\nimages, ventilation imaging obtained from 4DCT lung images is convenient and\ncost-effective because of its availability during radiation treatment planning.\nCurrent methods of obtaining ventilation images from 4DCT lung images involve\ndeformable image registration (DIR) and a density (HU) change-based algorithm\n(DIR/HU); therefore the resulting ventilation images are sensitive to the\nselection of DIR algorithms. Methods: We propose a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN)-based method to derive the ventilation images from 4DCT directly\nwithout explicit DIR, thereby improving consistency and accuracy of ventilation\nimages. A total of 82 sets of 4DCT and ventilation images from patients with\nlung cancer were studied using this method. Results: The predicted images were\ncomparable to the label images of the test data. The similarity index and\ncorrelation coefficient averaged over the ten-fold cross validation were\n0.883+-0.034 and 0.878+-0.028, respectively. Conclusions: The results\ndemonstrate that deep CNN can generate ventilation imaging from 4DCT without\nexplicit deformable image registration, reducing the associated uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 16:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Several works have previously addressed the problems\nassociated with the calibration of such models, highlighting in particular the\nissue of model parameter estimation and model equifinality. In this work, we\ninvestigate the problem of model calibration using the active subspace (AS)\nmethod, a novel tool for model parameter dimension reduction. We apply the\nmethod to a newly proposed hydrological model for karst aquifers, LuKARS, to\ninvestigate if the AS framework identifies catchment-specific characteristics\nor if the results only depend on the chosen model structure. Therefore, we\nconsider four different case studies, three synthetic and one real case\n(Kerschbaum springshed in Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs, Austria), with varying hydrotope\ndistributions and properties. We find that both the hydrotope area coverage and\nthe catchment characteristics have major impacts on parameter sensitivities.\nWhile model parameters are similarly informed in scenarios with less varying\ncatchment characteristics, we find significant differences in parameter\nsensitivities when the applied hydrotopes were different from each other. Our\nresults show that the AS method can be used to investigate the relation between\nthe model structure, the area of a hydrotope, the physical properties of a\ncatchment and the discharge data. Finally, we successfully effectively reduce\nthe parameter dimensions of the LuKARS model for the Kerschbaum case study\nusing the AS method. The model with reduced parameter dimensions is able to\nreproduce the observed impacts of land use changes in the Kerschbaum\nspringshed, highlighting the robustness of the hydrotope-based modeling\napproach of LuKARS and its applicability for land use change impact studies in\nkarstic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 16:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 15:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

A challenge is that an echo is\nfaint relative to the flare and measurement noise. Here, we use a method, based\non autocorrelation function estimation, to extract faint planetary echoes from\nstellar flare light curves. A key component of our approach is that we\ncompensate for planetary motion, measures of echo strength are then co-added\ninto a strong signal. Using simple flare models in simulations, we explore the\nfeasibility of this method with current technology for detecting planets around\nnearby M dwarfs.

A Mott insulator\nsubjected to a uniform and static electric field is prototypical, raising key\nquestions such as the fate of Bloch oscillations with increasing correlation\nstrength, the approach to a steady state DC transport regime and the role of\ndissipation in it, and electric field driven phase transitions. We develop here\nan effective large-N Keldysh field theory for studying nonequilibrium transport\nin a regular one-dimensional dissipative Mott insulator system subjected to a\nuniform electric field. Upon abruptly turning on the electric field (a quench),\na transient oscillatory current response reminiscent of Bloch oscillations is\nfound. In the regime of small tunneling conductance the amplitude of these\noscillations, over a large time window, decreases as an inverse square\npower-law in time, ultimately going over to an exponential decay beyond a large\ncharacteristic time that increases with N. Such a relaxation to a steady state\nDC response is absent in the dissipation free Hubbard chain at half filling.\nThe steady state current at small fields is governed by large distance\ncotunneling, a process absent in the equilibrium counterpart. The low-field DC\ncurrent has a Landau-Zener-Schwinger form but qualitatively differs from the\nexpression for pair-production probability for the dissipation free\ncounterpart. The breakdown of perturbation theory in the Mott phase possibly\nsignals a nonequilibrium phase transition to a metallic phase. Our study sheds\nlight on the approach of a driven, dissipative strongly correlated system to a\nnonequilibrium steady state and also provides a general analytic microscopic\nframework for understanding other nonequilibrium phenomena in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 18:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 13:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

The exact conditions and\nmechanisms under which YMCs form remain unknown -- a fact further complicated\nby the extreme radiation fields produced by their numerous massive young stars.\nHere we show that GC-sized clusters are naturally produced in\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulations of isolated 10$^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ Giant\nMolecular Clouds (GMCs) with properties typical of the local universe, even\nunder the influence of radiative feedback. In all cases, these massive clusters\ngrow to GC-level masses within 5 Myr via a roughly equal combination of\nfilamentary gas accretion and mergers with several less massive clusters.\nLowering the heavy-element abundance of the GMC by a factor of 10 reduces the\nopacity of the gas to radiation and better represents the high-redshift\nformation conditions of GCs. This results in higher gas accretion leading to a\nmass increase of the largest cluster by a factor of ~4. When combined with\nsimulations of less massive GMCs (10$^{4-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$), a clear relation\nemerges between the maximum YMC mass and the mass of the host GMC. Our results\ndemonstrate that YMCs, and potentially GCs, are a simple extension of local\ncluster formation to more massive clouds and do not require suggested exotic\nformation scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 18:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

Here we test two simple and opposite extremes for the injection\nof enriched material into the intracluster gas: we assume either continuous\ninjection in a way that tracks the star formation rate; or sudden injection by\na single instantaneous event. Using helium abundance as a proxy for the\nenrichment, we find that realistic multiple population features can be\nreproduced by injecting a total helium mass amounting to a few percent of the\ncluster's total mass. The differences in individual growth histories can lead\nto widely differing 1P/2P outcomes.

For mechanical reasons, these\ncolor separations are generally not perfectly aligned with respect to each\nother when they are rendered by their respective imaging stations. This\nphenomenon, called color plane misregistration, causes gap and halo artifacts\nin the printed image. Color trapping is an image processing technique that aims\nto reduce these artifacts by modifying the susceptible edge boundaries to\ncreate small, unnoticeable overlaps between the color planes. We propose three\nlow-complexity algorithms for automatic color trapping which hide the effects\nof small color plane mis-registrations. Our algorithms are designed for\nsoftware or embedded firmware implementation. The trapping method they follow\nis based on a hardware-friendly technique proposed by J. Trask (JTHBCT03) which\nis too computationally expensive for software or firmware implementation. The\nfirst two algorithms are based on the use of look-up tables (LUTs).

On the other hand it has long been known that if the\nalignment consists of all the characters that correspond to edges of a\nparticular tree, i.e. they all require exactly $k=1$ substitution to be\nrealized on that tree, then this tree will be recovered by maximum parsimony\nmethods. This is based on Buneman's theorem in mathematical phylogenetics.

However, both methods require\nmodel-dependent distance measures to place the galaxies or to differentiate\npeculiar velocity from the Hubble expansion. In this paper, we use the\ncorrelated proper motions of galaxy pairs from the VLBA Extragalactic Proper\nMotion Catalog to place limits on the transverse peculiar velocity of galaxy\npairs with comoving separations <1500 Mpc without a reliance on precise\ndistance measurements. The relative proper motions of galaxy pairs across the\nline of sight can be directly translated into relative peculiar velocities\nbecause no proper motion will occur in a homogeneous expansion.

Our city is constituted\ninitially by a set of streets that form a regular tessellation of the euclidean\nplane. Therefore we will have three types of cities, formed by squares,\ntriangles or hexagons. We studied the complementary cumulative distribution\nfunction for displacements (CCDF). For the whole set of streets the CCDF is a\nstretched exponential, and as streets are deleted this function becomes a\nlinear function and then two clear different exponentials. This behavior is\nqualitatively the same for all the tessellations. Most of this functions has\nbeen reported in the literature when studying the displacements of individuals\nbased on cell data trajectories and GPS information. However, in the light of\nthis work, the appearance of different functions for displacements CCDF can be\nattributed to the connectivity of the underlying street network. It is\nremarkably that for some proportion of streets we got a linear function for\nsuch function, and as far as we know this behavior has not been reported nor\nconsidered. Therefore, it is advisable to analyze experimental in the light of\nconnectivity of the street network to make correlations with the present work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

The\nintroduction of reconfigurable antennas offers an additional degree of freedom\non designing mmWave MIMO systems. This paper provides a theoretical framework\nfor studying the mmWave MIMO with reconfigurable antennas. Based on the virtual\nchannel model, we present an architecture of reconfigurable mmWave MIMO with\nbeamspace hybrid analog-digital beamformers and reconfigurable antennas at both\nthe transmitter and the receiver. We show that employing reconfigurable\nantennas can provide throughput gain for the mmWave MIMO. We derive the\nexpression for the average throughput gain of using reconfigurable antennas in\nthe system, and further derive the expression for the outage throughput gain\nfor the scenarios where the channels are (quasi) static. Moreover, we propose a\nlow-complexity algorithm for reconfiguration state selection and beam\nselection.

Functional characteristics of the haemostatic system in neonates and\nchildren are significantly different compared with adults; at the same time\nplasma levels of haemostatic proteins vary considerably with age.

From our model we observe that two\ncommonly used metrics for haemostatic activity are significantly lower in\nneonates than in older patients. Because both metrics are strongly determined\nby prothrombin and prothrombin levels are considerably lower in neonates we\nconclude that decreased haemostatic activity in neonates is due to lower\nprothrombin availability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

The low energy hard phonon modes are characterized by\nfluorite-like layers experiencing transverse displacements and large changes in\nBorn effective charges on Bi atoms.

In this study, experiments were conducted to assess the precision\nand accuracy of bootstrapped and single-fit ELEFAN-based curve fitting methods,\nusing synthetic LFDs with known input parameters and a real data set of Abra\nalba shell lengths. The comparison of several types of bootstrap experiments\nand their outputs (95% confidence intervals and confidence contour plots)\nprovided a first glimpse into the accuracy of modern ELEFAN-based fit methods.\nThe main components of uncertainty (precision and reproducibility of fit\nalgorithms, seed effects, sample size and matrix information content) could be\nassessed from partial bootstraps.

The space of parameters consisting of\nweights and biases is a Riemannian manifold, where the metric is defined by the\nFisher information matrix. The natural gradient method uses the steepest\ndescent direction in a Riemannian manifold, so it is effective in learning,\navoiding plateaus. It requires inversion of the Fisher information matrix,\nhowever, which is practically impossible when the matrix has a huge number of\ndimensions. Many methods for approximating the natural gradient have therefore\nbeen introduced. The present paper uses statistical neurodynamical method to\nreveal the properties of the Fisher information matrix in a net of random\nconnections under the mean field approximation.

These phenomena have been explained by invoking 2$e$\nfluctuations of the valence of the Tl dopants but a direct measurement of the\nmixed-valency implied by such a mechanism has not been reported to date. In\nthis work we present the unambiguous observation of multiple valences of Tl in\nTl-doped PbTe via photo emission spectroscopy measurements. It is shown via our\nquantitative analysis that the suppression of the carrier density at\ncompositions exhibiting superconductivity and Kondo-like behaviour is fully\naccounted for by mixed valency, thus arguing strongly against a\nself-compensation scenario proposed elsewhere for this material and\nstrengthening the case for valence fluctuation models.

This decision rules are\nimplicitly assuming some form of surrogacy between tumor response and long-term\nendpoints like progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). The\nsurrogacy is most often assessed as weak, but sufficient to allow a rapid\ndecision making as early phase studies lack the survival follow up and number\nof patients to properly assess PFS or OS. With the emergence of therapies with\nnew mechanisms of action, for which the link between RECIST tumor response and\nlong-term endpoints is either not accessible yet because not enough data is\navailable to perform a meta-regression, or the link is weaker than with\nclassical chemotherapies, tumor response based rules may not be optimal. In\nthis paper, we explore the use of a multistate model for decision making based\non single-arm early phase trials. The multistate model allows to account for\nmore information than the simple RECIST response status, namely, the time to\nget to response, the duration of response, the PFS time and time to death. We\npropose to base the decision on efficacy on the OS hazard ratio (HR), predicted\nfrom a multistate model based on early phase data with limited survival\nfollow-up, combined with historical control data. Using three case studies and\nsimulations, we illustrate the feasibility of the estimation of the OS HR using\na multistate model based on limited data from early phase studies. We argue\nthat, in the presence of limited follow up and small sample size, and on\nassumptions within the multistate model, the OS prediction is acceptable and\nmay lead to better decisions for continuing the development of a drug.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 05:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

Existing methods, no matter based on\nreinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms (EA), conduct architecture\nsearch in a discrete space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we\npropose a simple and efficient method to automatic neural architecture design\nbased on continuous optimization. We call this new approach neural architecture\noptimization (NAO). There are three key components in our proposed approach:\n(1) An encoder embeds/maps neural network architectures into a continuous\nspace. (2) A predictor takes the continuous representation of a network as\ninput and predicts its accuracy. (3) A decoder maps a continuous representation\nof a network back to its architecture. The performance predictor and the\nencoder enable us to perform gradient based optimization in the continuous\nspace to find the embedding of a new architecture with potentially better\naccuracy. Such a better embedding is then decoded to a network by the decoder.\nExperiments show that the architecture discovered by our method is very\ncompetitive for image classification task on CIFAR-10 and language modeling\ntask on PTB, outperforming or on par with the best results of previous\narchitecture search methods with a significantly reduction of computational\nresources.

One aspect of emotion is reflected in the language we use. How\nto represent emotions in texts is a challenge in natural language processing\n(NLP). Although continuous vector representations like word2vec have become the\nnew norm for NLP problems, their limitations are that they do not take emotions\ninto consideration and can unintentionally contain bias toward certain\nidentities like different genders.\n  This thesis focuses on improving existing representations in both word and\nsentence levels by explicitly taking emotions inside text and model bias into\naccount in their training process. Our improved representations can help to\nbuild more robust machine learning models for affect-related text\nclassification like sentiment/emotion analysis and abusive language detection.\n  We first propose representations called emotional word vectors (EVEC), which\nis learned from a convolutional neural network model with an emotion-labeled\ncorpus, which is constructed using hashtags. Secondly, we extend to learning\nsentence-level representations with a huge corpus of texts with the pseudo task\nof recognizing emojis. Our results show that, with the representations trained\nfrom millions of tweets with weakly supervised labels such as hashtags and\nemojis, we can solve sentiment/emotion analysis tasks more effectively.\n  Lastly, as examples of model bias in representations of existing approaches,\nwe explore a specific problem of automatic detection of abusive language. We\naddress the issue of gender bias in various neural network models by conducting\nexperiments to measure and reduce those biases in the representations in order\nto build more robust classification models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 06:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

Most of the nearest-neighbor spin correlations are independent of the\ndetails of evolution, due to the formation of rigid domains.

LASSO\n(Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a popular sparse modeling\nmethod while it has been known to yield unexpected large bias especially at a\nsparse representation. There have been several studies for improving this\nproblem such as the introduction of non-convex regularization terms. The\nimportant point is that this bias problem directly affects model selection in\napplications since a sparse representation cannot be selected by a prediction\nerror based model selection even if it is a good representation. In this\narticle, we considered to improve this problem by introducing a scaling that\nexpands LASSO estimator to compensate excessive shrinkage, thus a large bias in\nLASSO estimator. We here gave an empirical value for the amount of scaling.\nThere are two advantages of this scaling method as follows. Since the proposed\nscaling value is calculated by using LASSO estimator, we only need LASSO\nestimator that is obtained by a fast and stable optimization procedure such as\nLARS (Least Angle Regression) under LASSO modification or coordinate descent.\nAnd, the simplicity of our scaling method enables us to derive SURE (Stein's\nUnbiased Risk Estimate) under the modified LASSO estimator with scaling. Our\nscaling method together with model selection based on SURE is fully empirical\nand do not need additional hyper-parameters. In a simple numerical example, we\nverified that our scaling method actually improves LASSO and the SURE based\nmodel selection criterion can stably choose an appropriate sparse model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 07:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

The problem of training a deep net on a few or one sample per class\nrequires a different learning approach which can generalize to unseen classes\nusing only a few representatives of these classes. This problem has previously\nbeen approached by meta-learning. Here we propose a novel meta-learner which\nshows state-of-the-art performance on common benchmarks for one/few shot\nclassification. Our model features three novel components: First is a\nfeed-forward embedding that takes random class support samples (after a\ncustomary CNN embedding) and transfers them to a better class representation in\nterms of a classification problem. Second is a novel attention mechanism,\ninspired by competitive learning, which causes class representatives to compete\nwith each other to become a temporary class prototype with respect to the query\npoint. This mechanism allows switching between representatives depending on the\nposition of the query point. Once a prototype is chosen for each class, the\npredicated label is computed using a simple attention mechanism over prototypes\nof all considered classes. The third feature is the ability of our meta-learner\nto incorporate deeper CNN embedding, enabling larger capacity. Finally, to ease\nthe training procedure and reduce overfitting, we averages the top $t$ models\n(evaluated on the validation) over the optimization trajectory. We show that\nthis approach can be viewed as an approximation to an ensemble, which saves the\nfactor of $t$ in training and test times and the factor of of $t$ in the\nstorage of the final model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 08:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

Swirl distortions, caused by non-uniformities in\nflows arising from boundary layer or ground/fuselage vortex ingestion are of\nconcern and need to be fully understood to guarantee efficiency and safety of\npropulsion systems. To investigate a fundamental single-vortex distortion\ndevelopment in a duct at different Reynolds numbers, a StreamVane distortion\ngenerating device was designed and experimentally analyzed in a small-scale\nlow-speed wind tunnel (ReD 500,000) and in a full-scale engine testing rig (ReD\n3 million). Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry was used to measure the\nthree-component velocity fields at discrete measurement planes downstream of\nthe distortion device. Results show that the secondary flow is generated and\ndevelops very similarly in both scales, and is mostly driven by two-dimensional\n(2D) vortex dynamics. Induced velocities arising from the proximity of the\nvortex to the duct wall causes the vortex center to convect circumferentially\naround the duct, in the same sense as the vortex rotation, as it travels\ndownstream. Small-scale turbulence results show small-scale instabilities\nrelated to the development of the vortex.

Instead of comparisons bin by bin, EMD\nallows to compare signal intensities across different coordinates. This measure\nhas great potential to account for time and space shifts of events within\nseismograms. However, there are two main challenges in application of EMD to\nFWI. The first one is that the compared signals need to satisfy nonnegativity\nand mass conservation assumptions. The second one is that the computation of\nEMD between two seismograms is a computationally expensive problem. In this\npaper, a strategy is used to satisfy the two assumptions via decomposition and\nrecombination of original seismic data. In addition, the computation of EMD\nbased on dynamic formulation is formulated as a convex optimization problem. A\nprimal-dual hybrid gradient method with linesearch has been developed to solve\nthis large-scale optimization problem on GPU device. The advantages of the new\nmethod are that it is easy to implement and has high computational efficiency.\nCompared to LSD based FWI, the computation time of the proposed method will\napproximately increase by 11% in our case studies. A 1D time-shift signals case\nstudy has indicated that EMD is more effective in capturing time shift and\nmakes the misfit function more convex. Two applications to synthetic data using\ntransmissive and reflective recording geometries have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of EMD in mitigating cycle-skipping issues. We have also applied\nthe proposed method to SEG 2014 benchmark data, which has further demonstrated\nthat EMD can mitigate local minima and provide reliable velocity estimations\nwithout using low frequency information in the recorded data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 08:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

We plotted the corresponding observational data together, finding a\nstatistically significant correlation that spans ~ 16 orders of magnitude. This\nprobably represents one of the widest ranges of any empirical correlation\nknown, encompassing galaxies that are several kpc in size, pc-size star-forming\nclouds within our Galaxy, down to young, pre-main sequence stars with au-size\nprotoplanetary disks. We propose a bottom-up hypothesis suggesting that a\nrelation between Macc and the total circumstellar mass surrounding Class 0/I\nsources (Mcs; disk+envelope) drives the correlation in protostellar-hosting\nclouds and cloud-hosting galaxies. This is consistent with the fact that the\nSFRs derived for clouds over a timescale of 2 Myr can be roughly recovered from\nthe sum of instantaneous Macc values of the protostars embedded within them,\nimplying that galactic SFRs averaged over ~ 10-100 Myr should be constant over\nthis period too. Moreover, the sum of the Mcs values directly participating in\nthe formation of the protostellar population in a cloud likely represents a\nnon-negligible fraction of the Mdg within the cloud. If such fraction is ~\n1-35% of the Mdg associated with star-forming clouds and galaxies, then the\nglobal correlation for all scales has a near unity slope and an intercept\nconsistent with the (proto-)stellar accretion timescale, Mcs/Macc. Therefore,\nan additional critical test of our hypothesis is that the Macc-Mdisk\ncorrelation for Class II stars should also be observed between Macc and Mcs for\nClass 0/I sources with similar slope and intercept.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 09:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

In order to study its main properties, Gromov himself initiated\nthe dual theory of bounded cohomology, that developed into an active and\nindependent research field. Gromov's theory of bounded cohomology was based on\nthe use of multicomplexes, which are simplicial structures that generalize\nsimplicial complexes without allowing all the degeneracies appearing in\nsimplicial sets.\n  In the first part of this paper we lay the foundation of the theory of\nmulticomplexes. We construct the singular multicomplex K(X) associated to a\ntopological space X, and we prove that K(X) is homotopy equivalent to $X$ for\nevery CW complex X. Following Gromov, we introduce the notion of completeness,\nwhich translates into the context of multicomplexes the Kan condition for\nsimplicial sets. We then develop the homotopy theory of complete\nmulticomplexes.\n  In the second part we apply the theory of multicomplexes to the study of the\nbounded cohomology of topological spaces. We provide complete proofs of\nGromov's Mapping Theorem (which implies that the bounded cohomology of a space\nonly depends on its fundamental group) and of Gromov's Vanishing Theorem, which\nensures the vanishing of the simplicial volume of closed manifolds admitting an\namenable cover of small multiplicity.\n  The third part is devoted to the study of locally finite chains on\nnon-compact spaces. We expand some ideas of Gromov to provide complete proofs\nof a criterion for the vanishing and a criterion for the finiteness of the\nsimplicial volume of open manifolds. As a by-product of these results, we prove\na criterion for the l^1-invisibility of closed manifolds in terms of amenable\ncovers. As an application, we give the first complete proof of the vanishing of\nthe simplicial volume of the product of three open manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 10:45:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 10:24:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 14:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

We revisit the question of the SMBH charge and put\nrealistic limits on its value, timescales of charging and discharging, and\nobservable consequences of the potential, small charge associated with the\nGalactic centre black hole. The electric charge due to classical arguments\nbased on the mass difference between protons and electrons is $\\lesssim\n10^9\\,{\\rm C}$ and is of a transient nature on the viscous time-scale.

Even a\nsmall charge of this order significantly shifts the position of the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO) of charged particles.

Using complementary tools (analytic\nand numerical) we study systematically the self-assembly of the point charges\ninto ordered ground state configurations as the inter-layer separation and the\nasymmetry in the charge densities are varied. The overwhelming plethora of\nemerging Wigner bilayer ground states can be understood in terms of the\ncompetition of two strategies of the system: the desire to guarantee net charge\nneutrality on each of the plates and the effort of the particles to\nself-organize into commensurate sublattices.

The\nimproved suppression factors presented here, although highly approximate, allow\nsummed recombination rate coefficients to be used to intermediate densities.\nThere have been several technical improvements to our previously presented\nfits. For H- through B-like ions the activation log densities have been\nadjusted to better reproduce existing data. For B-, C-, Al-, and Si-like ions\nsecondary autoionization is now included.

Even though the measured suppression factors for hadrons and\njets differ significantly from one another and appear to asymptote to different\nvalues in the high energy limit, we obtain a simultaneous description of all\nthese data after constraining the value of a single model parameter. We use our\nmodel to investigate the origin of the difference between the observed\nsuppression of jets and hadrons and relate it, quantitatively, to the observed\nmodification of the jet fragmentation function in jets that have been modified\nby passage through the medium produced in heavy ion collisions. In particular,\nthe observed increase in the fraction of hard fragments in medium-modified\njets, which indicates that jets with the fewest hardest fragments lose the\nleast energy, corresponds quantitatively to the observed difference between the\nsuppression of hadrons and jets. We argue that a harder fragmentation pattern\nfor jets with a given energy after quenching is a generic feature of any\nmechanism for the interaction between jets and the medium that they traverse\nthat yields a larger suppression for wider jets. We also compare the results of\nour global fit to LHC data to measurements of the suppression of high energy\nhadrons in RHIC collisions, and find that with its parameter chosen to fit the\nLHC data our model is inconsistent with the RHIC data at the $3\\sigma$ level,\nsuggesting that hard probes interact more strongly with the less hot\nquark-gluon plasma produced at RHIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 14:41:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks.

With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable.

A semi-analytical model is\ndeveloped in order to study the influence of various parameters such as the\nmaterial Poisson's coefficient, the step-like thickness, the frequency and the\nincidence angle. To this end, all the Lamb and shear horizontal propagating\nmodes, but also a large number of their inhomogeneous and evanescent\ncounterpart,s are taken into account.

We describe a\nmethod to generate fillings with such chords, lines that run from edge to edge\nof the space, in any dimension. We prove that the method leads to random but\non-average homogeneous and rotationally invariant fillings of circles, balls\nand arbitrary-dimensional hyperballs from which other shapes such as rectangles\nand cuboids can be cut. We briefly sketch the historic context of Bertrand's\nparadox and Jaynes' solution by the principle of maximum ignorance. We analyse\nthe statistical properties of the produced fillings, mapping out the density\nprofile and the line-length distribution and comparing them to analytic\nexpressions. We study the characteristic dimensions of the space in between the\nchords by determining the largest enclosed circles and balls in this pore\nspace, finding a lognormal distribution of the pore sizes. We apply the\nalgorithm to the direct-laser-writing fabrication design of optical\nmultiple-scattering samples as three-dimensional cubes of random but\nhomogeneously positioned and oriented chords.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 13:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 14:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 08:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

An intriguing phenomenon was observed that the quality factor for\nspecific modes of the resonator can be further improved by femtosecond laser\nirradiation. The high repetition laser pulses scatters into the cavity by\nforming a defect on the surface and is confined in the edge. A localized\ncoupled laser refining process will then repair the lattice disorders and tiny\nburrs on the periphery. The intrinsic quality factor of a measured mode can be\npromoted from 2.17$\\times$10$^5$ to 1.84$\\times$10$^6$ indicating one order of\nmagnitude improvement. This highly controllable method has its own unique\nadvantages in improving the quality of an integrated resonator which opens new\nprospects for single component engineering of LN photonic integrated circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 07:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}
