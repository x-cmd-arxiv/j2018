The key to our\napproach is a deep generative network which can hallucinate images of a scene\nas if they were taken at a different season (e.g. during winter), weather\ncondition (e.g. in a cloudy day) or time of the day (e.g. at sunset). Once the\nscene is hallucinated with the given attributes, the corresponding look is then\ntransferred to the input image while preserving the semantic details intact,\ngiving a photo-realistic manipulation result. As the proposed framework\nhallucinates what the scene will look like, it does not require any reference\nstyle image as commonly utilized in most of the appearance or style transfer\napproaches. Moreover, it allows to simultaneously manipulate a given scene\naccording to a diverse set of transient attributes within a single model,\neliminating the need of training multiple networks per each translation task.\nOur comprehensive set of qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach against the competing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 16:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 09:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 06:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

In this paper, we prove that in order to determine a pair of\ngeneric signals uniquely, up to trivial ambiguities, the number of phaseless\nmeasurements one needs to collect is, at most, five times the number of\nparameters required to describe the signals. This result improves significantly\nupon previous papers, which required the number of measurements to be quadratic\nin the number of parameters rather than linear.\n  In addition, we consider the simpler problem of recovering a pair of generic\nsignals from their blind short-time Fourier transform, when the phases are\nknown. In this setting, which can be understood as a special case of the blind\ndeconvolution problem, we show that the number of measurements required to\ndetermine the two signals, up to trivial ambiguities, equals exactly the number\nof parameters to be recovered.\n  As a side result, we study the classical phase retrieval problem---that is,\nrecovering a signal from its Fourier magnitudes---when some entries of the\nsignal are known apriori. We derive a bound on the number of required\nmeasurements as a function of the size of the set of known entries.\nSpecifically, we show that if most of the signal's entries are known, then only\na few Fourier magnitudes are necessary to determine a signal uniquely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 16:03:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 02:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

This study aims to examine the effect of\ndifferent geometrical layouts at the exit towards the pedestrian flow via\ncontrolled laboratory experiments with human participants. The experimental\nsetups involve pedestrian flow through 14 different geometrical configurations\nthat include different exit locations and obstacles near exit under normal and\nslow running conditions. It was found that corner exit performed better than\nmiddle exit under same obstacle condition. Further, it was observed that the\neffectiveness of obstacle is sensitive to its size and distance from the exit.\nThus, with careful architectural adjustment within a standard escape area, a\nsubstantial increase in outflow under normal and slow running conditions could\nbe achieved. However, it was also observed that placing the obstacle too close\nto the exit can reduce outflow under both normal and slow running conditions.\nMoreover, we could not observe \"faster-is-slower\" effect under slow running\ncondition and instead noticed \"faster-is-faster\" effect. In addition, the power\nlaw fitted headway distribution demonstrated that any architectural\nconfigurations that enhanced the outflow have higher exponent value compared to\nthe other configuration that negates the outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 17:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The failure of GRF-based methods is due to unrealistic assumptions about\nthe covariance function of the imaging data. The permutation procedure is the\nmost robust SEI tool because it estimates the covariance function from the\nimaging data.

The size-mass relation shows that these SMGs are\ngenerally similar to less-luminous star-forming galaxies selected by NUV-r vs.\nr-J colors. Because of the intrinsic luminosity of the sample, their rest-frame\noptical emission is less extended than the 850um sources (S850>2mJy), and more\nextended than the star-forming galaxies in the same redshift range. For the\nstellar mass and SFR matched sample at z~=1 and z~=2, the size differences are\nmarginal between faint SMGs and the matched galaxies. Moreover, faint SMGs have\nsimilar Sersic indices and projected axis ratios as star-forming galaxies with\nthe same stellar mass and SFR. Both SMGs and the matched galaxies show high\nfractions (~70%) of disturbed features at z~=2, and the fractions depend on the\nSFRs. These suggest that their star formation activity is related to galaxy\nmerging, and the stellar structures of SMGs are similar to those of\nstar-forming galaxies.

First, the relatively\nnarrow observed distribution of $E_{X}/E_{\\gamma}$ (the isotropic equivalent\nearly X-ray afterglow to prompt $\\gamma$-ray energy ratio) implies that at any\nangle that $\\gamma$-rays are emitted the Lorentz factor must be high.\nSpecifically, the Lorentz factor of $\\gamma$-ray emitting material cannot drop\nrapidly with angle, and must be $\\Gamma(\\theta)\\gtrsim 50$ even if there are\nangles for which the gamma-ray received energy is lower by three orders of\nmagnitude compared to the jet core. Second, jets with an angular structure of\nthe $\\gamma$-ray emission that over-produce events with a $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity below the peak of the observed luminosity function are ruled-out.\nThis eliminates models in which the $\\gamma$-ray energy angular distribution\nisn't sufficiently steep and the Lorentz factor distribution isn't sufficiently\nshallow. Finally, models with a steep structure (e.g. Gaussian) which are\ndetected away from the jet core generate afterglow light-curves that were never\nobserved. We conclude that even if the jet kinetic energy distribution drops\ncontinuously with latitude, efficient $\\gamma$-ray emission seems to be\nrestricted to material with $\\Gamma\\gtrsim 50$ and is most likely confined to a\nnarrow region around the core. While our study is confined to long GRBs, where\nthe observed sample is larger and more complete, there are indications that\nsimilar conclusions may be applicable also to short GRBs.

Our physical model of the non-linearly\nevolved density field, as probed by galaxy surveys, employs Lagrangian\nperturbation theory (LPT) to connect Gaussian initial conditions to the final\ndensity field, followed by a coordinate transformation to obtain the redshift\nspace representation for comparison with data. We generate realizations of\nprimordial and present-day matter fluctuations given a set of observations.\nThis hierarchical approach encodes a novel AP test, extracting several orders\nof magnitude more information from the cosmological expansion compared to\nclassical approaches, to infer cosmological parameters and jointly reconstruct\nthe underlying 3D dark matter density field. The novelty of this AP test lies\nin constraining the comoving-redshift transformation to infer the appropriate\ncosmology which yields isotropic correlations of the galaxy density field, with\nthe underlying assumption relying purely on the cosmological principle. Such an\nAP test does not rely explicitly on modelling the full statistics of the field.\nWe verify in depth via simulations that this renders our test robust to model\nmisspecification. This leads to another crucial advantage, namely that the\ncosmological parameters exhibit extremely weak dependence on the currently\nunresolved phenomenon of galaxy bias, thereby circumventing a potentially key\nlimitation. This is consequently among the first methods to extract a large\nfraction of information from statistics other than that of direct density\ncontrast correlations, without being sensitive to the amplitude of density\nfluctuations.

We divide multiple video frames into grids of patches and train\na network to solve jigsaw puzzles on these patches from multiple frames. So the\nnetwork is trained to correctly identify the position of a patch within a video\nframe as well as the position of a patch over time. We also propose a novel\npermutation strategy that outperforms random permutations while significantly\nreducing computational and memory constraints.

If some marginals are continuous but not normal, the\nsemiparametric copula-based principal component analysis (COCA) method is an\nalternative to PCA that combines a Gaussian copula with nonparametric\nmarginals.

The interpretation of the reconstructed energy in terms of\nthe real neutrino energy must rely on a model for the neutrino-nucleus\ninteraction. The Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) model is frequently used in these\nanalyses. In the Hartree-Fock (HF) model for quasielastic nucleon knockout, the\nbound nucleon wave functions are obtained using an effective nucleon-nucleon\nforce. The final-state wave function is constructed from continuum states in\nthe same potential which have the correct asymptotic behavior. The Continuum\nRandom Phase Approximation (CRPA) model extends the HF approach taking long\nrange correlations into account in a self-consistent way. Considering only\nsingle-nucleon processes, the distributions of reconstructed neutrino energies\nobtained within the HF-CRPA approach are compared with the results of the RFG,\nan RPWIA calculation, and the RPA+np-nh model of Martini et al.\n  We find that the distributions of reconstructed energies for a fixed incoming\nenergy in the HF-CRPA display additional strength in the low reconstructed\nenergy tails compared to models without elastic distortion of the outgoing\nnucleon. This asymmetry redistributes strength from higher to lower values of\nthe reconstructed energy.

Deep learning-based methods have\ndemonstrated promise for both supervised and unsupervised depth estimation from\nmonocular images. Most existing approaches treat depth estimation as a\nregression problem with a local pixel-wise loss function. In this work, we\ninnovate beyond existing approaches by using adversarial training to learn a\ncontext-aware, non-local loss function. Such an approach penalizes the joint\nconfiguration of predicted depth values at the patch-level instead of the\npixel-level, which allows networks to incorporate more global information. In\nthis framework, the generator learns a mapping between RGB images and its\ncorresponding depth map, while the discriminator learns to distinguish depth\nmap and RGB pairs from ground truth. This conditional GAN depth estimation\nframework is stabilized using spectral normalization to prevent mode collapse\nwhen learning from diverse datasets. We test this approach using a diverse set\nof generators that include U-Net and joint CNN-CRF. We benchmark this approach\non the NYUv2, Make3D and KITTI datasets, and observe that adversarial training\nreduces relative error by several fold, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 19:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 06:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 18:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

Previous work mainly focused\non direct manipulation on natural image manifold through color strokes,\nkey-points, textures, and holes-to-fill. In this work, we present a novel\nhierarchical framework for semantic image manipulation. Key to our hierarchical\nframework is that we employ a structured semantic layout as our intermediate\nrepresentation for manipulation. Initialized with coarse-level bounding boxes,\nour structure generator first creates pixel-wise semantic layout capturing the\nobject shape, object-object interactions, and object-scene relations. Then our\nimage generator fills in the pixel-level textures guided by the semantic\nlayout. Such framework allows a user to manipulate images at object-level by\nadding, removing, and moving one bounding box at a time. Experimental\nevaluations demonstrate the advantages of the hierarchical manipulation\nframework over existing image generation and context hole-filing models, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively. Benefits of the hierarchical framework are\nfurther demonstrated in applications such as semantic object manipulation,\ninteractive image editing, and data-driven image manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 19:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 00:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The BLTP theory hypothesizes the existence of an\nelectromagnetic length scale of nature --- the Bopp length $\\varkappa ^{-1}$\n---, to the effect that the electrostatic pair interaction deviates\nsignificantly from Coulomb's law only for distances much shorter than\n$\\varkappa^{-1}$. Rigorous lower and upper bounds are constructed for the\nSchr\\\"odinger energy levels of the hydrogen atom, $E_{\\ell,n}(\\varkappa)$, for\nall $\\ell\\in\\{0,1,2,...\\}$ and $n >\\ell$. The energy levels\n$E_{0,1}(\\varkappa)$, $E_{0,2}(\\varkappa)$, and $E_{1,2}(\\varkappa)$ are also\ncomputed numerically and plotted versus $\\varkappa^{-1}$. It is found that the\nBLTP theory predicts a non-relativistic correction to the splitting of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ line in addition to its well-known relativistic fine-structure\nsplitting. Under the assumption, that this splitting doesn't go away in a\nrelativistic calculation, it is argued that present-day precision measurements\nof the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line suggest that $\\varkappa^{-1}$ must be smaller than\n$\\approx 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Finite proton size effects are found not to\nmodify this conclusion. As a consequence, the electrostatic field energy of an\nelementary point charge, although finite in BLTP electrodynamics, is much\nlarger than the empirical rest energy of an electron. If, as assumed in all\n`renormalized theories' of the electron, the empirical rest mass of a physical\nelectron is the sum of its bare rest mass plus its electrostatic field energy\n($/c^2$), then in BLTP electrodynamics the electron has to be assigned a\nnegative bare rest mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 20:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 13:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

Our method builds on the generalized Bloch theorem [A. Alase et al.,\nPhys. Rev. B 96, 195133 (2017)] and the fact that the bulk-boundary separation\nof the Schrodinger equation is compatible with a partial Fourier transform\noperation. Bulk equations may display unusual features because they are\nrelative eigenvalue problems for non-Hermitian, bulk-projected Hamiltonians.\nNonetheless, they admit a rich symmetry analysis that can simplify considerably\nthe structure of energy eigenstates, often allowing a solution in fully\nanalytical form. We illustrate our extension of the generalized Bloch theorem\nto multicomponent systems by determining the exact Andreev bound states for a\nsimple SNS junction. We then analyze the Creutz ladder model, by way of a\nconceptual bridge from one to higher dimensions. Upon introducing a new\nGaussian duality transformation that maps the Creutz ladder to a system of two\nMajorana chains, we show how the model provides a first example of a\nshort-range chiral topological insulator hosting topological zero modes with a\npower-law profile. Additional applications include the complete analytical\ndiagonalization of graphene ribbons with both zigzag-bearded and armchair\nboundary conditions, and the analytical determination of the edge modes in a\nchiral $p+ip$ two-dimensional topological superconductor. Lastly, we revisit\nthe phenomenon of Majorana flat bands and anomalous bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence in a two-band gapless $s$-wave topological superconductor.

In the state-of-the-art method, accurate object proposal\nalgorithms are first leveraged for generating a set of local regions containing\nparticular landmarks with high confidence. Then, these candidate regions are\nrepresented by deep features and pairwise matching is performed in an\nexhaustive manner for the similarity measure. Despite its success, conventional\nobject proposal methods usually produce massive landmark-dependent image\npatches exhibiting significant distribution variance in scale and overlap. As a\nresult, the inconsistency in landmark distributions tends to produce biased\nsimilarity between pairwise images yielding the suboptimal performance. In\norder to gain an insight into the landmark-based place recognition scheme, we\nconduct a comprehensive study in which the influence of landmark scales and the\nproportion of overlap on the recognition performance is explored. More\nspecifically, we thoroughly study the exhaustive search based landmark matching\nmechanism, and thus derive three-fold important observations in terms of the\nbeneficial effect of specific landmark generation strategies. Inspired by the\nabove observations, a simple yet effective dense sampling based scheme is\npresented for accurate place recognition in this paper.

Recently, GANs have been\nextended from generating images to generating sequences (e.g., poems, music and\ncodes). Existing GANs on sequence generation mainly focus on general sequences,\nwhich are grammar-free. In many real-world applications, however, we need to\ngenerate sequences in a formal language with the constraint of its\ncorresponding grammar. For example, to test the performance of a database, one\nmay want to generate a collection of SQL queries, which are not only similar to\nthe queries of real users, but also follow the SQL syntax of the target\ndatabase. Generating such sequences is highly challenging because both the\ngenerator and discriminator of GANs need to consider the structure of the\nsequences and the given grammar in the formal language. To address these\nissues, we study the problem of syntax-aware sequence generation with GANs, in\nwhich a collection of real sequences and a set of pre-defined grammatical rules\nare given to both discriminator and generator. We propose a novel GAN\nframework, namely TreeGAN, to incorporate a given Context-Free Grammar (CFG)\ninto the sequence generation process. In TreeGAN, the generator employs a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) to construct a parse tree. Each generated parse\ntree can then be translated to a valid sequence of the given grammar. The\ndiscriminator uses a tree-structured RNN to distinguish the generated trees\nfrom real trees.

To do so, IB identifies an intermediate \"bottleneck\" variable $T$ that has\nlow mutual information $I(X;T)$ and high mutual information $I(Y;T)$. The \"IB\ncurve\" characterizes the set of bottleneck variables that achieve maximal\n$I(Y;T)$ for a given $I(X;T)$, and is typically explored by maximizing the \"IB\nLagrangian\", $I(Y;T) - \\beta I(X;T)$. In some cases, $Y$ is a deterministic\nfunction of $X$, including many classification problems in supervised learning\nwhere the output class $Y$ is a deterministic function of the input $X$. We\ndemonstrate three caveats when using IB in any situation where $Y$ is a\ndeterministic function of $X$: (1) the IB curve cannot be recovered by\nmaximizing the IB Lagrangian for different values of $\\beta$; (2) there are\n\"uninteresting\" trivial solutions at all points of the IB curve; and (3) for\nmulti-layer classifiers that achieve low prediction error, different layers\ncannot exhibit a strict trade-off between compression and prediction, contrary\nto a recent proposal. We also show that when $Y$ is a small perturbation away\nfrom being a deterministic function of $X$, these three caveats arise in an\napproximate way.

Because CRs with these\nenergies are deflected by interstellar magnetic fields identification of\nindividual sources and determination of their spectral characteristics is more\nlikely via very high energy $\\gamma$-ray emissions, which provide the necessary\ndirectional information. However, pair production on the interstellar radiation\nfield (ISRF) and cosmic microwave background leads to steepening of the\nhigh-energy tails of $\\gamma$-ray spectra, and should be corrected for to\nenable true properties of the spectrum at source to be recovered.

We show herein that the electron mobility of LBSO films can be improved\nwithout inserting any buffer layers if the films are grown under highly\noxidative ozone (O3) atmospheres. The O3 environments relaxed the LBSO lattice\nand reduced the formation of Sn2+ states, which are known to suppress the\nelectron mobility in LBSO. The resultant O3-LBSO films showed improved mobility\nvalues up to 115 cm2 V-1 s-1, which is among the highest in LBSO films on\nSrTiO3 substrates and comparable to LBSO films with buffer layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 03:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

In this work, a sample of\ncontained neutrino interactions in IceCube is obtained from 5 years of data and\nclassified as 2650 tracks and 965 cascades. Tracks arise predominantly from\ncharged-current $\\nu_{\\mu}$ interactions, and we demonstrate that we can\nreconstruct their energy and inelasticity. The inelasticity distribution is\nfound to be consistent with the calculation of Cooper-Sarkar et al. across the\nenergy range from $\\sim$ 1 TeV to $\\sim$ 100 TeV. Along with cascades from\nneutrinos of all flavors, we also perform a fit over the energy, zenith angle,\nand inelasticity distribution to characterize the flux of astrophysical and\natmospheric neutrinos. The energy spectrum of diffuse astrophysical neutrinos\nis well-described by a power-law in both track and cascade samples, and a\nbest-fit index $\\gamma=2.62\\pm0.07$ is found in the energy range from 3.5 TeV\nto 2.6 PeV.

Their locomotion, however, is subject to\nstringent constraints due to the dominance of viscous over inertial forces at\nlow Reynolds number (Re) in the microscopic world. Furthermore, locomotory\ngaits designed for one medium may become ineffective in a different medium.\nSuccessful biomedical applications of synthetic microswimmers rely on their\nability to traverse biological environments with vastly different properties.\nHere we leverage the prowess of machine learning to present an alternative\napproach to designing low Re swimmers. Instead of specifying any locomotory\ngaits \\textit{a priori}, here a swimmer develops its own propulsion strategy\nbased on its interactions with the surrounding medium via reinforcement\nlearning. This self-learning capability enables the swimmer to modify its\npropulsion strategy in response to different environments. We illustrate this\nnew approach using a minimal example that integrates a standard reinforcement\nlearning algorithm ($Q$-learning) into the locomotion of a swimmer consisting\nof an assembly of spheres connected by extensible rods. We showcase\ntheoretically that this first self-learning swimmer can recover a previously\nknown propulsion strategy without prior knowledge in low Re locomotion,\nidentify more effective locomotory gaits when the number of spheres increases,\nand adapt its locomotory gaits in different media.

To this end, a wavelet approach developed for\nimage texture analysis is applied to an ensemble of high-resolution\nquantitative precipitation forecasts. The forecasts are verified against\nestimates from a high-resolution regional reanalysis with a similar model\nversion. The wavelet approach estimates an averaged wavelet spectrum for each\nspatial field of the ensemble forecasts and the reanalysis, thereby removing\nall information on the localization of precipitation and investigating solely\nthe overall structure of forecasts and reanalysis. In order to assess skill\nusing a multivariate score, an additional reduction of dimensionality is\nneeded. This is performed using singular vectors from a linear discriminant\nanalysis as it favors data compression in the direction where the ensemble is\nmost discriminating. We discuss implications of this strategy, show that the\naveraged wavelet spectra give valuable information on forecast performance. The\nskill difference between a so-called perfect forecast using for verification a\nmember of the ensemble, and the non-perfect forecast using the reanalysis\npoints to significant deficiencies of the forecast ensemble. Overall, the\ndiscriminating power solely based on global spectral information is remarkable,\nand the COSMO-DE-EPS is a quite good forecast ensemble with respect to the\nreanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 08:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-24"}

In this system, we have one secondary base-station\n(S-BS) that supports multiple secondary information decoding (S-ID) and\nsecondary EH (S-EH) users simultaneously under the condition that interference\npower that affects the primary ID (P-ID) receivers should stay below a certain\nthreshold. The goal of the paper is to develop a generalized precoder design\nthat maximizes the sum-utility cost function under the transmit power\nconstraint at the S-BS, and the EH constraint at each S-EH user, and the\ninterference power constraint at each P-ID user. Therefore, the previous\nstudies for the CR and SWIPT systems are casted as particular solutions of the\nproposed framework. The problem is inherently non-convex and even the weighted\nminimum mean squared error (WMMSE) transformation does not resolve the\nnon-convexity of the original problem. To tackle the problem, we find a\nsolution from the dual optimization via sub-gradient ellipsoid method based on\nthe observation that the WMMSE transformation raises zero-duality gap between\nthe primal and the dual problems. We also propose a simplified algorithm for\nthe case of a single S-ID user, which is shown to achieve the global optimum.\nFinally, we demonstrate the optimality and efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithms through numerical simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 10:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Most\nstrikingly, the extent to which the system recollects memory is largest for\ntraining amplitudes near the yield strain and is a direct consequence of the\nspatial extent over which the system reorganizes during the encoding process.\nOur study further suggests that the evolution of force networks on training\nplays a decisive role in memory formation in jammed packings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 11:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

A visual path is\nextracted from the video by extracting some keyframes from the video. The robot\nuses this visual path for its navigation. Funnel lane unlike some other methods\ndoes not make use of traditional calculations of Jacobians, homographies,\nfundamental matrices, or the focus of expansion, and does not require any\ncamera calibration. However, funnel lane has some shortcomings. One problem is\nthat funnel lane gives no information about the radius of rotation, so in\nturnings, the robot turns by a constant radius of rotation along the path. This\nreduces the maneuverability and limits the robot from dealing with all turnings\nconditions. In addition, this problem makes the robot faces a serious problem\nin correcting its path when it deviates from the desired path. Another flaw is\nthat in some situations the robot faces an ambiguity to understand whether a\ntranslation or a rotation should be followed in the visual path which leads the\nrobot to deviate and to fail in following the desired path. This paper\nintroduces the sloped funnel lane technique which does not have these\nshortcomings. The roll and pitch angles are added to the funnel lane, which\nhelp the robot to set its radius of rotation according to the turnings\nconditions it faces. Moreover, they help to reduce the ambiguity between\ntranslation and rotation. Therefore the robot can deal with different turnings\nconditions and the navigation method will be more robust and accurate.\nExperimental results on challenging scenarios on a real ground robot\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of sloped funnel lane technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 11:53:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 10:40:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 22:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

However,\nthis is not so, and here I review the evidence for this claim, and outline the\nrequirements for a solution. The goal of alignment is often stated to be to\njuxtapose nucleotides (or their derivatives, such as amino acids) that have\nbeen inherited from a common ancestral nucleotide (although other goals are\nalso possible). Unfortunately, this is not an operational definition, because\nhomology (in this sense) refers to unique and unobservable historical events,\nand so there can be no objective mathematical function to optimize.\nConsequently, almost all algorithms developed for multiple sequence alignment\nare based on optimizing some sort of compositional similarity (similarity =\nhomology + analogy). As a result, many, if not most, practitioners either\nmanually modify computer-produced alignments or they perform de novo manual\nalignment, especially in the field of phylogenetics. So, if homology is the\ngoal, then multiple sequence alignment is not yet a solved computational\nproblem. Several criteria have been developed by biologists to help them\nidentify potential homologies (compositional, ontogenetic, topographical and\nfunctional similarity, plus conjunction and congruence), and these criteria can\nbe applied to molecular data, in principle. Current computer programs do\nimplement one (or occasionally two) of these criteria, but no program\nimplements them all. What is needed is a program that evaluates all of the\nevidence for the sequence homologies, optimizes their combination, and thus\nproduces the best hypotheses of homology.

Several software packages are now also\navailable for their implementation. Although mathematically straightforward,\nthe inclusion of multiple longitudinal outcomes in the joint model remains\ncomputationally difficult due to the large number of random effects required,\nwhich hampers the practical application of this extension. We present a novel\napproach that enables the fitting of such models with more realistic\ncomputational times. The idea behind the approach is to split the estimation of\nthe joint model in two steps; estimating a multivariate mixed model for the\nlongitudinal outcomes, and then using the output from this model to fit the\nsurvival submodel. So called two-stage approaches have previously been\nproposed, and shown to be biased. Our approach differs from the standard\nversion, in that we additionally propose the application of a correction\nfactor, adjusting the estimates obtained such that they more closely resemble\nthose we would expect to find with the multivariate joint model. This\ncorrection is based on importance sampling ideas. Simulation studies show that\nthis corrected-two-stage approach works satisfactorily, eliminating the bias\nwhile maintaining substantial improvement in computational time, even in more\ndifficult settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 12:41:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 13:19:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 10:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

The cluster model constructed by the SSHT approach reasonably\nreflects the electronic structures of the Ga$_2$O$_3$ surface. The geometry of\nCO$_2$ adsorbed on the Ag-loaded Ga$_2$O$_3$ cluster has a bent structure,\nwhich is favorable for its photocatalytic reduction to CO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 13:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

The\nnovelty is in the choice of the penalty functions, which are smooth and can\ninduce a non-zero penalty over some points in feasible region of the original\nconstrained problem. The resulting unconstrained penalized problem is\nparametrized by two penalty parameters which control the slope and the\ncurvature of the penalty function. With a suitable selection of these penalty\nparameters, we show that the solutions of the resulting penalized unconstrained\nproblem are \\emph{feasible} for the original constrained problem, under some\nassumptions. Also, we establish that, with suitable choices of penalty\nparameters, the solutions of the penalized unconstrained problem can achieve a\nsuboptimal value which is arbitrarily close to the optimal value of the\noriginal constrained problem. For the problems with a large number of linear\ninequality constraints, a particular advantage of such a smooth penalty-based\nreformulation is that it renders a penalized problem suitable for the\nimplementation of fast incremental gradient methods, which require only one\nsample from the inequality constraints at each iteration. We consider applying\nSAGA proposed in \\cite{saga} to solve the resulting penalized unconstrained\nproblem. Moreover, we propose an alternative approach to set up the penalized\nproblem.

On the other hand, the amplitude of\noscillation is suppressed by the surface disorder while it has no influence on\nthe phase of oscillation. Furthermore, with the help of the vertical bias, a\nspecial (1,-2) 3D TI PN junction can be achieved, leading to a novel spin\nprecession phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 14:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-27"}

Our proposed method uses a two- pass approach: Previously\nrecovered manifold connectivity is used for ordering noisy samples along this\nmanifold and express these as residuals in order to enable parametric\ndenoising. This separates recovering low-frequency features from denoising high\nfrequencies, which avoids over-smoothing. The noise probability density\nfunctions (PDFs) at samples are either taken from sensor noise models or from\nestimates of the connectivity recovered in the first pass. The output curve\nbalances the signed distances (inside/outside) to the samples. Additionally,\nthe angles between edges of the polygon representing the connectivity become\nminimized in the least-square sense. The movement of the polygon's vertices is\nrestricted to their noise extent, i.e., a cut-off distance corresponding to a\nmaximum variance of the PDFs. We approximate the resulting optimization model,\nwhich consists of higher-order functions, by a linear model with good\ncorrespondence. Our algorithm is parameter-free and operates fast on the local\nneighborhoods determined by the connectivity. We augment a least-squares solver\nconstrained by a linear system to also handle bounds. This enables us to\nguarantee stochastic error bounds for sampled curves corrupted by noise, e.g.,\nsilhouettes from sensed data, and we improve on the reconstruction error from\nground truth.

This is due to their abundance as well as their small radii and low\nmasses and temperatures, which facilitate the detection of temperate, rocky\nplanets in orbit around them. However, the fundamental properties of M dwarfs\nare difficult to constrain, often limiting our ability to characterise the\nplanets they host. Here we test several theoretical relationships for M dwarfs\nby measuring 23 high precision, model-independent masses and radii for M dwarfs\nin binaries with white dwarfs. We find a large scatter in the radii of these\nlow-mass stars, with 25 per cent having radii consistent with theoretical\nmodels while the rest are up to 12 per cent over-inflated. This scatter is seen\nin both partially- and fully-convective M dwarfs. No clear trend is seen\nbetween the over-inflation and age or metallicity, but there are indications\nthat the radii of slowly rotating M dwarfs are more consistent with\npredictions, albeit with a similar amount of scatter in the measurements\ncompared to more rapidly rotating M dwarfs. The sample of M dwarfs in close\nbinaries with white dwarfs appears indistinguishable from other M dwarf\nsamples, implying that common envelope evolution has a negligible impact on\ntheir structure.

While recent image-text\nretrieval methods offer great promise by learning deep representations aligned\nacross modalities, most of these methods are plagued by the issue of training\nwith small-scale datasets covering a limited number of images with ground-truth\nsentences. Moreover, it is extremely expensive to create a larger dataset by\nannotating millions of images with sentences and may lead to a biased model.\nInspired by the recent success of webly supervised learning in deep neural\nnetworks, we capitalize on readily-available web images with noisy annotations\nto learn robust image-text joint representation. Specifically, our main idea is\nto leverage web images and corresponding tags, along with fully annotated\ndatasets, in training for learning the visual-semantic joint embedding. We\npropose a two-stage approach for the task that can augment a typical supervised\npair-wise ranking loss based formulation with weakly-annotated web images to\nlearn a more robust visual-semantic embedding.

We compare this\nexpression with the empirical relationship between the slope of the millimetre\ncontinuum spectrum and the plasma optical thickness computed from both\nisothermal and multi-thermal two-dimensional cylindrical radiative transfer\nmodels.\n  Results. It is found that the logarithmic-scale spectral gradient provides a\nclear diagnostic for the optical thickness regime for both isothermal and\nmulti-thermal plasmas, provided that a suitable correction is made for a\nnon-constant gaunt factor over the frequency band.

In yesteryears, an amplification of dengue infections in India posed\nthe need for introspection of existing dengue control policies. Prior\nunderstanding of the impacts of control interventions is necessary for their\nfuture implementation. In this paper, we propose and analyze a compartmental\nmodel of dengue to assess the impact of active case finding (ACF) on dengue\ndisease transmission. Currently, primary prevention of dengue is possible only\nwith vector control and personal protection from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes. Although a few experimental studies are performed to assess ACF in\ndengue disease, but this is the first attempt to represent and study the\ndynamics of disease using ACF as a control strategy. Local and global dynamics\nof the system are studied. We use sensitivity analysis to see the effects of\ncontrollable parameters of the model on the basic reproduction number and total\nnumber of infective population. We find that decrease in the biting rate of\nmosquitoes, and increase in the rate of hospitalization and/or notification,\ndeath rate of mosquitoes and ACF for asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals\nplay crucial role for the reduction of disease prevalence.

For this\nreason, the recently proposed stochastic DFT (sDFT), avoiding exhaustive DM\nevaluations, is emerging as an attractive alternative linear-scaling approach.\nThis review develops a general formulation of sDFT in terms of a\n(non)orthogonal basis representation and offers an analysis of the statistical\nerrors (SEs) involved in the calculation. Using a new Gaussian-type basis-set\nimplementation of sDFT, applied to water clusters and silicon nanocrystals, it\ndemonstrates and explains how the standard deviation and the bias depend on the\nsampling rate and the system size in various types of calculations. We also\ndevelop basis-set embedded-fragments theory, demonstrating its utility for\nreducing the SEs for energy, density of states and nuclear force calculations.\nFinally, we discuss the algorithmic complexity of sDFT, showing it has CPU\nwall-time linear-scaling. The method parallelizes well over distributed\nprocessors with good scalability and therefore may find use in the upcoming\nexascale computing architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 08:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 14:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

The fluctuating\noperation of low-temperature P2G loads can be achieved by controlling the\nelectrolysis current alone. However, this method does not apply to\nhigh-temperature P2G (HT-P2G) technology with auxiliary parameters such as\ntemperature and feed rates: Such parameters need simultaneous coordination with\ncurrent due to their great impact on conversion efficiency. To improve the\nsystem performance of HT-P2G while tracking the dynamic power input, this paper\nproposes a maximum production point tracking (MPPT) strategy and coordinates\nthe current, temperature and feed rates together. In addition, a comprehensive\ndynamic model of an HT-P2G plant is established to test the performance of the\nproposed MPPT strategy, which is absent in previous studies that focused on\nsteady states. The case study suggests that the MPPT operation responds to the\nexternal load command rapidly even though the internal transition and\nstabilization cost a few minutes. Moreover, the conversion efficiency and\navailable loading capacity are both improved, which is definitely beneficial in\nthe long run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 08:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}
