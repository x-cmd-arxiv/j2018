In addition, Real NVP\nefficiently computes the determinant of the Jacobian of the warp, which is\nrequired to implement the change of integration variables implied by the warp.\nA main advantage of our approach is that it is agnostic of underlying light\ntransport effects, and can be combined with many existing rendering techniques\nby treating them as a black box. We show that our approach leads to effective\nvariance reduction in several practical scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 16:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-24"}

For seven ensemble\nsizes (50, 70, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000) and seven EnKF-variants (Damped,\nIterative, Local, Hybrid, Dual, Normal Score and Classical EnKF), we computed\n1000 synthetic parameter estimation experiments for two set-ups: a 2D tracer\ntransport problem and a 2D flow problem with one injection well.

Recently, EPR steerable states are\nshown to be fundamental resources for one-sided device-independent quantum\ninformation processing tasks and, hence, identification of EPR steerable states\nbecomes important from foundational as well as informational theoretic\nperspectives.

In most studies,\nan annual outcome variable is observed, e.g. agricultural yield, along with a\nhigher-frequency regressor, e.g. daily temperature. Applied researchers then\nface a problem of selecting a model to characterize the nonlinear relationship\nbetween the outcome and the high-frequency regressor to make a policy\nrecommendation based on the model-implied damage function. We show that\nexisting model selection criteria are only suitable for the policy objective if\none of the models under consideration nests the true model. If all models are\nseen as imperfect approximations to the true nonlinear relationship, the model\nthat performs well in the normal climate conditions is not guaranteed to\nperform well at the projected climate that is different from the historical\nnorm. We therefore propose a new criterion, the proximity-weighted mean-squared\nerror (PWMSE), that directly targets precision of the damage function at the\nprojected future climate. To make this criterion feasible, we assign higher\nweights to prior years that can serve as weather analogs to the projected\nfuture climate when evaluating competing models using the PWMSE. We show that\nour approach selects the best approximate regression model that has the\nsmallest weighted error of predicted impacts for a projected future climate.

Determining their\norigin is of fundamental importance to constrain the shape and mass of the dark\nhalo. The leading scenario for the ejection of HVSs is an encounter with the\nsupermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre. However, new proper motions\nfrom the \\textit{Gaia} mission indicate that only the fastest HVSs can be\ntraced back to the Galactic centre and the remaining stars originate in the\ndisc or halo. In this paper, we study HVSs generated by encounters of stellar\nbinaries with an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a star\ncluster. For the first time, we model the effect of the cluster orbit in the\nGalactic potential on the observable properties of the ejected population. HVSs\ngenerated by this mechanism do not travel on radial orbits consistent with a\nGalactic centre origin, but rather point back to their parent cluster, thus\nproviding observational evidence for the presence of an IMBH. We also model the\nejection of high-velocity stars from the Galactic population of globular\nclusters, assuming that they all contain an IMBH, including the effects of the\ncluster's orbit and propagation of the star in the Galactic potential up to\ndetection. We find that high-velocity stars ejected by IMBHs have distinctive\ndistributions in velocity, Galactocentric distance and Galactic latitude, which\ncan be used to distinguish them from runaway stars and stars ejected from the\nGalactic Centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 00:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Recently a significant\nsample of O stars within our Galaxy was spectroscopically identified and\npresented in the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSS). At the same time,\na large high-fidelity catalog of X-ray sources detected by the XMM-Newton X-ray\ntelescope was released.

We find that, among the\nGOSS sample, 127 O-stars have a unique XMM-Newton source counterpart and a Gaia\ndata release 2 (DR2) association. Terminal velocities are known for a subsample\nof 35 of these stars. We confirm that the X-ray luminosities of dwarf and giant\nO stars correlate with their bolometric luminosity. For the subsample of O\nstars with measure terminal velocities we find that the X-ray luminosities of\ndwarf and giant O stars also correlate with wind parameters. However, we find\nthat these correlations break down for supergiant stars. Moreover, we show that\nsupergiant stars are systematically harder in X-rays compared to giant and\ndwarf O-type stars. We find that the X-ray luminosity depends on spectral type,\nbut seems to be independent of whether the stars are single or in a binary\nsystem. Finally, we show that the distribution of log(Lx/Lbol) in our sample\nstars is non-Gaussian, with the peak of the distribution at log(Lx/Lbol) around\n-6.6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Encouragingly, we previously found a\npromising source of luminosity since the black hole and the highly-magnetized\nneutron star establish an electronic circuit -- a black hole battery. In this\npaper, arguing against common lore, we consider the electric charge of the\nblack hole as an overlooked source of electromagnetic radiation. Relying on the\nwell known Wald mechanism by which a spinning black hole immersed in an\nexternal magnetic field acquires a stable net charge, we show that a\nstrongly-magnetized neutron star in such a binary system will give rise to a\nlarge enough charge in the black hole to allow for potentially observable\neffects.

Here, we implement empirically derived inter-correlated\ndistributions of initial binary parameters primary mass (M1), mass ratio (q),\norbital period (P), and eccentricity (e). Unexpectedly, the introduction of\ninter-correlated initial binary parameters leads to only a small decrease in\nthe predicted merger rates by a factor of 2 $-$ 3 relative to the previously\nused non-correlated initial distributions. The formation of compact object\nmergers in the isolated classical binary evolution favors initial binaries with\nstars of comparable masses (q = 0.5 $-$ 1) at intermediate orbital periods (log\nP (days) = 2 $-$ 4). New distributions slightly shift the mass ratios towards\nsmaller values with respect to the previously used flat q distribution, which\nis the dominant effect decreasing the rates.

To circumvent\nthis impediment a plethora of enhanced sampling methods has been developed. One\nimportant class of such methods relies on the application of a bias that is\nfunction of a set of collective variables specially designed for the problem\nunder consideration. The design of good collective variables can be challenging\nand thereby constitutes the main bottle neck in the application of these\nmethods. To address this problem, recently we have introduced Harmonic Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis, a method to systematically construct collective\nvariables. The method uses as input information on the metastable states\nvisited during the process that is being considered, information that can be\ngathered in short unbiased MD simulations, to construct the collective\nvariables as linear combinations of a set of descriptors. Here, to scale up our\nexamination of the method's efficiency, we applied it to the folding of\nChignolin in water. Interestingly, already before any biased simulations were\nrun, the constructed one dimensional collective variable revealed much of the\nphysics that underlies the folding process. In addition, using it in\nMetadynamics we were able to run simulations in which the system goes from the\nfolded state to the unfolded one and back, where to get fully converged results\nwe combined Metadynamics with Parallel Tempering. Finally, we examined how the\ncollective variable performs when different sets of descriptors are used in its\nconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

An\nenergy-efficient control policy determines the switch between work and sleep\nstates of servers in Group 2 in a dynamic way. Since servers in Group 1 are\nalways working with high priority to jobs, a transfer rule is proposed to\nmigrate the jobs in Group 2 to idle servers in Group 1. To find the optimal\nenergy-efficient policy, we set up a policy-based Poisson equation, and provide\nexplicit expressions for its unique solution of performance potentials by means\nof the RG-factorization.

Due to the motions of binary and the\ncompanion stars around the common mass center of the ternary system, the\nlight-time effect produces an irregularity on the eclipse timings. Monitoring\nthe variations in these timings, sub-stellar or planet companions orbiting\naround the binary system can be identified. In this paper, additional bodies\norbiting the Algol type binary DI Peg are examined by using the archival\neclipse timings including our CCD data observed at the Ankara University\nKreiken Observatory. More than five hundred minimum times equivalent to around\nnine decades are employed to identify the orbital behavior of the binary\nsystem. The best fit to the timings shows that the orbital period of DI Peg has\nvariation due to an integration of two sinusoids with the periods of $P_3 =\n49.50\\pm0.36$ yr and $P_4 = 27.40\\pm0.24$ yr.

Also, the residuals of two sinusoidal fits still\nseem to show another modulation with the period of roughly $P = 19.5$ yr.

Autonomous robots increasingly\ndepend on third party off-the-shelf components and complex machine-learning\ntechniques. This trend makes it challenging to provide strong design-time\ncertification of correct operation.\n  To address these challenges, we present SOTER, a robotics programming\nframework with two key components: (1) a programming language for implementing\nand testing high-level reactive robotics software and (2) an integrated runtime\nassurance (RTA) system that helps enable the use of uncertified components,\nwhile still providing safety guarantees. SOTER provides language primitives to\ndeclaratively construct a RTA module consisting of an advanced,\nhigh-performance controller (uncertified), a safe, lower-performance controller\n(certified), and the desired safety specification. The framework provides a\nformal guarantee that a well-formed RTA module always satisfies the safety\nspecification, without completely sacrificing performance by using higher\nperformance uncertified components whenever safe. SOTER allows the complex\nrobotics software stack to be constructed as a composition of RTA modules,\nwhere each uncertified component is protected using a RTA module.\n  To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we consider a real-world\ncase-study of building a safe drone surveillance system.

Stute, et al., Nat., 485, 482, (2012)),\nwhilst neutral atoms are versatile quantum systems, useful as memories (L.M.\nDuan, et al., Nat., 414, 413 (2001), B. Jing, et al., arXiv:1801.01193, H. P.\nSpecht, Nat., 473, 190 (2011)), for photon storage (O. Katz, et al., Nat.\nComm., 9, 2074 (2018)) or tunable photon delay via slow light (R. M. Camacho et\nal., PRA, 73, 063812, (2006), Camacho et al., PRL, 98, 153601, (2007)).\nDevelopment of these two quantum technologies has largely proceeded in separate\ntracks, partly due to their disparate wavelengths of operation, but combining\nthese platforms offers a compelling hybrid quantum system for use in quantum\nnetworking and distributed quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate the first\ninteraction of photons emitted from a trapped ion, with neutral atoms by\nimplementing slow light in a warm atomic vapour. We use two hyperfine\nabsorption resonances in a warm $^{87}$Rb vapour to provide a slow light medium\nin which a single photon from a trapped Ba$^+$ ion is delayed by up to\n13.5$\\pm$0.5 ns. The delay is tunable and preserves the temporal properties of\nthe photons. This result showcases a hybrid interface, useful for linking\ndifferent quantum systems together, or as a synchronisation tool for the\narrival times of photons - an essential tool for future quantum networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 20:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Unlike\nthe approximate factor models, we assume that the factors capture all the\nnon-trivial dynamics of the data, but the cross-sectional dependence may be\nexplained by both the factors and the idiosyncratic components. Under the\nproposed model, (a) the factor process is dynamically dependent and the\nidiosyncratic component is a white noise process, and (b) the largest\neigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the idiosyncratic components may\ndiverge to infinity as the dimension $p$ increases. We propose a white noise\ntesting procedure for high-dimensional time series to determine the number of\nwhite noise components and, hence, the number of common factors, and introduce\na projected Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to eliminate the diverging\neffect of the idiosyncratic noises.

The system is thoroughly evaluated on\nthe KITTI tracking dataset, and we show the performance boost provided by our\nCNN-based vehicle detector over a standard geometric approach.

The\nmethod used in this study is implementation in Couette flow of a statistical\nstate dynamics (SSD) closure at second order in a cumulant expansion of the\nNavier-Stokes equations in which the averaging operator is the streamwise mean.\nThe perturbations are the deviations from the streamwise mean and two\nmechanisms potentially contributing to maintaining these perturbations are\nidentified. These are parametric perturbation growth arising from interaction\nof the perturbations with the fluctuating mean flow and transient growth of\nperturbations arising from nonlinear interaction between components of the\nperturbation field. By the method of comparing the turbulence maintained in the\nSSD and in the associated direct numerical simulation (DNS) in which these\nmechanisms have been selectively included and excluded, parametric growth is\nfound to maintain the perturbation field of the turbulence while the more\ncommonly invoked mechanism of transient growth of perturbations arising from\nscattering by nonlinear interaction is found to suppress perturbation growth.\nIn addition to verifying that the parametric mechanism maintains the\nperturbations in DNS it is also verified that the Lyapunov vectors are the\nstructures that dominate the perturbation energy and energetics in DNS. It is\nfurther verified that these vectors are responsible for maintaining the roll\ncirculation that underlies the self-sustaining process (SSP) and in particular\nthe maintenance of the fluctuating streak that supports the parametric\nperturbation growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 21:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-27"}

Large-scale collaboration, when applying the steps of\nscientific investigation, is an efficient way to leverage \"crowd science\" to\naccelerate research in finance. In this paper, we demonstrate how a real world\nproblem in economics, an old problem still subject to a lot of debate, can be\nsolved by the application of a crowd-powered, collaborative scientific\ncomputational framework, fully supporting the process of investigation dictated\nby the modern scientific method.

We treat the drives non-perturbatively using\nFloquet theory, and find that the interference of the two drives can strongly\nalter the system dynamics even in the regime where the rotating wave\napproximation applies.

This can limit interpretability of the data and\nidentification of coherent features informative of ocean dynamics. Several\nmethods exist to fill gaps of missing oceanographic data, and are often based\non projecting the measurements onto basis functions or a statistical model.\nHerein, we use an information transport approach inspired from an image\nprocessing algorithm. This approach aims to restore gaps in data by advecting\nand diffusing information of features as opposed to the field itself. Since\nthis method does not involve fitting or projection, the portions of the domain\ncontaining measurements can remain unaltered, and the method offers control\nover the extent of local information transfer. This method is applied to\nmeasurements of ocean surface currents by high frequency radars. This is a\nrelevant application because data coverage can be sporadic and filling data\ngaps can be essential to data usability. Application to two regions with\ndiffering spatial scale is considered. The accuracy and robustness of the\nmethod is tested by systematically blinding measurements and comparing the\nrestored data at these locations to the actual measurements. These results\ndemonstrate that even for locally large percentages of missing data points, the\nrestored velocities have errors within the native error of the original data\n(e.g., $<10$% for velocity magnitude and $<3$% for velocity direction).

We also find an exact reformulation of the transition that\nleads to a simple field theory description that explicitly unifies the FM and\nVBS order parameters; this reformulation can be interpreted as a new parton\napproach that does not attempt to fractionalize either of the two order\nparameters but instead encodes them in instantons.

Viewed from this\nperspective, the paradigm of \"analogue space-times\" is to promote the specific\ntheory of general relativity (Einstein gravity) to a framework which covers\nrelativistic phenomena at large. Ultimately, this then also gives rise to new\nproposals for experiments in the laboratory, as it allows one to move general\nfeatures of the \"relativistic framework\" from general relativity to entirely\nnew fields. This allows experiments looking into analogies of currently\nunobservable phenomena of general relativity proper. The only requirement for\nthis to work is the presence of a notion of an upper limit for propagation\nspeeds in this new field. Systems of such a kind abound in physics, as all\nhyperbolic wave equations fulfil this requirement.\n  Consequently, models for analogue space-times can be found aplenty. We shall\ndemonstrate this here in two separate analogue space-time models, both taken\nfrom electrodynamics in continuous media.

Accurate models of\ngravitational waveforms are essential for unbiased and precise estimation of\nsource parameters. Recently developed surrogate models based on high-accuracy\nnumerical relativity (NR) simulations are ideal for constraining physical\nparameters of heavy black hole merger events. In this paper, we first\ndemonstrate the viability of these multi-modal surrogates as reliable parameter\nestimation tools. We show that NR surrogates can extract additional information\nfrom GW data that is inaccessible to traditional models, by analyzing a set of\nsynthetic signals with the NR surrogate and other approximants.\n  We also consider the case of two of the earliest binary black holes detected\nby the LIGO observatories: GW150914 and GW170104. We reanalyze their data with\nfully-precessing NR-surrogate templates and freely provide the resulting\nposterior samples as supplemental material. We find that our refined analysis\nis able to extract information from sub-dominant GW harmonics in data, and\ntherefore better resolve the degeneracy in measuring source luminosity distance\nand orbital inclination for both events. We estimate the sources of both events\nto be 20-25% further away than was previously estimated. Our analyses also\nconstrain their orbital orientation more tightly around face-on or face-off\nconfigurations than before. Additionally, for GW150914 we constrain the\neffective inspiral spin more tightly around zero. This work is one of the first\nto unambiguously extract sub-dominant GW mode information from real events. It\nis also a first step toward eliminating the approximations used in\nsemi-analytic waveform models from GW parameter estimation.

A cyclic chain of events inside a super-saturated\nenvironment in a thundercloud is proposed, each event enhancing the successive\nones until lightning occurs. These successive events are collision between\nsnowflakes and rimers, charge separation, corona discharge, avalanche\nionization, ionic wind originating from the positively and negatively charged\nmasses of cloud, vortex motion and turbulence when mixed with the updraft, more\ncollision, more charge separation, stronger corona discharge, and so on.\nMeanwhile, avalanche ionization would produce more CCN (cloud condensation\nnuclei) resulting in more precipitation and hence rimers formation in the\nsuper-saturated environment. More collision in the buoyant turbulence would\nlead to more fusion of droplets and the formation of larger rimers. The cyclic\nprocesses would repeat themselves until the electric field between the two\noppositely charged masses of cloud was strong enough to induce a breakdown. The\nlatter would create a sudden short circuit between the two charged masses of\ncloud neutralizing the charges. There would be no more ionic wind, hence, much\nless buoyant turbulence. The updraft alone would not be sufficiently strong to\nsupport larger rimers which would fall down 'suddenly' to the earth surface as\na rain gush.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 05:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-27"}

These\nprojective measurements are selective measurements in the sense that the\nmeasurement results are read out and only the case where all the measurement\nresults correspond to the initial state is considered in the analysis of the\neffect of the measurements. In this paper, we extend such a treatment to\nconsider the effect of repeated non-selective measurements - only the final\nmeasurement is required to correspond to the initial state, while we do not\nknow the results of the intermediate measurements. We present a general\nformalism to derive the effective decay rate of the initial quantum state with\nsuch non-selective measurements. Importantly, we show that there is a\ndifference between using non-selective measurements and the usual approach of\nconsidering only selective measurements only if we go beyond the weak\nsystem-environment coupling regime in models other than the usual population\ndecay models. As such, we then apply our formalism to investigate the quantum\nZeno and anti-Zeno effects for three exactly solvable system-environment\nmodels: a single two-level system undergoing dephasing, a single two-level\nsystem interacting with an environment of two-level systems, and a large spin\nundergoing dephasing. Our results show that the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno\neffects in the presence of non-selective measurements can differ very\nsignificantly as compared to the repeated selective measurement scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 05:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-27"}

It aims to recommend a\nsequence of places of interest (POIs) for a user to visit that maximizes the\nuser's satisfaction. When adding a POI to a recommended trip, it is essential\nto understand the context of the recommendation, including the POI popularity,\nother POIs co-occurring in the trip, and the preferences of the user. These\ncontextual factors are learned separately in existing studies, while in\nreality, they impact jointly on a user's choice of a POI to visit. In this\nstudy, we propose a POI embedding model to jointly learn the impact of these\ncontextual factors. We call the learned POI embedding a context-aware POI\nembedding. To showcase the effectiveness of this embedding, we apply it to\ngenerate trip recommendations given a user and a time budget. We propose two\ntrip recommendation algorithms based on our context-aware POI embedding. The\nfirst algorithm finds the exact optimal trip by transforming and solving the\ntrip recommendation problem as an integer linear programming problem. To\nachieve a high computation efficiency, the second algorithm finds a\nheuristically optimal trip based on adaptive large neighborhood search. We\nperform extensive experiments on real datasets.

We detail the resonant trapping comparing semi-analytical\nformulae and numerical simulations in the case of two equal-mass coplanar\nplanets trapped in first order resonances. We describe the family of resonant\nstable equilibrium points (zero-amplitude libration orbits) using expanded and\nnon-expanded Hamiltonians. We show that during convergent migration the planets\nevolve along these families of equilibria. Eccentricity damping from the disk\nleads to a final equilibrium configuration that we predict analytically. The\nfact that observed multi-exoplanetary systems are rarely seen in resonances\nsuggests that the resonant configurations achieved by migration can become\nunstable after the removal of the disk. We probe the stability of the\nresonances as a function of planetary mass. To do this, we fictitiously\nincrease the masses of the planets, adiabatically maintaining the low-amplitude\nlibration regime until instability. We discuss two hypotheses for instability:\nlow-order secondary resonance of the libration frequency with a fast synodic\nfrequency, and minimal approach distance between planets. We show that\nsecondary resonances do not seem to impact resonant systems at low-amplitude of\nlibration. Resonant systems are more stable than non-resonant ones for a given\nminimal distance at close encounters, but we show that the latter still play\nthe decisive role in the destabilisation of resonant pairs.

However, with the growing sophistication of the\nattacks and the complexity of the system, the protection using traditional\nmethods could be cost-prohibitive. A new perspective and a new theoretical\nfoundation are needed to understand security from a strategic and\ndecision-making perspective. Game theory provides a natural framework to\ncapture the adversarial and defensive interactions between an attacker and a\ndefender. It provides a quantitative assessment of security, prediction of\nsecurity outcomes, and a mechanism design tool that can enable\nsecurity-by-design and reverse the attacker's advantage. This tutorial provides\nan overview of diverse methodologies from game theory that includes games of\nincomplete information, dynamic games, mechanism design theory to offer a\nmodern theoretic underpinning of a science of cybersecurity. The tutorial will\nalso discuss open problems and research challenges that the CCS community can\naddress and contribute with an objective to build a multidisciplinary bridge\nbetween cybersecurity, economics, game and decision theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 09:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-27"}

ACPs can be detected on\npanoramic images. As these are one of the most common images performed for\nroutine dental practice, they can be used as a source of available data for\ncomputerized methods of automatic detection in order to significantly increase\ntimely diagnosis of ACPs. Recently, there has been a definite breakthrough in\nthe field of analysis of medical images due to the use of deep learning based\non neural networks. These methods, however have been barely used in dentistry.\nIn this study we used the Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster\nR-CNN) for deep learning.

The first gravitational-wave event GW170817 from a binary compact star\nmerger observed by the LIGO/VIRGO detectors have already put limits on the\ntidal deformability and provided constraints on the ultra-high nuclear density\nEOS. In view of this ground breaking discovery, we revisit and extend our\nprevious work [Phys. Rev. D 95, 101302(R) (2017)] which found that taking the\neffect of elasticity into account in the calculation of the tidal deformability\nof compact star models composed of crystalline color-superconducting (CCS)\nquark matter can break the universal I-Love relation discovered for fluid\ncompact stars. In this paper, we present our formulation in detail and provide\nmore analysis to complement our previous findings. We focus and extend the\nstudy of the screening effect on the tidal deformability, which we found\npreviously for hybrid star models, to various theoretical two-layer compact\nstar models. We show that the screening effect of these two-layer models in\ngeneral depends on the thickness of the envelope and the ratio between the\ndensity gap and the core density at the core-envelope interface. However, for\nmodels with a fluid envelope and a vanishing small density gap, the screening\neffect remains strong even as the thickness of the envelops tends to zero if\nthe quark matter core has a fairly uniform density. The relevance of our study\nto GW170817 is also discussed. Our study advocates that the tidal deformability\nnot only provides us information on the EOS, but may also give insights into\nthe multi-layer structure and elastic properties of compact star models\ncomposed of CCS quark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 12:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

Solar dynamo models of Babcock-Leighton type typically assume the\nrise of magnetic flux tubes to be instantaneous. Solutions with\nhigh-magnetic-diffusivity have too short periods and a wrong migration of their\nactive belts. Only the low-diffusivity regime with advective meridional flows\nis usually considered. Aims. In the present paper we discuss these assumptions\nand applied a time delay in the source term of the azimuthally averaged\ninduction equation. This delay is set to be the rise time of magnetic flux\ntubes which supposedly form at the tachocline. We study the effect of the\ndelay, which adds to the spacial non-locality a non-linear temporal one, in the\nadvective but particularly in the diffusive regime. Methods. Fournier et al.\n(2017) obtained the rise time according to stellar parameters such as rotation,\nand the magnetic field strength at the bottom of the convection zone. These\nresults allowed us to constrain the delay in the mean-field model used in a\nparameter study. Results. We identify an unknown family of solutions. These\nsolutions self-quench, and exhibit longer periods than their non-delayed\ncounterparts. Additionally, we demonstrate that the non-linear delay is\nresponsible for the recover of the equatorward migration of the active belts at\nhigh turbulent diffusivities. Conclusions. By introducing a non-linear temporal\nnon-locality (the delay) in a Babcock-Leighton dynamo model, we could obtain\nsolutions quantitatively comparable to the solar butterfly diagram in the\ndiffusion-dominated regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 13:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

A major drawback of such approaches is that it is not possible\nto evaluate the health impact of each pollutant.

Here the impact\nof Gaia parallaxes and implied distances on the space density of X-ray selected\ncomplete, flux-limited samples is studied. The samples are described in the\nliterature, those of non-magnetic CVs are based on ROSAT (RBS - ROSAT Bright\nSurvey & NEP -- North Ecliptic Pole), that of the Intermediate Polars stems\nfrom Swift/BAT.

A typical TSR approach ensures that structural profile\nelements covered by the original test suite are also covered by the reduced\ntest suite. It is plausible that structural profiles might be unable to\nsegregate failing runs from passing runs, which diminishes the effectiveness of\nTSR in regard to defect detection. This motivated us to explore state profiles,\nwhich are based on the collective values of program variables. This paper\npresents Substate Profiling, a new form of state profiling that enhances\nexisting profile-based analysis techniques such as TSR and coverage-based fault\nlocalization. Compared to current approaches for capturing program states,\nSubstate Profiling is more practical and finer grained. We evaluated our\napproach using thirteen multi-fault subject programs comprising 53 defects. Our\nstudy involved greedy TSR using Substate profiles and four structural profiles,\nnamely, basic-block, branch, def-use pair, and the combination of the three.\nFor the majority of the subjects, Substate Profiling detected considerably more\ndefects with a comparable level of reduction. Also, Substate profiles were\nfound to be complementary to structural profiles in many cases, thus, combining\nboth types is beneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 15:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-27"}

However, since the answers\ncollected from the recruited participants (workers) may contain sensitive\ninformation, crowdsourcing raises serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the problem of protecting answer privacy under local differential\nprivacy (LDP), by which individual workers randomize their answers\nindependently and send the perturbed answers to the task requester. The utility\ngoal is to enable to infer the true answer (i.e., truth) from the perturbed\ndata with high accuracy. One of the challenges of LDP perturbation is the\nsparsity of worker answers (i.e., each worker only answers a small number of\ntasks). Simple extension of the existing approaches (e.g., Laplace perturbation\nand randomized response) may incur large error of truth inference on sparse\ndata. Thus we design an efficient new matrix factorization (MF) algorithm under\nLDP. We prove that our MF algorithm can provide both LDP guarantee and small\nerror of truth inference, regardless of the sparsity of worker answers. We\nperform extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, and\ndemonstrate that the MF algorithm performs better than the existing LDP\nalgorithms on sparse crowdsourcing data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 15:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-27"}

As\nin earlier work which discussed the case of konwn threshold, we study the\nperformance of several bias correction methods: two versions of regression\ncalibration (RC1 and RC2), two versions of the fitting a model for the induced\nrelative risk (RR1 and RR2), maximum pseudo-partial likelihood estimator\n(MPPLE) and simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX). These correction methods are\ncompared with the naive estimator. We develop the relevant theory, present a\nsimulation study comparing the several correction methods, and illustrate the\nuse of the bias correction methods in data from the Nurses Health Study (NHS)\nconcerning the relationship between chronic air pollution exposure to\nparticulate matter of diameter 10 $\\mu$m or less (PM$_{10}$). The simulation\nresults suggest that the best overall choice of bias correction method is\neither the RR2 method or the MPPLE method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 08:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

The common\nproblem is that the latent parameters of many volatility models are\nhigh-dimensional and analytically intractable, which means inferences require\napproximations using, for example, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Laplace\nmethods. Some SV models are expressed as a linear Gaussian state-space model\nthat leads to a marginal likelihood, reducing the dimensionality of the\nproblem. Others are not linearized, and the latent parameters are integrated\nout. However, these present a quite restrictive evolution equation. Thus, we\npropose a Bayesian GED-Gamma SV model with a direct marginal likelihood that is\na product of the generalized Student's t-distributions in which the latent\nstates are related across time through a stationary Gaussian evolution\nequation. Then, an approximation is made for the prior distribution of\nlog-precision/volatility, without the need for model linearization. This also\nallows for the computation of the marginal likelihood function, where the\nhigh-dimensional latent states are integrated out and easily sampled in blocks\nusing a smoothing procedure.
