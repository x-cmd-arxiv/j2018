Simulation based bootstrap\nintervals have been proven useful in that their actual coverage probabilities\nare close to the nominal confidence level in small samples. Small samples\nanalytical approximations such as the Wald method, however, tend to have\ncoverage probabilities that greatly exceed the nominal confidence level.

For weak pinning, the skyrmions depin elastically,\nretaining sixfold ordering; however, at the onset of motion there is a dip in\nthe magnitude of the structure factor peaks due to a decrease in positional\nordering, indicating that the depinning transition can be detected using the\nstructure factor even within the elastic depinning regime. At higher drives the\nmoving skyrmion lattice regains full ordering. For increasing pinning strength,\nwe find a transition from elastic to plastic depinning that is accompanied by a\nsharp increase in the depinning threshold due to the proliferation of\ntopological defects, similar to the peak effect found at the elastic to plastic\ndepinning transition in superconducting vortex systems. For strong pinning and\nstrong Magnus force, the skyrmions in the moving phase can form a strongly\nclustered or phase separated state with highly modulated skyrmion density,\nsimilar to that recently observed in continuum-based simulations for strong\ndisorder. As the Magnus force is decreased, the density phase separated state\ncrosses over to a dynamically phase separated state with uniform density but\nwith flow localized in bands of motion, while in the strongly damped limit,\nboth types of phase separated states are lost.

By calculating the\nBogoliubov excitations of stationary axisymmetric composite vortices, we find\nnonreal excitation frequencies (dynamical instabilities) for the singly\nquantized $(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$ vortices and for all variants of doubly\nquantized vortices, which we define by the condition\n$\\max_{j=1,2}|\\kappa_j|=2$. While the short-time predictions of the linear\nBogoliubov analysis are confirmed by direct time integration of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equations of motion, the time integration also reveals\nintricate long-time decay behavior not captured by the linearized dynamics.\nFirst, the $(1,\\pm 1)$ vortex is found to be unstable against splitting into a\n$(1,0)$ vortex and a $(0,\\pm 1)$ vortex. Second, the $(2,1)$ vortex exhibits a\ntwo-step decay process in which its initial splitting into a $(2,0)$ vortex and\na $(0,1)$ vortex is followed by the off-axis splitting of the $(2,0)$ vortex\ninto two $(1,0)$ vortices. Third, the $(2,-2)$ vortex is observed to split into\na $(-1,1)$ vortex, three $(1,0)$ vortices, and three $(0,-1)$ vortices. Each of\nthese splitting processes is the dominant decay mechanism of the respective\nstationary composite vortex for a wide range of intercomponent interaction\nstrengths and relative populations of the two condensate components and should\nbe amenable to experimental detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 17:40:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 20:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

We find that this improves initial data constraint\nviolations near and inside the apparent horizons by about 3 orders of\nmagnitude. We construct several initial data sets that are intended to be\nastrophysically equivalent but use different free data, boundary conditions,\nand initial gauge conditions. These include free data chosen as a superposition\nof two black holes in time-independent horizon-penetrating harmonic and damped\nharmonic coordinates. We also implement initial data for which the initial\ngauge satisfies the harmonic and damped harmonic gauge conditions; this can be\ndone independently of the free data, since this amounts to a choice of the time\nderivatives of the lapse and shift. We compare these initial data sets by\nevolving them.

However, we do find small differences between these\nwaveforms, which we attribute to small differences in initial orbital\neccentricity, and in initial BH masses and spins, resulting from the different\nchoices of free data.

The anomaly is activated by driving transverse sound\nwaves through a Weyl semimetal with a spatially varying tilted dispersion,\nwhich can be engineered by applying strain.

Using a rotational\ndiagram analysis, we find a disk-averaged column density of $\\sim10^{17}$\ncm$^{-2}$ and a rotational temperature of $\\sim90-100$ K, suggesting that the\nmethanol has thermally desorbed from the dust grains. We derive outer radii\nbetween 120 and 140 AU for the different transitions, compared to the 360 AU\nouter radius for C$^{18}$O. Depending on the exact physical structure of the\ndisk, the methanol emission could originate in the surface layers beyond the\nwater snowline. Alternatively, the bulk of the methanol emission originates\ninside the water snowline, which can then be as far out as ~100 AU, instead of\n42 AU as was previously inferred from the continuum opacity. In addition, these\nresults show that outbursting young stars like V883 Ori are good sources to\nstudy the ice composition of planet forming material through thermally desorbed\ncomplex molecules, which have proven to be hard to observe in more evolved\nprotoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 18:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Unlike the well-known opinion formation game\non a social network, our game appears not to be a potential game, and the\nBest-Response dynamics is non-differentiable making the analysis of\nBest-Response dynamics non-trivial.\n  In our game, we consider two types of player behavior, namely optimistic or\npessimistic, based on how they use their time endowment over their neighbors.\nTo analyze Best-Response dynamics, we circumvent the problem of the game not\nbeing a potential game, through the lens of a novel two-level potential\nfunction approach.

For a relativistically transparent target, kinetic modeling shows that\nthe generation of energetic electrons is dominated by energy transfer within\nthe main, classically overdense, plasma volume. The laser pulse produces a\nnarrowing, funnel-like channel inside the plasma volume that generates a field\nstructure responsible for the electron heating. The field structure combines a\nslowly evolving azimuthal magnetic field, generated by a strong laser-driven\nlongitudinal electron current, and, unexpectedly, a strong propagating\nlongitudinal electric field, generated by reflections off the walls of the\nfunnel-like channel. The magnetic field assists electron heating by the\ntransverse electric field of the laser pulse through deflections, whereas the\nlongitudinal electric field directly accelerates the electrons in the forward\ndirection. The longitudinal electric field produced by reflections is 30 times\nstronger than that in the incoming laser beam and the resulting direct laser\nacceleration contributes roughly one third of the energy transferred by the\ntransverse electric field of the laser pulse to electrons of the\nsuper-ponderomotive tail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 19:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Despite several attempts, conclusive experimental\nobservation of the phenomenon remains elusive. One likely obstacle to\nidentification is a very small Kondo temperature scale $T_K$ in situations\nwhere the chemical potential lies near the Dirac point. We propose tailored\nmechanical deformations of monolayer graphene as a means of revealing unique\nfingerprints of the Kondo effect. Inhomogeneous strains are known to produce\nspecific alternating changes in the local density of states (LDOS) away from\nthe Dirac point that signal sublattice symmetry breaking effects. Small LDOS\nchanges can be amplified in an exponential increase or decrease of $T_K$ for\nmagnetic impurities attached at different locations. We illustrate this\nbehavior in two deformation geometries: a circular 'bubble' and a long fold,\nboth described by Gaussian displacement profiles.

The relatively new field of 4D\nPET direct reconstruction, by contrast, seeks to move beyond this scheme and\nincorporate information from multiple time frames within the reconstruction\ntask. Existing 4D direct models are based on a deterministic description of\nvoxels' TACs, captured by the chosen kinetic model, considering the photon\ncounting process the only source of uncertainty. In this work, we introduce a\nnew probabilistic modeling strategy based on the key assumption that activity\ntime course would be subject to uncertainty even if the parameters of the\nunderlying dynamic process were known. This leads to a hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel, which we formulate using the formalism of Probabilistic Graphical\nModeling (PGM). The inference of the joint probability density function arising\nfrom PGM is addressed using a new gradient-based iterative algorithm, which\npresents several advantages compared to existing direct methods: it is flexible\nto an arbitrary choice of linear and nonlinear kinetic model; it enables the\ninclusion of arbitrary (sub)differentiable priors for parametric maps; it is\nsimpler to implement and suitable to integration in computing frameworks for\nmachine learning. Computer simulations and an application to real patient scan\nshowed how the proposed approach allows us to weight the importance of the\nkinetic model, providing a bridge between indirect and deterministic direct\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 19:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

The exception is the zeroth LL, $n=0$, which is\nrobust to the bond disorder, since it does not mix different $n=0$ states\nwithin a given valley. The mechanism of broadening of the $n=0$ LL is the\ninter-valley scattering. Several numerical simulations of graphene with bond\ndisorder had established that $n=0$ LL is not only anomalously narrow but also\nthat its shape is very peculiar with three maxima, one at zero energy, $E=0$,\nand two others at finite energies $\\pm E$. We study theoretically the structure\nof the states in $n=0$ LL in the presence of bond disorder. Adopting the\nassumption that the bond disorder is strongly anisotropic, namely, that one\ntype of bonds is perturbed much stronger than other two, allowed us to get an\nanalytic expression for the density of states which agrees with numerical\nsimulations remarkably well. On the qualitative level, our key finding is that\ndelocalization of $E=0$ state has a dramatic back effect on the density of\nstates near $E=0$. The origin of this unusual behavior is the strong\ncorrelation of eigenstates in different valleys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 21:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

One layer of Successive Interference\nCancellation (SIC) is required at each receiver to remove the multicast stream\nbefore decoding its intended unicast stream. In this paper, we first show that\na linearly-precoded 1-layer Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy at the transmitter can\nefficiently exploit this existing SIC receiver architecture. We further propose\nmulti-layer transmission strategies based on the generalized RS and\npower-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA).

Passive stereo is applicable to capture dynamic scenes, however the\nshape with textureless surfaces or irregular reflections cannot be recovered by\nthe technique. In our system, we add a pattern projector to the stereo camera\npair so that artificial textures are augmented on the objects. To use the\nsystem at underwater environments, several problems should be compensated,\ni.e., refraction, disturbance by fluctuation and bubbles. Further, since\nsurface of the objects are interfered by the bubbles, projected patterns, etc.,\nthose noises and patterns should be removed from captured images to recover\noriginal texture. To solve these problems, we propose three approaches; a\ndepth-dependent calibration, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)-stereo method\nand CNN-based texture recovery method. A depth-dependent calibration is our\nanalysis to find the acceptable depth range for approximation by center\nprojection to find the certain target depth for calibration. In terms of CNN\nstereo, unlike common CNNbased stereo methods which do not consider strong\ndisturbances like refraction or bubbles, we designed a novel CNN architecture\nfor stereo matching using multi-scale information, which is intended to be\nrobust against such disturbances. Finally, we propose a multi-scale method for\nbubble and a projected-pattern removal method using CNNs to recover original\ntextures.

Smart traffic control enables\noperators to decrease traffic congestion and environmental impact by acquiring\nreal-time traffic data and changing traffic signals from fixed to adaptive\nschedules. However, these capabilities have inadvertently exposed traffic\ncontrol to a wide range of cyber-attacks, which adversaries can easily mount\nthrough wireless networks or even through the Internet. Indeed, recent studies\nhave found that a large number of traffic signals that are deployed in practice\nsuffer from exploitable vulnerabilities, which adversaries may use to take\ncontrol of the devices. Thanks to the hardware-based failsafes that most\ndevices employ, adversaries cannot cause traffic accidents directly by setting\ncompromised signals to dangerous configurations. Nonetheless, an adversary\ncould cause disastrous traffic congestion by changing the schedule of\ncompromised traffic signals, thereby effectively crippling the transportation\nnetwork. To provide theoretical foundations for the protection of\ntransportation networks from these attacks, we introduce a game-theoretic model\nof launching, detecting, and mitigating attacks that tamper with traffic-signal\nschedules.

For a crystal, such large coefficients can be achieved by matching\nphoton energies with resonant energies between different bands, and so the\ndetails of the crystal band structure play an important role. Here we\ndemonstrate that large third-order nonlinearities can also be generally\nobtained by a different strategy: As any of the incident frequencies or the sum\nof any two or three frequencies approaches zero, the doped or excited\npopulations of electronic states lead to divergent contributions in the induced\ncurrent density. We refer to these as intraband divergences, by analogy with\nthe behavior of Drude conductivity in linear response. Physically, such\nresonant processes can be associated with a combination of inraband and\ninterband optical transitions. Current-induced second order nonlinearity,\ncoherent current injection, and jerk currents are all related to such\ndivergences, and we find similar divergences in degenerate four wave mixing and\ncross-phase modulation under certain conditions. These divergences are limited\nby intraband relaxation parameters, and lead to a large optical response from a\nhigh quality sample; we find they are very robust with respect to variations in\nthe details of the band structure.

In order to detect OTFS\nmodulated data, the channel impulse response needs to be known at the receiver.\nIn this paper, we propose embedded pilot-aided channel estimation schemes for\nOTFS. In each OTFS frame, we arrange pilot, guard, and data symbols in the\ndelay--Doppler plane to suitably avoid interference between pilot and data\nsymbols at the receiver. We develop such symbol arrangements for OTFS over\nmultipath channels with integer and fractional Doppler shifts, respectively. At\nthe receiver, channel estimation is performed based on a threshold method and\nthe estimated channel information is used for data detection via a message\npassing (MP) algorithm. Thanks to our specific embedded symbol arrangements,\nboth channel estimation and data detection are performed within the same OTFS\nframe with a minimum overhead. We compare by simulations the error performance\nof OTFS using the proposed channel estimation and OTFS with ideally known\nchannel information and observe only a marginal performance loss. We also\ndemonstrate that the proposed channel estimation in OTFS significantly\noutperforms OFDM with known channel information. Finally, we present extensions\nof the proposed schemes to MIMO and multi-user uplink/downlink.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 05:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

Such classification has traditionally been based on spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs). An alternative approach is provided by supervised machine\nlearning algorithms. We attempt to classify a sample of Orion YSOs into\ndifferent classes, where each source has already been classified using\nmultiwavelength SED analysis. We used 8 different learning algorithms to\nclassify the target YSOs, namely a decision tree, random forest, gradient\nboosting machine (GBM), logistic regression, na\\\"ive Bayes classifier,\n$k$-nearest neighbour classifier, support vector machine, and neural network.\nThe classifiers were trained and tested by using a 10-fold cross-validation\nprocedure. As the learning features, we employed ten continuum flux densities\nspanning from the near-IR to submm. With a classification accuracy of 82% (with\nrespect to the SED-based classes), a GBM algorithm was found to exhibit the\nbest performance. The lowest accuracy of 47% was obtained with a na\\\"ive Bayes\nclassifier. Our analysis suggests that the inclusion of the 3.6 $\\mu$m and 24\n$\\mu$m flux densities is useful to maximise the YSO classification accuracy.\nAlthough machine learning has the potential to provide a rapid and fairly\nreliable way to classify YSOs, an SED analysis is still needed to derive the\nphysical properties of the sources, and to create the labelled training data.\nThe classification accuracies can be improved with respect to the present\nresults by using larger data sets, more detailed missing value imputation, and\nadvanced ensemble methods. Overall, the application of machine learning is\nexpected to be very useful in the era of big astronomical data, for example to\nquickly assemble interesting target source samples for follow-up studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 08:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

This suggests that\nthere could be a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty\nPrinciple or Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary\nparticles with $M < M_{P}$ and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the\npresence of $n$ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale $R_E$ exceeding\nthe Planck length $R_P$, one expects $R_S \\propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R_P < R <\nR_E$, which breaks this duality. However, it may be restored in some\ncircumstances because the {\\it effective} Compton wavelength of a particle\ndepends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is\nspherically symmetric, then one still has $R_C \\propto M^{-1}$, as in the\n$3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length is then increased and the\nPlanck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and black\nhole production at the LHC. However, if the wave function of a particle is\nasymmetric and has a scale $R_E$ in the extra dimensions, then $R_C \\propto\nM^{-1/(1+n)}$, so that the duality between $R_C$ and $R_S$ is preserved. In\nthis case, the effective Planck length is increased even more but the Planck\nmass is unchanged, so that TeV quantum gravity is precluded and black holes\ncannot be generated in collider experiments. Nevertheless, the extra dimensions\ncould still have consequences for the detectability of black hole evaporations\nand the enhancement of pair-production at accelerators on scales below $R_E$.\nThough phenomenologically general for higher-dimensional theories, our results\nare shown to be consistent with string theory via the minimum positional\nuncertainty derived from $D$-particle scattering amplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 09:18:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 11:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Although noiseprints can\nbe used for a large variety of forensic tasks, here we focus on image forgery\nlocalization. Experiments on several datasets widespread in the forensic\ncommunity show noiseprint-based methods to provide state-of-the-art\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 09:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

Moreover, since the\nrobustness of feature selection methods against noise and outlier is of great\nimportance, we adopt low-rank representation in our model. Also, we provide an\nefficient algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem. The\ncomputational cost of the proposed algorithm is lower than many\nstate-of-the-art methods which is of high importance in feature selection\ntasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments with various evaluation methods\non different benchmark data sets. These experiments indicate significant\nimprovement, compared with state-of-the-art feature selection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 12:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 02:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

Testing of DL systems has traditionally relied on manual collection\nand labelling of data. Recently, a number of coverage criteria based on neuron\nactivation values have been proposed. These criteria essentially count the\nnumber of neurons whose activation during the execution of a DL system\nsatisfied certain properties, such as being above predefined thresholds.\nHowever, existing coverage criteria are not sufficiently fine grained to\ncapture subtle behaviours exhibited by DL systems. Moreover, evaluations have\nfocused on showing correlation between adversarial examples and proposed\ncriteria rather than evaluating and guiding their use for actual testing of DL\nsystems. We propose a novel test adequacy criterion for testing of DL systems,\ncalled Surprise Adequacy for Deep Learning Systems (SADL), which is based on\nthe behaviour of DL systems with respect to their training data. We measure the\nsurprise of an input as the difference in DL system's behaviour between the\ninput and the training data (i.e., what was learnt during training), and\nsubsequently develop this as an adequacy criterion: a good test input should be\nsufficiently but not overtly surprising compared to training data. Empirical\nevaluation using a range of DL systems from simple image classifiers to\nautonomous driving car platforms shows that systematic sampling of inputs based\non their surprise can improve classification accuracy of DL systems against\nadversarial examples by up to 77.5% via retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 15:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

We show that the band gap and layer\nsplitting can be controlled by the field $E_z$. Away from the $k$ point, the\nintrinsic SOC splitting increases in the conduction band but is weakly affected\nin the valence band. We then analyze the band structure in the presence of a\nperpendicular magnetic field $B$ and the field $E_z$, including spin and valley\nZeeman terms, and evaluate the Hall and longitudinal conductivities. We discuss\nthe numerical results as functions of the fields $B$ and $E_z$ for finite\ntemperatures. The field $B$ gives rise to a significant spin splitting in the\nconduction band, to a beating in the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations when\nit's weak, and to their splitting when it's strong. The Zeeman terms and\n$E_{z}$ suppress the beating and change the positions of the beating nodes of\nthe SdH oscillations at low $B$ fields and enhance their splitting at high $B$\nfields. Similar beating patterns are observed in the spin and valley\npolarizations at low $B$ fields. Interestingly, a $90\\%$ spin polarization and\na $100\\%$ square-wave-shaped valley polarization are observed at high $B$\nfields. The Hall-plateau sequence depends on $E_z$. These findings may be\npertinent to future spintronic and valleytronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 19:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The increased aerosol content due to dust storms\nincreases the diffuse component of the solar radiation.

To do so, a C program $P$ has to be translated to an MSVL program M\nand the negation of a desired property $Q$ is also translated to an MSVL\nprogram M', then \"M and M\" is compiled and executed armed with MC.

Therefore, how to translate a C program\nto an MSVL program is a critical issue. However, in general, C is of\ncomplicated structures with goto statement. In this paper, we confine the\nsyntax of C in a suitable subset called Xd-C without loss of expressiveness.\nFurther, we present a translation algorithm from an Xd-C program to an MSVL\nprogram based on translation algorithms for expressions and statements.\nMoreover, the equivalences between expressions and statements involved in Xd-C\nand MSVL programs are inductively proved. Subsequently, the equivalence between\nthe original Xd-C program and the translated MSVL program is also proved. In\naddition, the proposed approach has been implemented by a tool called $C2M$.

In this paper, we proposed a\ntwo-stage segmentation framework based on 3D U-Net. In this framework, the\nsegmentation of each OAR is decomposed into two sub-tasks: locating a bounding\nbox of the OAR and segment it from a small volume within the bounding box, and\neach sub-tasks is fulfilled by a dedicated 3D U-Net. The decomposition makes\neach of the two sub-tasks much easier, so that they can be better completed.

In This theory all objects and interactions in\nnature are constituted by abstract purely quantum logical relations in time.\nSuch structures can be devided into binary alternatives, which are called\nUr-Alternatives with respect to this principle meaning, and this leads to a\ntensor space of many Ur-alternatives. The indistinguishability of the\nUr-alternatives yields two Hilbert spaces, the tensor space of symmetric and\nantisymmetric states under permutations of the Ur-alternatives. It is shown how\nthe structures in the symmetric space can be represented in a three dimensional\nreal position space connected to time according to special relativity.\nAccordingly this theory obtains ultimately a deep understanding of the\nEPR-paradox, since logic is independent of topological structures and causal\nrelations in space. The antisymmetric space, which because of the Pauli\nprinciple contains much less degress of freedem, yields the additional quantum\nnumbers of the elementary particles. Based on the demand for the highest\npossible symmetry in the tensor space, the Yang-Mills gauge theories of the\nstandard model as well as a translational gauge formulation of general\nrelativity in a purely quantum logical description are derived. The equations\ndetermine entanglements of states containing many Ur-alternatives and this\nconcept is the analogue to classical pointwise interactions between separated\nobjects. This means that the main structures of the SU(N)-interactions of the\nstandard model of elementary particle physics as well as gravitation according\nto general relativiy are unified in a purely quantum theoretical conceptional\nframework. Finally it is derived an extended version of the E8-group, the\nbiggest exceptional Lie-group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 18:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-10"}
