A well-known notable feature of the non-holonomic\nsystem is that the rolling sphere does not fall; its height function is bounded\nand oscillates harmonically up and down. The central issue of the present work\nis whether similar bounded behavior can be observed in the no-slip billiard\ncounterpart. Our main results are as follows: for circular cylinders in\ndimension $3$, the no-slip billiard has the bounded orbits property, and very\nclosely approximates rolling motion, for a class of initial conditions which we\ncall transversal rolling impact. When this condition does not hold,\ntrajectories undergo vertical oscillations superimposed to an overall downward\nacceleration. Considering cylinders with different cross-section shapes, we\nshow that no-slip billiards between two parallel hyperplanes in Euclidean space\nof arbitrary dimension are always bounded even under a constant force parallel\nto the plates; for general cylinders, when the orbit of the transverse system\n(a concept that depends on a factorization of the motion into transversal and\nlongitudinal components) has period two---a very common occurrence in planar\nno-slip billiards---the motion in the longitudinal direction, under no forces,\nis generically not bounded. This is shown using a formula for a longitudinal\nlinear drift that we prove in arbitrary dimensions. While the systems for which\nwe can prove the existence of bounded orbits have relatively simple transverse\ndynamics, we also briefly explore numerically a no-slip billiard system, namely\nthe stadium cylinder billiard, that can exhibit chaotic transversal dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 16:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-19"}

For the practical implementation, we also provide variance\nestimators and a distribution estimator using the jackknife and bootstrap\ntechniques for the two-scale DNN.

This study can\nbe regarded as a discrete counter-part of the work by Fujishige (1980) on the\nlexicographically optimal base and the principal partition of a base-polyhedron\nin continuous variables. The objective of Part II is two-fold. The first is to\noffer structural views from discrete convex analysis (DCA) on the results of\nPart I obtained by the constructive and algorithmic approach. The second\nobjective is to pave the way of DCA approach to discrete decreasing\nminimization on other discrete structures such as the intersection of M-convex\nsets, flows, and submodular flows.\n  We derive the structural results in Part I from fundamental facts on M-convex\nsets and M-convex functions in DCA. A direct characterization is given to the\ncanonical partition, which was constructed by an iterative procedure in Part I.\nThis reveals the precise relationship between the canonical partition for the\ndiscrete case and the principal partition for the continuous case. Moreover,\nthis result entails a proximity theorem, stating that every decreasingly\nminimal element is contained in the small box containing the (unique)\nfractional decreasingly minimal element (the minimum-norm point), leading\nfurther to a continuous relaxation algorithm for finding a decreasingly minimal\nelement of an M-convex set.

But its applicability\nis limited by the reliance on annotated examples, which are difficult to\nproduce at scale. Indirect supervision has emerged as a promising direction to\naddress this bottleneck, either by introducing labeling functions to\nautomatically generate noisy examples from unlabeled text, or by imposing\nconstraints over interdependent label decisions. A plethora of methods have\nbeen proposed, each with respective strengths and limitations. Probabilistic\nlogic offers a unifying language to represent indirect supervision, but\nend-to-end modeling with probabilistic logic is often infeasible due to\nintractable inference and learning. In this paper, we propose deep\nprobabilistic logic (DPL) as a general framework for indirect supervision, by\ncomposing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL models label decisions as\nlatent variables, represents prior knowledge on their relations using weighted\nfirst-order logical formulas, and alternates between learning a deep neural\nnetwork for the end task and refining uncertain formula weights for indirect\nsupervision, using variational EM. This framework subsumes prior indirect\nsupervision methods as special cases, and enables novel combination via\ninfusion of rich domain and linguistic knowledge. Experiments on biomedical\nmachine reading demonstrate the promise of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 00:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

There are no known very efficient algorithms\nfor computing the Diameter exactly. Thus, much research has been devoted to how\nfast this parameter can be approximated. Chechik et al. showed that the\ndiameter can be approximated within a multiplicative factor of $3/2$ in\n$\\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ time. Furthermore, Roditty and Vassilevska W. showed that\nunless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails, no\n$O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better\nthan $3/2$ in sparse graphs. Thus the above algorithm is essentially optimal\nfor sparse graphs for approximation factors less than $3/2$. It was, however,\ncompletely plausible that a $3/2$-approximation is possible in linear time. In\nthis work we conditionally rule out such a possibility by showing that unless\nSETH fails no $O(m^{3/2-\\epsilon})$ time algorithm can achieve an approximation\nfactor better than $5/3$.\n  Another fundamental set of graph parameters are the Eccentricities. The\nEccentricity of a vertex $v$ is the distance between $v$ and the farthest\nvertex from $v$.

The structure of the network can be deepened on demand\nby stacking additional layers using a drift detection method which not only\ndetects the covariate drift, variations of input space, but also accurately\nidentifies the real drift, dynamic changes of both feature space and target\nspace. DEVFNN is developed under the stacked generalization principle via the\nfeature augmentation concept where a recently developed algorithm, namely\ngClass, drives the hidden layer. It is equipped by an automatic feature\nselection method which controls activation and deactivation of input attributes\nto induce varying subsets of input features. A deep network simplification\nprocedure is put forward using the concept of hidden layer merging to prevent\nuncontrollable growth of dimensionality of input space due to the nature of\nfeature augmentation approach in building a deep network structure. DEVFNN\nworks in the sample-wise fashion and is compatible for data stream\napplications. The efficacy of DEVFNN has been thoroughly evaluated using seven\ndatasets with non-stationary properties under the prequential test-then-train\nprotocol. It has been compared with four popular continual learning algorithms\nand its shallow counterpart where DEVFNN demonstrates improvement of\nclassification accuracy. Moreover, it is also shown that the concept drift\ndetection method is an effective tool to control the depth of network structure\nwhile the hidden layer merging scenario is capable of simplifying the network\ncomplexity of a deep network with negligible compromise of generalization\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 08:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 03:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

An interfacial force\nfor N-phase systems is derived based on the previously developed perturbation\noperator and is then introduced into the model using a body force scheme, which\nhelps reduce spurious velocities. A generalized recoloring algorithm is applied\nto produce phase segregation and ensure immiscibility of three different\nfluids, where a novel form of segregation parameters is proposed by considering\nthe existence of Neumann's triangle and the effect of equilibrium contact angle\nin three-phase junction. The proposed model is first validated with three\ntypical examples, namely the interface capturing for two separate static\ndroplets, the Young-Laplace test for a compound droplet, and the spreading of a\ndroplet between two stratified fluids. This model is then used to study the\nstructure and stability of double droplets in a static matrix.

By\nincorporating the Raman sample between two phase-sensitive parametric\namplifiers that squeeze the light along orthogonal quadrature axes, the typical\nintensity measurement of the Raman response is converted into a\nquantum-limited, super-sensitive estimation of phase. The resonant Raman\nresponse in the sample induces a phase shift to signal-idler frequency-pairs\nwithin the fingerprint spectrum of the molecule, resulting in amplification of\nthe resonant Raman signal by the squeezing factor of the parametric amplifiers,\nwhereas the non-resonant background is annihilated by destructive interference.\nSeeding the interferometer with classical coherent light stimulates the Raman\nsignal further without increasing the background, effectively forming\nsqueezing-enhanced versions of CARS and SRS, where the quantum enhancement is\nachieved on top of the classical stimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 15:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 09:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 18:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 06:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network\n(FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localisation tasks simultaneously.\nThe architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining\nthe computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of\naddressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy.\nMoreover, the refinement step is designed to explicitly enforce a shape\nconstraint and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for\novercoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions and\nlarge slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful\n3D cardiac shapes. The proposed pipeline is fully automated, due to network's\nability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to\ninitialise atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects\nand 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension.

Not surprisingly, enforcing the\nboundary condition improves the rate of convergence, sometimes in a significant\nway. Enforcing the bright-field condition in the reconstruction can also remove\nthe linear phase ambiguity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 07:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 05:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 06:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

We demonstrate the\nextraction of the most important breast diagnosis features from the EHRs in a\nset of patients that underwent breast imaging. Based on the analysis,\nextraction of these terms would be useful for defining important features for\ndownstream tasks such as machine learning for precision medicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 01:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

Community detection is one of the\nmost popular and best-studied research topics in network science and has\nattracted attention in many different fields, including computer science,\nstatistics, social sciences, among others. Numerous approaches for community\ndetection have been proposed in literature, from ad-hoc algorithms to\nsystematic model-based approaches. The large number of available methods leads\nto a fundamental question: whether a certain method can provide consistent\nestimates of community labels. The stochastic blockmodel (SBM) and its variants\nprovide a convenient framework for the study of such problems. This article is\na survey on the recent theoretical advances of community detection. The authors\nreview a number of community detection methods and their theoretical\nproperties, including graph cut methods, profile likelihoods, the\npseudo-likelihood method, the variational method, belief propagation, spectral\nclustering, and semidefinite relaxations of the SBM. The authors also briefly\ndiscuss other research topics in community detection such as robust community\ndetection, community detection with nodal covariates and model selection, as\nwell as suggest a few possible directions for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 03:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-21"}
