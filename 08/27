I show that in the Newtonian\ndynamics reversibility is unaffected by the observer's retention of the\ninformation about the measurement outcome. By contrast -- even though quantum\ndynamics is unitary, hence, reversible -- reversing quantum evolution that led\nto a measurement becomes in principle impossible for an observer who keeps the\nrecord of its outcome. Thus, quantum irreversibility can result from the\ninformation gain rather than just its loss -- rather than just an increase of\nthe (von Neumann) entropy. Recording of the outcome of the measurement resets,\nin effect, initial conditions within the observer's (branch of) the Universe.\nNevertheless, I also show that observer's friend -- an agent who knows what\nmeasurement was successfully carried out and can confirm that the observer\nknows the outcome but resists his curiosity and does not find out the result --\ncan, in principle, undo the measurement. This relativity of quantum\nreversibility sheds new light on the origin of the arrow of time and elucidates\nthe role of information in classical and quantum physics.

They can potentially exploit an enormous amount of\ntraining data collected from vehicles in the field, but the volumes are too\nlarge to train offline naively. Not all training instances are equally valuable\nthough, and importance sampling can be used to prioritize which training images\nto collect. This approach assumes that objects in images are labeled with high\naccuracy. To generate accurate labels in the field, we exploit the\nspatio-temporal coherence of vehicle video. We use a near-to-far labeling\nstrategy by first labeling large, close objects in the video, and tracking them\nback in time to induce labels on small distant presentations of those objects.\nIn this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in several steps.\nFirst, we note that an optimal subset (relative to all the objects encountered\nand labeled) of labeled objects in images can be obtained by importance\nsampling using gradients of the recognition network. Next we show that these\ngradients can be approximated with very low error using the loss function,\nwhich is already available when the CNN is running inference. Then, we\ngeneralize these results to objects in a larger scene using an object detection\nsystem. Finally, we describe a self-labeling scheme using object tracking.\nObjects are tracked back in time (near-to-far) and labels of near objects are\nused to check accuracy of those objects in the far field.

This boundary value problem can be seen as a natural\ngeneralization of the classical Lyapunov matrix equation. We present a general\napproach for computing delay Lyapunov matrices and H2 norms for systems with\nmultiple discrete delays, whose applicability extends towards problems where\nthe matrices are large and sparse, and the associated positive semidefinite\nmatrix (the ``right-hand side' for the standard Lyapunov equation), has a low\nrank. In contract to existing methods that are based on solving the boundary\nvalue problem directly, our method is grounded in solving standard Lyapunov\nequations of increased dimensions. It combines several ingredients: i) a\nspectral discretization of the system of delay equations, ii) a targeted\nsimilarity transformation which induces a desired structure and sparsity\npattern and, at the same time, favors accurate low rank solutions of the\ncorresponding Lyapunov equation, and iii) a Krylov method for large-scale\nmatrix Lyapunov equations.

The calculations of electroweak (EW)\ncorrections in the Monte Carlo generators become of relevance. Precise\npredictions of Z-boson production and decay require classes of QED/EW/QCD\ncorrections, preferably in the manner which allows for separation from the QCD\ndynamics of the production. At LEP, calculations, genuine weak and lineshape\ncorrections were introduced into electroweak form-factors and Improved Born\nApproximation. This was well suited for so-called doubly-deconvoluted\nobservables around the Z-pole; observables for which the initial- and\nfinal-state QED real and virtual emissions are treated separately or integrated\nover. This approach to EW corrections is followed for LHC pp collisions. We\nfocus on the EW corrections to doubly-deconvoluted observables of Z to ll\nprocess, in a form of per-event weight and on numerical results. The\nreweighting technique of TauSpinner package is revisited and the program is\nenriched with the EW sector. The Dizet library, as interfaced to KKMC Monte\nCarlo of the LEP era, is used to calculate O(alpha) weak loop corrections,\nsupplemented by some higher-order terms. They are used in the form of look-up\ntables by the TauSpinner package. The size of the corrections is evaluated for\nthe following observables: the Z-boson resonance line-shape, the outgoing\nleptons forward-backward asymmetry, effective leptonic weak mixing angles and\nthe lepton distribution spherical harmonic expansion coefficients. Evaluation\nof the EW corrections for observables with simplified calculations based on\nEffective Born of modified EW couplings, is also presented and compared with\nthe predictions of Improved Born Approximation where complete set of EW\nform-factors is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 19:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 20:09:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 10:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

This directly\ntranslates into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in\nelectric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and\nother sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor\nat the top of the car which is an essential feature in autonomous vehicles.\nLiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to make\nrelevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from the\ncar. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as Tesla.\nThe existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical fields\nof visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given the\nsmaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a large amount\nof data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which becomes\nchallenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units inside the\ncar, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed cloud.\nHowever, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are difficult to\nbe met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a coordinated\nset of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an integrated view\nwith a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized decision making body\nwhich then sends the required control actions to the vehicles with a lower bit\nrate in the downlink and with the required latency.

This model\ngeneralizes single factor models relying on the multivariate normal\ndistribution and allows for symmetric and asymmetric tail dependence. We\ndevelop joint Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) within\nGibbs sampling. Thus we avoid information loss caused by the two-step approach\nfor margins and dependence in copula models as followed by Schamberger et\nal(2017). Further, the Bayesian approach allows for high dimensional parameter\nspaces as they are present here in addition to uncertainty quantification\nthrough credible intervals. By allowing for indicators for different copula\nfamilies the copula families are selected automatically in the Bayesian\nframework. In a first simulation study the performance of HMC is compared to\nthe Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach developed by Schamberger et\nal(2017) for the copula part.

J. Changlani et al. Phys. Rev. Lett 120, 117202 (2018)] -- a result\nthat holds for arbitrary magnetization -- we develop an exact mapping between\nits exact quantum three-coloring wavefunctions and the characteristic localized\nand topological magnons. This map, involving resonating two-color loops, is\ndeveloped to represent exact many-body ground state wavefunctions for special\nhigh magnetizations. Using this map we show that these exact ground state\nsolutions are valid for any $J_z/J \\geq -1/2$. This demonstrates the\nequivalence of the ground-state wavefunction of the Ising, Heisenberg and $XY$\nregimes all the way to the $J_z/J=-1/2$ point for these high magnetization\nsectors. In the hardcore bosonic language, this means that a certain class of\nexact many-body solutions, previously argued to hold for purely repulsive\ninteractions ($J_z \\geq 0$), actually hold for attractive interactions as well,\nup to a critical interaction strength. For the case of zero magnetization,\nwhere the ground state is not exactly known, we perform density matrix\nrenormalization group calculations. Based on the calculation of the ground\nstate energy and measurement of order parameters, we provide evidence for a\nlack of any qualitative change in the ground state on finite clusters in the\nIsing ($J_z \\gg J$), Heisenberg ($J_z=J$) and $XY$ ($J_z=0$) regimes,\ncontinuing adiabatically to the vicinity of the macroscopically degenerate\n$J_z/J=-1/2$ point.

They take the shape of\na rooted, directed, acyclic graph, and when parameterized with evolutionary\nparameters, such as divergence times and population sizes, they form a\ngenerative process of molecular sequence evolution. Early work on computational\nmethods for phylogenetic network inference focused exclusively on reticulations\nand sought networks with the fewest number of reticulations to fit the data. As\nprocesses such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) could be at play\nconcurrently with hybridization, work in the last decade has shifted to\ncomputational approaches for phylogenetic network inference in the presence of\nILS. In such a short period, significant advances have been made on developing\nand implementing such computational approaches. In particular, parsimony,\nlikelihood, and Bayesian methods have been devised for estimating phylogenetic\nnetworks and associated parameters using estimated gene trees as data. Use of\nthose inference methods has been augmented with statistical tests for specific\nhypotheses of hybridization, like the D-statistic. Most recently, Bayesian\napproaches for inferring phylogenetic networks directly from sequence data were\ndeveloped and implemented. In this chapter, we survey such advances and discuss\nmodel assumptions as well as methods' strengths and limitations.

It has\nbeen shown in the past that this model does not conserve volume, causing a\nmonotonic hydrostatic pressure variation with strain. This effect introduces a\nnovel concept in the theory of plasticity because determines that any fine\ngrained polycrystalline material will fail after a finite plastic strain. Here\nthe hydrostatic pressure dependence on strain is explicitly calculated and\nshown that has a logarithmic divergence which determines the strain to\nfracture. Comparison of theoretical results with strains to fracture given by\nmechanical tests of commercial alloys show very good agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 02:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

We develop several methods by which arbitrary\ncorrelators may be systematically evaluated in a limit where the local Hilbert\nspace dimension $N$ is large. First, the correlators are given by sums over\n'stacked' planar diagrams which are completely determined by the spectra of the\nindividual interactions and a dependency graph encoding the locality in the\nsystem. We then introduce 'heap freeness' as a generalization of free\nindependence, leading to a second practical method to evaluate the correlators.\nFinally, we generalize the cumulant expansion to a sum over 'dependency\npartitions', providing the third and most succinct of our methods. Our results\nprovide tools to study dynamics and correlations within extended quantum\nmany-body systems which conserve energy. We further apply the formalism to show\nthat quantum satisfiability at large-$N$ is determined by the evaluation of the\nindependence polynomial on a wide class of graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 03:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We model the impact of\nthis instability on the phasing of the gravitational wave signal using three\nparameters per star: an overall amplitude, a saturation frequency, and a\nspectral index.

This paper examines\noptimal abatement pathways under an exogenous constraint on cumulative\nemissions. Least cost abatement pathways have carbon tax rising at the\nrisk-free interest rate, but if endogenous learning or climate damage costs are\nincluded in the analysis, the carbon tax grows more slowly. The inclusion of\ndamage costs in the optimization leads to a higher initial carbon tax, whereas\nthe effect of learning depends on whether it appears as an additive or\nmultiplicative contribution to the marginal cost curve. Multiplicative models\nare common in the literature and lead to delayed abatement and a smaller\ninitial tax. The required initial carbon tax increases with the cumulative\nabatement goal and is higher for lower interest rates. Delaying the start of\nabatement is costly owing to the increasing marginal abatement cost. Lower\ninterest rates lead to higher relative costs of delaying abatement because\nthese induce higher abatement rates early on. The fraction of business-as-usual\nemissions (BAU) avoided in optimal pathways increases for low interest rates\nand rapid growth of the abatement cost curve, which allows a lower threshold\nglobal warming goal to become attainable without overshoot in temperature. Each\nyear of delay in starting abatement raises this threshold by an increasing\namount, because the abatement rate increases exponentially with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 07:46:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 12:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

In\nparticular, it is shown how the quantum annealing process is able to find\nglobal optima even in the case of problems that do not directly involve binary\nvariables. The problem addressed in this work is the following: taking a matrix\nV, find two matrices W and H such that the norm between V and the matrix\nproduct WH is as small as possible. The work is inspired by O'Malley's article\n[1], where the author proposed an algorithm to solve a problem very similar to\nours, where however the matrix H was formed by only binary variables. In our\ncase neither of the two matrices W or H is a binary matrix. In particular, the\nfactorization foresees that the matrix W is composed of real numbers between 0\nand 1 and that the sum of its rows is equal to 1.

The BeXB 4U 0115+63\nunderwent two major outbursts in 2015 and 2017. Our aim is to investigate\nwhether the structural changes in the disk expected during type II outbursts\ncan be detected through optical polarimetry. We present the first optical\npolarimetric observations and new optical spectra of the BeXB 4U 0115+63\ncovering the period 2013-2017.

We find significant changes in\npolarization degree and polarization angle and highly distorted line profiles\nduring the 2017 X-ray outburst. The degree of polarization decreased by $\\sim$\n1%, while the polarization angle, which is supposed to be related with the disk\norientation, first increased by $\\sim 10^{\\circ}$ in about two months and then\ndecreased by a similar amount and on a similar timescale once the X-ray\nactivity ceased.We interpret the polarimetric and spectroscopic variability as\nevidence for the presence of a warped disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 08:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

Additionally, recent observations showed anomalies in the\nrotation period distribution of open clusters main sequence early K-type stars\nthat cannot be reproduced by current angular momentum evolution model. In this\nwork, we study the parameter space of star-planet system's configurations to\ninvestigate if including the tidal star-planet interaction in angular momentum\nevolution models could reproduce these rotation period distribution's\nanomalies. To study this effect, we use a parametric angular momentum evolution\nmodel that allows for core-envelope decoupling and angular momentum extraction\nby magnetized stellar wind that we coupled to an orbital evolution code where\nwe take into account the torque due to the tides raised on the star by the\nplanet.

The stellar angular momentum is the most impacted\nby the star-planet interaction when the planet is engulfed during the early\nmain sequence phase. Thus, if a close-in Jupiter mass planet is initially\nlocated around 50\\% of the stellar corotation radius, a kink in the rotational\nperiod distribution opens around late and early K-type stars during the early\nmain sequence phase. Tidal star-planet interactions can create a kink in the\nrotation period distribution of low-mass stars, which could possibly account\nfor unexpected scatter seen in the rotational period distribution of young\nstellar clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 08:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 08:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Our method consists of\na modification of the two-dimensional constrained transport scheme. Our scheme\nshows convergence of second-order in space and the frequency of the propagation\nof whistler waves is accurate. We confirm previous results, namely that during\nthe collapse, the Hall effect generates a rotation of the fluid with a\ndirection in the mid-plane that depends on the sign of the Hall resistivity,\nwhile counter-rotating envelopes develop on each side of the mid-plane.\nHowever, we find that the predictability of our numerical results is severely\nlimited. The angular momentum is not conserved in any of our dense\ncore-collapse simulations with the Hall effect: a large amount of angular\nmomentum is generated within the first Larson core, a few hundred years after\nits formation, without compensation by the surrounding gas.

This paper investigates a shifted-Poisson (SP)\nmodel based likelihood function that uses the pre-log raw measurements that\nbetter represents the measurement statistics, together with a data-driven\nregularizer exploiting a Union of Learned TRAnsforms (SPULTRA). Both the SP\ninduced data-fidelity term and the regularizer in the proposed framework are\nnonconvex. The proposed SPULTRA algorithm uses quadratic surrogate functions\nfor the SP induced data-fidelity term. Each iteration involves a quadratic\nsubproblem for updating the image, and a sparse coding and clustering\nsubproblem that has a closed-form solution. The SPULTRA algorithm has a similar\ncomputational cost per iteration as its recent counterpart PWLS-ULTRA that uses\npost-log measurements, and it provides better image reconstruction quality than\nPWLS-ULTRA, especially in low-dose scans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 11:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 18:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 02:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

We consider the case where a Dirichlet\nboundary condition is imposed on the locally rough surface. This problem models\ninverse scattering of plane acoustic waves by a one-dimensional sound-soft,\nlocally rough surface; it also models inverse scattering of plane\nelectromagnetic waves by a locally perturbed, perfectly reflecting, infinite\nplane in the TE polarization case. We prove that the locally rough surface is\nuniquely determined by the phaseless near-field data generated by a countably\ninfinite number of plane waves and measured on an open domain above the locally\nrough surface. Further, a direct imaging method is proposed to reconstruct the\nlocally rough surface from the phaseless near-field data generated by plane\nwaves and measured on the upper part of the circle with a sufficiently large\nradius.

At\nsome positions, the [OI] line profiles match those of CO, at other positions\nthey are more similar to the [CII] profiles.

Currently, despite a diversity of chemical scaffolds\nall synthetic auxins have a carboxylic acid as the active core group. By\napplying bio-isosteric replacement we discovered that indole-3-tetrazole was\nactive by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry, showing that the\ntetrazole could initiate assembly of the TIR1 auxin co-receptor complex.

We then tested indole-3-tetrazole against the AFB5\nhomologue of TIR1, finding that binding was selective against TIR1, absent with\nAFB5. The kinetics of binding to TIR1 are contrasted to those for the herbicide\npicloram, which shows the opposite receptor preference as it binds to AFB5 with\nfar greater affinity than to TIR1. The basis of the preference of\nindole-3-tetrazole for TIR1 was revealed to be a single residue substitution\nusing molecular docking, and assays using tir1 and afb5 mutant lines confirmed\nselectivity in vivo. Given the potential that a TIR1-selective auxin might have\nfor unmasking receptor-specific actions, we followed a rational design, lead\noptimisation campaign and a set of chlorinated indole-3-tetrazoles was\nsynthesised.

As a result, network connectivity recovery is an important issue\nin this area. Existing solutions always need excessive movement of nodes and\nthus lead to low recovery efficiency in terms of the time and energy\nconsumption. In this paper, we for the first time study the issue of how to\nutilize cooperative communication technology to improve the connectivity\nrecovery efficiency in UAV networks. We propose a Cooperative Communication\nbased Connectivity Recovery algorithm for UAV Networks, named C3RUN. The key\nnovelty is C3RUN not only uses cooperative communication to enlarge node's\ncommunication range and thus achieve quick repair of network connectivity, but\nalso enables nodes to proactively move to better places for ensuring the\nestablishment of cooperative communication links. We conduct extensive\nsimulations to evaluate the performance of C3RUN. The simulation results reveal\nthat C3RUN can not only achieve connectivity recovery with less nodes and\nshorter distance to move, but also always finish recovery with less time, when\ncomparing with existing work.

Wind\nextremes are defined on the base of run theory: fixing a percentile-based\nthreshold of the wind speed distribution, a wind extreme is defined as a\nsequence of consecutive wind values (or duration of the extreme) above the\nthreshold. This definition allows to analyse the sequence of extremes as a\ntemporal point process marked by the duration of the extremes.

Therefore, we design the effective impedance of the\nantireflection coating to be the geometrical mean of the upper and lower\nmediums impedance and we choose its height to be a quarter of operating\nwavelength. Consequently, the reflection vanishes at the desired frequency and\nfractional bandwidth of 56% is achieved with a criterion of 10% reflectance\n(the refractive index of the substrate is assumed to be 4). The proposed\nstructure is symmetric in both directions. So, it is not sensitive to the\npolarization of the incident wave at normal incidence. Furthermore, we show\nthat using the multilayer Chebyshev matching transformer of transmission line\ntheory increases the bandwidth of the antireflection up to 107% at the expense\nof pass-band ripples.

The system supports spinor solitons of two types: conventional\n(symmetric) dark solitons and asymmetric half-dark solitons. They demonstrate\nessentially different behavior upon variation of the strength of spin-orbit\ncoupling. One-dimensional spin-orbit coupled dark solitons are usually\nunstable, while half-dark solitons can be stable. Two-dimensional dark solitons\nat early stages of the development of transverse instabilities turn into\nasymmetric snaking patterns and later into sets of vortex-antivortex solitons\nwith notably different shapes. Depending on the sign of spin-orbit coupling two\ndistinct instability scenarios are possible for such solitons, in which\nvortices in one component correspond to vortices or antivortices in other\ncomponent.

The LHCb Upgrade I will begin\noperation in 2020. Consolidation will occur, and modest enhancements of the\nUpgrade I detector will be installed, in Long Shutdown 3 of the LHC (2025) and\nthese are discussed here. The main Upgrade II detector will be installed in\nlong shutdown 4 of the LHC (2030) and will build on the strengths of the\ncurrent LHCb experiment and the Upgrade I. It will operate at a luminosity up\nto $ 2 \\times 10^{34} \\rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}$, ten times that of the Upgrade I\ndetector. New detector components will improve the intrinsic performance of the\nexperiment in certain key areas. An Expression Of Interest proposing Upgrade II\nwas submitted in February 2017. The physics case for the Upgrade II is\npresented here in more depth. $CP$-violating phases will be measured with\nprecisions unattainable at any other envisaged facility. The experiment will\nprobe $b\\to s \\ell^+\\ell^-$ and $b\\to d \\ell^+\\ell^-$ transitions in both muon\nand electron decays in modes not accessible at Upgrade I. Minimal flavour\nviolation will be tested with a precision measurement of the ratio of\n$B(B^0\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)/B(B_s^0\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-)$. Probing charm $CP$ violation at\nthe $10^{-5}$ level may result in its long sought discovery.

In both the case of inter/intraband currents and in the case of\ninstantaneous band populations, we propose definitions which are\ngauge-invariant, and thus allow these quantities to be calculated consistently\nin any gauge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 14:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

It remains a\nmajor challenge however to aggregate such datasets, as the time and monetary\ncost associated with collecting extensive annotations is extremely high. This\nis particularly the case for generating precise pixel-wise annotations in video\nand volumetric image data. To this end, this work presents a novel framework to\nproduce pixel-wise segmentations using minimal supervision. Our method relies\non 2D point supervision, whereby a single 2D location within an object of\ninterest is provided on each image of the data. Our method then estimates the\nobject appearance in a semi-supervised fashion by learning\nobject-image-specific features and by using these in a semi-supervised learning\nframework. Our object model is then used in a graph-based optimization problem\nthat takes into account all provided locations and the image data in order to\ninfer the complete pixel-wise segmentation. In practice, we solve this\noptimally as a tracking problem using a K-shortest path approach. Both the\nobject model and segmentation are then refined iteratively to further improve\nthe final segmentation. We show that by collecting 2D locations using a gaze\ntracker, our approach can provide state-of-the-art segmentations on a range of\nobjects and image modalities (video and 3D volumes), and that these can then be\nused to train supervised machine learning classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 13:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

It results that providing a solid foundation to enable BPMN\ndesigners to understand their models in a consistent way is becoming more and\nmore important. In our investigation we define and exploit a formal\ncharacterisation of the collaborations' semantics, specifically and directly\ngiven for BPMN models, to provide a classification of BPMN collaborations. In\nparticular, we refer to collaborations involving processes with arbitrary\ntopology, thus overcoming the well-structuredness limitations. The proposed\nclassification is based on some of the most important correctness properties in\nthe business process domain, namely safeness and soundness. We prove, with a\nuniform formal framework, some conjectured and expected results and, most of\nall, we achieve novel results for BPMN collaborations concerning the\nrelationships between safeness and soundness, and their compositionality, that\nrepresent major advances in the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 01:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}
