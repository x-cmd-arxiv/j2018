The discrete element method using particle configuration as input,\nallows a micromechanical interpretation on the acoustic response of a given\ngranular system. This paper compares static and dynamic numerical probing\nmethods, from which wave velocities are either deduced from elastic moduli or\nextracted from the time/frequency-domain signals. The dependence of wave\nvelocities on key characteristics, i.e., perturbation magnitude and direction\nfor static probing, and maximum travel distance and inserted signals for\ndynamic probing, is investigated. It is found that processing the\nfrequency-domain signals obtained from dynamic probing leads to reproducible\nwave velocities at all wavenumbers, irrespective of the perturbation\ncharacteristics, whereas the maximum travel distance and input signals for the\ntime domain analysis have to be carefully chosen, so as to obtain the same\nlong-wavelength limits as from the frequency domain. Static and dynamic probes\nare applied to calibrated representative volumes of glass beads, subjected to\ncyclic oedometric compression. Although the perturbation magnitudes are\nselected to reveal only the elastic moduli, the deduced wave velocities are\nconsistently lower than the long-wavelength limits at various stress states,\nand thus sensitive to sample size. While the static probes investigate the\ninfluence of stress history on modulus degradation, dynamic probing offers\ninsights about how dispersion relations evolve during cyclic compression.\nInterestingly, immediately after each load reversal the incremental behavior is\nreversibly elastoplastic, until it becomes truly elastic with further\nunload/reload. With repeating unload/reload, the P- or S-wave dispersion\nrelations become increasingly scalable with respect to their long-wavelength\nlimits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

The first is a single input channel network called\nSCSNet as the baseline architecture, and the second is the multi-channel input\nnetwork called StressNet. Accuracy analysis shows that StressNet results in\nsignificantly lower prediction errors than SCSNet on three loss functions, with\na mean relative error of 2.04% for testing. These results suggest that deep\nlearning models may offer a promising alternative to classical methods in\nstructural design and topology optimization.

However, when the frequencies become high and the\nwavelengths comparable with particle size, the details of the microstructure\nstart to play an important role. Here, a novel hydro-micromechanical numerical\nmodel is proposed by coupling the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with the\ndiscrete element method (DEM. The model allows to investigate the details of\nthe particle-fluid interaction during propagation of elastic waves While the\nDEM is tracking the translational and rotational motion of each solid particle,\nthe LBM can resolve the pore-scale hydrodynamics. Solid and fluid phases are\ntwo-way coupled through momentum exchange. The coupling scheme is benchmarked\nwith the terminal velocity of a single sphere settling in a fluid. To mimic a\npressure wave entering a saturated granular medium, an oscillating pressure\nboundary condition on the fluid is implemented and benchmarked with\none-dimensional wave equations. Using a face centered cubic structure, the\neffects of input waveforms and frequencies on the dispersion relations are\ninvestigated. Finally, the wave velocities at various effective confining\npressures predicted by the numerical model are compared with with Biot's\nanalytical solution, and a very good agreement is found. In addition to the\npressure and shear waves, slow compressional waves are observed in the\nsimulations, as predicted by Biot's theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The suppression of the 2nd-order anisotropy in the present\ncase results in a situation in which the zero-field splitting (ZFS) of the ST =\n6 ground state is dominated by 4th- and higher-order interactions.

We show that under these conditions, the\ntorus partition sum of the theory at $\\mu=0$ uniquely determines the partition\nsum (and thus the spectrum) of the perturbed theory, to all orders in $\\mu$, to\nbe that of a $\\mu J\\bar T$ deformed conformal field theory (CFT).

We find non-perturbative ambiguities for any non-zero\nvalue of $\\mu$, and comment on their possible relations to holography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 18:07:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 12:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

The results show the following.\nFirst, when there is an outstanding (in terms of Gini Index) prediction among\nthe candidates, the \"forecast combination puzzle\" phenomenon disappears. The\nsimple average method performs much worse than the more sophisticated model\ncombination methods, indicating that combining different methods could help us\navoid performance degradation. Second, the choice of the prediction accuracy\nmeasure is crucial in defining the best candidate prediction for \"low frequency\nand high severity\" (LFHS) data.

This intermediate attribute code has\na strong advantage over the common `one-hot' class representation because it\nallows for understanding complex and unseen patterns symbolically using\nattributes. First, each character is represented by four groups of attribute\ntypes to cover a wide range of character possibilities: Pinyin label, layout\nstructure, number of strokes, three different input methods such as Cangjie,\nZhengma and Wubi, as well as a four-corner encoding method. A convolutional\nneural network (CNN) is trained to learn these attributes.

Based on a\nnovel analysis of what it may mean for one tensor to depend in the proper way\non another, which, \\emph{en passant}, provides a precise characterization of\nthe idea of a `geometric object', I prove that, under certain natural\nconditions, there can be no tensor whose interpretation could be that it\nrepresents gravitational stress-energy in general relativity. It follows that\ngravitational energy, such as it is in general relativity, is necessarily\nnon-local. Along the way, I prove a result of some interest in own right about\nthe structure of the associated jet bundles of the bundle of Lorentz metrics\nover spacetime. I conclude by showing that my results also imply that, under a\nfew natural conditions, the Einstein field equation is the unique equation\nrelating gravitational phenomena to spatiotemporal structure, and discuss how\nthis relates to the non-localizability of gravitational stress-energy.

The optical emission of black hole transients increases by several\nmagnitudes during the X-ray outbursts.

We present the results\nof BVR polarisation measurements of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070\nduring the period of March-April 2018. Results. We detect small, $\\sim$0.7%,\nbut statistically significant polarisation, part of which is of interstellar\norigin. Depending on the interstellar polarisation estimate, the intrinsic\npolarisation degree of the source is between $\\sim$0.3% and 0.7%, and the\npolarisation position angle is between $\\sim10\\deg-30\\deg$. We show that the\npolarisation increases after MJD 58222 (2018 April 14). The change is of the\norder of 0.1% and is most pronounced in the R band. The change of the source\nStokes parameters occurs simultaneously with the drop of the observed V-band\nflux and a slow softening of the X-ray spectrum.

We suggest that the increased polarisation is due\nto the decreasing contribution of the non-polarized component, which we\nassociate with the the hot flow or jet emission. The low polarisation can\nresult from the tangled geometry of the magnetic field or from the Faraday\nrotation in the dense, ionised, and magnetised medium close to the black hole.\nThe polarized optical emission is likely produced by the irradiated disc or by\nscattering of its radiation in the optically thin outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 19:10:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 08:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

Specifically, we implement two sequence-to-sequence neural\nvariational models - variational autoencoders (VAE) and variational\nencoder-decoders (VED). VAEs for text generation are difficult to train due to\nissues associated with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term of the loss\nfunction vanishing to zero. We successfully train VAEs by implementing\noptimization heuristics such as KL weight annealing and word dropout. We also\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this continuous latent space through\nexperiments such as random sampling, linear interpolation and sampling from the\nneighborhood of the input. We argue that if VAEs are not designed\nappropriately, it may lead to bypassing connections which results in the latent\nspace being ignored during training.

The additional term is essential in certain antiferromagnets where\nmagnetic moments order in antiparallel ferromagnetic planes characterized by a\nnormal axis. In such antiferromagnets, we predict that the magnetostrictive\nstrain depends on the direction of the normal axis. Our findings are relevant\nfor materials such as NiO and CoO, where there is a new spin-structure\ndependent strain, but not in RbMnF$_3$. We propose an experimental procedure to\nverify the importance of our findings in NiO that can be readily generalized to\nother materials. We also generalize the theory to include long-wavelength\nmagnetoelastic coupling. We expect that the spin-structure dependent term\ncritically affects the magnon-phonon coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 19:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 07:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

There are two standard versions of the Gibbs\nsampler: The systematic scan (SS) version, where all variables are updated at\neach iteration, and the random scan (RS) version, where a single, randomly\nselected variable is updated at each iteration. The literature comparing the\ntheoretical properties of SS and RS Gibbs samplers is reviewed, and an\nalternative hybrid scan Gibbs sampler is introduced, which is particularly well\nsuited to Bayesian models with latent variables. The word \"hybrid\" reflects the\nfact that the scan used within this algorithm has both systematic and random\nelements. Indeed, at each iteration, one updates the entire set of latent\nvariables, along with a randomly chosen block of the remaining variables. The\nhybrid scan (HS) Gibbs sampler has important advantages over the two standard\nscan Gibbs samplers. Firstly, the HS algorithm is often easier to analyze from\na theoretical standpoint. In particular, it can be much easier to establish the\ngeometric ergodicity of a HS Gibbs Markov chain than to do the same for the\ncorresponding SS and RS versions. Secondly, the sandwich methodology developed\nin Hobert and Marchev (2008), which is also reviewed, can be applied to the HS\nGibbs algorithm (but not to the standard scan Gibbs samplers). It is shown\nthat, under weak regularity conditions, adding sandwich steps to the HS Gibbs\nsampler always results in a theoretically superior algorithm. Three specific\nBayesian hierarchical models of varying complexity are used to illustrate the\nresults. One is a simple location-scale model for data from the Student's $t$\ndistribution, which is used as a pedagogical tool.

However, the cost and\ncircuit complexity of having one radio frequency (RF) chain dedicated to each\nantenna element are prohibitive in practice. In this paper, we address this\ncritical issue in amplify-and-forward (AF) relay systems using a hybrid analog\nand digital (A/D) transceiver structure. More specifically, leveraging the\nchannel long-term properties, we design the analog beamformer which aims to\nminimize the channel estimation error and remain invariant over a long\ntimescale. Then, the beamforming is completed by simple digital signal\nprocessing, i.e., maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission (MRC/MRT)\nor zero-forcing (ZF) in the baseband domain. We present analytical bounds on\nthe achievable spectral efficiency taking into account the spatial correlation\nand imperfect channel state information at the relay station. Our analytical\nresults reveal that the hybrid A/D structure with ZF digital processor exploits\nspatial correlation and offers a higher spectral efficiency compared to the\nhybrid A/D structure with MRC/MRT scheme. Our numerical results showcase that\nthe hybrid A/D beamforming design captures nearly 95% of the spectral\nefficiency of a fully digital AF relaying topology even by removing half of the\nRF chains. It is also shown that the hybrid A/D structure is robust to coarse\nquantization, and even with 2-bit resolution, the system can achieve more than\n93% of the spectral efficiency offered by the same hybrid A/D topology with\ninfinite resolution phase shifters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 22:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The latter is in agreement with results from the FIRE\nsimulations, and it should encompass small scale properties of the interstellar\nmedium varying over time, which are not captured in SAMs, as well as other\nenergy sources in addition to SNe. Increasing $\\beta$ leads to stronger\nevolution of the MZR normalization; $\\beta = 1.9$ reproduces the observed MZR\nin the range $0 < z < 3.5$. A stronger redshift dependence of outflows reduces\nthe levels of star formation at earlier epochs with the consequent decrease of\nmetal production. This leads to a slower increase of the gas metallicity\ncompared to the stellar mass build-up. The cold gas can be contaminated either\nby receiving a direct injection of the material recycled by stellar winds and\nSNe or by gas cooling. The relative role of each process for a given stellar\nmass depends on the criterion adopted to regulate the fate of the recycled\nmaterial. However, modifying the metal loading of the outflows has mild impact\non the zero-point evolution and does not affect our conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 02:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Currently, the double decoupling method (DDM) and\nthe potential of mean force approach (PMF) methods are widely used to compute\nthe absolute binding free energy of biomolecules. The DDM relies on\nalchemically decoupling the ligand from its environments, which can be\ncomputationally challenging for large ligands and charged ligands because of\nthe large magnitude of the decoupling free energies involved. On the other\nhand, the PMF approach uses physical pathway to extract the ligand out of the\nbinding site, thus avoids the alchemical decoupling of the ligand. However, the\nPMF method has its own drawback because of the reliance on a ligand\nbinding/unbinding pathway free of steric obstruction from the receptor atoms.\nTherefore, in the presence of deeply buried ligand functional groups the\nconvergence of the PMF calculation can be very slow leading to large errors in\nthe computed binding free energy. Here we develop a new method called AlchemPMF\nby combining alchemical transformation with physical pathway to overcome the\nmajor drawback in the PMF method.

After 20\nns of simulation per umbrella sampling window, the new method yields absolute\nbinding free energies within ~1 kcal/mol from the experimental result, whereas\nthe standard PMF approach and the DDM calculations result in errors of ~5\nkcal/mol and > 2 kcal/mol, respectively.

This is achieved by estimating\nthe road model at time t_{n} and then controlling the search range for the\ndisparity estimation at time t_{n+1}. The lanes are then detected using our\npreviously published algorithm, where the vanishing point information is used\nto model the lanes. The experimental results illustrate that the runtime of the\ndisparity estimation is reduced by around 37% and the accuracy of the lane\ndetection is about 99%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 05:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

Discrete tomography is concerned with objects\nthat consist of a small number of materials, which makes it possible to compute\naccurate reconstructions from highly limited projection data. For cases where\nthe allowed intensity values in the reconstruction are known a priori, the\ndiscrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) has shown to yield accurate\nreconstructions from few projections. However, a key limitation is that the\nbenefit of DART diminishes as the number of different materials increases. Many\ntomographic imaging techniques can simultaneously record tomographic data at\nmultiple channels, each corresponding to a different weighting of the materials\nin the object. Whenever projection data from more than one channel is\navailable, this additional information can potentially be exploited by the\nreconstruction algorithm.

This class of\nalgorithms is a generalization of DART to multiple channels and combines the\ninformation for each separate channel-reconstruction in a multi-channel\nsegmentation step.

Here, we initiate a study of quantum\ninfinite-dimensional resonant systems, which are mathematically a highly\nspecial case of two-body interaction Hamiltonians (extensively researched in\ncondensed matter, nuclear and high-energy physics). Despite the complexity of\nthe corresponding classical dynamics, the quantum version turns out to be\nremarkably simple: the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal in the Fock basis, with\nall blocks of varying finite sizes. Being solvable in terms of diagonalizing\nfinite numerical matrices, these systems are thus arguably the simplest\ninteracting quantum field theories known to man. We demonstrate how to perform\nthe diagonalization in practice, and study both numerical patterns emerging for\nthe integrable cases, and the spectral statistics, which efficiently\ndistinguishes the special integrable cases from generic (chaotic) points in the\nparameter space.

In recent years, however, some\ntensions have emerged between different cosmological datasets that, if not due\nto systematics, could indicate the presence of new physics beyond the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. In the light of these developments, we evaluate the\nBayesian evidence against HZ in different data combinations and model\nextensions. Considering only the Planck temperature data, we find inconclusive\nevidence against HZ when including variations in the neutrino number $N_{\\rm\neff}$ and/or the Helium abundance $Y_{\\rm He}$. Adding the Planck polarization\ndata, on the other hand, yields strong evidence against HZ in the extensions we\nconsidered. Perhaps most interestingly, Planck temperature data combined with\nlocal measurements of the Hubble constant give as the most probable model an HZ\nspectrum, with additional neutrinos. However, with the inclusion of\npolarisation, standard $\\Lambda$CDM is once again preferred, but the HZ model\nwith extra neutrinos is not strongly disfavored. The possibility of fully\nruling out the HZ spectrum is therefore ultimately connected with the solution\nto current tensions between cosmological datasets. If these tensions are\nconfirmed by future data, then new physical mechanisms could be at work and an\nHZ spectrum could still offer a valid alternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 09:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Traditionally, deep regression employs\nthe L2 loss function, known to be sensitive to outliers, i.e. samples that\neither lie at an abnormal distance away from the majority of the training\nsamples, or that correspond to wrongly annotated targets. This means that,\nduring back-propagation, outliers may bias the training process due to the high\nmagnitude of their gradient. In this paper, we propose DeepGUM: a deep\nregression model that is robust to outliers thanks to the use of a\nGaussian-uniform mixture model. We derive an optimization algorithm that\nalternates between the unsupervised detection of outliers using\nexpectation-maximization, and the supervised training with cleaned samples\nusing stochastic gradient descent. DeepGUM is able to adapt to a continuously\nevolving outlier distribution, avoiding to manually impose any threshold on the\nproportion of outliers in the training set. Extensive experimental evaluations\non four different tasks (facial and fashion landmark detection, age and head\npose estimation) lead us to conclude that our novel robust technique provides\nreliability in the presence of various types of noise and protection against a\nhigh percentage of outliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 10:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

The basic idea is that concurrent processes\n(agents) can be understood as corresponding to players in a game; plays\nrepresent the possible computation runs of the system; and strategies define\nthe behaviour of agents. Typically, strategies are modelled as functions from\nsequences of system states to player actions. Analysing a system in such a\nsetting involves computing the set of (Nash) equilibria in the concurrent game.\nHowever, we show that, with respect to the above model of strategies (arguably,\nthe \"standard\" model in the computer science literature), bisimilarity does not\npreserve the existence of Nash equilibria. Thus, two concurrent games which are\nbehaviourally equivalent from a semantic perspective, and which from a logical\nperspective satisfy the same temporal logic formulae, may nevertheless have\nfundamentally different properties (solutions) from a game theoretic\nperspective. Our aim in this paper is to explore the issues raised by this\ndiscovery. After illustrating the issue by way of a motivating example, we\npresent three models of strategies with respect to which the existence of Nash\nequilibria is preserved under bisimilarity. We use some of these models of\nstrategies to provide new semantic foundations for logics for strategic\nreasoning, and investigate restricted scenarios where bisimilarity can be shown\nto preserve the existence of Nash equilibria with respect to the conventional\nmodel of strategies in the computer science literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 10:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 11:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 10:17:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 08:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 09:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

While passive\ndiffusion is often sufficiently fast for the transport of smaller cargo, active\ntransport is necessary to organize large structures on short timescales. The\nmain mechanism of this transport is by cargo attachment to motors which walk in\na directed fashion along intracellular filaments. There are a number of models\nwhich seek to describe the motion of motors with attached cargo, from detailed\nmicroscopic to coarse phenomenological descriptions. We focus on the\nintermediate-detailed discrete stochastic hopping models, and explore how cargo\ntransport changes depending on the number of motors, motor interaction, system\nconstraints and rate formulations which are derived from common thermodynamic\nassumptions. We find that, despite obeying the same detailed balance\nconstraint, the choice of rate formulation considerably affects the\ncharacteristics of the overall motion of the system, with one rate formulation\nexhibiting novel behavior of loaded motor groups moving faster than a single\nunloaded motor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 11:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

We find that a residual X-ray image from the\nChandra X-ray Observatory after removing the global emission shows a clear\ndipolar pattern characteristic of gas sloshing, whereas we find no significant\nresidual in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) image from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We estimate the equation of state of\nperturbations in the gas from the X-ray and SZE residual images. The inferred\nvelocity is 420 +310 -420 km s-1, which is much lower than the adiabatic sound\nspeed of the intracluster medium in the core. We thus conclude that the\nperturbation is nearly isobaric, and gas sloshing motion is consistent with\nbeing in pressure equilibrium. Next, we report evidence for gas stripping of an\ninfalling subcluster, which likely shock-heats gas to high temperature well in\nexcess of 20 keV. Using mass distribution inferred from strong lensing images\nof the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find that the mass peak is located away\nfrom the peak position of stripped gas with statistical significance of >\n5{\\sigma}. Unlike for the gas sloshing, the velocity inferred from the equation\nof state of the excess hot gas is comparable to the adiabatic sound speed\nexpected for the 20 keV intracluster medium.

The QC points are located at the\nendpoints of magnetization plateaus and separate gapped and gapless phases. In\none dimension, the low-energy excitations of the gapless phase form a Luttinger\nliquid (LL), and crossover lines bound insulating (plateau) and LL regimes, as\nwell as the QC regime. Alternating ferrimagnetic chains have a spontaneous\nmagnetization at $T=0$ and gapped excitations at zero field. Besides the\nplateau at the fully polarized (FP) magnetization; due to the gap, there is\nanother magnetization plateau at the ferrimagnetic (FRI) magnetization. We\ndevelop spin-wave theories to study the thermal properties of these chains\nunder an applied magnetic field: one from the FRI classical state, and other\nfrom the FP state, comparing their results with quantum Monte Carlo data. We\ndeepen the theory from the FP state, obtaining the crossover lines in the $T$\nvs. $B$ low-$T$ phase diagram. In particular, from local extreme points in the\nsusceptibility and magnetization curves, we identify the crossover between an\nLL regime formed by excitations from the FRI state to another built from\nexcitations of the FP state. These two LL regimes are bounded by an asymmetric\ndome-like crossover line, as observed in the phase diagram of other quantum\nmagnets under an applied magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 12:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

This shows that software will play an increasingly\nimportant role within telecommunication services, which were previously\ndominated by hardware appliances. Service providers can benefit from this, as\nit enables faster introduction of new telecom services, combined with an agile\nset of possibilities to optimize and fine-tune their operations. However, the\nprovided telecom services can only evolve if the adequate software tools are\navailable. In this article, we explain how the development, deployment and\nmaintenance of such an SDN/NFV-based telecom service puts specific requirements\non the platform providing it. A Software Development Kit (SDK) is introduced,\nallowing service providers to adequately design, test and evaluate services\nbefore they are deployed in production and also update them during their\nlifetime. This continuous cycle between development and operations, a concept\nknown as DevOps, is a well known strategy in software development.

By giving an overview of\nthe currently available tools and their limitations, the gaps in DevOps for\nSDN/NFV services are highlighted. The benefit of such an SDK is illustrated by\na secure content delivery network service (enhanced with deep packet inspection\nand elastic routing capabilities). With this use-case, the dynamics between\ndeveloping and deploying a service are further illustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 12:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-29"}

However, most of existing\nwork only concentrates on learning shared feature representation by minimizing\nthe distribution discrepancy across different domains. Due to the fact that all\nthe domain alignment approaches can only reduce, but not remove the domain\nshift.

Extensive experiments show that learning the\ndiscriminative features in the shared feature space can significantly boost the\nperformance of deep domain adaptation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 15:04:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2018 07:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

The redshifted absorption arises in a column of highly\nionized matter close to the black hole, with a line-of-sight velocity, $v \\sim\n0.3c$, inconsistent with the standard picture of a plane circular accretion\ndisc. This may represent the first direct evidence for chaotic accretion in\nAGN, where accretion discs are generally misaligned to the black hole spin. For\nsufficient inclinations, the Lense-Thirring effect can break the discs into\ndiscrete rings, which then precess, collide and shock, causing near free-fall\nof gas towards the black hole. The observed accretion rate for the reported\ninfall is comparable to the hard X-ray luminosity in PG1211+143, suggesting\nthat direct infall may be a significant contributor to inner disc accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 15:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

We tackle this task by introducing a notion of\ntemporal core decomposition where each core is associated with its span: we\ncall such cores span-cores.\n  As the total number of time intervals is quadratic in the size of the\ntemporal domain $T$ under analysis, the total number of span-cores is quadratic\nin $|T|$ as well. Our first contribution is an algorithm that, by exploiting\ncontainment properties among span-cores, computes all the span-cores\nefficiently. Then, we focus on the problem of finding only the maximal\nspan-cores, i.e., span-cores that are not dominated by any other span-core by\nboth the coreness property and the span. We devise a very efficient algorithm\nthat exploits theoretical findings on the maximality condition to directly\ncompute the maximal ones without computing all span-cores.\n  Experimentation on several real-world temporal networks confirms the\nefficiency and scalability of our methods.

In particular,\nthe so-called intermediate cities present a context and requirements different\nfrom those of large cities with respect to smart cities. One aspect of\nrelevance is to encourage the development of applications (generally for mobile\ndevices) that enable citizens to take advantage of data and services normally\nassociated with the city, for example, in the urban mobility domain. In this\nwork, a platform is proposed for intermediate cities that provide \"high level\"\nservices and that allow the construction of software applications that consume\nthose services. Our platform-centric strategy focused aims to integrate systems\nand heterogeneous data sources, and provide \"intelligent\" services to different\napplications. Examples of these services include: construction of user\nprofiles, recommending local events, and collaborative sensing based on data\nmining techniques, among others. In this work, the design of this platform\n(currently in progress) is described, and experiences of applications for urban\nmobility are discussed, which are being migrated in the form of reusable\nservices provided by the platform\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 01:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

Due to the\ndifferent limitations imposed by those media, but also to the very large amount\nof information, it is impossible to collect all the data produced by social\nnetworks such as Twitter. Therefore, to be able to gather enough relevant\ninformation related to a predefined need, it is necessary to focus on a subset\nof the information sources. In this work, we focus on user-centered data\ncapture and consider each account of a social network as a source that can be\nlistened to at each iteration of a data capture process, in order to collect\nthe corresponding produced contents. This process, whose aim is to maximize the\nquality of the information gathered, is constrained by the number of users that\ncan be monitored simultaneously. The problem of selecting a subset of accounts\nto listen to over time is a sequential decision problem under constraints,\nwhich we formalize as a bandit problem with multiple selections. Therefore, we\npropose several bandit models to identify the most relevant users in real time.\nFirst, we study of the case of the stochastic bandit, in which each user\ncorresponds to a stationary distribution. Then, we introduce two contextual\nbandit models, one stationary and the other non stationary, in which the\nutility of each user can be estimated by assuming some underlying structure in\nthe reward space. The first approach introduces the notion of profile, which\ncorresponds to the average behavior of a user. The second approach takes into\naccount the activity of a user in order to predict his future behavior.\nFinally, we are interested in models that are able to tackle complex temporal\ndependencies between users, with the use of a latent space within which the\ninformation transits from one iteration to the other. Each of the proposed\napproaches is validated on both artificial and real datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 05:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

The family admits a\nspecific decomposition as the product of an upper and a lower triangular\nmatrices having an increasing number of real parameters in predefined\npositions. Similar matrices appear naturally when solving some kinds of optimal\ncontrol problems. In our case, as stated by Nehari's theorem, the eigenvalues\nand eigenvectors fully characterize the solution. Commonly, such problems are\nsolved by numerical means, making it difficult to obtain insight in the role\nthat the parameters play on the solution. Our results provide a framework that\nenables to compute individually, under some simple assumptions, the eigenvalues\nof the matrices as roots of a monotone transcendental function with many\ndesirable properties. In order to do so, we first obtain a three-term recursive\ncharacterization of the corresponding characteristic polynomials. This enables\nthe aforementioned representation. Our framework also allows for the\ncomputation of bounds, numerical methods and even analytical characterizations\nwith closed form solutions, whenever the problem parameters satisfy simple\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 22:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

We present a\ntransformational approach to CAN IDS that exploits the geometric properties of\nCAN data to inform two novel detectors--one based on distance from a learned,\nlower dimensional manifold and the other on discontinuities of the manifold\nover time. Proof-of-concept tests are presented by implementing a potential\nattack approach on a driving vehicle. The initial results suggest that (1) the\nfirst detector requires additional refinement but does hold promise; (2) the\nsecond detector gives a clear, strong indicator of the attack; and (3) the\nalgorithms keep pace with high-speed CAN messages. As our approach is\ndata-driven it provides a vehicle-agnostic IDS that eliminates the need to\nreverse engineer CAN messages and can be ported to an after-market plugin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 14:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

This method can help reduce the demand for\nexpensive data by making use of additional inexpensive data. First, we\ndemonstrate that in predicting the transmission from multilayer photonic film,\nthe relative error rate is reduced by 46.8% (26.5%) when the source data comes\nfrom 10-layer (8-layer) films and the target data comes from 8-layer (10-layer)\nfilms.

We hypothesize that this calibration issue for a secondary\nanalysis may become an important source of artifacts in patient monitor data.\nWe test an off-the-shelf integrated photoplethysmography (PPG) and\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device for its ability to yield a reliable\npulse transit time (PTT) signal.

Given that the base stations are the\nnetwork elements that use most of this energy, much research has dealt with\nways to reduce the energy used by the base stations by turning them off during\nperiods of low load. In addition to this, installing a solar harvesting sys-\ntem composed of solar panels, batteries, charge con- trollers and inverters is\nanother way to further reduce the network environmental impact and some\nresearch has been dealing with this for individual base stations. In this\npaper, we show that both techniques are tightly coupled. We propose a\nmathematical model that captures the synergy between solar installation over a\nnetwork and the dynamic operation of energy-managed base stations. We study the\ninteractions between the two methods for networks of hundreds of base stations\nand show that the order in which each method is intro- duced into the system\ndoes make a difference in terms of cost and performance. We also show that\ninstalling solar is not always the best solution even when the unit cost of the\nsolar energy is smaller than the grid cost. We conclude that planning the solar\ninstallation and energy management of the base stations have to be done\njointly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 22:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}
