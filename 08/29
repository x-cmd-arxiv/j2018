Replacing the forward model with a\nlow-cost, low-fidelity model often significantly reduces computational cost;\nhowever, employing a low-fidelity model alone means that the stationary\ndistribution of the MCMC chain is the posterior distribution corresponding to\nthe low-fidelity model, rather than the original posterior distribution\ncorresponding to the high-fidelity model. We propose a multifidelity approach\nthat combines, rather than replaces, the high-fidelity model with a\nlow-fidelity model. First, the low-fidelity model is used to construct a\ntransport map that deterministically couples a reference Gaussian distribution\nwith an approximation of the low-fidelity posterior. Then, the high-fidelity\nposterior distribution is explored using a non-Gaussian proposal distribution\nderived from the transport map. This multifidelity \"preconditioned\" MCMC\napproach seeks efficient sampling via a proposal that is explicitly tailored to\nthe posterior at hand and that is constructed efficiently with the low-fidelity\nmodel. By relying on the low-fidelity model only to construct the proposal\ndistribution, our approach guarantees that the stationary distribution of the\nMCMC chain is the high-fidelity posterior.

Semantic textual similarity (STS) that measures the\nsemantic similarity between text snippets plays a significant role in many NLP\napplications. In the general NLP domain, STS shared tasks have made available a\nhuge collection of text snippet pairs with manual annotations in various\ndomains. In the clinical domain, STS can enable us to detect and eliminate\nredundant information that may lead to a reduction in cognitive burden and an\nimprovement in the clinical decision-making process.

A subset of MedSTS (MedSTS_ann) containing 1,068 sentence pairs\nwas annotated by two medical experts with semantic similarity scores of 0-5\n(low to high similarity).

In guarded systems, processes transitions are enabled or disabled\ndepending on the existence of other processes in certain local states. The\nexisting cutoff results for guarded protocols are restricted to closed systems,\nand are of limited use for liveness properties.

For\nthese cases, we compare our approximate scaling relations to the density\nresponse generated by satellites, and find that for two satellite interactions,\nour scaling relations approximately recover the response of the galactic disk.\nWe have also examined the observed HI data in the outskirts of several spiral\ngalaxies from the THINGS sample and compared the observed perturbations to that\nof cosmological simulations and our own scaling relations. While small\nperturbations can be excited by satellites drawn from cosmological simulations,\nwe find that large perturbations (such as those that are seen in some THINGS\ngalaxies like M51) are not recovered by satellites drawn from cosmological\nsimulations that are similar to Milky Way galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

Stellar evolution codes predict that the He\nflash consists of a series of consecutive subflashes. The detection of mixed\nmodes in red giants from space missions CoRoT and Kepler has opened new\nopportunities to search for stars in this evolution stage. During a subflash,\nthe He burning shell is convective, which splits the cavity of gravity modes in\ntwo. We here investigate how this additional cavity modifies the oscillation\nspectrum of the star. We calculate the asymptotic mode frequencies of stellar\nmodels going through a He subflash using the JWKB approximation. To predict the\ndetectability of the modes, we estimate their expected heights, taking into\naccount the effects of radiative damping in the core. Our results are then\ncompared to the oscillation spectra obtained by calculating numerically the\nmode frequencies during a He subflash. We show that during a He subflash, the\ndetectable oscillation spectrum mainly consists of modes trapped in the\nacoustic cavity and in the outer g-mode cavity. The spectrum should thus\nresemble that of a core-helium-burning giant. However, we find a list of clear,\ndetectable features that could enable us to identify red giants passing through\na He subflash. In particular, during a He subflash, several modes that are\ntrapped in the innermost g-mode cavity are expected to be detectable. We show\nthat these modes could be identified by their frequencies or by their\nrotational splittings. Other features, such as the measured period spacing of\ngravity modes or the location of the H-burning shell within the g-mode cavity\ncould also be used to identify stars going through a He subflash.

First, astrophysical and geophysical studies provide a timescale for\nthe formation of Earth and the Moon, for large impact events on early Earth,\nand for the cooling of the early magma ocean. From this evidence, we can deduce\na habitability boundary, which is the earliest point at which Earth became\nhabitable. Second, biosignatures in geological samples, including microfossils,\nstromatolites, and chemical isotope ratios, provide evidence for when life was\nactually present. From these observations we can deduce a biosignature\nboundary, which is the earliest point at which there is clear evidence that\nlife existed. Studies with molecular phylogenetics and records of the changing\nlevel of oxygen in the atmosphere give additional information that helps to\ndetermine the biosignature boundary. Here, we review the data from a wide range\nof disciplines to summarize current information on the timings of these two\nboundaries. The habitability boundary could be as early as 4.5 Ga, the earliest\npossible estimate of the time at which Earth had a stable crust and\nhydrosphere, or as late as 3.9 Ga, the end of the period of heavy meteorite\nbombardment. The lack of consensus on whether there was a late heavy meteorite\nbombardment that was significant enough to prevent life is the largest\nuncertainty in estimating the time of the habitability boundary. The\nbiosignature boundary is more closely constrained. Evidence from carbon isotope\nratios and stromatolite fossils both point to a time close to 3.7 Ga. Life must\nhave emerged in the interval between these two boundaries. The time taken for\nlife to appear could, therefore, be within 200 Myr or as long as 800 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

We aim at estimating the reliability of the 3D model atmosphere using\nnot only the line intensity but the full vector of Stokes parameters. We used\ndata obtained with the ZIMPOL instrument at the IRSOL and compared the\nobservations with the theoretical profiles computed with the PORTA radiative\ntransfer code, using as solar model atmosphere a 3D snapshot taken from a\nradiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulation. The synthetic profiles were degraded\nto match the instrument and observing conditions. The degraded theoretical\nprofiles of the Ca 8542 line are qualitatively similar to the observed ones. We\nconfirm that there is a fundamental difference in the widths of all Stokes\nprofiles: the observed lines are wider than the theoretical lines. We find that\nthe amplitudes of the observed profiles are larger than those of the\ntheoretical ones, which suggests that the symmetry breaking effects in the\nsolar chromosphere are stronger than in the model atmosphere. This means that\nthe isosurfaces of temperature, velocity, and magnetic field strength and\norientation are more corrugated in the solar chromosphere than in the currently\navailable 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

Such a diversity originates from (1) the level of viscous\ntransport in the disk which determines the number of gaps a planet can open;\n(2) the size and spatial distributions of grains determined by the coagulation,\nfragmentation, and radial drift, which in turn affects the emmisivity of the\ndisk at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths; and (3) the angular resolution used to\nobserve the disk.

To date, most existing work have studied the EAD\napplication from an ego-vehicle perspective (Ego-EAD) using\nVehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, while relatively limited\nresearch takes into account cooperation among vehicles at intersections via\nVehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication.

Instead of\nconsidering CAVs traveling through signalized intersections one at a time, our\napproach strategically coordinates CAVs' maneuvers to form clusters using\nvarious operating modes: initial vehicle clustering, intra-cluster sequence\noptimization, and cluster formation control. The novel Coop-EAD algorithm is\napplied to the cluster leader, and CAVs in the cluster follow the cluster\nleader to conduct EAD maneuvers. A preliminary simulation study with a given\nscenario shows that, compared to an Ego-EAD application, the proposed Coop-EAD\napplication achieves 11% reduction on energy consumption, up to 19.9% reduction\non pollutant emissions, and 50% increase on traffic throughput, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

For this reason, there is interest\nin creating differentially private versions of them. However, their conversion\nto differentially private algorithms is often naive. For instance, a fixed\nnumber of iterations are chosen, the privacy budget is split evenly among them,\nand at each iteration, parameters are updated with a noisy gradient. In this\npaper, we show that gradient-based algorithms can be improved by a more careful\nallocation of privacy budget per iteration. Intuitively, at the beginning of\nthe optimization, gradients are expected to be large, so that they do not need\nto be measured as accurately. However, as the parameters approach their optimal\nvalues, the gradients decrease and hence need to be measured more accurately.\nWe add a basic line-search capability that helps the algorithm decide when more\naccurate gradient measurements are necessary. Our gradient descent algorithm\nworks with the recently introduced zCDP version of differential privacy.

The relevant field theories in four dimensions are N=1 quiver gauge\ntheories with SU(3) and SU(4) gauge groups respectively. The defects are\nengineered by giving space-time dependent vacuum expectation values to baryonic\noperators. We find evidence that in the case of SU(3) minimal conformal matter\nthe defects carry SU(2) flavor symmetry which is not a symmetry of the four\ndimensional model. The simplest case of a model in this class is SU(3) SQCD\nwith nine flavors and thus the results suggest that this admits natural surface\ndefects with SU(2) flavor symmetry. We analyze the defects using the\nsuperconformal index and derive analytic difference operators introducing the\ndefects into the index computation. The duality properties of the four\ndimensional theories imply that the index of the models is a kernel function\nfor such difference operators.

Yet, most of these systems rely on\nthe semantically rich information of RGB images. Deep Learning solutions\napplied to the data of other sensors typically mounted on autonomous cars (e.g.\nlidars or radars) are not explored much. In this paper we propose a novel\nsolution to understand the dynamics of moving vehicles of the scene from only\nlidar information. The main challenge of this problem stems from the fact that\nwe need to disambiguate the proprio-motion of the 'observer' vehicle from that\nof the external 'observed' vehicles. For this purpose, we devise a CNN\narchitecture which at testing time is fed with pairs of consecutive lidar\nscans. However, in order to properly learn the parameters of this network,\nduring training we introduce a series of so-called pretext tasks which also\nleverage on image data. These tasks include semantic information about\nvehicleness and a novel lidar-flow feature which combines standard image-based\noptical flow with lidar scans. We obtain very promising results and show that\nincluding distilled image information only during training, allows improving\nthe inference results of the network at test time, even when image data is no\nlonger used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 20:27:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 13:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

In the case of iron-based superconductors (IBS), magnetic\nfluctuations presumably play an important role in inducing high temperature\nsuperconductivity. In some cases, these two seemingly incompatible orders\ncoexist microscopically. Therefore, understanding how this unique coexistence\nstate is affected by disorder can provide important information about the\nmicroscopic mechanisms involved. In one of the most studied pnictide family,\nhole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (BaK122), this coexistence occurs over a\nwide range of doping levels, 0.16~$\\lesssim x \\lesssim $~0.25. We used\nrelativistic 2.5 MeV electrons to induce vacancy-interstitial (Frenkel) pairs\nthat act as efficient point-like scattering centers.

In the absence of nodes in the order parameter this provides a\nstrong support for a sign-changing $s_{\\pm}$ pairing. Simultaneously, in the\nnormal state, there is a strong violation of the Matthiessen's rule and a\ndecrease (surprisingly, at the same rate as $T_c$) of the magnetic transition\ntemperature $T_{sm}$, which indicates the itinerant nature of the long-range\nmagnetic order. Comparison of the hole-doped BaK122 with electron-doped\nBa(Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$)$_2$As$_2$ (FeCo122) with similar $T_{sm}\\sim$110~K,\n$x=$0.02, reveals significant differences in the normal states, with no\napparent Matthiessen's rule violation above $T_{sm}$ on the electron-doped\nside.

A complex prior can be designed for\nmulti-channel estimation such as reconstruction and segmentation thanks to\nGauss-Markov-Potts prior model.

The main goal of this work is to study the effect of turbine\nlayout on the power output for large wind farms approaching a fully-developed\nregime. For this purpose we employ an experimental setup of a scaled wind farm\nwith one-hundred porous disk models, of which sixty are instrumented with\nstrain gages. Our experiments cover a parametric space of fifty-six different\nlayouts for which the turbine-area-density is constant, focusing on different\nturbine arrangements including non-uniform spacings. The strain-gage\nmeasurements are used to deduce surrogate power and unsteady loading on\nturbines for each layout. Our results indicate that the power asymptote at the\nend of the wind farm depends on the layout in different ways. Firstly, for\nlayouts with a relatively uniform spacing we find that the power asymptote in\nthe fully developed regime reaches approximately the same value, similarly to\nthe prediction of available analytical models. Secondly, we show that the power\nasymptote in the fully-developed regime can be lowered by inefficient turbine\nplacement, for instance when a large number of the turbines are located in the\nnear wake of upstream turbines. Thirdly, our experiments indicate that an\nuneven spacing between turbines can improve the overall power output for both\nthe developing and fully-developed part of large wind farms. Specifically, we\nfind a higher power asymptote for a turbine layout with a significant\nstreamwise uneven spacing (i.e. a large streamwise spacing between pairs of\nclosely spaced rows that are slightly staggered).

These have many\napplications in time series indexing, clustering, forecasting, regression and\nclassification. One of the key time series classification algorithms, the\nnearest neighbor algorithm with DTW distance (NN-DTW) is very expensive to\ncompute, due to the quadratic complexity of DTW. Lower bound search can speed\nup NN-DTW substantially. An effective and tight lower bound quickly prunes off\nunpromising nearest neighbor candidates from the search space and minimises the\nnumber of the costly DTW computations. The speed up provided by lower bound\nsearch becomes increasingly critical as training set size increases. Different\nlower bounds provide different trade-offs between computation time and\ntightness. Most existing lower bounds interact with DTW warping window sizes.\nThey are very tight and effective at smaller warping window sizes, but become\nlooser as the warping window increases, thus reducing the pruning effectiveness\nfor NN-DTW. In this work, we present a new class of lower bounds that are\ntighter than the popular Keogh lower bound, while requiring similar computation\ntime. Our new lower bounds take advantage of the DTW boundary condition,\nmonotonicity and continuity constraints to create a tighter lower bound. Of\nparticular significance, they remain relatively tight even for large windows. A\nsingle parameter to these new lower bounds controls the speed-tightness\ntrade-off. We demonstrate that these new lower bounds provide an exceptional\nbalance between computation time and tightness for the NN-DTW time series\nclassification task, resulting in greatly improved efficiency for NN-DTW lower\nbound search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 03:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 00:02:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 06:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

Some researches consider a general setup, using\nconditions such as driving ranges for planning. However, most of the EV growths\nin the next decades will happen in the urban area, where driving ranges is not\nthe biggest concern. For such a need, we consider several practical aspects of\nurban systems, such as voltage regulation cost and protection device upgrade\nresulting from the large integration of EVs. Notably, our diversified objective\ncan reveal the trade-off between different factors in different cities\nworldwide. To understand the global optimum of large-scale analysis, we add\nconstraint one-by-one to see how to preserve the problem convexity. Our\nsensitivity analysis before and after convexification shows that our approach\nis not only universally applicable but also has a small approximation error for\nprioritizing the most urgent constraint in a specific setup. Finally, numerical\nresults demonstrate the trade-off, the relationship between different factors\nand the global objective, and the small approximation error. A unique\nobservation in this study shows the importance of incorporating the protection\ndevice upgrade in urban system planning on charging stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 06:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

With the advent of\nincreasingly large image datasets, it has become feasible to incorporate\nquantitative image features into survival prediction. So far, this kind of\nanalysis is mostly based on radiomics features, i.e. a fixed set of features\nthat is mathematically defined a priori. To capture highly abstract\ninformation, it is desirable to learn the feature extraction using\nconvolutional neural networks. However, for tomographic medical images, model\ntraining is difficult because on the one hand, only few samples of 3D image\ndata fit into one batch at once and on the other hand, survival loss functions\nare essentially ordering measures that require large batch sizes. In this work,\nwe show that by simplifying survival analysis to median survival\nclassification, convolutional neural networks can be trained with small batch\nsizes and learn features that predict survival equally well as end-to-end\nhazard prediction networks.

One of our main\nresults is also the statistical interpretation of shocks in a given model at\nwhich the maximal asymmetry measure bound is attained.

Recently, it was\nshown that the presence of additional interactions in the sterile neutrino\nsector via light bosonic mediators can make the scenario cosmologically viable\nby suppressing the production of the sterile neutrinos from active neutrinos\nvia matter-like effect caused by the mediator. This mechanism works assuming\nthe initial population of this sterile sector to be negligible with respect to\nthat of the Standard Model (SM) particles, before the production from active\nneutrinos. However, there is fair chance that such bosonic mediators may couple\nto the inflaton and can be copiously produced during (p)reheating epoch.\nConsequently, they may ruin this assumption of initial small density of the\nsterile sector.

Since it is very\ndifficult to explicitly treat the imaginary-time dependence of the partition\nfunction, we usually neglect the imaginary-time dynamical effect, which is\ncalled the static approximation. Although the static approximation is the first\napproach, it is not even clear when the static approximation is justified for\nmean-field quantum spin systems, that is, mean-field quantum spin systems have\nnot been solved exactly so far. In this study, we solve exactly the partition\nfunction for a particular class of mean-field quantum spin systems including\nrandomness without the static approximation. The partition function can be\nregarded as a result of time evolution in the imaginary-time Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, and solving the exact solution of the partition function is\nequivalent to solving the optimal control problem in the imaginary-time\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. As the result, the solution of the optimal control\nproblem coincides exactly with the static approximate solution of the partition\nfunction and, therefore, the static approximation is exact for the particular\nclass of mean-field quantum spin systems including randomness in general.\nFurthermore, we prove that the analysis of the previous study in quantum\nannealing is exact where the non-stoquastic interaction and the inhomogeneous\ntransverse field accelerate the computational time exponentially for mean-field\nquantum spin systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 09:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

Approaches based on capacitative coupling and\ncavity-mediated interactions effectively couple spin qubits to the charge\ndegree of freedom, making them susceptible to electrically-induced decoherence.\nThe alternative is to extend the range of the Heisenberg exchange interaction\nby means of a quantum mediator. Here, we show that a multielectron quantum dot\nwith 50-100 electrons serves as an excellent mediator, preserving speed and\ncoherence of the resulting spin-spin coupling while providing several\nfunctionalities that are of practical importance. These include speed (mediated\ntwo-qubit rates up to several gigahertz), distance (of order of a micrometer),\nvoltage control, possibility of sweet spot operation (reducing susceptibility\nto charge noise), and reversal of the interaction sign (useful for dynamical\ndecoupling from noise).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 11:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

To be specific, the proposed CDCL\nmethod is an iterative process of three main stages, i.e. twice of RW-based\npseudolabeling and cross domain learning via C-CCA. Firstly, given the\ninitially labeled target samples as training set ($\\mathbf{TS}$), the RW-based\npseudolabeling is employed to update $\\mathbf{TS}$ and extract target clusters\n($\\mathbf{TCs}$) by fusing the segmentation results obtained by RW and extended\nRW (ERW) classifiers.

However, SVM can bring\na significant run time overhead when translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entries\nare missing. Moreover, allowing DMA burst transfers to write SVM traditionally\nrequires buffers to absorb transfers that miss in the TLB. These buffers have\nto be overprovisioned for the maximum burst size, wasting precious on-chip\nmemory, and stall all SVM accesses once they are full, hampering the\nscalability of parallel accelerators.\n  In this work, we present our SVM solution that avoids the majority of TLB\nmisses with prefetching, supports parallel burst DMA transfers without\nadditional buffers, and can be scaled with the workload and number of parallel\nprocessors. Our solution is based on three novel concepts: To minimize the rate\nof TLB misses, the TLB is proactively filled by compiler-generated Prefetching\nHelper Threads, which use run-time information to issue timely prefetches. To\nreduce the latency of TLB misses, misses are handled by a variable number of\nparallel Miss Handling Helper Threads. To support parallel burst DMA transfers\nto SVM without additional buffers, we add lightweight hardware to a standard\nDMA engine to detect and react to TLB misses.

METHOD: To\nunderstand the industrial impact of the proposed methodology, we considered the\n200 most popular OSS Java libraries used by SAP in its own software. Our\nanalysis included 10905 distinct GAVs (group, artifact, version) when\nconsidering all the library versions. RESULTS: We found that about 20% of the\ndependencies affected by a known vulnerability are not deployed, and therefore,\nthey do not represent a danger to the analyzed library because they cannot be\nexploited in practice. Developers of the analyzed libraries are able to fix\n(and actually responsible for) 82% of the deployed vulnerable dependencies. The\nvast majority (81%) of vulnerable dependencies may be fixed by simply updating\nto a new version, while 1% of the vulnerable dependencies in our sample are\nhalted, and therefore, potentially require a costly mitigation strategy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our case study shows that the correct counting allows software\ndevelopment companies to receive actionable information about their library\ndependencies, and therefore, correctly allocate costly development and audit\nresources, which is spent inefficiently in case of distorted measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 12:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

In order to increase the energy or reduce the size of the\naccelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield\nacceleration, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong\nelectric fields, is one such promising novel acceleration technique. Pioneering\nexperiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or electron bunch traversing\na plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are well\nbeyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1\nGV/m. A limitation of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored\nenergy, which motivates the use of multiple stages to reach very high energies.\nThe use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential to drive\nwakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating\nstage. The long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo\nself-modulation, a particle-plasma interaction which longitudinally splits the\nbunch into a series of high density microbunches, which then act resonantly to\ncreate large wakefields. The AWAKE experiment at CERN uses intense bunches of\nprotons, each of energy 400 GeV, with a total bunch energy of 19 kJ, to drive a\nwakefield in a 10 m long plasma. Bunches of electrons are injected into the\nwakefield formed by the proton microbunches. This paper presents measurements\nof electrons accelerated up to 2 GeV at AWAKE. This constitutes the first\ndemonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. The potential for\nthis scheme to produce very high energy electron bunches in a single\naccelerating stage means that the results shown here are a significant step\ntowards the development of future high energy particle accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 12:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 08:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

Lip-reading driven\nspeech enhancement significantly outperforms benchmark audio-only approaches at\nlow signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, at high SNRs or low levels of\nbackground noise, visual cues become fairly less effective for speech\nenhancement. Therefore, a more optimal, context-aware audio-visual (AV) system\nis required, that contextually utilises both visual and noisy audio features\nand effectively accounts for different noisy conditions. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel contextual AV switching component that contextually exploits\nAV cues with respect to different operating conditions to estimate clean audio,\nwithout requiring any SNR estimation. The switching module switches between\nvisual-only (V-only), audio-only (A-only), and both AV cues at low, high and\nmoderate SNR levels, respectively. The contextual AV switching component is\ndeveloped by integrating a convolutional neural network and long-short-term\nmemory network. For testing, the estimated clean audio features are utilised by\nthe developed novel enhanced visually derived Wiener filter for clean audio\npower spectrum estimation. The contextual AV speech enhancement method is\nevaluated under real-world scenarios using benchmark Grid and ChiME3 corpora.\nFor objective testing, perceptual evaluation of speech quality is used to\nevaluate the quality of the restored speech. For subjective testing, the\nstandard mean-opinion-score method is used. The critical analysis and\ncomparative study demonstrate the outperformance of proposed contextual AV\napproach, over A-only, V-only, spectral subtraction, and log-minimum mean\nsquare error based speech enhancement methods at both low and high SNRs,\nrevealing its capability to tackle spectro-temporal variation in any real-world\nnoisy condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

These estimates neglect\nincome differences within shares, introducing, therefore, a potential source of\nmeasurement error. The aim of this paper is to explore a nuanced alternative to\nestimate income inequality, which leads to a reliable representation of the\nincome distribution within shares.

Multiband observations of the optical\ntransient have identified brightness and spectrum features broadly consistent\nwith theoretical predictions. According to the theoretical model, the optical\nradiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of\nunstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the\nejecta transits from an optically thick state to an optically thin state due to\nits subrelativistic expansion. Hence, we expect that about a day after the\nmerger, the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays start to escape\nfrom the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the\nfeatures of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger,\nincluding the brightness and the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the\ngamma-ray emission. We find that more than $95\\%$ of the radiated gamma-ray\nenergy is carried by photons of $0.2$-$4$ MeV, with a spectrum shaped by the\nnucleosynthesis process and the subrelativistic expansion of the ejecta. Under\nfavorable conditions, a prominent pair annihilation line can be present in the\ngamma-ray spectrum with the energy flux about $3$-$5\\%$ of the total. For a\nmerger event similar to GW170817, the gamma-ray emission attains a peak\nluminosity $\\approx 2\\times 10^{41}$erg s$^{-1}$ at $\\approx 1.2$ day after the\nmerger, and fades by a factor of two in about two days. Such a source will be\ndetectable by Satellite-ETCC if it occurs at a distance $\\leq 12$ Mpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 13:56:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 14:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

This suggests a wide class of\nconformal field theories exhibit a version of fast scrambling. In the present\nwork we study this idea in more detail. We begin by clarifying to what extent\ncorrelators of wavepackets built out of superpositions of primary operators may\nbe used to quantify quantum scrambling. Subject to certain caveats, these\nresults concur with previous work. We then go on to study the contribution of\nintermediate states beyond the Virasoro identity block. We find that at late\ntimes, time-ordered correlators exhibit a familiar decoupling theorem,\nsuppressing the contribution of higher dimension operators. However this is no\nlonger true of the out-of-time-order correlators relevant for the discussion of\nquantum chaos. We compute the contributions of these conformal blocks to the\nrelevant correlators, and find they are able to dominate in many interesting\nlimits.

The present paper shows the kinetic formulation of an\norbit-averaged g-Landau equation in action-angle coordinates, beginning with\nBogoliubox-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. We show that only the g-Landau\nequation can satisfy the anti-normalization condition among existing\napproximated star-cluster kinetic equations if gravitational polarization is\nneglected. Accordingly, only the equation can correctly define the total energy\nand the total number of stars in phase space. It also holds the conservation\nlaws and the H-theorem. We further show that stars undergoing the discreteness\nstochastic acceleration can hold these physical properties independently of\nstars experiencing the two-body relaxation. Lastly, we suggest that the\nstochastic acceleration tends to isotropize the stellar DF and to drive star\nclusters into a stationary state in the early relaxation-evolution stage before\nthe two-body relaxation thermalizes stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 15:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 02:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 06:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

It can be considered a metric analogue of the probabilistic\npowerdomain.\n  The spaces we consider, which we call L-ordered, are spaces where the order\nsatisfies a mild compatibility condition with the metric itself, rather than\nmerely with the underlying topology.

Considering the\ncategory of L-ordered metric spaces as a locally posetal 2-category, the lax\nand oplax algebra morphisms are exactly the concave and convex short maps,\nrespectively.\n  In the unordered case, we had identified the Wasserstein space as the colimit\nof the spaces of empirical distributions of finite sequences.

Given insufficient\ndata, while many techniques have been developed to help combat overfitting, the\nchallenge remains if one tries to train deep networks, especially in the\nill-posed extremely low data regimes: only a small set of labeled data are\navailable, and nothing -- including unlabeled data -- else. Such regimes arise\nfrom practical situations where not only data labeling but also data collection\nitself is expensive. We propose a deep adversarial data augmentation (DADA)\ntechnique to address the problem, in which we elaborately formulate data\naugmentation as a problem of training a class-conditional and supervised\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN). Specifically, a new discriminator loss is\nproposed to fit the goal of data augmentation, through which both real and\naugmented samples are enforced to contribute to and be consistent in finding\nthe decision boundaries. Tailored training techniques are developed\naccordingly. To quantitatively validate its effectiveness, we first perform\nextensive simulations to show that DADA substantially outperforms both\ntraditional data augmentation and a few GAN-based options. We then extend\nexperiments to three real-world small labeled datasets where existing data\naugmentation and/or transfer learning strategies are either less effective or\ninfeasible.

Probabilistic\nstate-of-the-art hydrological ensemble prediction models are usually driven\nwith meteorological ensemble forecasts. Hence, biases and dispersion errors of\nthe meteorological forecasts cascade down to the hydrological predictions and\nadd to the errors of the hydrological models. The systematic parts of these\nerrors can be reduced by applying statistical post-processing. For a sound\nestimation of predictive uncertainty and an optimal correction of systematic\nerrors, statistical post-processing methods should be tailored to the\nparticular forecast variable at hand. Former studies have shown that it can\nmake sense to treat hydrological quantities as bounded variables. In this\npaper, a doubly truncated Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method, which allows\nfor flexible post-processing of (multi-model) ensemble forecasts of water\nlevel, is introduced.

Thus, in this article, we consider the challenging issue of\nachieving a certain level of cloud intelligence while reducing network traffic.\nIn order to solve this problem, we design a traffic control algorithm based on\nlabel-less learning on the edge cloud, which is dubbed as LLTC. By the use of\nthe limited computing and storage resources at edge cloud, LLTC evaluates the\nvalue of data, which will be offloaded.

The research mostly focuses on synthesis of systems\ndealing with Boolean signals.

One\nstep closer to real-life systems are register transducers: they can store\ndata-input into registers and later output the content of a register, but they\ndo not directly depend on the data-input, only on its comparison with the\nregisters. Previously it was proven that synthesis of register transducers from\nregister automata is undecidable, but there the authors considered transducers\nequipped with the unbounded queue of registers. First, we prove the problem\nbecomes decidable if bound the number of registers in transducers, by reducing\nthe problem to standard synthesis of Boolean systems.

This requires the\ndevelopment of advanced (typically model-based) techniques for the analysis and\ncontroller design of power networks. Although there are widely accepted\nreduced-order models to describe the dynamic behavior of power networks, they\nare commonly presented without details about the reduction procedure, hampering\nthe understanding of the physical phenomena behind them. The present paper aims\nto provide a modular model derivation of multi-machine power networks. Starting\nfrom first-principle fundamental physics, we present detailed dynamical models\nof synchronous machines and clearly state the underlying assumptions which lead\nto some of the standard reduced-order multi-machine models, including the\nclassical second-order swing equations. In addition, the energy functions for\nthe reduced-order multi-machine models are derived, which allows to represent\nthe multi-machine systems as port-Hamiltonian systems. Moreover, the systems\nare proven to be passive with respect to its steady states, which permits for a\npower-preserving interconnection with other passive components, including\npassive controllers. As a result, the corresponding energy function or\nHamiltonian can be used to provide a rigorous stability analysis of advanced\nmodels for the power network without having to linearize the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 08:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}
