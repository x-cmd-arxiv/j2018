One of the particularly curious aspects\nof this association is its uniqueness to this ocean basin. We show here that\nthis result can be understood as the outcome of an equatorward shift in the\nlocal Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and a moderate reduction of\ntropical vertical shear. These two factors are not necessarily concomitant. The\nmagnitude of the vertical shear change is low enough to suggest that the\nprimary physical mechanism behind this inverse relationship is the equatorward\nshift in the ITCZ. Since a significant proportion of tropical cyclone genesis\nresults from aggregated convective cells forming into a coherent convective\nvortex and being shed from the ITCZ, this shift is apparently sufficient to\nexplain the observed association. The equatorward shift in the ITCZ is\npotentially the result of a relative warming of the Southern Hemisphere in the\nboreal tropical cyclone season. This more equatorward ITCZ, located over warmer\nsurface waters, presumably explains the more intense Hadley circulation,\ndespite a reduction of the large-scale boreal meridional temperature gradient.\nAlthough, these links require further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

Learned composition modules\nrecursively combine constituent spans, culminating in a grounding for the\ncomplete sentence which answers the question.

In particular, the limit\nin which the mass goes to zero lies at infinite distance in field space, and\nthis distance is correlated with a tower of modes becoming light according to\nthe Swampland Distance Conjecture. Application of Tower or Sublattice variants\nof the Weak Gravity Conjecture makes this statement more precise: for a spin-1\nvector boson with coupling constant $e$ and St\\\"uckelberg mass $m$, local\nquantum field theory breaks down at energies at or below $\\Lambda_{\\rm UV} =\n\\min((m M_{\\rm Pl}/e)^{1/2}, e^{1/3} M_{\\rm Pl})$.

Thus, computing the rates and/or the LW flux from a galaxy is no\nlonger necessary to identify neighbouring sites of DCBH formation, as our\nrelation allows one to distinguish regions where DCBH formation could be\ntriggered in the vicinity of a galaxy of a given SFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 18:00:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 10:19:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 12:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

Such manifolds arise from reflexive polytopes that\ncan be cut into two parts along K3 slices. Any two half-polytopes over a given\nslice can be combined into a reflexive polytope. This fact, together with a\nremarkable relation on the additivity of Hodge numbers, give to the Hodge plot\nthe appearance of a fractal.

In this paper, we conduct\nan in-depth study on the construction of embedding space for ZSL and posit that\nan ideal embedding space should satisfy two criteria: intra-class compactness\nand inter-class separability. While the former encourages the embeddings of\nvisual samples of one class to distribute tightly close to the semantic\ndescription embedding of this class, the latter requires embeddings from\ndifferent classes to be well separated from each other. Towards this goal, we\npresent a simple but effective two-branch network to simultaneously map\nsemantic descriptions and visual samples into a joint space, on which visual\nembeddings are forced to regress to their class-level semantic embeddings and\nthe embeddings crossing classes are required to be distinguishable by a\ntrainable classifier.

Similarity is often task specific, and pre-defined\ndistances can perform poorly, leading to work in metric learning. However,\nbeing able to learn a similarity-sensitive distance function also presupposes\naccess to a rich, discriminative representation for the objects at hand. In\nthis dissertation we present contributions towards both ends. In the first part\nof the thesis, assuming good representations for the data, we present a\nformulation for metric learning that makes a more direct attempt to optimize\nfor the k-NN accuracy as compared to prior work. We also present extensions of\nthis formulation to metric learning for kNN regression, asymmetric similarity\nlearning and discriminative learning of Hamming distance. In the second part,\nwe consider a situation where we are on a limited computational budget i.e.\noptimizing over a space of possible metrics would be infeasible, but access to\na label aware distance metric is still desirable. We present a simple, and\ncomputationally inexpensive approach for estimating a well motivated metric\nthat relies only on gradient estimates, discussing theoretical and experimental\nresults. In the final part, we address representational issues, considering\ngroup equivariant convolutional neural networks (GCNNs).

To do this, we assume that the tracer densities\nare modeled with power-law and S\\'ersic profiles, and then we solve the\nspherical Jeans equation to estimate the dynamical mass. Applying these models\nto kinematic data of globular clusters in NGC1052-DF2, we compare 90 per cent\nupper limits of dynamical mass-to-light ratios estimated between from this\nanalysis and from vD18. We find that the upper limit obtained by the power-law\nis virtually the same as the result from vD18, whilst this limit estimated by\nthe S\\'ersic is significantly greater than that from vD18, thereby suggesting\nthat NGC1052-DF2 can still be a dark-matter dominated system.

Seven emotional states including moderate and\nintense versions of three emotional families as anger, joy, and sadness, plus a\nneutral state are considered, with speech samples in Mandarin Chinese. The\nglottal waveform extracted from speech samples of different emotion states are\nfirst analyzed in both time domain and frequency domain to discover their\ndifferences. Comparative emotion classifications are then taken out based on\nfeatures extracted from original whole speech signal and only glottal wave\nsignal. In experiments of generation of a performance-driven hierarchical\nclassifier architecture, and pairwise classification on individual emotional\nstates, the low difference between accuracies obtained from speech signal and\nglottal signal proved that a majority of emotional cues in speech could be\nconveyed through glottal waveform. The best distinguishable emotional pair by\nglottal waveform is intense anger against moderate sadness, with the accuracy\nof 92.45%.

Two spatial networks corresponding to the\nstreamwise and wall-normal velocity components are built, where nodes represent\nportions of volume of the physical domain. For each network, links are active\nif the correlation coefficient of the corresponding velocity component between\npairs of nodes is sufficiently high, thus unveiling the strongest kinematic\nrelations. Several network measures are studied in order to explore the\ninterrelations between nodes and their neighbors. Specifically, long-range\nlinks are localized between near-wall regions and associated with the temporal\npersistence of coherent patterns, namely high and low speed streaks.\nFurthermore, long-range links play a crucial role as intermediary for the\nkinematic information flow, as emerges from the analysis of indirect\nconnections between nodes. The proposed approach provides a framework to\ninvestigate spatial structures of the turbulent dynamics, showing the full\npotential of complex networks. Although the network analysis is based on the\ntwo-point correlation, it is able to advance the level of information, by\nexploiting the texture created by active links in all directions.

The states at the maximum of the energy barrier represent a\nsubcritical branch of unstable stationary points, which are the transition\nstates to a snap-through buckled state. Starting from nonlinear shallow shell\ntheory we obtain a closed analytical expression for the energy barrier height,\nwhich facilitates its effective numerical evaluation as a function of pressure\nby continuation techniques. We find a clear crossover between two regimes: For\n$p/p_c\\ll 1$ the post-buckling barrier state is a mirror-inverted Pogorelov\ndimple, and for $(1-p/p_c)\\ll 1$ the barrier state is a shallow dimple with\nindentations smaller than shell thickness and exhibits extended oscillations,\nwhich are well described by linear response.

Methods:\nHighly-spectrally-resolved Z-spectra from the same volunteer were acquired by\n3D-snapshot CEST MRI at 3 T and 9.4 T with similar saturation schemes. The\nvolume-registered 3 T Z-spectra-stack was then used as input data for a 3-layer\ndeep neural network with the volume-registered 9.4 T fitted parameter stack as\ntarget data.

Then, two\nchaotic maps are used to generate two key streams which are permuted among\nthemselves to produce one key steam. The image blocks are then shuffled using\npart of key stream. Finally, scrambled image is diffused by XOR operation with\nthe key stream to get the encrypted image. The experimental results of several\nperformance analyses about the pixel correlation, various statistical analysis,\ninformation entropy analysis, differential analysis, the key space and key\nsensitivity analysis, show that the algorithm can resist several know attacks\neffectively and has the advantages of large key space, high security, and high\nspeed, assuring safety performance and secure image encryption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 09:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

Due to coupled interference of wireless transmission and\ntransaction fee incurred from blockchain's distributed ledger services,\nrational sensors have to decide on their transmission rates to maximize\nindividual utility. Thus, we formulate a noncooperative game model to analyze\nthis competitive situation among the sensors. We provide the analytical\ncondition for the existence of the Nash equilibrium as well as a series of\ninsightful numerical results about the equilibrium strategies in the game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 10:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

Here, to address this problem, we introduce a rotationally\ninvariant system-bath (RISB) model that is described by two sets of\nharmonic-oscillator baths independently coupled to the rigid rotator as sine\nand cosine functions of the rotator angle. Due to a difference in the energy\ndiscretization of the total Hamiltonian, the dynamics described by the RISB\nmodel differ significantly from those described by the rotational\nCaldeira-Legget (RCL) model, while both models reduce to the Langevin equation\nfor a rotator in the classical limit. To demonstrate this point, we compute the\nrotational absorption spectrum defined by the linear response function of a\nrotator dipole. For this purpose, we derive a quantum master equation for the\nRISB model in the high-temperature Markovian case.

In the weak-coupling limit, such a system can be associated with\na unique dual physical system in which all energies are inverted, in particular\nthe internal interaction. This paper generalizes this fermionic duality in two\nways: we allow for weak coupling with arbitrary energy dependence and describe\nboth occupations and coherences coupled by a quantum master equation for the\ndensity operator. We also show that whenever generalized detailed balance holds\n(Kolmogorov criterion), the stationary probabilities for the dual system can be\nexpressed explicitly in terms of the stationary recurrence times of the\noriginal system, even at large bias.\n  We illustrate the generalized duality by a detailed analysis of the rate\nequation for a quantum dot with strong onsite Coulomb repulsion, going beyond\nthe commonly assumed wideband limit.

Although large\ncarbon-bearing molecules have been proposed as the carriers producing DIBs,\ntheir identity remains unknown. The sight line to the young massive\nstar-forming region M17 shows anomalous extinction in the sense that the\ntotal-to-selective extinction parameter differs significantly from the average\nGalactic value and may reach values $R_{V} > 4$. Given the high $R_V$ values,\nwe investigate whether the DIBs in sight lines towards young OB stars in M17\nshow a peculiar behaviour. We measure the properties of the most prominent DIBs\nin M17 and study these as a function of $E(B-V)$ and $R_{V}$. The DIB strengths\nin M17 concur with the observed relations between DIB equivalent width and\nreddening $E(B-V)$ in Galactic sight lines. For several DIBs we discover a\nlinear relation between the normalised DIB strength EW/$A_{V}$ and\n$R_{V}^{-1}$. These trends suggest two groups: (i) a group of ten moderately\nstrong DIBs that show a sensitivity to changes in $R_{V}$ that is modest and\nproportional to DIB strength, and (ii) a group of four very strong DIBs that\nreact sensitively and to a similar degree to changes in $R_{V}$, but in a way\nthat does not appear to depend on DIB strength. The DIB behaviour as a function\nof reddening is not peculiar in sight lines to M17. Also, we do not detect\nanomalous DIB profiles as seen in Her 36. DIBs are stronger, per unit visual\nextinction, in sight lines characterised by a smaller value of $R_{V}$ (large\nfraction of small dust particles). New relations between extinction normalised\nDIB strengths, EW/$A_V$, and $R_V$ support the idea that DIB carriers and\ninterstellar dust are connected. Given the distinct behaviour of two groups of\nDIBs, different types of carriers do not necessarily relate to the dust grains\nin a similar way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 11:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

We also\nfind that the WSG potential with the almost same parameters determined for\n$^{212}$Po (except for a rescaled radius) could also be used to describe\nalpha-cluster structures in $^{20}\\text{Ne}={}^{16}\\text{O}+\\alpha$ and\n$^{44}\\text{Ti}={}^{40}\\text{Ca}+\\alpha$. In all three cases, the calculated\nvalues of the level schemes, electromagnetic transitions, and alpha-decay\nhalf-lives agree with the experimental data, which shows that the WSG potential\ncould indeed grasp many important features of the alpha-cluster structures in\nalpha+closed shell nuclei. The study here is a useful complement to the\nexisting cluster-core potentials in literature. The Gaussian form factor\ncentered at the nuclear surface might also help deepen our understanding on the\nalpha-cluster formation taking place around the same place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 11:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

This is\nequivalent to deciding whether the uncertainty set is contained within the\nprojection of the feasible region onto the uncertainty-space. Moreover, the\nconsidered sets are assumed to be described by polynomials. For answering this\nquestion, two very general approaches using methods from polynomial\noptimization are presented - one for showing feasibility and one for showing\ninfeasibility. The developed methods are approximated through sum of squares\npolynomials and solved using semidefinite programs. Deciding robust feasibility\nand infeasibility is important for gas network operations, which is a nonconvex\nfeasibility problem where the feasible set is described by a composition of\npolynomials with the absolute value function. Concerning the gas network\nproblem, different topologies are considered.

In the present article, we study an\nimportant point in more detail, the 'definition' of 'powers'\n('$\\delta\\upsilon\\nu\\acute\\alpha\\mu\\epsilon\\iota\\varsigma$'). While in\n[Brisson-Ofman2], it was shown that the different steps to get the definition\nare mathematically and philosophically incorrect, it is explained why the\ndefinition itself is problematic. However, it is the first example, at least in\nthe trilogy, of a definition by division. This point is generally ignored by\nmodern commentators though, as we will try to show, it gives rise, in a\nmathematical context, to at least three fundamental questions: the meaning(s)\nof 'logos', the connection between 'elements and compound' and, of course the\nquestion of the 'power(s)'. One of the main consequences of our works on\nTheaetetus' 'mathematical passage', including the present one, is to challenge\nthe so-called 'main standard interpretation'. In particular, following\n[Ofman2014], we question the claim that Plato praises and glorifies both the\nmathematician Theodorus and the young Theaetetus. According to our analysis,\nsuch a claim, considered as self-evident, entails many errors. Conversely, our\nanalysis of Theaetetus' mathematical mistakes highlights the main cause of some\ngenerally overlooked failures in the dialogue: the forgetting of the 'logos',\nfirst in the 'mathematical part', then in the following discussion, and finally\nthe failure of the four successive tries of its definition at the end of the\ndialogue. Namely, as we will show, the passage is closely connected with the\nproblems studied at the end of the dialogue, but also to the two other parts of\nthe trilogy through the method of 'definition by division'. Finally, if our\nconclusions are different from the usual ones, it is probably because the\npassage is analyzed, maybe for the first time, simultaneously from the\nphilosophical, historical and mathematical points of view. It had been\nconsidered usually either as an excursus by historians of philosophy (for\ninstance [Burnyeat1978]), or as an isolated text separated from the rest of the\ndialogue by historians of mathematics (for instance [Knorr1975]), or lastly as\na pretext to discuss some astute developments in modern mathematics by\nmathematicians (for instance [Kahane1985]).[Brisson-Ofman1]: Luc\nBrisson-Salomon Ofman, `Theodorus' lesson in Plato's Theaetetus(147d3-d6)\nRevisited-A New Perspective', to appear[Brisson-Ofman2]: Luc Brisson-Salomon\nOfman, `The Philosophical Interpretation of Plato'sTheaetetus and the Final\nPart of the Mathematical Lesson (147d7-148b)', to appear[Burnyeat 1978]: Myles\nBurnyeat, `The Philosophical Sense of Theaetetus' Mathematics',Isis, 69, 1978,\n489-514[Kahane1985]: Jean-Pierre Kahane, `la th{\\'e}orie de Th{\\'e}odore des\ncorps quadratiques r{\\'e}els',L'enseignement math{\\'e}matique, 31, 1985, p.\n85-92[Knorr1975]: Wilbur Knorr, The evolution of the Euclidean elements,\nReidel, 1975[Ofman2014]: Salomon Ofman, `Comprendre les math{\\'e}matiques pour\ncomprendre Platon-Th{\\'e}{\\'e}t{\\`e}te (147d-148b)', Lato Sensu, I, 2014, p.\n70-80\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 13:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

A system is self-stabilizing if it can recover\nto a legitimate state from any initial illegal state. These kind of systems are\nmost often used in distributed applications. Monotonic searchability provides\nguarantees when searching for nodes while the recovery process is going on.\nMore precisely, if a search request started at some node $u$ succeeds in\nreaching its destination $v$, then all future search requests from $u$ to $v$\nsucceed as well. Although there already exists a self-stabilizing protocol for\na two-dimensional topology and an universal approach for monotonic\nsearchability, it is not clear how both of these concepts fit together\neffectively.

As such, they have become increasingly prevalent in many real\nworld applications including those where security is of great concern. Such\npopularity, however, may attract attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities of\nthe deployed deep learning models and launch attacks against security-sensitive\napplications. In this paper, we focus on a specific type of data poisoning\nattack, which we refer to as a {\\em backdoor injection attack}. The main goal\nof the adversary performing such attack is to generate and inject a backdoor\ninto a deep learning model that can be triggered to recognize certain embedded\npatterns with a target label of the attacker's choice. Additionally, a backdoor\ninjection attack should occur in a stealthy manner, without undermining the\nefficacy of the victim model. Specifically, we propose two approaches for\ngenerating a backdoor that is hardly perceptible yet effective in poisoning the\nmodel. We consider two attack settings, with backdoor injection carried out\neither before model training or during model updating.

For low arboricity graphs, which include, for example, minor-free\ngraphs as well as some classes of `real world' graphs, our update time is\npolylogarithmic.

This covers much of the range of possible values for\narboricity, as the arboricity of a general graph cannot exceed $m^{1/2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

For this purpose, we use four species of common bacteria in reference\nto human health and safety including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,\nStaphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The choice of these\nfour bacteria also allows us to check for effects which rely upon the\nGram-staining properties or shapes of bacterial species. These species were\ninitially exposed to static, non-homogeneous and alternating weak magnetic\nfields, and then they were grown in incubators in the same environment at 37\n{\\deg}C simultaneously. Comparative measurements of optical density are then\nused to track the sustained impact on bacterial growth in the experimental\nsamples. Bacteria was first grown in different weak magnetic fields on a plain\nglass surface both in liquid and solid media.

Under periodic boundary conditions\nestablished algorithms are available for doing this, however, at the expense of\nrestricting the way in which the gels can deform in an external magnetic field.\nMoreover, the magnetic properties depend on the sample shape, ruling out\nperiodic boundary conditions entirely for some research questions.

In\norder to provide a better fit to the target data distribution when the dataset\nincludes many different classes, we propose a variant of the basic GAN model,\ncalled Gaussian Mixture GAN (GM-GAN), where the probability distribution over\nthe latent space is a mixture of Gaussians. We also propose a supervised\nvariant which is capable of conditional sample synthesis. In order to evaluate\nthe model's performance, we propose a new scoring method which separately takes\ninto account two (typically conflicting) measures - diversity vs. quality of\nthe generated data. Through a series of empirical experiments, using both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets, we quantitatively show that GM-GANs\noutperform baselines, both when evaluated using the commonly used Inception\nScore, and when evaluated using our own alternative scoring method. In\naddition, we qualitatively demonstrate how the \\textit{unsupervised} variant of\nGM-GAN tends to map latent vectors sampled from different Gaussians in the\nlatent space to samples of different classes in the data space. We show how\nthis phenomenon can be exploited for the task of unsupervised clustering, and\nprovide quantitative evaluation showing the superiority of our method for the\nunsupervised clustering of image datasets. Finally, we demonstrate a feature\nwhich further sets our model apart from other GAN models: the option to control\nthe quality-diversity trade-off by altering, post-training, the probability\ndistribution of the latent space. This allows one to sample higher quality and\nlower diversity samples, or vice versa, according to one's needs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

We use an off-lattice cellular\nautomaton framework to model the individual behavior of cells within the SC.\nThe movement of cells and the ability to reproduce is determined by the\nnutrient profile and local porosity. A phenomenological approach is used to\ncapture a continuous profile for SC and ECM evolution, which will then change\nthe local porosity.

In this game, the soldier seeks to\naccomplish a time-critical mission by traversing a battlefield within a certain\namount of time, while maintaining its connectivity with an IoBT network. The\nattacker, on the other hand, seeks to find the optimal opportunity to\ncompromise the IoBT network and maximize the delay of the soldier's IoBT\ntransmission link. The soldier and the attacker's psychological behavior are\ncaptured using tools from psychological game theory, with which the soldier's\nand attacker's intentions to harm one another are considered in their\nutilities. To solve this game, a novel learning algorithm based on Bayesian\nupdating is proposed to find a $\\epsilon$-like psychological self-confirming\nequilibrium of the game.

Despite extensive\nstudies on quasi-brittle failure, there still lacks a unified framework that\ncan quantify the interdependent evolution of robustness, damage and force\ntransmission. Here we develop a framework to do so. It is data-driven,\nmultiscale and relies solely on the contact strengths and topology of the\ncontact network for material properties. Using data derived from discrete\nelement simulations of concrete specimens under uniaxial tension, we uncover\nevidence of an optimized force transmission, characterized by two novel\ntransmission patterns that predict and explain damage propagation from the\nmicrostructural to the macroscopic level. The first comprises the optimized\nflow routes: shortest possible paths that can transmit the global transmission\ncapacity. These paths reliably predict tensile force chains. The second are the\nforce bottlenecks. These provide an early and accurate prediction of the\nultimate pattern, location and interaction of macrocracks. A two-pronged\ncooperative mechanism among bottlenecks, enabled by redundancies in\ntransmission pathways, underlies robustness in the pre-failure regime.\nBottlenecks take turns in accommodating damage, while member contacts spread\nthe forces to confine damage to low capacity contacts which leave behind a web\nof strong contacts to support and curtail the failure of tensile force chains\nin the region. This cooperative behavior, while serving to minimize the\ninevitable reduction in global transmission capacity, progressively heightens\nthe interdependency among these contacts and elicits the opposite effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 00:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

An\nexplicit example of a square-periodic network of beams with a single isolated\nresonant beam within a periodicity cell is considered in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 18:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

The\nproposed switch may receive energy from one or multiple power sources in the\nform of energy packets, store them and aggregate the contained energy, and\nforward the accumulated energy to requesting loads connected to one or multiple\noutput ports of the switch. Energy packets are discrete amounts of energy that\nare associated in- or out-of-band with an address and other metadata. Loads\nreceive these discrete amounts of finely-controlled energy rather than\ndiscretionary amounts after. The control and management of the proposed switch\nare based on a request-grant protocol. Using energy packets helps to manage the\ndelivery of power in a reliable, robust, and function form that may enable\nfeatures not yet available in the present power grid. The switch, as any\nelement of a digital grid, uses a data network for the transmission of these\nrequests and grants. The energy packet switch may be the centerpiece for\ncreating infrastructure in the realization of the digital power grid. The\ndesign of the energy packet switch is based on shared supercapacitors to shape\nand manage discretization of energy. We introduce the design and analysis of\nthe electrical properties of the proposed switch and describe the procedure\nused in the switch to determine the amount of energy transmitted to requesting\nloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 04:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

An important consideration of the value of Petri nets\nis their use in describing both the syntax and semantics of modeling\nformalisms. Describing a modeling notation in terms of a formal technique such\nas Petri nets provides a way to minimize ambiguity. Accordingly, it is\nimperative to develop a deep and diverse understanding of Petri nets. This\npaper is directed toward a new, but preliminary, exploration of the semantics\nof such an important tool. Specifically, the concern in this paper is with the\nsemantics of Petri nets interpreted in a modeling language based on the notion\nof machines of things that flow. The semantics of several Petri net diagrams\nare analyzed in terms of flow of things. The results point to the viability of\nthe approach for exploring the underlying assumptions of Petri nets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 21:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}
