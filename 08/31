In this work we take advantage of the LOFAR\nMultifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) to investigate such spectra for a\nlarge sample of nearby star-forming galaxies. Using the measured 150MHz flux\ndensities from the LOFAR MSSS survey and literature flux densities at various\nfrequencies we have obtained integrated radio spectra for 106 galaxies. The\nspectra are explained through the use of a three-dimensional model of galaxy\nradio emission, and radiation transfer dependent on the galaxy viewing angle\nand absorption processes. Spectra of our galaxies are generally flatter at\nlower compared to higher frequencies but as there is no tendency for the highly\ninclined galaxies to have more flattened low-frequency spectra, we argue that\nthe observed flattening is not due to thermal absorption, contradicting the\nsuggestion of Israel & Mahoney (1990). According to our modelled radio maps for\nM51-like galaxies, the free-free absorption effects can be seen only below\n30MHz and in the global spectra just below 20MHz, while in the spectra of\nstarburst galaxies, like M82, the flattening due to absorption is instead\nvisible up to higher frequencies of about 150MHz. Locally, within galactic\ndisks, the absorption effects are distinctly visible in M51-like galaxies as\nspectral flattening around 100-200MHz in the face-on objects, and as turnovers\nin the edge-on ones, while in M82-like galaxies there are strong turnovers at\nfrequencies above 700MHz, regardless of viewing angle. Our modelling suggests\nthat the weak spectral flattening observed in the nearby galaxies studied here\nresults principally from synchrotron spectral curvature due to cosmic ray\nenergy losses and propagation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 16:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 09:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid Vesta have been studied by\nthe Dawn space mission. They are the two heaviest bodies of the main asteroid\nbelt and have different characteristics.

The aim of this paper is to determine the obliquity variations of Ceres\nand Vesta and to study their rotational stability.\n  Methods. The orbital and rotational motions have been integrated by\nsymplectic integration. The rotational stability has been studied by\nintegrating secular equations and by computing the diffusion of the precession\nfrequency.\n  Results. The obliquity variations of Ceres over $[-20:0]\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ are\nbetween $2$ and $20{\\deg}$ and the obliquity variations of Vesta are between\n$21$ and $45{\\deg}$.

These challenges have restricted the treatment of\nAuger recombination to simple, noninteracting electron-hole models.

We did not find any counterpart\nfor the selected fourteen new HAWC sources from our analysis of Fermi-LAT data\nfor energies higher than 10 GeV. During the search, we detected GeV gamma-ray\nemission coincident with a known TeV pulsar wind nebula, SNR G54.1+0.3 (VER\nJ1930+188), and a 2HWC source, 2HWC J1930+188. The fluxes for isolated, steady\nsources in the 2HWC catalog are generally in good agreement with those measured\nby imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. However, the VERITAS fluxes for\nSNR G54.1+0.3, DA 495, and TeV J2032+4130 are lower than those measured by HAWC\nand several new HAWC sources are not detected by VERITAS. This is likely due to\na change in spectral shape, source extension, or the influence of diffuse\nemission in the source region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 17:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

Analytical solutions are obtained for both second order nonlinear\ndispersive chain and homogenous harmonic chain. Solution was also compared with\nnumerical results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Locally dominant\nphonon modes (k-space) are introduced based on these solutions. These locally\ndefined phonon modes k(x,t) spatially and temporally varying with x and t are\ncritical to the establishment of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The\nestablishment of LTE should require a uniform distribution of energy in these\nmodes at any given time t and location x. Wave propagation accompanying with\nthe nonequilibrium dynamics leads to the excitation of these locally defined\nphonon modes. It was found that the system energy is redistributed among these\nexcited phonons modes (k-space). This redistribution process is only possible\nwith nonlinear dispersion and requires a finite amount of time to achieve a\nsteady state distribution depending on the spatial distribution (or frequency\ncontent) of initial perturbation and the dispersion relation, where sharper and\nconcentrated perturbation leads to a faster redistribution. Ballistic type of\nheat transport along the harmonic chain reveals that at any given position the\nlowest mode (k=0) is excited first and gradually expanding to the highest mode,\nwhich can only asymptotically approach the maximum mode of the first Brillouin\nzone. Energy is shown to be uniformly distributed in all available phonon modes\nlower than the highest mode. The energy flux along the chain is shown to be a\nconstant with time and proportional to the sound speed (ballistic transport).\nComparison with the Fourier's law leads to a time-dependent thermal\nconductivity that diverges with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 17:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

However,\ncompelling evidence for the presence of heavier third-peak r-process elements\n(e.g., gold, platinum) or translead nuclei remains elusive. At early times\n(~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble\nof beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense,\ngenerating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single\npower-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input\ncan possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays, 223Ra\n(half-life t_{1/2}=11.43d), 225Ac (t_{1/2}=10.0d, following the beta-decay of\n225Ra with t_{1/2}=14.9d), and the fissioning isotope 254Cf (t_{1/2}=60.5d),\nwhich liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency\nthan beta-decay products. Late-time nebular observations of kilonovae which\nconstrain the radioactive power provide the potential to identify signatures of\nthese individual isotopes, thus confirming the production of heavy nuclei.

In addition, by comparing the nuclear heating rate\nobtained with an abundance distribution following the Solar r abundance\npattern, to the bolometric lightcurve of AT2017gfo, we find that the\nyet-uncertain r abundance of 72Ge plays a decisive role in powering the\nlightcurve, if one assumes that GW170817 has produced a full range of the Solar\nr abundances down to A~70.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 05:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

The probability of\nestablishing a LOS link is investigated and the probability density function\n(PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a randomly-oriented device is derived.\nBy means of the PDF of SNR, the bit-error ratio (BER) of DC-biased optical\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) in additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) channels is evaluated. A closed-form approximation for\nthe BER of UE with random orientation is presented which shows a good match\nwith Monte-Carlo simulation results.

We show that strict global\nconstraints of anisotropic nature occur in the limit of vanishing layer\nthickness, and give a characterization of the class of effective deformations.\nThe optimality of the scaling relation between layer thickness and stiffness is\nconfirmed by suitable bending constructions. Beyond its theoretical interest,\nthis result constitutes a key ingredient for the homogenization of variational\nproblems modeling high-contrast bilayered composite materials, where the common\nassumption of strict inclusion of one phase in the other is clearly not\nsatisfied. We study a model inspired by hyperelasticity via Gamma-convergence,\nfor which we are able to give an explicit representation of the homogenized\nlimit problem.

Functional side channels arise when an attacker\nknows that a secret value of a server stays fixed for a certain time. Then, the\nattacker can observe the server executions on a sequence of different public\ninputs, each paired with the same secret input. Thus for each secret, the\nattacker observes a function from public inputs to execution time, for\ninstance, and she can compare these functions for different secrets. First, we\nintroduce a notion of noninterference for functional side channels. We focus on\nthe case of noisy observations, where we demonstrate with examples that there\nis a practical functional side channel in programs that would be deemed\ninformation-leak-free or be underestimated using the standard definition.\nSecond, we develop a framework and techniques for debugging programs for\nfunctional side channels.

Interest in\nthese maps arises from the fact that iterating a quantum t-tensor product\nexpander gives us a unitary t-design, which has many applications to quantum\ncomputation and information. We show that the zigzag product of a high\ndimensional quantum expander (i.e. t = 1) of moderate degree with a moderate\ndimensional quantum t-tensor product expander of low degree gives us a high\ndimensional quantum t-tensor product expander of low degree.

With the ability to compute the\nnonlocal nuclear density from ab initio wave functions, it is now possible to\nestimate effects of such spurious contributions. Purpose: We derive the kinetic\ndensity using ab initio nonlocal scalar one-body nuclear densities computed\nwithin the no-core shell model (NCSM) approach, utilizing two- and\nthree-nucleon chiral interactions as the sole input. With the ability to\ncompute translationally invariant nonlocal densities, it is possible to\ndirectly gauge the impact of the spurious center-of-mass (COM) contributions in\nDFT quantities such as the kinetic density. Methods: The nonlocal nuclear\ndensities are derived from the NCSM one-body densities calculated in second\nquantization.

We generalize the Toomre criterion for\nthe stability of disks to tightly wound, axisymmetric perturbations. We apply\nthis to a family of thin exponential disks with different central surface\ndensities. By numerically calculating their QUMOND rotation curves, we obtain\nthe minimum radial velocity dispersion required for stability against local\nself-gravitating collapse.\n  MOND correctly predicts much higher rotation speeds in low surface brightness\ngalaxies (LSBs) than does Newtonian dynamics without dark matter. Newtonian\nmodels thus require putative very massive halos, whose inert nature implies\nthey would strongly stabilize the disk.\n  MOND also increases the stability of galactic disks, but in contradistinction\nto Newtonian gravity, this extra stability is limited to a factor of 2. MOND is\nthus rather more conducive to the formation of bars and spiral arms. Therefore,\nobservation of such features in LSBs could be problematic for Newtonian galaxy\nmodels. This could constitute a crucial discriminating test. We quantitatively\naccount for these facts in QUMOND.\n  We also compare numerical QUMOND rotation curves of thin exponential disks to\nthose predicted by two algebraic expressions commonly used to calculate MOND\nrotation curves. For the choice that best approximates QUMOND, we find the\ncircular velocities agree to within 1.5% beyond $\\approx 0.5$ disk scale\nlengths, regardless of the central surface density.

Often in such problems fairness is also a concern. A natural\nnotion of fairness, based on general principles of equality of opportunity,\nasks that conditional on an individual being a candidate for the resource, the\nprobability of actually receiving it is approximately independent of the\nindividual's group. In lending this means that equally creditworthy individuals\nin different racial groups have roughly equal chances of receiving a loan. In\npolicing it means that two individuals committing the same crime in different\ndistricts would have roughly equal chances of being arrested.\n  We formalize this fairness notion for allocation problems and investigate its\nalgorithmic consequences. Our main technical results include an efficient\nlearning algorithm that converges to an optimal fair allocation even when the\nfrequency of candidates (creditworthy individuals or criminals) in each group\nis unknown. The algorithm operates in a censored feedback model in which only\nthe number of candidates who received the resource in a given allocation can be\nobserved, rather than the true number of candidates. This models the fact that\nwe do not learn the creditworthiness of individuals we do not give loans to nor\nlearn about crimes committed if the police presence in a district is low.\n  As an application of our framework, we consider the predictive policing\nproblem. The learning algorithm is trained on arrest data gathered from its own\ndeployments on previous days, resulting in a potential feedback loop that our\nalgorithm provably overcomes.

This book is\nthe outcome of a joint effort of Belle II collaborators and theorists through\nthe Belle II theory interface platform (B2TiP), an effort that commenced in\n2014. The aim of B2TiP was to elucidate the potential impacts of the Belle II\nprogram, which includes a wide scope of physics topics: B physics, charm, tau,\nquarkonium, electroweak precision measurements and dark sector searches. It is\ncomposed of nine working groups (WGs), which are coordinated by teams of\ntheorist and experimentalists conveners: Semileptonic and leptonic B decays,\nRadiative and Electroweak penguins, phi_1 and phi_2 (time-dependent CP\nviolation) measurements, phi_3 measurements, Charmless hadronic B decay, Charm,\nQuarkonium(like), tau and low-multiplicity processes, new physics and global\nfit analyses. This book highlights \"golden- and silver-channels\", i.e. those\nthat would have the highest potential impact in the field.

The problem can be formulated in a\nreinforcement learning (RL) setup, where a policy-based agent sequentially\nextends its inference path until it reaches a target. However, in an incomplete\nKG environment, the agent receives low-quality rewards corrupted by false\nnegatives in the training data, which harms generalization at test time.\nFurthermore, since no golden action sequence is used for training, the agent\ncan be misled by spurious search trajectories that incidentally lead to the\ncorrect answer. We propose two modeling advances to address both issues: (1) we\nreduce the impact of false negative supervision by adopting a pretrained\none-hop embedding model to estimate the reward of unobserved facts; (2) we\ncounter the sensitivity to spurious paths of on-policy RL by forcing the agent\nto explore a diverse set of paths using randomly generated edge masks.

Motivated by this industry\ntrend, we propose a general framework for designing and optimizing the mobile\ndata plan with time flexibility. Such a framework includes the traditional data\nplan, two existing rollover data plans, and a new credit data plan as special\ncases. Under this framework, we formulate a monopoly MNO's optimal data plan\ndesign as a three-stage Stackelberg game: In Stage I, the MNO decides the data\nmechanism; In Stage II, the MNO further decides the corresponding data cap,\nsubscription fee, and the per-unit fee; Finally in Stage III, users make\nsubscription decisions based on their own characteristics. Through backward\ninduction, we analytically characterize the MNO's profit-maximizing data plan\nand the corresponding users' subscriptions. Furthermore, we conduct a market\nsurvey to estimate the distribution of users' two-dimensional characteristics,\nand evaluate the performance of different data mechanisms using the real data.\nWe find that a more time-flexible data mechanism increases MNO's profit and\nusers' payoffs, hence improves the social welfare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 02:10:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 01:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 01:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

For this reason, many researchers have fabricated\nLBSO epitaxial films thus far, but the obtainable carrier mobility is\nsubstantially low compared to that of single crystals due to the formation of\nthe lattice/structural defects. Here we report that the mobility suppression in\nLBSO films can be lifted by a simple vacuum annealing process. The vacuum\nannealing of the LBSO films on MgO substrate increased the carrier\nconcentrations due to the oxygen vacancy formation, which leads to simultaneous\nlateral grain growth. As a result, the carrier mobility was greatly improved by\nthe vacuum annealing, which does not occur after heat treatment in air. These\nresults expand our current knowledge on the point defect formation in epitaxial\nLBSO films and show that vacuum annealing is a powerful tool for enhancing the\nmobility values of LBSO films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 02:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

This observation is in contrast with what has been\nobserved in water waves when decreasing the water depth, which also changes the\nwaves from dispersive to weakly dispersive. The weak turbulence observed in the\ndeep water case evolves into a solitonic regime. Here no such transition is\nobserved for the stretched plate.

Baryon number violation is\nintroduced in the scalar potential, permitting $\\Delta B=2$ violating process\ninvolving Standard Model quarks while avoiding stringent proton decay\nconstraints. Depending on their quantum number assignment, the diquark-type\nscalars can couple to either right or left handed quarks, or to both. We show\nthat this model can provide a viable explanation of the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse provided that the coupling to left handed quarks are present. However,\nthe coexistence of couplings to left and right handed quarks introduces\nimportant phenomenological constraints on the model, such as radiative\ncontributions to quark masses and the generation of electric dipole moments for\nnuclei, which probe the CP even and CP odd products of the relevant couplings\nconstants, respectively. We demonstrate that the strongest such constraints\narise from electric dipole moment measurements of the neutron and $^{199}$Hg.\nThese constraints are sufficiently strong that, in the absence of an intricate\nflavor structure, baryogenesis must be dominated by the couplings of the new\nscalars to left handed quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 04:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

The combination of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution\nreciprocal-lattice maps, and high-resolution cross-sectional transmission\nelectron microscopy analyses establish that all HfN films have a cube-on-cube\norientational relationship with the substrate, i.e., [001]HfN||[001]MgO and\n(100)HfN||(100)MgO. Layers grown with continuous substrate bias, in either\nAr/N2 or Kr/N2, exhibit a relatively high mosaicity and a high concentration of\ntrapped inert gas. In distinct contrast, layers grown in Kr/N2 with the\nsubstrate bias synchronized to the metal-ion-rich portion of HiPIMS pulses,\nhave much lower mosaicity, no measurable inert-gas incorporation, and a\nhardness of 25.7 GPa, in good agreement with results for epitaxial HfN(001)\nlayers grown at Ts = 650 C (Ts/Tm = 0.26).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

A signal processing algorithm that can effectively increase the\nspeech intelligibility and quality of speech signals in such complicated\nacoustic situations is highly desirable. Especially for applications involving\nmobile communication devices and hearing assistive devices. Due to the\nre-emergence of machine learning techniques, today, known as deep learning, the\nchallenges involved with such algorithms might be overcome. In this PhD thesis,\nwe study and develop deep learning-based techniques for two sub-disciplines of\nthe cocktail party problem: single-microphone speech enhancement and\nsingle-microphone multi-talker speech separation. Specifically, we conduct\nin-depth empirical analysis of the generalizability capability of modern deep\nlearning-based single-microphone speech enhancement algorithms. We show that\nperformance of such algorithms is closely linked to the training data, and good\ngeneralizability can be achieved with carefully designed training data.\nFurthermore, we propose uPIT, a deep learning-based algorithm for\nsingle-microphone speech separation and we report state-of-the-art results on a\nspeaker-independent multi-talker speech separation task. Additionally, we show\nthat uPIT works well for joint speech separation and enhancement without\nexplicit prior knowledge about the noise type or number of speakers. Finally,\nwe show that deep learning-based speech enhancement algorithms designed to\nminimize the classical short-time spectral amplitude mean squared error leads\nto enhanced speech signals which are essentially optimal in terms of STOI, a\nstate-of-the-art speech intelligibility estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 11:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Low-altitude magnetic reconnection\nassociated with flux cancellation appears to play an important role in CME\noccurrence as it can form an eruptive configuration and reduce the magnetic\nflux that contributes to the overlying, stabilising field. We conduct the first\ncomprehensive study of 20 small bipolar active regions in order to probe the\nrole of flux cancellation as an eruption trigger mechanism. We categorise\neruptions from the bipolar regions into three types related to location and\nfind that the type of eruption produced depends on the evolutionary stage of\nthe active region. In addition we find that active regions that form eruptive\nstructures by flux cancellation (low-altitude reconnection) had, on average,\nlower flux cancellation rates than the active region sample as a whole.\nTherefore, while flux cancellation plays a key role, by itself it is\ninsufficient for the production of an eruption. The results support that\nalthough flux cancellation in a sheared arcade may be able to build an eruptive\nconfiguration, a successful eruption depends upon the removal of sufficient\noverlying and stabilising field. Convergence of the bipole polarities also\nappears to be present in regions that produce an eruption.

Aim: We investigate how software\ndevelopers use emoticons differently in issue trackers in order to better\nunderstand the differences between developers and determine to which extent\nemoticons can be used as in place of sentiment analysis.

Sufficient conditions are derived for a small graph to approximate a\nlarger one in the sense of restricted similarity. These findings give rise to\nnearly-linear algorithms that, compared to both standard and advanced graph\nreduction methods, find coarse graphs of improved quality, often by a large\nmargin, without sacrificing speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 09:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 15:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

To ensure the security,\nperformance, and correctness of future web applications, there is a strong need\nfor dynamic analysis tools for WebAssembly. Unfortunately, building such tools\nfrom scratch requires knowledge of low-level details of the language, and\nperhaps even its runtime environment. This paper presents Wasabi, the first\ngeneral-purpose framework for dynamically analyzing WebAssembly. Wasabi\nprovides an easy-to-use, high-level API that allows implementing heavyweight\ndynamic analyses that can monitor all low-level behavior. The approach is based\non binary instrumentation, which inserts calls to analysis functions written in\nJavaScript into a WebAssembly binary. Wasabi addresses several unique\nchallenges not present for other binary instrumentation tools, such as the\nproblem of tracing type-polymorphic instructions with analysis functions that\nhave a fixed type, which we address through an on-demand monomorphization of\nanalysis calls. To control the overhead imposed by an analysis, Wasabi\nselectively instruments only those instructions relevant for the analysis. Our\nevaluation on compute-intensive benchmarks and real-world applications shows\nthat Wasabi (i) faithfully preserves the original program behavior, (ii)\nimposes an overhead that is reasonable for heavyweight dynamic analysis\n(depending on the program and the analyzed instructions, between 1.02x and\n163x), and (iii) makes it straightforward to implement various dynamic\nanalyses, including instruction counting, call graph extraction, memory access\ntracing, and taint analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 09:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

Spectral evolution of these bursts is well described by the atmosphere\nmodel of a passively cooling neutron star when the burst luminosity is high\nenough. The observed spectral evolution deviates from the model predictions\nwhen the burst luminosity drops below a critical value of 20-70% of the maximum\nluminosity. We suggest that these deviations are induced by the additional\nheating of the accreted particles. We present a method for computation of the\nneutron star atmosphere models heated by accreted particles assuming that their\nenergy is released via Coulomb interactions with electrons. We compute the\ntemperature structures and the emergent spectra of the atmospheres of various\nchemical compositions and investigate the dependence of the results on the\nother model parameters.

The emergent spectra deviate strongly from those of undisturbed neutron\nstar atmospheres, with the main differences being the presence of a high-energy\ntail and a strong excess in the low-energy part of the spectrum. They also lack\nthe iron absorption edge, which is visible in the spectra of undisturbed\nlow-luminosity atmospheres with solar chemical composition.

However,\nmanually developing a prototype of a software system requires additional\nefforts, which would increase the overall cost of software development. In this\npaper, we present an approach with a developed tool to automatic generation of\nprototypes from formal requirements models. A requirements model consists of a\nuse case diagram, a conceptual class diagram, use case definitions specified by\nsystem sequence diagrams and the contracts of their system operations. We\npropose a method to decompose a contract into executable parts and\nnon-executable parts. A set of transformation rules is given to decompose the\nexecutable part into pre-implemented primitive operations. A non-executable\npart is usually realized by significant algorithms such as sorting a list,\nfinding the shortest path or domain-specific computation. It can be implemented\nmanually or by using existing code. A CASE tool is developed that provides an\ninterface for developers to develop a program for each non-executable part of a\ncontract, and automatically transforms the executables into sequences of\npre-implemented primitive operations. We have conducted four cases studies with\nover 50 use cases. The experimental result shows that the 93.65% of requirement\nspecifications are executable, and only 6.35% are non-executable such as\nsorting and event-call, which can be implemented by developers manually or\ninvoking the APIs of advanced algorithms in Java library. The one second\ngenerated the prototype of a case study requires approximate nine hours manual\nimplementation by a skilled programmer. Overall, the result is satisfiable, and\nthe proposed approach with the developed CASE tool can be applied to the\nsoftware industry for requirements engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 10:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

However, most microscopic studies\nof low-energy nuclear reactions neglect the tensor force, resulting in a lack\nof knowledge concerning the effect of the tensor force on HIC...... Purpose:\nThe theoretical study of the influence of the tensor force on heavy-ion\ninteraction potentials is required to further our understanding of the\nmicroscopic mechanisms entailed in fusion dynamics. Method: The full Skyrme\ntensor force is implemented into the static Hartree-Fock and dynamic\ndensity-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) theory to calculate\nboth static (frozen density) and dynamic microscopic interaction potentials for\nreactions involving exotic and stable nuclei. Results: The static potentials\nare found to be systematically higher than the dynamical results, which are\nattributed to the microscopic dynamical effects included in TDHF. We also show\nthat the dynamical potential barriers vary more significantly by the inclusion\nof tensor force than the static barriers. The influence of isoscalar and\nisovector tensor terms is also investigated with the TIJ set of forces. For\nlight systems, the tensor force is found to have an imperceptible effect on the\nnucleus-nucleus potential. However, for medium and heavy spin-unsaturated\nreactions, the potentials may change from a fraction of an MeV to almost 2 MeV\nby the inclusion of tensor force, indicating a strong impact of the tensor\nforce on sub-barrier fusion. Conclusions: The tensor force could indeed play a\nlarge role in the fusion of nuclei, with spin-unsaturated systems seeing a\nsystematic increase in ion-ion barrier height and width. This fusion hindrance\nis partly due to static, ground state effects from the inclusion of the tensor\nforce, though additional hindrance appears when studying nuclear dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 11:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 03:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

We introduce a versatile\ntechnique to build families of Bell inequalities witnessing different notions\nof multipartite nonlocality for any number of parties. The idea behind our\nmethod is simple: a known Bell inequality satisfying certain constraints, for\nexample the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, serves as the $seed$ to\nbuild new families of inequalities for more parties. The constructed\ninequalities have a clear operational meaning, capturing an essential feature\nof multipartite correlations: their violation implies that numerous subgroups\nof parties violate the inequality chosen as seed. The more multipartite\nnonlocal the correlations, the more subgroups can violate the seed. We\nillustrate our construction using different seeds and designing Bell\ninequalities to detect $m$-way nonlocal multipartite correlations, in\nparticular, $genuine$ $multipartite$ $nonlocal$ correlations -- the strongest\nnotion of multipartite nonlocality. For one of our inequalities we prove\nanalytically that a large class of pure states that are genuine multipartite\nentangled exhibit genuine multipartite nonlocality for any number of parties,\neven for some states that are almost product. We also provide numerical\nevidence that this family is violated by all genuine multipartite entangled\npure states of three and four qubits.

This\ncore forms by accreting solids, either planetesimals, or pebbles. A key\nconstraint in this model is that the accretion of gas must proceed before the\ndissipation of the gas disc. Classical planetesimal accretion scenario predicts\nthat the time needed to form a giant planets core is much longer than the time\nneeded to dissipate the disc. This difficulty led to the development of another\naccretion scenario, in which cores grow by accretion of pebbles, which are much\nsmaller and thus more easily accreted, leading to a more rapid formation. The\naim of this paper is to compare our updated pebble-based planet formation model\nwith observations, in particular the well studied metallicity effect. We adopt\nthe Bitsch et al. 2015a disc model and the Bitsch et al. 2015b pebble model and\nuse a population synthesis approach to compare the formed planets with\nobservations. We find that keeping the same parameters as in Bitsch et al.\n2015b leads to no planet growth due to a computation mistake in the pebble flux\n(Bitsch et al. 2017). Indeed a large fraction of the heavy elements should be\nput into pebbles (Zpeb/Ztot = 0.9) in order to form massive planets using this\napproach. The resulting mass functions show a huge amount of giants and a lack\nof Neptune mass planets, which are abundant according to observations. To\novercome this issue we include the computation of the internal structure for\nthe planetary atmosphere to our model. This leads to the formation of Neptune\nmass planets but no observable giants. Reducing the opacity of the planetary\nenvelope finally matches observations better. We conclude that modeling the\ninternal structure for the planetary atmosphere is necessary to reproduce\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 12:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

However, there is a gap in our understanding of\nthe crystallization of these systems because existing theories such as integral\nequation theory and lattice sum methods can only be used to study the high\ntemperature fluid phase and the zero-temperature crystal phase, respectively.\nIn this paper we bridge this gap by developing a density functional theory\n(DFT), valid at intermediate temperatures, in order to study the\ncrystallization of one and two-component dipolar colloidal monolayers. The\ntheory employs a series expansion of the excess Helmholtz free energy\nfunctional, truncated at second order in the density, and taking as input\nhighly accurate bulk fluid direct correlation functions from simulation.\nAlthough truncating the free energy at second order means that we cannot\ndetermine the freezing point accurately, our approach allows us to calculate ab\ninitio both the density profiles of the different species and the symmetry of\nthe final crystal structures. Our DFT predicts hexagonal crystal structures for\none-component systems, and a variety of superlattice structures for\ntwo-component systems, including those with hexagonal and square symmetry, in\nexcellent agreement with known results for these systems. The theory also\nprovides new insights into the structure of two-component systems in the\nintermediate temperature regime where the small particles remain molten but the\nlarge particles are frozen on a regular lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 13:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

On the\nother hand, in generic systems such expectation values relax to stationary\nvalues described by the thermal ensemble, fixed solely by the energy of the\nstate. At the heart of understanding this dichotomy is the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH): individual eigenstates in nonintegrable\nsystems are thermal, in the sense that expectation values agree with the\nthermal prediction at a temperature set by the energy of the eigenstate. In\nsystems where ETH is violated, thermalization can be avoided. Thus establishing\nthe range of validity of ETH is crucial in understanding whether a given\nquantum system thermalizes.

In 2015, Barman et al.

We recently devised a new method to analyse\nIFU data, called molecule mapping, searching for high-frequency signatures of\nparticular molecules in an IFU data cube.\n  Aims. The aim of this paper is to use the molecule mapping technique to\nsearch for the previously detected spectral signatures in HR8799b using the\nsame data, allowing a comparison of molecule mapping with previous methods.\n  Methods. The medium-resolution H- and K-band pipeline-reduced archival data\nwere retrieved from the Keck archive facility. Telluric and stellar lines were\nremoved from each spectrum in the data cube, after which the residuals were\ncross-correlated with model spectra of carbon monoxide, water, and methane.\n  Results. Both carbon monoxide and water are clearly detected at high\nsignal-to-noise, however, methane is not retrieved.\n  Conclusions. Molecule mapping works very well on the OSIRIS data of exoplanet\nHR8799b. However, it is not evident why methane is detected in the original\nanalysis, but not with the molecule mapping technique. Possible causes could be\nthe presence of telluric residuals, different spectral filtering techniques, or\nthe use of different methane models. We do note that in the original analysis\nmethane was only detected in the K-band, while the H-band methane signal could\nbe expected to be comparably strong. More sensitive observations with the JWST\nwill be capable of confirming or disproving the presence of methane in this\nplanet at high confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}
