We explore the\ninelastic scattering mechanism between different side-bands, induced by\nirradiation, by using Floquet scattering matrix approach. The scattering\nprobabilities between two nearest side-bands depend monotonically on the\nstrength of the amplitude of the irradiation. The external irradiation induces\ngap into the band dispersion which is strongly dependent on the angular\norientation of momentum. Although, the high frequency limit indicates that the\ngap opening does not occur in an irradiated semi-Dirac material, a careful\nanalysis of the full band structure beyond this limit reveals that gap opening\nindeed appears for higher values of momentum (away from the Dirac point).\nFurthermore, the angular dependent dynamical gap is also present which cannot\nbe captured within the high frequency approximation. The contrasting features\nof irradiated semi-Dirac material, in comparison to irradiated graphene, can be\nprobed via the behavior of conductance. The latter exhibits the appearance of\nnon-zero conductance dips due to the gap opening in Floquet band spectrum.\nMoreover, by considering a nanoribbon geometry of such material, we also show\nthat it can host a pair of edge modes which are fully decoupled from the bulk,\nwhich is in contrast to the case of graphene nanoribbon where the edge modes\nare coupled to the bulk.

The final states of the\nprobe are reconstructed by means of state tomography. An alternative is offered\nby ancilla-assisted process tomography: a single probe-ancilla state is used,\nand the correlations existing between probe and ancilla are exploited to fully\nreconstruct the information on the channel. In order for ancilla-assisted\nprocess tomography to be possible, the probe-ancilla input state does not need\nto be entangled, but still needs to have maximal operator Schmidt rank. Here we\nestablish and analyze a framework for process tomography that interpolates\nbetween these two methods, aiming at exploiting any correlations that may exist\nbetween probe and ancilla to allow process tomography with as few input\npreparations as possible, when the probe-ancilla state may be\noperator-Schmidt-rank deficient. The main object of our investigation is the\nminimal number of initial local operations on the input probe for a given\nstarting probe-ancilla state that are needed to allow process tomography. We\nprove that such a number scales inversely proportional to the operator Schmidt\nrank of the input probe-ancilla state for arbitrary local input processing. We\nalso provide results for the case where this initial local processing is\nrestricted to be a unitary rotation, in particular showing that the mentioned\nscaling is satisfied for pure input entangled states, and that in the case of\nmixed states there might be extreme cases where the fixed input probe-ancilla\nstate provides information on a $\\approx d^2/2$-dimensional subspace of the\noperator space and a single additional input unitary rotation allows process\ntomography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 16:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-03"}

The severity of OSA can lead to many symptoms such as sudden cardiac\ndeath (SCD). Polysomnography (PSG) is a gold standard for OSA diagnosis. It\nrecords many signals from the patient's body for at least one whole night and\ncalculates the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) which is the number of apnea or\nhypopnea incidences per hour. This value is then used to classify patients into\nOSA severity levels.

We focused on the classification between normal\nsubjects (AHI $<$ 5) and severe OSA patients (AHI $>$ 30). The 15-second raw\nECG records with apnea or hypopnea events were used with a series of deep\nlearning models. The main advantages of our proposed method include easier data\nacquisition, instantaneous OSA severity detection, and effective feature\nextraction without domain knowledge from expertise. To evaluate our proposed\nmethod, 545 subjects of which 364 were normal and 181 were severe OSA patients\nobtained from the MrOS sleep study (Visit 1) database were used with the k-fold\ncross-validation technique.

This sample unveils diverse specimens of Ly$\\alpha$\nnebulosities extending for tens of kiloparsecs around these quasars (on average\nout to a maximum projected distance of 80 kpc) above a surface brightness\nSB$>8.8\\times10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ ($2\\sigma$). The\nbulk of the extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission is within R<50 kpc, and is\ncharacterized by relatively quiescent kinematics, with average velocity\ndispersions of $\\langle \\sigma_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}\\rangle < 400$~km~s$^{-1}$.\nTherefore, the motions within all these Ly$\\alpha$ nebulosities have amplitudes\nconsistent with gravitational motions expected in dark matter halos hosting\nquasars at these redshifts, possibly reflecting the complexity in propagating a\nfast wind on large scales. Our current data suggest a combination of\nphotoionization and resonant scattering as powering mechanisms of the\nLy$\\alpha$ emission. We discover the first $z\\sim3$ ELAN, which confirms a very\nlow probability ($\\sim1\\%$) of occurrence of such extreme systems at these\ncosmic epochs. Finally, we discuss the redshift evolution currently seen in\nextended Ly$\\alpha$ emission around radio-quiet quasars from $z\\sim3$ to\n$z\\sim2$, concluding that it is possibly linked to a decrease of cool gas mass\nwithin the quasars' CGM from $z\\sim3$ to $z\\sim2$, and thus to the balance of\ncool vs hot media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 17:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

In this paper we present a\ndetailed study of the power spectrum of the projected mass density\n(convergence) field of substructure in a Milky Way-sized halo. This power\nspectrum has been suggested as a key observable that can be extracted from\nstrongly lensed images and yield important clues about the matter distribution\nwithin the lens galaxy. We use two different $N$-body simulations from the\nETHOS framework: one with cold dark matter and another with self-interacting\ndark matter and a cutoff in the initial power spectrum. Despite earlier works\nthat identified $ k \\gtrsim 100$ kpc$^{-1}$ as the most promising scales to\nlearn about the particle nature of dark matter we find that even at lower\nwavenumbers - which are actually within reach of observations in the near\nfuture - we can gain important information about dark matter. Comparing the\namplitude and slope of the power spectrum on scales $0.1 \\lesssim k/$kpc$^{-1}\n\\lesssim 10$ from lenses at different redshifts can help us distinguish between\ncold dark matter and other exotic dark matter scenarios that alter the\nabundance and central densities of subhalos. Furthermore, by considering the\ncontribution of different mass bins to the power spectrum we find that subhalos\nin the mass range $10^7 - 10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$ are on average the largest\ncontributors to the power spectrum signal on scales $2 \\lesssim k/$kpc$^{-1}\n\\lesssim 15$, despite the numerous subhalos with masses $> 10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$ in\na typical lens galaxy. Finally, by comparing the power spectra obtained from\nthe subhalo catalogs to those from the particle data in the simulation\nsnapshots we find that the seemingly-too-simple halo model is in fact a fairly\ngood approximation to the much more complex array of substructure in the lens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

We assume previous\nknowledge of probability and some knowledge of linear algebra. We do not assume\nprevious knowledge of Kalman filters or Bayes filters. This document derives an\nEKF for various models of drones in 1D, 2D, and 3D. We use the EKF and notation\nas defined in Thrun et al. [13]. We also give pseudocode for the Bayes filter,\nthe EKF, and the Unscented Kalman filter [14]. The motivation behind this\ndocument is the lack of a step-by-step EKF tutorial that provides the\nderivations for a quadrotor helicopter. The goal of estimation is to infer the\ndrone's state (pose, velocity, acceleration, and biases) from its sensor values\nand control inputs. This problem is challenging because sensors are noisy.\nAdditionally, because of weight and cost issues, many drones have limited\non-board computation so we want to estimate these values as quickly as\npossible. The standard method for performing this method is the Extended Kalman\nfilter, a nonlinear extension of the Kalman filter which linearizes a nonlinear\ntransition and measurement model around the current state. However the\nUnscented Kalman filter is better in almost every respect: simpler to\nimplement, more accurate to estimate, and comparable runtimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 19:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

An\nimportant recent development in this field is the measurement and manipulation\nof extremely confined phonon-polariton modes in polar dielectrics such as\nsilicon carbide and hexagonal boron nitride, which pave the way for\nnanophotonics and extreme light-matter interactions in the mid-IR to THz\nfrequency range. To further advance this promising field, it is of great\ninterest to predict the optical response of recently discovered and\nyet-to-be-synthesized polaritonic materials alike. Here we develop a unified\nframework based on quantum linear response theory to calculate the spatially\nnon-local dielectric function of a polar lattice in arbitrary dimensions. In\nthe case of a three-dimensional bulk material, the spatially local limit of our\ncalculation reproduces standard results for the dielectric response of a polar\nlattice. Using this framework, we provide ab initio calculations of the\ndielectric permittivity of important bulk polar dielectrics such as silicon\ncarbide and hexagonal boron nitride in good agreement with experiments. From\nthe ab initio theory, we are able to develop a microscopic understanding of\nwhich phonon modes contribute to each component of the dielectric function, as\nwell as predict features in the dielectric function that are a result of weak\nTO phonons. This formalism also identifies regime(s) where quantum nonlocal\neffects may correct the phonon polariton dispersion, extremely relevant in\nrecent atomic-scale experiments which confine electromagnetic fields to the\nscale of 1~nm. Finally, our work points the way towards first principles\ndescriptions of the effect of interface phonons, phonon strong coupling, and\nchiral phonons on the properties of phonon polaritons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 20:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

To address this issue, we propose a new defense\napproach, named MulDef, based on robustness diversity. Our approach consists of\n(1) a general defense framework based on multiple models and (2) a technique\nfor generating these multiple models to achieve high defense capability. In\nparticular, given a target model, our framework includes multiple models\n(constructed from the target model) to form a model family.

At runtime, a model is randomly selected from the family to be\napplied on each input example. Our general framework can inspire rich future\nresearch to construct a desirable model family achieving higher robustness\ndiversity.

To elucidate their signature we\nre-examine correlations between absolute brightness, differential variability,\nand apparent spot coverage for hundreds of Kepler stars with absolute\ncalibrations from Montet et al. (2017). The results are similar to theirs, but\nwe draw somewhat different conclusions. Most of the stars in this active\nsolar-type sample are spot-dominated as expected. Partly because of a dearth of\nlonger period stars, the evidence for facular dominance in this sample is both\nsparse and relatively weak.

By combining skip connections\nand deep supervision with respect to the computational feasibility of 3D\nsegmentation, we propose a fast converging and computationally efficient\nnetwork architecture for accurate segmentation. Furthermore, inspired by the\nconcept of focal loss, we propose an exponential logarithmic loss which\nbalances the labels not only by their relative sizes but also by their\nsegmentation difficulties. We achieve an average Dice coefficient of 82% on\nbrain segmentation with 20 labels, with the ratio of the smallest to largest\nobject sizes as 0.14%. Less than 100 epochs are required to reach such\naccuracy, and segmenting a 128x128x128 volume only takes around 0.4 s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 22:42:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 20:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Analysis of co-evolutionary events among\nresidues has been proved effective to inferring inter-residue contacts. The\nMarkov ran- dom field (MRF) technique, although being widely used for contact\nprediction, suffers from the following dilemma: the actual likelihood function\nof MRF is accurate but time-consuming to calculate, in contrast, approximations\nto the actual likelihood, say pseudo-likelihood, are efficient to calculate but\ninaccu- rate. Thus, how to achieve both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously\nremains a challenge. In this study, we present such an approach (called clmDCA)\nfor contact prediction. Unlike plmDCA using pseudo-likelihood, i.e., the\nproduct of conditional probability of individual residues, our approach uses\ncomposite- likelihood, i.e., the product of conditional probability of all\nresidue pairs. Com- posite likelihood has been theoretically proved as a better\napproximation to the actual likelihood function than pseudo-likelihood.\nMeanwhile, composite likelihood is still efficient to maximize, thus ensuring\nthe efficiency of clmDCA. We present comprehensive experiments on popular\nbenchmark datasets, includ- ing PSICOV dataset and CASP-11 dataset, to show\nthat: i) clmDCA alone outperforms the existing MRF-based approaches in\nprediction accuracy. ii) When equipped with deep learning technique for\nrefinement, the prediction ac- curacy of clmDCA was further significantly\nimproved, suggesting the suitability of clmDCA for subsequent refinement\nprocedure.

While there has been experimental\nprogress, a theoretical understanding of mean transport properties in these\nsystems has been lacking. In this work, we apply generalized Taylor dispersion\ntheory to analyze the long-time statistics of an active self-propelled Brownian\nparticle transported under an applied flow through the interstices of a\nperiodic lattice that serves as an idealization of a porous medium. Our\ntheoretical model, which we validate against Brownian dynamics simulations, is\napplied to unravel the roles of motility, fluid flow, and lattice geometry on\nasymptotic mean velocity and dispersivity. In weak flows, transport is\ndominated by active dispersion, which results from self-propulsion in the\npresence of noise and is hindered by the obstacles that act as entropic\nbarriers. In strong flows, shear-induced Taylor dispersion becomes the dominant\nmechanism for spreading, with pillars now acting as regions of shear production\nthat enhance dispersion. The interplay of these two effects leads to complex\nand unexpected trends, such as a non-monotonic dependence of axial dispersivity\non flow strength and a reduction in dispersion due to swimming activity in\nstrong flows. Brownian dynamics are used to cast light on the pre-asymptotic\nregime, where tailed distributions are observed in agreement with recent\nexperiments on motile micro-organisms.

In fact, what we regard as\nblack hole candidates in our view are not black holes but will be\ngravitationally contracting objects. As well known, a black hole will form by a\ngravitationally collapsing object in the infinite future in the views of\ndistant observers like us. At the very late stage of the gravitational\ncollapse, the gravitationally contracting object behaves as a black body due to\nits gravity. Due to this behavior, the physical signals produced around it\n(e.g. the quasi-normal ringings and the shadow image) will be very similar to\nthose caused in the eternal black hole spacetime. However those physical\nsignals do not necessarily imply the formation of a black hole in the future,\nsince we cannot rule out the possibility that the formation of the black hole\nis prevented by some unexpected event in the future yet unobserved.

In this paper, fast time-varying channels for massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) systems are addressed. We derive the exact channel power\nspectrum density (PSD) for the uplink from a high-speed railway (HSR) to a base\nstation (BS) and propose to further reduce the channel time variation via\nbeamforming network optimization. A large-scale uniform linear array (ULA) is\nequipped at the HSR to separate multiple Doppler shifts in angle domain through\nhigh-resolution transmit beamforming. Each branch comprises a dominant Doppler\nshift, which can be compensated to suppress the channel time variation, and we\nderive the channel PSD and the Doppler spread to assess the residual channel\ntime variation. Interestingly, the channel PSD can be exactly expressed as the\nproduct of a pattern function and a beam-distortion function. The former\nreflects the impact of array aperture and is the converted radiation pattern of\nULA, while the latter depends on the configuration of beamforming directions.\nInspired by the PSD analysis, we introduce a common configurable amplitudes and\nphases (CCAP) parameter to optimize the beamforming network, by partly removing\nthe constant modulus quantized phase constraints of matched filter (MF)\nbeamformers. In this way, the residual Doppler shifts can be ulteriorly\nsuppressed, further reducing the residual channel time variation.

Rotating drums have been used\nextensively as model systems to study granular media flow and mixing and\nsegregation. Numerous studies considered the mixing of grains with different\nsizes, but only few studies considered shape and elongation, which have been\nalready identified as important characteristics affecting packing and inducing\nsegregation. In this contribution, the mixing of binary mixtures of grains\nhaving the same volume, but different elongations was studied experimentally.\nThe mixing dynamics of a layered granular medium was characterized in a\nrotating drum, highlighting the impact of the grain shape, of the drum angular\nspeed and of the drum filling ratio. A mixed or segregated state is reached\nvery rapidly, but experiments are continued to verify that the state reached is\na steady state. The experiments demonstrated that below a critical difference\nof elongation, the grains can be mixed effectively. Conversely, when grain\nelongations are very different, a central core is formed, rich in the more\nelongated grains. In this case only limited mixing can be achieved. These\nresults can guide the formulation of mixtures of grains with different\nelongations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2018 11:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Good flexibility\nis key for exploiting 2D materials in many emerging technologies, such as\nwearable electronics, bioelectronics, protective coatings and composites [1]\nand recently bending has been suggested as a route to tune electronic transport\nbehaviour [2]. For virtually all crystalline materials macroscopic deformation\nis accommodated by the movement of dislocations and through the formation of\ntwinning defects [3]; it is the geometry of the resulting microstructure that\nlargely determines the mechanical and electronic properties. Despite this, the\natomic microstructure of 2D materials after mechanical deformation has not been\nwidely investigated: only by understanding these deformed microstructures can\nthe resulting properties be accurately predicted and controlled. In this paper\nwe describe the different structural features that can form as a result of\nbending in van der Waals (vdW) crystals of 2D materials. We show that twin\nboundaries, an important class of crystal defect, are delocalised by several nm\nand not atomically sharp as has been assumed for over half a century [4].

For example, in query-as-a-service systems, where\nusers are charged per processed byte, collections of queries accessing the same\ndata frequently can become expensive. The problem is compounded by the limited\noptions for the user to optimize query execution when using declarative\ninterfaces such as SQL. In this paper, we show how, without modifying existing\nsystems and without the involvement of the cloud provider, it is possible to\nsignificantly reduce the overhead, and hence the cost, of query-as-a-service\nsystems. Our approach is based on query rewriting so that multiple concurrent\nqueries are combined into a single query. Our experiments show the aggregated\namount of work done by the shared execution is smaller than in a\nquery-at-a-time approach. Since queries are charged per byte processed, the\ncost of executing a group of queries is often the same as executing a single\none of them.

Second, even those conditions that do not produce\nvisible changes to the structure of the iris may increase the dissimilarity\nbetween samples of the same eyes. Third, eye conditions affecting the geometry\nor the tissue structure of the iris or otherwise producing obstructions\nsignificantly decrease same-eye similarity and have a lower, yet still\nstatistically significant, influence on impostor comparison scores.

The main reasons for this\nfeeling may be due to the interplay of the following factors: (1) the visual\ncomplexity of the game is unexpectedly increased compared with the previous\ntime period as more and more game objects and effects are rendered on the\ndisplay; (2) and/or the game is lagging; (3) and finally, it is also possible\nthat the players have no sufficient experience with controlling the character.\nThis paper focuses on the first reason. We have developed a benchmark program\nwhich allows its user to experience the feeling of losing character. While the\nuser can control the character well the benchmark program will increase the\nvisual complexity of the display. Otherwise, if the user lost the character\nthen the program will decrease the complexity until the user will find the\ncharacter again, and so on. The complexity is measured based on the number of\nchanged pixels between two consecutive display images.

Networks are usually modeled by graphs or hypergraphs; nonetheless a\ngiven entity can occur many times in a relationship: this brings the need to\ndeal with multisets instead of sets or simple edges. Diffusion processes are\nuseful to highlight interesting parts of a network: they usually start with a\nstroke at one vertex and diffuse throughout the network to reach a uniform\ndistribution. Several iterations of the process are required prior to reaching\na stable solution. We propose an alternative solution to highlighting the main\ncomponents of a network using a diffusion process based on exchanges: it is an\niterative two-phase step exchange process. This process allows to evaluate the\nimportance not only of the vertices but also of the regrouping level. To model\nthe diffusion process, we extend the concept of hypergraphs that are families\nof sets to families of multisets, that we call hb-graphs.

Specifically, the influence of removing a training sample is\nquantifiable, and we propose a Two-Round Training approach, aiming to achieve\nhigher generalization accuracy.

Analysis performed for four\nindependent iris recognition methods shows that the common claim of the iris\nbeing useless for biometric identification soon after death is not entirely\ntrue. Since the pupil has a constant and neutral dilation after death (the so\ncalled \"cadaveric position\"), this makes the iris pattern perfectly visible\nfrom the standpoint of dilation. We found that more than 90% of irises are\nstill correctly recognized when captured a few hours after death, and that\nserious iris deterioration begins approximately 22 hours later, since the\nrecognition rate drops to a range of 13.3-73.3% (depending on the method used)\nwhen the cornea starts to be cloudy.

Firstly, several groups of TLS stations are set on different time to\ncollect the raw point cloud of the object mountain. Next, Hierarchical Merging\nBased Multi-view (HMMR) registration algorithm is adapted to accomplish\nsingle-phase multi-view registration.In order to analyze deformation between\nmultiple periods, Iterative Global Similarity Point (IGSP) algorithm is applied\nto accomplish multiple-phase registration, which outperforms ICP in\nexperiments. Then the cloth simulation filtering (CSF) algorithm was used\ntogether with manual post-processing to remove vegetation on the slope. After\nthat, the mountain slope's digital terrain model (DTM) is generated for each\nperiod, and the distance between adjacent DTMs are calculated as the landslide\ndeformation mass. Furthermore, average deformation rate of the landslide\nsurface is calculated and analyzed.To validate the effectiveness of proposed\nworkflow, we uses the TLS data of five periods of the landslide in the Shanhou\nvillage of northern Changshan Island from 2013 to 2015. The results indicate\nthat the method can obtain centimeter-level deformation monitoring accuracy\nwhich can effectively monitor and analyze long-term landslide morphology and\ntrend as well as position the significant deformation area and determine the\ntype of landslide. In addition, the process can be automated to provide\nend-to-end TLS based long-term landslide monitoring applications, providing\nreference for monitoring and early warning of potential landslides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2018 06:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

The\ncore idea is to predict from the usage context of a variable a name that\ncaptures the meaning of the variable.
