On timescales of months, PSR J1048+2339 and XMMU\nJ083850.38$-$282756.8 exhibit similar variability of $\\approx0.3$ mag on the\nheated side of the companion star. However, the heating light curve is rarely\nsymmetric, suggesting that the intrabinary shock generated by the pulsar wind\nis skewed in addition to being variable, or that changing magnetic fields\nintrinsic to the companion channel the pulsar wind. In addition to this\nvariable heating, there are long-lived flaring states that increase the\nbrightness by an additional 0.5 mag, with variability on $\\approx10$ minute\ntimescales. These flares also appear to originate on the heated side of the\ncompanion, while the \"night\"-side brightness remains relatively stable.\nSomewhat less active, PSR J1628$-$3205 has an optical light curve that is\ndominated by tidal distortion (ellipsoidal modulation), although it too shows\nevidence of variable and asymmetric heating due to shifting magnetic fields or\nmigrating star spots. These effects frustrate any effort to derive system\nparameters such as inclination angle and Roche-lobe filling factor from optical\nlight curves of redback MSPs. We also report on two Chandra X-ray observations\nof PSR J1048+2339 that show strong orbital modulation, possibly due to beaming\nalong the intrabinary shock, and a third observation that is dominated by\nflaring. The peak flare luminosity in the 0.3-8 keV band is $\\approx12\\%$ of\nthe pulsar's spin-down power, which may require magnetic reconnection. None of\nthese three systems has yet shown a transition back to an accreting state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2018 16:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Crucially, the single deformation\nparameter, $q$, contains all the information about the many-particle\ninteractions in the system. We exemplify our approach by considering a quantum\nrotor interacting with a bath of bosons, and demonstrate that extracting the\nvalue of $q$ from closed-form solutions in the perturbative regime allows one\nto predict the behavior of the system for arbitrary values of the impurity-bath\ncoupling strength, in good agreement with non-perturbative calculations.\nFurthermore, the value of the deformation parameter allows to predict at which\ncoupling strengths rotor-bath interactions result in a formation of a stable\nquasiparticle.

To\nfully exploit edge storage resources, the most popular contents should be\nidentified and cached. Observing that user demands on certain contents vary\ngreatly at different locations, this paper devises location-customized caching\nschemes to maximize the total content hit rate. Specifically, a linear model is\nused to estimate the future content hit rate. For the case where the model\nnoise is zero-mean, a ridge regression based online algorithm with positive\nperturbation is proposed. Regret analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm\nasymptotically approaches the optimal caching strategy in the long run. When\nthe noise structure is unknown, an $H_{\\infty}$ filter based online algorithm\nis further proposed by taking a prescribed threshold as input, which guarantees\nprediction accuracy even under the worst-case noise process.

Moreover, extensive experiments on real world dataset are\nconducted to validate the applicability of the proposed algorithms.

The unbiased predictive risk estimator is one suggested method for\nfinding the regularization parameter when the noise in the measurements is\nnormally distributed with known variance. In this paper we provide an algorithm\nusing the unbiased predictive risk estimator that automatically finds both the\nregularization parameter and the number of terms to use from the singular value\ndecomposition. Underlying the algorithm is a new result that proves that the\nregularization parameter converges with the number of terms from the singular\nvalue decomposition. For the analysis it is sufficient to assume that the\ndiscrete Picard condition is satisfied for exact data and that noise completely\ncontaminates the measured data coefficients for a sufficiently large number of\nterms, dependent on both the noise level and the degree of ill-posedness of the\nsystem. A lower bound for the regularization parameter is provided leading to a\ncomputationally efficient algorithm.

Simulations for\ntwo-dimensional examples verify the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness\nof the algorithm for increasing noise levels, and demonstrate that the relative\nreconstruction errors obtained using the truncated singular value decomposition\nare less than those obtained using the singular value decomposition.

Such an analysis allows us to derive\ncorrections to the waveform amplitude, which extends many of previous works\nthat focused on phase corrections only.

We analyze monopole quark interactions\nand show that massless quarks colliding with the monopoles inevitably change\ntheir chiralities keeping their flavors. The monopole quark interaction\nexplicitly breaks the chiral symmetry ( SU$_A(2)\\times $U$_A$(1) ) just like\nbare quark masses. It is given by $\\bar{q}q\\Phi^{\\dagger}\\Phi$ with the\nmonopole field $\\Phi$. The pions are not Nambu-Goldstone bosons even in the\nvanishing bare quark masses. Their masses are mainly determined by the\ninteraction because the monopole condensation generates a larger current quark\nmass than the bare quark masses. Based on the analysis of the monopole quark\ninteraction, we propose a phenomenological linear sigma model coupled with the\nmonopoles. The monopoles couple only with isoscalar scalar mesons e.g. sigma\nmeson $\\sigma$ such as $\\sigma\\Phi^{\\dagger}\\Phi$ indicated by the monopole\nquark interaction. The coupling explicitly breaks the chiral SU(2)$_A\\times\n$U$_A$(1) symmetry. Pion masses are generated by the chiral condensate, which\narises only when the monopole condensate takes place. We show that one of the\nmonopoles is a color singlet and observable. The monopole decays into hadrons (\npions, kaon, etc. ) through the coupling. Our analysis indicates that\n$f_0(1500)$ meson is a candidate of the observable monopole.

In the tunnel, space is reserved for a future pp collider,\nSPPC. The CEPC center-of-mass energy is 240 GeV, and at that collision energy\nwill serve as a Higgs factory. The design also allows operation at 91 GeV for a\nZ factory and at 160 GeV for a W factory. The heart of the CEPC is a\ndouble-ring collider. It has two interaction points where are located large\ndetectors. The Booster is in the same tunnel above the Collider. It is a\nsynchrotron with a 10 GeV injection energy and extraction energy equal to the\nbeam collision energy. The repetition cycle is 10 seconds. Top-up injection\nwill be used to maintain constant luminosity. The 10 GeV Linac, injector to the\nBooster, built at ground level, accelerates both electrons and positrons. A 1.1\nGeV damping ring reduces the positron emittance. Transport lines made of\npermanent magnets connect the Linac to the Booster.

The aim is to detect a single-compressed image that has\nthe same original image as the double-compressed ones, even when the sizes of\nthose compressed images are different. In the proposed scheme, a feature\nextracted from only DC coefficients in DCT coefficients is used for the\nidentification. The use of the feature allows us not only to robustly avoid\nerrors caused by double-compression but also to perform the identification for\ndifferent size images.

Our considered system model\nconsists of one source, one destination, one untrusted relay, and one Willie.\nThe untrusted relay tries to extract the information signal, while the goal of\nWillie is to detect the presence of the information signal transmitted by the\nsource, in the current time slot. To overcome these two attacks, we illustrate\nthat the destination and the source should inject jamming signal to the network\nin phase I and phase II, respectively. Accordingly, the communication in our\nproposed system model is accomplished in two phases. In the first phase, when\nthe source transmits its data to the untrusted relay the destination broadcasts\nits jamming signal. In the second phase, when the relay retransmits the\nreceived signal, the source transmits a jamming signal with one of its\nantennas. For this system model, we propose a power allocation strategy to\nmaximize the instantaneous secrecy rate subject to satisfying the covert\nrequirements in both of the phases. Since the proposed optimization problem is\nnon-convex, we adopt the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach to\nconvert it to a convex optimization problem. Next, we extend our system model\nto a practical system model where there are multiple untrusted relays and\nmultiple Willies under two scenarios of noncolluding Willies and colluding\nWillies.

Although it is\nshown that the source is likely an extremely dusty galaxy at high redshift, its\nexact position of submillimeter emission is unknown. With the new NOEMA\ninterferometric imaging, we confirm that the source is a unique dusty galaxy.\nIt has no obvious counterpart in the optical and even NIR images observed with\nHST at lambda~<1.4um. Photometric-redshift analyses from both stellar and dust\nSED suggest it to likely be at z~>4, though a lower redshift at z~>3.1 cannot\nbe fully ruled out (at 90% confidence interval). Explaining its unusual\noptical-to-NIR properties requires an old stellar population (~0.67 Gyr),\ncoexisting with a very dusty ongoing starburst component. The latter is\ncontributing to the FIR emission, with its rest-frame UV and optical light\nbeing largely obscured along our line of sight. If the observed fluxes at the\nrest-frame optical/NIR wavelengths were mainly contributed by old stars, a\ntotal stellar mass of ~3.5x10^11Msun would be obtained. An X-ray spectral\nanalysis suggests that this galaxy harbors a heavily obscured AGN with\nN_H=3.3x10^23 cm^-2 and an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of L_X~2.6x10^44\nerg/s, which places this object among distant type 2 quasars. The radio\nemission of the source is extremely bright, which is an order of magnitude\nhigher than the star-formation-powered emission, making it one of the most\ndistant radio-luminous dusty galaxies. The combined characteristics of the\ngalaxy suggest that the source appears to have been caught in a rare but\ncritical transition stage in the evolution of submillimeter galaxies, where we\nare witnessing the birth of a young AGN and possibly the earliest stage of its\njet formation and feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 09:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The non-Riemannian volume\nelement dynamically triggers the Gauss-Bonnet scalar to be an arbitrary\nintegration constant M on-shell, which in turn has several interesting\ncosmological implications: (i) It yields specific solutions for the Hubble\nparameter and the Friedmann scale factor as functions of time, which are\ncompletely independent of the matter dynamics, i.e., there is no back reaction\nby matter on the cosmological metric; (ii) For M>0 it predicts a\n\"coasting\"-like evolution immediately after the Big Bang, and it yields a late\nuniverse with dynamically produced dark energy density given through M; (iii)\nFor the special value M=0 we obtain exactly a linear \"coasting\" cosmology; (iv)\nFor M<0 we have in addition to the Big Bang also a Big Crunch with\n\"coasting\"-like evolution around both; (v) It allows for an explicit analytic\nsolution of the pertinent Friedmann and scalar field equations of motion, while\ndynamically fixing uniquely the functional dependence of the scalar potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 09:54:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 15:17:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 09:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The\nappearance of a human face changes substantially over time, resulting in\nsignificant intra-class variations. As opposed to current techniques for\nage-invariant face recognition, which either directly extract age-invariant\nfeatures for recognition, or first synthesize a face that matches target age\nbefore feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both\ntasks jointly so that they can leverage each other. To this end, we propose a\ndeep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for face recognition in the wild with three\ndistinct novelties. First, AIM presents a novel unified deep architecture\njointly performing cross-age face synthesis and recognition in a mutual\nboosting way. Second, AIM achieves continuous face rejuvenation/aging with\nremarkable photorealistic and identity-preserving properties, avoiding the\nrequirement of paired data and the true age of testing samples. Third, we\ndevelop effective and novel training strategies for end-to-end learning the\nwhole deep architecture, which generates powerful age-invariant face\nrepresentations explicitly disentangled from the age variation. Moreover, we\npropose a new large-scale Cross-Age Face Recognition (CAFR) benchmark dataset\nto facilitate existing efforts and push the frontiers of age-invariant face\nrecognition research. Extensive experiments on both our CAFR and several other\ncross-age datasets (MORPH, CACD and FG-NET) demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed AIM model over the state-of-the-arts. Benchmarking our model on one of\nthe most popular unconstrained face recognition datasets IJB-C additionally\nverifies the promising generalizability of AIM in recognizing faces in the\nwild.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 13:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 01:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

As a consequence of such unusual\nphotonic transitions, a one-way beam splitting and amplification is exhibited\nby the STM slab. Beam splitting is a vital operation for various optical and\nphotonic systems, ranging from quantum computation to fluorescence spectroscopy\nand microscopy. Despite the beam splitting is conceptually a simple operation,\nthe performance characteristics of beam splitters significantly influence the\nrepeatability and accuracy of the entire optical system. As of today, there has\nbeen no approach exhibiting a nonreciprocal beam splitting accompanied with\ntransmission gain and an arbitrary splitting angle. Here, we show that oblique\nillumination of a periodic and semi-coherent dynamically-modulated slab results\nin coherent photonic transitions between the incident light beam and its\ncounterpart space-time harmonic (STH). Such photonic transitions introduce a\nunidirectional synchronization and momentum exchange between two STHs with same\ntemporal frequencies, but opposite spatial frequencies. Such a beam splitting\ntechnique offers high isolation, transmission gain and zero beam tilting, and\nis expected to drastically decrease the resource and isolation requirements in\noptical and photonic systems.

The\nCMLMC method optimally balances statistical errors due to sampling of the\nparametric space, and numerical errors due to the discretization of the\ngeometry using a hierarchy of discretizations, from coarse to fine. The number\nof realizations of finer discretizations can be kept low, with most samples\ncomputed on coarser discretizations to minimize computational cost.\nConsequently, the total execution time is significantly reduced, in comparison\nto the standard MC scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 15:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Anticipating future\nexperiments to improve synthetic antibodies, we investigate whether linkers\nwith different rigidities could enhance diFab potency by modeling DNA-Fabs\ncontaining different combinations of rigid dsDNA and flexible single-stranded\nDNA (ssDNA) and characterizing their neutralization potential. Model\npredictions suggest that while a long flexible polymer may be capable of\nbivalent binding, it exhibits weak neutralization due to the large loss in\nentropic degrees of freedom when both Fabs are bound. In contrast, the\nstrongest neutralization potencies are predicted to require a rigid linker that\noptimally spans the distance between two Fab binding sites on an Env trimer,\nand avidity can be further boosted by incorporating more Fabs into these\nconstructs. These results inform the design of multivalent anti-HIV-1\ntherapeutics that utilize avidity effects to remain potent against HIV-1 in the\nface of the rapid mutation of Env spikes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 01:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 06:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

The solution may then give\nthe skier the most comfortable skiing method without any active movement to\ncontrol the ski. The generalized force supporting the point mass from the ski\nplate was calculated. We obtained the force from the ground (rebound force)\nwithout any geometrical structure of the ski plate. Adding an active movement\nto the direction of the ski plate, the conditions for the stable ski turn were\nalso analyzed.

However, the synthesis of\nsingle-phase, multi-principal covalent compounds remains a challenge. Here we\npresent a diffusion-controlled alloying strategy for the successful realization\nof covalent multi-principal transition metal carbides (MPTMCs) with a single\nface-centered cubic (FCC) phase. The increased interfacial diffusion promoted\nby the addition of a nonstoichiometric compound leads to rapid formation of the\nnew single phase at much lower sintering temperature. Direct atomic-level\nobservations via scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that\nMPTMCs are composed of a single phase with a random distribution of all\ncations, which holds the key to the unique combinations of improved fracture\ntoughness, superior Vickers hardness, and extremely lower thermal diffusivity\nachieved in MPTMCs. The present discovery provides a promising approach toward\nthe design and synthesis of next-generation high-performance materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 09:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}
