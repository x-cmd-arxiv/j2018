The most famous example is the\ndistribution of secret key.

In practice, channel losses have limited the reach of quantum\nprotocols to short distances. Quantum repeaters have the potential to\nsignificantly increase the rates and reach beyond the limits of direct\ntransmission.

Person Search is recently explored using natural\nlanguage based text description of images for video surveillance applications\n(S.Li et.al). We see (Fu.et al) provides an end to end approach for\nobject-based retrieval using deep reinforcement learning without constraints\nplaced on which objects are being detected. However, we believe for real-world\napplications such as person search defining specific constraints which identify\na person as opposed to starting with a general object detection will have\nbenefits in terms of performance and computational resources required. In our\ntask, Deep reinforcement learning would localize the person in an image by\nreshaping the sizes of the bounding boxes. Deep Reinforcement learning with\nappropriate constraints would look only for the relevant person in the image as\nopposed to an unconstrained approach where each individual objects in the image\nare ranked. For person search, the agent is trying to form a tight bounding box\naround the person in the image who matches the description. The bounding box is\ninitialized to the full image and at each time step, the agent makes a decision\non how to change the current bounding box so that it has a tighter bound around\nthe person based on the description of the person and the pixel values of the\ncurrent bounding box. After the agent takes an action, it will be given a\nreward based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the current bounding box\nand the ground truth box. Once the agent believes that the bounding box is\ncovering the person, it will indicate that the person is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 16:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

In particular, simulations showed that $\\left\\langle\nf\\right\\rangle $, the average fraction of cross-links between the two groups\n(which serves as an 'order parameter' here), jumps dramatically when $\\Delta\n\\equiv N_{I}-N_{E}$ crosses the 'critical point' $\\Delta _{c}=0$, as in typical\nfirst order transitions. Yet, at criticality, there is no phase co-existence,\nbut the fluctuations of $f$ are much larger than in typical second order\ntransitions. Indeed, it was conjectured that, in the thermodynamic limit, both\nthe jump and the fluctuations become maximal, so that the system is said to\ndisplay an 'extreme Thouless effect.' While earlier theories are partially\nsuccessful, we provide a mean-field like approach that accounts for all known\nsimulation data and validates the conjecture.

Due to\nthe use of extremely powerful hydraulic manipulator, a force-reflected\nbilateral teleoperation is the most reasonable method of giving a human\ndemonstration. An advanced subsystem-dynamic-based control design framework,\nvirtual decomposition control (VDC), is used to design a stability-guaranteed\ncontroller for the teleoperation system, while taking into account the full\nnonlinear dynamics of the master and slave manipulators. The use of fragile\nforce/ torque sensor at the tip of the hydraulic slave manipulator is avoided\nby estimating the contact forces from the manipulator actuators' chamber\npressures. In the proposed learning method, it is observed that a\nsurface-sliding tool has a friction-dependent range of directions (between the\nactual direction of motion and the contact force) from which the manipulator\ncan apply force to produce the sliding motion. By this intuition, an\nintersection of these ranges can be taken over a motion to robustly find a\ndesired direction for the motion from one or more demonstrations. The compliant\naxes required to reproduce the motion can be found by assuming that all motions\noutside the desired direction is caused by the environment, signalling the need\nfor compliance. Finally, the learning method is incorporated to a novel\nVDC-based impedance control method to learn compliant behaviour from\nteleoperated human demonstrations. Experiments with 2-DOF hydraulic manipulator\nwith a 475kg payload demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the\nproposed method to perform learning from demonstration (LfD) with heavy-duty\nhydraulic manipulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 19:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

From a logical perspective completion can be\nseen as a way to make problems independent of their premises. Alongside with\nthe completion operator and total Weihrauch reducibility we need to study\nprecomplete representations that are required to describe these concepts. In\norder to show that the parallelized total Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer\nalgebra, we introduce a new multiplicative version of an implication. While the\nparallelized total Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer algebra with this\nimplication, the total Weihrauch lattice fails to be a model of intuitionistic\nlinear logic in two different ways. In order to pinpoint the algebraic reasons\nfor this failure, we introduce the concept of a Weihrauch algebra that allows\nus to formulate the failure in precise and neat terms. Finally, we show that\nthe Medvedev Brouwer algebra can be embedded into our Brouwer algebra, which\nalso implies that the theory of our Brouwer algebra is Jankov logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 19:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 12:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 15:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the\noperation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering\ninterest . In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an\nimitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating\nthrough city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot. Derived\nfrom the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been\nconstructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates\nthe presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input\nframes. Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in\nterms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for\nimitation learning. The data used for training the system has been captured\nfrom the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by\nexperts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience. Permissions were taken\nfrom required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is\ninvolved in the data collection process.

To address this issue, we propose a framework that\nallows (1) flexible models for the observed data and (2) clean separation of\nthe identified and unidentified parts of the sensitivity model. Our framework\nextends an approach from the missing data literature, known as Tukey's\nfactorization, to the causal inference setting.

The key to this problem is to learn\ndiscriminant view-invariant representations generalizing well across views. In\nthis paper, we address this problem by learning view-invariant representations\nhierarchically using a novel method, referred to as Joint Sparse Representation\nand Distribution Adaptation (JSRDA). To obtain robust and informative feature\nrepresentations, we first incorporate a sample-affinity matrix into the\nmarginalized stacked denoising Autoencoder (mSDA) to obtain shared features,\nwhich are then combined with the private features. In order to make the feature\nrepresentations of videos across views transferable, we then learn a\ntransferable dictionary pair simultaneously from pairs of videos taken at\ndifferent views to encourage each action video across views to have the same\nsparse representation. However, the distribution difference across views still\nexists because a unified subspace where the sparse representations of one\naction across views are the same may not exist when the view difference is\nlarge. Therefore, we propose a novel unsupervised distribution adaptation\nmethod that learns a set of projections that project the source and target\nviews data into respective low-dimensional subspaces where the marginal and\nconditional distribution differences are reduced simultaneously. Therefore, the\nfinally learned feature representation is view-invariant and robust for\nsubstantial distribution difference across views even the view difference is\nlarge.

We use this complex-angle approach to analyse the behaviour of light at\ninterfaces between lossy media and lossless media. We reveal that dissipation\nmakes the wavenumber of the light exceed the maximum allowed at lossless\ninterfaces. This is surprising because, in general, dielectric loss only change\nthe intensity profiles of the light, so this excess wavenumber cannot be\nproduced in the bulk even if there exists dielectric loss. Additionally,\nanomalous circular polarisation emerges with dissipation. The direction of the\nanomalous circular polarisation is transverse, whereas without dissipation the\ndirection of circular polarisation has to be longitudinal. We also discuss how\nthe excess wavenumber can increase optical force and how the anomalous circular\npolarisation can generate optical transverse torque.

The most puzzling aspects are 1) how the Tethys-Dione pair and\nthe Mimas-Enceladus pair passed through their strong 3:2 mean-motion resonances\nduring the tidal orbital evolution, and 2) the current strong heat flow from\nEnceladus, which is a few orders of magnitude higher than the tidal energy\ndissipation caused by the present orbital eccentricity of Enceladus. Here we\nperform N-body simulations of the moons' orbital evolution from various initial\nconditions -- assuming that the moons were formed from Saturn's hypothetical\nmassive ring -- and investigate possible paths to solve the above difficulties.\nIf the influence of the rings is neglected, we find that the Tethys-Dione pair\ncannot avoid becoming trapped in the mean-motion resonances as they recede from\nSaturn, and that the Tethys-Enceladus pair cannot avoid collisions after the\nresonance trapping, in case Saturn's quality factor is smaller than 15,000.\nThese findings are inconsistent with the current orbital configuration.\nHowever, taking into account both the eccentricity excitation and the orbital\nexpansion caused by the ring torque, we find that these resonance captures are\navoided. With the high eccentricity pumped up by the torque, Enceladus passes\nthrough the resonances with Tethys, and the Dione-Tethys pair passes through\ntheir 2:1 and possibly the 3:2 resonance as well. After Enceladus resides\nbeyond the 2:1 resonance with the outer ring edge, the eccentricity can be\ntidally damped. While this is a promising path of evolution, in most runs,\nEnceladus collides with Tethys by the excited eccentricity. There is a hint\nthat a ring mass decrease could avoid the collision. The tidal heat due to the\neccentricity excitation by the ring torque is stored in the moons and slowly\nradiated away.

In this work we investigate if\nspatially resolved observations of rarer CO isotopologues may be good tracers\nof Sigma_gas. Physical-chemical models with different input Sigma_gas(R) are\nrun. The input disk surface density profiles are compared with the simulated\n13CO intensity radial profiles to check if and where the two follow each other.\nThere is always an intermediate region in the disk where the slope of the 13CO\nradial emission profile and Sigma_gas(R) coincide. At small radii the line\nradial profile underestimates Sigma_gas, as 13CO emission becomes optically\nthick. The same happens at large radii where the column densities become too\nlow and 13CO is not able to efficiently self-shield. If the gas surface density\nprofile is a simple power-law of the radius, the input power-law index can be\nretrieved within 20% uncertainty if one choses the proper radial range. If\ninstead Sigma_gas(R) follows the self-similar solution for a viscously evolving\ndisk, retrieving the input power-law index becomes challenging, in particular\nfor small disks. Nevertheless, it is found that the power-law index can be in\nany case reliably fitted at a given line intensity contour around 6 K km/s, and\nthis produces a practical method to constrain the slope of Sigma_gas(R).\nApplication of such a method is shown in the case study of the TW Hya disk.\nSpatially resolved 13CO line radial profiles are promising to probe the disk\nsurface density distribution, as they directly trace Sigma_gas(R)profile at\nradii well resolvable by ALMA.

For the purposes of this project a\ntwin camera instrument was specially designed and installed at the 1.2 m\nKryoneri telescope utilizing the fast-frame capabilities of scientific\nComplementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor detectors (sCMOS). The system provides\na wide field-of-view (17.0' $\\times$ 14.4') and simultaneous observations in\ntwo photometric bands (R and I), reaching limiting magnitudes of 18.7 mag in 10\nsec in both bands at a 2.5 signal-to-noise level. This makes it a unique\ninstrument that can be used for the detection of NEO impacts on the Moon, as\nwell as for any astronomy projects that demand high-cadence multicolor\nobservations. The wide field-of-view ensures that a large portion of the Moon\nis observed, while the simultaneous, high-cadence, monitoring in two\nphotometric bands makes possible, for the first time, the determination of the\ntemperatures of the impacts on the Moon's surface and the validation of the\nimpact flashes from a single site.

They are typically modeled as flux ropes\n(FRs). The determination of the FR global characteristics requires the\nestimation of the FR axis orientation. Among the developed methods, the minimum\nvariance (MV) is the most flexible, and features only a few assumptions.\nHowever, as other methods, MV has biases. We aim to investigate the limits of\nthe method and extend it to a less biased method. We first identified the\norigin of the biases by testing the MV method on cylindrical and elliptical\nmodels with a temporal expansion comparable to the one observed in MCs. Then,\nwe developed an improved MV method to reduce these biases. In contrast with\nmany previous publications we find that the ratio of the MV eigenvalues is not\na reliable indicator of the precision of the derived FR axis direction. Next,\nwe emphasize the importance of the FR boundaries selected since they strongly\naffect the deduced axis orientation. We have improved the MV method by imposing\nthat the same amount of azimuthal flux should be present before and after the\ntime of closest approach to the FR axis. We emphasize the importance of finding\nsimultaneously the FR axis direction and the location of the boundaries\ncorresponding to a balanced magnetic flux, so as to minimize the bias on the\ndeduced FR axis orientation. This method can also define an inner flux-balanced\nsub-FR. We show that the MV results are much less biased when a compromise in\nsize of this sub-FR is achieved. For weakly asymmetric field temporal profiles,\nthe improved MV provides a very good determination of the FR axis orientation.\nThe main remaining bias is moderate (lower than 6 degrees) and is present\nmostly on the angle between the flux rope axis and the plane perpendicular to\nthe Sun-Earth direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 10:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

These criteria allow us to\nidentify the best fits and to identify peculiar galaxies. We perform the SED\nfitting by assuming three different dust attenuation laws separately allowing\nus to test the impact of the assumed law on estimated physical parameters.

This paper presents a room-level indoor localization approach\nbased on the measured room's echos in response to a two-millisecond single-tone\ninaudible chirp emitted by a smartphone's loudspeaker. Different from other\nacoustics-based room recognition systems that record full-spectrum audio for up\nto ten seconds, our approach records audio in a narrow inaudible band for 0.1\nseconds only to preserve the user's privacy. However, the short-time and\nnarrowband audio signal carries limited information about the room's\ncharacteristics, presenting challenges to accurate room recognition. This paper\napplies deep learning to effectively capture the subtle fingerprints in the\nrooms' acoustic responses.

Driven by deep neural\nnetworks, recent methods have brought significant improvements to object pose\nestimation. However, they suffer due to scarcity of keypoint/pose-annotated\nreal images and hence can not exploit the object's 3D structural information\neffectively. In this work, we propose a data-efficient method which utilizes\nthe geometric regularity of intraclass objects for pose estimation. First, we\nlearn pose-invariant local descriptors of object parts from simple 2D RGB\nimages. These descriptors, along with keypoints obtained from renders of a\nfixed 3D template model are then used to generate keypoint correspondence maps\nfor a given monocular real image. Finally, a pose estimation network predicts\n3D pose of the object using these correspondence maps. This pipeline is further\nextended to a multi-view approach, which assimilates keypoint information from\ncorrespondence sets generated from multiple views of the 3D template model.\nFusion of multi-view information significantly improves geometric comprehension\nof the system which in turn enhances the pose estimation performance.\nFurthermore, use of correspondence framework responsible for the learning of\npose invariant keypoint descriptor also allows us to effectively alleviate the\ndata-scarcity problem. This enables our method to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple real-image viewpoint estimation datasets, such as\nPascal3D+ and ObjectNet3D.

Here, we exploit a fruitful interplay of\nideas from both fields to begin developing a unifying approach to\ntransformations among quantum reference systems that ultimately aims at\nencompassing both quantum and gravitational physics. In particular, using a\ngravity inspired symmetry principle, which enforces physical observables to be\nrelational and leads to an inherent redundancy in the description, we develop a\nperspective-neutral structure, which contains all frame perspectives at once\nand via which they are changed. We show that taking the perspective of a\nspecific frame amounts to a fixing of the symmetry related redundancies in both\nthe classical and quantum theory and that changing perspective corresponds to a\nsymmetry transformation. We implement this using the language of constrained\nsystems, which naturally encodes symmetries.

But,\nthe task of identification becomes quite challenging if metadata are absent\nfrom the image and/or if the image has been post-processed. In this paper, we\npresent a DenseNet pipeline to solve the problem of identifying the source\ncamera-model of an image. Our approach is to extract patches of 256*256 from a\nlabeled image dataset and apply augmentations, i.e., Empirical Mode\nDecomposition (EMD). We use this extended dataset to train a Neural Network\nwith the DenseNet-201 architecture. We concatenate the output features for 3\ndifferent sizes (64*64, 128*128, 256*256) and pass them to a secondary network\nto make the final prediction. This strategy proves to be very robust for\nidentifying the source camera model, even when the original image is\npost-processed.

The simulation results indicate that under compressive loading, the\norientations close to $<$100$>$ corner deform by twinning mechanism, while the\nremaining orientations deform by dislocation slip. On the other hand, all the\nnanowires deform by twinning mechanism under tensile loading. Further, the\norientations close to $<$110$>$ and $<$111$>$ corner exhibit\ntension-compression asymmetry in deformation mechanisms. In addition to\ndeformation mechanisms, Cu nanowires also display tension-compression asymmetry\nin yield stress.

In conjunction with this analysis we\nperform extensive numerical simulations of the original network of QIF neurons,\nand determine the relation between the macroscopic and microscopic states for\npartially synchronous states. The results are summarized in two phase diagrams,\nfor homogeneous and heterogeneous populations, which are obtained analytically\nto a large extent. For excitatory coupling, the phase diagram is remarkably\nsimilar to that of the Kuramoto model with time delays, although here the\nstability boundaries extend to regions in parameter space where the neurons are\nnot self-sustained oscillators. In contrast, the structure of the boundaries\nfor inhibitory coupling is different, and already for homogeneous networks\nunveils the presence of various partially synchronized states not present in\nthe Kuramoto model: Collective chaos, quasiperiodic partial synchronization\n(QPS), and a novel state which we call modulated-QPS (M-QPS). In the presence\nof heterogeneity partially synchronized states reminiscent to collective chaos,\nQPS and M-QPS persist.

In the proposal, an\noptical cat state is first prepared in an optical cavity, then transferred to\nthe mechanical mode, where it is stored and later retrieved using control\nfields. We carry out numerical simulations for the quantum memory protocol for\noptomechanical cat states using the positive-P phase space representation. This\nhas a compact, positive representation for a cat state, thus allowing a\nprobabilistic simulation of this highly non-classical quantum system. To verify\nthe effectiveness of the cat-state quantum memory, we consider several\ncat-state signatures and show how they can be computed. We also investigate the\neffects of decoherence on a cat state by solving the standard master equation\nfor a simplified model analytically, allowing us to compare with the numerical\nresults. Focusing on the negativity of the Wigner function as a signature of\nthe cat state, we evaluate analytically an upper bound on the time taken for\nthe negativity to vanish, for a given temperature of the environment of the\nmechanical oscillator.

As a first step, the\nhydrodynamic Green's function providing the resulting fluid flow in response to\na localized force acting on the anisotropic fluid is derived analytically. On\nthis basis, the behavior of both puller- and pusher-type microswimmers in the\nanisotropic fluid is analyzed. Depending on the propulsion mechanism and the\nrelative magnitude of different involved viscosities, we find alignment of the\nswimmers parallel or perpendicular to the anisotropy axis.

The observed\nswimmer reorientation results from the hydrodynamic coupling between the\nself-induced fluid flow and the anisotropy of the surrounding fluid, which\ndistorts the self-generated flow field.

Due to the\nneed to image an anatomic structure multiple times, parameter mapping usually\nrequires long scan times compared to conventional static imaging. Therefore,\naccelerated parameter mapping is highly-desirable and remains a topic of great\ninterest in the MR research community. While many recent deep learning methods\nhave focused on highly efficient image reconstruction for conventional static\nMR imaging, applications of deep learning for dynamic imaging and in particular\naccelerated parameter mapping have been limited. The purpose of this work was\nto develop and evaluate a novel deep learning-based reconstruction framework\ncalled Model-Augmented Neural neTwork with Incoherent k-space Sampling (MANTIS)\nfor efficient MR parameter mapping. Our approach combines end-to-end CNN\nmapping with k-space consistency using the concept of cyclic loss to further\nenforce data and model fidelity. Incoherent k-space sampling is used to improve\nreconstruction performance. A physical model is incorporated into the proposed\nframework, so that the parameter maps can be efficiently estimated directly\nfrom undersampled images. The performance of MANTIS was demonstrated for the\nspin-spin relaxation time (T2) mapping of the knee joint. Compared to\nconventional reconstruction approaches that exploited image sparsity, MANTIS\nyielded lower errors and higher similarity with respect to the reference in the\nT2 estimation. Our study demonstrated that the proposed MANTIS framework, with\na combination of end-to-end CNN mapping, signal model-augmented data\nconsistency, and incoherent k-space sampling, represents a promising approach\nfor efficient MR parameter mapping. MANTIS can potentially be extended to other\ntypes of parameter mapping with appropriate models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2018 21:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}
