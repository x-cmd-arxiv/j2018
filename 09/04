We utilize clustering to\nextract sparse fixation pixel from the raw fixation pixel map, and add a\nmax-pooling transformation on the output to avoid false penalty between sparse\noutputs and labels caused by nearby but non-overlapping saliency pixels when\ncalculating loss.

In order to produce high quality\ndepth map, say clean and accurate, we propose a network consists of a Dense\nFeature Extractor (DFE) and a Depth Map Generator (DMG). The DFE combines\nResNet and dilated convolutions. It extracts multi-scale information from input\nimage while keeping the feature maps dense. As for DMG, we use attention\nmechanism to fuse multi-scale features produced in DFE. Our Network is trained\nend-to-end and does not need any post-processing. Hence, it runs fast and can\npredict depth map in about 15 fps. Experiment results show that our method is\ncompetitive with the state-of-the-art in quantitative evaluation, but can\npreserve better structural details of the scene depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 16:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

FRB 121102 is so far the only source known to repeatedly emit FRBs\nand is associated with a host galaxy at redshift $z \\simeq 0.193$. We conducted\nsimultaneous observations of FRB 121102 with the Arecibo and MAGIC telescopes\nduring several epochs in 2016--2017. This allowed searches for\nmillisecond-timescale burst emission in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays as\nwell as the optical band. While a total of five FRBs were detected during these\nobservations, no VHE emission was detected, neither of a persistent nature nor\nburst-like associated with the FRBs.

Most state-of-the-arts leverage position-patch prior knowledge of\nhuman face to estimate the optimal representation coefficients for each image\npatch. However, they focus only the position information and usually ignore the\ncontext information of image patch. In addition, when they are confronted with\nmisalignment or the Small Sample Size (SSS) problem, the hallucination\nperformance is very poor. To this end, this study incorporates the contextual\ninformation of image patch and proposes a powerful and efficient context-patch\nbased face hallucination approach, namely Thresholding Locality-constrained\nRepresentation and Reproducing learning (TLcR-RL). Under the context-patch\nbased framework, we advance a thresholding based representation method to\nenhance the reconstruction accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To\nfurther improve the performance of the proposed algorithm, we propose a\npromotion strategy called reproducing learning. By adding the estimated HR face\nto the training set, which can simulates the case that the HR version of the\ninput LR face is present in the training set, thus iteratively enhancing the\nfinal hallucination result. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed TLcR-RL\nmethod achieves a substantial increase in the hallucinated results, both\nsubjectively and objectively. Additionally, the proposed framework is more\nrobust to face misalignment and the SSS problem, and its hallucinated HR face\nis still very good when the LR test face is from the real-world.

The results can provide evidence of the physical mechanisms\nthat drive AGN and galaxy evolution within clusters. The XXL cluster sample\nmostly comprises poor and moderately rich structures ($M=10^{13} -\n4\\times10^{14} M_{\\rm o}$). Our aim is to statistically study the demographics\nof cluster AGNs as a function of cluster mass and host galaxy position. To\ninvestigate the effect of the environment on AGN activity, we computed the\nfraction of spectroscopically confirmed X-ray AGNs ($L_{\\rm X\n[0.5-10\\,keV]}>10^{42}$ erg cm$^{-1}$) in bright cluster galaxies, up to\n$6r_{500}$ radius. To study the mass dependence and the evolution of the AGN\npopulation, we further divided the sample into low- and high-mass clusters and\ntwo redshift bins (0.1-0.28 and 0.28-0.5). We detect a significant excess of\nX-ray AGNs, at the 95% confidence level, in low-mass clusters between\n$0.5r_{500}$ and 2$r_{500}$, which drops to the field value within the cluster\ncores ($r<0.5r_{500}$). In contrast, high-mass clusters present a decreasing\nAGN fraction towards the cluster centres. The high AGN fraction in the\noutskirts is caused by low-luminosity AGNs. It can be explained by a higher\ngalaxy merging rate in low-mass clusters, where velocity dispersions are not\nhigh enough to prevent galaxy interactions and merging. Ram pressure stripping\nis possible in the cores of all our clusters, but probably stronger in deeper\ngravitational potentials. Compared with previous studies of massive or\nhigh-redshift clusters, we conclude that the AGN fraction in cluster galaxies\nanti-correlates strongly with cluster mass. The AGN fraction also increases\nwith redshift, but at the same rate with the respective fraction in field\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 18:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

As compliant motions can \"probe\" the environment, using the interaction\nbetween the robot and the environment to detect phase transitions can make the\ntransitions less prone to positional errors. This intuition leads us to model a\ntask with a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (HMM), wherein hidden phase\ntransition probabilities depend on the interaction with the environment (wrench\nmeasured by an F/T sensor). Expectation-maximization algorithm is employed in\nestimating the parameters of the HMM model. During reproduction, the phase\nchanges of a task are detected online using the forward algorithm, with the\nparameters learned from demonstrations. Cartesian impedance controller\nparameters are learned from the demonstrations to reproduce each phase of the\ntask. The proposed approach is studied with a KUKA LWR4+ arm in two setups.\nExperiments show that the method can successfully segment and reproduce a task\nconsisting of compliant motions with one or more demonstrations, even when\ndemonstrations do not have the same starting position and external forces occur\nfrom different directions.

In addition, this formulation provides a link between\nreinforcement learning and learning reachable sets for systems with unknown\ndynamics, allowing algorithms from the former to be applied to the latter. We\nuse two benchmark examples, double integrator, and pursuit-evasion games, to\nshow the correctness of the formulation as well as its strengths in comparison\nto previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2018 20:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

The total energy density, longitudinal and transverse\npressures in magnetized SQM are found as functions of the baryon chemical\npotential.

In the second problem, Alice sends a message with\nsome redundant information to Bob through a channel that can add adversarial\nerrors, and the goal is for Bob to correctly recover the message despite the\nerrors.\n  In a recent work \\cite{CJLW18}, the authors constructed explicit\ndeterministic document exchange protocols and binary error correcting codes for\nedit errors with almost optimal parameters.\\ Unfortunately, the constructions\nin \\cite{CJLW18} do not work for other common errors such as block\ntranspositions.\n  In this paper, we generalize the constructions in \\cite{CJLW18} to handle a\nmuch larger class of errors.

We study whether the\nincreased efficiency shows any general trend in how energy is dissipated by the\nmean velocity field (mean dissipation) and by the fluctuating velocity field\n(turbulent dissipation).\n  Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of different control strategies are\nperformed at Constant Power Input (CPI), so that at statistical equilibrium\neach flow (either uncontrolled or controlled by different means) has the same\npower input, hence the same global energy flux and, by definition, the same\ntotal energy dissipation rate. The simulations reveal that changes in mean and\nturbulent energy dissipation rates can be of either sign in a successfully\ncontrolled flow.\n  A quantitative description of these changes is made possible by a new\ndecomposition of the total dissipation, stemming from an extended Reynolds\ndecomposition, where the mean velocity is split into a laminar component and a\ndeviation from it. Thanks to the analytical expressions of the laminar\nquantities, exact relationships are derived that link the achieved flow rate\nincrease and all energy fluxes in the flow system with two wall-normal\nintegrals of the Reynolds shear stress and the Reynolds number. The dependence\nof the energy fluxes on the Reynolds number is elucidated with a simple model\nin which the control-dependent changes of the Reynolds shear stress are\naccounted for via a modification of the mean velocity profile.

In this paper, we introduce\nIoTDots, a novel digital forensic framework for a smart environment such as\nsmart homes and smart offices. IoTDots has two main components:\nIoTDots-Modifier and IoTDots-Analyzer. At compile time, IoTDots-Modifier\nperforms the source code analysis of smart apps, detects forensically-relevant\ninformation, and automatically insert tracing logs. Then, at runtime, the logs\nare stored into a IoTDots database.

In order to test the performance of IoTDots, we tested\nIoTDots in a realistic smart office environment with a total of 22 devices and\nsensors. The evaluation results show that IoTDots can achieve, on average, over\n98% of accuracy on detecting user activities and over 96% accuracy on detecting\nthe behavior of users, devices, and apps in a smart environment.

We obtain estimates of the rate of reaction and binding energy for all\nthe three systems and those agree well with the previous experimental results\nfor the insulin dimer dissociation in water.

By changing the inclination angle ($\\beta$) of the convection\ncell, the character of the flow can be changed from moderately turbulent, for\n$\\beta = 0^o$, to laminar and steady at $\\beta = 90^o$. The global heat\ntransfer is found to be insensitive to the drastic reduction of turbulent\nintensity, with maximal relative variations of the order of $20\\%$ at $Ra\n\\simeq 10^{8}$ and $10\\%$ at $Ra \\simeq 5 \\times 10^{8}$, while the Reynolds\nnumber, based on the global root-mean- square velocity, is strongly affected\nwith a decay of more than $85\\%$ occurring in the laminar regime. We show that\nthe intensity of the heat flux in the turbulent regime can be only weakly\nenhanced by establishing a large scale circulation flow by means of small\ninclinations. On the other hand, in the laminar regime the heat is transported\nsolely by a slow large scale circulation flow which exhibits large correlations\nbetween the velocity and temperature fields. For inclination angles close to\nthe transition regime in-between the turbulent-like and laminar state, a\nquasi-periodic heat-flow bursting phenomenon is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 08:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

To date,\nmost of the existing works focus on the scenario of one source domain and one\ntarget domain (1S1T), and just a few works concern the scenario of multiple\nsource domains and one target domain (mS1T). While, to the best of our\nknowledge, almost no work concerns the scenario of one source domain and\nmultiple target domains (1SmT), in which these unlabeled target domains may not\nnecessarily share the same categories, therefore, contrasting to mS1T, 1SmT is\nmore challenging. Accordingly, for such a new UDA scenario, we propose a UDA\nframework through the model parameter adaptation (PA-1SmT). A key ingredient of\nPA-1SmT is to transfer knowledge through adaptive learning of a common model\nparameter dictionary, which is completely different from existing popular\nmethods for UDA, such as subspace alignment, distribution matching etc., and\ncan also be directly used for DA of privacy protection due to the fact that the\nknowledge is transferred just via the model parameters rather than data itself.\nFinally, our experimental results on three domain adaptation benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 09:18:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 07:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

Electron beams\ninteract with Langmuir waves resulting in type III radio bursts. Electron beams\nexpand along the trajectory, and using kinetic simulations, we explore the\nexpansion as the electrons propagate away from the Sun. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the front, peak and back of the electron beam in space from derived\nradio brightness temperatures of fundamental type III emission. The front of\nthe electron beams travelled at speeds from 0.2c--0.7c, significantly faster\nthan the back of the beam that travelled between 0.12c--0.35c. The difference\nin speed between the front and the back elongates the electron beams in time.\nThe rate of beam elongation has a 0.98 correlation coefficient with the peak\nvelocity; in-line with predictions from type III observations. The inferred\nspeeds of electron beams initially increase close to the acceleration region\nand then decrease through the solar corona. Larger starting densities and\nharder initial spectral indices result in longer and faster type III sources.\nFaster electron beams have higher beam energy densities, produce type IIIs with\nhigher peak brightness temperatures and shorter FWHM durations. Higher\nbackground plasma temperatures also increase speeds, particularly at the back\nof the beam. We show how our predictions of electron beam evolution influences\ntype III bandwidth and drift-rates. Our radial predictions of electron beam\nspeed and expansion can be tested by the upcoming in situ electron beam\nmeasurements made by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 10:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

FWI is highly nonlinear when the\nwave-equation constraint is enforced at each iteration. To mitigate\nnonlinearity, wavefield-reconstruction inversion (WRI) expands the search space\nby relaxing the wave-equation constraint with a penalty method. The pitfall of\nthis approach resides in the tuning of the penalty parameter because increasing\nvalues should be used to foster data fitting during early iterations while\nprogressively enforcing the wave-equation constraint during late iterations.\nHowever, large values of penalty parameter lead to ill-conditioned problems.\nHere, this tuning issue is solved by replacing the penalty method by an\naugmented Lagrangian method equipped with operator splitting (IR-WRI as\niteratively-refined WRI). It is shown that IR-WRI is similar to a penalty\nmethod in which data and sources are updated at each iteration by the running\nsum of the data and source residuals of previous iterations. Moreover, the\nalternating direction strategy exploits the bilinearity of the wave equation\nconstraint to linearize the subsurface model estimation around the\nreconstructed wavefield. Accordingly, the original nonlinear FWI is decomposed\ninto a sequence of two linear subproblems, the optimization variable of one\nsubproblem being passed as a passive variable for the next subproblem. The\nconvergence of WRI and IR-WRI are first compared with a simple transmission\nexperiment, which lies in the linear regime of FWI. Under the same conditions,\nIR-WRI converges to a more accurate minimizer with a smaller number of\niterations than WRI. More realistic case studies performed with the Marmousi II\nand the BP salt models show the resilience of IR-WRI to cycle skipping and\nnoise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 11:06:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 13:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

The contribution of quiet-Sun regions to the solar irradiance\nvariability is currently unclear. Some solar-cycle variations of the quiet-Sun\nphysical structure, such as the temperature gradient, might affect the\nirradiance. The synoptic measurement of this quantity along the activity cycle\nwould improve our understanding of long-term irradiance variations. Aims. We\nintend to test a method previously introduced for measuring the photospheric\ntemperature gradient from high-resolution spectroscopic observation and to\nstudy its feasibility with ground-based instruments with and without adaptative\noptics. Methods. We used synthetic profiles of the FeI 630.15 nm obtained from\nrealistic three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the photospheric\ngranulation and line radiative transfer computations under local\nthermodynamical equilibrium conditions. Synthetic granulation images at\ndifferent levels in the line are obtained by convolution with the instrumental\npoint spread function (PSF) under various conditions of atmospheric turbulence,\nwith and without correction by an adaptative optics (AO) system. The PSF are\nobtained with the PAOLA software, and the AO performances are inspired by the\nsystem that will be operating on the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. Results.\nWe consider two different conditions of atmospheric turbulence, with Fried\nparameters of 7 cm and 5 cm, respectively. We show that the degraded images\nlead to both a bias and a loss of precision in the temperature-gradient\nmeasurement, and that the correction with the AO system allows us to\ndrastically improve the measurement quality.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a highly conserved peptide\nthat appears to play a central role in nociceptive signaling in inflammatory\nand neuropathic pain. However, little is known about the peptide in\ncancer-induced bone pain. Here, we evaluate the role of spinal NPY in the\nMRMT-1 rat model of cancer-induced bone pain. Our studies revealed an\nup-regulation of NPY-immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of cancer-bearing rats\n17 days after inoculation, which could be a compensatory antinociceptive\nresponse. Consistent with this interpretation, intrathecal administration of\nNPY to rats with cancer-induced bone pain caused a reduction in nociceptive\nbehaviors that lasted up to 150 min. This effect was diminished by both Y1\n(BIBO3304) and Y2 (BIIE0246) receptor antagonists, indicating that both\nreceptors participate in mediating the antinociceptive effect of NPY. Y1 and Y2\nreceptor binding in the spinal cord was unchanged in the cancer state as\ncompared to sham-operated rats, consistent with the notion that increased NPY\nresults in a net antinociceptive effect in the MRMT-1 model. In conclusion, the\ndata indicate that NPY is involved in the spinal nociceptive signaling of\ncancer-induced bone pain and could be a new therapeutic target for patients\nwith this condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 11:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-10"}

The kinematic coverage at STAR allows accessing gluons because\nquark-gluon and gluon-gluon scatterings dominate particle production at low and\nmedium transverse momenta. The polarized gluon distribution function can be\nconstrained by measuring the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry ($A_{LL}$) of\njet production and neutral pions. Global QCD analyses of polarized parton\ndistribution functions, which include the 2009 $A_{LL}$ STAR results for\ninclusive jet production at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV, provide evidence of a non-zero\ngluon polarization in the measured range of partonic momentum fraction $x >\n0.05$. We present the status of the latest measurements of $A_{LL}$ at STAR,\nfor inclusive jet and dijet production at $\\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV and 200 GeV\ncollected in 2013 and 2015 respectively, both at mid-rapidity ($|\\eta|<0.9$).\nThe large data sample taken during these years will improve the precision of\nour knowledge about the proton spin structure while the increased center of\nmass energy allows probing the polarized gluon distribution function at smaller\npartonic momentum fraction.

We subsequently detected pulsations from the pulsar in the interferometric\nimages of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, allowing for sub-arcsecond\nlocalization. This, along with a pre-discovery detection 2 years prior, allowed\nus to measure the spin-period derivative to be $\\dot{P}=2.7 \\times 10^{-14}$ s\ns$^{-1}$.

The picture emerging from these different data\nsets is complex. Flux-conservative algorithms images clearly show the disk up\nto 200au. More aggressive algorithms reveal several rings and warped arms\noverlapping the main disk. The bright parts of this ring lie at considerable\nheight over the disk mid-plane at about 30au.

Actuating helical magnetic materials with a\nhomogeneous rotating magnetic field is one of the most widespread techniques\nfor propulsion at the microscale, partly because the actuation strategy\nrevolves around a simple linear relationship between the actuating field\nfrequency and the propeller velocity. However, the full control of the\nswimmers' motion has remained a challenge. Increasing the controllability of\nmicropropellers is crucial to achieve complex actuation schemes that in turn\nare directly relevant for numerous applications. The simplicity of the linear\nrelationship though limits the possibilities and flexibilities of swarm\ncontrol. Using a pool of randomly-shaped magnetic microswimmers, we show that\nthe complexity of shape can advantageously be translated into enhanced control.\nIn particular, directional reversal of sorted micropropellers is controlled by\nthe frequency of the actuating field. This directionality change is linked to\nthe balance between magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. We further show an\nexample how this behavior can experimentally lead to simple and effective\nsorting of individual swimmers from a group.

So far mostly single RM\nobservations have been used to estimate the spin-orbit angle, and thus there\nhave been no studies regarding the variation of estimated spin-orbit angle from\ntransit to transit. Stellar activity can alter the shape of photometric transit\nlight curves and in a similar way they can deform the RM signal. In this paper\nwe discuss several RM observations, obtained using the HARPS spectrograph, of\nknown transiting planets that all transit extremely active stars, and by\nanalyzing them individually we assess the variation in the estimated spin-orbit\nangle. Our results reveal that the estimated spin-orbit angle can vary\nsignificantly (up to 42 degrees) from transit to transit, due to variation in\nthe configuration of stellar active regions over different nights. This finding\nis almost two times larger than the expected variation predicted from\nsimulations. We could not identify any meaningful correlation between the\nvariation of estimated spin-orbit angles and the stellar magnetic activity\nindicators. We also investigated two possible approaches to mitigate the\nstellar activity influence on RM observations. The first strategy was based on\nobtaining several RM observations and folding them to reduce the stellar\nactivity noise. Our results demonstrated that this is a feasible and robust way\nto overcome this issue. The second approach is based on acquiring simultaneous\nhigh-precision short-cadence photometric transit light curves using\nTRAPPIST/SPECULOOS telescopes, which provide more information about the stellar\nactive region's properties and allow a better RM modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 14:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

We vary the\nvalue of the velocity gradient induced by the shear and the initial value of\nthe galactic magnetic field. Finally the different star formation rates and the\nproperties of the structures associated with this set of simulations are\ncomputed. We first confirm that the feedback has a strong limiting effect on\nstar formation. The galactic shear has also a great influence: the higher the\nshear, the lower the SFR. Taking the value of the velocity gradient in the\nsolar neighbourhood, the SFR is too high compared to the observed Kennicutt\nlaw, by a factor approximately three to six. This discrepancy can be solved by\narguing that the relevant value of the shear is not the one in the solar\nneighbourhood, and that in reality the star formation efficiency within\nclusters is not 100%. Taking into account the fact that star-forming clouds\ngenerally lie in spiral arms where the shear can be substantially higher (as\nprobed by galaxy-scale simulations), the SFR is now close to the observed one.\nDifferent numerical recipes have been tested for the sink particles, giving a\nnumerical incertitude of a factor of about two on the SFR. Finally we have also\nestimated the velocity dispersions in our dense clouds and found that they lie\nbelow the observed Larson law by a factor of about two. Conclusions. In our\nsimulations, magnetic field, shear, HII regions, and supernovae all contribute\nsignificantly to reduce the SFR.

Using these results and knowing\nthe parameterizations of surface friction and thermal radiation in Held-Suarez\nphysics, the contribution of each physical process (meridional and vertical\neddy fluxes, surface friction, thermal radiation, and meridional advection) to\nthe annular mode dynamics is quantified. Examining the quasi-geostrophic\npotential vorticity balance, it is shown that the eddy feedback is positive and\nincreases the persistence of the annular mode by a factor of more than two.\nFurthermore, how eddy fluxes change in response to only the barotropic\ncomponent of the annular mode, i.e., vertically averaged zonal wind (and no\ntemperature) anomaly, is also calculated similarly. The response of eddy fluxes\nto the barotropic-only component of the annular mode is found to be drastically\ndifferent from the response to the full (barotropic+baroclinic) annular mode\nanomaly. In the former, the barotropic governor effect significantly suppresses\nthe eddy generation leading to a negative eddy feedback that decreases the\npersistence of the annular mode by nearly a factor of three. These results\nsuggest that the baroclinic component of the annular mode anomaly, i.e., the\nincreased low-level baroclinicity, is essential for the persistence of the\nannular mode, consistent with the baroclinic mechanism but not the barotropic\nmechanism proposed in the previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 15:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

Here, we\nconduct a first-principles high-throughput study on more than 4000\nsemiconductors (with a special focus on oxides). Our data confirm the general\ninverse trend between refractive index and band gap but interesting outliers\nare also identified. The data are then analyzed through a simple model\ninvolving two main descriptors: the average optical gap and the effective\nfrequency. The former can be determined directly from the electronic structure\nof the compounds, but the latter cannot. This calls for further analysis in\norder to obtain a predictive model. Nonetheless, it turns out that the negative\neffect of a large band gap on the refractive index can counterbalanced in two\nways: (i) by limiting the difference between the direct band gap and the\naverage optical gap which can be realized by a narrow distribution in energy of\nthe optical transitions and (ii) by increasing the effective frequency which\ncan be achieved through either a high number of transitions from the top of the\nvalence band to the bottom of the conduction or a high average probability for\nthese transitions.\n  Focusing on oxides, we use our data to investigate how the chemistry\ninfluences this inverse relationship and rationalize why certain classes of\nmaterials would perform better.

The AOD retrievals were validated\nagainst 20 AERONET sites, and the results show that the R for DT retrievals in\nC6.1 is 0.946, while the fraction within the EE can be considered relatively\nlow at only 54.03%. DB retrievals in C6.1 have a slightly lower R value, but\nthe other criteria are superior to DT. Comparing the results over urban and\nvegetation areas in C6.1, the overall quality of the DB retrievals is better\nthan the DT retrievals in urban areas. The performance of DT is significantly\nsuperior to DB in the LEV areas. For the HEV areas, DB performs synthetically\nbetter than DT.

Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton\n(EMd) theory is an exception: through couplings both to electromagnetism and\n(non-minimally) to gravity, a massless scalar field can be generated by an\nelectrically charged BH. In this work, we analytically model the dynamics of\nbinaries comprised of such scalar-charged (\"hairy\") BHs. While BHs are not\nexpected to have substantial electric charge within the Standard Model of\nparticle physics, nearly-extremally charged BHs could occur in models of\nminicharged dark matter and dark photons. We begin by studying the test-body\nlimit for a binary BH in EMd theory, and we argue that only very compact\nbinaries of nearly-extremally charged BHs can manifest non-perturbative\nphenomena similar to those found in certain scalar-tensor theories. Then, we\nuse the post-Newtonian approximation to study the dynamics of binary BHs with\narbitrary mass ratios.

For the case of uniform hopping for all\nbonds, where it is known that an ideal conductor to insulator transition takes\nplace at finite interaction, we also find a transition at an interaction\nstrength somewhat lower than the known value. The ideal conductor phase is a\nFermi sea. The phase diagram in the whole parameter range shows a resemblance\nto the phase diagram of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. We also calculate the\ngauge invariant cumulants corresponding to the polarization (Zak phase) and use\nthese to reconstruct the distribution of the polarization. We calculate the\nreconstructed polarization distribution along a path in parameter space which\nconnects two points with opposite polarization in two ways.
