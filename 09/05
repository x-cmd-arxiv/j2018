Two infrasound microphones with\na 59-m separation and a regional Doppler radar station were located 18.7 km and\n70 km from the tornado, respectively. Elevated infrasound levels were observed\nstarting 7 minutes before the verified tornado. Infrasound data below ~5 Hz was\ncontaminated with wind noise, but in the 5-50 Hz band the infrasound was\nindependent of wind speed with a bearing angle that was consistent with the\nmovement of the storm core that produced the tornado. During the tornado, a 75\ndB peak formed at ~8.3 Hz, which was 18 dB above pre-tornado levels. This\nfundamental frequency had overtones (18, 29, 36, and 44 Hz) that were linearly\nrelated to mode number. Analysis of a larger period of time associated with two\ninfrasound bursts (the tornado occurred during the first event) shows that the\nspectral peaks from the tornado were present from 4 minutes before to 40\nminutes after tornadogenesis. This suggests that the same geophysical\nprocess(es) was active during this entire window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 16:13:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 18:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

The goal is to derive a model with guaranteed simulation error\nbounds for all predicted time steps, up to a finite horizon of choice. This is\nachieved in three steps. At first, the noise bound, system order, and impulse\nresponse decay rate are estimated from data. Then, the estimated quantities are\nused to refine the sets of all possible multi-step predictors compatible with\ndata and prior assumptions (Feasible Parameter Sets, FPSs). The FPSs allow one\nto derive, in a Set Membership framework, guaranteed error bounds for any given\nmulti-step predictor, including the one obtained by simulating the system\nmodel. Finally, the wanted model parameters are identified by numerical\noptimization, imposing the constraints provided by the FPSs and using one of\ntwo proposed optimality criteria, namely to minimize the worst-case error bound\nover the considered simulation horizon, or to minimize a standard simulation\nerror criterion.

To cope with the increased path loss, mmWave links\nrequire directional antennas that should be able to direct their beams to\ndifferent neighbors, to dynamically change the BH topology, in case new nodes\nare powered on/off or the traffic demand has changed. Such BH adaptation needs\nto be orchestrated to minimize the impact on existing traffic. This paper\ndevelops a Software-defined networking-based framework that guides the optimal\nreconfiguration of mesh BH networks composed by mmWave links, where antennas\nneed to be mechanically aligned. By modelling the problem as a Mixed Integer\nLinear Program (MILP), its solution returns the optimal ordering of events\nnecessary to transition between two BH network configurations.

A numerical evaluation with different topologies and traffic\ndemands shows that increasing the number of BH interfaces per SC from 2 to 4\ncan decrease the total loss by more than 50%. Moreover, when increasing the\ntotal reconfiguration time, additional backup paths can be created,\nconsequently reducing the reconfiguration impact on existing traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 16:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

It will be shown that such correction has profound\ncontributions to high energy limit of thermodynamical quantities, stability\nconditions of the black holes and interestingly has no effect on\nthermodynamical phase transitions. The coupling between gravity's rainbow and\nthe first-order correction will be addressed. In addition, the measurement of\nentropy as a function of fluctuation of temperature will be done and it will be\nshown that de Sitter (dS) case enforces an upper limit on the values of\ntemperature and produces cyclic like diagrams. While for the anti-de Sitter\n(AdS) case, a lower limit on the entropy is provided and although for special\ncases a cyclic like behavior could be observed, no upper or lower limit exists\nfor the temperature.

In our observations, the disk of HD 143006 is\nclearly resolved up to ~0.5\" and shows a clear large-scale asymmetry with the\neastern side brighter than the western side. We detect a number of additional\nfeatures, including two gaps and a ring. The ring shows an overbrightness at a\nposition angle (PA) of ~140 deg, extending over a range in position angle of\n~60 deg, and two narrow dark regions. The two narrow dark lanes and the overall\nlarge-scale asymmetry are indicative of shadowing effects, likely due to a\nmisaligned inner disk.

The warped disk model, based on the\nhydrodynamic simulations combined with 3D radiative transfer calculations,\nreproduces all major morphological features. However, it does not account for\nthe observed overbrightness at PA~140 deg. Shadows have been detected in\nseveral protoplanetary disks, suggesting that misalignment in disks is not\nuncommon.

We extracted radial profiles in the 1.5-8 keV range from various\nsectors around the synchrotron shell and fitted these with a projected and\npoint spread function convolved postshock volumetric emissivity model to\ndetermine the filament widths. We then calculated the postshock magnetic field\nstrength from these widths. We found that most of the sectors were well fitted\nwith our postshock model and the determined $B$-field values were low, all with\nbest fits $\\lesssim 20~\\mu$G. Upper limits on the confidence intervals of three\nsectors reached $\\gtrsim 30~\\mu$G though these were poorly constrained. The\ngenerally low $B$-field values suggests a leptonic-dominated origin for the TeV\n$\\gamma$-rays. Our postshock model did not provide adequate fits to two\nsectors.

The interstellar\nmedium is highly compressible, as the turbulence is transonic or supersonic; it\nis thus an excellent context in which to explore the use of smoothing to\nrepresent physical variables in a compressible medium in terms of their mean\nand fluctuating parts. Unlike alternative averaging procedures, such as\nhorizontal averaging, Gaussian smoothing retains the three-dimensional\nstructure of the mean fields.

This internal motion attenuates at exponentially long time\nscales. As a result, in a broad range of frequencies the liquid is described by\ntwo-fluid hydrodynamics, and the system supports two sound modes. The physical\nnature of the two sounds depends on whether the particles forming the quantum\nliquid have a spin degree of freedom. For particles with spin, the modes are\nanalogous to the first and second sound modes in superfluid $^4$He, which are\nthe waves of density and entropy, respectively. When dissipative processes are\ntaken into account, we find that at low frequencies the second sound is\ntransformed into heat diffusion, while the first sound mode remains weakly\ndamped and becomes the ordinary sound. In a spinless liquid the entropy and\ndensity oscillations are strongly coupled, and the resulting sound modes are\nhybrids of the first and second sound. As the frequency is lowered and\ndissipation processes become important, the crossover to single-fluid regime\noccurs in two steps. First the hybrid modes transform into predominantly\ndensity and entropy waves, similar to the first and second sound, and then the\ndensity wave transforms to the ordinary sound and the entropy wave becomes a\nheat diffusion mode. Finally, we account for the dissipation due to viscosity\nand intrinsic thermal conductivity of the gas of excitations, which controls\nattenuation of the sound modes at high frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 17:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

This model\nassumes that central galaxies are quenched by AGN feedback when hot halo gas\naccretes onto a supermassive black hole. Nevertheless, we find that supernova\n(SN) feedback sets both mass scales. As haloes grow above a threshold mass, SNe\ncan no longer eject material so their hot gas content increases, enhancing the\ncooling rate onto the central galaxy, its cold gas content, its star formation\nrate and the growth rate of its central black hole.

The inner spheroid of NGC 3311 can be\ndescribed as a slow rotator. Outside 10 kpc the cumulative angular momentum is\nrising. If the radial dependence alone is considered, the velocity dispersion\ndoes not simply rise but fills an increasingly large range of values with two\nwell defined envelopes. The lower envelope is about constant at 200 km/s. The\nupper envelope rises smoothly, joining the velocity dispersion of the outer\ncluster galaxies. We interpret this behaviour as the superposition of tracer\npopulations with increasingly shallower radial distributions between the\nextremes of the inner stellar populations and the cluster galaxies. Simple\nJeans models illustrate that a range of of mass profiles with different\nanisotropies can account for all observed velocity dispersions, including\nradial MOND models.

The power-law slope is harder for higher\nmagnetizations and stronger turbulence levels. In large systems, the slope\nattains an asymptotic, system-size-independent value, while the high-energy\nspectral cutoff increases linearly with system size; both the slope and the\ncutoff do not depend on the dimensionality of our domain. By following a large\nsample of particles, we show that particle injection happens at reconnecting\ncurrent sheets; the injected particles are then further accelerated by\nstochastic interactions with turbulent fluctuations. Our results have important\nimplications for the origin of non-thermal particles in high-energy\nastrophysical sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 18:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

We illustrate this on examples of the interactions\namong damped radiation modes in an optomechanical three-mode system. By\nassuming that one of the modes undergoes fast dissipation, we show that the\ncoupling of that mode to one or two other modes of the system may result in\none- or two-way quantum steering. Explicit analytical results are given for the\nsteering parameters. We find that two modes coupled by the parametric-type\ninteraction and damped with the same rates can be entangled but cannot exhibit\nquantum steering. When, in addition, one of the modes is coupled to a fast\ndamped mode, steering correlations are created and the modes then exhibit\none-way steering. The creation of the steering correlations is interpreted in\nthe context of the variances of the quadrature components of the modes that the\nsteering correlations result from an asymmetry in the variances of the\nquadrature components of the modes induced by the auxiliary mode. It is found\nthat the fluctuations act directionally that quantum steering may occur only\nwhen the variance of the steering mode is larger that the variance of the\nsteered mode.

Recent advances in the theory of\ndissipative vortices, experimental studies, and anatomically realistic computer\nsimulations, elucidated the role of cardiac re-entry interaction with fine\nanatomical features in the heart, and anatomy induced drift. The fact that\nanatomy and structural anisotropy of the heart is consistent within a species\nsuggested its possible functional effect on spontaneous drift of cardiac\nre-entry.

The MAGNUM survey aims at overcoming these limitations by focusing\non the nearest AGN, including NGC 1365, a nearby Seyfert galaxy (D~17 Mpc),\nhosting a low-luminosity AGN (Lbol ~ 2x10^43 erg/s). We want to obtain a\ndetailed picture of the ionized gas in the central ~5 kpc of NGC 1365 in terms\nof physical properties, kinematics, and ionization mechanisms. We also aim to\ncharacterize the warm ionized outflow as a function of distance from the\nnucleus and its relation with the nuclear X-ray wind. We employed VLT/MUSE\noptical integral field spectroscopic observations to investigate the warm\nionized gas and Chandra ACIS-S X-ray data for the hot highly-ionized phase. We\nobtained flux, kinematic, and diagnostic maps of the optical emission lines,\nwhich we used to disentangle outflows from disk motions and measure the gas\nproperties down to a spatial resolution of ~70 pc.

H{\\alpha} emission traces instead star formation in a circumnuclear ring\nand along the bar, where we detect non-circular motions. Soft X-rays are mostly\ndue to thermal emission from the star-forming regions, but we could isolate the\nAGN photoionized component which matches the [OIII] emission. The mass outflow\nrate of the extended ionized outflow matches that of the nuclear X-ray wind and\nthen decreases with radius. However, the hard X-ray emission from the\ncircumnuclear ring suggests that star formation might contribute to the\noutflow. The integrated mass outflow rate, kinetic energy rate, and outflow\nvelocity are broadly consistent with the typical relations observed in more\nluminous AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 19:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

To reveal this multi-scale nature, we proposed\njump-diffusion approximation in a previous study. The key idea behind the model\nwas to partition reactions into fast and slow groups, and then to combine\nMarkov chain updating scheme for the slow set with diffusion (Langevin)\napproach updating scheme for the fast set. Then, the state vector of the model\nwas defined as the summation of the random time change model and the solution\nof the Langevin equation.

The compiler automatically\ngenerates custom instructions in the security critical segments of the program,\nand the instructions execute on the RISC-V custom co-processor to produce\ndiversified timing characteristics on each execution instance. CIDPro has been\nimplemented on the Zynq7000 XC7Z020 FPGA device to study the performance\noverhead and security tradeoffs. Experimental results show that our solution\ncan achieve 80% and 86% timing side-channel capacity reduction for two\nbenchmarks with an acceptable performance overhead compared to existing\nsolutions.

This is explained by either speculating that\nFGs are failed groups that formed without bright satellite galaxies and did not\nsuffer any major merger, or by suggesting that FGs are very old systems that\nhad enough time to exhaust their bright satellite galaxies through multiple\nmajor mergers. Since major mergers leave signatures in the stellar populations\nof the resulting galaxy, we study the stellar population parameters of the\nbrightest central galaxies (BCGs) of FGs as a benchmark against which the\nformation and evolution scenarios of FGs can be compared.

In\naddition, iterative backtranslation improves results further, yielding, for\ninstance, 14.08 and 26.22 BLEU points in WMT 2014 English-German and\nEnglish-French, respectively, an improvement of more than 7-10 BLEU points over\nprevious unsupervised systems, and closing the gap with supervised SMT (Moses\ntrained on Europarl) down to 2-5 BLEU points. Our implementation is available\nat https://github.com/artetxem/monoses\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 23:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

For a\ntwo-setting, two-outcome Bell test, we derive modified Bell inequalities that\nrelax measurement independence, for either or both observers, while remaining\nlocally causal. We describe the loss of measurement independence for each\nobserver using the parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$, as defined by Hall in 2010, and\nalso by a more complete description that adds two new parameters, which we call\n$\\hat{M}_1$ and $\\hat{M}_2$, deriving a modified Bell inequality for each\ndescription. These \"relaxed\" inequalities subsume those considered in previous\nwork as special cases, and quantify how much the assumption of measurement\nindependence needs to be relaxed in order for a locally causal model to produce\na given violation of the standard Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH)\ninequality. We show that both relaxed Bell inequalities are tight bounds on the\nCHSH parameter by constructing locally causal models that saturate them. For\nany given Bell inequality violation, the new two-parameter and four-parameter\nmodels each require significantly less mutual information between the hidden\nvariables and measurement settings than previous models. We conjecture that the\nnew models, with optimal parameters, require the minimum possible mutual\ninformation for a given Bell violation. We further argue that, contrary to\nvarious claims in the literature, relaxing freedom of choice need not imply\nsuperdeterminism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 03:20:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

So, in this regard, a monitor platform which can obtain the\naccurate location information of the surgery room is desperately needed.\nCompared to 2D camera image, 3D data contains more information of distance and\ndirection. Therefore, 3D sensors are more suitable to be used in surgical scene\nmonitoring. However, each 3D sensor has its own limitations. For example, Lidar\n(Light Detection and Ranging) can detect large-scale environment with high\nprecision, but the point clouds or depth maps are very sparse. As for commodity\nRGBD sensors, such as Kinect, can accurately capture denser data, but limited\nto a small range from 0.5 to 4.5m.

The definition of \"probability of presence\" is\nincompatible between the two. So, we take issue with modeling strategies in the\nliterature which ignore this incompatibility, which assume that\npresence/absence modeling can be induced from presence-only specifications and\ntherefore, that fusion of presence-only and presence/absence data sources is\nroutine.

A Markov\nChain Monte Carlo calculation provides a best-fit single power-law function to\nthe first ten epochs of photometry described by an exponent of\n$2.16^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and a time of first light of MJD\n56629.4$^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, which is $1.93^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ days (i.e., $<48$~hr)\nbefore the discovery date (2013 December 4.84 UT) and $-19.10^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$\ndays before the time of $B$-band maximum (MJD 56648.5$\\pm0.1$). The estimate of\nthe time of first light is consistent with the explosion time inferred from the\nevolution of the Si II $\\lambda$6355 Doppler velocity. Furthermore, discovery\nphotometry and previous nondetection limits enable us to constrain the\ncompanion radius down to $R_c \\leq 4\\,R_{\\odot}$.

At the grain-scale, a gas-solid\ncoupling heat transfer model is adapted into a discrete-element-method to\nsimulate this transport phenomenon. The numerical framework is validated by\nexperimental data obtained using a plane source technique, and the\nSmoluschowski effect of the gas phase is found to be captured by this\nextension. By considering packings of spherical SiO2 grains with an\ninterstitial helium phase, vibration induced ordering in granular media is\nstudied, using the simulation methods developed here, to investigate how\ndisorder-to-order transitions of packing structure enhance effective thermal\nconductivity. Grain-scale thermal transport is shown to be influenced by the\nlocal neighbourhood configuration of individual grains. The formation of an\nordered packing structure enhances both global and local thermal transport.\nThis study provides a structure approach to explain transport phenomena, which\ncan be applied in properties modification for granular media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 08:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

Here, we explore differences in estimating the\ninner edge among seven one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer models: two\nline-by-line codes (SMART and LBLRTM) as well as five band codes (CAM3,\nCAM4_Wolf, LMDG, SBDART, and AM2) that are currently being used in global\nclimate models. We compare radiative fluxes and spectra in clear-sky conditions\naround G- and M-stars, with fixed moist adiabatic profiles for surface\ntemperatures from 250 to 360 K. We find that divergences among the models arise\nmainly from large uncertainties in water vapor absorption in the window region\n(10 um) and in the region between 0.2 and 1.5 um. Differences in outgoing\nlongwave radiation increase with surface temperature and reach 10-20 Wm^-2;\ndifferences in shortwave reach up to 60 Wm^-2, especially at the surface and in\nthe troposphere, and are larger for an M-dwarf spectrum than a solar spectrum.\nDifferences between the two line-by-line models are significant, although\nsmaller than among the band models. Our results imply that the uncertainty in\nestimating the insolation threshold of the inner edge (the runaway greenhouse\nlimit) due only to clear-sky radiative transfer is ~10% of modern Earth's solar\nconstant (i.e., ~34 Wm^-2 in global mean) among band models and ~3% between the\ntwo line-by-line models. These comparisons show that future work is needed\nfocusing on improving water vapor absorption coefficients in both shortwave and\nlongwave, as well as on increasing the resolution of stellar spectra in\nbroadband models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 09:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

Two iterative methods based on\ngraph database and PageRank are presented and their convergence are discussed.\nVertex contraction is proposed to improve the performance by eliminating\nzero-impedance branch.

An\nindividual observation allows measurement of the black-hole masses, but only\nlimited information about either the magnitude or orientation of the black hole\nspins is available, primarily due to the degeneracy between measurements of\nspin and binary mass ratio. Using the first six black-hole merger observations,\nwe are able to constrain the distribution of black-hole spins. We perform model\nselection between a set of models with different spin population models\ncombined with a power-law mass distribution to make inferences about the spin\ndistribution. We assume a fixed power-law mass distribution on the black holes,\nwhich is supported by the data and provides a realistic distribution of binary\nmass-ratio. This allows us to accurately account for selection effects due to\nvariations in the signal amplitude with spin magnitude, and provides an\nimproved inference on the spin distribution. We conclude that the first six\nLIGO and Virgo observations (Abbott et al. 2016a, 2017a,b,c) disfavour highly\nspinning black holes against low spins by an odds-ratio of 15:1; thus providing\nstrong constraints on spin magnitudes from gravitational-wave observations.\nFurthermore, we are able to rule out a population of binaries with completely\naligned spins, even when the spins of the individual black holes are low, at an\nodds ratio of 22,000:1, significantly strengthening earlier evidence against\naligned spins (Farr et al. 2017).

It provides a short introduction to general\nrelativity, which describes gravity in terms of the curvature of space-time,\nand examines the properties of black holes. These are central objects in\ngeneral relativity which arise when sufficient energy is compressed into a\nfinite volume, so that even light cannot escape its gravitational pull. We will\nsee that black holes exhibit a profound connection with thermodynamic systems.\nIndeed, by quantizing a field theory on curved backgrounds, one can show that\nblack holes emit thermal (Hawking) radiation, so that the connection with\nthermodynamics is more than a formal similarity. Hawking radiation gives rise\nto an apparent conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics known\nas the black hole information problem. If a black hole formed from a pure\nquantum state evaporates to form thermal radiation, which is in a mixed state,\nthen the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics is violated.

The\nstandard mechanism relies on the cavity photons directly modifying the state of\nthe mechanical resonator. Hybrid cavity optomechanics provides an alternative\napproach by coupling mechanical objects to quantum emitters, either directly or\nindirectly via the common interaction with a cavity field mode. While many\napproaches exist, they typically share a simple effective description in terms\nof a single force acting on the mechanical resonator. More generally, one can\nstudy the interplay between various forces acting on the mechanical resonator\nin such hybrid mechanical devices. This interplay can lead to interference\neffects that may, for instance, improve cooling of the mechanical motion or\nlead to generation of entanglement between various parts of the hybrid device.\nHere, we provide such an example of a hybrid optomechanical system where an\nensemble of quantum emitters is embedded into the mechanical resonator formed\nby a vibrating membrane.

Specifically, an IRS consists of a\nlarge number of low-cost passive elements each reflecting the incident signal\nwith a certain phase shift to collaboratively achieve beamforming and suppress\ninterference at one or more designated receivers. In this paper, we study an\nIRS-enhanced point-to-point multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system\nwhere one IRS is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna\naccess point (AP) to a single-antenna user. As a result, the user\nsimultaneously receives the signal sent directly from the AP as well as that\nreflected by the IRS. We aim to maximize the total received signal power at the\nuser by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the AP and\n(passive) reflect beamforming by the phase shifters at the IRS. We first\npropose a centralized algorithm based on the technique of semidefinite\nrelaxation (SDR) by assuming the global channel state information (CSI)\navailable at the IRS. Since the centralized implementation requires excessive\nchannel estimation and signal exchange overheads, we further propose a\nlow-complexity distributed algorithm where the AP and IRS independently adjust\nthe transmit beamforming and the phase shifts in an alternating manner until\nthe convergence is reached. Simulation results show that significant\nperformance gains can be achieved by the proposed algorithms as compared to\nbenchmark schemes. Moreover, it is verified that the IRS is able to drastically\nenhance the link quality and/or coverage over the conventional setup without\nthe IRS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 10:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 09:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

The model shows that observed\nsegregation can be the emergent result of people interacting under spatial\nconstraints in pursuit of such homophily preferences. Even mild homophily\npreferences can generate high degrees of segregation at the macro level. In\nmodern, ethnically diverse societies people might not define similarity based\non ethnicity. Instead, shared tolerance towards ethnic diversity might play a\nmore significant role, impacting segregation and integration patterns in\nsocieties. Bearing this consideration in mind, we extend Schelling's model by\ndividing the population of agents into value-oriented and ethnicity-oriented\nagents. Using parameter sweeping, we explore the consequences that the mutual\nadaptation of these two types of agents has on ethnic segregation, value\nsegregation, and population density in the neighborhood. Such consequences are\nexamined for equally sized ethnic groups and for majority-minority conditions.\nThe introduction of value-oriented agents reduces total ethnic segregation when\ncompared to Schelling's original model, but the new phenomenon of value\nsegregation appears to be more pronounced than ethnic segregation. Furthermore,\ndue to cross-contagion, stronger ethnic homophily preferences lead not only to\ngreater ethnic segregation but also to more value segregation. Stronger\nvalue-orientation of the tolerant agents similarly leads to increased ethnic\nsegregation of the ethnicity-oriented agents. Also, value-oriented agents tend\nto live in neighborhoods with more agents than ethnicity-oriented agents. In\nmajority-minority settings, such effects appear to be more drastic for the\nminority than the majority ethnicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 11:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

One of the key ideas\ndeveloped here is to define a range-separation parameter which automatically\nadapts to a given basis set. The derivation of the exact equations are based on\nthe Levy-Lieb formulation of DFT, which helps us to define a complementary\nfunctional which corrects uniquely for the basis-set error of WFT. The coupling\nof DFT and WFT is done through the definition of a real-space representation of\nthe electron-electron Coulomb operator projected in a one-particle basis set.\nSuch an effective interaction has the particularity to coincide with the exact\nelectron-electron interaction in the limit of a complete basis set, and to be\nfinite at the electron-electron coalescence point when the basis set is\nincomplete. The non-diverging character of the effective interaction allows one\nto define a mapping with the long-range interaction used in the context of\nrange-separated DFT and to design practical approximations for the unknown\ncomplementary functional. Here, a local-density approximation is proposed for\nboth full-configuration-interaction (FCI) and selected\nconfiguration-interaction approaches. Our theory is numerically tested to\ncompute total energies and ionization potentials for a series of atomic\nsystems. The results clearly show that the DFT correction drastically improves\nthe basis-set convergence of both the total energies and the energy\ndifferences. For instance, a sub kcal/mol accuracy is obtained from the\naug-cc-pVTZ basis set with the method proposed here when an aug-cc-pV5Z basis\nset barely reaches such a level of accuracy at the near FCI level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 12:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

As the dark energy includes\nthe effects of the electroweak symmetry breaking and the QCD chiral symmetry\nbreaking, if the dS swampland conjecture is applicable for the low energy\nquintessence potential, it can be applied for the Higgs and pion potential\nalso. On the other hand, the Higgs and pion potential has the well-known dS\nextrema, and applying the dS swampland conjecture to those dS extrema may\nprovide stringent constraints on the viable quintessence, as well as on the\nconjecture itself.

However, the models presented so far in the\nliterature are limited in a number of regards, and more insights are required\nfrom either laboratory experiments or fieldwork for these models to be\nvalidated and improved. Unfortunately, performing detailed measurements of wave\npropagation in grease ice, either on the field or in the laboratory, is\nchallenging. As a consequence, laboratory data are relatively scarce, and often\nconsist of only a couple of wave elevation measurements along the length of the\nwave tank. We present combined measurements of wave elevation using an array of\nultrasonic probes, and water kinematics using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV),\nin a small-scale wave tank experiment. Experiments are performed over a wider\nfrequency range than what has been previously investigated. The wave elevation\nmeasurements are used to compute the wave number and exponential damping\ncoefficient. By contrast with a previous study in grease ice, we find that the\nwave number is consistent with the mass loading model, i.e. it increases\ncompared with the open water case. Wave attenuation is compared with a series\nof one-layer models, and we show that they satisfactorily describe the viscous\ndamping that is taking place. PIV data are also consistent with exponential\nwave amplitude attenuation, and a POD analysis reveals the existence of mean\nflows under the ice that are a consequence of the displacement and packing of\nthe ice induced by the gradient in the wave-induced stress. Finally, we show\nthat the dynamics of grease ice can generate eddy structures that inject eddy\nviscosity in the water under the grease ice, which would lead to enhanced\nmixing and participating in energy dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 13:13:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 09:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

[1]) the presence of dark energy in our universe\nwas explained as the fingerprint of a comprehensive, much older and expanding\nmultiverse with positive spatial curvature, whose space-time is spanned by this\nenergy, and which was created out of nothing. This concept is expanded by the\naddition of a model for explaining the decay of the mass density $\\varrho$ of\ndark energy from its origin until now by a factor of approximately $10^{-120}$.\nElementary particles contain information about which laws of nature they obey,\nbut not what exactly these are. Most likely, the laws are not followed by\nobedience to a categorical imperative. Rather, it is assumed, that from the\nvery beginning the information about them is coded in submicroscopic patches of\nthe space-time. The initial density $\\varrho_i$ is supposed to belong to the\nunimpaired cosmological constant obtained from elementary particle theory. Due\nto its huge value it causes an extremely fast spatial expansion by which\ncontinuously new space-time elements are created. To them, the information\nabout the physical laws must be transmitted from the already present\nspace-time. This process needs time which with ever-increasing expansion\nvelocity is getting scarcer and scarcer. It is concluded that this impedes the\nexpansion through a friction-like process which can be described by a term\nproportional to the expansion-velocity. This term is subtracted from the\nexpansion-acceleration. It is shown that the solutions thus obtained are also\nsolutions of the cosmological standard equations employing a scalar field\n$\\Phi$.

Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of\nstellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we\nare facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using\ncurrent techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive\nprecise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution\nspectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all\nobservations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative\nto it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each\nline as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed\nwith HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones\nderived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs\ndemonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces\nnight-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose\na solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the\nmost astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some\nspectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.\nBy measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we\ndemonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6\nthe red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B. By\nmeasuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV\nprecision as other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows\nto demonstrate that each line is differently affected by stellar activity.\nPreliminary results show that studying in details the behaviour of each\nspectral line is probably the key to overcome stellar activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 14:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 09:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

We demonstrate the approach on two examples using the\nempirical data regarding the knowledge creation processes in online chats and\nquestions-and-answers. Precisely, we describe the self-organised criticality as\nthe acting mechanisms in the social knowledge-sharing dynamics and demonstrate\nthe emergence of the hyperbolic geometry of the co-evolving networks that\nunderlie these stochastic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 14:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

The focus of this\npaper is the learning of a single linear primitive, many of which can be\nsequenced to perform more complex tasks. The presented method learns from\ndemonstrations only, without any prior information, how to take advantage of\nmechanical gradients in in-contact tasks, such as assembly, both for\ntranslations and rotations. The method assumes there exists a desired linear\ndirection in 6-D which, if followed by the manipulator, leads the robot's\nend-effector to the goal area shown in the demonstration, either in free space\nor by leveraging contact through compliance. First, demonstrations are gathered\nwhere the teacher explicitly shows the robot how the mechanical gradients can\nbe used as guidance towards the goal. From the demonstrations, a set of\ndirections is computed which would result in the observed motion at each\ntimestep during a demonstration of a single primitive. By observing which\ndirection is included in all these sets, we find a single desired direction\nwhich can reproduce the demonstrated motion. Finding the number of compliant\naxes and their directions in both rotation and translation is based on the\nassumption that in the presence of a desired direction of motion, all other\nobserved motion is caused by the contact force of the environment, signalling\nthe need for compliance. We evaluate the method on a KUKA LWR4+ robot with test\nsetups imitating typical tasks where a human would use compliance to cope with\npositional uncertainty. Results show that the method can successfully learn and\nreproduce compliant motions by taking advantage of the geometry of the task,\ntherefore reducing the need for localization accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 14:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 09:15:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 10:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

This requirement\nrestricts the class of suitable PSF models to analog ones. In addition,\ndeblurring is computationally intensive, hence further requiring\ncomputationally efficient models. A custom candidate fitting both requirements\nis the Gaussian model. However, this model cannot capture the rich tail\nstructures found in both theoretical and empirical PSFs.

Our\nsystem includes two agents, a physical robot and an animated virtual human. The\nsystem's multimodal perception includes an eye-tracker (measures attention) and\na thermal infrared imaging camera (measures patterns of emotional arousal). A\ndialogue policy is presented that selects individual actions and planned\nmultiparty sequences based on perceptual inputs about the baby's internal\nchanging states of emotional engagement.

However, the existing approaches\nare essentially digital: the kymograph photometry is sampled directly from the\ntime-lapse images. As a result, such kymographs rely on raw image data that\nsuffer from the degradations entailed by the image formation process and the\nspatio-temporal resolution of the imaging setup. In this work, we address these\nlimitations and introduce a well-grounded Bayesian framework for the analog\nreconstruction of kymographs. To handle the movement of the object, we\nintroduce an intrinsic description of kymographs using differential geometry: a\nkymograph is a photometry defined on a parameter space that is embedded in\nphysical space by a time-varying map that follows the object geometry. We model\nthe kymograph photometry as a L\\'evy innovation process, a flexible class of\nnon-parametric signal priors. We account for the image formation process using\nthe virtual microscope framework. We formulate a computationally tractable\nrepresentation of the associated maximum a posteriori problem and solve it\nusing a class of efficient and modular algorithms based on the alternating\nsplit Bregman. We assess the performance of our Bayesian framework on synthetic\ndata and apply it to reconstruct the fluorescence dynamics along microtubules\nin vivo in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae.

The goal of these audits is to examine a\npopulation of claims submitted by a healthcare provider for reimbursement by a\nthird party payer to determine the total amount of money which is erroneously\nclaimed. For large audit populations, conclusions about the total amount of\nreimbursement claimed erroneously are often based on sample data. Often, sample\nsize determination must be made in the absence of pilot study data and existing\nmethods for doing so typically rely on restrictive assumptions. This includes\nthe `all-or-nothing errors' assumption which assumes the error in a claim is\neither the entire claim amount or none of it. Under the all-or-nothing errors\nassumption, Roberts (1978) has derived estimates of the variances needed for\nsample size calculations under simple expansion and ratio estimation. Some\naudit populations, however, will contain claims which are partially in error.\nWe broaden existing methodology to handle this scenario by proposing an error\nmodel which allows for partial errors by modeling the line-item error\nmechanism. We use this model to derive estimates of the variances needed for\nsample size determination under simple expansion and ratio estimation in the\npresence of partial errors. In the absence of certain error-rate parameter\nestimates needed to implement our method, we show that conservative sample\nsizes can be determined using the claim data alone. We further show that, under\nall-or-nothing errors, ratio estimation will tend to outperform simple\nexpansion and that optimal stratification is independent of the population\nerror rate under ratio estimation. The proposed sample design methods are\nillustrated on three simulated audit populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 00:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

For both of these theories, we\nreview their constrained and the unconstrained formulation, focusing our\nattention on the latter. We also review the existing literature, confirming the\nresults for the non-local unconstrained formulation and correcting some\ncalculational errors. We briefly discuss the geometrical motivation behind the\nconstruction of the basic building blocks of the theory and we entertain the\npossibility of there being a single equation of motion for all bosonic higher\nspin fields. Some explicit calculations obtained using computer-assisted\nmethods are provided in the appendix, along with the relevant computer code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 01:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-10"}

Here $R$ and $T$ represent\nthe Ricci scalar and trace of the stress-energy tensor, respectively. The\nmodified gravitational field equations are obtained through the metric\nformalism for the Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric with signature\n$(+,-,-,-)$.

The impact of Airbnb listings on\nlocal neighborhoods has been controversially discussed in many cities around\nthe world. The platform's widespread adoption led to changes in urban life, and\nin particular urban tourism. We argue that urban tourism space can no longer be\nunderstood as a fixed, spatial entity. Instead, we follow a constructionist\napproach and argue that urban tourism space is (re-)produced digitally and\ncollaboratively on online platforms such as Airbnb. We relate our work to a\nCSCW research direction that is concerned with the role of digital technologies\nin the production and appropriation of urban space and use the concept of\nrepresentations as a theoretical lens for our empirical study. In that study,\nwe qualitatively analyzed how the two Berlin neighborhoods Kreuzk\\\"olln and\nCity West are digitally constructed by Airbnb hosts in their listing\ndescriptions. Moreover, we quantitatively investigated to what extend mentioned\nplaces differ between Airbnb hosts and visitBerlin, the city's destination\nmanagement organization (DMO). In our qualitative analysis, we found that hosts\nprimarily focus on facilities and places in close proximity to their apartment.\nIn the traditional urban tourism hotspot City West, hosts referred to many\nplaces also mentioned by the DMO. In the neighborhood of Kreuzk\\\"olln, in\ncontrast, hosts reframed everyday places such as parks or an immigrant food\nmarket as the must sees in the area. We discuss how Airbnb hosts contribute to\nthe discursive production of urban neighborhoods and thus co-produce them as\ntourist destinations. With the emergence of online platforms such as Airbnb,\npower relations in the construction of tourism space might shift from DMOs\ntowards local residents who are now producing tourism space collaboratively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 11:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

Different from low-temperature\nelectrolysis, a considerable amount of the input energy is consumed by\nauxiliaries in an HTE system for maintaining the temperature, so the studies on\nsystematic description and parameter optimization of HTE are essentially\nrequired. A few published studies investigated HTE's systematic optimization\nbased on simulation, yet there is not a commonly used analytical optimization\nmodel which is more suitable for integration with power grid. To fill in this\nblank, a concise analytical operation model is proposed in this paper to\ncoordinate the necessary power consumptions of auxiliaries under various\nloading conditions of an HTE system. First, this paper develops a comprehensive\nenergy flow model for an HTE system based on the fundamentals extracted from\nthe existing work, providing a quantitative description of the impacts of\ncondition parameters, including the temperature and the feedstock flow rates. A\nconcise operation model is then analytically proposed to search for the optimal\noperating states that maximize the hydrogen yield while meeting the desired\nsystem loading power by coordinating the temperature, the feedstock flows and\nthe electrolysis current. The evaluation of system performance and the\nconsideration of constraints caused by energy balances and necessary stack\nrequirements are both included. In addition, analytical optimality conditions\nare obtained to locate the optimal states without performing nonlinear\nprogramming by further investigating the optimization method.

The findings indicate that (i) national traditional ads increase\nperceived quality, perceived value, and recent satisfaction; (ii) local\ntraditional ads increase perceived quality and perceived value; (iii) digital\nads increase perceived value; and (iv) competitor ad effects are generally\nnegative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 20:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

However, the spike\ngeneration function is non-differentiable and therefore not directly compatible\nwith the standard error backpropagation algorithm. In this paper, we introduce\na new general backpropagation mechanism for learning synaptic weights and\naxonal delays which overcomes the problem of non-differentiability of the spike\nfunction and uses a temporal credit assignment policy for backpropagating error\nto preceding layers. We describe and release a GPU accelerated software\nimplementation of our method which allows training both fully connected and\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Using our software, we\ncompare our method against existing SNN based learning approaches and standard\nANN to SNN conversion techniques and show that our method achieves state of the\nart performance for an SNN on the MNIST, NMNIST, DVS Gesture, and TIDIGITS\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 10:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}
