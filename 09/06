However, many vital issues which affect its\nperformance are still open. For example, it is widely convinced that high level\nof security and scalability and full decentralization are still impossible to\nachieve simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Bicomp, a bilayer scalable\nNakamoto consensus protocol, which is an approach based on high security and\npure decentralized Nakamoto consensus, and with a significant improvement on\nscalability. In Bicomp, two kinds of blocks are generated, i.e., microblocks\nfor concurrent transaction packaging in network, and macroblocks for leadership\ncompetition and chain formation. A leader is elected at beginning of each round\nby using a macroblock header from proof-of-work. An elected leader then\nreceives and packages multiple microblocks mined by different nodes into one\nmacroblock during its tenure, which results in a bilayer block structure. Such\ndesign limits a leader's power and encourages as many nodes as possible to\nparticipate in the process of packaging transactions, which promotes the\nsharding nature of the system. Furthermore, several mechanisms are carefully\ndesigned to reduce transaction overlapping and further limit a leader's power,\namong which a novel transaction diversity based metric is proposed as the\nsecond level criteria besides the longest-chain-first principle on selecting a\nlegitimate chain when fork happens. Security issues and potential attacks to\nBicomp are extensively discussed and experiments for evaluation are performed.\nFrom the experimental results based on 50 nodes all over the world, Bicomp\nachieves significant improvement on scalability than that of Bitcoin and\nEthereum, while the security and decentralization merits are still preserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 16:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

Based on\nwell-established hypotheses from fault-based testing, we argue that such tests\nare also sensitive for more complex bugs. Since the specification may not\ndefine the system behavior completely, we use reactive synthesis algorithms\nwith partial information. The computed strategies are adaptive test strategies\nthat react to behavior at runtime. We work out the underlying theory of\nadaptive test strategy synthesis and present experiments for a safety-critical\ncomponent of a real-world satellite system. We demonstrate that our approach\ncan be applied to industrial specifications and that the synthesized test\nstrategies are capable of detecting bugs that are hard to detect with random\ntesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 16:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

The first is thermolubricity, designating the\ncondition in which a dry nanosized slider can at sufficiently high temperature\nand low velocity exhibit very small viscous friction f ~ v despite strong\ncorrugations that would commonly imply hard mechanical stick-slip f ~ log(v).\nThe second, apparently unrelated phenomenon present in externally forced\nnanosystems, is the occurrence of negative work tails (\"free lunches\") in the\nwork probabilty distribution, tails whose presence is necessary to fulfil the\ncelebrated Jarzynski equality of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Here we\nprove analytically and demonstrate numerically in the prototypical classical\noverdamped one-dimensional point slider (Prandtl-Tomlinson) model that the\npresence or absence of thermolubricity is exactly equivalent to satisfaction or\nviolation of the Jarzynski equality. The divide between the two regimes,\nsatisfaction of Jarzynski with ther- molubricity, and violation of both, simply\ncoincides with the total frictional work per cycle falling below or above kT\nrespectively. This concept can, with due caution, be extended to more complex\nsliders, thus inviting crosscheck experiments, such as searching for free\nlunches in cold ion sliding as well as in forced protein unwinding, and\nalternatively checking for a thermolubric regime in dragged colloid monolayers.\nAs an important byproduct, we derive a parameter-free formula expressing the\nlinear velocity coefficient of frictional dissipated power in the thermolubric\nviscous regime, correcting previous empirically parametrized expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 16:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Previous theoretical and\nexperimental work demonstrated that the two requirements can be met with\ndeformed dielectric cavities that generate chaotic ray dynamics. Is it possible\nfor a massless Dirac spinor wave in graphene or its photonic counterpart to\nexhibit a similar behavior? Intuitively, because of the absence of\nbackscattering of associated massless spin-1/2 particles and Klein tunneling,\nconfining the wave in a cavity for a long time seems not feasible. Deforming\nthe cavity to generate classical chaos would make confinement even more\ndifficult. Investigating the decay of a spin-1/2 wave from a scalar potential\nbarrier defined cavity characterized by an effective refractive index $n$ that\ndepends on the applied potential and the particle energy, we uncover the\nstriking existence of an interval of the refractive index in which the average\nlifetime of the massless spin-1/2 wave in the cavity can be as high as that of\nthe electromagnetic wave, for both integrable and chaotic cavities.

That is, the global perspective in\nwhich pools are generated may not help the DCS techniques in selecting a\ncompetent classifier for samples that are likely to be mislabelled. Thus, we\npropose in this work an online pool generation method that produces a locally\naccurate pool for test samples in difficult regions of the feature space. The\ndifficulty of a given area is determined by the classification difficulty of\nthe samples in it. That way, by using classifiers that were generated in a\nlocal scope, it could be easier for the DCS techniques to select the best one\nfor the difficult samples. For the query samples in easy regions, a simple\nnearest neighbors rule is used. In the extended version of this work, a deep\nanalysis on the correlation between instance hardness and the performance of\nDCS techniques is presented. An instance hardness measure that conveys the\ndegree of local class overlap is then used to decide when the local pool is\nused in the proposed scheme. The proposed method yielded significantly greater\nrecognition rates in comparison to a Bagging-generated pool and two other\nglobal pool generation schemes for all DCS techniques evaluated.

The model is built\nby stacking two Chern insulators with opposite Chern numbers which transform\nunder conjugate representations of the rotation group, e.g. $p_\\pm$ orbitals.\nDespite its apparent similarity to the Kane-Mele model, it does not host stable\ngapless surface states. Nevertheless the model exhibits topological responses\nincluding the appearance of quantized fractional charge bound to rotational\ndefects (disclinations) and the pumping of angular momentum in response to\nthreading an elementary magnetic flux, which are described by a mutual\nChern-Simons coupling between the electromagnetic gauge field and an effective\ngauge field corresponding to the rotation symmetry. In addition, we show that\nalthough the filled bands of the model do not admit a symmetric Wannier\nrepresentation, this obstruction is removed upon the addition of appropriate\natomic orbitals, which implies `fragile' topology. As a result, the response of\nthe model can be derived by representing it as a superposition of atomic\norbitals with positive and negative integer coefficients. Following the\nanalysis of the model, which serves as a prototypical example of 2D TCIs\nprotected by rotation, we show that all TCIs protected by point group\nsymmetries which do not have protected surface states are either atomic\ninsulators or fragile phases. Remarkably, this implies that gapless surface\nstates exist in free electron systems if and only if there is a stable Wannier\nobstruction. We then use dimensional reduction to map the problem of\nclassifying 2D TCIs protected by rotation to a zero-dimensional (0D) problem\nwhich is then used to obtain the complete non-interacting classification of\nsuch TCIs as well as the reduction of this classification in the presence of\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 17:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 23:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

Using\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations on 16 clusters, we investigate the\nmechanisms of gas depletion of galaxies found inside clusters. The gas\ndepletion mechanisms can be categorized into three channels based on where and\nwhen they took place. First, 34$\\%$ of our galaxies are gas poor before\nentering clusters (`pre-processing'). They are mainly satellites that have\nundergone the environmental effect inside group halos.

In nearly\ncollisionless solar wind, we find that the normalized alpha particle drift\nspeed is slower than the normalized proton beam speed; no correlation between\nfluctuations in both species' drifts about their means; and a strong\nanti-correlation between collisional age and alpha-proton differential flow,\nbut no such correlation with proton beam-core differential flow. Controlling\nfor the collisional dependence, both species' normalized drifts exhibit similar\nstatistical distributions. In the asymptotic, zero Coulomb collision limit, the\nyoungest measured differential flows most strongly correlate with an\napproximation of the Alfv\\'en speed that includes proton pressure anisotropy.\nIn this limit and with this most precise representation, alpha particles drift\nat 67% and proton beam drift is approximately 105% of the local Alfv\\'en speed.\nWe posit that one of two physical explanations is possible. Either (1) an\nAlfv\\'enic process preferentially accelerates or sustains proton beams and not\nalphas or (2) alpha particles are more susceptible to either an instability or\nCoulomb drag than proton beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 19:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

Although great progress has been made in improving the accuracy of\nobject detection in recent years due to the rise of deep neural networks, the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms are highly computationally intensive. In order to\naddress this challenge, we make two important observations in the context of\nvideos: (i) Objects often occupy only a small fraction of the area in each\nvideo frame, and (ii) There is a high likelihood of strong temporal correlation\nbetween consecutive frames. Based on these observations, we propose Pack and\nDetect (PaD), an approach to reduce the computational requirements of object\ndetection in videos. In PaD, only selected video frames called anchor frames\nare processed at full size. In the frames that lie between anchor frames\n(inter-anchor frames), regions of interest (ROIs) are identified based on the\ndetections in the previous frame. We propose an algorithm to pack the ROIs of\neach inter-anchor frame together into a reduced-size frame. The computational\nrequirements of the detector are reduced due to the lower size of the input. In\norder to maintain the accuracy of object detection, the proposed algorithm\nexpands the ROIs greedily to provide additional background around each object\nto the detector. PaD can use any underlying neural network architecture to\nprocess the full-size and reduced-size frames. Experiments using the ImageNet\nvideo object detection dataset indicate that PaD can potentially reduce the\nnumber of FLOPS required for a frame by $4\\times$.

Observations by CoRoT and Kepler have\nshown that the mode amplitudes increase dramatically as the stars ascend the\nred giant branch, i.e., as the frequency of maximum power, $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$,\ndecreases. Most studies nonetheless assume that the modes are well described by\nthe linearized fluid equations. We investigate to what extent the linear\napproximation is justified as a function of stellar mass $M$ and\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$, focusing on dipole mixed modes with frequency near\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$. A useful measure of a mode's nonlinearity is the product of\nits radial wavenumber and its radial displacement, $k_r \\xi_r$ (i.e., its\nshear). We show that $k_r \\xi_r \\propto \\nu_\\mathrm{max}^{-9/2}$, implying that\nthe nonlinearity of mixed modes increases significantly as a star evolves.

A weakly nonlinear\nmixed mode can excite secondary waves in the stellar core through the\nparametric instability, resulting in enhanced, but partial, damping of the\nmode. By contrast, a strongly nonlinear mode breaks as it propagates through\nthe core and is fully damped there. Evaluating the impact of nonlinear effects\non observables such as mode amplitudes and linewidths requires large mode\nnetwork simulations.

For\nneutral atoms, it is an outstanding challenge to design a high-fidelity\ntwo-qubit entangling gate without resorting to difficult techniques like\nshaping laser pulses or cooling atoms to motional ground states. By using spin\necho to suppress the blockade error, we propose an easily realizable\ncontrolled-phase Rydberg quantum gate of high intrinsic fidelity. In the\ncontext of spin echo, we show that the fundamental blockade error of the\ntraditional Rydberg gate, on the order of $\\epsilon\\sim10^{-3}$, actually\nresults from two `clockwise' rotations of Rabi frequencies $\\bar\\Omega_\\pm=V\\pm\n\\sqrt{V^2+\\Omega^2}$. In our `echo' sequence, such an error can be suppressed\nto the order of $\\epsilon^2$ by adding two `anticlockwise' rotations with\nfrequencies $-\\bar\\Omega_\\pm$. With the blockade error effectively removed, the\nerror caused by Rydberg state decay becomes the final fundamental limit to the\ngate accuracy, which in principle, can be reduced beyond the level of\n$10^{-5}$. Furthermore, due to the small population $\\epsilon$ involved in the\n`echo' process, the spin-echo gate is robust against the variation of Rydberg\nblockade caused by the drift of the qubits, so that it can still be much more\naccurate than that of a traditional Rydberg gate even for qubits cooled only to\nthe sub-mK regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 22:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

Oblate\nparticles are found to avoid the region close to the wall, travelling parallel\nto it with small angular velocities, while preferentially sampling high-speed\nfluid in the wall region.

Their reluctancy to rotate around spanwise\naxis reduce the wall-normal velocity fluctuation of the flow and therefore the\nturbulence Reynolds stress similar to oblates; however, they undergo rotations\nin wall-parallel planes which increases the additional solid stresses due to\ntheir relatively larger angular velocities compared to the oblates.

However, the feature details\nare easily being changed or washed out after passing through complicated\nfiltering structures. To better handle these challenges, the paper proposes a\nnovel framework, multi-scale, deep inception convolutional neural network\n(MDCN), which focuses on wider and broader object regions by activating feature\nmaps produced in the deep part of the network. Instead of incepting inner\nlayers in the shallow part of the network, multi-scale inceptions are\nintroduced in the deep layers. The proposed framework integrates the contextual\ninformation into the learning process through a single-shot network structure.\nIt is computational efficient and avoids the hard training problem of previous\nmacro feature extraction network designed for shallow layers.

In this work, we focus on supervising the influential factors extracted\nby the variational autoencoder(VAE). The VAE is proposed to learn independent\nlow dimension representation while facing the problem that sometimes pre-set\nfactors are ignored. We argue that the mutual information of the input and each\nlearned factor of the representation plays a necessary indicator of discovering\nthe influential factors. We find the VAE objective inclines to induce mutual\ninformation sparsity in factor dimension over the data intrinsic dimension and\nresults in some non-influential factors whose function on data reconstruction\ncould be ignored.

In addition to the challenges found in visual\nquestion answering (VQA), which can be seen as one-round dialog, visual dialog\nencompasses several more. We focus on one such problem called visual\ncoreference resolution that involves determining which words, typically noun\nphrases and pronouns, co-refer to the same entity/object instance in an image.\nThis is crucial, especially for pronouns (e.g., `it'), as the dialog agent must\nfirst link it to a previous coreference (e.g., `boat'), and only then can rely\non the visual grounding of the coreference `boat' to reason about the pronoun\n`it'. Prior work (in visual dialog) models visual coreference resolution either\n(a) implicitly via a memory network over history, or (b) at a coarse level for\nthe entire question; and not explicitly at a phrase level of granularity. In\nthis work, we propose a neural module network architecture for visual dialog by\nintroducing two novel modules - Refer and Exclude - that perform explicit,\ngrounded, coreference resolution at a finer word level. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model on MNIST Dialog, a visually simple yet\ncoreference-wise complex dataset, by achieving near perfect accuracy, and on\nVisDial, a large and challenging visual dialog dataset on real images, where\nour model outperforms other approaches, and is more interpretable, grounded,\nand consistent qualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 04:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

We give an overview\ncomparing the theoretical status to the experimental demands of one of four\nforeseen FCC-ee operating stages, Z-boson resonance energy physics, called the\nFCC-ee Tera-Z stage for short. The FCC-ee Tera-Z will deliver the highest\nintegrated luminosities as well as very small systematic errors for a study of\nthe Standard Model (SM) with unprecedented precision. In fact, the FCC-ee\nTera-Z will allow the study of at least one more perturbative order in quantum\nfield theory compared to the LEP/SLC precision. The real problem is that the\npresent precision of theoretical calculations of the various SM observables\ndoes not match that of the anticipated experimental measurements. The\nbottle-necks to overcoming this situation are identified. In particular, the\nissues of precise QED unfolding and the correct calculation of SM\npseudo-observables are critically reviewed. In an Executive Summary, we specify\nwhich basic theoretical calculations are needed to meet the strong experimental\nexpectations at the FCC-ee Tera-Z. Several methods, techniques and tools needed\nfor higher-order multi-loop calculations are presented. By inspection of the\nZ-boson partial and total decay width analyses, it is argued that at the\nbeginning of operation of the FCC-ee Tera-Z, the theory predictions may be\ntuned to be precise enough not to limit the physics interpretation of the\nmeasurements. This statement is based on anticipated progress in analytical and\nnumerical calculations of multi-loop and multi-scale Feynman integrals and on\nthe completion of two-loop electroweak radiative corrections to the SM\npseudo-observables this year.

However, in practice the planned dose\ndistribution may not conform to the actual one due to noisy data and different\ntypes of errors. One such error comes in a form of potentially inaccurate\nconversion of the Hounsfield units (HU) to stopping powers (SP) of protons. We\npropose a method of improving the CC based on a planning CT and proton range\nmeasurements acquired during treatment. The range data were simulated using a\nvirtual CC and a planning CT. The range data were given two types of noise:\nrange shift due to patient setup errors; and range noise due to measurement\nimprecision, including a misalignment of the range measuring device. The method\nconsists of two parts. The first part involves a Taylor expansion of the water\nequivalent path length (WEPL) map in terms of the range shift caused by the\ndifference between the planning and the virtual CC. The range shift is then\nsolved for explicitly, leading to a polynomial function of the difference\nbetween the two CCs. The second part consists in minimizing a score function\nrelating the range due to the virtual CC and the range due to the optimized CC.\nTested on ten different CCs, our results show that, with range data collected\nover a few fractions (less than 10), the optimized CC leads to an overall\nreduction of the range difference. More precisely, on average, the uncertainty\nof the CC was reduced from 2.67% to 1.62%, while the average reduction of the\nWEPL bias was reduced from 2.14% to 0.74%.

At present, the requisite single-shot spin qubit measurements are\nperformed using on-chip charge sensors, capacitively coupled to the quantum\ndots. However, as the number of qubits is increased, this approach becomes\nimpractical due to the footprint and complexity of the charge sensors, combined\nwith the required proximity to the quantum dots. Alternatively, the spin state\ncan be measured directly by detecting the complex impedance of spin-dependent\nelectron tunnelling between quantum dots. This can be achieved using\nradio-frequency reflectometry on a single gate electrode defining the quantum\ndot itself, significantly reducing gate count and architectural complexity, but\nthus far it has not been possible to achieve single-shot spin readout using\nthis technique. Here, we detect single electron tunnelling in a double quantum\ndot and demonstrate that gate-based sensing can be used to read out the\nelectron spin state in a single shot, with an average readout fidelity of 73%.\nThe result demonstrates a key step towards the readout of many spin qubits in\nparallel, using a compact gate design that will be needed for a large-scale\nsemiconductor quantum processor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 07:49:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 00:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

The role of\nmetabolism, and particularly mitochondria, is increasingly being recognised as\nan important explanatory factor in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Most eukaryotic\ncells possess a population of mitochondria, in the sense that mitochondrial DNA\n(mtDNA) is held in multiple copies per cell, where the sequence of each\nmolecule can vary. Hence intra-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity is\npossible, which can induce inter-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity, and may\ndrive aspects of cellular noise. In this review, we discuss sources of\nmitochondrial heterogeneity (variations between mitochondria in the same cell,\nand mitochondrial variations between supposedly identical cells) from both\ngenetic and non-genetic perspectives, and mitochondrial genotype-phenotype\nlinks. We discuss the apparent homeostasis of mtDNA copy number, the\nobservation of pervasive intra-cellular mtDNA mutation (we term\n`microheteroplasmy') and developments in the understanding of inter-cellular\nmtDNA mutation (`macroheteroplasmy').

We suggest that the observed polarimetric\nmodulations occur as a result of an enhanced injection of relativistic\nelectrons into the magnetosphere of the white dwarf as it sweeps past the\nM-dwarf.

Deep\nlearning has become increasingly popular in recent years, following a surge of\ninnovative GPU technology, high-resolution, big datasets and thriving machine\nlearning algorithms. However, there are few examples exploiting this emerging\ntechnology to develop applications for traffic prediction. This is largely due\nto the difficulty in capturing random, seasonal, non-linear, and\nspatio-temporal correlated nature of traffic data.

A deep CNN model is employed to learn the spatio-temporal traffic\npatterns of the input graphs, which are then fed into a deep LSTM model for\nsequence learning. To capture traffic seasonal variations, time of the day and\nday of the week indicators are fused with trained features. The model is\ntrained end-to-end to predict travel speed in 15 to 90 minutes in the future.\nWe compare the model performance against other baseline models including CNN,\nLGBM, LSTM, and traditional speed-flow curves. Experiment results show that the\nD-CLSTM-t outperforms other models considerably. Model tests show that speed\nupstream also responds sensibly to a sudden accident occurring downstream.

The proposed method models the fluid flow using a potential flow\nmodel, which introduces an additional fluid property. This material property\ncurrently requires tuning of the model by comparison to numerical Navier-Stokes\nbased solutions. Topology optimization based on the reduced-order model is\nshown to provide qualitatively similar designs, as those obtained using a full\nNavier-Stokes based model. The number of DOFs is reduced by 50% in two\ndimensions and the computational complexity is evaluated to be approximately\n12.5% of the full model.

Effects of surface segregation of C were observed. Previously unknown\nmatrix effects were observed in these samples, expressed in the decrease of\nLEIS signals of Ru, B and C at low Ru concentrations. The effect disappears for\nRu-rich surfaces. Measurements with different He+ ion energies prove that the\ncharacteristic velocities of the elements involved change with surface\ncomposition. We suggest that these matrix effects appear due to the changes in\nneutralization efficiency in quasiresonant neutralization from the valence band\n(VB-qRN). This neutralization channel is present in elemental C and B due to a\nwide valence band with energy states as low as -20 eV, which are in a\n(quasi-)resonance with the He 1s level. This mechanism was earlier reported for\ngraphitic carbon. We suggest that it can be applied to a much wider range of\nmaterials, leading to potential matrix effects in LEIS from a variety of\nsurfaces, containing B, C and potentially O and N atoms, e.g. borides,\ncarbides, oxides and nitrides, as well as alloys with B and C. This hypothesis\nis supported by additional LEIS measurements on oxidized Ru which show matrix\neffect in Ru-O LEIS signals as well. We argue that it is possible to avoid the\nmatrix effects from compounded surfaces within certain ranges of composition by\na proper choice of reference samples, while for other compositions knowledge of\ncharacteristic velocities is required for reliable quantification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 10:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-07"}

Among the former ones\nwe identify CO, NH$_3$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, etc. Their abundance evolution\ntightly follows the luminosity curve. For CO the abundance increase does not\nexceed an order of magnitude, while for other tracers the abundances increase\nby 2$-$5 orders of magnitude. Other molecules like H$_2$CO and NH$_2$OH have\nlonger retention timescales, remaining in the gas phase for $\\sim10-10^3$ yr\nafter the end of the outburst.

Through the analysis of the Binder cumulant we determined the\nentire phase diagram of the model and from the scaling analysis of the\nnumerical data we obtained the correlation length exponent. For both the\ncritical Binder cumulant and the correlation length exponent, we observed a\ncrossover from classical- to quantum-fluctuation-dominated values at a finite\ntemperature. We studied the behavior of the order parameter distribution of the\nmodel in the glass phase (at finite and zero temperatures). Along with a\nclassical-fluctuation-dominated nonergodic region (where the replica symmetry\nis broken), we also found a quantum-fluctuation-dominated low-temperature\nergodic region in the spin glass phase. In this quantum-fluctuation-dominated\nregion, the order parameter distribution has a narrow peak around its most\nprobable value, eventually becoming a delta function in the\ninfinite-system-size limit (indicating replica symmetry restoration or\nergodicity in the system). We also found that the annealing time (to reach a\nvery low energy level of the classical SK model) becomes practically\nsystem-size-independent when the annealing paths pass through this ergodic\nregion. In contrast, when such paths pass through the nonergodic region, the\nconvergence time grows rapidly with the system size.

From the ultrasound images acquired from the optimally placed\ntransducer, we determine classification accuracy with equally spaced scanlines\nacross the cross-sectional field-of-view (FOV).

State space reduction techniques such as partial\norder reduction simplify the verification problem, however, the reduced state\nspace may still be exponentially large and intractable.\n  This paper discusses \\emph{Iteratively Relaxed Scheduling}, a framework that\nuses scheduling constraints in order to simplify the verification problem and\nenable automated verification of programs which could not be handled with fully\nnon-deterministic scheduling. Program executions are safe as long as the same\nscheduling constraints are enforced under which the program has been verified,\ne.g., by instrumenting a program with additional synchronization. As strict\nenforcement of scheduling constraints may induce a high execution time\noverhead, we present optimizations over a naive solution that reduce this\noverhead. Our evaluation of a prototype implementation on well-known benchmark\nprograms shows the effect of scheduling constraints on the execution time\noverhead and how this overhead can be reduced by relaxing and choosing\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 12:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 14:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

Here, a family of models with a\nparametrization of the energy budget in terms of the deceleration parameter are\nstudied in the light of Gaussian processes using reconstructed data from\n$40$-value $H(z)$ datasets. Eventually, the form of the possible\nnon-gravitational interaction between dark energy and dark matter is\nconstructed from these smoothed $H(z)$ data.

Across the range of sound\nspeeds examined, we find that the influence of the sound speed can be\nencapsulated in a simple \"lumped-parameter\" model proposed by Sorathia et al.\n(2013a). In this model, alignment fronts propagate outward at a speed ~0.2\nrOmega_precess(r), where Omega_precess is the local test-particle precession\nfrequency. Meanwhile, transonic radial motions transport angular momentum both\ninward and outward at a rate that may be described roughly in terms of an\norientation diffusion model with diffusion coefficient ~2c_s^2/Omega, for local\norbital frequency Omega. The competition between the two leads, in isothermal\ndisks, to a stationary position for the alignment front at a radius\nproportional to c_s^(-4/5). For alignment to happen at all, the disk must\neither be turbulent due to the magnetorotational instability in MHD, or, in HD,\nit must be cool enough for the bending waves driven by disk warp to be\nnonlinear at their launch point. Contrary to long-standing predictions, warp\npropagation in MHD disks is diffusive independent of the parameter c_s/(alpha\nv_orb$, for orbital speed v_orb and ratio of stress to pressure of alpha. In\npurely HD disks, i.e., those with no internal stresses other than bulk\nviscosity, warmer disks align weakly or not at all; cooler disks align\nqualitatively similarly to MHD disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 13:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

First, we use the static Bayesian game to capture the\nstealthy and deceptive characteristics of the attacker. A random variable\ncalled the \\textit{type} characterizes users' essences and objectives, e.g., a\nlegitimate user or an attacker.

Here, a hybrid metal-semiconductor dissipative quantum\ncircuit is shown to implement the analogue of a TLL of adjustable electronic\ninteractions comprising a single, fully tunable scattering impurity.\nMeasurements reveal the renormalization group `beta-function' for the\nconductance that completely determines the TLL universal crossover to an\ninsulating state upon cooling. Moreover, the characteristic scaling energy\nlocating at a given temperature the position within this conductance\nrenormalization flow is established over nine decades versus circuit\nparameters, and the out-of-equilibrium regime is explored. With the quantum\nsimulator quality demonstrated from the precise parameter-free validation of\nexisting and novel TLL predictions, quantum simulation is achieved in a strong\nsense, by elucidating interaction regimes which resist theoretical solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 14:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

Mainly based on the oriented variation model, a whole destriping\nframework is proposed by jointly employing an L1-norm constraint and a TV\nregularization to separately capture the global distribution property of stripe\ncomponent and the piecewise smoothness of the clean image.

A light curve was\nobtained and analysed to determine the asteroid spin state. Results. The\nvisible spectrum of 1999 UJ7 exhibits a negative slope in the blue region and\nthe presence of a wide and deep absorption feature centred around ~0.65\nmicrons. The overall morphology of the spectrum seems to suggest a C-complex\ntaxonomy. The photometric behaviour is fairly complex. The light curve shows a\nprimary period of 1.936 d, but this is derived using only a subset of the\nphotometric data. The asteroid may be in a non-principal axis rotational state,\nbut our observational coverage is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.\nConclusions. Although the observed spectral absorption is wider and deeper,\nthis finding may be compatible with the 0.7 microns spectral feature exhibited\nby some Ch-type asteroids and could possibly be interpreted as diagnostic of\nthe presence of hydrated minerals.

The aim of this study was to quantify the ability of quinine to\nconvert directional Cherenkov emission to isotropic fluorescence and evaluate\nits contribution to the total emitted light. Aqueous solutions of quinine were\nprepared with distilled water at various concentrations (0.01 to 1.2 g/L). The\nsolutions were irradiated with photon beams at 6 and 23 MV. The dependence of\nthe light produced as a function of sample concentration was studied using a\nspectrometer with a fixed integration time. Spectral measurements of the\nluminescent solution and the blank solution (distilled water only) were taken\nto deconvolve the Cherenkov and quinine contribution to the overall emission\nspectrum. Using a CCD camera, intensity profiles were obtained for the blank\nand the 1.00 g/L solutions to compare them with the dose predicted by a\ntreatment planning system. The luminescent intensity of the samples was found\nto follow a logarithmic trend as a function of the quinine concentration.

A\nsecond order polynomial function is suggested to describe the relationship\nbetween the difference of the reactivity at the End of Cycle and two factors,\nthe uranium enrichment and the volume fraction of BeO in the UO2-BeO fuel. The\nuranium enrichment is determined to ensure the same cycle length for each BeO\nfraction with zircaloy, FeCrAl, and SiC claddings. Similar neutronic properties\nare observed between the zircaloy and SiC claddings for a given BeO fraction,\nincluding the infinite multiplication factor, the gas release, the power\ndistribution, and the isotopic concentrations. An important feature of UO2-BeO\nfuel is the production of 4He, which is significant compared with current UO2\nfuel. Lower production rates of xenon and krypton are found in the case of the\nUO2-BeO-FeCrAl fuel-cladding system, while those in the UO2-BeO-zircaloy and\nUO2-BeO-SiC systems are quite similar to the current UO2-zircaloy system. The\npower distribution in an assembly and in a fuel pellet is flatter for a higher\nBeO fraction with the same cladding. Higher peak power is found in fuel\nassemblies with FeCrAl compared to the other two claddings, while the radial\npower distribution is quite similar for the three claddings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 16:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 15:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}
