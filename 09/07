We study the Poisuielle\nflow of such materials in a rough channel. In general, similar to yield stress\nfluids, three distinct dynamical states, namely, flowing, stick-slip and jammed\ncan be observed, with a yield threshold dependent on channel width.\nImportantly, the interplay between the finite channel width, and the intrinsic\nordering scale (the grain size) leads to new type of spatiotemporal\nheterogeneity. In wide channels, although the average flow profile remains plug\nlike, at the underlying granular level, there is vigorous grain remodelling\nactivity resulting from the velocity heterogeneity among the grains. As the\nchannel width approaches typical grain size, the flowing polycrystalline state\nbreaks up into a spatially heterogeneous mixture of flowing liquid like patches\nand chunks of nearly static grains. Despite these static grains, the average\nvelocity still shows a parabolic profile, dominated by the moving liquid like\npatches. However, the solid-liquid front moves at nearly constant speed in the\nopposite direction of the external drive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 12:17:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 13:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

An important problem in knot theory is to study the\nminimal ratio of length to width of a flat knotted ribbon. This minimal ratio\nis called the ribbonlength of the knot. It has been conjectured that the\nribbonlength has an upper bound and a lower bound which are both linear in the\ncrossing number of the knot.\n  In the first part of the paper, we use grid diagrams to construct flat\nknotted ribbons and prove an explicit quadratic upper bound on the ribbonlength\nfor all non-trivial knots. We then improve the quadratic upper bound to a\nlinear upper bound for all non-trivial torus knots and twist knots. Our\napproach of using grid diagrams to study flat knotted ribbons is novel and can\nlikely be used to obtain a linear upper bound for more general families of\nknots.

The\ncalibrator's accuracy requirement is driven by the need to reduce upper limits\non cosmic polarization rotation, which is expected to be zero in a large class\nof cosmological models. Cosmic polarization effects such as cosmic\nbirefringence and primordial magnetic fields can generate spurious B-modes that\nresult in non-zero CMB TB and EB correlations that are degenerate with a\nmisalignment of detector orientation. Common polarized astrophysical sources\nused for absolute polarization angle calibration have not been characterized to\nbetter than 0.5 degrees. Higher accuracy can be achieved through\nself-calibration methods, however these are subject to astrophysical foreground\ncontamination and inherently assume the absence of effects like cosmic\npolarization rotation. The deficiencies in these two calibration methods\nhighlight the need for a well characterized polarized source. The calibrator we\npresent utilizes a 76 GHz Gunn oscillator coupled to a frequency doubler,\npyramidal horn antenna, and co-rotating wire-grid polarizer.

We study the magnetar's radio profile shape, flux density, radio\nspectrum, and single pulse behavior over a ~1 year period between MJDs 57233\nand 57621. In particular, the magnetar exhibits a significantly negative\naverage spectral index of $\\langle\\alpha\\rangle$ = -1.86 $\\pm$ 0.02 when the\n8.4 GHz profile is single-peaked, which flattens considerably when the profile\nis double-peaked. We have carried out an analysis of single pulses at 8.4 GHz\non MJD 57479 and find that giant pulses and pulses with multiple emission\ncomponents are emitted during a significant number of rotations. The resulting\nsingle pulse flux density distribution is incompatible with a log-normal\ndistribution. The typical pulse width of the components is ~1.8 ms, and the\nprevailing delay time between successive components is ~7.7 ms. Many of the\nsingle pulse emission components show significant frequency structure over\nbandwidths of ~100 MHz, which we believe is the first observation of such\nbehavior from a radio magnetar.

Currently, a\ndominating view is that G actually learns by minimizing a divergence given that\nthe general objective function is a divergence when D is optimal. However, this\nview has been challenged due to inconsistencies between theory and practice. In\nthis paper, we discuss of the properties associated with most loss functions\nfor G (e.g., saturating/non-saturating f-GAN, LSGAN, WGAN, etc.). We show that\nthese loss functions are not divergences and do not have the same equilibrium\nas expected of divergences. This suggests that G does not need to minimize the\nsame objective function as D maximize, nor maximize the objective of D after\nswapping real data with fake data (non-saturating GAN) but can instead use a\nwide range of possible loss functions to learn to generate realistic data. We\ndefine GANs through two separate and independent D maximization and G\nminimization steps. We generalize the generator step to four new classes of\nloss functions, most of which are actual divergences (while traditional G loss\nfunctions are not). We test a wide variety of loss functions from these four\nclasses on a synthetic dataset and on CIFAR-10. We observe that most loss\nfunctions converge well and provide comparable data generation quality to\nnon-saturating GAN, LSGAN, and WGAN-GP generator loss functions, whether we use\ndivergences or non-divergences. These results suggest that GANs do not conform\nwell to the divergence minimization theory and form a much broader range of\nmodels than previously assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2018 18:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-10"}

In contrast, all known globular clusters have\nsimilar ratios of neutron-capture elements to those of halo stars, suggesting\nthat globular clusters form as part of relatively massive galaxies rather than\nin their own dark matter halos.

The tide raised in\nthe primary by the companion leads to an exchange of angular momentum between\nthe orbit and the stellar spin, causing the orbit to contract and the primary\nto spin up. The rate of orbital decay is computed including both the\nequilibrium tide, damped by turbulent viscosity in the convective envelope, and\nthe dynamical tide, assumed to be a traveling internal-gravity wave in the\nradiative core. For close binaries, the tidal forcing period is expected to be\nmuch shorter than the eddy turnover timescale in the convective envelope, and\nthe prescription for \"reduced\" viscosity is an important consideration. The\ndynamical tide tends to dominate for the closest orbits, while the equilibrium\ntide dominates for more distant orbits, with the crossover point depending on\nthe stellar mass. The spin up of the primary to synchronous rotation occurs for\nsufficiently massive secondaries, and this greatly slows the orbital decay\nuntil the Darwin instability occurs.

To this end, we study the\nsmoothed complexity of finding pure Nash equilibria in Network Coordination\nGames, a PLS-complete problem in the worst case. This is a potential game where\nthe sequential-better-response algorithm is known to converge to a pure NE,\nalbeit in exponential time. First, we prove polynomial (resp. quasi-polynomial)\nsmoothed complexity when the underlying game graph is a complete (resp.\narbitrary) graph, and every player has constantly many strategies. We note that\nthe complete graph case is reminiscent of perturbing all parameters, a common\nassumption in most known smoothed analysis results.\n  Second, we define a notion of smoothness-preserving reduction among search\nproblems, and obtain reductions from $2$-strategy network coordination games to\nlocal-max-cut, and from $k$-strategy games (with arbitrary $k$) to\nlocal-max-cut up to two flips. The former together with the recent result of\n[BCC18] gives an alternate $O(n^8)$-time smoothed algorithm for the\n$2$-strategy case. This notion of reduction allows for the extension of\nsmoothed efficient algorithms from one problem to another.\n  For the first set of results, we develop techniques to bound the probability\nthat an (adversarial) better-response sequence makes slow improvements on the\npotential.

In this\npaper, by exploiting the low-rank structure of the TR latent space, we propose\na novel tensor completion method which is robust to model selection. In\ncontrast to imposing the low-rank constraint on the data space, we introduce\nnuclear norm regularization on the latent TR factors, resulting in the\noptimization step using singular value decomposition (SVD) being performed at a\nmuch smaller scale.

Using spatio-temporal analysis of vehicular mobility, promising\nsolutions can be proposed to alleviate these major challenges, utilizing shared\nmobility and crowd-sourcing. The rise of transportation networks (e.g. Uber,\nLyft), is a mere beginning to shared mobility. In this paper, we address\nproblems of trip representation and matching. Particularly, we study a\nreal-world dataset of trips (from Cologne, Germany), from spatial and temporal\nperspectives. Comparison of trajectories is desired for applications relying on\nspatio-temporal phenomena. For that purpose, we present a novel combined\nspatio-temporal similarity score, based on the weighted geometric mean (WGM)\nand conduct experiments on its applicability and strengths. First, we use the\nscore to find clusters of trips that were spatially and/or temporally separable\nusing spectral clustering. The score is then used in a real-time matching of\ntrips for Catch-a-Ride (CaR) and CarPooling (CP) scenarios. CaR and CP achieve\n$\\approx40\\%$ and $\\approx25\\%$ decrease in traveled distances respectively, at\nthe cost of moving to pick-up and from drop-off locations (i.e. drivers going\non average $<700m$ out of their way on pick-up and drop-off for CP).\nAdditionally, a comparison with the metrics available in the literature is\npresented on CaR scenario. We find that main advantages of WGM include the\nflexibility to favor time or space components, and linearity of runtime\ncomplexity. Finally, we formulate an optimal free float Car-Sharing scenario\n(e.g. scheduling a system of automated vehicles or taxis) resulting in an\naverage of $\\approx3.88$ trips serviced by a car in one hour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 03:42:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 17:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

Scaling video analytics to massive\ncamera deployments, however, presents a new and mounting challenge, as compute\ncost grows proportionally to the number of camera feeds. This paper is driven\nby a simple question: can we scale video analytics in such a way that cost\ngrows sublinearly, or even remains constant, as we deploy more cameras, while\ninference accuracy remains stable, or even improves. We believe the answer is\nyes. Our key observation is that video feeds from wide-area camera deployments\ndemonstrate significant content correlations (e.g. to other geographically\nproximate feeds), both in space and over time. These spatio-temporal\ncorrelations can be harnessed to dramatically reduce the size of the inference\nsearch space, decreasing both workload and false positive rates in multi-camera\nvideo analytics. By discussing use-cases and technical challenges, we propose a\nroadmap for scaling video analytics to large camera networks, and outline a\nplan for its realization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 05:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 01:04:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2018 23:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 20:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Development involves temporal sequences\nof cell states controlled by hierarchies of regulatory structures. It occurs\nover the lifetime of a single individual, and is associated to the gene\nexpression level change of a given genotype. Evolution, by contrast entails\ngenotypic change through the acquisition/loss of genes and changes in the\nnetwork topology of interactions among genes. It involves the emergence of new,\nenvironmentally selected phenotypes over the lifetimes of many individuals.\nHere we present a model of regulatory network evolution that accounts for both\ntimescales. We extend the framework of Boolean models of gene regulatory\nnetworks (GRN)-currently only applicable to describing development to include\nevolutionary processes. As opposed to one-to-one maps to specific attractors,\nwe identify the phenotypes of the cells as the relevant macrostates of the GRN.\nA phenotype may now correspond to multiple attractors, and its formal\ndefinition no longer requires a fixed size for the genotype. This opens the\npossibility for a quantitative study of the phenotypic change of a genotype,\nwhich is itself changing over evolutionary timescales. We show how the\nrealization of specific phenotypes can be controlled by gene duplication events\n(used here as an archetypal evolutionary event able to change the genotype),\nand how successive events of gene duplication lead to new regulatory structures\nvia selection. At the same time, we show that our generalized framework does\nnot inhibit network controllability and the possibility for network control\ntheory to describe epigenetic signaling during development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 07:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 18:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

For each 3D CNN, the CNN features combined with the 29\nhandcrafted features were used as the input for the support vector machine\n(SVM) coupled with the sequential forward feature selection (SFS) method to\nselect the optimal feature subset and construct the classifiers. The fusion\nalgorithm takes full advantage of the handcrafted features and the highest\nlevel CNN features learned at the output layer. It can overcome the\ndisadvantage of the handcrafted features that may not fully reflect the unique\ncharacteristics of a particular lesion by combining the intrinsic CNN features.\nMeanwhile, it also alleviates the requirement of a large scale annotated\ndataset for the CNNs based on the complementary of handcrafted features. The\npatient cohort includes 431 malignant nodules and 795 benign nodules extracted\nfrom the LIDC/IDRI database. For each investigated CNN architecture, the\nproposed fusion algorithm achieved the highest AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and\nspecificity scores among all competitive classification models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 07:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 13:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Method: Through creating a set\nof multiple linear regression models using a total of 113 participants from\nagile teams in six software development organizations from The Netherlands and\nBrazil, we analyzed the predictive power of non-technical individual skills in\nrelation to agile practices. Results: The results show that there is\nsurprisingly low power in using non-technical individual skills to predict\n(i.e. explain variance in) the mature use of agile practices in software\ndevelopment.

For an\neffective action selection, MCTS performs many simulations to build a reliable\ntree representation of the decision space. As such, a bottleneck to MCTS\nappears when enough simulations cannot be performed between action selections.\nThis is particularly highlighted in continuously running tasks, for which the\ntime available to perform simulations between actions tends to be limited due\nto the environment's state constantly changing. In this paper, we present an\napproach that takes advantage of the anytime characteristic of MCTS to increase\nthe simulation time when allowed.

They are regularly spaced ($\\approx 2$ pc) and mainly\noriented along the gas filaments axes. Each NEST contains between 4 and 23\nstars.

This scenario adds a novel ingredient to the standard flare model,\nwhere evaporation flows from flare-impacted chromospheric foot-points interact\nwith each other near the loop top and produce turbulence via KHI. The\nturbulence can act as a trapping region and as an efficient accelerator to\nprovide energetic electrons, which scatter soft X-ray (SXR) photons to HXR\nphotons via the inverse Compton mechanism. This paper focuses on the trigger of\nthe KHI and the resulting turbulence in this new scenario. We perform a\nparameter survey to investigate the necessary ingredients to obtain KHI through\ninteraction of chromospheric evaporation flows. When turbulence is produced in\nthe loop apex, an index of -5/3 can be found in the spectra of velocity and\nmagnetic field fluctuations. The KHI development and the generation of\nturbulence are controlled by the amount of energy deposited in the\nchromospheric foot-points and the time scale of its energy deposition, but\ntypical values for M class flares show the KHI development routinely. Asymmetry\nof energy deposition determines the location where the turbulence is produced,\nand the synthesized SXR light curve shows a clear periodic signal related to\nthe sloshing motion of the vortex pattern created by the KHI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 11:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The key step of our approaches consists in\ndecomposing the action of the model one is considering into its minimal units.\nFor gauge theories those minimal terms are complex numbers, which we refer to\nas abelian color cycles, while for fermions the action is decomposed into\nGrassmann bilinears, which we called abelian color fluxes.

The expansion indices,\nso-called dual variables, become the new degrees of freedom for the description\nof the system once the conventional fields are integrated out. The integration\nover the conventional fields results into weight factors and constraints. The\nconstraints implement the symmetries of the theory in the dual form and imply\nthat the dual configurations which contribute to the long range physics are\nworldsheets for the gauge degrees of freedom and worldlines for matter fields.\nOn the other hand, the weight factors allow one to organize the dual partition\nfunction into a strong coupling series of which all terms are known in closed\nform.

In the majority of plasma\nsimulations surface processes are either neglected or treated via\nphenomenological parameters such as sticking coefficients, sputter rates or\nsecondary electron emission coefficients.

We find three giant molecular\nclouds toward the northeast, east, and near the center of the SNR. Using the\nALMA data, we spatially resolved clumpy molecular clouds embedded within the\noptical nebulae in both the shock-ionized and photoionized lobes discovered by\nprevious H$\\alpha$ and [S II] observations. The total mass of the molecular\nclouds is $\\sim$$800$ $M_{\\odot}$ for the shock-ionized region and $\\sim$$1700$\n$M_{\\odot}$ for the photoionized region. Spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy\nreveals that the absorbing column densities toward the molecular clouds are\n$\\sim$$1.5$-$6.0\\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, which are $\\sim$$1.5$-$15$ times less\nthan the averaged interstellar proton column densities for each region. This\nmeans that the X-rays are produced not only behind the molecular clouds, but\nalso in front of them. We conclude that the dense molecular clouds have been\ncompletely engulfed by the shock waves, but have still survived erosion owing\nto their high-density and short interacting time. The X-ray spectrum toward the\ngas clumps is well explained by an absorbed power-law or high-temperature\nplasma models in addition to the thermal plasma components, implying that the\nshock-cloud interaction is efficiently working for both the cases through the\nshock ionization and magnetic field amplification.

In particular, the convective fluxes are computed by a multi-fluid\nversion of the AUSM+up scheme for the plasma equations, in combination with a\nmodified Rusanov scheme with tunable dissipation for the Maxwell equations.\nSource terms are integrated with a one-point rule, using the cell-centered\nvalue. Some critical aspects of the porting to GPU's are discussed, as well as\nthe performance of two open source linear system solvers (i.e. PETSc,\nPARALUTION). The code design allows for computing both flux and source terms on\nthe GPU along with their Jacobian, giving a noticeable decrease in the\ncomputational time in comparison with the original CPU-based solver. The code\nhas been tested in a wide range of mesh sizes and in three different systems,\neach one with a different GPU. The increased performance (up to 14x) is\ndemonstrated in two representative 2D benchmarks: propagation of circularly\npolarized waves and the more challenging Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM)\nmagnetic reconnection challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 15:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 20:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

The Bloch-Messiah reduction of Gaussian processes to single-mode\nsqueezers and passive (linear) unitaries appears juxtaposed against the\npracticalities of the Schmidt-decomposition for photon pair sources into\ntwo-mode squeezers and passive unitaries. Here, we present a general framework\nwhich unifies these forms as well as elucidating more general structure in\nmultimode Gaussian transformations. The decomposition is achieved by\nintroducing additional constraints into the Bloch-Messiah reduction used to\ndiagonalise Gaussian processes, these constraints motivated by physical\nconstraints following from the inequivalence of different physical degrees of\nfreedom in a system, ie. the temporal-spectral degrees of freedom vs different\nspatial modes in a transformation.

First, the large-scale\nclosed-loop process is decomposed into several subsystems by developing a\nsparse slow feature analysis (SSFA) algorithm which capture changes of both\nstatic and dynamic information. Second, distributed models are developed to\nseparately capture static and dynamic characteristics from the local and global\naspects.

We extend here the existing\nframework of correlated games and find that there are other interesting and\npreviously unknown Nash equilibria that make use of correlations to obtain the\nbest payoff.

Most current graph\nrepresentation learning approaches are transductive, which means that they\nrequire all the nodes in the graph are known when learning graph\nrepresentations and these approaches cannot naturally generalize to unseen\nnodes. In this paper, we present a Fast Inductive Graph Representation Learning\nframework (FI-GRL) to learn nodes' low-dimensional representations. Our\napproach can obtain accurate representations for seen nodes with provable\ntheoretical guarantees and can easily generalize to unseen nodes. Specifically,\nin order to explicitly decouple nodes' relations expressed by the graph, we\ntransform nodes into a randomized subspace spanned by a random projection\nmatrix. This stage is guaranteed to preserve the projection-cost of the\nnormalized random walk matrix which is highly related to the normalized cut of\nthe graph. Then feature extraction is achieved by conducting singular value\ndecomposition on the obtained matrix sketch. By leveraging the property of\nprojection-cost preservation on the matrix sketch, the obtained representation\nresult is nearly optimal. To deal with unseen nodes, we utilize folding-in\ntechnique to learn their meaningful representations. Empirically, when the\namount of seen nodes are larger than that of unseen nodes, FI-GRL always\nachieves excellent results. Our algorithm is fast, simple to implement and\ntheoretically guaranteed.

There have also been found corrections\nto the trajectory equation resulting from the finite thickness of the film.\nNumerical calculations performed for a couple of exemplary curved layers (cone,\nsphere, torus and catenoid) confirm that for thin layers the light ray which is\nrepeatedly reflected, propagates along the curve close to the geodesic but as\nthe layer thickness increases, these trajectories move away from each other.\nBecause the trajectory equations are complicated non-linear differential\nequations, their solutions show some chaotic features. Small changes in the\ninitial conditions result in remarkably different trajectories. These chaotic\nproperties become less significant the thinner the layer under consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 15:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

ACET deploys an electrokinetic\ntransport mechanism without requiring any external prime mover and can be shown\nto be highly effective in reducing hot spot temperatures below their allowable\nlimits. The proposed technique leverages the heat source(s) itself to drive the\nfluid in the ACET cooling mechanism, thereby making this a highly energy\nefficient active technique. Our parametric analyses present the optimal range\nof fluid properties, viz. electrical conductivity where the cooling efficiency\nis maximum. Further, the impact of geometrical parameters as well as input\nvoltages has been characterized. Our results show a reduction of hot spot\ntemperature by more than 30% for flow through a channel of 600 microns under\nappropriate conditions at an applied AC voltage of 10-12 V. Comparison with\nother micro-cooler technologies show the proposed technique to be more energy\nefficient in its range of operation. These results establish the potential of\nthe ACET cooling and can open up a new avenue to be explored for thermal\nmanagement of miniaturized devices and systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 06:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}
