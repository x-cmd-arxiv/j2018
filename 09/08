In CW Tau, the total and\npolarized emission are both smooth and symmetric, with polarization angles\nalmost parallel to the minor axis of the projected disk. In contrast, DG Tau\ndisplays a structured polarized emission, with an elongated brighter region in\nthe disk's near side and a belt-like feature beyond about 0.\"3 from the source.\nAt the same time the total intensity is spatially smooth, with no features. The\npolarization pattern, almost parallel to the minor axis in the inner region,\nbecomes azimuthal in the outer belt, possibly because of a drop in optical\ndepth. The polarization fraction has average values of 1.2% in CW Tau and 0.4%\nin DG Tau. Our results are consistent with polarization from self-scattering of\nthe dust thermal emission. Under this hypothesis, the maximum size of the\ngrains contributing to polarization is in the range 100 - 150 $\\mu$m for CW Tau\nand 50 - 70 $\\mu$m for DG Tau. The polarization maps combined with dust opacity\nestimates indicate that these grains are distributed in a geometrically thin\nlayer in CW Tau, representing a settling in the disk midplane. Meanwhile, such\nsettling is not yet apparent for DG Tau. These results advocate polarization\nstudies as a fundamental complement to total emission observations, in\ninvestigations of the structure and the evolution of protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 16:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

A\nless studied aspect of the DMI is that this interaction is believed to be\noperative in the vicinity of lattice imperfections in crystalline magnetic\nmaterials, due to the local structural inversion symmetry breaking. If this\nscenario leads to an effect of sizable magnitude, it implies that the DMI\nintroduces chirality into a very large class of magnetic\nmaterials---defect-rich systems such as polycrystalline magnets. Here, we show\nexperimentally that the microstructural-defect-induced DMI gives rise to a\npolarization-dependent asymmetric term in the small-angle neutron scattering\n(SANS) cross section of polycrystalline ferromagnets with a centrosymmetric\ncrystal structure. The results are supported by theoretical predictions using\nthe continuum theory of micromagnetics. This effect, conjectured already by\nArrott in 1963, is demonstrated for nanocrystalline terbium and holmium (with a\nlarge grain-boundary density), and for mechanically-deformed microcrystalline\ncobalt (with a large dislocation density). Analysis of the scattering asymmetry\nallows one to determine the defect-induced DMI constant, $D = 0.45 \\pm 0.07 \\,\n\\mathrm{mJ/m^2}$ for Tb at $100 \\, \\mathrm{K}$. Our study proves the generic\nrelevance of the DMI for the magnetic microstructure of defect-rich\nferromagnets with vanishing intrinsic DMI. Polarized SANS is decisive for\ndisclosing the signature of the defect-induced DMI, which is related to the\nunique dependence of the polarized SANS cross section on the chiral\ninteractions. The findings open up the way to study defect-induced skyrmionic\nmagnetization textures in disordered materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 16:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

The single player is given a graph and\na configuration of pebbles and may make pebbling moves by removing 2 pebbles\nfrom one vertex and placing one at an adjacent vertex to eventually have one\npebble reach a predetermined vertex. The pebbling number, $\\pi(G)$, is the\nminimum number of pebbles such that regardless of their exact configuration,\nthe player can use pebbling moves to have a pebble reach any predetermined\nvertex.\n  Previous work has related $\\pi(G)$ to the diameter of $G$. Clarke, Hochberg,\nand Hurlbert demonstrated that every connected undirected graph on $n$ vertices\nwith diameter 2 has $\\pi(G) = n$ unless it belongs to an exceptional family of\ngraphs, consisting of those that can be constructed in a specific manner; in\nwhich case $\\pi(G) = n +1$.

In order\nto deal with these handovers, developing fast and effective resource allocation\nalgorithms is a challenge. This paper introduces the problem of mobility-aware\noptimization of resources in VLC networks using the T-step look-ahead policy\nand employing the notion of handover efficiency. It is shown that the handover\nefficiency can correlate the overall performance of the network with future\nactions based on the mobility of users. Due to the stationary nature of indoor\noptical wireless channels, future channel state information (CSI) can be\npredicted by anticipating the future locations of users. A resource allocation\nalgorithm is thus proposed, which uses CSI to dynamically allocate network\nresources to users. To solve this mathematically intractable problem, a novel\nrelaxation method is proposed, which proves to be a useful tool to develop\nefficient algorithms for network optimization problems with a proportional\nfairness utility function. The resulting algorithm is extremely faster than the\nprevious method and awareness of mobility enhances the overall performance of\nthe network in terms of rate and fairness utility function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 17:48:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 19:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 07:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

When fusion of\nanyons is involved, certain `pseudo-species' anyons appear in the exotic\nstatistical weights of non-Abelian anyon systems; however, the meaning and\nsignificance of pseudo-species remains an open problem. In this paper, we\npropose an extended anyon exclusion statistics on surfaces with gapped\nboundaries, introducing mutual exclusion statistics between anyons as well as\nthe boundary components.

The\n`excitation' modes of pseudo-species corresponds to good quantum numbers of\nsubsystems of a non-Abelian anyon system.

First, image retrieval demands\ndiscriminative visual features, which is significantly different from the\none-hot class prediction in image recognition. Second, due to the disjoint and\npotentially unrelated classes between the training and test set in image\nretrieval, predicting the query category from predefined training classes is\nnot accurate and leads to a sub-optimal adversarial gradient. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a new white-box attack approach, Opposite-Direction\nFeature Attack (ODFA), to generate adversarial queries. Opposite-Direction\nFeature Attack (ODFA) effectively exploits feature-level adversarial gradients\nand takes advantage of feature distance in the representation space. To our\nknowledge, we are among the early attempts to design an attack method\nspecifically for image retrieval. When we deploy an attacked image as the\nquery, the true matches are prone to receive low ranks. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that (1) only crafting adversarial queries is sufficient\nto fool the state-of-the-art retrieval systems; (2) the proposed attack method,\nODFA, leads to a higher attack success rate than classification attack methods,\nvalidating the necessity of leveraging characteristics of image retrieval; (3)\nthe adversarial queries generated by our method have good transferability to\nother retrieval models without accessing their parameters, i.e.,the black-box\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 21:29:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 04:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

In turn, the incorporation of heavy charges into the\nconduction sea leads to an increase in the volume of the Fermi surface. This\nprocess, called Kondo scattering, is accompanied by a dramatic, temperature\ndependent transformation of the electronic interactions and masses. Since the\nKondo phenomena is controlled by quantum fluctuations, here we ask, at which\npoint does the Fermi surface change character? A priori, the answer is not\nclear, since near its onset, the Kondo effect cannot be described as a simple\nhybridization of electronic eigenstates. Conventional descriptions of this\nKondo scattering process consider that hybridization, Fermi volume change, and\n$f$-electron mobility occur simultaneously. However, using angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy to measure the evolution of excitations, we find\nthat the changes of the Fermi surface emerge at temperatures an order of\nmagnitude higher than the opening of the hybridization gap, and two orders of\nmagnitude higher than the onset of the coherent character of the $f$-electrons.\nWe suggest that the large changes in Fermi volume, driven by electronic\nfluctuations, occur at temperatures where the various $\\Gamma_x \\to \\Gamma_y$\ncrystal field-split $f$ levels become accessible to conduction states of the\ncorresponding symmetries.

A common goal is to share a resource,\nsuch as CPU or I/O bandwidth, among distinct users with different demand\npatterns as well as different quality of service requirements. To ensure these\nservice requirements, cloud offerings often come with a service level agreement\n(SLA) between the provider and the users. An SLA specifies the amount of a\nresource a user is entitled to utilize. In many cloud settings, providers would\nlike to operate resources at high utilization while simultaneously respecting\nindividual SLAs. There is typically a tradeoff between these two objectives;\nfor example, utilization can be increased by shifting away resources from idle\nusers to \"scavenger\" workload, but with the risk of the former then becoming\nactive again. We study this fundamental tradeoff by formulating a resource\nallocation model that captures basic properties of cloud computing systems,\nincluding SLAs, highly limited feedback about the state of the system, and\nvariable and unpredictable input sequences. Our main result is a simple and\npractical algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance on the above two\nobjectives. First, we guarantee nearly optimal utilization of the resource even\nif compared to the omniscient offline dynamic optimum. Second, we\nsimultaneously satisfy all individual SLAs up to a small error. The main\nalgorithmic tool is a multiplicative weight update algorithm, and a primal-dual\nargument to obtain its guarantees. We also provide numerical validation on real\ndata to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2018 21:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:33:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 04:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

This paper presents a novel\nsingle-shot face detector, named Selective Refinement Network (SRN), which\nintroduces novel two-step classification and regression operations selectively\ninto an anchor-based face detector to reduce false positives and improve\nlocation accuracy simultaneously. In particular, the SRN consists of two\nmodules: the Selective Two-step Classification (STC) module and the Selective\nTwo-step Regression (STR) module. The STC aims to filter out most simple\nnegative anchors from low level detection layers to reduce the search space for\nthe subsequent classifier, while the STR is designed to coarsely adjust the\nlocations and sizes of anchors from high level detection layers to provide\nbetter initialization for the subsequent regressor. Moreover, we design a\nReceptive Field Enhancement (RFE) block to provide more diverse receptive\nfield, which helps to better capture faces in some extreme poses. As a\nconsequence, the proposed SRN detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nall the widely used face detection benchmarks, including AFW, PASCAL face,\nFDDB, and WIDER FACE datasets.

In\nthis work, we explore whether machine learning - more specifically, deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) - can be trained to predict electron densities faster than DFT.\nFirst, we choose a practically efficient combination of a DFT functional and a\nbasis set (PBE0/pcS-3) and use it to generate a database of DFT solutions for\nmore than 133,000 organic molecules from a previously published database QM9.\nNext, we train a DNN to predict electron densities and energies of such\nmolecules. The only input to the DNN is an approximate electron density\ncomputed with a cheap quantum chemical method in a small basis set (HF/cc-VDZ).\nWe demonstrate that the DNN successfully learns differences in the electron\ndensities arising both from electron correlation and small basis set artifacts\nin the HF computations. All qualitative features in density differences,\nincluding local minima on lone pairs, local maxima on nuclei, toroidal shapes\naround C-H and C-C bonds, complex shapes around aromatic and cyclopropane rings\nand CN group, etc. are captured by the DNN. Accuracy of energy predictions by\nthe DNN is ~ 1 kcal/mol, on par with other models reported in the literature,\nwhile those models do not predict the electron density. Computations with the\nDNN, including HF computations, take much less time that DFT computations (by a\nfactor of ~20-30 for most QM9 molecules in the current version, and it is clear\nhow it could be further improved).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2018 00:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

In this system, the secondary transmitter not only harvests\nenergy from ambient signals (from incumbent users), but also backscatters these\nsignals to its receiver for data transmission. Under the dynamics of the\nambient signals, we first adopt the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to\nobtain the optimal policy for the secondary transmitter, aiming to maximize the\nsystem throughput.

In this work, we\npresent a macroscopic model for predicting the number of vehicles that bypass\nat a traffic diverge. We take into account the selfishness of vehicles in\nselecting their lanes; every vehicle selects lanes such that its own cost is\nminimized. We discuss how we model the costs experienced by the vehicles. Then,\ntaking into account the selfish behavior of the vehicles, we model the lane\nchoice of vehicles at a traffic diverge as a Wardrop equilibrium. We state and\nprove the properties of Wardrop equilibrium in our model. We show that there\nalways exists an equilibrium for our model. Moreover, unlike most nonlinear\nasymmetrical routing games, we prove that the equilibrium is unique under mild\nassumptions. We discuss how our model can be easily calibrated by running a\nsimple optimization problem. Using our calibrated model, we validate it through\nsimulation studies and demonstrate that our model successfully predicts the\naggregate lane change maneuvers that are performed by vehicles for bypassing at\na traffic diverge. We further discuss how our model can be employed to obtain\nthe optimal lane choice behavior of the vehicles, where the social or total\ncost of vehicles is minimized. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be\nutilized in scenarios where a central authority can dictate the lane choice and\ntrajectory of certain vehicles so as to increase the overall vehicle mobility\nat a traffic diverge. Examples of such scenarios include the case when both\nhuman driven and autonomous vehicles coexist in the network.

We use YZiCS, a hydrodynamic high-resolution zoom-in simulation\nof 15 clusters, and focus on the tidal stripping suffered by the dark matter\nhalos of cluster members due to preprocessing. We find ~48% of today's cluster\nmembers were once satellites of other hosts. This is slightly higher than\nprevious estimates, in part, because we consider not just group-mass hosts, but\nhosts of all masses also. Thus, we find the preprocessed fraction is poorly\ncorrelated with cluster mass and is instead related to each cluster's recent\nmass growth rate. Hosts less massive than groups are significant contributors,\nproviding more than one-third of the total preprocessed fraction. We find that\nhalo mass loss is a clear function of the time spent in hosts. However, two\nfactors can increase the mass loss rate considerably; the mass ratio of a\nsatellite to its host, and the cosmological epoch when the satellite was\nhosted. The latter means we may have previously underestimated the role of high\nredshift groups. From a sample of heavily tidally stripped members in clusters\ntoday, nearly three quarters were previously in a host. Thus, visibly disturbed\ncluster members are more likely to have experienced preprocessing. Being hosted\nbefore cluster infall enables cluster members to experience tidal stripping for\nextended durations compared to direct cluster infall and at earlier epochs when\nhosts were more destructive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2018 05:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

Most recent works on adversarial examples for image classification\nfocus on directly modifying pixels with minor perturbations. A common\nrequirement in all these works is that the malicious perturbations should be\nsmall enough (measured by an L_p norm for some p) so that they are\nimperceptible to humans. However, small perturbations can be unnecessarily\nrestrictive and limit the diversity of adversarial examples generated. Further,\nan L_p norm based distance metric ignores important structure patterns hidden\nin images that are important to human perception. Consequently, even the minor\nperturbation introduced in recent works often makes the adversarial examples\nless natural to humans. More importantly, they often do not transfer well and\nare therefore less effective when attacking black-box models especially for\nthose protected by a defense mechanism. In this paper, we propose a\nstructure-preserving transformation (SPT) for generating natural and diverse\nadversarial examples with extremely high transferability. The key idea of our\napproach is to allow perceptible deviation in adversarial examples while\nkeeping structure patterns that are central to a human classifier. Empirical\nresults on the MNIST and the fashion-MNIST datasets show that adversarial\nexamples generated by our approach can easily bypass strong adversarial\ntraining. Further, they transfer well to other target models with no loss or\nlittle loss of successful attack rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2018 10:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 15:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 09:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The retina is the only part of the central nervous\nsystem (CNS) that allows us direct optical access. Not only ophthalmic\ndiseases, but also many degenerative disorders of the CNS go along with\npathological changes in the retina. Consequently, functional analysis of\nretinal neurons could lead to an earlier and better diagnosis and understanding\nof those diseases. Recently, we showed that an activation of photoreceptor\ncells could be visualized in humans using a phase sensitive evaluation of\noptical coherence tomography data. The optical path length of the outer\nsegments changes by a few hundred nanometers in response to optical\nstimulation. Here, we show simultaneous imaging of the activation of\nphotoreceptor and ganglion cells. The signals from the ganglion cells are\nten-fold smaller than those from the photoreceptor cells and were only visible\nusing new algorithms for suppressing motion artifacts. This allowed us to\ngenerate a wiring diagram showing functional connections between photoreceptors\nand ganglion cells. We present a theoretical model that explains the observed\nintrinsic optical signals by osmotic volume changes, induced by ion influx or\nefflux. Since all neuronal activity is associated with ion fluxes, imaging\nosmotic induced size changes with nanometer precision should visualize\nactivation in any neuron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2018 14:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

They reflect not\nonly the socioeconomic activities that happened in our physical world, but also\nsome of the cultures, human interests, and public concerns that exist only in\nthe perceptions of people. Cities are frequently mentioned in news articles,\nand two or more cities may co-occur in the same article. Such co-occurrence\noften suggests certain relatedness between the mentioned cities, and the\nrelatedness may be under different topics depending on the contents of the news\narticles. We consider the relatedness under different topics as semantic\nrelatedness. By reading news articles, one can grasp the general semantic\nrelatedness between cities, yet, given hundreds of thousands of news articles,\nit is very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to manually read them. This\npaper proposes a computational framework which can \"read\" a large number of\nnews articles and extract the semantic relatedness between cities. This\nframework is based on a natural language processing model and employs a machine\nlearning process to identify the main topics of news articles. We describe the\noverall structure of this framework and its individual modules, and then apply\nit to an experimental dataset with more than 500,000 news articles covering the\ntop 100 U.S. cities spanning a 10-year period. We perform exploratory\nvisualization of the extracted semantic relatedness under different topics and\nover multiple years.

The delay-constrained\ninput-queued switch is completely different from the well-understood\ndelay-unconstrained one and thus poses new challenges. We focus on three\nfundamental problems centering around the performance metric of timely\nthroughput: (i) how to characterize the capacity region? (ii) how to design a\nfeasibility/throughput-optimal scheduling policy? and (iii) how to design a\nnetwork-utility-maximization scheduling policy? We use three different\napproaches to solve these three fundamental problems. The first approach is\nbased on Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory, which can solve all three\nproblems. However, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The second\napproach breaks the curse of dimensionality by exploiting the combinatorial\nfeatures of the problem. It gives a new capacity region characterization with\nonly a polynomial number of linear constraints. The third approach is based on\nthe framework of Lyapunov optimization, where we design a polynomial-time\nmaximum-weight T-disjoint-matching scheduling policy which is proved to be\nfeasibility/throughput-optimal.

The approach is\ncapable of learning and focusing on regions of interest via adaptation to map\neither discrete or continuous variables on the terrain using\nvariable-resolution data received from probabilistic sensors. During a mission,\nthe terrain maps built online are used to plan information-rich trajectories in\ncontinuous 3-D space by optimizing initial solutions obtained by a coarse grid\nsearch.

It\nis further shown that the path of P is still a cycloidal function for rolling\nwith frictionless slipping, but where the time dependence of the sinusoidal\nCartesian coordinates of the position of P is modified. In a similar way the\nparametric equations versus time for the orbit with respect to a star of a moon\nin a circular orbit about a planet that is in a circular orbit about a star are\nderived, where the orbits are coplanar.

Because the orientation of detected grasps is\nsignificant, which determines the rotation angle configuration of the gripper,\nwe propose the Orientation Anchor Box Mechanism to regress grasp angle based on\npredefined assumption instead of classification or regression without any\npriors. With oriented anchor boxes, the grasps can be predicted more accurately\nand efficiently.

Since the class skew may\nswitch as time goes, we bring up probability layer to utilize class skew\nwithout any overhead during the runtime. Further, we observe class skew\ndichotomy that some class skew may appear frequently in the future, called hot\nclass skew, and others will never appear again or appear seldom, called cold\nclass skew. Inspired by techniques from source code optimization, two modes,\ni.e., interpretation and compilation, are proposed.
