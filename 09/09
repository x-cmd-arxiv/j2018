However, it is known that accreting young stars are variable\nsources of radiation. This is particularly evident for outbursting sources such\nas EX Lupi and FU Orionis stars. Aim: We investigate how such outbursts affect\nthe vertical structure of the outer regions of the protoplanetary disk, in\nparticular their appearance in scattered light at optical and near-infrared\nwavelengths. Methods: We employ the 3D FARGOCA radiation-hydrodynamics code, in\npolar coordinates, to compute the time-dependent behavior of the axisymmetric\ndisk structure. The outbursting inner disk region is not included explicitly.\nInstead, its luminosity is added to the stellar luminosity and is thus included\nin the irradiation of the outer disk regions. For time snapshots of interest we\ninsert the density structure into the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code and\ncompute the appearance of the disk at optical/near-infrared wavelengths.\nResults: We find that, depending on the amplitude of the outbursts, the\nvertical structure of the disk can become highly dynamic, featuring circular\nsurface waves of considerable amplitude. These \"hills\" and \"valleys\" on the\ndisk's surface show up in the scattered light images as bright and dark\nconcentric rings. Initially these rings are small and act as standing waves,\nbut they subsequently lead to outward propagating waves, like the waves\nproduced by a stone thrown into a pond. These waves continue long after the\nactual outburst has died out. Conclusions: We propose that some of the\nmulti-ringed structures seen in optical/infrared images of several\nprotoplanetary disks may have their origin in outbursts that occurred decades\nor centuries ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2018 17:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The\naccelerated cosmic expansion during this transition, at cosmic time\nt~10^{-36}-10^{-33} seconds, is often viewed as an explanation for the\nuniformity of the CMB temperature, T, which would otherwise have required\ninexplicable initial conditions. With the discovery of the Higgs particle, it\nis now quite likely that the Universe underwent another (electroweak) phase\ntransition, at T=159.5 +/- 1.5 GeV---roughly ~10^{-11} seconds after the big\nbang.

There is currently no established explanation,\nhowever, for the apparent uniformity of the vacuum expectation value of the\nHiggs field which, like the uniformity in T, gives rise to its own horizon\nproblem in standard LCDM cosmology.

The\nfield theory that we consider is the effective theory of axion field arising\nfrom Type IIB string theory compactified to four dimensions. We compute the\nexpression for the power spectrum of vacuum fluctuation in three different\napproaches, namely (1) field operator expansion (FOE) technique with the\nquantum entangled state, (2) reduced density matrix (RDM) formalism with mixed\nquantum state and (3) the method of non-entangled state (NES). For massless\naxion field, in all these three formalism, we reproduce, at the leading order,\nthe exact scale-invariant power spectrum which is well known in the literature.\nWe observe that due to quantum entanglement, the sub-leading terms for these\nthee formalisms are different. Thus, such correction terms break the degeneracy\namong the analysis of the FOE, RDM and NES formalisms in the super-horizon\nlimit. On the other hand, for massive axion field, we get a slight deviation\nfrom scale invariance and exactly quantify the spectral tilt of the power\nspectrum in small scales.

One of the primary\nscience objectives of NEAR was the MAG experiment, which measured the magnetic\nfield in the vicinity of Eros during orbit and after landing. Eros is therefore\nat the present the best characterized asteroid using in situ measurement of\nmagnetism. MAG results suggested that Eros was very unmagnetized-with an upper\nbound on the natural remanent magnetism (NRM) placed at $1.9\\times\n10^{-6}\\mathrm{A\\cdot m^2 \\cdot kg^{-1}}$-especially when compared to meteorite\nsamples of analogous composition. Since meteorites and asteroids are typically\nbelieved to represent the remnants of disrupted parent bodies, the\nramifications of the low level of magnetization of Eros are considerable, since\nit could imply disparate origins for objects of similar composition. In this\npaper, we explore whether there are any systematic effects related to the\nactual process of measurement and derivation of the Erotian NRM, and whether\nsuch effects played a role in the low levels of NRM derived for Eros. By\nsimulating the orbit of NEAR around Eros and using the field strength values\nmeasured by NEAR, we find that we are able to place a higher bound on the NRM\nof Eros by a factor of at least an order of magnitude higher than that\noriginally suggested by Acu\\~{n}a, et al.

A clear distinction is drawn between the decoherence of the atomic\nensemble, and the dephasing originating from the local oscillator. Spin echo\ncancels most of the perturbations affecting the Ramsey experiments, and leaves\nthe residual phase noise of only $19$ mHz mostly attributed to the local\noscillator frequency instability, yielding the increased coherence time of\n$11.9$ s which coincides with the contrast decay time in the Ramsey sequence. A\nnumber of perturbation sources leading to homogeneous and inhomogeneous\ndephasing is discussed. Our atom-chip sensor is useful in probing fundamental\ninteractions, atomtronics, microcantilever, and resonant cavity profiling in\nsitu.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 03:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

The\ndifference between the two processes is clearly discussed in several classical\nsources, starting with Grahame (1952). However, later reference to charge\ntransfer across the metal-solution interface as a defining feature of a\nFaradaic process, has led to ambiguities. Following Grahame, in a Faradaic\nprocess, charged particles transfer across the electrode, from one bulk phase\nto another. Thus, in a Faradaic process, after applying a constant current, the\nelectrode charge, voltage and composition go to constant values. Instead, in a\nnon-Faradaic (capacitive) process, charge is progressively stored. We\ncharacterize the intercalation material nickel hexacyanoferrate by two\nelectrochemical methods and compare with theory. Data for the capacitance of\nthis material is well described by the extended Frumkin isotherm. This data,\nand the correspondence with theory, demonstrates that this is a capacitive\nmaterial and ion and charge storage in this material a non-Faradaic electrode\nprocess.

The results\nshow that evoking the right concept of use of bibliometric indicators and\nresearch evaluation has a long way to go. The lack of recognition of\nbibliometric indicators exists in Taiwanese academia. Generally speaking,\nresearchers may hear of the certain indicator, but they are not familiar with\nits definition and calculation process. Only JIF and h-index are considered as\nwell-known indicators. The results also suggest that the ten principles from\nLeiden Manifesto can be considered as the universal guideline in research\nevaluation since most of Taiwanese researchers agree the contents.

The researchers do have\nunderstanding about the importance of comparison on the same basis, at the\nmeantime, they may use the inappropriate indicators just because of lacking of\nenough knowledge on the variety of indicators.

Except exploring novel EMs with high chemical\nenergy, it is also desirable if the traditional EMs could be assembled at a\nhigher density. However, it is very difficult to surpass their theoretical\nmaximum molecular packing density under ambient conditions, even though a\nhigher density could be achieved under ultra-high pressure (Gigapascals). Such\nsolid-state phase changes are reversible, and hence this high density packing\nis not able to maintain under ambient conditions. Alternatively, in this\nresearch, we demonstrated a molecular level compression effect by stacking of\n2-D TAGP, resulting in a higher density packing of the HMX molecules with\nchanged conformation. The HMX crystal formed under compression in the solvent\nhas a unit cell parameter very close to the reported one observed under\npressure of 0.2 GPa. It shows that the compressed HMX molecules are trapped in\nthe TAGP layers, resulting in a higher density (e.g. 2.13 g cm-3) and also\nhigher heat of formation. The resulted HMX crystals are free of defects, and\nunlike the pristine HMX, no polymorphic transition and melting point were\nobserved upon heating. Experiments and relevant calculations show that the best\nresulted hybrid HMX crystal has a detonation velocity of 10.40 km s-1 and\npressure of 53.9 GPa, respectively. Its ground specific impulse reaches about\n292 s, even much better than CL-20, making it a promising propellant component\nfor future space explorations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 13:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

The decay scheme of\n$^{27}$S is complicated and far from being understood, which has motivated but\nalso presented challenges for our experiment. Method: The $^{27}$S ions were\nimplanted into a double-sided silicon strip detector array surrounded by the\nhigh-purity germanium detectors, where the $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\gamma$\nrays were measured simultaneously.

I suggest exploring the possibility that quantum\nphysics could be part of the answer. The simultaneous unity and complexity of\nsubjective experience is difficult to understand from a classical physics\nperspective. In contrast, quantum entanglement is naturally both complex and\nunified. Moreover the concept of matter is much more subtle in quantum physics\ncompared to classical physics, and quantum computing shows that quantum effects\ncan be useful for information processing. Building on recent progress in\nquantum technology and neuroscience, I propose a concrete hypothesis as a basis\nfor further investigation, namely that subjective experience is related to the\ndynamics of a complex entangled state of spins, which is continuously generated\nand updated through the exchange of photons. Spins in condensed matter systems\nat room or body temperature can have coherence times in the relevant range for\nsubjective experience (milliseconds to seconds). Photons are well suited for\ndistributing entanglement over macroscopic distances. Neurons emit photons,\nreactive oxygen species in the mitochondria being likely sources. Opsins,\nlight-sensitive proteins that are plausible single-photon detectors, exist in\nthe brain and are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that they serve a\nfunction. We have recently shown by detailed numerical modeling that axons can\nplausibly act as photonic waveguides. The oxygen molecule, which has non-zero\nelectronic spin and emits photons, might serve as an interface between photons\nand spins. The achievable photon rates seem to be more than sufficient to\nsupport the bandwidth of subjective experience.

The first class of nonlinear\nstates emerged out of a nice combination of the purely hydrodynamic vortex/wave\ninteraction theory by Hall \\& Smith (1991) and the resonant absorption theories\non Alfv\\'en waves, developed in the solar physics community (e.g. Sakurai et\nal. 1991; Goossens et al. 1995). Similar to the hydrodynamic theory, the\nmechanism of the MHD states can be explained by the successive interaction of\nthe roll, streak, and wave fields, which are now defined both for the\nhydrodynamic and magnetic fields. The derivation of this `vortex/Alfv\\'en wave\ninteraction' state is rather straightforward as the scalings for both of the\nhydrodynamic and magnetic fields are identical. It turns out that the leading\norder magnetic field of the asymptotic states appears only when a small\nexternal magnetic field is present. However, it does not mean that purely\nshear-driven dynamos are not possible.

To avoid any complexity associated with the chaotic nature of\nturbulence and flow geometry, nonlinear steady solutions of the\nviscous-resistive magneto-hydrodynamic equations in plane Couette flow have\nbeen utilised. Two classes of nonlinear MHD states, which convert kinematic\nenergy to magnetic energy effectively, have been determined. The first class of\nnonlinear states can be obtained when a small spanwise uniform magnetic field\nis applied to the known hydrodynamic solution branch of the plane Couette flow.\nThe nonlinear states are characterised by the hydrodynamic/magnetic roll-streak\nand the resonant layer at which strong vorticity and current sheets are\nobserved. These flow features, and the induced strong streamwise magnetic\nfield, are fully consistent with the vortex/Alfv\\'en wave interaction theory\nproposed in Deguchi (2019). When the spanwise uniform magnetic field is\nswitched off, the solutions become purely hydrodynamic. However, the second\nclass of `self-sustained shear driven dynamos' at the zero-external magnetic\nfield limit can be found by homotopy via the forced states subject to a\nspanwise uniform current field. The discovery of the dynamo states has\nmotivated the corresponding large Reynolds number matched asymptotic analysis\nin Deguchi (2019). Here, the reduced equations derived by the asymptotic theory\nhave been solved numerically. The asymptotic solution provides remarkably good\npredictions for the finite Reynolds number dynamo solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 05:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 22:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

This equation is compared with the\nclassical Dirac equation. There is shown that, since the presence of isotopic\nfield-charges would distort the Lorentz invariance of the equation, there is a\ntransformation, which together with the Lorenz transformation restores the\ninvariance of the equation, in accordance with the conservation of the isotopic\nfield-charge spin (Darvas, 2009).
