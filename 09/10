This can lead to unphysical cusps and even discontinuities in the\npotential energy surface. In this work, we present an even-handed framework for\nlocalized orbital partitioning that ensures consistent subsystems across a set\nof molecular geometries. We illustrate this problem and the even-handed\nsolution with a simple example of an SN2 reaction.

The beam pair selection uses the upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) with a newly proposed risk-aware feature, while the beam\nrefinement uses a modified optimistic optimization algorithm. The proposed\nalgorithms learn to recommend good beam pairs quickly. When using 16x16 arrays\nat both the transmitter and receiver, it can achieve on average 1dB gain over\nthe exhaustive search (over 271x271 beam pairs) on the unrefined codebook\nwithin 100 time-steps with a training budget of only 30 beam pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 17:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:24:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 22:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

In this work,\nwe address the problem of mid-air finger writing using web-cam video as input.\nIn spite of recent advances in object detection and tracking, accurate and\nrobust detection and tracking of the fingertip remains a challenging task,\nprimarily due to small dimension of the fingertip. Moreover, the initialization\nand termination of mid-air finger writing is also challenging due to the\nabsence of any standard delimiting criterion. To solve these problems, we\npropose a new writing hand pose detection algorithm for initialization of\nair-writing using the Faster R-CNN framework for accurate hand detection\nfollowed by hand segmentation and finally counting the number of raised fingers\nbased on geometrical properties of the hand. Further, we propose a robust\nfingertip detection and tracking approach using a new signature function called\ndistance-weighted curvature entropy. Finally, a fingertip velocity-based\ntermination criterion is used as a delimiter to mark the completion of the\nair-writing gesture. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed fingertip\ndetection and tracking algorithm over state-of-the-art approaches giving a mean\nprecision of 73.1 % while achieving real-time performance at 18.5 fps, a\ncondition which is of vital importance to air-writing.

We focus on circumstances where the stratification is sufficiently\n`strong' so that HWI is the dominant primary instability of the flow. Our\nnumerical findings demonstrate the emergence of self-organised criticality\n(SOC) that is manifest as an adjustment of an appropriately defined gradient\nRichardson number, $Ri_g$, associated with the horizontally-averaged mean flow,\nin such a way that it is continuously attracted towards a critical value of\n$Ri_g \\sim 1/4$. This self-organization occurs through a continuously\nreinforced localisation of the `scouring' motions (i.e. `avalanches') that are\ncharacteristic of the turbulence induced by the break down of Holmboe wave\ninstabilities and are developed on the upper and lower flanks of the sharply\nlocalized density interface, embedded within a much more diffuse shear layer.\nThese localised `avalanches' are also found to exhibit the expected scale\ninvariant characteristics. From an energetics perspective, the emergence of SOC\nis expressed in the form of a long-lived turbulent flow that remains in a\n`quasi-equilibrium' state for an extended period of time. Most importantly, the\nirreversible mixing that results from such self-organised behavior appears to\nbe characterized generically by a universal cumulative turbulent flux\ncoefficient of $\\Gamma_c \\sim 0.2$ only for turbulent flows engendered by\nHolmboe wave instability. The existence of this self-organised critical state\ncorroborates the original physical arguments associated with self-regulation of\nstratified turbulent flows as involving a `kind of equilibrium' as described by\nTurner (1973).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 20:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

This paper is focused on graph-Laplacian\ndimension reduction for the spectral clustering of data as a primary\napplication. Spectral embedding provides a low-dimensional parametrization of\nthe data manifold which makes the subsequent task (e.g., clustering) much\neasier. However, despite reducing the dimensionality of data, the overall\ncomputational cost may still be prohibitive for large data sets due to two\nfactors. First, computing the partial eigendecomposition of the graph-Laplacian\ntypically requires a large Krylov subspace. Second, after the spectral\nembedding is complete, one still has to operate with the same number of data\npoints. For example, clustering of the embedded data is typically performed\nwith various relaxations of k-means which computational cost scales poorly with\nrespect to the size of data set. In this work, we switch the focus from the\nentire data set to a subset of graph vertices (target subset). We develop two\nnovel algorithms for such low-dimensional representation of the original graph\nthat preserves important global distances between the nodes of the target\nsubset. In particular, it allows to ensure that target subset clustering is\nconsistent with the spectral clustering of the full data set if one would\nperform such. That is achieved by a properly parametrized reduced-order model\n(ROM) of the graph-Laplacian that approximates accurately the diffusion\ntransfer function of the original graph for inputs and outputs restricted to\nthe target subset. Working with a small target subset reduces greatly the\nrequired dimension of Krylov subspace and allows to exploit the conventional\nalgorithms (like approximations of k-means) in the regimes when they are most\nrobust and efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 22:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 17:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 20:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

The objective is to maximize some network\nutility function based on given traffic statistics collected over a slow\ntimescale, conceived to be seconds to minutes. A key challenge is scalability:\ninterference across cells creates dependencies across the entire network,\nmaking the optimization problem computationally challenging as the size of the\nnetwork becomes large. A suboptimal solution is presented, which performs well\nin networks consisting of one hundred access points (APs) serving several\nhundred user devices. This is achieved by optimizing over local overlapping\nneighborhoods, defined by interference conditions, and by exploiting the\nsparsity of a globally optimal solution. Specifically, with a total of $k$ user\ndevices in the entire network, it suffices to divide the spectrum into $k$\nsegments, where each segment is mapped to a particular set, or pattern, of\nactive APs within each local neighborhood. The problem is then to find a\nmapping of segments to patterns, and to optimize the widths of the segments. A\nconvex relaxation is proposed for this, which relies on a re-weighted $\\ell_1$\napproximation of an $\\ell_0$ constraint, and is used to enforce the mapping of\na unique pattern to each spectrum segment. A distributed implementation based\non alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is also proposed.\nNumerical comparisons with benchmark schemes show that the proposed method\nachieves a substantial increase in achievable throughput and/or reduction in\nthe average packet delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 22:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Currently template-fitting errors dominate, but as radio\ntelescopes push towards higher signal-to-noise ratios, jitter becomes the next\ndominant term for most millisecond pulsars. Understanding the statistics of\njitter becomes crucial for properly characterizing arrival-time uncertainties.\nWe characterize the radio-frequency dependence of jitter using data on 48\npulsars in the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves\n(NANOGrav) timing program. We detect significant jitter in 43 of the pulsars\nand test several functional forms for its frequency dependence; we find\nsignificant frequency dependence for 30 pulsars.

Despite a massive amount of work\nfocusing on making classifiers robust, the task seems quite challenging. In\nthis work, through a theoretical study, we investigate the adversarial risk and\nrobustness of classifiers and draw a connection to the well-known phenomenon of\nconcentration of measure in metric measure spaces. We show that if the metric\nprobability space of the test instance is concentrated, any classifier with\nsome initial constant error is inherently vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations.\n  One class of concentrated metric probability spaces are the so-called Levy\nfamilies that include many natural distributions. In this special case, our\nattacks only need to perturb the test instance by at most $O(\\sqrt n)$ to make\nit misclassified, where $n$ is the data dimension. Using our general result\nabout Levy instance spaces, we first recover as special case some of the\npreviously proved results about the existence of adversarial examples. However,\nmany more Levy families are known (e.g., product distribution under the Hamming\ndistance) for which we immediately obtain new attacks that find adversarial\nexamples of distance $O(\\sqrt n)$.\n  Finally, we show that concentration of measure for product spaces implies the\nexistence of forms of \"poisoning\" attacks in which the adversary tampers with\nthe training data with the goal of degrading the classifier.

Since the bids from contracts are decided by\nthe publisher, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach\nto derive cooperative policies for the publisher to maximize its yield in an\nunstable environment.

The observed three-photon\nsuperbunching is helpful to increase the visibility of ghost imaging and\nunderstand the physics of third-order interference of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 07:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

In contrast, ohmic contact is desirable\nand can be achieved by the presence of a nonrectifying or tunneling barrier.\nHere, we demonstrate that an nonrectifying barrier can be realized by\ncontacting indium (In), a low work function metal, with layered InSe because of\na favorable band alignment at the In-InSe interface.

We characterise the\nepilayer structure with x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional transmission\nelectron microscopy, revealing (111) stacking. The saturation magnetization\nfalls as the proximity magnetisation in Pt is reduced, whilst the perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy $K_\\mathrm{u}$ rises. The micromagnetic DMI strength $D$\nwas determined using the bubble expansion technique and also rises from a\nnegligible value when $x=0$ to $\\sim 1$ mJ/m$^2$ for $x = 1$. The depinning\nfield at which field-driven domain wall motion crosses from the creep to the\ndepinning regime rises from $\\sim 40$ to $\\sim 70$ mT, attributed to greater\nspatial fluctuations of the domain wall energy with increasing Au\nconcentration. Meanwhile, the increase in DMI causes the Walker field to rise\nfrom $\\sim 10$ to $\\sim 280$ mT, meaning that only in the $x = 1$ sample is the\nsteady flow regime accessible. The full dependence of domain wall velocity on\ndriving field bears little resemblance to the prediction of a simple\none-dimensional model, but can be described very well using micromagnetic\nsimulations with a realistic model of disorder. These reveal a rise in Gilbert\ndamping as $x$ increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 09:42:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 20:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

However, they have the following limitations: (i) We\ncannot change the pattern repeated depending on the current repeat count, and\n(ii) we cannot apply them to arbitrary data structures such as trees and graphs\nother than lists. This paper proposes the loop patterns that overcome these\nlimitations. This paper presents numerous working examples and formal semantics\nof the loop patterns. The examples in this paper are coded in the Egison\nprogramming language, which features the customizable non-linear\npattern-matching facility for non-free data types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 11:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

To ensure both\ncomputation efficiency and effective responsiveness for interactive\nsegmentation, superpixels are used in computing geodesic distances instead of\npixels.

Through the alternating\ndirection strategy, the MRF energy minimization problem is divided into two\nsubproblems, which then can be easily solved by steepest gradient descent (SGD)\nand FBS respectively. Experimental results on the VGG interactive image\nsegmentation dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art ones, and in particular, it can achieve satisfactory\nedge-smooth segmentation results even when the foreground and background color\nappearances are quite indistinctive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 14:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

It is well known that the quality of\nthe bounds achieved through this flexible bounding method is highly reliant on\nthe ordering of variables chosen for building the diagram, and finding an\nordering that optimizes standard metrics is an NP-hard problem.

Methods:\nWe propose an approach based on Markov switching autoregressive model (MSAR) to\nsegmenting the HS into four fundamental components each with distinct\nsecond-order structure. The identified boundaries are then utilized for\nautomated classification of pathological HS using the continuous density hidden\nMarkov model (CD-HMM). The MSAR formulated in a state-space form is able to\ncapture simultaneously both the continuous hidden dynamics in HS, and the\nregime switching in the dynamics using a discrete Markov chain. This overcomes\nthe limitation of HMM which uses a single-layer of discrete states. We\nintroduce three schemes for model estimation: (1.) switching Kalman filter\n(SKF); (2.) refined SKF; (3.) fusion of SKF and the duration-dependent Viterbi\nalgorithm (SKF-Viterbi). Results: The proposed methods are evaluated on\nPhysionet/CinC Challenge 2016 database. The SKF-Viterbi significantly\noutperforms SKF by improvement of segmentation accuracy from 71% to 84.2%. The\nuse of CD-HMM as a classifier and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)\nas features can characterize not only the normal and abnormal morphologies of\nHS signals but also morphologies considered as unclassifiable (denoted as\nX-Factor). It gives classification rates with best gross F1 score of 90.19\n(without X-Factor) and 82.7 (with X-Factor) for abnormal beats. Conclusion: The\nproposed MSAR approach for automatic localization and detection of pathological\nHS shows a noticeable performance on large HS dataset. Significance: It has\npotential applications in heart monitoring systems to assist cardiologists for\npre-screening of heart pathologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 15:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

The proposed framework determines both the optimal adaptation and\ndata paths for delivering the requested video files from HTTP-media servers to\nDASH clients.

Unlike prior methods which attempted\nto move the location of select resonances outward in phase space, our approach\naims to move all resonances concurrently. These resonances are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with fixed points of symplectic maps, which in turn are in a\none-to-one correspondence with the critical points of their generating\nfunction. Thus in this approach, the problem of enlarging dynamic aperture\nboils down to an approximation problem: given a generating function,\napproximate it by a function whose critical points are outside a specified\nelliptical region.\n  In attempting to solve the generating function approximation problem, we\nemployed stable polynomials. Many stable polynomials have a determinantal\nrepresentation that indicates stability. However, it is an open question as to\nwhether such a determinantal representation can be found for a given stable\npolynomial. In seeking to answer this, we made progress towards constructing a\nsymmetric determinantal representations of multivariable polynomials with the\nsmallest sized linear pencil.
