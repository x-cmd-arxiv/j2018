Previous deep-learning studies usually employ supervised neural\nnetworks to directly learn the spatial transformation from one image to\nanother, requiring task-specific ground-truth registration for model training.\nDue to the difficulty in collecting precise ground-truth registration,\nimplementation of these supervised methods is practically challenging. Although\nseveral unsupervised networks have been recently developed, these methods\nusually ignore the inherent inverse-consistent property (essential for\ndiffeomorphic mapping) of transformations between a pair of images. Also,\nexisting approaches usually encourage the to-be-estimated transformation to be\nlocally smooth via a smoothness constraint only, which could not completely\navoid folding in the resulting transformation. To this end, we propose an\nInverse-Consistent deep Network (ICNet) for unsupervised deformable image\nregistration. Specifically, we develop an inverse-consistent constraint to\nencourage that a pair of images are symmetrically deformed toward one another,\nuntil both warped images are matched. Besides using the conventional smoothness\nconstraint, we also propose an anti-folding constraint to further avoid folding\nin the transformation. The proposed method does not require any supervision\ninformation, while encouraging the diffeomoprhic property of the transformation\nvia the proposed inverse-consistent and anti-folding constraints. We evaluate\nour method on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for\ntissue segmentation and anatomical landmark detection, with results\ndemonstrating the superior performance of our ICNet over several\nstate-of-the-art approaches for deformable image registration.

Our\nmethod works by first predicting a coarse shape as well as the object pose and\nsilhouette using CNNs, followed by a novel 3D refinement CNN which refines the\ncoarse shapes using the constructed probabilistic visual hulls. Experiment on\nboth synthetic data and real images show that embedding a single-view visual\nhull for shape refinement can significantly improve the reconstruction quality\nby recovering more shapes details and improving shape consistency with the\ninput image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

More importantly, we prove that\nthe physical constraints in the form of a deterministic linear operator are\nguaranteed in the resulting prediction. We also provide an error estimate in\npreserving the physical constraints when errors are included in the stochastic\nmodel realizations. To reduce the computational cost of obtaining stochastic\nmodel realizations, we propose a multilevel Monte Carlo estimate of the mean\nand covariance functions. Further, we present an active learning algorithm that\nguides the selection of additional observation locations.

At present, almost all\naudio-based information hiding methods are based on carrier modification mode.\nHowever, this mode is equivalent to adding noise to the original signal,\nresulting in a difference in the statistical feature distribution of the\ncarrier before and after steganography, which impairs the concealment of the\nentire system. In this paper, we propose an automatic audio generation-based\nsteganography(AAG-Stega), which can automatically generate high-quality audio\ncovers on the basis of the secret bits stream that needs to be embedded. In the\nautomatic audio generation process, we reasonably encode the conditional\nprobability distribution space of each sampling point and select the\ncorresponding signal output according to the bitstream to realize the secret\ninformation embedding.

The bots\nhad to make their decisions based solely on visual information, i.e., a raw\nscreen buffer. To play well, the bots needed to understand their surroundings,\nnavigate, explore, and handle the opponents at the same time.

Such a state defies available proposals for\nlarge eccentricities. We argue that it is instead uniquely produced by a\ndecaying protoplanetary disk. When the disk was massive, its precessional\neffect on the planets forced the two apses to center around an anti-aligned\nstate. And as the disk is gradually eroded, the pair of planets are\nadiabatically transported to a new state where most of the eccentricity (or\nrather, the angular momentum deficit) is transferred to the inner planet, and\nthe two apses are largely anti-aligned. During this transport, any initial\nmutual inclination may be reduced or enhanced; either may be compatible with\nthe current constraints. So a primordial disk can drive up planet\neccentricities both in resonant planet pairs (as has been shown for GJ 876) and\nin secularly interacting, non-resonant pairs.

First, we cast the\nproblem as a dictionary learning (DL) problem where the key electricity\npatterns representing consumption behaviors are extracted for each device and\nstored in a dictionary matrix. The electricity signal of each device is then\nmodeled by a linear combination of such patterns with sparse coefficients that\ndetermine the contribution of each device in the total electricity. Although\npopular, the classic DL approach is prone to high error in real-world\napplications including energy disaggregation, as it merely finds linear\ndictionaries. Moreover, this method lacks a recurrent structure; thus, it is\nunable to leverage the temporal structure of energy signals. Motivated by such\nshortcomings, we propose a novel optimization program where the dictionary and\nits sparse coefficients are optimized simultaneously with a deep neural model\nextracting powerful nonlinear features from the energy signals. A long\nshort-term memory auto-encoder (LSTM-AE) is proposed with tunable time\ndependent states to capture the temporal behavior of energy signals for each\ndevice. We learn the dictionary in the space of temporal features captured by\nthe LSTM-AE rather than the original space of the energy signals; hence, in\ncontrast to the traditional DL, here, a nonlinear dictionary is learned using\npowerful temporal features extracted from our deep model. Real experiments on\nthe publicly available Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset (REDD) show\nsignificant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies in terms\nof the disaggregation accuracy and F-score metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 18:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Traditionally, the days over which\nthe proximity effect is felt are pre-specified in fixed windows around each\nholiday, allowing no uncertainty in their identification. We are motivated by\nan application to modelling daily gas demand in two large British regions. We\nintroduce a novel model which does not fix the days on which the proximity\neffect is felt. Our approach uses a four-state, non-homogeneous hidden Markov\nmodel, with cyclic dynamics, where the classification of days as public\nholidays is observed, but the assignment of days as \"pre-holiday\",\n\"post-holiday\" or \"normal\" is unknown. The number of days to the preceding and\nsucceeding holidays guide transitions between states. We apply Bayesian\ninference and illustrate the benefit of our modelling approach. A preliminary\nversion of the model is now being used by one of the UK's regional distribution\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 20:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 10:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

Models simulating community dynamics\novercome the technical challenges of conducting species removal experiments in\nthe field.

We use this model to investigate\nwhat traits are best predictors of species effects on community productivity\nand on nutrient cycling. To do so, we removed 161 tropho-species (groups of\nfunctionally identical species) one at a time from 48 forest soil food webs,\nand simulated their dynamics until equilibrium. Simulations revealed that\ncombinations of traits better determine removal effects than single ones. The\nsmallest species are the most competitive ones, but carnivores of various body\nmasses presenting the highest connectivity and resource similarity could be key\nstone species in the regulation of competitive forces. Despite this, most\nremovals had low effects, suggesting functional redundancy provides a high\nresistance of soil food webs to single tropho-species extinction. We also\nhighlight for the first time that food web structure and soil fertility can\ndrastically change species effects in an unpredictable way. Moreover, the\nexclusion of detritus and stoichiometric constraints in past studies lead to\nunderestimations of indirect effects and retroactions.

Subspace projection with array radio telescopes has been\nsuggested as an alternative to data excision to avoid important losses of data\nand overcome its inherent ineffectiveness with continuous interference. Spatial\nfiltering relies on the estimation of the RFI spatial contribution, and the\nprojection of the subspace spanned by the RFI out of the observed data vector\nspace. To perform well, the dimensionality of the RFI subspace is constrained.\nRFI subspace estimation techniques assume the source of RFI to be spatially\nstationary over the sample covariance matrix evaluation.

To face this challenge theory\nhas responded by making cosmological simulations of huge computational volumes\nwith equally increasing the number of dark matter particles and supercomputing\nresources. Thus, it is taken for granted that the ideal situation is when a\nsingle computational box encompasses the whole effective volume of the\nobservational survey, e.g., ~50 Gpch^3 for the DESI and Euclid surveys. Here we\nstudy the effects of missing long-waves in a finite volume using several\nrelevant statistics: the abundance of dark matter halos, the PDF, the\ncorrelation function and power spectrum, and covariance matrices. Finite volume\neffects can substantially modify the results if the computational volumes are\nless than ~(500Mpch)^3. However, the effects become extremely small and\npractically can be ignored when the box-size exceeds ~1Gpch^3. We find that the\naverage power spectra of dark matter fluctuations show remarkable lack of\ndependence on the computational box-size with less than 0.1% differences\nbetween 1Gpch and 4Gpch boxes. No measurable differences are expected for the\nhalo mass functions for these volumes. The covariance matrices are scaled\ntrivially with volume, and small corrections due to super-sample modes can be\nadded.

In the\ncounting rule-based detection in an $N-$sensor network, the local sensors\ntransmit binary decisions to the fusion center, where the number of all $N$\nlocal-sensor detections are counted and compared to a threshold. In the\nordering scheme, sensors transmit their unquantized statistics to the fusion\ncenter in a sequential manner; highly informative sensors enjoy higher priority\nfor transmission. When sufficient evidence is collected at the fusion center\nfor decision making, the transmissions from the sensors are stopped. The\nordering scheme achieves the same error probability as the optimum\nunconstrained energy approach (which requires observations from all the $N$\nsensors) with far fewer sensor transmissions. The scheme proposed in this paper\nimproves the energy efficiency of the counting rule detector by ordering the\nsensor transmissions: each sensor transmits at a time inversely proportional to\na function of its observation. The resulting scheme combines the advantages\noffered by the counting rule (efficient utilization of the network's\ncommunication bandwidth, since the local decisions are transmitted in binary\nform to the fusion center) and ordering sensor transmissions (bandwidth\nefficiency, since the fusion center need not wait for all the $N$ sensors to\ntransmit their local decisions), thereby leading to significant energy savings.\nAs a concrete example, the problem of target detection in large-scale wireless\nsensor networks is considered. Under certain conditions the ordering-based\ncounting rule scheme achieves the same detection performance as that of the\noriginal counting rule detector with fewer than $N/2$ sensor transmissions; in\nsome cases, the savings in transmission approaches $(N-1)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 02:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Due to the\nstrong line-of-sight (LoS) air-to-ground (A2G) channels, the UAV may\nimpose/suffer more severe uplink/downlink interference to/from the cellular\nbase stations (BSs) than the ground users. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nto apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to the uplink\ncommunication from a UAV to cellular BSs, under spectrum sharing with the\nexisting ground users. However, for our considered system, traditional NOMA\nwith local interference cancellation (IC), termed non-cooperative NOMA, may\nprovide very limited gain compared to the OMA. This is because there are many\nco-channel BSs due to the LoS A2G channels and thus the UAV's rate performance\nis severely limited by the BS with the worst channel condition with the UAV. To\nimprove the UAV's achievable rate, a new cooperative NOMA scheme is proposed by\nexploiting the backhaul links among BSs. Specifically, some BSs with better\nchannel conditions are selected to decode the UAV's signals first, and then\nforward the decoded signals to their backhaul-connected BSs for IC. To\ninvestigate the optimal design of cooperative NOMA, we maximize the weighted\nsum-rate of the UAV and ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV's rate and\npower allocations over multiple resource blocks. However, this problem is hard\nto be solved optimally. To obtain useful insights, we first consider two\nspecial cases with egoistic and altruistic transmission strategies of the UAV,\nrespectively, and solve their corresponding problems optimally. Next, we\nconsider the general case and propose an efficient suboptimal solution via the\nalternating optimization. Numerical results show that the proposed cooperative\nNOMA yields significant throughput gains than the OMA and the non-cooperative\nNOMA benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 02:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 01:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 02:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

This question of `when to\nmeasure?' presents a very interesting strategic problem. We develop a\ngame-theoretic model of a multiplayer quantum race, and find an approximate\nNash equilibrium where all players play the same strategy.

For CTR prediction model, it is necessary to capture the latent user\ninterest behind the user behavior data. Besides, considering the changing of\nthe external environment and the internal cognition, user interest evolves over\ntime dynamically. There are several CTR prediction methods for interest\nmodeling, while most of them regard the representation of behavior as the\ninterest directly, and lack specially modeling for latent interest behind the\nconcrete behavior. Moreover, few work consider the changing trend of interest.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel model, named Deep Interest Evolution\nNetwork~(DIEN), for CTR prediction.

Whisper makes use of synchronous\ntransmissions, a technique first introduced by the Glossy flooding protocol. In\ncontrast to Glossy, Whisper does not let the radio switch from receive to\ntransmit mode between messages. Instead, it makes nodes continuously transmit\nidentical copies of the message and eliminates the gaps between subsequent\ntransmissions. To this end, Whisper embeds the message to be flooded into a\nsignaling packet that is composed of multiple packlets -- where a packlet is a\nportion of the message payload that mimics the structure of an actual packet. A\nnode must intercept only one of the packlets to detect that there is an ongoing\ntransmission and that it should start forwarding the message. This allows\nWhisper to speed up the propagation of the flood, and thus, to reduce the\noverall radio-on time of the nodes. Our evaluation on the FlockLab testbed\nshows that Whisper achieves comparable reliability but 2x lower radio-on time\nthan Glossy.

The most common method for\ntraining recurrent neural networks, back-propagation through time (BPTT),\nrequires credit information to be propagated backwards through every single\nstep of the forward computation, potentially over thousands or millions of time\nsteps. This becomes computationally expensive or even infeasible when used with\nlong sequences. Importantly, biological brains are unlikely to perform such\ndetailed reverse replay over very long sequences of internal states (consider\ndays, months, or years.) However, humans are often reminded of past memories or\nmental states which are associated with the current mental state. We consider\nthe hypothesis that such memory associations between past and present could be\nused for credit assignment through arbitrarily long sequences, propagating the\ncredit assigned to the current state to the associated past state.

When the subgroup is characterized by the absence\nof certain post-randomization events, a naive analysis on the subset of\npatients without these events may be misleading. The principal stratification\nframework allows one to define an appropriate causal estimand in such settings.\nStatistical inference for the principal stratum estimand hinges on\nscientifically justified assumptions, which can be included with Bayesian\nmethods through prior distributions. Our motivating example is a large\nrandomized placebo-controlled trial of siponimod in patients with secondary\nprogressive multiple sclerosis. The primary objective of this trial was to\ndemonstrate the efficacy of siponimod relative to placebo in delaying\ndisability progression for the whole study population. However, the treatment\neffect in the subgroup of patients who would not relapse during the trial is\nrelevant from both a scientific and regulatory perspective. Assessing this\nsubgroup treatment effect is challenging as there is strong evidence that\nsiponimod reduces relapses. Aligned with the draft regulatory guidance ICH\nE9(R1), we describe in detail the scientific question of interest, the\nprincipal stratum estimand, the corresponding analysis method for binary\nendpoints and sensitivity analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 08:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Using the result of instrument calibration, a\nlarge part of the contaminating signals are removed and the resulting residual\ndata is further analyzed in order to detect the 21-cm signal. Direction\ndependent calibration (DDC) can strongly affect the 21-cm signal, however, its\neffect has not been precisely quantified.\n  In the analysis presented here we show how to exactly calculate what part of\nthe 21-cm signal is removed as a result of the DDC.

Due to the sparse nature\nof these networks, trust information between any two users may not be always\navailable. To infer the missing trust values, one well-known approach is path\nbased trust estimation, which suggests a user to believe all of its neighbors\nin the network. In this context, we propose two threshold-based heuristics to\novercome the limitation of computation for the path based trust inference. It\nuses the propagation phenomena of trust and decides a threshold value to select\na subset of users for trust propagation. While the first heuristic creates the\ninferred network considering only the subset of users, the second one is able\nto preserve the density of the inferred network coming from all users\nselection. We implement the heuristics and analyze the inferred networks with\ntwo real-world datasets.

Relative\nmagnetic helicity can be decomposed uniquely into two gauge invariant\nquantities, the magnetic helicity of the non-potential component of the field,\nand a complementary volume-threading helicity. Recent analysis of numerical\nexperiments simulating the generation of solar eruptions have shown that the\nratio of the non-potential helicity to the total relative helicity is a clear\nmarker of the eruptivity of the magnetic system, and that the high value of\nthat quantity could be a sufficient condition for the onset of the instability\ngenerating the eruptions. The present study introduces the first analytical\nexamination of the time variations of these non-potential and volume-threading\nhelicities. The validity of the analytical formulas derived are confirmed with\nanalysis of three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of\nsolar coronal dynamics. Both the analytical investigation, and the numerical\napplication show that, unlike magnetic helicity, the non-potential and the\nvolume-threading helicities are not conserved quantities, even in the ideal MHD\nregime. A term corresponding to the transformation between the non-potential\nand volume-threading helicities frequently dominates their dynamics. This\nfinding has an important consequence for their estimation in the solar corona:\nunlike with relative helicity, their volume coronal evolution cannot be\nascertained by the flux of these quantities through the volume's boundaries.\nOnly techniques extrapolating the 3D coronal field will enable both the proper\nstudy of the non-potential and volume-threading helicities, and the\nobservational analysis of helicity-based solar-eruptivity proxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 09:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

High accuracy solutions are desired, and the discontinuous\nGalerkin (DG) method is one of the better ways of delivering high accuracy in\nCED. Maxwell's equations have a pair of involution constraints for which\nmimetic schemes that globally satisfy the constraints at a discrete level are\nhighly desirable. Balsara and Kappeli presented a von Neumann stability\nanalysis of globally constraint-preserving DG schemes for CED up to 4'th order\nwhich was focused on developing the theory and documenting the superior\ndissipation and dispersion of DGTD schemes in media with constant permittivity\nand permeability. In this paper we present DGTD schemes for CED that go up to\n5'th order of accuracy and analyze their performance when permittivity and\npermeability vary strongly in space. Our DGTD schemes achieve constraint\npreservation by collocating the electric displacement and magnetic induction as\nwell as their higher order modes in the faces of the mesh. Our first finding is\nthat at 4'th and higher orders, one has to evolve some zone-centered modes in\naddition to the face-centered modes. It is well-known that the limiting step in\nDG schemes causes a reduction of the optimal accuracy of the scheme. In this\npaper we document simulations where permittivity and permeability vary by\nalmost an order of magnitude without requiring any limiting of the DG scheme.\nThis very favorable finding ensures that DGTD schemes retain optimal accuracy\neven in the presence of large spatial variations in permittivity/permeability.\nOur third finding shows that the electromagnetic energy is conserved very well\neven when permittivity and permeability vary strongly in space; as long as the\nconductivity is zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 12:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The values of\nthe particles' relative density (1.5) and of the Galileo number (180) are such\nthat strong wake-induced particle clustering would occur in the absence of\nturbulence. The forced turbulence in the two present cases (with Taylor-scale\nReynolds number 95 and 140) would lead to mild levels of clustering in the\nabsence of gravity. Here we detect a tendency to cluster with an intensity\nwhich is intermediate between these two limiting cases, meaning that forced\nbackground turbulence decreases the level of clustering otherwise observed\nunder ambient settling. However, the clustering strength does not monotonously\ndecay with the relative turbulence intensity. Various mechanisms by which\ncoherent structures can affect particle motion are discussed. It is argued that\nthe reduced interaction time due to particle settling through the surrounding\neddy (crossing trajectories) has the effect of shifting upwards the range of\neddies with a time scale matching the characteristic time scale of the\nparticle. In the present cases this shift might bring the particles into\nresonance with the energetic eddies of the turbulent spectrum.

Its physics goals are broad; its primary aim to\nmeasure the neutrino mass ordering demands to collect large statistics, which\nrequires JUNO's 20 kt sensitive mass, and achieve an unprecedented energy\nresolution (3$\\%/\\sqrt{E}$). Thanks to these characteristics, JUNO is in a very\ngood position to contribute to the solar neutrino studies in the line of\nprevious experiments of similar technology. It will collect a large sample of\nneutrinos from $^7$Be and $^8$B. In particular, for $^7$Be the target energy\nresolution will provide a powerful tool to isolate the electron energy end\npoint from backgrounds like $^{210}$Bi and $^{85}$Kr. At the same time,\nchallenges will have to be faced mainly related to the reduction and estimation\nof the backgrounds.

Another difficulty of UCC is a growth of the\nnumber of simultaneously entangled qubits even at the fixed fermionic\nexcitation rank.

For tracks that do not\nmerge or split (termed \"solitary\"), many of these quantities show generic,\noften nearly linear relations that hardly depend on the forcing conditions of\nthe simulations, such as surface temperature. This finding allows us to propose\na highly idealized model of rain events, where the surface precipitation area\nis circular and a cell's precipitation intensity falls off linearly with the\ndistance from the respective cell center. The drop-off gradient is nearly\nindependent of track duration and cell size, which allows for a generic\ndescription of such solitary tracks, with the only remaining parameter the peak\nintensity. In contrast to the simple and robust behavior of solitary tracks,\ntracks that result from merging of two or more cells show a much more\ncomplicated behavior.

The\nUlery et al.'s estimate of the FPR is supported by the results of the extensive\nstudy of the overall fingerprint examination process by Langenburg. In 2014,\nthe Miami Dade Police Department (MDPD) Forensic Services Bureau conducted\nresearch to study the false positive error rate associated with latent\nfingerprint examination. They report that approximately 3.0% of latent\nfingerprint examinations result in a false positive conclusion. Their estimate\nof the FPR becomes as high as 4.2% when inconclusive decisions are excluded\nfrom the calculation. In their 2016 report, the President's Council of Advisors\non Science and Technology (PCAST) proposes that the MDPD FPR estimate be used\nto inform jurors that errors occur at a detectable rate in fingerprint\nexamination; more specifically, they declare that false positives may occur as\noften as 1 in 18 cases. The large discrepancy between the FPR estimates\nreported by Ulery et al. and Langenburg on the one hand, and the MDPD on the\nother hand, causes a great deal of controversy. In this paper, we review the\nMDPD study and the various error rate calculations that have been proposed to\ninterpret its data. To assess the appropriateness of the different proposed\nestimates, we develop a model that re-creates the MDPD study. This model allows\nus to estimate the expected number of false positive conclusions that should be\nobtained with any proposed FPR and compare this number to the actual number of\nerroneous identifications observed by MDPD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:09:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 16:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

To avoid accidents and achieve a highly\nefficient traffic flow, it is important to detect VRUs and to predict their\nintentions. In this article a holistic approach for detecting intentions of\nVRUs by cooperative methods is presented. The intention detection consists of\nbasic movement primitive prediction, e.g. standing, moving, turning, and a\nforecast of the future trajectory. Vehicles equipped with sensors, data\nprocessing systems and communication abilities, referred to as intelligent\nvehicles, acquire and maintain a local model of their surrounding traffic\nenvironment, e.g. crossing cyclists. Heterogeneous, open sets of agents\n(cooperating and interacting vehicles, infrastructure, e.g. cameras and laser\nscanners, and VRUs equipped with smart devices and body-worn sensors) exchange\ninformation forming a multi-modal sensor system with the goal to reliably and\nrobustly detect VRUs and their intentions under consideration of real time\nrequirements and uncertainties. The resulting model allows to extend the\nperceptual horizon of the individual agent beyond their own sensory\ncapabilities, enabling a longer forecast horizon. Concealments,\nimplausibilities and inconsistencies are resolved by the collective\nintelligence of cooperating agents. Novel techniques of signal processing and\nmodelling in combination with analytical and learning based approaches of\npattern and activity recognition are used for detection, as well as intention\nprediction of VRUs. Cooperation, by means of probabilistic sensor and knowledge\nfusion, takes place on the level of perception and intention recognition. Based\non the requirements of the cooperative approach for the communication a new\nstrategy for an ad hoc network is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

As a main technical ingredient we prove an optimal local law at the\ncusp for both symmetry classes. This result is also used in the companion paper\n[arXiv:1811.04055] where the cusp universality for real symmetric Wigner-type\nmatrices is proven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 15:27:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 16:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Smart\ncontracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in\nlaw, business, commerce, and governance.\n  Smart contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as\nEthereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for\ndeployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously\nexecuted, usually by a %Turing-complete virtual machine. As with all programs,\nsmart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient\nprogramming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy\ncompilers. At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often\ncommanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need\nsecurity frameworks capable of analysing low-level bytecode to detect potential\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n  In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum\nsmart contracts. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts\nlow-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations.\nUsers of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion:\na security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the\n\\souffle language.

Determining the time-dependent absorptance of the laser light by\na material is important, not only for gaining a fundamental understanding of\nthe light-matter interaction, but also for improving process design in\nmanufacturing. Measurements of the dynamic optical absorptance are notoriously\ndifficult due to the rapidly changing nature of the absorbing medium.

While our algorithm has been developed primarily for the\nfield of exoplanets, it is easily adaptable and extendable for use in any time\nseries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 07:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

It is based on the\nincorporation of higher-order gradients (in the form of Laplacians) in the\nclassical constitutive equations multiplied by appropriate internal lengths\naccounting for the geometry/topology of underlying micro/nano structures. This\nreview will focus on the fractional generalization of the gradient elasticity\nequations (GradEla) an extension of classical elasticity to incorporate the\nLaplacian of Hookean stress by replacing the standard Laplacian by its\nfractional counterpart. On introducing the resulting fractional constitutive\nequation into the classical static equilibrium equation for the stress, a\nfractional differential equation is obtained whose fundamental solutions are\nderived by using the Greens function procedure. As an example, Kelvins problem\nis analyzed within the aforementioned setting. Then, an extension to consider\nconstitutive equations for a restrictive class of nonlinear elastic\ndeformations and deformation theory of plasticity is pursued. Finally, the\nmethodology is applied for extending the authors higher-order diffusion theory\nfrom the integer to the fractional case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 09:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}
