And when analyzing such\nchallenging setups of fluid-structure interaction that include contact of\nsubmersed solid components it gets obvious that the influence of surface\nroughness effects is essential for a physical consistent modeling of such\nconfigurations. To capture this system behavior, we present a continuum\nmechanical model which is able to include the effects of the surface\nmicrostructure in a fluid-structure-contact interaction framework. An averaged\nrepresentation for the mixture of fluid and solid on the rough surfaces, which\nis of major interest for the macroscopic response of such a system, is\nintroduced therein. The inherent coupling of the macroscopic fluid flow and the\nflow inside the rough surfaces, the stress exchange of all contacting solid\nbodies involved, and the interaction between fluid and solid is included in the\nconstruction of the model. Although the physical model is not restricted to\nfinite element based methods, a numerical approach with its core based on the\nCut Finite Element Method (CutFEM), enabling topological changes of the fluid\ndomain to solve the presented model numerically, is introduced.

The outer planets' orbits are thought to\nhave become unstable during the early stages with Jupiter having scattering\nencounters with a Neptune-class planet. As a consequence, Jupiter jumped inward\nby a fraction of an au, as required from inner solar system constraints, and\nobtained its current orbital eccentricity. The timing of these events is often\nlinked to the lunar Late Heavy Bombardment that ended ~700 Myr after the\ndispersal of the protosolar nebula (t_0). Here we show instead that planetary\nmigration started shortly after t_0. Such early migration is inferred from the\nsurvival of the Patroclus-Menoetius binary Jupiter Trojan.

The\nlonger the binary stayed in the disk, the greater the likelihood that\ncollisions would strip its components from one another.

This result generalizes the classical result of the traditional\nt-distribution where the underlying discrete time process follows an\nuncorrelated normal distribution. However, for AR(1), the underlying process is\ncorrelated. All traditional results break down and the resulting t-statistic is\na new distribution that converges asymptotically to a normal. We give an\nexplicit formula for this new distribution obtained as the ratio of two\ndependent distribution (a normal and the distribution of the norm of another\nindependent normal distribution). We also provide a modified statistic that\nfollows a non central t-distribution. Its derivation comes from finding an\northogonal basis for the the initial circulant Toeplitz covariance matrix. Our\nfindings are consistent with the asymptotic distribution for the t-statistic\nderived for the asympotic case of large number of observations or zero\ncorrelation. This exact finding of this distribution has applications in\nmultiple fields and in particular provides a way to derive the exact\ndistribution of the Sharpe ratio under normal AR(1) assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 16:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

In this paper, we introduce planning algorithms for\nmulti-target tracking that are resilient to such failures. In general,\nresilient target tracking is computationally hard. Contrary to the case where\nthere are no failures, no scalable approximation algorithms are known for\nresilient target tracking when the targets are indistinguishable, or unknown in\nnumber, or with unknown motion model.

Second, it\nis scalable, as our algorithm terminates with the same running time as\nstate-of-the-art algorithms for (non-resilient) target tracking.

We find that inhomogeneous disorder, such as that introduced by\ninfusion of Nitrogen into the surface layers of Niobium SRF cavities, can\nincrease the superheating field above the maximum for superconductors in the\nclean limit or with homogeneously distributed disorder. Homogeneous disorder\nincreases the penetration of screening current, but also suppresses the maximum\nsupercurrent. Inhomogeneous disorder in the form of an impurity diffusion layer\nbiases this trade-off by increasing the penetration of the screening currents\ninto cleaner regions with larger critical currents, thus limiting the\nsuppression of the screening current to a thin dirty region close to the\nsurface. Our results suggest that the impurity diffusion layers play a role in\nenhancing the maximum accelerating gradient of Nitrogen treated Niobium SRF\ncavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 17:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Here, the development of a\nheavy Fermi liquid requires a channel symmetry breaking spinorial hybridization\nthat breaks both single and double time-reversal symmetry, and is known as\nhastatic order. Motivated by cubic Pr-based materials with $\\Gamma_3$\nnon-Kramers ground state doublets, this paper provides a survey of cubic\nhastatic order using the simple two-channel Kondo-Heisenberg model. Hastatic\norder necessarily breaks time-reversal symmetry, but the spatial arrangement of\nthe hybridization spinor can be either uniform (ferrohastatic) or break\nadditional lattice symmetries (antiferrohastatic). The experimental signatures\nof both orders are presented in detail, and include tiny conduction electron\nmagnetic moments. Interestingly, there can be several distinct\nantiferrohastatic orders with the same moment pattern that break different\nlattice symmetries, revealing a potential experimental route to detect the\nspinorial nature of the hybridization. We employ an SU(N) fermionic mean-field\ntreatment on square and simple cubic lattices, and examine how the nature and\nstability of hastatic order varies as we vary the Heisenberg coupling,\nconduction electron density, band degeneracies, and apply both channel and spin\nsymmetry breaking fields.

To achieve a considerable speed-up, a hyper-reduction step is needed\nto reduce the computational complexity due to nonlinear terms. Many\nhyper-reduction techniques require the construction of nonlinear term basis,\nwhich introduces a computationally expensive offline phase. A novel way of\nconstructing nonlinear term basis within the hyper-reduction process is\nintroduced. In contrast to the traditional hyper-reduction techniques where the\ncollection of nonlinear term snapshots is required, the SNS method avoids\ncollecting the nonlinear term snapshots. Instead, it uses the solution\nsnapshots that are used for building a solution basis, which enables avoiding\nan extra data compression of nonlinear term snapshots. As a result, the SNS\nmethod provides a more efficient offline strategy than the traditional model\norder reduction techniques, such as the DEIM, GNAT, and ST-GNAT methods. The\nSNS method is theoretically justified by the conforming subspace condition and\nthe subspace inclusion relation. It is useful for model order reduction of\nlarge-scale nonlinear dynamical problems to reduce the offline cost.

The cutoff energy ($E_{\\rm C}$) of the primary X-ray continuum emission\ncarries important information on the physical characteristics of the X-ray\nemitting plasma, but little is currently known about its potential relation\nwith the properties of accreting SMBHs.

We assessed four-planet orbit models with different levels of\nconstraints and found that assuming the planets are near 1:2:4:8 period\ncommensurabilities, or are coplanar, does not worsen the fit. We added the\nprior that the planets must have been stable for the age of the system (40 Myr)\nby running orbit configurations from our posteriors through $N$-body\nsimulations and varying the masses of the planets. We found that only assuming\nthe planets are both coplanar and near 1:2:4:8 period commensurabilities\nproduces dynamically stable orbits in large quantities. Our posterior of stable\ncoplanar orbits tightly constrains the planets' orbits, and we discuss\nimplications for the outermost planet b shaping the debris disk. A four-planet\nresonance lock is not necessary for stability up to now.

Several studies showed that\nrecommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker\ninjects fake data to a given system such that the system makes recommendations\nas the attacker desires. However, these poisoning attacks are either agnostic\nto recommendation algorithms or optimized to recommender systems that are not\ngraph-based. Like association-rule-based and matrix-factorization-based\nrecommender systems, graph-based recommender system is also deployed in\npractice, e.g., eBay, Huawei App Store. However, how to design optimized\npoisoning attacks for graph-based recommender systems is still an open problem.\nIn this work, we perform a systematic study on poisoning attacks to graph-based\nrecommender systems. Due to limited resources and to avoid detection, we assume\nthe number of fake users that can be injected into the system is bounded. The\nkey challenge is how to assign rating scores to the fake users such that the\ntarget item is recommended to as many normal users as possible. To address the\nchallenge, we formulate the poisoning attacks as an optimization problem,\nsolving which determines the rating scores for the fake users. We also propose\ntechniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and\ncompare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm\nand its parameters are known), gray-box (recommendation algorithm is known but\nits parameters are unknown), and black-box (recommendation algorithm is\nunknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our\nattack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based\nrecommender systems. For instance, when 1% fake users are injected, our attack\ncan make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 19:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

We resolve the asymmetric disk into a symmetric ring + asymmetric\ncrescent, and observe that: (1) the spectral index strongly decreases at the\ncenter of the vortex, consistent with the presence of large grains; (2) for the\nfirst time, an azimuthal shift of the peak of the vortex with wavelength is\nobserved; (3) the azimuthal width of the vortex decreases at longer\nwavelengths, as expected for dust traps.

The\nabundance of hydrogen atoms measured in the densest regions of molecular clouds\ncan be only explained by the dissociation of H$_2$ due to cosmic rays. We want\nto assess the role of Galactic cosmic rays in the formation of atomic hydrogen,\nby using recent developments in the characterisation of the low-energy spectra\nof cosmic rays and advances in the modelling of their propagation in molecular\nclouds. We model the attenuation of the interstellar cosmic rays entering a\ncloud and compute the dissociation rate of molecular hydrogen due to collisions\nwith cosmic-ray protons and electrons as well as fast hydrogen atoms. We\ncompare our results with the available observations. The cosmic-ray\ndissociation rate is entirely determined by secondary electrons produced in\nprimary ionisation collisions. These secondary particles constitute the only\nsource of atomic hydrogen at column densities above $\\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. We\nalso find that the dissociation rate decreases with column density, while the\nratio between the dissociation and ionisation rates varies between about 0.6\nand 0.7. From comparison with observations we conclude that a relatively flat\nspectrum of interstellar cosmic-ray protons, as the one suggested by the most\nrecent Voyager 1 data, can only provide a lower bound for the observed atomic\nhydrogen fraction. An enhanced spectrum of low-energy protons is needed to\nexplain most of the observations.

An accurate characterisation of this process at\nhigh densities is crucial for understanding the chemical evolution of\nstar-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 21:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

However, current classification methods all ignore an\nimportant and inevitable problem---labels may be corrupted and collecting clean\nlabels for training samples is difficult, and often impractical. Therefore, how\nto learn from the database with noisy labels is a problem of great practical\nimportance. In this paper, we study the influence of label noise on\nhyperspectral image classification, and develop a random label propagation\nalgorithm (RLPA) to cleanse the label noise. The key idea of RLPA is to exploit\nknowledge (e.g., the superpixel based spectral-spatial constraints) from the\nobserved hyperspectral images and apply it to the process of label propagation.\nSpecifically, RLPA first constructs a spectral-spatial probability transfer\nmatrix (SSPTM) that simultaneously considers the spectral similarity and\nsuperpixel based spatial information. It then randomly chooses some training\nsamples as \"clean\" samples and sets the rest as unlabeled samples, and\npropagates the label information from the \"clean\" samples to the rest unlabeled\nsamples with the SSPTM. By repeating the random assignment (of \"clean\" labeled\nsamples and unlabeled samples) and propagation, we can obtain multiple labels\nfor each training sample. Therefore, the final propagated label can be\ncalculated by a majority vote algorithm. Experimental studies show that RLPA\ncan reduce the level of noisy label and demonstrates the advantages of our\nproposed method over four major classifiers with a significant margin---the\ngains in terms of the average OA, AA, Kappa are impressive, e.g., 9.18%, 9.58%,\nand 0.1043.

Without considering the\ninfluences of the evolving market structure to the market index trends, these\nmethods hardly obtain the market structure models which are compatible with the\nmarket principles. Advancements in deep learning have shown their incredible\nmodeling capacity on various finance-related tasks. However, the learned inner\nparameters, which capture the essence of the finance time series, are not\nfurther exploited about their representation in the financial fields. In this\nwork, we model the financial market structure as a deep co-investment network\nand propose a Deep Co-investment Network Learning (DeepCNL) method. DeepCNL\nautomatically learns deep co-investment patterns between any pairwise stocks,\nwhere the rise-fall trends of the market index are used for distance\nsupervision. The learned inner parameters of the trained DeepCNL, which encodes\nthe temporal dynamics of deep co-investment patterns, are used to build the\nco-investment network between the stocks as the investment structure of the\ncorresponding market. We verify the effectiveness of DeepCNL on the real-world\nstock data and compare it with the existing methods on several financial tasks.\nThe experimental results show that DeepCNL not only has the ability to better\nreflect the stock market structure that is consistent with widely-acknowledged\nfinancial principles but also is more capable to approximate the investment\nactivities which lead to the stock performance reported in the real news or\nresearch reports than other alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 02:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

Understanding\nthe fundamental features leading to such rheological changes in dense\nsuspensions is crucial to optimize flow conditions or to design flow modifiers\nfor slurry processing. While local changes to the particle environment under an\napplied shear can be related to changes in viscosity, there is a broader need\nto connect the shear thickening transition to the fundamental organization of\nparticle-interaction forces which lead to long-range organization. In\nparticular, at a high volume fraction of particles, recent evidence indicates\nfrictional forces between contacting particles is of importance. Herein, the\nnetwork of frictional contact forces is analyzed within simulated\ntwo-dimensional shear thickening suspensions. Two topological metrics are\nstudied to characterize the response of the contact force network (CFN) under\nvarying applied shear stress. The metrics, geodesic index and the void\nparameter, reflect complementary aspects of the CFN: one is the connectedness\nof the contact network and the second is the distribution of spatial areas\ndevoid of particle-particle contacts. Considered in relation to the variation\nof the viscosity, the topological metrics show that the network grows\nhomogeneously at large scales but with many local regions devoid of contacts,\nindicating clearly the role of stress chain growth in causing the large change\nin the rheological response at the shear thickening transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 03:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Specifically, when the wireless medium is\nperceived by a station to be busy, a carrier sensing compliant station will\navoid transmission while a RRJ station will often initiate transmission.\nHowever, hidden terminals (HTs), i.e., activity detected by the AP but not by\nthe sensing station, complicate the use of carrier sensing as the basis for RRJ\ndetection since they provide plausible deniability to a station suspected of\nbeing an RRJ.

We first train a single or a small set\nof MotherNets and, subsequently, we generate the target ensemble networks by\ntransferring the function from the trained MotherNet(s). Then, we continue to\ntrain these ensemble networks, which now converge drastically faster compared\nto training from scratch.

In this study we\nattempt to reasonably explain the Lyman excess phenomenon in as many of the 67\nH II regions as possible through a variety of observational and astrophysical\nmeans including new luminosity estimates, new Herschel photometry, new distance\ndeterminations, the use of different models for dust and ionized gas covering\nfactors, and the use of different stellar calibrations. This phenomenon has\nbeen observed before; however, the objects shown to exhibit this behaviour in\nthe literature have decidedly different physical properties than the regions in\nour sample, and thus the origin of the excess is not the same. We find that the\nexcess can be reproduced using OB stellar atmosphere models that have been\nslightly modified in the extreme ultraviolet.

We first classify human instructions\ninto three types: the goal, the constraints, and uninformative phrases. Next,\nwe provide grounding for the extracted goal and constraint items in a dynamic\nmanner along with the navigation process, to deal with the target objects that\nare too far away for sensor observation and the appearance of moving obstacles\nlike humans. In particular, for a goal phrase (e.g., \"go to the restaurant\"),\nwe ground it to a location in a predefined semantic map and treat it as a goal\nfor a global motion planner, which plans a collision-free path in the workspace\nfor the robot to follow. For a constraint phrase (e.g., \"keep away from\npeople\"), we dynamically add the corresponding constraint into a local planner\nby adjusting the values of a local costmap according to the results returned by\nthe object detection module.

By\ncombining natural language processing, motion planning, and computer vision,\nour developed system is demonstrated to be able to successfully follow natural\nlanguage navigation instructions to achieve navigation tasks in both simulated\nand real-world scenarios.

Another attractive feature\nof the proposed method is that the explicit time step does not need to be\nreduced relative to the corresponding periodic problem. Numerical experiments,\nboth for smoothly varying and discontinuous material properties, demonstrate\nthat the proposed method converges to fourth order accuracy.

We find a\nclear bimodality in stellar age and metallicity within the population of S0s\nand this is strongly correlated with stellar mass. Old and metal-rich bulges\nand disks belong to massive galaxies, and young and metal-poor bulges and disks\nare hosted by low-mass galaxies. From this we conclude that the bulges and\ndisks are co-evolving.

However, under the same plasma\nconditions, for elements with similar FIPs such as Mg, Si, and Fe, comparable\nenhancements are expected. We scrutinize the assumption that the FIP effect is\nalways similar for different low FIP elements, namely Mg, Si, and Fe. We\ninvestigate the dependency of the FIP effect of low FIP elements on the O7+/O6+\ncharge state ratio depending on time and solar wind type. We order the observed\nFIP ratios with respect to the O7+/O6+ charge state ratio into bins and analyze\nseparately the respective distributions of the FIP ratio of Mg, Si, and Fe for\neach O7+/O6+ charge state ratio bin. We observe that the FIP effect shows the\nsame qualitative yearly behavior for Mg and Si, while Fe shows significant\ndifferences during the solar activity maximum and its declining phase. In each\nyear, the FIP effect for Mg and Si always increases with increasing O7+/O6+\ncharge state ratio, but for high O7+/O6+ charge state ratios the FIP effect for\nFe shows a qualitatively different behavior. During the years 2001-2006,\ninstead of increasing with the O7+/O6+ charge state ratio, the Fe FIP ratio\nexhibits a broad peak. Also, the FIP distribution per O7+/O6+ charge state bin\nis significantly broader for Fe than for Mg and Si. These observations support\nthe conclusion that the elemental fractionation is only partly determined by\nFIP.

Such genes are usually referred to as circadian, and\ntheir identification is a crucial step toward discovering physiological\nprocesses that are clock-controlled. It is natural to expect that the\nexpression of gene i at time j might depend to some degree on the expression of\nthe other genes measured at the same time. However, widely-used rhythmicity\ndetection techniques do not accommodate for the potential dependence across\ngenes. We develop a Bayesian approach for periodicity identification that\nexplicitly takes into account the complex dependence structure across\ntime-course trajectories in gene expressions.

This provides basis to get, in theory, a complete description\nof a combinatorial polytope induced by any COP: all facet inducing inequalities\nfor $conv(X)$ can be written as $hx\\le l$ where $h\\in V$ and $l$ is integer. A\nvector $h\\in V$ induces a nonredundent facet if and only if $h\\in H_k^o$ $\\in\nH_k$ for at least one $x_k\\in X\\ $(where $H_k^o$$=\\{h\\in H_k:h\\notin\ncone(H_k\\setminus \\{h\\})\\}$ ) and $l=\\ $ $x_kh$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 11:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

These spinors are related to Elko (flag-pole spinors) by a\none-parameter matrix transformation $\\mathcal{Z}(z)$ where $z$ is a complex\nnumber. The theory is non-local and non-covariant. While it is possible to\nobtain a Lorentz-invariant theory via $\\tau$-deformation, we choose to study\nthe effects of non-locality and non-covariance. Our motivation for doing so is\nexplained. We show that a fermionic field with $|z|\\neq1$ and $|z|=1$ are\nphysically equivalent. But for fermionic fields with more than one value of\n$z$, their interactions are $z$-dependent thus introducing an additional\nfermionic degeneracy that is absent in the Lorentz-invariant theory. We study\nthe fermionic self-interaction and the local $U(1)$ interaction. In the\nprocess, we obtained non-local contributions for fermionic self-interaction\nthat have previously been neglected. For the local $U(1)$ theory, the\ninteractions contain time derivatives that renders the interacting density\nnon-commutative at space-like separation. We show that this problem can be\nresolved by working in the temporal gauge.

In this paper, we introduce a natural and\nexpressive way to tackle these problems, by incorporating GPs in sum-product\nnetworks (SPNs), a recently proposed tractable probabilistic model allowing\nexact and efficient inference. In particular, by using GPs as leaves of an SPN\nwe obtain a novel flexible prior over functions, which implicitly represents an\nexponentially large mixture of local GPs. Exact and efficient posterior\ninference in this model can be done in a natural interplay of the inference\nmechanisms in GPs and SPNs.

The two most important contributions to the\ndeformation energy have their origin in shell effects that are correlated to\nthe spectrum of single-particle states, and the deformability of nuclear\nmatter, that can be characterized by a model-dependent surface energy\ncoefficient a_{surf}.\n  With the goal of improving the global performance of nuclear EDFs through\nfine-tuning of their deformation properties, the purpose of this study is\nthreefold.

In energy space,\nthe quantum states of the conduction electrons cross over the metal's Fermi\nenergy continuously. But when gold is dispersed in finite nanometer-size\nparticles or 'clusters', the delocalized electronic states are re-grouped in\nenergy space to 'shells' according to allowed energy levels and the symmetry\nand shape of the atomic arrangement. This re-grouping generates also an energy\ngap in the vicinity of the Fermi energy akin to the energy gap between occupied\nand unoccupied electron orbitals in molecules. How does the formation of these\nshells and the energy gap affect the physico-chemical properties of the\nnanoparticle? How does one get from a 'molecule-like' gold nanoparticle to\n'metal-like' gold nanoparticle? Here we analyse the electronic structure and\noptical and chiroptical properties of recently reported gold nanoparticles of\n144, 146, and 246 gold atoms, that are made by wet chemistry methods and whose\nstructures have been resolved to atomic precision.

Classical RSA techniques employ\nthe inverse of the covariance matrix to explore a linear model between the\nneural activities and task events. However, calculating the inverse of a\nlarge-scale covariance matrix is time-consuming and can reduce the stability\nand robustness of the final analysis. Notably, it becomes severe when the\nnumber of samples is too large. For facing this shortcoming, this paper\nproposes a novel RSA method called gradient-based RSA (GRSA). Moreover, the\nproposed method is not restricted to a linear model. In fact, there is a\ngrowing interest in finding more effective ways of using multi-subject and\nwhole-brain fMRI data. Searchlight technique can extend RSA from the localized\nbrain regions to the whole-brain regions with smaller memory footprint in each\nprocess. Based on Searchlight, we propose a new method called Spatiotemporal\nSearchlight GRSA (SSL-GRSA) that generalizes our ROI-based GRSA algorithm to\nthe whole-brain data.

An FHVAE can learn a latent space that separates\nthe more static attributes within an utterance from the more dynamic attributes\nby encoding them into two different sets of latent variables. Useful factors\nfor dialect identification, such as phonetic or linguistic content, are encoded\nby a segmental latent variable, while irrelevant factors that are relatively\nconstant within a sequence, such as a channel or a speaker information, are\nencoded by a sequential latent variable. The disentanglement property makes the\nsegmental latent variable less susceptible to channel and speaker variation,\nand thus reduces degradation from channel domain mismatch. We demonstrate that\non fully-supervised DID tasks, an end-to-end model trained on the features\nextracted from the FHVAE model achieves the best performance, compared to the\nsame model trained on conventional acoustic features and an i-vector based\nsystem.

To overcome their limitations, we propose to learn in the same\nunsupervised manner a depth map inference system from monocular videos that\ntakes a pair of images as input. This algorithm actually learns\nstructure-from-motion from motion, and not only structure from context\nappearance. The scale factor issue is explicitly treated, and the absolute\ndepth map can be estimated from camera displacement magnitude, which can be\neasily measured from cheap external sensors. Our solution is also much more\nrobust with respect to domain variation and adaptation via fine tuning, because\nit does not rely entirely in depth from context. Two use cases are considered,\nunstabilized moving camera videos, and stabilized ones. This choice is\nmotivated by the UAV (for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) use case that generally\nprovides reliable orientation measurement. We provide a set of experiments\nshowing that, used in real conditions where only speed can be known, our\nnetwork outperforms competitors for most depth quality measures. Results are\ngiven on the well known KITTI dataset, which provides robust stabilization for\nour second use case, but also contains moving scenes which are very typical of\nthe in-car road context. We then present results on a synthetic dataset that we\nbelieve to be more representative of typical UAV scenes.

These\nalgorithms are mostly trained one task at the time, each new task requiring to\ntrain a brand new agent instance. This means the learning algorithm is general,\nbut each solution is not; each agent can only solve the one task it was trained\non. In this work, we study the problem of learning to master not one but\nmultiple sequential-decision tasks at once. A general issue in multi-task\nlearning is that a balance must be found between the needs of multiple tasks\ncompeting for the limited resources of a single learning system. Many learning\nalgorithms can get distracted by certain tasks in the set of tasks to solve.\nSuch tasks appear more salient to the learning process, for instance because of\nthe density or magnitude of the in-task rewards. This causes the algorithm to\nfocus on those salient tasks at the expense of generality. We propose to\nautomatically adapt the contribution of each task to the agent's updates, so\nthat all tasks have a similar impact on the learning dynamics. This resulted in\nstate of the art performance on learning to play all games in a set of 57\ndiverse Atari games. Excitingly, our method learned a single trained policy -\nwith a single set of weights - that exceeds median human performance. To our\nknowledge, this was the first time a single agent surpassed human-level\nperformance on this multi-task domain.

Our\nseparation can be formulated in a very general way. It can be applied to very\ndifferent partitionings ranging from those driven by features in the molecular\nstructure (such as a solute surrounded by solvent molecules) to those that aim\nat an orbital separation (such as core-valence separation). Our framework\nembraces recent developments of Manby and Miller as well as older ones of\nHuzinaga and Cantu. Projector-based embedding is simplified and accelerated by\nSSUB. Moreover, it directly relates to decoupling approaches for relativistic\nfour-component many-electron theory. For a Fock operator based on the Dirac\none-electron Hamiltonian, one would like to separate the so-called positronic\n(negative-energy) states from the electronic bound and continuum states. The\nexact two-component (X2C) approach developed for this purpose becomes a special\ncase of the general SSUB framework and may therefore be viewed as a\nsystem-environment decoupling approach. Moreover, for SSUB there exists no\nrestriction with respect to the number of subsystems that are generated - in\nthe limit, decoupling of all single-particle states is recovered, which\nrepresents exact diagonalization of the problem. The fact that a Fock operator\ndepends on its eigenvectors poses challenges to all system-environment\ndecoupling approaches and is discussed in terms of the SSUB framework. Apart\nfrom improved conceptual understanding, these relations bring about technical\nadvances as developments in different fields can immediately cross-fertilize\none another. As an important example we discuss the atomic decomposition of the\nunitary block-diagonalization matrix in X2C-type approaches that can inspire\napproaches for the efficient partitioning of large total systems based on SSUB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:21:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 21:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

While it has not demonstrated an advantage over\nclassical computing on a real-world application, many important regions of the\nQA design space have yet to be explored. In IARPA's Quantum Enhanced\nOptimization (QEO) program, we have opened some new lines of inquiry to get to\nthe heart of QA, and are designing testbed superconducting circuits and\nconducting key experiments. In this paper, we discuss recent experimental\nprogress related to one of the key design dimensions: qubit coherence. Using\nMIT Lincoln Laboratory's qubit fabrication process and extending recent\nprogress in flux qubits, we are implementing and measuring QA-capable flux\nqubits. Achieving high coherence in a QA context presents significant new\nengineering challenges. We report on techniques and preliminary measurement\nresults addressing two of the challenges: crosstalk calibration and qubit\nreadout. This groundwork enables exploration of other promising features and\nprovides a path to understanding the physics and the viability of quantum\nannealing as a computing resource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

In this paper, we study\nhow the popularity drifting speed affects the number of required broadcast\ntransmissions by the MBS and then design coded transmission schemes by\nleveraging the broadcast advantage under the index coding framework. The key\nidea is that files already cached in WCSs, which although may be currently\nunpopular, can serve as side information to facilitate coded broadcast\ntransmission for cache updating. Our algorithm extends existing index\ncoding-based schemes from a single-request scenario to a multiple-request\nscenario via a \"dynamic coloring\" approach.

In this paper, we extend the discipline of\nstructural dynamics to the realm of materials engineering by intrinsically\nbuilding localized substructures within, or attached to, the material domain\nitself$-$which is viewed as an extended medium without defined external\nboundaries. Our system is essentially a locally resonant elastic metamaterial,\nexcept here it is viewed from the perspective of unique dissipation\ncharacteristics rather than subwavelength effective properties or band gaps, as\nwidely done in the literature. We provide a theory, validated by experiments,\nfor substructurally synthesizing the dissipation under the conditions of\nfree-wave motion, i.e., waves not constrained to a prescribed driving\nfrequency. We use an extended elastic beam with attached pillars as an example\nof a metamaterial. When compared to an identical infinite beam with no attached\nsubstructures, we show that within certain frequency ranges the metamaterial\nexhibits either enhanced or reduced dissipation$-$which we refer to as positive\nand negative metadamping, respectively. These regimes are rigorously identified\nand characterized using the metamaterial's band structure and\nwavenumber-dependent dissipation diagram. This theory impacts applications that\nrequire a combination of high stiffness and high damping or, conversely,\napplications that benefit from a reduction in loss without the need to change\nthe backbone constituent material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 15:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-13"}

In continuation of previous work on Mg$^+$He lines in the UV, we\npresent theoretical profiles of the resonance line of neutral Mg perturbed by\nHe at the extreme density conditions found in the cool largely transparent\natmosphere of DZ white dwarfs. We accurately determined the broadening of Mg by\nHe in a unified theory of collisional line profiles using ab initio\ncalculations of MgHe potential energies and transition matrix elements among\nthe singlet electronic states that are involved for the observable spectral\nlines. We computed the shapes and line parameters of the Mg lines and studied\ntheir dependence on helium densities and temperatures. We present results over\nthe full range of temperatures from 4000 to 12000 K needed for input to stellar\nspectra models. Atmosphere models were constructed for a range of effective\ntemperatures and surface gravities typical for cool DZ white dwarfs. We present\nsynthetic spectra tracing the behavior of the Mg resonance line profiles under\nthe low temperatures and high gas pressures prevalent in these atmospheres. The\ndetermination of accurate opacity data of magnesium resonance lines together\nwith an improved atmosphere model code lead to a good fit of cool DZ white\ndwarf stars. The broadening of spectral lines by helium needs to be understood\nto accurately determine the H/He and Mg/He abundance ratio in DZ white dwarf\natmospheres. We emphasize that no free potential parameters or ad hoc\nadjustments were used to calculate the line profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 15:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Treating wCDM, LCDM and R_h=ct as\nseparate models, we find in an unbiased pairwise statistical comparison that\nthe Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) favors the R_h=ct universe with a\nlikelihood of 82.8% versus 17.2% for wCDM, but the ratio of likelihoods is\nreversed (16.2% versus 83.8%) when w_de=-1 (i.e., LCDM) and strongly reversed\n(1.0% versus 99.0%) if in addition k=0 (i.e., flat LCDM). We point out,\nhowever, that the value of k is a measure of the net energy (kinetic plus\ngravitational) in the Universe and is not constrained theoretically, though\nsome models of inflation would drive k to 0 due to an expansion-enforced\ndilution. Since we here consider only the basic LCDM model, the value of k\nneeds to be measured and, therefore, the pre-assumption of flatness introduces\na significant bias into the BIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

The 5060 CHD patients (2365 men and 2695\nwomen) were 1 to 97 years old at baseline with 8 years (2009-2017) of medical\nrecords, 5051 health check-ups and 5075 cases of other diseases.

We built a dataset with 15,000 routine\nblood tests results. Using this dataset, we trained the two-layer GBDT model to\nclassify healthy status, coronary heart disease and other diseases.

There are many existing methods for anomaly detection in network\ntraffic, such as number of packets. However, there is non established method\ndetecting anomalies in a time series of flow interaction patterns that can be\nrepresented as complex network. Firstly, based on proposed multivariate flow\nsimilarity method on temporal locality, a complex network model (MFS-TL) is\nconstructed to describe the interactive behaviors of traffic flows. Having\nanalyzed the relationships between MFS-TL characteristics, temporal locality\nwindow and multivariate flow similarity critical threshold, an approach for\nparameter determination is established. Having observed the evolution of MFS-TL\ncharacteristics, three non-deterministic correlations are defined for network\nstates (i.e. normal or abnormal). Furthermore, intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS)\nis introduced to quantify three non-deterministic correlations, and then a\nanomaly detection method is put forward for single characteristic sequence. To\nbuild an objective IFS, we design a Gaussian distribution-based membership\nfunction with a variable hesitation degree. To determine the mapping of IFS's\nclustering intervals to network states, a distinction index is developed. Then,\nan IFS ensemble method (IFSE-AD) is proposed to eliminate the impacts of the\ninconsistent about MFS-TL characteristic to network state and improve detection\nperformance. Finally, we carried out extensive experiments on several network\ntraffic datasets for anomaly detection, and the results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of IFSE-AD to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the\neffectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 11:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}
