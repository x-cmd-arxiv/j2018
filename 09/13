The starting point of the theory is the notion of covariance which\nis interpreted as (4D) conformal covariance rather than the general\n(diffeomorphism) covariance of general relativity. Fock space which is a graded\nalgebra composed of tensor valued function spaces associated with spaces of\nmultiparticle bosonic or fermionic states is defined concretely. Algebra\nbundles whose typical fibers are algebras such as the Fock algebra are defined.\nScattering processes are associated with linear maps between fibers in such\nbundles. Such linear maps can be generated by linear operators between the\nmultiparticle function spaces which intertwine with the actions of the group\n$SU(3)$ associated with the strong interaction and a group locally isomorphic\nto $SL(2,{\\bf C})\\times U(1)$ which is associated with the electroweak\ninteraction and such intertwining, or covariant, operators may be generated by\ncovariant integral kernels. It is shown how quark-quark scattering and\ngluon-gluon scattering are associated with such covariant kernels. The rest of\nthe paper focuses on QCD vacuum polarization in order to compute and display\nthe QCD running coupling. Through an application of the technique called\nspectral regularization the densities associated with the quark, gluon and\nghost bubbles are computed without requiring renormalization and hence the QCD\nvacuum polarization tensor is determined. It is found that the spectral QCD\nrunning coupling does not manifest a Landau pole and has the property known as\n\"freezing of $\\alpha_s$\" in the infrared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 16:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2018 08:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 23:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 05:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2021 12:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-13"}

To address this accuracy-interpretability challenge, we here\nintroduce, for the first time, a text categorization approach that leverages\nthe recently introduced Tsetlin Machine. In all brevity, we represent the terms\nof a text as propositional variables.

SAD is\nparticularly difficult in environments with acoustic noise. A practical\nsolution is to incorporate visual information, increasing the robustness of the\nSAD approach. An audiovisual system has the advantage of being robust to\ndifferent speech modes (e.g., whisper speech) or background noise. Recent\nadvances in audiovisual speech processing using deep learning have opened\nopportunities to capture in a principled way the temporal relationships between\nacoustic and visual features. This study explores this idea proposing a\n\\emph{bimodal recurrent neural network} (BRNN) framework for SAD. The approach\nmodels the temporal dynamic of the sequential audiovisual data, improving the\naccuracy and robustness of the proposed SAD system. Instead of estimating\nhand-crafted features, the study investigates an end-to-end training approach,\nwhere acoustic and visual features are directly learned from the raw data\nduring training. The experimental evaluation considers a large audiovisual\ncorpus with over 60.8 hours of recordings, collected from 105 speakers. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to absolute improvements\nup to 1.2% under practical scenarios over a VAD baseline using only audio\nimplemented with deep neural network (DNN).

We develop a\nformal model to explore the relationship between the demands of simplicity and\nequity. Although the two concepts appear to be motivated by qualitatively\ndistinct goals, we show a fundamental inconsistency between them. Specifically,\nwe formalize a general framework for producing simple prediction functions, and\nin this framework we establish two basic results. First, every simple\nprediction function is strictly improvable: there exists a more complex\nprediction function that is both strictly more efficient and also strictly more\nequitable. Put another way, using a simple prediction function both reduces\nutility for disadvantaged groups and reduces overall welfare relative to other\noptions. Second, we show that simple prediction functions necessarily create\nincentives to use information about individuals' membership in a disadvantaged\ngroup --- incentives that weren't present before simplification, and that work\nagainst these individuals. Thus, simplicity transforms disadvantage into bias\nagainst the disadvantaged group.

Connections between the two modeling regimes have been studied\nsince the seminal paper by Kurtz (1972), where the deterministic model is shown\nto be a limit of a properly rescaled stochastic model over compact time\nintervals.

Images in the real world often exhibit high\ndegrees of variation in scale, orientation, viewpoint, illumination and affine\nprojection parameters, and are often accompanied by the presence of textureless\nregions and complete or partial occlusion of scene objects. The above\nconditions confound most correspondence determination techniques by rendering\nimpractical the use of global contour-based descriptors or local pixel-level\nfeatures for establishing correspondence. The proposed deep spectral\ncorrespondence (DSC) determination scheme harnesses the representational power\nof local feature descriptors to derive a complex high-level global shape\nrepresentation for matching disparate images. The proposed scheme reasons about\ncorrespondence between disparate images using high-level global shape cues\nderived from low-level local feature descriptors. Consequently, the proposed\nscheme enjoys the best of both worlds, i.e., a high degree of invariance to\naffine parameters such as scale, orientation, viewpoint, illumination afforded\nby the global shape cues and robustness to occlusion provided by the low-level\nfeature descriptors. While the shape-based component within the proposed scheme\ninfers what to look for, an additional saliency-based component dictates where\nto look at thereby tackling the noisy correspondences arising from the presence\nof textureless regions and complex backgrounds. In the proposed scheme, a joint\nimage graph is constructed using distances computed between interest points in\nthe appearance (i.e., image) space. Eigenspectral decomposition of the joint\nimage graph allows for reasoning about shape similarity to be performed\njointly, in the appearance space and eigenspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}

Characterizing DM through its astrophysical\nsignatures will require a robust understanding of its distribution in the sky\nand the use of novel statistical methods.\n  The first part of this thesis describes the implementation of a novel\nstatistical technique which leverages the \"clumpiness\" of photons originating\nfrom point sources (PSs) to derive the properties of PS populations hidden in\nastrophysical datasets. This is applied to data from the Fermi satellite at\nhigh latitudes ($|b| > 30$\\deg) to characterize the contribution of PSs of\nextragalactic origin.

Machine Learning models once deployed, show\nnon-trivial accuracy and calibration degradation over time due to model\nstaleness. It is therefore necessary to regularly update models, and do so\nautomatically. This paper presents two paradigms of Batch Online Learning, one\nwhich incrementally updates the model parameters via an early stopping\nmechanism, and another which does so through a proximal regularization. We\nargue how both these schemes naturally trade-off between old and new data. We\nthen theoretically and empirically show that these two seemingly different\nschemes are closely related. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the\nutility of of our OL framework; how the two OL schemes relate to each other and\nhow they trade-off between the new and historical data. We then compare batch\nOL to full model retrains, and show how online learning is more robust to data\nissues. We also demonstrate the long term impact of Online Learning, the role\nof the initial Models in OL, the impact of delays in the update, and finally\nconclude with some implementation details and challenges in deploying a real\nworld online learning system in production.

How to detect fraudsters in time is a challenging problem. Most of\nthe existing approaches adopt classifiers to predict fraudsters given their\nactivity sequences along time. The main drawback of classification models is\nthat the prediction results between consecutive timestamps are often\ninconsistent. In this paper, we propose a survival analysis based fraud early\ndetection model, SAFE, which maps dynamic user activities to survival\nprobabilities that are guaranteed to be monotonically decreasing along time.\nSAFE adopts recurrent neural network (RNN) to handle user activity sequences\nand directly outputs hazard values at each timestamp, and then, survival\nprobability derived from hazard values is deployed to achieve consistent\npredictions. Because we only observe the user suspended time instead of the\nfraudulent activity time in the training data, we revise the loss function of\nthe regular survival model to achieve fraud early detection.

Metadata can be enriched to\ncalculate the existence of a connection between different disintegrated\ndatasets. In order to do so, the very first task is to attain a generic\nmetadata representation for domains. This representation narrows down the\nmetadata search space. The metadata search space consists of attributes, tags,\nsemantic content, annotations etc. to perform classification. The existing\ntechnologies limit the metadata bandwidth i.e. the operation set for matching\npurposes is restricted or limited. This research focuses on generating a mapper\nfunction called cognate that can find mathematical relevance based on pairs of\nattributes between disintegrated datasets. Each pair is designed from one of\nthe datasets under consideration using the existing metadata and available\nmeta-tags. After pairs have been generated, samples are constructed using a\ndifferent combination of pairs. The similarity and relevance between two or\nmore pairs are attained by using a data clustering technique to generate large\ngroups from smaller groups based on similarity index. The search space is\ndivided using a domain divider function and smaller search spaces are created\nusing relativity and tagging as the main concept.

Another advantage when\nrobots are involved, is that the amount of time a robot is occupied learning a\ntask---rather than being productive---can be reduced by transferring the\nlearned task to the real robot. Transfer learning requires some amount of\nfine-tuning on the real robot. For tasks which involve complex (non-linear)\ndynamics, the fine-tuning itself may take a substantial amount of time. In\norder to reduce the amount of fine-tuning we propose to learn robustified\ncontrollers in simulation.

Using Non-Equilibrium Green's Function and Non-Equilibrium Molecular\nDynamics simulations, we show that an exponentially mass-graded junction with a\nfinite thickness can result in 68\\% of enhancement in thermal conductance\nlarger compared to a single bridging layer (29\\%) and a linear mass-graded\njunction (64\\%) of similar thickness. We examine how the thermal conductance at\nsuch interfaces is influenced by geometric qualities and strength of\nanharmonicity. For geometric properties, we tested the effects from number of\nlayers and the junction thickness. In the absence of anharmonicity, increasing\nthe number of layers results in better elastic phonon transmission at each\nindividual boundary, countered by the decrease of available conducting\nchannels. Consequently, in the harmonic regime, conductance initially increases\nwith number of layers due to better bridging, but quickly saturates. The\npresence of slight anharmonic effects (at ultra-low temperature T = 2 K) turns\nthe saturation into a monotonically increasing trend. Anharmonic effects can\nfacilitate interfacial thermal transport through the thermalization of phonons.\nAt high temperature, however, the role of anharmonicity as a facilitator of\ninterfacial thermal transport reverses. Strong anharmonicity introduces\nsignificant intrinsic resistance, overruling the enhancement in thermal\nconduction at the boundaries. Our analysis shows that in our model\nLennard-Jones system, the influence of a mass-graded junction on thermal\nconductance is dominated by the phonon thermalization through anharmonic\neffects, while elastic phonon transmission plays a secondary role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 02:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}

Nanostructuring\noffers a very powerful tool to address both requirements: in nanostructured\nmaterials, boundaries preferentially scatter phonons compared to electrons. The\nsearch for low-thermal-conductivity nanostructures is typically limited to\nmaterials with simple crystal structures, such as silicon, because of the\ncomplexity arising from modeling branch- and wave vector- dependent nanoscale\nheat transport. Using the phonon mean-free-path (MFP) dependent Boltzmann\ntransport equation, a model that overcomes this limitation, we compute thermal\ntransport in 75 nanoporous half-Heusler compounds for different pore sizes. We\ndemonstrate that the optimization of thermal transport in nanostructures should\ntake into account both bulk thermal properties and geometry-dependent phonon\nsuppression, two aspects that are typically engineered separately. In fact, our\nwork predicts that, given a set of bulk materials and a system geometry, the\nordering of the thermal conductivity of the nanostructure does not necessarily\nalign with that of the bulk: We show that what dictates thermal transport is\nthe interplay between the bulk MFP distribution and the nanostructuring length\nscale of the material. Finally, we derive a thermal transport model that\nenables fast systems screening within large bulk material repositories and a\ngiven geometry. Our study motivates the need for a holistic approach to\nengineering thermal transport and provides a method for high-throughput\nmaterials discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 02:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}

Its optically-thin, high-frequency component, above the\nspectral peak, is often used for diagnostics of the nonthermal electrons and\nthe magnetic field in the radio source. Under favorable conditions, its\nlow-frequency counterpart brings additional, complementary information about\nthese parameters as well as thermal plasma diagnostics, either through\ngyrosynchrotron self-absorption, free-free absorption by the thermal plasma, or\nthe suppression of emission through the so-called Razin effect. However, their\neffects on the low-frequency spectrum are often masked by spatial\nnonuniformity. To disentangle the various contributions to low-frequency\ngyrosynchrotron emission, a combination of spectral and imaging data is needed.\nTo this end, we have investigated Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA)\nmulti-frequency images for 26 solar bursts observed jointly with Reuven Ramaty\nHigh Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) during the first half of 2002.\nFor each, we examined dynamic spectra, time- and frequency-synthesis maps,\nRHESSI images with overlaid OVSA contours, and a few representative\nsingle-frequency snapshot OVSA images.

It is found that at the interface of iron and MgO film, about two\nmonolayers of Fe3O4 is formed. Fe3O4 being the oxide of iron with the highest\nheat of formation, the reaction appears to be controlled thermodynamically. On\nthe other hand, on the interface with MgO (001) surface, FeO is formed,\nsuggesting that the reaction is limited by the availability of oxygen atoms.\nMagnetic behaviour of the FeO layer gets modified significantly due to\nproximity effect of the bulk ferromagnetic iron layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 05:16:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 11:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

These gravitational fluctuations travel at\nthe speed of light meaning they will arrive at a remote location significantly\nearlier than the fastest seismic waves. If these gravitational signals are\nmeasured by a gravimeter then early warning can be provided for an imminent\nearthquake. Earlier detection of earthquakes could be used to protect crucial\ninfrastructure and save lives. The Torsion Pendulum Dual Oscillator (TorPeDO)\nis a gravity gradient sensor that has been constructed at the Australian\nNational University. In this article we investigate the feasibility of\nmeasuring prompt gravitational transients from earthquakes with the TorPeDO. We\nsimulated the response of the sensor to these signals and inserted these\nresponses into scaled TorPeDO strain data to test their detection using a\nmatched filter search. This simulation allows us to estimate the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and detection time of the sensor to these transient\nsignals, along with the influence of different detection thresholds on range\nand detection time. This article also proposes a method of earthquake\nlocalisation using TorPeDO sensors without the need for accurate signal timing.\nA real-time estimate of earthquake magnitude can be produced by combining this\ncalculated location with TorPeDO strain data. We find that a TorPeDO system\noperating at design sensitivity would measure a moment magnitude 7.1\nearthquake, 200~km away, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 at 15.7~s after\nthe event starts. This will provide roughly 50.96~s of warning before the\narrival of the first S waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 05:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}

The issue is that the spectrum of $A$ might be\ncontaminated by non-informational top eigenvalues, e.g., due to scale`\nvariations in the data, and the application of $\\psi$ aims to remove these.\n  Designing a good functional $\\psi$ (and establishing what good means) is\noften challenging and model dependent. This paper proposes a simple and generic\nconstruction for sparse graphs, $$\\psi(A) = \\1((I+A)^r \\ge1),$$ where $A$\ndenotes the adjacency matrix and $r$ is an integer (less than the graph\ndiameter). This produces a graph connecting vertices from the original graph\nthat are within distance $r$, and is referred to as graph powering. It is shown\nthat graph powering regularizes the graph and decontaminates its spectrum in\nthe following sense: (i) If the graph is drawn from the sparse\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi ensemble, which has no spectral gap, it is shown that graph\npowering produces a `maximal' spectral gap, with the latter justified by\nestablishing an Alon-Boppana result for powered graphs; (ii) If the graph is\ndrawn from the sparse SBM, graph powering is shown to achieve the fundamental\nlimit for weak recovery (the KS threshold) similarly to \\cite{massoulie-STOC},\nsettling an open problem therein. Further, graph powering is shown to be\nsignificantly more robust to tangles and cliques than previous spectral\nalgorithms based on self-avoiding or nonbacktracking walk counts\n\\cite{massoulie-STOC,Mossel_SBM2,bordenave,colin3}.

As higher order independencies are tested in deeper recursive\ncalls, they benefit from more bootstrap samples, and therefore more resistant\nto the curse-of-dimensionality.

A\ntheoretical framework is presented to study the decay of dispersive motions in\nthe outer layer. To this end, the problem is formulated in Fourier space, and a\nset of governing ordinary differential equations per mode in wavenumber space\nis derived by linearizing the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations around\na constant background velocity.

The uniform circular array (UCA) is a simple antenna\nstructure for high spectrum efficiency radio vortex wireless communications.\nHowever, the OAM based electromagnetic waves are vortically hollow and\ndivergent, which may result in the signal loss. Moreover, the divergence of\ncorresponding OAM based electromagnetic wave increases as the order of OAM-mode\nand radius of UCA increases. Therefore, it is difficult to use high-order\nOAM-mode, because the corresponding received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is\nvery small. To overcome the difficulty of high-order OAM modes transmission, in\nthis paper we propose a lens antenna based electromagnetic waves converging\nscheme, which maintains the angular identification of multiple OAM-modes for\nradio vortex wireless communications. We further develop a bifocal lens antenna\nto not only converge the electromagnetic wave, but also compensate the SNR loss\non traditional electromagnetic waves.

The peak epoch of galaxy assembly (1<z<3) has been poorly\nexplored so far, and current observations in this redshift range are mostly\nlimited to targets with high chances to be in an outflowing phase. This paper\nintroduces SUPER (a SINFONI Survey for Unveiling the Physics and Effect of\nRadiative feedback), an ongoing ESO's VLT/SINFONI Large Programme. SUPER will\nperform the first systematic investigation of ionized outflows in a sizeable\nand blindly-selected sample of 39 X-ray AGN at z~2, which reaches high spatial\nresolutions (~2 kpc) thanks to the adaptive optics-assisted IFU observations.\nThe outflow morphology and star formation in the host galaxy will be mapped\nthrough the broad component of [OIII] and the narrow component of Ha emission\nlines. The main aim of our survey is to infer the impact of outflows on the\non-going star formation and to link the outflow properties to a number of AGN\nand host galaxy properties. We describe here the survey characteristics and\ngoals, as well as the selection of the target sample. Moreover, we present a\nfull characterization of its multi-wavelength properties: we measure, via\nspectral energy distribution fitting of UV-to-FIR photometry, stellar masses\n(4x10^9-2x10^11 Msun), star formation rates (25-680 Msun yr^-1) and AGN\nbolometric luminosities (2x10^44-8x10^47 erg s^-1), along with obscuring column\ndensities (<2x10^24 cm^-2) and 2-10 keV luminosities (2x10^43-6x10^45 erg s^-1)\nderived through X-ray spectral analysis. Finally, we classify our AGN as jetted\nor non-jetted according to their radio and FIR emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 09:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Such challenges include the limited linear\ndynamic range (LDR) of graphene-based photodetectors, the lack of efficient\ngeneration and extraction of photoexcited charges, the smearing of photoactive\njunctions due to hot-carriers effects, large-scale fabrication and ultimately\nthe environmental stability of the constituent materials.

A new class of graphene-based devices has emerged\nwhere chemical functionalisation, hybridisation with light-sensitising\nmaterials and the formation of heterostructures with other 2D materials have\nled to improved performance, stability or versatility. For example,\nintercalation of graphene with FeCl$_3$ is highly stable in ambient conditions\nand can be used to define photo-active junctions characterized by an\nunprecedented LDR while graphene oxide (GO) is a very scalable and versatile\nmaterial which supports the photodetection from UV to THz frequencies.\nNanoparticles and quantum dots have been used to enhance the absorption of\npristine graphene and to enable high gain thanks to the photogating effect.

The fabricated deformable microchannels of\nseveral microns in height and few millimeters in width, whose aspect ratio is\nabout two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the previous reports, allow\nus to investigate the fluid flow characteristics spanning a variety of distinct\nregimes from small wall deflections, where the deformable microchannel\nresembles its corresponding rigid one, to wall deflections much larger than the\noriginal height, where the height-independent characteristic behavior emerges.\nThe effects of the microchannel geometry, membrane properties, and pressure\ndifference across the channel are represented by a lumped variable called\nflexibility parameter. Under the same pressure drop across different channels,\nany difference in their geometries is reflected into the flexibility parameter\nof the channels, which can potentially cause the devices to operate under\ndistinct regimes of the fluid-solid characteristics.

The\ndynamical activity pattern that results from these interactions depends on the\nstrength of synaptic coupling between them. Importantly, the overall dynamics\nof a brain region in the absence of external input, so called ongoing brain\nactivity, has been attributed to the dynamics of such interactions. In our\nstudy, two different network scenarios are considered: a system with one\ninhibitory and two excitatory sub-networks, and a network representation with\nthree inhibitory sub-networks. To study the effect of synaptic strength on the\nglobal dynamics of the network, two parameters for relative couplings between\nthese sub-networks are considered. For each case, a co-dimension two\nbifurcation analysis is performed and the results have been compared to\nlarge-scale network simulations. Our analysis shows that Generalized\nLotka-Volterra (GLV) equations, well-known in predator-prey studies, yield a\nmeaningful population-level description for the collective behavior of spiking\nneuronal interaction, which have a hierarchical structure. In particular, we\nobserved a striking equivalence between the bifurcation diagrams of spiking\nneuronal networks and their corresponding GLV equations.

The phase diagram, spontaneous\nmagnetization and electric polarization are exactly calculated and their\ndependencies are comprehensively investigated under a concurrent influence of\ntemperature and electric field. It is found that the electric field mostly\nstabilizes at zero temperature the spontaneous antiferromagnetic order with\nrespect to the ferromagnetic one. At finite temperatures the external electric\nfield gradually suppresses a spontaneous ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic)\norder emergent close to a quarter (half) filling. An enhanced magnetoelectric\nresponse is detectable in vicinity of a continuous phase transition at which\nthe spontaneous magnetization vanishes and the electric polarization displays a\nweak-type singularity.

Deep\nNeural Networks have recently been proposed to overcome this limitation by\nlearning to estimate object occupancy. These estimates are nevertheless subject\nto uncertainty, making the evaluation of their confidence an important issue\nfor these measures to be useful for autonomous navigation and mapping. In this\nwork we approach the problem from two sides. First we discuss uncertainty\nestimation in deep models, proposing a solution based on a fully convolutional\nneural network. The proposed architecture is not restricted by the assumption\nthat the uncertainty follows a Gaussian model, as in the case of many popular\nsolutions for deep model uncertainty estimation, such as Monte-Carlo Dropout.\nWe present results showing that uncertainty over obstacle distances is actually\nbetter modeled with a Laplace distribution. Then, we propose a novel approach\nto build maps based on Deep Neural Network uncertainty models. In particular,\nwe present an algorithm to build a map that includes information over obstacle\ndistance estimates while taking into account the level of uncertainty in each\nestimate. We show how the constructed map can be used to increase global\nnavigation safety by planning trajectories which avoid areas of high\nuncertainty, enabling higher autonomy for mobile robots in indoor settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 14:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 10:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

In this\npaper, we focus on the black-box attack setting where attackers have almost no\naccess to the underlying models. To conduct black-box attack, a popular\napproach aims to train a substitute model based on the information queried from\nthe target DNN. The substitute model can then be attacked using existing\nwhite-box attack approaches, and the generated adversarial examples will be\nused to attack the target DNN.

It provides visual and\nnumeric representations of the changes in real time, offering a high degree of\ncustomization, and can be used for simulating or reproducing speech variation\nscenarios. The replicated experiment presented in this paper along with the\nanalysis of the relationship between the human and non-human interlocutors lays\nthe groundwork for a spoken dialogue system with personalized speaking style,\nwhich we expect will improve the naturalness and efficiency of human-computer\ninteraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 13:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}

In this paper, we first\nformulate an optimization problem that captures the amount of coordination gain\nat the cost of node activation over networks. This problem is challenging to\nsolve in a distributed manner, since the target gain is a function of the\nlong-term time portion of the inter-coupled activations of two adjacent nodes,\nand thus a standard Lagrange duality theory is hard to apply to obtain a\ndistributed decomposition as in the standard Network Utility Maximization. In\nthis paper, we propose three simulation-based distributed algorithms, each\nhaving different update rules, all of which require only one-hop message\npassing and locally-observed information. The key idea for being\ndistributedness is due to a stochastic approximation method that runs a Markov\nchain simulation incompletely over time, but provably guarantees its\nconvergence to the optimal solution. Next, we provide a game-theoretic\nframework to interpret our proposed algorithms from a different perspective.

A recent lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon\nstrange quark form factor predicts that the strange quark distribution is more\ncentralized in coordinate space than the antistrange quark distribution, and\nthus the strange quark distribution is more spread out in light-front momentum\nspace. We show that the lattice prediction implies that the difference between\nthe strange and antistrange parton distribution functions, $s(x)-\\bar{s}(x)$,\nis negative at small-$x$ and positive at large-$x$. We also evaluate the\nstrange quark form factor and $s(x)-\\bar{s}(x)$ using a baryon-meson\nfluctuation model and a novel nonperturbative model based on light-front\nholographic QCD. This procedure leads to a Veneziano-like expression of the\nform factor, which depends exclusively on the twist of the hadron and the\nproperties of the Regge trajectory of the vector meson which couples to the\nquark current in the hadron. The holographic structure of the model allows us\nto introduce unambiguously quark masses in the form factors and quark\ndistributions preserving the hard scattering counting rule at large-$Q^2$ and\nthe inclusive counting rule at large-$x$.

Experiments on the well-known AID dataset demonstrate that the\nproposed SiftingGAN method can not only effectively improve the performance of\nthe scene classification baseline that is achieved without data augmentation,\nbut also significantly excels the comparison methods based on traditional\ngeometric/radiometric transformation operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:26:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 15:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 16:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Converting a nonlinear model to an\nLPV form is also non-trivial and requires systematic methods to automate the\nprocess.\n  Inspired by these challenges, a systematic LPV embedding approach starting\nfrom multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear fractional representations\nwith a nonlinear feedback block (NLFR) is proposed. This NLFR model class is\nembedded into the LPV model class by an automated factorization of the\n(possibly MIMO) static nonlinear block present in the model. As a result of the\nfactorization, an LPV-LFR or an LPV state-space model with affine dependency on\nthe scheduling is obtained.

To rigorously study self-tabilizing\nsolutions to this problem, the Finite Departure Problem (FDP) has been proposed\n[12]. In the FDP we are given a network of processes in an arbitrary state, and\nthe goal is to eventually arrive at (and stay in) a state in which all leaving\nprocesses irrevocably decided to leave the system while for all\nweakly-connected components in the initial overlay network, all staying\nprocesses in that component will still form a weakly connected component. In\nthe standard interconnection model, the FDP is known to be unsolvable by local\ncontrol protocols, so oracles have been investigated that allow the problem to\nbe solved [12]. To avoid the use of oracles, we introduce a new interconnection\nmodel based on relays. Despite the relay model appearing to be rather\nrestrictive, we show that it is universal, i.e., it is possible to transform\nany weakly-connected topology into any other weakly-connected topology, which\nis important for being a useful interconnection model for overlay networks.\nApart from this, our model allows processes to grant and revoke access rights,\nwhich is why we believe it to be of interest beyond the scope of this paper.

Theoretical work\nhas derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have\ntested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy.\nNevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect\nand noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how\nthis process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical\nstudy, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions\nwhere the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the\ncurrent patch and the overall environment. Evidence accumulation models belong\nto the class of drift diffusion processes and have been used to model decision\nmaking in different contexts. We solve the model for conditions where foraging\ndecisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform\nsimulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not\nmet. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can\nrepresent different strategies, for example an increment-decrement or counting\nstrategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but\ndiffer in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is\nuncertain. To account for sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an\nenergy-dependent utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch\nresidence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative\nconnection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence\naccumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical\nframework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits\nunderlying patch leaving decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 15:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Systems approaches integrate multi-omic information to\nfind pathways to disease endpoints and make optimal inference decisions.\nMethod: Here, we introduce a multi-stage approach to integrate causal networks\nin observational studies and GWAS to facilitate mechanistic understanding\nthrough identification of pathways from the genome to risk factors/disease via\nmetabolomics. The pathways in causal networks reveal the underlying\nrelationships behind observations, which do not play a significant role in more\ntraditional correlative analyses, where one variable at a time is considered.\nResults: We identified a causal network over the metabolomic level using the\ngenome directed acyclic graph (G-DAG), to systematically assess whether\nvariations in the genome lead to variations in triglyceride levels as a risk\nfactor of cardiovascular disease. We found LRRC46 and LRRC69 harboring\nloss-of-function mutations have significant effect on two metabolites with\ndirect effects on triglyceride levels.

Although the integration of SGX within\nthe cloud considerably strengthens the threat model for cloud applications, the\ncurrent model to deploy and provision enclaves prevents the cloud operator from\nadding or removing enclaves dynamically - thus preventing elasticity for\nTEE-based applications in the cloud.\n  In this paper, we propose ReplicaTEE, a solution that enables seamless\nprovisioning and decommissioning of TEE-based applications in the cloud.\nReplicaTEE leverages an SGX-based provisioning layer that interfaces with a\nByzantine Fault-Tolerant storage service to securely orchestrate enclave\nreplication in the cloud, without the active intervention of the application\nowner. Namely, in ReplicaTEE, the application owner entrusts application secret\nto the provisioning layer; the latter handles all enclave commissioning and\nde-commissioning operations throughout the application lifetime. We analyze the\nsecurity of ReplicaTEE and show that it is secure against attacks by a powerful\nadversary that can compromise a large fraction of the cloud infrastructure. We\nimplement a prototype of ReplicaTEE in a realistic cloud environment and\nevaluate its performance. ReplicaTEE moderately increments the TCB by ~800 LoC.\nOur evaluation shows that ReplicaTEE does not add significant overhead to\nexisting SGX-based applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 15:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}

In this paper, we\npresent our effort for the audio-video based sub-challenge of the Emotion\nRecognition in the Wild (EmotiW) 2018 challenge, which requires participants to\nassign a single emotion label to the video clip from the six universal emotions\n(Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sad and Surprise) and Neutral. The proposed\nmultimodal emotion recognition system takes audio, video and text information\ninto account. Except for handcraft features, we also extract bottleneck\nfeatures from deep neutral networks (DNNs) via transfer learning. Both temporal\nclassifiers and non-temporal classifiers are evaluated to obtain the best\nunimodal emotion classification result. Then possibilities are extracted and\npassed into the Beam Search Fusion (BS-Fusion). We test our method in the\nEmotiW 2018 challenge and we gain promising results. Compared with the baseline\nsystem, there is a significant improvement. We achieve 60.34% accuracy on the\ntesting dataset, which is only 1.5% lower than the winner. It shows that our\nmethod is very competitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 08:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

About 9.5 million high- school seniors participate in Gaokao\nevery year, and the Gaokao scores are good for just one year. A student has a\nstrong chance to be accepted if their Gaokao score is better than the admission\nscores of the universities they selected in their applications. However, the\nadmission scores of universities are unknown at the time when filling out\napplications, which to be determined dynamically during the admission process\nand may fluctuate from year to year. To increase their chances of acceptance to\na best- suited university, students need to predict admission score of each\nuniversity they are interested in. Early prediction methods are empirical\nwithout the backing of in-depth data studies. We fill this void by presenting\nwell-tested mathematical models based on the ranking of Gaokao scores in a PAR.\nWe show that our methods significantly outperform the methods commonly used by\nteachers and experts, and can predict admission scores with an accuracy of 91%\nwithin a 7-point margin in an exam of a 750-point grading scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 20:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

In the presence of data measured over time,\nBayesian time series models have been used to impute what would have happened\nafter the policy was initiated, had the policy not taken place, in order to\nestimate causal effects. However, the considerations regarding the definition\nof the target estimands, the underlying assumptions, the plausibility of such\nassumptions, and the choice of an appropriate model have not been thoroughly\ninvestigated. In this paper, we establish useful estimands for the evaluation\nof large-scale policies.

We illustrate an approach to evaluate\nthis key causal assumption and facilitate model elicitation based on data from\nthe time interval before policy initiation and using classic statistical\ntechniques. As an illustration, we study the Hospital Readmissions Reduction\nProgram (HRRP), a US federal intervention aiming to improve health outcomes for\npatients with pneumonia, acute myocardial infraction, or congestive failure\nadmitted to a hospital. We evaluate the effect of the HRRP on population\nmortality among the elderly across the US and in four geographic subregions,\nand at different time windows.
