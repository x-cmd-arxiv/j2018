Usually the ICA\nframework assumes a model according to which the observations are generated\n(such as a linear transformation with additive noise). ICA over finite fields\nis a special case of ICA in which both the observations and the independent\ncomponents are over a finite alphabet. In this thesis we consider a formulation\nof the finite-field case in which an observation vector is decomposed to its\nindependent components (as much as possible) with no prior assumption on the\nway it was generated. This generalization is also known as Barlow's minimal\nredundancy representation and is considered an open problem. We propose several\ntheorems and show that this hard problem can be accurately solved with a branch\nand bound search tree algorithm, or tightly approximated with a series of\nlinear problems. Moreover, we show that there exists a simple transformation\n(namely, order permutation) which provides a greedy yet very effective\napproximation of the optimal solution. We further show that while not every\nrandom vector can be efficiently decomposed into independent components, the\nvast majority of vectors do decompose very well (that is, within a small\nconstant cost), as the dimension increases. In addition, we show that we may\npractically achieve this favorable constant cost with a complexity that is\nasymptotically linear in the alphabet size.

The embedding into a spatio--temporal framework also allows for the\nmodelling of the dynamic site---selection process itself. Real--world factors\naffecting both the size and location of the network can be easily modelled and\nquantified. Depending upon the choice of population of locations to consider\nfor selection across space and time under the site--selection process,\ndifferent insights about the precise nature of preferential sampling can be\nobtained. The general framework developed in the paper is designed to be easily\nand quickly fit using the R-INLA package. We apply this framework to a case\nstudy involving particulate air pollution over the UK where a major reduction\nin the size of a monitoring network through time occurred. It is demonstrated\nthat a significant response--biased reduction in the air quality monitoring\nnetwork occurred. We also show that the network was consistently\nunrepresentative of the levels of particulate matter seen across much of GB\nthroughout the operating life of the network. Finally we show that this may\nhave led to a severe over-reporting of the population--average exposure levels\nexperienced across GB. This could have great impacts on estimates of the health\neffects of black smoke levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 16:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 01:20:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 00:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

This situation did not change much during the last\n40+ years.\n  It turns out that this common belief, i.e, Cwikel's approach yields bad\nconstants, is not set in stone: We give a drastic simplification of Cwikel's\noriginal approach which leads to an astonishingly good bound for the constant\nin the CLR inequality. Our proof is also quite flexible and leads to rather\nprecise bounds for a large class of Schr\\\"odinger-type operators with\ngeneralized kinetic energies. Moreover, it highlights a natural but overlooked\nconnection of the CLR bound with bounds for maximal Fourier multipliers from\nharmonic analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 17:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-14"}

Payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the Lightning\nNetwork have emerged as a viable scaling solution. However, completing payments\non PCNs is challenging: payments must be routed on paths with sufficient funds.\nAs payments flow over a single channel (link) in the same direction, the\nchannel eventually becomes depleted and cannot support further payments in that\ndirection; hence, naive routing schemes like shortest-path routing can deplete\nkey payment channels and paralyze the system. Today's PCNs also route payments\natomically, worsening the problem. In this paper, we present Spider, a routing\nsolution that \"packetizes\" transactions and uses a multi-path transport\nprotocol to achieve high-throughput routing in PCNs. Packetization allows\nSpider to complete even large transactions on low-capacity payment channels\nover time, while the multi-path congestion control protocol ensures balanced\nutilization of channels and fairness across flows. Extensive simulations\ncomparing Spider with state-of-the-art approaches shows that Spider requires\nless than 25% of the funds to successfully route over 95% of transactions on\nbalanced traffic demands, and offloads 4x more transactions onto the PCN on\nimbalanced demands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 17:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 14:07:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 15:23:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 15:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Here we continue with such a unifying\napproach, begun in arxiv:1809.00556, whose key ingredient is a symmetry\nprinciple, which enforces physics to be relational. Thanks to gauge related\nredundancies, this leads to a perspective-neutral structure which contains all\nframe choices at once and via which frame perspectives can be consistently\nswitched. Formulated in the language of constrained systems, the\nperspective-neutral structure is the constraint surface classically and the\ngauge invariant Hilbert space in the Dirac quantized theory. By contrast, a\nperspective relative to a specific frame corresponds to a gauge choice and the\nassociated reduced phase and Hilbert space. QRF changes thus amount to a gauge\ntransformation. We show that they take the form of `quantum coordinate\nchanges'. We illustrate this in a general mechanical model, namely the\nrelational $N$-body problem in 3D space with rotational and translational\nsymmetry. This model is especially interesting because it features the Gribov\nproblem so that globally valid gauge fixing conditions, and hence relational\nframe perspectives, are absent. The constraint surface is topologically\nnon-trivial and foliated by 3-, 5- and 6-dimensional gauge orbits, where the\nlower dimensional orbits are a set of measure zero. The $N$-body problem also\ndoes not admit globally valid canonically conjugate pairs of Dirac observables.\nThese challenges notwithstanding, we exhibit how one can construct the QRF\ntransformations for the 3-body problem.

Other techniques\nsuch as the Flicker can also be used to determine stellar surface gravities,\nbut only works for $\\log{g}$ above $2.5$ dex. In this work, we present a new\nmetric called FliPer (the acronym stands for Flicker in spectral power density,\nin opposition to the standard Flicker measurement which is computed in the time\ndomain that is able to extend the range for which reliable surface gravities\ncan be obtained ($0.1<\\log{g}<4.6$ dex) without performing any seismic analysis\nfor stars brighter than $\\textit{Kp}$ $<$ 14. FliPer takes into account the\naverage variability of a star measured in the power density spectrum in a given\nrange of frequencies. However, FliPer values calculated on several ranges of\nfrequency are required to better characterize a star. Using a large set of\nasteroseismic targets it is possible to calibrate the behavior of surface\ngravity with FliPer through machine learning. This calibration made with a\nrandom forest regressor covers a wide range of surface gravities from\nmain-sequence stars to subgiants and red giants, with very small uncertainties\nfrom $0.04$ to $0.1$ dex. FliPer values can be inserted in automatic global\nseismic pipelines to either give an estimation of the stellar surface gravity\nor to assess the quality of the seismic results by detecting any outliers in\nthe obtained $\\nu_{max}$ values. FliPer also constrain the surface gravities of\nmain-sequence dwarfs using only long cadence data for which the Nyquist\nfrequency is too low to measure the acoustic-mode properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

The Gaia ESA mission will estimate the astrometric and physical data\nof more than one billion objects, providing the largest and most precise\ncatalog of absolute astrometry in the history of Astronomy. The core of this\nprocess, the so-called global sphere reconstruction, is represented by the\nreduction of a subset of these objects which will be used to define the\ncelestial reference frame. As the Hipparcos mission showed, and as is inherent\nto all kinds of absolute measurements, possible errors in the data reduction\ncan hardly be identified from the catalog, thus potentially introducing\nsystematic errors in all derived work. Aims. Following up on the lessons\nlearned from Hipparcos, our aim is thus to develop an independent sphere\nreconstruction method that contributes to guarantee the quality of the\nastrometric results without fully reproducing the main processing chain.\nMethods. Indeed, given the unfeasibility of a complete replica of the data\nreduction pipeline, an astrometric verification unit (AVU) was instituted by\nthe Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC). One of its jobs is to\nimplement and operate an independent global sphere reconstruction (GSR),\nparallel to the baseline one (AGIS, namely Astrometric Global Iterative\nSolution) but limited to the primary stars and for validation purposes, to\ncompare the two results, and to report on any significant differences.

Besides using dropout during training for\nthe best test accuracy, we propose to use dropout also at test time to achieve\nstrong defense effects.

The spin current\ngenerated by the spin Hall effect in a bottom nonmagnetic heavy metal excites a\nself-oscillation of the magnetization in an attached ferromagnet through\nspin-transfer effect. The spin current simultaneously creates spin accumulation\ninside the ferromagnet. Therefore, when the top surfaces of two ferromagnets\nare connected by a nonmagnetic material having a long spin diffusion length,\nanother spin current flows according to the gradient of the spin accumulations\nbetween the ferromagnets. This additional spin current excites an additional\nspin torque leading to a coupled motion of the magnetizations. This coupling\nmechanism comes purely from spin degree of freedom in the system without using\nelectric and/or magnetic interactions. The additional spin torque acts as a\nrepulsive force between the magnetizations, and prefers an antiphase\nsynchronization between the oscillators. The phase difference in a synchronized\nstate is determined by the competition between this additional spin torque and\nspin pumping. Eventually, either an in-phase or antiphase synchronization is\nspontaneously excited in the individual ferromagnets, depending on the current\nmagnitude. These conclusions are obtained by deriving the theoretical formula\nof the additional spin torque from the diffusive spin transport theory and\nsolving the equation of motion of the magnetizations both numerically and\nanalytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 22:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

Such\nslowdowns provide lower bounds on worst-case execution time; an important\nmetric in systems with real-time constraints.\n  Our approach considers a set of parameterised \"enemy\" processes and \"victim\"\nprograms, each targeting a shared resource. The autotuner searches for enemy\nprocess parameters that are effective at causing slowdowns in the victim\nprograms. The idea is that victim programs behave as a proxy for shared\nresource usage of arbitrary programs. We evaluate our approach on: 5 different\nchips; 3 resources (cache, memory bus, and main memory); and consider several\nsearch strategies and slowdown metrics. Using enemy processes tuned per chip,\nwe evaluate the slowdowns on the autobench and coremark benchmark suites and\nshow that our method is able to achieve slowdowns in 98% of benchmark/chip\ncombinations and provide similar results to manually written enemy processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 22:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

Recent studies on object detection and feature extraction have\nbecome important for scene understanding and 3D mapping. However, 3D shape of\nthe object is too complex to formulate the probabilistic observation model;\ntherefore, performing the Bayesian inference of the object-oriented features as\nwell as their pose is less considered. Besides, when the robot equipped with an\nRGB mono camera only observes the projected single view of an object, a\nsignificant amount of the 3D shape information is abandoned. Due to these\nlimitations, semantic SLAM and viewpoint-independent loop closure using\nvolumetric 3D object shape is challenging. In order to enable the complete\nformulation of probabilistic semantic SLAM, we approximate the observation\nmodel of a 3D object with a tractable distribution.

We simulate a scenario of a market\nwith $S$ suppliers and $C$ consumers such that at every instant, each supplier\nagent supplies a certain quantity and simultaneously, each consumer agent\nconsumes a certain quantity. The information about the total amount supplied\nand consumed is only kept with the center.

This leads to a nonhomogeneous Markov chain and we show\nalmost sure convergence of this chain to the social optimum, for our market of\ndistributed supplier and consumer agents. Employing this AIMD-type algorithm,\nthe center sends a feedback message to the agents in the supplier side if there\nis a scenario of excess supply, or to the consumer agents if there is excess\nconsumption. Each agent has a concave utility function whose derivative tends\nto 0 when an optimum quantity is supplied/consumed. Hence when social\nconvergence is reached, each agent supplies or consumes a quantity which leads\nto its individual maximum profit, without the need of any communication.

A number of kernel approximation\nmethods have thus been proposed in the recent years, among which the random\nfeatures method gains much popularity due to its simplicity and direct\nreduction of nonlinear problem to a linear one. The Random Binning (RB)\nfeature, proposed in the first random-feature paper \\cite{rahimi2007random},\nhas drawn much less attention than the Random Fourier (RF) feature.

A wide\nrange of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods now exists. It is of\ngreat interest to guarantee that the performance of an ADP scheme be at least\nsome known fraction, say $\\beta$, of optimal. This paper introduces a general\napproach to bounding the performance of ADP methods, in this sense, in the\nstochastic setting. The approach is based on new results for bounding greedy\nsolutions in string optimization problems, where one has to choose a string\n(ordered set) of actions to maximize an objective function. This bounding\ntechnique is inspired by submodularity theory, but submodularity is not\nrequired for establishing bounds. Instead, the bounding is based on quantifying\ncertain notions of curvature of string functions; the smaller the curvatures\nthe better the bound.

This is especially true of news stories shared on social media since\nthey don't undergo any stringent journalistic checking associated with main\nstream media. Given the inherent human tendency to share information with their\nsocial connections at a mouse-click, fake news articles masquerading as real\nones, tend to spread widely and virally. The presence of echo chambers (people\nsharing same beliefs) in social networks, only adds to this problem of\nwide-spread existence of fake news on social media. In this paper, we tackle\nthe problem of fake news detection from social media by exploiting the very\npresence of echo chambers that exist within the social network of users to\nobtain an efficient and informative latent representation of the news article.\nBy modeling the echo-chambers as closely-connected communities within the\nsocial network, we represent a news article as a 3-mode tensor of the structure\n- <News, User, Community> and propose a tensor factorization based method to\nencode the news article in a latent embedding space preserving the community\nstructure.

However, if these bodies release energy in the atmosphere instead of at\nthe surface, this assumption might not be justified. Our aim is to explore the\ninteractions of infalling planetesimals with primordial atmospheres at an\nembedded phase of evolution. We investigate effects of atmospheric interaction\non the planetesimals (mass loss) and the atmosphere (heating/cooling). We used\natmospheric parameters from a snapshot of time-dependent evolution simulations\nfor embedded atmospheres and simulated purely radial, infall events of\nsiliceous planetesimals in a 1D, explicit code. We implemented energy transfer\nbetween friction, radiation transfer by the atmosphere and the body and thermal\nablation; this gives us the possibility to examine the effects on the\nplanetesimals and the atmosphere. We find that a significant amount of\ngravitational energy is indeed dissipated into the atmosphere, especially for\nlarger planetary cores, which consequently cannot contribute to the atmospheric\nplanetary luminosity. Furthermore, we examine that planetesimal infall events\nfor cores, $M_\\mathrm{C} > 2$M$_{\\oplus}$, which actually result in a local\ncooling of the atmosphere; this is totally in contradiction with the classical\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 08:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Methods: An ACR phantom\nwas examined at different radiation dose levels. To characterize the image\ntexture, two Haralick texture parameters, contrast and entropy, for different\ndose level and reconstruction algorithms were assessed. The visual impression\nof images and their structural differences were evaluated using the structural\nsimilarity index (SSIM). Noise was determined for all dose and AMIRE levels and\ncompared to those by filtered back projection (FBP). The spatial resolution was\ndetermined by the modulation transfer functions and the line spread function.\nResults: The Haralick texture parameters decreased with increasing ADMIRE\nlevels I up to V.

In order to\nreap the benefits of flexible networking, we propose a spatial network\nconfiguration scheme (SNC), which can result in efficient networking; both from\nthe perspective of network capacity, and profitability. First, SNC utilizes the\ndrone-base-stations (drone-BSs) to configure access points. Drone-BSs are\nshifting paradigms of heterogeneous wireless networks by providing radically\nflexible deployment opportunities. On the other hand, their limited endurance\nand potential high cost increase the importance of utilizing drone-BSs\nefficiently. Therefore, secondly, user mobility is exploited via\nuser-in-the-loop (UIL), which aims at influencing users' mobility by offering\nincentives. The proposed uncoordinated SNC is a computationally efficient\nmethod, yet, it may be insufficient to exploit the synergy between drone-BSs\nand UIL. Hence, we propose joint SNC, which increases the performance gain\nalong with the computational cost. Finally, semi-joint SNC combines benefits of\njoint SNC, with computational efficiency. Numerical results show that\nsemi-joint SNC is two orders of magnitude times faster than joint SNC, and more\nthan 15 percent profit can be obtained compared to conventional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 09:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

A-MIMO-RoC, by leveraging a fully analog\nimplementation, completely avoids any dedicated digital interface by using a\ntransparent end-to-end system, with consequent latency, bandwidth and cost\nbenefits. Usually, LAN cables are exploited mainly in the low-frequency\nspectrum portion, mostly due to the moderate cable attenuation and crosstalk\namong twisted-pairs. Unlike current systems based on LAN cables, the key\nfeature of the proposed platform is to exploit more efficiently the huge\nbandwidth capability offered by LAN cables, that contain 4 twisted-pairs\nreaching up to 500 MHz bandwidth/pair when the length is below 100 m. Several\nworks proposed numerical simulations that assert the feasibility of employing\nLAN cables for indoor FH applications up to several hundreds of MHz, but an\nA-MIMO-RoC experimental evaluation is still missing. Here, we present some\npreliminary results obtained with an A-MIMO-RoC prototype made by low-cost\nall-analog/all-passive devices along the signal path.

In this framework, Jupiter reached ~20 Earth masses within\n~1 Myr and slowly grew to ~50 Earth masses in the subsequent 2 Myr before\nreaching its present-day mass. The evidence that Jupiter slowed down its growth\nafter reaching 20 Earth masses for at least 2 Myr is puzzling because a planet\nof this mass is expected to trigger fast runaway gas accretion. Here, we use\ntheoretical models to describe the conditions allowing for such a slow\naccretion and show that Jupiter grew in three distinct phases. First, rapid\npebble accretion brought the major part of Jupiter's core mass. Second, slow\nplanetesimal accretion provided the energy required to hinder runaway gas\naccretion during 2 Myr. Third, runaway gas accretion proceeded. Both pebbles\nand planetesimals therefore have an important role in Jupiter's formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 12:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

We present a global sensitivity analysis of a new\nsub-model for turbulence and fire-spotting included in a wildfire spread model\nbased on a stochastic representation of the fireline. To limit the number of\nmodel evaluations, fast surrogate models based on generalized Polynomial Chaos\n(gPC) and Gaussian Process are used to identify the key parameters affecting\ntopology and size of burnt area. This study investigates the application of\nthese surrogates to compute Sobol' sensitivity indices in an idealized test\ncase. The wind is known to drive the fire propagation. The results show that it\nis a more general leading factor that governs the generation of secondary\nfires. This study also compares the performance of the surrogates for varying\nsize and type of training sets as well as for varying parameterization and\nchoice of algorithms. The best performance was achieved using a gPC strategy\nbased on a sparse least-angle regression (LAR) and a low-discrepancy Halton's\nsequence. Still, the LAR-based gPC surrogate tends to filter out the\ninformation coming from parameters with large length-scale, which is not the\ncase of the cleaning-based gPC surrogate. For both algorithms, sparsity ensures\na surrogate can be built using an affordable number of forward model\nevaluations, while the model response is highly multi-scale and nonlinear.\nUsing a sparse surrogate is thus a promising strategy to analyze new models and\nits dependency on input parameters in wildfire applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 14:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

The proposed model confirms the gating charge transfer\nhypothesis, with the movement of the S4 segment among 5 different stable\npositions where the gating charges differently interact with the negatively\ncharged residues on the channel protein. This behavior results in macroscopic\ngating currents displaying properties quite similar to those experimentally\nfound, including a very fast component followed by a slower one with an evident\nrising phase at high depolarizing voltages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 15:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The increased popularity\nof DL applications deployed on a wide-spectrum of platforms have resulted in a\nplethora of design challenges related to the constraints introduced by the\nhardware itself. What is the latency or energy cost for an inference made by a\nDeep Neural Network (DNN)? Is it possible to predict this latency or energy\nconsumption before a model is trained? If yes, how can machine learners take\nadvantage of these models to design the hardware-optimal DNN for deployment?\nFrom lengthening battery life of mobile devices to reducing the runtime\nrequirements of DL models executing in the cloud, the answers to these\nquestions have drawn significant attention.\n  One cannot optimize what isn't properly modeled. Therefore, it is important\nto understand the hardware efficiency of DL models during serving for making an\ninference, before even training the model. This key observation has motivated\nthe use of predictive models to capture the hardware performance or energy\nefficiency of DL applications. Furthermore, DL practitioners are challenged\nwith the task of designing the DNN model, i.e., of tuning the hyper-parameters\nof the DNN architecture, while optimizing for both accuracy of the DL model and\nits hardware efficiency. Therefore, state-of-the-art methodologies have\nproposed hardware-aware hyper-parameter optimization techniques. In this paper,\nwe provide a comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art work and selected\nresults on the hardware-aware modeling and optimization for DL applications. We\nalso highlight several open questions that are poised to give rise to novel\nhardware-aware designs in the next few years, as DL applications continue to\nsignificantly impact associated hardware systems and platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 15:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

Physicians use\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to take images of the heart in order to\nnon-invasively estimate its structural and functional parameters for\ncardiovascular diagnosis and disease management. The end-systolic volume (ESV)\nand end-diastolic volume (EDV) of the left ventricle (LV), and the ejection\nfraction (EF) are indicators of heart disease. These measures can be derived\nfrom the segmented contours of the LV; thus, consistent and accurate\nsegmentation of the LV from MRI images are critical to the accuracy of the ESV,\nEDV, and EF, and to non-invasive cardiac disease detection.\n  In this work, various image preprocessing techniques, model configurations\nusing the U-Net deep learning architecture, postprocessing methods, and\napproaches for volume estimation are investigated. An end-to-end analytics\npipeline with multiple stages is provided for automated LV segmentation and\nvolume estimation. First, image data are reformatted and processed from DICOM\nand NIfTI formats to raw images in array format. Secondly, raw images are\nprocessed with multiple image preprocessing methods and cropped to include only\nthe Region of Interest (ROI). Thirdly, preprocessed images are segmented using\nU-Net models. Lastly, post processing of segmented images to remove extra\ncontours along with intelligent slice and frame selection are applied, followed\nby calculation of the ESV, EDV, and EF. This analytics pipeline is implemented\nand runs on a distributed computing environment with a GPU cluster at the San\nDiego Supercomputer Center at UCSD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 06:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 16:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

The solar cells comprise a window, designed to reduce the\nreflection of incident light, Schottky-barrier and ohmic front electrodes, an\nn-doped InGaN wafer, and a metallic periodically corrugated back-reflector\n(PCBR). The ratio of indium to gallium in the wafer varies periodically\nthroughout the thickness of the absorbing layer of the solar cell. Thus, the\nresulting InGaN wafer's optical and electrical properties are made to vary\nperiodically. This material nonhomogeneity could be physically achieved by\nvarying the fractional composition of indium and gallium during deposition.\nEmpirical models for indium nitride and gallium nitride were combined using\nVegard's law to determine the optical and electrical constitutive properties of\nthe alloy. The nonhomogeneity of the electrical properties of the InGaN aids in\nthe separation of the excited electron-hole pairs, while the periodicities of\noptical properties and the back-reflector enable the incident light to couple\nto multiple guided wave modes. The profile of the resulting\ncharge-carrier-generation rate when the solar cell is illuminated by the AM1.5G\nspectrum was calculated using the rigorous coupled-wave approach. The\nsteady-state drift-diffusion equations were solved using COMSOL, which employs\nfinite-volume methods, to calculate the current density as a function of the\nvoltage. Mid-band Shockley-Read-Hall, Auger, and radiative recombination rates\nwere taken to be the dominant methods of recombination. The model was used to\nstudy the effects of the solar-cell geometry and the shape of the periodic\nmaterial nonhomogeneity on efficiency.

It is based on the correlation of a series of images\ncaptured during a mechanical experiment, that are matched by displacement\nfields derived from an underlying mechanical model. In recent studies, it has\nbeen shown that when the applied boundary conditions lie outside the employed\nfield of view, IDIC suffers from inaccuracies. A typical example is a\nmicromechanical parameter identification inside a Microstructural Volume\nElement (MVE), whereby images are usually obtained by electron microscopy or\nother microscopy techniques but the loads are applied at a much larger scale.\nFor any IDIC model, MVE boundary conditions still need to be specified, and any\ndeviation or fluctuation in these boundary conditions may significantly\ninfluence the quality of identification. Prescribing proper boundary conditions\nis generally a challenging task, because the MVE has no free boundary, and the\nboundary displacements are typically highly heterogeneous due to the underlying\nmicrostructure. The aim of this paper is therefore first to quantify the\neffects of errors in the prescribed boundary conditions on the accuracy of the\nidentification in a systematic way. To this end, three kinds of mechanical\ntests, each for various levels of material contrast ratios and levels of image\nnoise, are carried out by means of virtual experiments. For simplicity, an\nelastic compressible Neo-Hookean constitutive model under plane strain\nassumption is adopted. It is shown that a high level of detail is required in\nthe applied boundary conditions. This motivates an improved boundary condition\napplication approach, which considers constitutive material parameters as well\nas kinematic variables at the boundary of the entire MVE as degrees of freedom\nin...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 15:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}
