In instances of low\nphase coverage such as with stellar orbits in the Galactic center or with\ndirectly-imaged exoplanets, data have low constraining power and thus priors\ncan bias parameter estimates and produce under-estimated confidence intervals.\nUniform priors, which are commonly assumed in orbit fitting, are notorious for\nthis. We propose a new observable-based prior paradigm that is based on\nuniformity in observables. We compare performance of this observable-based\nprior and of commonly assumed uniform priors using Galactic center and\ndirectly-imaged exoplanet (HR 8799) data. The observable-based prior can reduce\nbiases in model parameters by a factor of two and helps avoid under-estimation\nof confidence intervals for simulations with less than about 40% phase\ncoverage. Above this threshold, orbital solutions for objects with sufficient\nphase coverage such as S0-2, a short-period star at the Galactic center with\nfull phase coverage, are consistent with previously published results. Below\nthis threshold, the observable-based prior limits prior influence in regions of\nprior dominance and increases data influence. Using the observable-based prior,\nHR 8799 orbital analyses favor lower eccentricity orbits and provide stronger\nevidence that the four planets have a consistent inclination around 30 degrees\nto within 1-sigma. This analysis also allows for the possibility of\ncoplanarity.

Due\nto different tracking implementations and hardware constraints, developing AR\napplications either requires low-level programming skills, or is done through\nspecific authoring tools that largely sacrifice the possibility of customizing\nthe AR experience. Existing development workflows also do not support\npreviewing or simulating the AR experience, requiring a lengthy process of\ntrial and error by which content creators deploy and physically test\napplications in each iteration. To mitigate these limitations, we propose\nCAVE-AR, a novel virtual reality system for authoring, simulating and debugging\ncustom AR experiences. Available both as a standalone or a plug-in tool,\nCAVE-AR is based on the concept of representing in the same global reference\nsystem both in AR content and tracking information, mixing geographical\ninformation, architectural features, and sensor data to simulate the context of\nan AR experience. Thanks to its novel abstraction of existing tracking\ntechnologies, CAVE-AR operates independently of users' devices, and integrates\nwith existing programming tools to provide maximum flexibility. Our VR\napplication provides designers with ways to create and modify an AR\napplication, even while others are in the midst of using it. CAVE-AR further\nallows the designer to track how users are behaving, preview what they are\ncurrently seeing, and interact with them through several different channels. To\nillustrate our proposed development workflow and demonstrate the advantages of\nour authoring system, we introduce two CAVEAR use cases in which an augmented\nreality application is created and tested. We compare the CAVE-AR workflow to\ntraditional development methods and demonstrate the importance of simulation\nand live application debugging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 16:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 19:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

These components are typically approached separately: a machine\nlearning model is first trained via a measure of predictive accuracy, and then\nits predictions are used as input into an optimization algorithm which produces\na decision. However, the loss function used to train the model may easily be\nmisaligned with the end goal, which is to make the best decisions possible.\nHand-tuning the loss function to align with optimization is a difficult and\nerror-prone process (which is often skipped entirely).\n  We focus on combinatorial optimization problems and introduce a general\nframework for decision-focused learning, where the machine learning model is\ndirectly trained in conjunction with the optimization algorithm to produce\nhigh-quality decisions. Technically, our contribution is a means of integrating\ncommon classes of discrete optimization problems into deep learning or other\npredictive models, which are typically trained via gradient descent. The main\nidea is to use a continuous relaxation of the discrete problem to propagate\ngradients through the optimization procedure. We instantiate this framework for\ntwo broad classes of combinatorial problems: linear programs and submodular\nmaximization. Experimental results across a variety of domains show that\ndecision-focused learning often leads to improved optimization performance\ncompared to traditional methods. We find that standard measures of accuracy are\nnot a reliable proxy for a predictive model's utility in optimization, and our\nmethod's ability to specify the true goal as the model's training objective\nyields substantial dividends across a range of decision problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 17:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 00:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

Conversely, more recent models propose that a large fraction of hot\nJupiters could have formed via rapid gas accretion in their current orbital\nneighborhood. In this study, we examine the period-mass distribution of\nclose-in giant planets, and demonstrate that the inner boundary of this\npopulation conforms to the expectations of the in-situ formation scenario.\nSpecifically, we show that if conglomeration unfolds close to the disk's inner\nedge, the semi-major axis - mass relation of the emergent planets should follow\na power law $a \\propto M^{-2/7}$ - a trend clearly reflected in the data. We\nfurther discuss corrections to this relationship due to tidal decay of\nplanetary orbits.

One major hurdle to design high-bandwidth,\nhigh-precision, large-scale neural interfaces lies in the formidable data\nstreams that are generated by the recorder chip and need to be online\ntransferred to a remote computer. The data rates can require hundreds to\nthousands of I/O pads on the recorder chip and power consumption on the order\nof Watts for data streaming alone. We developed a deep learning-based\ncompression model to reduce the data rate of multichannel action potentials.\nThe proposed model is built upon a deep compressive autoencoder (CAE) with\ndiscrete latent embeddings. The encoder is equipped with residual\ntransformations to extract representative features from spikes, which are\nmapped into the latent embedding space and updated via vector quantization\n(VQ). The decoder network reconstructs spike waveforms from the quantized\nlatent embeddings. Experimental results show that the proposed model\nconsistently outperforms conventional methods by achieving much higher\ncompression ratios (20-500x) and better or comparable reconstruction\naccuracies. Testing results also indicate that CAE is robust against a diverse\nrange of imperfections, such as waveform variation and spike misalignment, and\nhas minor influence on spike sorting accuracy. Furthermore, we have estimated\nthe hardware cost and real-time performance of CAE and shown that it could\nsupport thousands of recording channels simultaneously without excessive\npower/heat dissipation. The proposed model can reduce the required data\ntransmission bandwidth in large-scale recording experiments and maintain good\nsignal qualities.

In structured prediction, the label has a rich intrinsic\nsubstructure, and the loss varies with respect to the predicted label and the\ntrue label pair. Structured SVM is an extension of binary SVM to adapt to such\nstructured tasks.\n  In the first part of the dissertation, we study the surrogate losses and its\nefficient methods. To minimize the empirical risk, a surrogate loss which upper\nbounds the loss, is used as a proxy to minimize the actual loss. Since the\nobjective function is written in terms of the surrogate loss, the choice of the\nsurrogate loss is important, and the performance depends on it. Another issue\nregarding the surrogate loss is the efficiency of the argmax label inference\nfor the surrogate loss. Efficient inference is necessary for the optimization\nsince it is often the most time-consuming step. We present a new class of\nsurrogate losses named bi-criteria surrogate loss, which is a generalization of\nthe popular surrogate losses. We first investigate an efficient method for a\nslack rescaling formulation as a starting point utilizing decomposability of\nthe model. Then, we extend the algorithm to the bi-criteria surrogate loss,\nwhich is very efficient and also shows performance improvements.\n  In the second part of the dissertation, another important issue of\nregularization is studied. Specifically, we investigate a problem of\nregularization in hierarchical classification when a structural imbalance\nexists in the label structure. We present a method to normalize the structure,\nas well as a new norm, namely shared Frobenius norm. It is suitable for\nhierarchical classification that adapts to the data in addition to the label\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 18:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

Thus, our method is a\ngeometrically-implicit method and we prove that in our formulation, there is no\nartificial penetration between the contacting rigid bodies. We solve for the\nequivalent contact point (ECP) and contact impulse of each contact patch\nsimultaneously along with the state, i.e., configuration and velocity of the\nobjects. We provide empirical evidence to show that if the number of contact\npatches between two objects is less than or equal to three, the state evolution\nof the bodies is unique, although the contact impulses and ECP may not be\nunique. We also present simulation results showing that our method can\nseamlessly capture transition between different contact modes like non-convex\npatch to point (or line contact) and vice-versa during simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 18:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

We begin by examining\nbinary disks in two dimensions and demonstrate that their critical states are\nhyperuniform as two-phase media, but not hyperuniform nor multihyperuniform as\npoint patterns formed by the particle centroids. We further confirm the\ngenerality of our findings by studying particles with a continuous size\ndistribution.

Although these systems exhibit\nonly short-range orientational order, hyperuniformity is still preserved. Our\nanalysis reveals that the redistribution of the \"mass\" of the particles rather\nthan the particle centroids is central to this dynamical process. The\nconsideration of the \"active volume fraction\" of generalized random\norganization models may help to resolve which universality class they belong to\nand hence may lead to a deeper theoretical understanding of absorbing-state\nmodels.

The detection of chromospheric activity cycles in solar-analogue and\ntwin stars, can be used to put in context the solar cycle. However, there is a\nrelatively low percentage of these stars with activity cycles detected. It is\nwell known that the cores of Ca II H&K lines are modulated by stellar activity.\nThe behaviour of Balmer and other optical lines with stellar activity is not\nyet completely understood.\n  Aims. To search for Ca II H&K, Balmer and Fe II line variations modulated by\nthe stellar activity. In particular, we apply a novel strategy to detect\npossible shape variations in the H{\\alpha} line.\n  Methods. We analyse activity signatures in HD 38858 by using HARPS and CASLEO\nspectra obtained between 2003 and 2017. We calculate the Mount Wilson index\n(S$_{MW}$), log($\\mathrm{R}'_\\mathrm{HK}$) and the statistical moments of Ca II\nH&K, Balmer and other optical lines. We search for periodicities by using the\ngeneralized Lomb-Scargle periodogram.\n  Results. We detect a long-term activity cycle of 10.8 yr in Ca II H&K and\nH{\\alpha}, being HD 38858 one of the most similar stars to the Sun for which a\ncycle has been detected. In contrast, this cycle is marginally detected in the\nFe II lines. Also, we detect a noticeable radial velocity variation, which\nseems to be produced by stellar activity.\n  Conclusions. HD 38858 is the second solar-analogue star where we find a clear\nactivity cycle which is replicated by Balmer lines. Spectral indexes based on\nthe shape of H{\\alpha} seems to be more realiable than the fluxes in the same\nline to detect activity variations. On the other hand, the cyclic modulation\ndetected gives place to a radial velocity variation, previously associated to a\nsuper-Earth planet.

In general, with\nnon-adaptive data analyses (where queries to the data are generated without\nbeing influenced by answers to previous queries) a data set containing $n$\nsamples may support exponentially many queries in $n$. This number reduces to\nlinearly many under naive adaptive data analysis, and even sophisticated\nremedies such as the Reusable Holdout (Dwork et. al 2015) only allow\nquadratically many queries in $n$.\n  In this work, we propose a new framework for adaptive science which\nexponentially improves on this number of queries under a restricted yet\nscientifically relevant setting, where the goal of the scientist is to find a\nsingle (or a few) true hypotheses about the universe based on the samples. Such\na setting may describe the search for predictive factors of some disease based\non medical data, where the analyst may wish to try a number of predictive\nmodels until a satisfactory one is found.\n  Our solution, the Generic Holdout, involves two simple ingredients: (1) a\npartitioning of the data into a exploration set and a holdout set and (2) a\nlimited exposure strategy for the holdout set. An analyst is free to use the\nexploration set arbitrarily, but when testing hypotheses against the holdout\nset, the analyst only learns the answer to the question: \"Is the given\nhypothesis true (empirically) on the holdout set?\" -- and no more information,\nsuch as \"how well\" the hypothesis fits the holdout set. The resulting scheme is\nimmediate to analyze, but despite its simplicity we do not believe our method\nis obvious, as evidenced by the many violations in practice.\n  Our proposal can be seen as an alternative to pre-registration, and allows\nresearchers to get the benefits of adaptive data analysis without the problems\nof adaptivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 21:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

However, utilizing a non-iterative\nlearning strategy can accelerate the training process of the DCNN and\nsurprisingly such approach has been rarely explored by the deep learning (DL)\ncommunity. It motivates this paper to introduce a non-iterative learning\nstrategy that eliminates the backpropagation (BP) at the top dense or fully\nconnected (FC) layers of DCNN, resulting in, lower training time and higher\nperformance. The proposed method exploits the Moore-Penrose Inverse to pull\nback the current residual error to each FC layer, generating well-generalized\nfeatures. Then using the recomputed features, i.e., the new generalized\nfeatures the weights of each FC layer is computed according to the\nMoore-Penrose Inverse.

The interplay of linearity and dynamic types\nrequires a novel approach to specifying the dynamics of the language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 05:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 May 2019 07:30:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

One popular strategy is to\nestimate disparities after controlling for observed covariates, typically with\na regression model. This approach, however, suffers from two statistical\nchallenges. First, omitted-variable bias can skew results if the model does not\ncontrol for all relevant factors; second, and conversely, included-variable\nbias can skew results if the set of controls includes irrelevant factors. Here\nwe introduce a simple three-step strategy---which we call risk-adjusted\nregression---that addresses both concerns in settings where decision makers\nhave clearly measurable objectives. In the first step, we use all available\ncovariates to estimate the utility of possible decisions. In the second step,\nwe measure disparities after controlling for these utility estimates alone,\nmitigating the problem of included-variable bias. Finally, in the third step,\nwe examine the sensitivity of results to unmeasured confounding, addressing\nconcerns about omitted-variable bias. We demonstrate this method on a detailed\ndataset of 2.2 million police stops of pedestrians in New York City, and show\nthat traditional statistical tests of discrimination can yield misleading\nresults.

Such system is typically characterized by existences of complex\nand varied motion states of different sliding nodes (pulleys), which leads to\nsignificant difficulties for analysis. A very simple but effective linear\ncomplementarity approach isdeveloped. Within this approach, the challenging and\nsignificant issue of determinations of motion states of sliding nodes, as well\nas calculations of their sliding lengths, can be handled in a standard linear\ncomplementarity formulation, and can be solved using any available efficient\nsolver for linear complementarity problem (LCP). The proposed approach\neliminates the need for traditional cumbersome predictor-corrector-based\noperations. It also opens a way to study the theory problem such as the\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution by using complementarity theories,\nwhich is generally absent from existing literature given its complexity. The\nuniqueness of the solution has been proved in this work, while the existence\nissue remains open and deserves further investigation. Multi examples involving\nboth static and dynamic analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach, as well as to reveal some novel phenomenon involved\nin sliding cable system considering frictions. The results highlight the\nability of the method in accurately handling variegated motion states of\nsliding nodes.

This opens doors to downgrade attacks, as is the case of the\nPOODLE attack [18], which exploits the client's silent fallback to downgrade\nthe protocol version to exploit the legacy version's flaws. To achieve a better\nbalance between security and backward compatibility, we propose a DNS-based\nmechanism that enables TLS servers to advertise their support for the latest\nversion of the protocol and strong ciphersuites (that provide Forward-Secrecy\nand Authenticated-Encryption simultaneously).

They apply coarse-grained TLS configurations that support (by\ndefault) legacy versions of the protocol that have known design weaknesses, and\nweak ciphersuites that provide fewer security guarantees (e.g. non Forward\nSecrecy), and silently fall back to them if the server selects to. This\nintroduces various risks including downgrade attacks such as the POODLE attack\n[15] that exploits the browsers silent fallback mechanism to downgrade the\nprotocol version in order to exploit the legacy version flaws. To achieve a\nbetter balance between security and backward compatibility, we propose a\nmechanism for fine-grained TLS configurations in web browsers based on the\nsensitivity of the domain name in the HTTPS request using a whitelisting\ntechnique. That is, the browser enforces optimal TLS configurations for\nconnections going to sensitive domains while enforcing default configurations\nfor the rest of the connections. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal\nby implementing a proof-of-concept as a Firefox browser extension. We envision\nthis mechanism as a built-in security feature in web browsers, e.g. a button\nsimilar to the \\quotes{Bookmark} button in Firefox browsers and as a\nstandardised HTTP header, to augment browsers security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 09:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

We first demonstrate that the horizons contribute\nadditional surface terms to the Gauss law constraint of the theory when gauge\ntransformations are not required to vanish on the horizons. We then consider\nthe BRST invariant path integral including these surface terms following the\nHamiltonian BRST formalism.
