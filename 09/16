We suggested to derive it either directly from the observed break\nfrequency in power spectrum of X-ray or optical lightcurves of a polar, or\nassuming the corotation. Here we apply this method to all IPs observed by\nNuSTAR (10 objects) and Swift/BAT (35 objects).

In the sensory organs, where the anatomy of neural circuits is\nhighly structured, lateral inhibition sharpens contrast among stimulus\nproperties. The impact of inhibition on stimulus processing and the involvement\nof lateral inhibition is less clear when activity propagates to the\nless-structured relay stations. Here we take a synthetic approach to\ndisentangle the impacts of inhibition from that of specialized anatomy on the\nrepertoire of evoked activity patterns, and as a result, the network capacity\nto uniquely represent different stimuli. To this aim, we blocked inhibition in\nrandomly rewired networks of cortical neurons in-vitro, and quantified response\nvariability and stimulus discrimination among stimuli provided at different\nspatial loci, before and after the blockade. We show that blocking inhibition\nquenches variability of responses evoked by repeated stimuli through any\nspatial source; for all tested response features. Despite the sharpening role\nof inhibition in the highly structured sensory organs, in these random networks\nwe find that blocking inhibition enhances stimulus discrimination between\nspatial sources of stimulation, when based on response features that emphasize\nthe relation among spike times recorded through different electrodes. We\nfurther show that under intact inhibition, responses to a given stimulus are a\nnoisy version of those revealed by blocking inhibition; such that intact\ninhibition disrupts an otherwise coherent, wave propagation of activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 16:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

Recently, a\nnew layout for HCN with energy harvesting-SBSs (EH-SBSs) has been proposed to\nreduce inter-cell interference and power consumption; and increase system\nenergy efficiency. In this paper, an energy efficient joint user association\nand BS on-off scheme for an HCN having diverse energy source(s) is proposed,\nwhich aims at utilizing the harvested energy efficiently in order to reduce the\non-grid power consumption. The scheme operates in two phases. First, it decides\nwhich BS should be in off, sleep or active mode and iteratively updates its\ntransmit power based on energy arrival and consumption, to minimize\ninterference and on-grid power consumption. Secondly, for further reduction in\non-grid power consumption, the user discovers and associates itself with the\nnearest available EH-SBS. The system energy consumption for the proposed scheme\nis numerically evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results\nreveal that the proposed scheme shows significantly better results as compared\nto other schemes in the literature in terms of grid power consumption and\nenergy efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 20:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

The proposed\nscheme has better resolution property than previous WCNS's. This is achieved by\nusing a compact (or spatially implicit) form instead of the traditional fully\nexplicit form for the nonlinear interpolation. Since compact interpolation\nschemes tend to have lower dispersion errors compared to explicit interpolation\nschemes, the proposed scheme has the ability to resolve more fine-scale\nfeatures while still having the ability to provide sufficiently localized\ndissipation to capture shocks and discontinuities robustly. Approximate\ndispersion relation characteristics of this scheme are analyzed to show the\nsuperior resolution properties of the scheme compared to other WCNS's of\nsimilar orders of accuracy. Conservative and high-order accurate boundary\nschemes are also proposed for non-periodic problems. Further, a new\nconservative flux-difference form for compact finite difference schemes is\nderived and allows for the use of positivity-preserving limiters for improved\nrobustness.

Urban area is a\nmeasure of scale dependence, which indicates the scale-free distribution of\nurban patterns. Thus, the urban description based on characteristic lengths\nshould be replaced by urban characterization based on scaling. Fractal geometry\nis one powerful tool for scaling analysis of cities. Fractal parameters can be\ndefined by entropy and correlation functions. However, how to understand city\nfractals is still a pending question. By means of logic deduction and ideas\nfrom fractal theory, this paper is devoted to discussing fractals and fractal\ndimensions of urban landscape. The main points of this work are as follows.\nFirst, urban form can be treated as pre-fractals rather than real fractals, and\nfractal properties of cities are only valid within certain scaling ranges.\nSecond, the topological dimension of city fractals based on urban area is 0,\nthus the minimum fractal dimension value of fractal cities is equal to or\ngreater than 0. Third, fractal dimension of urban form is used to substitute\nurban area, and it is better to define city fractals in a 2-dimensional\nembedding space, thus the maximum fractal dimension value of urban form is 2. A\nconclusion can be reached that urban form can be explored as fractals within\ncertain ranges of scales and fractal geometry can be applied to the spatial\nanalysis of the scale-free aspects of urban morphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 04:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 03:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 09:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 05:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 11:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Detecting multiple\nabnormalities in each type of images is necessary for better and more accurate\ndiagnosis procedure and medical decisions. In recent years portable medical\nimaging devices such as capsule endoscopy and digital dermatoscope have been\nintroduced and made the diagnosis procedure easier and more efficient.

To address this problem, we propose a bifurcated\nstructure for convolutional neural networks performing both classification and\nsegmentation of multiple abnormalities simultaneously.

Finally, results of the\nclassification and segmentation directions are fused to obtain the classified\nsegmentation map. Proposed framework is simulated using four frequent\ngastrointestinal abnormalities as well as three dermoscopic lesions and for\nevaluation of the proposed framework the results are compared with the\ncorresponding ground truth map.

Recent studies have found trends in\nthe evolution of music styles, but little is known about their relations to the\nevolution theory. Here we analyze Western classical music data and find\nstatistical evolutionary laws. For example, distributions of the frequencies of\nsome rare musical events (e.g. dissonant intervals) exhibit steady increase in\nthe mean and standard deviation as well as constancy of their ratio. We then\nstudy an evolutionary model where creators learn their data-generation models\nfrom past data and generate new data that will be socially selected by\nevaluators according to the content dissimilarity (novelty) and style\nconformity (typicality) with respect to the past data.

In addition, the same model with\ndifferent parameterization can predict the evolution of Japanese enka music,\nwhich is developed in a different society and has a qualitatively different\ntendency of evolution.

Finding the optimal GXY\nwithout paired data is an ill-posed problem, so appropriate constraints are\nrequired to obtain reasonable solutions. One of the most prominent constraints\nis cycle consistency, which enforces the translated image by GXY to be\ntranslated back to the input image by an inverse mapping GYX. While cycle\nconsistency requires the simultaneous training of GXY and GY X, recent studies\nhave shown that one-sided domain mapping can be achieved by preserving pairwise\ndistances between images. Although cycle consistency and distance preservation\nsuccessfully constrain the solution space, they overlook the special properties\nthat simple geometric transformations do not change the semantic structure of\nimages. Based on this special property, we develop a geometry-consistent\ngenerative adversarial network (GcGAN), which enables one-sided unsupervised\ndomain mapping. GcGAN takes the original image and its counterpart image\ntransformed by a predefined geometric transformation as inputs and generates\ntwo images in the new domain coupled with the corresponding\ngeometry-consistency constraint.

At the same time, to serve increasing user requirements, modern cloud\nproviders are operating multiple geographically distributed data centers.\nDistributed data center infrastructure changes the rules of cloud control, as\nenergy costs depend on current regional electricity prices and temperatures\nthat we call geotemporal inputs. Furthermore, pricing policies at which cloud\nproviders can offer computational resources depend on the quality of service\n(QoS). With such pricing schemes and the increasing energy costs in data\ncentres, balancing energy savings with performance and revenue losses is a\nchallenging problem. Existing cloud control methods are suitable only for a\nsingle data center or do not consider all the available cloud control actions\nthat can reduce energy costs in geographically distributed data centers. In\nthis thesis, we propose a pervasive cloud control approach consisting of\nmultiple methods for dynamic resource reallocation and hardware configuration\nadapted to volatile geotemporal inputs. The proposed methods consider the QoS\nimpact of cloud control actions and the data quality limits of time series\nforecasting methods. We offer a cloud controller design that supports future\nextensions when new decision support components need to be added. We also\npropose novel pricing schemes which account for the computational resource\navailability and costs that arise from our cloud control approach to enable\nboth flexible, energy-aware and high performance cloud computing. We evaluate\nour methods empirically and in a number of simulations using historical traces\nof electricity prices, temperatures, workloads and other data. Our results show\nthat significant energy cost savings are possible without harming the QoS or\nservice revenue in geographically distributed cloud computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 10:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

The experience of the driver through\nthe steering wheel may vary significantly depending on the steering control\nstrategy of the system. In this study, we examine how driving experience\nchanges according to various steering control strategies. Based on the\npreliminary study and typical LKAS parameters, nine control strategies (3\ntorque amounts (TOR) x 3 deviations to start control (DEV)) were designed as a\nprototype. Eighteen participants participated in evaluating each strategy in a\nhighway environment provided by a driving simulator. Two-way repeated measure\nANOVA was used to assess the effects of the system. Both the objective measures\n(standard deviation of lane position, steering reversal rate, and root mean\nsquare of lateral speed) and subjective measures (pleasure and arousal of\nemotion, trust, disturbance, and satisfaction) are analyzed. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that all dependent measures are significant. As the TOR\nincreased, SDLP decreased. However, no difference is observed between the 2-Nm\nand 3-Nm TOR in terms of trust and satisfaction. The high disturbance and\nnegative emotion in 3 Nm appear to be the cause. In terms of the DEV, the high\nlevel of the root mean square of the lateral speed is observed at 0.8 m.\nFurther, negative effects are found in pleasure, trust, and satisfaction.

Network theoretical measures and certain\ntopological principles are computed from the entire brain, however there is a\nneed to separate and understand the underlying subnetworks which contribute\ntowards these observed holistic connectomic alterations. One organizational\nprinciple is the rich-club - a core subnetwork of brain regions that are\nstrongly connected, forming a high-cost, high-capacity backbone that is\ncritical for effective communication in the network. Investigations primarily\nfocus on its alterations with disease and age. Here, we present a systematic\nanalysis of not only the rich-club, but also other subnetworks derived from\nthis backbone - namely feeder and seeder subnetworks. Our analysis is applied\nto structural connectomes in a normal cohort from a large, publicly available\nlifespan study. We demonstrate changes in rich-club membership with age\nalongside a shift in importance from 'peripheral' seeder to feeder subnetworks.\nOur results show a refinement within the rich-club structure (increase in\ntransitivity and betweenness centrality), as well as increased efficiency in\nthe feeder subnetwork and decreased measures of network integration and\nsegregation in the seeder subnetwork. These results demonstrate the different\ndevelopmental patterns when analyzing the connectome stratified according to\nits rich-club and the potential of utilizing this subnetwork analysis to reveal\nthe evolution of brain architectural alterations across the life-span.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

In the tasting sessions,\nthe assessors follow their own criteria to place samples on a tablecloth,\naccording to the similarity between samples. In order to analyse the data\ncollected, first a geometric clustering is performed to each tablecloth,\nextracting connections between the samples. Then, these connections are used to\nconstruct a global similarity matrix. Finally, a graph drawing algorithm is\nused to obtain a 2D consensus graphic, which reflects the global opinion of the\npanel by (1) positioning closer those samples that have been globally perceived\nas similar and (2) showing the strength of the connections between samples. The\nproposal is validated by performing four tasting sessions, with three types of\npanels tasting different wines, and by developing a new software to implement\nthe proposed techniques. The results obtained show that the graphics provide\nsimilar positionings of the samples as the consensus maps obtained by multiple\nfactor analysis (MFA), further providing extra information about connections\nbetween samples, not present in any previous method.

In this direction, we have recently introduced Forman's\ndiscretization of Ricci curvature to the realm of undirected networks.\nInvestigation of this edge-centric network measure, Forman-Ricci curvature, in\ndiverse model and real-world undirected networks revealed that the curvature\nmeasure captures several aspects of the organization of undirected complex\nnetworks. However, many important real-world networks are inherently directed\nin nature, and the definition of the Forman-Ricci curvature for undirected\nnetworks is unsuitable for the analysis of such directed networks. Hence, we\nhere extend the Forman-Ricci curvature for undirected networks to the case of\ndirected networks. The simple mathematical formula for the Forman-Ricci\ncurvature of a directed edge elegantly incorporates vertex weights, edge\nweights and edge direction. Furthermore we have compared the Forman-Ricci\ncurvature with the adaptation to directed networks of another discrete notion\nof Ricci curvature, namely, the well established Ollivier-Ricci curvature.\nHowever, the two above-mentioned curvature measures do not account for\nhigher-order correlations between vertices. To this end, we adjusted Forman's\noriginal definition of Ricci curvature to account for directed simplicial\ncomplexes and also explored the potential of this new, augmented type of\nForman-Ricci curvature, in directed complex networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2018 17:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

It provides several degrees of freedom in time (available on\ndemand), space (mobile) and it can be used for multiple purposes (self-healing,\noffloading, coverage extension or disaster recovery). This is why the wide\ndeployment of drone-based communications has the potential to be integrated in\nthe 5G standard. In this paper, we utilize a grid of drones to provide cellular\ncoverage to disaster-struck regions where the terrestrial infrastructure is\ntotally damaged due to earthquake, flood, etc. We propose solutions for the\nmost challenging issues facing drone networks which are limited battery energy\nand limited backhauling. Our proposed solution based mainly on using three\ntypes of drones; tethered backhaul drone (provides high capacity backhauling),\nuntethered powering drone (provides on the fly battery charging) and untethered\ncommunication drone (provides cellular connectivity). Hence, an optimization\nproblem is formulated to minimize the energy consumption of drones in addition\nto determining the placement of these drones and guaranteeing a minimum rate\nfor the users. The simulation results show that we can provide unlimited\ncellular service to the disaster-affected region under certain conditions with\na guaranteed minimum rate for each user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 00:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}
