Our main\nconclusion is that, under reasonable physiological conditions, unraveling due\nto viscous drag can occur within a few hundred milliseconds, and is accelerated\nif the skein is pinned at a surface such as the mouth of a predator.

In the\npresent work, taking Cu/Ni as a model system, a general phenomenon is reported\nwhich results in sharpening of interfaces upon thermal annealing, even in\nmiscible systems. Anomalous x-ray reflectivity from a Cu/Ni multilayer has been\nused to study the evolution of interfaces with thermal annealing. Annealing at\n423 K results in sharpening of interfaces by about 38%. This is the temperature\nat which no asymmetry exists in the inter-diffusivities of Ni and Cu. Thus, the\neffect is very general in nature, and is different from the one reported in the\nliterature, which requires a large asymmetry in the diffusivities of the two\nconstituents [Z. Erd\\'elyi et al., Science 306, 1913 (2004).].

In\nthis paradigm, known as streaming learning, a learner is trained online, in a\nsingle pass, from a data stream that cannot be assumed to be independent and\nidentically distributed (iid). Streaming learning will cause conventional deep\nneural networks (DNNs) to fail for two reasons: 1) they need multiple passes\nthrough the entire dataset; and 2) non-iid data will cause catastrophic\nforgetting. An old fix to both of these issues is rehearsal. To learn a new\nexample, rehearsal mixes it with previous examples, and then this mixture is\nused to update the DNN. Full rehearsal is slow and memory intensive because it\nstores all previously observed examples, and its effectiveness for preventing\ncatastrophic forgetting has not been studied in modern DNNs. Here, we describe\nthe ExStream algorithm for memory efficient rehearsal and compare it to\nalternatives. We find that full rehearsal can eliminate catastrophic forgetting\nin a variety of streaming learning settings, with ExStream performing well\nusing far less memory and computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 18:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2019 23:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

We show that if our universe is flat and has one\ncompact dimension of appropriate size (slab topology), this would suppress\nlarge-angle temperature correlations while maintaining a low-$\\ell$ angular\npower spectrum consistent with observations. The optimal length appears to be\n$1.4$ times the conformal radius of the CMB's last scattering surface\n($\\chi_{rec}$). We construct the probability distribution function of the\nstatistic $S_{1/2}$ using simulated Sachs-Wolf-only skies for each of several\nvalues of $L_z/\\chi_{rec}$. For $L_z\\simeq1.4\\chi_{rec}$ the $p$-value of four\nstandard masked Planck maps is $p\\simeq0.15$, compared to $p\\lesssim0.003$ for\nthe conventional topologically trivial space. The mean angular power spectrum\n$\\langle C_{\\ell} \\rangle$ of the $L_z=1.4\\chi_{rec}$ slab space matches the\nobserved power spectrum at $2\\leq\\ell\\lesssim6$ -- including a substantially\nsuppressed quadrupole $C_2$, a slightly suppressed octopole $C_3$, and\nunsuppressed higher multipoles.

In this paper, we develop an\nautonomous system for drones to race fully autonomously using only onboard\nresources. Instead of commonly used visual navigation methods, such as\nsimultaneous localization and mapping and visual inertial odometry, which are\ncomputationally expensive for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), we developed the\nhighly efficient snake gate detection algorithm for visual navigation, which\ncan detect the gate at 20HZ on a Parrot Bebop drone. Then, with the gate\ndetection result, we developed a robust pose estimation algorithm which has\nbetter tolerance to detection noise than a state-of-the-art perspective-n-point\nmethod. During the race, sometimes the gates are not in the drone's field of\nview. For this case, a state prediction-based feed-forward control strategy is\ndeveloped to steer the drone to fly to the next gate. Experiments show that the\ndrone can fly a half-circle with 1.5m radius within 2 seconds with only 30cm\nerror at the end of the circle without any position feedback. Finally, the\nwhole system is tested in a complex environment (a showroom in the faculty of\nAerospace Engineering, TU Delft).

We introduce a general problem\nformulation that encompasses known types of item relocation problems such as\nmulti-agent path finding (MAPF) and token swapping (TSWAP). In this formulation\nwe express two new types of relocation problems derived from token swapping\nthat we call token rotation (TROT) and token permutation (TPERM). Our solving\napproach for item relocation combines satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) with\nconflict-based search (CBS). We interpret CBS in the SMT framework where we\nstart with the basic model and refine the model with a collision resolution\nconstraint whenever a collision between items occurs in the current solution.\nThe key difference between the standard CBS and our SMT-based modification of\nCBS (SMT-CBS) is that the standard CBS branches the search to resolve the\ncollision while in SMT-CBS we iteratively add a single disjunctive collision\nresolution constraint. Experimental evaluation on several benchmarks shows that\nthe SMT-CBS algorithm significantly outperforms the standard CBS. We also\ncompared SMT-CBS with a modification of the SAT-based MDD-SAT solver that uses\nan eager modeling of item relocation in which all potential collisions are\neliminated by constrains in advance.

The algorithmic framework builds on dual methods and\ndynamic average consensus; the sequence of test points is formed by iteratively\nminimizing a local dual model of the overall objective where the coefficients,\ni.e., approximated subgradients of the objective, are supplied by the dynamic\naverage consensus scheme.

The attacker can feed fictitious sensor\nreadings to the controller using its estimate of the plant dynamics and mimic\nthe legitimate plant operation.

In the case of scalar plants, we derive an\nupper bound on the attacker's deception probability for any measurable control\npolicy when the attacker uses an arbitrary learning algorithm to estimate the\nsystem dynamics.

There are different kinds of\ndualities and they have been extremely useful to uncover the underlying strong\ncoupling dynamics of gauge theories in various dimensions and those of the\ndiverse string theories. Perhaps the oldest example exhibiting this property is\nMaxwell theory, which interchanges electric and magnetic fields. An extension\nof this duality involving the sources is also possible if the magnetic monopole\nis incorporated. At the present time a lot has been understood about duality in\nnon-Abelian gauge theories as in the case of N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories\nin four dimensions or in the Seiberg-Witten duality for N=2 theories. Moreover,\na duality that relates a gravitational theory (or a string theory) and a\nconformal gauge theory, as in the case of gauge/gravity correspondence, have\nbeen also studied with considerable detail. The case of duality between two\ngravitational theories is the so called gravitational duality. At the present\ntime, this duality has not been exhaustively studied, however some advances\nhave been reported in the literature. In the present paper we give a general\noverview of this subject. In particular we will focus on non-Abelian dualities,\napplied to various theories of gravity as developed by the authors, based in\nthe Rocek-Verlinde duality procedure. Finally, as a new development in this\ndirection, we study the gravitational duality in Hitchin's gravity in seven and\nsix dimensions and their relation is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 06:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

Building on sparse matrix linear algebra, we show how to structure\nthe complete subdivision process into a sequence of algebra operations. By\nrestructuring and grouping these operations, we adapt the process for different\nuse cases, such as regular subdivision of dynamic meshes, uniform subdivision\nfor immutable topology, and feature-adaptive subdivision for efficient\nrendering of animated models. As the same machinery is used for all use cases,\nidentical subdivision results are achieved in all parts of the production\npipeline. As a second contribution, we show how these linear algebra\nformulations can effectively be translated into efficient GPU kernels. Applying\nour strategies to $\\sqrt{3}$, Loop and Catmull-Clark subdivision shows\nsignificant speedups of our approach compared to state-of-the-art solutions,\nwhile we completely avoid serial preprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 07:17:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 06:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 10:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

By combining these two mechanisms in a minimal\nsolvable dynamic model, we confirm theoretically the long-held and empirically\nestablished hypothesis that homophily can be amplified by the triadic closure\nmechanism.

Also,\nthere is no need for preset thresholds since the hysteresis ones are defined\nautomatically and adaptively depending on the number of images that the voxel\nisprojected onto.

The\nmixture is driven by a thermostat constituted by two terms: a stochastic force\nand a drag force proportional to the particle velocity. The combined action of\nboth forces attempts to mimic the interaction of solid particles with the\ninterstitial surrounding gas. As with ordinary gases, the use of IMM allows us\nto exactly evaluate the velocity moments of the Boltzmann collision operator\nand so, it opens up the possibility of obtaining the exact forms of the\nNavier--Stokes transport coefficients of the granular mixture. In this work,\nthe diffusion coefficients associated with the mass flux are explicitly\ndetermined in terms of the parameters of the mixture. As a first step, the\nsteady homogeneous state reached by the system when the energy lost by\ncollisions is compensated for by the energy injected by the thermostat is\naddressed. In this steady state, the ratio of kinetic temperatures are\ndetermined and compared against molecular dynamics simulations for inelastic\nhard spheres (IHS). The comparison shows an excellent agreement, even for\nstrong inelasticity and/or disparity in masses and diameters. As a second step,\nthe set of kinetic equations for the mixture is solved by means of the\nChapman-Enskog method for states near homogeneous steady states. In the\nfirst-order approximation, the mass flux is obtained and the corresponding\ndiffusion transport coefficients identified. The results show that the\npredictions for IMM obtained in this work coincide with those previously\nderived for IHS in the first-Sonine approximation when the non-Gaussian\ncorrections to the zeroth-order approximation are neglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 09:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

We exploited variable\nstars from the fourth release of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment\n(OGLE). We used mainly pulsating variable stars and investigated their\npotential association with the SMCNOD using their spatial distribution and\ndistances. We found four rather spatially concentrated anomalous Cepheids and\neight evenly dispersed RR~Lyrae stars to be most likely members of this\noverdensity. The anomalous Cepheids inside the SMCNOD trace possible\nintermediate-age population with ages ranging between $2-4.5$ Gyr. The age\ndistribution of anomalous Cepheids seems to be in a good agreement with the age\ndistribution of anomalous Cepheids in the SMC. Using empirical relations for\nRR~Lyrae stars we determined the median metallicity for a possible old\npopulation in the SMCNOD to be $\\rm [Fe/H]_{\\rm SMCNOD}=-1.71\\pm0.21$ dex,\nwhich is in agreement with median metallicity of the old SMC population. The\ndensity profile for anomalous Cepheids shows a small anomaly at the position of\nthe SMCNOD, on the other hand, RR~Lyrae variables show no such deviation. The\nprobability of finding the observed number of variable stars at the location of\nthe SMCNOD by chance is very low for anomalous Cepheids (0.7 %) but high for\nRR~Lyrae stars (13.0 %). Based on its variable stars content, we thus confirm\nthe presence of a modest overdensity in intermediate-age stars in the SMCNOD\nand conclude that it probably has its origin in the SMC rather than to be the\nremnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 09:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

A convex bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $(X,Y)$ and an\nordering $X=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$, is a bipartite graph such that for each $y \\in\nY$, the neighborhood of $y$ in $X$ appears consecutively. $G$ is said to have\nconvexity with respect to $X$.

In this paper, we present a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in convex\nbipartite graphs and further we obtain a linear-time algorithm for this graph\nclass.

In this work, we\nextend the span error bound theory to weighted SVM and we introduce effective\nhyperparameter selection methods for the weighted SVM algorithm. The\nsignificance of the presented work is that enables the application of span\nbound and span-rule with weighted SVM. The span bound is an upper bound of the\nleave-one-out error that can be calculated using a single trained SVM model.\nThis is important since leave-one-out error is an almost unbiased estimator of\nthe test error. Similarly, the span-rule gives the actual value of the\nleave-one-out error. Thus, one can apply span bound and span-rule as\ncomputationally lightweight alternatives of leave-one-out procedure for\nhyperparameter selection.

As logistic regression is widely known not having a\nclosed-form solution, it is usually randomly initialized, leading to several\ndeficiencies especially in transfer learning where all the layers except for\nthe last task-specific layer are initialized using a pre-trained model. The\ndeficiencies include slow convergence speed, possibility of stuck in local\nminimum, and the risk of over-fitting. To address those deficiencies, we first\nstudy the properties of logistic regression and propose a closed-form\napproximate solution named regularized Gaussian classifier (RGC).

The goal in\nsparsification is to reduce the number of constraints in a problem instance\nwithout changing the answer, such that a bound on the number of resulting\nconstraints can be given in terms of the number of variables n. We investigate\nhow the worst-case sparsification size depends on the types of constraints\nallowed in the problem formulation (the constraint language). Two algorithmic\nresults are presented. The first result essentially shows that for any arity k,\nthe only constraint type for which no nontrivial sparsification is possible has\nexactly one falsifying assignment, and corresponds to logical OR (up to\nnegations). Our second result concerns linear sparsification, that is, a\nreduction to an equivalent instance with O(n) constraints. Using linear algebra\nover rings of integers modulo prime powers, we give an elegant necessary and\nsufficient condition for a constraint type to be captured by a degree-1\npolynomial over such a ring, which yields linear sparsifications. The\ncombination of these algorithmic results allows us to prove two\ncharacterizations that capture the optimal sparsification sizes for a range of\nBoolean CSPs. For NP-complete Boolean CSPs whose constraints are symmetric (the\nsatisfaction depends only on the number of 1 values in the assignment, not on\ntheir positions), we give a complete characterization of which constraint\nlanguages allow for a linear sparsification.

The probability of a query\ncan be then computed from the set of its explanations by building a Binary\nDecision Diagram (BDD). The set of explanations can be found using the tableau\nalgorithm, which has to handle non-determinism.

Nuclear winds\nare often seen in the X-ray spectra through Fe K shell transitions and some of\nthem are called ultra fast outflows (UFOs) due to their high velocities, up to\nsome fractions of the speed of light. If they were able to transfer some\npercentage of the AGN luminosity to the host galaxy, this might be enough to\ntrigger an efficient feedback mechanism. We aim to establish new constraints on\nthe covering fraction and on the kinematic properties of the UFO in the\npowerful (L(bol) ~ 10^(47) erg/s) quasar PDS 456, an established Rosetta stone\nfor studying AGN feedback from disk winds.

We analyze\ntwo sets of simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations taken in September\n2013 and reported in Nardini et al. (2015) as having similar broadband spectral\nproperties. We fit the Fe K features with a P-Cygni profile between 5 and 14\nkeV, using a novel Monte Carlo model for the WINd Emission (WINE).

We check the reliability of\nthe WINE model by performing extensive simulations of joint XMM-Newton and\nNuSTAR observations. Furthermore, we test the accuracy of the WINE model in\nrecovering the geometrical properties of UFOs by simulating observations with\nthe forthcoming X-ray observatory ATHENA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 13:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

For the second exemplary application, spongy-continuous\nmesopore systems are generated in the macroporous PS-b-P2VP monoliths by\nselective-swelling induced pore generation. Infiltrating the spongy-continuous\nmesopore systems with ink allows capillary microstamping of continuous ink\nfilms with holes at the positions of the macropores onto glass slides\ncompatible with advanced light microscopy. Capillary microstamping can be\nperformed multiple times under ambient conditions without re-inking and without\nquality deterioration of the stamped patterns. The macroporous PS-b-P2VP\nmonoliths are prepared by double replication of primary macroporous silicon\nmolds via secondary polydimethylsiloxane molds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 13:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

In the instance of data sets for visual kinship verification,\none such unintended signal could be that the faces are cropped from the same\nphotograph, since faces from the same photograph are more likely to be from the\nsame family. In this paper we investigate the influence of this artefactual\ndata inference in published data sets for kinship verification.\n  To this end, we obtain a large dataset, and train a CNN classifier to\ndetermine if two faces are from the same photograph or not. Using this\nclassifier alone as a naive classifier of kinship, we demonstrate near state of\nthe art results on five public benchmark data sets for kinship verification -\nachieving over 90% accuracy on one of them. Thus, we conclude that faces\nderived from the same photograph are a strong inadvertent signal in all the\ndata sets we examined, and it is likely that the fraction of kinship explained\nby existing kinship models is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 13:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 12:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

This effectiveness largely stems from\nthe capacity of these models to infer salient temporal dynamics over long\nhorizons; these are encoded into the obtained neural attention (NA)\ndistributions. However, existing NA formulations essentially constitute\npoint-wise selection mechanisms over the observed source sequences; that is,\nattention weights computation relies on the assumption that each source\nsequence element is independent of the rest. Unfortunately, although\nconvenient, this assumption fails to account for higher-order dependencies\nwhich might be prevalent in real-world data. This paper addresses these\nlimitations by leveraging Quantum-Statistical modeling arguments. Specifically,\nour work broadens the notion of NA, by attempting to account for the case that\nthe NA model becomes inherently incapable of discerning between individual\nsource elements; this is assumed to be the case due to higher-order temporal\ndynamics. On the contrary, we postulate that in some cases selection may be\nfeasible only at the level of pairs of source sequence elements. To this end,\nwe cast NA into inference of an attention density matrix (ADM) approximation.\nWe derive effective training and inference algorithms, and evaluate our\napproach in the context of a machine translation (MT) application. We perform\nexperiments with challenging benchmark datasets.

The cosmic web structure is extracted via the persistent skeleton\nas implemented in the DISPERSE algorithm. It is found that the spin of low-mass\ngalaxies is more likely to be aligned with the filaments of the cosmic web and\nto lie within the plane of the walls while more massive galaxies tend to have a\nspin perpendicular to the axis of the filaments and to the walls. The mass\ntransition is detected with a significance of 9 sigmas. This galactic alignment\nis consistent with the alignment of the spin of dark haloes found in pure dark\nmatter simulations and with predictions from (anisotropic) tidal torque theory.\nHowever, unlike haloes, the alignment of low-mass galaxies is weak and\ndisappears at low redshifts while the orthogonal spin orientation of massive\ngalaxies is strong and increases with time, probably as a result of mergers. At\nfixed mass, alignments are correlated with galaxy morphology: the high-redshift\nalignment is dominated by spiral galaxies while elliptical centrals are mainly\nresponsible for the perpendicular signal. These predictions for spin alignments\nwith respect to cosmic filaments and unprecendently walls are successfully\ncompared with existing observations. The alignment of the shape of galaxies\nwith the different components of the cosmic web is also investigated. A\ncoherent and stronger signal is found in terms of shape at high mass.

Coded computation utilizes concepts from erasure coding to mitigate the\neffect of stragglers by running \"coded\" copies of tasks comprising a job.\nStragglers are typically treated as erasures in this process. While this is\nuseful, there are issues with applying, e.g., MDS codes in a straightforward\nmanner. Specifically, several applications such as matrix-vector products deal\nwith sparse matrices. MDS codes typically require dense linear combinations of\nsubmatrices of the original matrix which destroy their inherent sparsity. This\nis problematic as it results in significantly higher processing times for\ncomputing the submatrix-vector products in coded computation. Furthermore, it\nalso ignores partial computations at stragglers.\n  In this work, we propose a fine-grained model that quantifies the level of\nnon-trivial coding needed to obtain the benefits of coding in matrix-vector\ncomputation.

In contrast, RGB-D scene\nrecognition is still underdeveloped in comparison, due to two limitations of\nRGB-D data we address in this paper. The first limitation is the lack of depth\ndata for training deep learning models. Rather than fine tuning or transferring\nRGB-specific features, we address this limitation by proposing an architecture\nand a two-step training approach that directly learns effective depth-specific\nfeatures using weak supervision via patches. The resulting RGB-D model also\nbenefits from more complementary multimodal features. Another limitation is the\nshort range of depth sensors (typically 0.5m to 5.5m), resulting in depth\nimages not capturing distant objects in the scenes that RGB images can. We show\nthat this limitation can be addressed by using RGB-D videos, where more\ncomprehensive depth information is accumulated as the camera travels across the\nscene. Focusing on this scenario, we introduce the ISIA RGB-D video dataset to\nevaluate RGB-D scene recognition with videos. Our video recognition\narchitecture combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that\nare trained in three steps with increasingly complex data to learn effective\nfeatures (i.e. patches, frames and sequences).

The two most common examples are Nesterov's method, and Polyak's\nmomentum technique. In this paper two new algorithms are introduced for root\nfinding problems: 1) PolSA is a root finding algorithm with specially designed\nmatrix momentum, and 2) NeSA can be regarded as a variant of Nesterov's\nalgorithm, or a simplification of PolSA. The PolSA algorithm is new even in the\ncontext of optimization (when cast as a root finding problem).\n  The research surveyed in this paper is motivated by applications to\nreinforcement learning. It is well known that most variants of TD- and\nQ-learning may be cast as SA (stochastic approximation) algorithms, and the\ntools from general SA theory can be used to investigate convergence and bounds\non convergence rate. In particular, the asymptotic variance is a common metric\nof performance for SA algorithms, and is also one among many metrics used in\nassessing the performance of stochastic optimization algorithms. There are two\nwell known SA techniques that are known to have optimal asymptotic variance:\nthe Ruppert-Polyak averaging technique, and stochastic Newton-Raphson (SNR).\nThe former algorithm can have extremely bad transient performance, and the\nlatter can be computationally expensive. It is demonstrated here that parameter\nestimates from the new PolSA algorithm couple with those of the ideal (but more\ncomplex) SNR algorithm. The new algorithm is thus a third approach to obtain\noptimal asymptotic covariance.\n  These strong results require assumptions on the model. A linearized model is\nconsidered, and the noise is assumed to be a martingale difference sequence.\nNumerical results are obtained in a non-linear setting that is the motivation\nfor this work: In PolSA implementations of Q-learning it is observed that\ncoupling occurs with SNR in this non-ideal setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 15:32:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 23:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Yet, during development, when building a\nknowledge base of the world is occurring, the ability to selectively allocate\nattentional resources is limited (e.g., Amso & Scerif, 2015). In adulthood,\nresearch has demonstrated that surrounding the spatial location of attentional\nfocus is a suppressive field, resulting from top-down attention promoting the\nprocessing of relevant stimuli and inhibiting surrounding distractors (e.g.,\nHopf et al., 2006). It is not fully known, however, whether this phenomenon\nmanifests in development. In the current study, we examined whether spatial\nsuppression surrounding the focus of visual attention is exhibited in\ndevelopmental age groups. Participants between 12 and 27 years of age exhibited\nspatial suppression surrounding their focus of visual attention. Their accuracy\nincreased as a function of the separation distance between a spatially cued\n(and attended) target and a second target, suggesting that a ring of\nsuppression surrounded the attended target. When a central cue was instead\npresented and therefore attention was no longer spatially cued, surround\nsuppression was not observed, indicating that our initial findings of\nsuppression were indeed related to the focus of attention. Attentional surround\nsuppression was not observed in 8- to 11-years-olds, even with a longer spatial\ncue presentation time, demonstrating that the lack of the effect at these ages\nis not due to slowed attentional feedback processes. Our findings demonstrate\nthat top-down attentional processes are still immature until approximately 12\nyears of age, and that they continue to be refined throughout adolescence,\nconverging well with previous research on attentional development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 01:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

California\nis divided into 16 climate zones, for example, and each zone imposes different\nenergy-related building standards -- so for example different zones have\ndifferent roofing standards. Although developed long ago, these zones continue\nto shape urban policy. New climate zone definitions are now emerging in urban\nsettings. Both the County of Los Angeles and the US Department of Energy have\nrecently adopted refined zones -- for restructuring electricity rates, and for\nscoring home energy efficiency. Defining new zones is difficult, however,\nbecause climates depend on variables that are difficult to map.\n  In this paper we show that Los Angeles climate zones can be inferred from\nenergy use data. We have studied residential electricity consumption (EC)\npatterns in Los Angeles data. This data permits identification of geographical\nzones whose EC patterns are characteristically different from surrounding\nregions. These regions have topographic boundaries in Los Angeles consistent\nwith microclimates.\n  Specifically, our key finding is that EC-microclimate zones -- regions in\nwhich block groups have similar Electricity Consumption patterns over time --\nresemble environmental microclimate zones. Because they conform to\nmicroclimates, but are based directly on EC data, these zones can be useful in\nurban energy management.\n  We also show how microclimates and household electricity consumption in Los\nAngeles are strongly linked to socioeconomic variables like income and\npopulation density. These links permit data-driven development of microclimate\nzones that support zone-specific modeling and improved energy policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

One\nof the major motivations of our study is the 3D human body generation in\nvarious applications. We develop a novel method that can generate the desired\nbody with customized characteristic values. The proposed method follows a\nmachine-learning flavour that generates the inferred geometric body with the\ninput characteristic parameters from a training dataset. One of the critical\ningredients and novelties of our method is the borrowing of inverse scattering\ntechniques in the theory of wave propagation to the body generation. This is\ndone by establishing a delicate one-to-one correspondence between a geometric\nbody and the far-field pattern of a source scattering problem governed by the\nHelmholtz system. It in turn enables us to establish a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the geometric body space and the function space defined\nby the far-field patterns. Hence, the far-field patterns can act as the shape\ngenerators. The shape generation with prescribed characteristic parameters is\nachieved by first manipulating the shape generators and then reconstructing the\ncorresponding geometric body from the obtained shape generator by a stable\nmultiple-frequency Fourier method. Our method is easy to implement and produces\nmore efficient and stable body generations. We provide both theoretical\nanalysis and extensive numerical experiments for the proposed method. The study\nis the first attempt to introduce inverse scattering approaches in combination\nwith machine learning to the geometric body generation and it opens up many\nopportunities for further developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 12:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}
