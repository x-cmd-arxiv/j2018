Specific\ncomputational models, anchored in biophysics, for generating different types of\nnetwork dynamics, and with a relation to psychiatric symptoms, will be briefly\nreviewed, as well as methodological approaches for reconstructing the system\ndynamics from observed time series (like fMRI or EEG recordings).

Meanwhile, global\noptimization algorithms such as branch-and-bound can find optimal solutions but\nwith prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, to obtain\nnear-optimal solutions at affordable complexity, we propose to approximate the\nbranch-and-bound algorithm via machine learning. Specifically, the pruning\nprocedure in branch-and-bound is formulated as a sequential decision problem,\nfollowed by learning the oracle's action via imitation learning. A unique\nadvantage of this framework is that the training process only requires a small\ndataset, and it is scalable to problem instances with larger dimensions than\nthe training setting. This is achieved by identifying and leveraging the\nproblem-size independent features. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the\nlearning based framework significantly outperforms competing methods, with\ncomputational complexity much lower than the traditional branch-and-bound\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

Expanding on this result I.M. Singer proposed that strict positivity\nof the corresponding Ricci tensor (computable through zeta function\nregularization) could play a fundamental role in establishing that the\nassociated Schroedinger operator admits a spectral gap. His argument was based\non representing the (regularized) kinetic term in the Schroedinger operator as\na Laplace-Beltrami operator on this positively curved orbit space. We revisit\nSinger's proposal and show how, when the contribution of the Yang-Mills\npotential energy is taken into account, the role of the original orbit space\nRicci tensor is instead played by a Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor computable from\nthe ground state wave functional of the quantum theory. We next review our\nongoing Euclidean-signature-semi-classical program for deriving asymptotic\nexpansions for such wave functionals and discuss how, by keeping the dynamical\nnonlinearities and non-abelian gauge invariances intact at each level of the\nanalysis, our approach surpasses that of conventional perturbation theory for\nthe generation of approximate wave functionals.

In addition, it turned\nout that the chosen surface modification renders steel S235 into an OER\nelectrocatalyst sufficiently and stable to work in neutral pH condition. Our\ninvestigation revealed that the high catalytic activities are likely to stem\nfrom the generated Fe/(Mn) hydroxide/oxo-hydroxides generated during the OER\nprocess. The phosphorization treatment is therefore not only an efficient way\nto optimize the electrocatalytic performance of standard Carbon-Manganese\nsteel, but also enables for the development of low cost and abundant steels in\nthe field of energy conversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

This preconditioning technique, together with the Krylov\nsubspace method, constitutes a novel iterative method for solving\nhyper-elastodynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\npreconditioning technique by comparing with the SIMPLE preconditioner and the\none-level domain decomposition preconditioner. Two representative examples are\nstudied: the compression of an isotropic hyperelastic cube and the tensile test\nof a fully-incompressible anisotropic hyperelastic arterial wall model. The\nrobustness with respect to material properties and the parallel performance of\nthe preconditioner are examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In particular, we expand the automata-based theory of {\\omega}-regular\nproperty verification in Markov Chains to apply it to IMCs. Any\n{\\omega}-regular property can be represented by a Deterministic Rabin Automata\n(DRA) with acceptance conditions expressed by Rabin pairs. Previous works on\nMarkov Chains have shown that computing the probability of satisfying a given\n{\\omega}-regular property reduces to a reachability problem in the product\nbetween the Markov Chain and the corresponding DRA. We similarly define the\nnotion of a product between an IMC and a DRA.

Subsequently, we prove that a\nlower bound is found by solving a reachability problem in that refined version\nof the original product IMC. We derive a similar approach for computing a\nsatisfiability upper bound in a product IMC with one Rabin pair. For product\nIMCs with more than one Rabin pair, we establish that computing a\nsatisfiability upper bound is equivalent to lower-bounding the satisfiability\nof the complement of the original property.

To study these critical battery materials and interfaces X ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a widely used technique that provides\nquantitative chemical insights. However, due to the fact that a majority of\nchemical phases relevant to battery interfaces are poor electronic conductors,\nphase identification that relies primarily on absolute XPS core level\nbinding-energies (BEs) can be problematic. Charging during XPS measurements\nleads to BE shifts that can be difficult to correct. These difficulties are\noften exacerbated by the coexistence of multiple Li containing phases in the\nSEI with overlapping XPS core levels. To facilitate accurate phase\nidentification of battery relevant phases, we propose a straightforward\napproach for removing charging effects from XPS data sets. We apply this\napproach to XPS data sets acquired from six battery relevant inorganic phases\nincluding lithium metal (Li0), lithium oxide (Li2O), lithium peroxide (Li2O2),\nlithium hydroxide (LiOH), lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), and lithium nitride\n(Li3N). Specifically, we demonstrate that BE separations between core levels\npresent in a particular phase (e.g. BE separation between the O 1s and Li 1s\ncore levels in Li2O) provide an additional constraint that can significantly\nimprove reliability of phase identification. Finally, as an exemplary case we\napply the charge-correction methodology to XPS data acquired from a symmetric\ncell based on a Li2S P2S5 solid electrolyte. This analysis demonstrates that\naccurately accounting for XPS BE shifts as a function of current-bias\nconditions can provide a direct probe of ionic conductivities associated with\nbattery materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 19:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Aims: We explore the effect of including a magnetar on the light\ncurves of supernovae with H-rich progenitors. Methods: We have applied a\nversion of our one-dimensional LTE radiation hydrodynamics code that takes into\naccount the relativistic motion of the ejecta caused by the extra energy\nprovided by the magnetar. For a fixed red supergiant (RSG) progenitor, we have\nobtained a set of light curves that corresponds to different values of the\nmagnetar initial rotation energy and the spin-down timescale.

MRI remains slow\nbecause it requires successive applications of magnetic field gradients to\nencode for spatial location. Parallel MRI accelerates imaging by permitting\nundersampling of k-space using multiple detectors, each with a unique spatial\nsensitivity to the radio field emitted by the object. This is called spatial\nsensitivity encoding. A fourfold undersampling means a fourfold acceleration,\nhowever a five-fold undersampling cannot be reconstructed. This is because too\nmuch reliance is placed on spatial sensitivity encoding, and spatial\nsensitivity encoding is less efficient than gradient encoding when the\ndetectors are large.\n  On the contrary, we hypothesized that when very large numbers of very small\ndetectors are deployed, it would render spatial sensitivity encoding efficient,\nand would allow complete elimination of gradient reversals and therefore\nextremely rapid MR imaging. Since each detector receives all of the signal from\nall of the object all of the time, signal is expected to be high, and each\ndetector is predicted to receive signal of the same order of magnitude as one\nlarge detector in conventional MRI. Moreover, the elimination of gradients\nremoves the major source of electrical noise. Unexpectedly, therefore, we\nanticipate that signal-to-noise (SNR) will be high.\n  By means of a detailed simulation, in which the exact Hertzian radio field is\nsimulated for each of 32x32x32 voxels interacting with each of 1024 detector\nloops, we demonstrate that 3-dimensional MR images can indeed be acquired very\nquickly.

Opportunistic multi-user\nscheduling is necessary to fully exploit multiplexing gains in NOMA systems,\nbut compared with traditional scheduling, interrelations between users'\nthroughputs induced by multi-user interference poses new challenges in the\ndesign of NOMA schedulers. A successful NOMA scheduler has to carefully balance\nthe following three objectives: maximizing average system utility, satisfying\ndesired fairness constraints among the users and enabling real-time, and low\ncomputational cost implementations. In this paper, scheduling for NOMA systems\nunder temporal fairness constraints is considered. Temporal fair scheduling\nleads to communication systems with predictable latency as opposed to\nutilitarian fair schedulers for which latency can be highly variable. It is\nshown that optimal system utility is achieved using a class of opportunistic\nscheduling schemes called threshold based strategies (TBS).

Such data are popularly analyzed with functional principal\ncomponent analysis via the Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation (PACE)\nmethod. The PACE method may sometimes be numerically unstable because it\ninvolves the inverse of the covariance matrix. We propose a sparse orthonormal\napproximation (SOAP) method as an alternative. It estimates the optimal\nempirical basis functions in the best approximation framework rather than\neigen-decomposing the covariance function. The SOAP method avoids estimating\nthe mean and covariance function, which is challenging when the assembled time\npoints with observations for all subjects are not sufficiently dense. The SOAP\nmethod avoids the inverse of the covariance matrix, hence the computation is\nmore stable. It does not require the functional principal component scores to\nfollow the Gaussian distribution. We show that the SOAP estimate for the\noptimal empirical basis function is asymptotically consistent.

The algorithm is based on the fact that for any layer to\nbe trained, the effect of a direct connection to an optimized linear output\nlayer can be computed without the connection being made. Thus, starting from\nthe input layer, we can train each layer in succession in isolation from the\nother layers. Once trained, the weights are kept fixed and the outputs of the\ntrained layer then serve as the inputs to the next layer to be trained. The\nresult is a very fast algorithm. The simplicity of this training arrangement\nallows the activation function and step size in weight adjustment to be\nadaptive and self-adjusting. Furthermore, the stability of the training process\nallows relatively large steps to be taken and thereby achieving in even greater\nspeeds. Finally, in our context configuring the network means determining the\nnumber of outputs for each layer.

In particular, a number of surveys have shown that near-IR brightness\nvariability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite initial understandings of\natmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous\nstudies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to\nseek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the\nthermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via large\nopacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this\nwork, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a\nself-consistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing,\ncloud radiative heating/cooling and condensation/evaporation of clouds, we show\nthat radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in\nboth temperature and cloud structure in conditions appropriate for BDs and\ndirectly imaged EGPs. The typical periods of variability are one to tens of\nhours with typical amplitude of the variability up to hundreds of Kelvins in\neffective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over a wide range\nof parameter space, but the detailed evolution of variability is sensitive to\nmodel parameters. Our novel, self-consistent mechanism has important\nimplications for the observed flux variability of BDs and directly imaged EGPs,\nespecially those evolve in short timescales.

These\nprocesses rely on phase matching among the interacting guided modes, and\nrefractive index engineering has been a primary approach for this purpose.\nUnfortunately, the modal phase matching approaches developed so far only\nproduce parametric generation with fairly low efficiencies, due to the\nintrinsic modal mismatch of spatial symmetries. Here we propose a universal\ndesign and operation principle for highly efficient optical parametric\ngeneration on integrated photonic platforms. By introducing spatial symmetry\nbreaking into the optical nonlinearity of the device, we are able to\ndramatically enhance the nonlinear parametric interaction to realize an\nextremely high efficiency. We employ this approach to design and fabricate a\nheterogeneous titanium oxide/lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide that is\nable to offer second-harmonic generation with a theoretical conversion\nefficiency as high as 2900% W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, which enables us to\nexperimentally achieve a conversion efficiency of 36.0% W$^{-1}$ in a waveguide\nonly 2.35 mm long, corresponding to a recorded normalized efficiency of 650%\nW$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ that is significantly beyond the reach of conventional modal\nphase matching approaches. Unlike nonlinearity domain engineering that is\nmaterial selective, the proposed operation principle can be flexibly applied to\nany other on-chip quadratic nonlinear platform to support ultra-highly\nefficient optical parametric interactions, thus opening up a great avenue\ntowards extreme nonlinear and quantum optics with great potentials for broad\napplications in energy efficient nonlinear and quantum photonic signal\nprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 23:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

The optimal control is the one that minimizes\nthe mismatch between the state and the desired boundary value along the\nimmersed target-domain boundary. We begin by investigating a na\\\"ive problem\nformulation that we show is ill-posed: in the case of the Laplace equation, we\nprove that the solution is unique but it fails to depend continuously on the\ndata; for the linear advection equation, even solution uniqueness fails to\nhold. These issues are addressed by two complimentary strategies. The first\nstrategy is to ensure that the enclosing domain tends to the true domain as the\nmesh is refined. The second strategy is to include a specialized parameter-free\nregularization that is based on penalizing the difference between the control\nand the state on the boundary. The proposed inverse IBM is applied to the\ndiffusion, advection, and advection-diffusion equations using a high-order\ndiscontinuous Galerkin discretization. The numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat the regularized scheme achieves optimal rates of convergence and that the\nreduced Hessian of the optimization problem has a bounded condition number as\nthe mesh is refined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 01:02:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 15:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In the symmetry-broken phase, a novel\nphonon state is developed with a dynamically-induced dipole field. We carry out\na renormalization group analysis and show that the phonon critical behavior\ndiffers wildly from any electronic system. In particular, at the critical\npoint, a single phonon mode dominates the density of states and develops an\nexotic logarithmic divergence in thermal conductivity. This phonon quantum\ncriticality provides a completely new avenue to tailor phonon transport at the\nsingle-mode level without using phononic crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 01:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

In this paper, we present a framework for enhancing the robustness\nof Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against adversarial malware samples, dubbed\nHashing Transformation Deep Neural Networks} (HashTran-DNN). The core idea is\nto use hash functions with a certain locality-preserving property to transform\nsamples to enhance the robustness of DNNs in malware classification. The\nframework further uses a Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) regularizer to\nreconstruct the hash representations of samples, making the resulting DNN\nclassifiers capable of attaining the locality information in the latent space.\nWe experiment with two concrete instantiations of the HashTran-DNN framework to\nclassify Android malware.

First, we show\nthat the discussion of fthe incidental parameters problem is based on an\nassumption about the kinds of data being studied; for what appears to be the\ncommon use of fixed effect models in political science the incidental\nparameters issue is illusory. Turning to linear models, we see that OLS yields\na linear combination of the estimates for the units with and without variation\nin the dependent variable, and so the coefficient estimates must be carefully\ninterpreted. The article then compares two methods of estimating logit models\nwith fixed effects, and shows that the Chamberlain conditional logit is as good\nas or better than a logit analysis which simply includes group specific\nintercepts (even though the conditional logit technique was designed to deal\nwith the incidental parameters problem!). Related to this, the article\ndiscusses the estimation of marginal effects using both OLS and logit. While it\nappears that a form of logit with fixed effects can be used to estimate\nmarginal effects, this method can be improved by starting with conditional\nlogit and then using the those parameter estimates to constrain the logit with\nfixed effects model. This method produces estimates of sample average marginal\neffects that are at least as good as OLS, and much better when group size is\nsmall or the number of groups is large. .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 02:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

Proof-of-Stake is an\nalternative concept that instead selects users to authorize transactions\nproportional to their wealth (`one coin, one vote'). Some aspects of the two\nparadigms are the same.

This identity is linked to basic survival\ninstincts by emotions that are mentally experienced as culture laden feelings.\nAs a consequence, individuals are motivated to cooperate with those perceived\nculturally as kin, while deviations from expected social behavior are\nexperienced as threatening to one's social identity, leading to punishment of\nthose seen as violating cultural expectations regarding socially proper\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 04:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

The BNF induction begins from a collection of neural\nunit symbols with extra (up to five) decoration fields (including tensor depth\nand sharing fields). The inductive rules provide not only the general graph\nstructure but also the specific shortcuts for residual blocks of units. A\nsyntactic mechanism for network fragments modularization is introduced via user\ndefined units and their instances. Moreover, the dual BNF rules are specified\nin order to generate the Dual Symbolic Tensor Neural Network (DSTNN). The\njoined interpretation of STNN and DSTNN provides the correct flow of gradient\ntensors, back propagated at the training stage.

The likelihood has a maximum if the calculated probability\ndistribution and the observed distribution of stars in phase space are\nconsistent. This allows us to constrain gravitational accelerations and\npotential gradient values. The method assumes that phases of stars are mixed\nwithin the regions where stellar orbits are calculated.

Within 6TiSCH, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been\nidentified as means of providing centralized control in a number of key\nsituations. However, implementing a centralized SDN architecture in a Low Power\nand Lossy Network (LLN) faces considerable challenges: not only is controller\ntraffic subject to jitter due to unreliable links and network contention, but\nthe overhead generated by SDN can severely affect the performance of other\ntraffic. This paper proposes using 6TiSCH tracks, a Layer-2 slicing mechanism\nfor creating dedicated forwarding paths across TSCH networks, in order to\nisolate the SDN control overhead. Not only does this prevent control traffic\nfrom affecting the performance of other data flows, but the properties of\n6TiSCH tracks allows deterministic, low-latency SDN controller communication.\nUsing our own lightweight SDN implementation for Contiki OS, we firstly\ndemonstrate the effect of SDN control traffic on application data flows across\na 6TiSCH network.

Protein structures are known to be\nformed of domains; structural and functional subunits that are often repeated\nacross sets of proteins. These domains generally form compact, globular\nregions, and are therefore often easily identifiable by inspection, yet the\nproblem of automatically fragmenting the protein into these compact\nsubstructures remains computationally challenging. Existing domain\nclassification methods focus on finding subregions of protein structure that\nare conserved, rather than finding a decomposition which spans the full protein\nstructure. However, such a decomposition would find ready application in\ncoarse-graining molecular dynamics, analysing the protein's topology, in de\nnovo protein design and in fitting electron microscopy maps. Here, we present a\ntool for performing this modular decomposition using the Infomap community\ndetection algorithm. The protein structure is abstracted into a network in\nwhich its amino acids are the nodes, and where the edges are generated using a\nsimple proximity test. Infomap can then be used to identify highly\nintra-connected regions of the protein. We perform this decomposition\nsystematically across 4000 distinct protein structures, taken from the Protein\nData Bank. The decomposition obtained correlates well with existing PFAM\nsequence classifications, but has the advantage of spanning the full protein,\nwith the potential for novel domains. The coarse-grained network formed by the\ncommunities can also be used as a proxy for protein topology at the\nsingle-chain level; we demonstrate that grouping these proteins by their\ncoarse-grained network results in a functionally significant classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 10:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

To reach a comprehensive understanding of both\nproperties, it is important to quantify the fractional mass of the dense gas in\nmolecular clouds f_DG. In particular, for the Milky Way (MW), there are no\nprevious studies resolving the f_DG disk over a scale of several kpc. In this\nstudy, the f_DG was measured over 5kpc in the first quadrant of the MW, based\non the CO J=1-0 data in l=10-50 deg obtained as part of the FOREST Unbiased\nGalactic Plane Imaging Survey with the Nobeyama 45-m Telescope (FUGIN) project.\nThe total molecular mass was measured using 12CO, and the dense gas mass was\nestimated using C18O. The fractional masses including f_DG in the region within\n~30% of the distances to the tangential points of the Galactic rotation (e.g.,\nthe Galactic Bar, Far-3kpc Arm, Norma Arm, Scutum Arm, Sagittarius Arm, and\ninter-arm regions) were measured. As a result, an averaged f_DG of\n2.9^{+2.6}_{-2.6} % was obtained for the entirety of the target region. This\nlow value suggests that dense gas formation is the primary factor of\ninefficient star formation in galaxies. It was also found that the f_DG shows\nlarge variations depending on the structures in the MW disk. The f_DG in the\nGalactic arms were estimated to be ~4-5%, while those in the bar and inter-arm\nregions were as small as ~0.1-0.4%.

This rollover risk consists of two components, a credit\nrisk component due to the possibility of being downgraded and thus facing a\nhigher credit spread when attempting to roll over short-term borrowing, and a\ncomponent reflecting the (systemic) possibility of being unable to roll over\nshort-term borrowing at the reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) due to an absence of\nliquidity in the market.

Aiming at identifying changes in gait\npatterns based on radar micro-Doppler signatures, this work is concerned with\nsolving the intra motion category classification problem of gait recognition.\nMethods: New gait classification approaches utilizing physical features,\nsubspace features and sum-of-harmonics modeling are presented and their\nperformances are evaluated using experimental K-band radar data of four test\nsubjects. Five different gait classes are considered for each person, including\nnormal, pathological and assisted walks. Results: The proposed approaches are\nshown to outperform existing methods for radar-based gait recognition which\nutilize physical features from the cadence-velocity data representation domain\nas in this paper. The analyzed gait classes are correctly identified with an\naverage accuracy of 93.8%, where a classification rate of 98.5% is achieved for\na single gait class. When applied to new data of another individual a\nclassification accuracy on the order of 80% can be expected.

Regardless of\nthe difficulty in obtaining a fast numerical solution, the total variation (TV)\nregularization is a preferred choice due to its edge-preserving and structure\nrecovery capabilities. While many approaches have been proposed to overcome the\nnon-differentiability of the TV cost term, an iterative shrinkage based\nformulation allows recovering an image through recursive application of linear\nfiltering and soft thresholding. However, providing an optimal setting for the\nregularization parameter is critical due to its direct impact on the rate of\nconvergence as well as steady state error. In this paper, a regularizer\nadaptively varying in the derivative space is proposed, that follows the\ngeneralized discrepancy principle (GDP). The implementation proceeds by\nadaptively reducing the discrepancy level expressed as the absolute difference\nbetween TV norms of the consistency error and the sparse approximation error. A\ncriterion based on the absolute difference between TV norms of consistency and\nsparse approximation errors is used to update the threshold. Application of the\nadaptive shrinkage TV regularizer to CS recovery of parallel MRI (pMRI) and\ntemporal gradient adaptation in dynamic MRI are shown to result in improved\nimage quality with accelerated convergence.

In the last two decades, the electric field that is\ngenerated by the activities in the brain, monitored by an electroencephalogram\n(EEG), has been proven to be a robust physiological indicator of human\nbehavior. However, mapping the human brain can be extremely challenging,\nespecially owing to the variability in human beings over time, both within and\namong individuals. Factors such as fatigue, inattention and stress can induce\nhomeostatic changes in the brain, which affect the observed relationship\nbetween brain dynamics and behavioral performance, and thus make the existing\nsystems for predicting RT difficult to generalize. To solve this problem, an\nensemble-based weighted prediction system is presented herein. This system\ncomprises a set of prediction submodels that are individually trained using\ngroups of data with similar EEG-RT relationships. To obtain a final prediction,\nthe prediction outcomes of the sub-models are then multiplied by weights that\nare derived from the EEG alpha coherences of 10 channels plus theta band powers\nof 30 channels, whose changes were found to be indicators of variations in the\nEEG-RT relationship.

Bubbles\ndiscovery in multi-genomes coloured de bruijn graph for de novo genome assembly\nis a problem that can be translated to cycles enumeration in graph theory.\nCycle enumerations algorithms in big and complex de Bruijn graphs are time\nconsuming. Specialised fast algorithms for efficient bubble search are needed\nfor coloured de bruijn graph variant calling applications. In coloured de\nBruijn graphs, bubble paths coverages are used in downstream variants calling\nanalysis. Results: In this paper, we introduce a fast parallel graph search for\ndifferent K-mer cycle sizes. Coloured path coverages are used for SNP\nprediction. The graph search method uses a combined multi-node and multi-core\ndesign to speeds up cycles enumeration. The search algorithm uses an index\nextracted from the raw assembly of a coloured de Bruijn graph stored in a hash\ntable. The index is distributed across different CPU-cores, in a shared memory\nHPC compute node, to build undirected subgraphs then search independently and\nsimultaneously specific cycle sizes. This same index can also be split between\nseveral HPC compute nodes to take advantage of as many CPU-cores available to\nthe user. The local neighbourhood parallel search approach reduces the graph's\ncomplexity and facilitate cycles search of a multi-colour de Bruijn graph.

Rotation forest is a tree based ensemble that performs transforms\non subsets of attributes prior to constructing each tree.

We evaluate classifiers from three families of algorithms: support\nvector machines; tree-based ensembles; and neural networks tuned with a large\ngrid search. We compare classifiers on unseen data based on the quality of the\ndecision rule (using classification error) the ability to rank cases (area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic) and the probability estimates\n(using negative log likelihood). We conclude that, in answer to the question\nposed in the title, yes, rotation forest is significantly more accurate on\naverage than competing techniques when compared on three distinct sets of\ndatasets. Further, we assess the impact of the design features of rotation\nforest through an ablative study that transforms random forest into rotation\nforest.

It is easy to see that $L = \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^k v_i$ for some\nefficiency $\\alpha \\in [\\frac{1}{2},1)$.

However, creating safe,\ndynamically-feasible trajectories in real time is challenging; and, planners\nmust ensure persistent feasibility, meaning a new trajectory is always\navailable before the previous one has finished executing. Existing approaches\nmake a tradeoff between model complexity and planning speed, which can require\nsacrificing guarantees of safety and dynamic feasibility. This work presents\nthe Reachability-based Trajectory Design (RTD) method for trajectory planning.\nRTD begins with an offline Forward Reachable Set (FRS) computation of a robot's\nmotion when tracking parameterized trajectories; the FRS provably bounds\ntracking error. At runtime, the FRS is used to map obstacles to parameterized\ntrajectories, allowing RTD to select a safe trajectory at every planning\niteration. RTD prescribes an obstacle representation to ensure that obstacle\nconstraints can be created and evaluated in real time while maintaining safety.\nPersistent feasibility is achieved by prescribing a minimum sensor horizon and\na minimum duration for the planned trajectories. A system decomposition\napproach is used to improve the tractability of computing the FRS, allowing RTD\nto create more complex plans at runtime. RTD is compared in simulation with\nRapidly-Exploring Random Trees and Nonlinear Model-Predictive Control.

Employing local gate\ncontrol, several examples of electronic devices based on Dirac fermion dynamics\nhave been demonstrated, including Klein tunneling, negative refraction and\nspecular Andreev reflection. In this work, we present a quantum switch based on\nanalogous Dirac-fermion-optics (DFO), in which the angle dependence of Klein\ntunneling is explicitly utilized to build tunable collimators and reflectors\nfor the quantum wave function of Dirac fermions. We employ a novel dual-source\ndesign with a single flat reflector, which minimizes diffusive edge scattering\nand suppresses the background incoherent transmission. Our gate-tunable\ncollimator-reflector device design enables measurement of the net DFO\ncontribution in the switching device operation. We measure a full set of\ntransmission coefficients of DFO wavefunction between multiple leads of the\ndevice, separating the classical contribution from that of any disorder in the\nchannel. Since the DFO quantum switch demonstrated in this work requires no\nexplicit energy gap, the switching operation is expected to be robust against\nthermal fluctuations and inhomogeneity length scales comparable to the Fermi\nwavelength. We find our quantum switch works at an elevated temperature up to\n230 K and large bias current density up to 102 A/m, over a wide range of\ncarrier densities.

Existing samplers\nbased on MCMC or sequential importance sampling are generally not scalable;\ntheir efficiency degrades in sparse graphs. MCMC methods usually require\nexplicit computation of a Markov basis to navigate the complex state space;\nthis is computationally intensive even for small graphs. We use state-dependent\nkernel selection to develop new MCMC samplers. These do not require a Markov\nbasis, and are efficient both in sparse and dense graphs. The key idea is to\nintelligently select a Markov kernel on the basis of the current state of the\nchain. We apply our methods to testing hypotheses on a real network and\ncontingency table.

We present a general framework for understanding the signatures of\nionospheric behaviour in the two-dimensional (2D) neutral hydrogen power\nspectrum measured by a low-frequency radio interferometer. Two primary classes\nof ionospheric behaviour are considered, corresponding to dominant modes\nobserved in Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) EoR data; namely, anisotropic\nstructured wave behaviour, and isotropic turbulence. Analytic predictions for\npower spectrum bias due to this contamination are computed, and compared with\nsimulations. We then apply the ionospheric metric described in Jordan et al.\n(2017) to study the impact of ionospheric structure on MWA data, by dividing\nMWA EoR datasets into classes with good and poor ionospheric conditions, using\nsets of matched 30-minute observations from 2014 September. The results are\ncompared with the analytic and simulated predictions, demonstrating the\nobserved bias in the power spectrum when the ionosphere is active (displays\ncoherent structures or isotropic turbulence). The analysis demonstrates that\nunless ionospheric activity can be quantified and corrected, active data should\nnot be included in EoR analysis in order to avoid systematic biases in\ncosmological power spectra.

Based on the time accurate high-order gas-kinetic\nevolution solution at a cell interface, the time dependent gas distribution\nfunction in GKS provides not only the flux function and its time derivative at\na cell interface, but also the time accurate flow variables there at next time\nlevel. As a result, besides updating the conservative flow variables inside\neach control volume through the interface fluxes, the cell averaged first-order\nspatial derivatives of flow variables in the cell can be also obtained using\nthe updated flow variables at the cell interfaces around that cell through the\ndivergence theorem.\n  Therefore, with the flow variables and their first-order spatial derivatives\ninside each cell, the Hermite WENO (HWENO) techniques can be naturally\nimplemented for the compact high-order reconstruction at the beginning of a new\ntime step.\n  Following the reconstruction method in (Zhu et al. 2018), a new HWENO\nreconstruction on triangular meshes is designed in the current scheme. Combined\nwith a two-stage temporal discretization and second-order gas-kinetic flux\nfunction, a third-order spatial and temporal accuracy in the current compact\nscheme can be achieved.

Earlier studies have probed individual factors but an\nintegrated picture to reveal quantifiable actions has been missing. There is a\ngrowing concern about a further widening of healthcare inequality caused by\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) due to differential access to AI-driven services.\nHence, it is imperative to explore and exploit the potential of AI for\nilluminating biases and enabling transparent policy decisions for positive\nsocial and health impact. In this work, we reveal actionable interventions for\ndecreasing the longevity-gap in the United States by analyzing a County-level\ndata resource containing healthcare, socio-economic, behavioral, education and\ndemographic features. We learn an ensemble-averaged structure, draw inferences\nusing the joint probability distribution and extend it to a Bayesian Decision\nNetwork for identifying policy actions. We draw quantitative estimates for the\nimpact of diversity, preventive-care quality and stable-families within the\nunified framework of our decision network. Finally, we make this analysis and\ndashboard available as an interactive web-application for enabling users and\npolicy-makers to validate our reported findings and to explore the impact of\nones beyond reported in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 00:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2018 04:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

When the two fluids are miscible, the surface\ntension at their contact front vanishes, leaving the variation in viscosity\ndominant the contribution to the instability. The phenomena, named viscous\nfingering, can be studied by the analogy of a single-phase flow in the\nHele-Shaw cell, a quasi-two-dimensional rectilinear plane. Viscous fingering\nproduces complex geometrical patterns. They are important not only in industry\nbut also in mathematics. Theoretical analyses on the evolution of the\nfinger-like patterns in miscible fluids are still expanding (it is referred to\nthe morphology of the flow patterns). Here we study the morphology of the\nfinger-like patterns within some simple concepts in differential geometry, in\nwhich surfaces and curves are analog to the profiles of the concentration and\nits contours, respectively. We thus can investigate the fingering phenomena\nthrough the geometrical perspective in which various results in differential\ngeometry are immediately applicable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 05:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

One major challenge for clinical adoption, however, is the steep\nlearning curve clinicians need to overcome to interpret OCM images. Developing\nan intelligent technique for computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) to accurately\ninterpret OCM images will facilitate clinical adoption of the technology and\nimprove patient care. Methods: 497 high-resolution 3-D OCM volumes (600\ncross-sectional images each) were collected from 159 ex vivo specimens of 92\nfemale patients. OCM image features were extracted using a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) model, concatenated with patient information (e.g., age, HPV\nresults), and classified using a support vector machine classifier. Ten-fold\ncross-validations were utilized to test the performance of the CADx method in a\nfive-class classification task and a binary classification task. Results: An\n88.3 plus or minus 4.9% classification accuracy was achieved for five\nfine-grained classes of cervical tissue, namely normal, ectropion, low-grade\nand high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL), and cancer. In\nthe binary classification task (low-risk [normal, ectropion and LSIL] vs.\nhigh-risk [HSIL and cancer]), the CADx method achieved an area-under-the-curve\n(AUC) value of 0.959 with an 86.7 plus or minus 11.4% sensitivity and 93.5 plus\nor minus 3.8% specificity. Conclusion: The proposed deep-learning based CADx\nmethod outperformed three human experts. It was also able to identify\nmorphological characteristics in OCM images that were consistent with\nhistopathological interpretations. Significance: Label-free OCM imaging,\ncombined with deep-learning based CADx methods, hold a great promise to be used\nin clinical settings for the effective screening and diagnosis of cervical\ndiseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

The dynamics of the pair of rotors,\nmodeled as rotlets, are non Hamiltonian in the bounded domain and produce\nchaotic advection of fluid tracers in subsets of the domain. A complete\nparametric investigation of the fluid mixing as a function of the initial\nlocations of the rotlets is performed based on pseudo phase portraits. The\nmixing of fluid tracers as a function of relative positions of micro-rotors is\nstudied using finite time entropy and locational entropy. The finite time\nlocational entropy is used to identify regions of the fluid that produce good\nvs poor mixing and this is visualized by the stretching and folding of blobs of\ntracer particles. Unlike the case of the classic blinking vortex dynamics, the\nvelocity field of the flow modeled using rotlets inside a circular boundary is\nsmooth in time and satisfies the no slip boundary condition.

Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) are\nexpected to prevent road accidents and save millions of lives while improving\nthe livelihood and life quality of many more. However, despite large interest\nand a number of industry players working in the autonomous domain, there still\nremains more to be done in order to develop a system capable of operating at a\nlevel comparable to best human drivers. One reason for this is high uncertainty\nof traffic behavior and large number of situations that an SDV may encounter on\nthe roads, making it very difficult to create a fully generalizable system. To\nensure safe and efficient operations, an autonomous vehicle is required to\naccount for this uncertainty and to anticipate a multitude of possible\nbehaviors of traffic actors in its surrounding. We address this critical\nproblem and present a method to predict multiple possible trajectories of\nactors while also estimating their probabilities. The method encodes each\nactor's surrounding context into a raster image, used as input by deep\nconvolutional networks to automatically derive relevant features for the task.\nFollowing extensive offline evaluation and comparison to state-of-the-art\nbaselines, the method was successfully tested on SDVs in closed-course tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 04:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 14:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

In this paper we build on this work to show that this\napproach allows us, for the first time, to separate the effects of random\nexperimental noise and inherent system variability in voltammetric experiments.\nWe analyse ten repeated experimental data sets for the $[$Fe(CN)$_6]^{3-/ 4-}$\nprocess, again using large-amplitude ac cyclic voltammetry. In each of the ten\ncases we are able to obtain an extremely good fit to the experimental data and\nobtain very narrow distributions of the recovered parameters governing both the\nfaradaic (the reversible formal faradaic potential, $E_0$, the standard\nheterogeneous charge transfer rate constant $k_0$, and the charge transfer\ncoefficient $\\alpha$) and non-faradaic terms (uncompensated resistance, $R_u$,\nand double layer capacitance, $C_{dl}$). We then employ hierarchical Bayesian\nmethods to recover the underlying \"hyperdistribution\" of the faradaic and\nnon-faradaic parameters, showing that in general the variation between the\nexperimental data sets is significantly greater than suggested by individual\nexperiments, except for $\\alpha$ where the inter-experiment variation was\nrelatively minor. Correlations between pairs of parameters are provided, and\nfor example, reveal a weak link between $k_0$ and $C_{dl}$ (surface activity of\na glassy carbon electrode surface).
