Giant impacts are expected to play a role in the\nformation of many of these worlds. Previous works, focused on the mechanical\nshock caused by a giant impact, have shown that these impacts can eject large\nfractions of the planetary envelope, offering a partial explanation for the\nobserved spread in exoplanet compositions. Here, we examine the thermal\nconsequences of giant impacts, and show that the atmospheric loss caused by\nthese effects can significantly exceed that caused by mechanical shocks for\nhydrogen-helium (H/He) envelopes. When a giant impact occurs, part of the\nimpact energy is converted into thermal energy, heating the rocky core and the\nenvelope. We find that the ensuing thermal expansion of the envelope can lead\nto a period of sustained, rapid mass loss through a Parker wind, resulting in\nthe partial or complete erosion of the H/He envelope. The fraction of the\nenvelope lost depends on the planet's orbital distance from its host star and\nits initial thermal state, and hence age. Planets closer to their host stars\nare more susceptible to thermal atmospheric loss triggered by impacts than ones\non wider orbits. Similarly, younger planets, with rocky cores which are still\nhot and molten from formation, suffer greater atmospheric loss. This is\nespecially interesting because giant impacts are expected to occur\n$10{-}100~\\mathrm{Myr}$ after formation. For planets where the thermal energy\nof the core is much greater than the envelope energy, the impactor mass\nrequired for significant atmospheric removal is $M_\\mathrm{imp} / M_p \\sim \\mu\n/ \\mu_c \\sim 0.1$, approximately the ratio of the heat capacities of the\nenvelope and core. When the envelope energy dominates the total energy budget,\ncomplete loss can occur when the impactor mass is comparable to the envelope\nmass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Past strategies to address this challenge have considered model\nadaptation, accent classification with a model selection, alternate\npronunciation lexicon, etc. In this study, we consider a recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) cost function\ntrained on multi-accent English data including US (Native), Indian and Hispanic\naccents. We exploit dark knowledge from a model trained with the multi-accent\ndata to train student models under the guidance of both a teacher model and CTC\ncost of target transcription. We show that transferring knowledge from a single\nRNN-CTC trained model toward a student model, yields better performance than\nthe stand-alone teacher model. Since the outputs of different trained CTC\nmodels are not necessarily aligned, it is not possible to simply use an\nensemble of CTC teacher models. To address this problem, we train accent\nspecific models under the guidance of a single multi-accent teacher, which\nresults in having multiple aligned and trained CTC models. Furthermore, we\ntrain a student model under the supervision of the accent-specific teachers,\nresulting in an even further complementary model, which achieves +20.1%\nrelative Character Error Rate (CER) reduction compared to the baseline trained\nwithout any teacher. Having this effective multi-accent model, we can achieve\nfurther improvement for each accent by adapting the model to each accent. Using\nthe accent specific model's outputs to regularize the adapting process (i.e., a\nknowledge distillation version of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence) results in\neven superior performance compared to the conventional approach using general\nteacher models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 18:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}

We utilize a physically motivated analytic\ntwo-parameter model called the \"boosted fireball\" for the outflow structure\nafter it has expanded far from the merger site and has entered the self-similar\ncoasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows with a structure\nvarying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an\nisotropic fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with \"boosted\nfireball\" initial conditions, of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh\nrelativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution through the\nafterglow phase.

Complex data analysis programs in areas such as machine\nlearning and graph analytics often involve control flow, i.e., iterations and\nbranching. Therefore, systems for advanced analytics should include control\nflow constructs that are efficient and easy to use. A natural approach is to\nprovide imperative control flow constructs similar to those of mainstream\nprogramming languages: while-loops, if-statements, and mutable variables, whose\nvalues can change between iteration steps.\n  However, current parallel dataflow systems execute programs written using\nimperative control flow constructs by launching a separate dataflow job after\nevery control flow decision (e.g., for every step of a loop). The performance\nof this approach is suboptimal, because (a) launching a dataflow job incurs\nscheduling overhead; and (b) it prevents certain optimizations across iteration\nsteps.\n  In this paper, we introduce Labyrinth, a method to compile programs written\nusing imperative control flow constructs to a single dataflow job, which\nexecutes the whole program, including all iteration steps. This way, we achieve\nboth efficiency and ease of use. We also conduct an experimental evaluation,\nwhich shows that Labyrinth has orders of magnitude smaller per-iteration-step\noverhead than launching new dataflow jobs, and also allows for significant\noptimizations across iteration steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 16:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 13:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

In one\ndimension, these are zero-energy modes bound to the ends, while in two\ndimensions these are chiral gapless modes traveling along the edge. Majorana\nmodes have attracted a lot of interest due to their exotic properties, which\ninclude non-abelian exchange statistics. Progress in realizing topological\nsuperconductivity has been made by combining spin-orbit coupling, conventional\nsuperconductivity, and magnetism. The existence of protected Majorana modes,\nhowever, does not inherently require the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by\nmagnetic fields. Indeed, pairs of Majorana modes can reside at the boundary of\na \\emph{time-reversal-invariant} topological superconductor (TRITOPS). It is\nthe time-reversal symmetry which then protects this so-called Majorana Kramers'\npair from gapping out. This is analogous to the case of the two-dimensional\ntopological insulator, with its pair of helical gapless boundary modes,\nprotected by time-reversal symmetry. Realizing the TRITOPS phase will be a\nmajor step in the study of topological phases of matter. In this paper we\ndescribe the physical properties of the TRITOPS phase, and review recent\nproposals for engineering and detecting them in condensed matter systems, in\none and two spatial dimensions.

These analytical solutions provide simple\ninterpretations to the numerical results, can be employed to test the\ncomputational codes, and can be used for fast a computation of the abundance of\ndistant sources and arcs. In this paper, the lens is modeled by a Singular\nIsothermal Sphere, which is an excellent approximation to radial density\nprofile of Early-Type galaxies, and the sources are also axisymmetric. We\nderive expressions for the geometrical properties of the images, such as the\narea and several definitions of length and width. We obtain the magnification\ncross section in exact form and derive a simple analytic approximation covering\nthe arc and Einstein ring regimes. The arc cross section is obtained down to\nthe formation of an Einstein ring and given in terms of elementary functions.\nPerturbative expansions of these results are worked out, showing explicitly the\ncorrection terms for finite sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

The modal coupling introduces several new creation\npathways to a nonlinear optical process within the device, which quantum\nmechanically interfere to drive the system between states in the time domain.\nThe coherent conversion entangles the generated biphoton states between\npropagation pathways, leading to cyclically evolving path-entanglement and the\nmanifestation of coherent oscillations in second-order temporal correlations.\nFurthermore, the rich device physics is harnessed to tune properties of the\nquantum states.

In order to use SFT,\none has to assume the speed to process each feature is influenced by that\nfeature only, termed as selective influence (Sternberg, 1969). This assumption\nis usually untestable as the processing time for a stimulus feature is not\nobservable. Stochastic dominance is traditionally used as an indirect evidence\nfor selective influence (e.g., Townsend & Fifi\\'c, 2004). However, one should\nkeep in mind that selective influence may be violated even when stochastic\ndominance holds. The current study proposes a trackball movement paradigm for a\ndirect test of selective influence. The participants were shown a reference\nstimulus and a test stimulus simultaneously on a computer screen. They were\nasked to use the trackball to adjust the test stimulus until it appeared to\nmatch the position or shape of the reference stimulus. We recorded the reaction\ntime, the parameters defined the reference stimulus (denoted as \\alpha and\n\\beta ), and the parameters defined the test stimulus (denoted as A and B).

Phenomenological models\nexplain these properties by postulating an underlying defect structure in these\nmaterials but do not detail the microscopic properties of these defects. Using\nmachine learning methods, we identify mesoscale defects that lead to shear\nbanding in polymer nanopillars well below the glass transition temperature as a\nfunction of pillar diameter. Our results show that the primary structural\nfeatures responsible for shear banding on this scale are fluctuations in the\ndiameter of the pillar. Surprisingly, these fluctuations are quite small\ncompared to the diameter of the pillar, less than half of a particle diameter\nin size. At intermediate pillar diameters, we find that these fluctuations tend\nto concentrate along the minor axis of shear band planes. We also see the\nimportance of mean softness as a classifier of shear banding grow as a function\nof pillar diameter. Softness is a new field that characterizes local structure\nand is highly correlated with particle-level dynamics such that softer\nparticles are more likely to rearrange. This demonstrates that softness, a\nquantity that relates particle-level structure to dynamics on short time and\nlength scales, can predict large time and length scale phenomena related to\nmaterial failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 20:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

This paper reviews the 5G security\narchitecture, requirements and main processes and evaluates them in the context\nof known and new protocol exploits. Although the security has been enhanced\nwhen compared to previous generations to tackle known protocol exploits, our\nanalysis identifies some potentially unrealistic system assumptions that are\ncritical for security as well as a number protocol edge cases that could render\n5G systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For example, null encryption and\nnull authentication are supported and can be used in valid system\nconfigurations, and certain key security functions are still left outside of\nthe scope of the specifications. Moreover, the prevention of pre-authentcation\nmessage exploits appears to rely on the implicit assumption of impractical\ncarrier and roaming agreements and the management of public keys from all\nglobal operators. In parallel, existing threats such as International Mobile\nSubscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers are prevented only if the serving network\nenforces optional security features and if the UE knows the public key of the\nhome network operator. The comparison with 4G LTE protocol exploits reveals\nthat the 5G security specifications, as of Release 15, do not fully address the\nuser privacy and network availability concerns, where one edge case can\ncompromise the privacy, security and availability of 5G users and services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 20:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 13:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 15:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 22:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

Major protein contributors to chromosome structure and dynamics are\ncondensin and cohesin that stochastically generate loops within and between\nchains, and entrap proximal strands of sister chromatids. In this paper, we\nexplore the ability of transient, protein-mediated, gene-gene crosslinks to\ninduce clusters of genes, thereby dynamic architecture, within the highly\nrepeated ribosomal DNA that comprises the nucleolus of budding yeast. We\nimplement three approaches: live cell microscopy; computational modeling of the\nfull genome during G1 in budding yeast, exploring four decades of timescales\nfor transient crosslinks between 5k bp domains in the nucleolus on Chromosome\nXII; and, temporal network models with automated community detection algorithms\napplied to the full range of 4D modeling datasets. The data analysis tools\ndetect and track gene clusters, their size, number, persistence time, and their\nplasticity. Of biological significance, our analysis reveals an optimal mean\ncrosslink lifetime that promotes pairwise and cluster gene interactions through\n\"flexible\" clustering. In this state, large gene clusters self-assemble yet\nfrequently interact, marked by gene exchanges between clusters, which in turn\nmaximizes global gene interactions in the nucleolus. This regime stands between\ntwo limiting cases each with far less global gene interactions: with shorter\ncrosslink lifetimes, \"rigid\" clustering emerges with clusters that interact\ninfrequently; with longer crosslink lifetimes, there is a dissolution of\nclusters. These observations are compared with imaging experiments on a normal\nyeast strain and two condensin-modified mutant cell strains, applying the same\nimage analysis pipeline to the experimental and simulated datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 20:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 15:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 19:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The critical temperature corresponding to the vacuum\nto nuclear medium phase transition is observed to decrease with the external\nmagnetic field which can be identified as the inverse magnetic catalysis in\nWalecka model whereas the opposite behaviour is obtained in case of vanishing\nmagnetic moment indicating magnetic catalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 07:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Predis combines perturbation encryption and data\nencryption to protect privacy and employs a computationally simple and\nefficient algorithm k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) as its detection algorithm. We\nalso improve kNN to achieve better efficiency. Via theoretical analysis and\nextensive simulations, we demonstrate that Predis is capable of achieving\nefficient and accurate attack detection while securing sensitive information of\neach domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 07:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

We introduce two new methods to achieve this, the first method\ninvolving two new versions of convex-split lemma that use small amount of\nadditional resource (in comparison to prior version) and the second method\nbeing inspired by the technique of classical correlated sampling in computer\nscience. These lead to a series of new consequences, as follows.\n  First, we consider the task of quantum decoupling, where the aim is to apply\nan operation on a n-qubit register so as to make it independent of an\ninaccessible quantum system. Many previous works achieve decoupling with the\naid of a random unitary. It is known that random unitaries can be replaced by\nrandom circuits of size O(n\\log n) and depth poly(\\log n), or unitary 2-designs\nbased on Clifford circuits of similar size and depth. We show that given any\nchoice of basis such as the computational basis, decoupling can be achieved by\na unitary that takes basis vectors to basis vectors. Thus, the circuit acts in\na `classical' manner and additionally uses O(n) catalytic qubits in maximally\nmixed quantum state. Our unitary performs addition and multiplication modulo a\nprime and hence achieves a circuit size of O(n\\log n) and logarithmic depth.\nThis shows that the circuit complexity of integer multiplication (modulo a\nprime) is lower bounded by the optimal circuit complexity of decoupling.\n  Next, we construct a new one-shot entanglement-assisted protocol for quantum\nchannel coding that achieves near-optimal communication through a given\nchannel. The number of qubits of pre-shared entanglement is exponentially\nsmaller than that in the previous protocol near-optimal in communication.

The principle is to\nexcite a body to reconstruct with a pulse inducing an inhomogeneous heating and\ntherefore expansion of tissues.

The reconstruction of heterogeneities inside the body\ncan be then performed by solving an inverse problem, knowing measurements of\nthe acoustic waves outside the body. As the intensity of the measured pressure\nis expected to be small, a challenging problem consists in locating the sensors\nin a adequate way. This paper is devoted to the determination of an optimal\nsensors location to achieve this reconstruction. We first introduce a model\ninvolving a least square functional standing for an observation of the pressure\nfor a first series of measures by sensors, and an observability-like constant\nfunctional describing for the quality of reconstruction.

Owing to the success of deep neural networks in representation\nlearning, recent advance on multimedia recommendation has largely focused on\nexploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy. To\ndate, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of\nmultimedia representation and its impact on the performance of multimedia\nrecommendation.\n  In this paper, we shed light on the robustness of multimedia recommender\nsystem. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework and deep image\nfeatures, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a\nsmall (but purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease\nthe recommendation accuracy. This implies the possible weakness of multimedia\nrecommender system in predicting user preference, and more importantly, the\npotential of improvement by enhancing its robustness. To this end, we propose a\nnovel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can\nlead to a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial\nlearning. The idea is to train the model to defend an adversary, which adds\nperturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing the model's\naccuracy. We conduct experiments on two representative multimedia\nrecommendation tasks, namely, image recommendation and visually-aware product\nrecommendation. Extensive results verify the positive effect of adversarial\nlearning and demonstrate the effectiveness of our AMR method.

Three main types of measurement error in continuous\nendpoints are considered: classical, systematic and differential. For each\nmeasurement error type, a corrected effect estimator is proposed. The corrected\nestimators and several methods for confidence interval estimation are tested in\na simulation study. These methods combine information about error-prone and\nerror-free measurements of the endpoint in individuals not included in the\ntrial (external calibration sample). We show that if measurement error in\ncontinuous endpoints is ignored, the treatment effect estimator is unbiased\nwhen measurement error is classical, while Type-II error is increased at a\ngiven sample size. Conversely, the estimator can be substantially biased when\nmeasurement error is systematic or differential. In those cases, bias can\nlargely be prevented and inferences improved upon using information from an\nexternal calibration sample, of which the required sample size increases as the\nstrength of the association between the error-prone and error-free endpoint\ndecreases. Measurement error correction using already a small (external)\ncalibration sample is shown to improve inferences and should be considered in\ntrials with error-prone endpoints.

However, this\nfact does not imply that NOMA is the most efficient way to communicate in\nmassive MIMO setups, where the base stations have many more antennas than there\nare users in the cell.

Although most Modula-2\ncompilers of that era have disappeared, a few have since been re-released under\nopen source licenses. Whilst the original authors have long ceased work on\nthese compilers, new maintainers have stepped in. This paper gives\nrecommendations for maintenance on classic Modula-2 compilers while balancing\nthe aim to modernise with the need to maintain the capability to compile\nprogramming examples in the literature with minimal effort. Nevertheless, the\nprinciples, methods and conclusions presented are adaptable to maintenance on\nother languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 09:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

However, most deep\nlearning methods employ feed-forward architectures, and thus the dependencies\nbetween LR and HR images are not fully exploited, leading to limited learning\nperformance. Moreover, most deep learning based SR methods apply the pixel-wise\nreconstruction error as the loss, which, however, may fail to capture\nhigh-frequency information and produce perceptually unsatisfying results,\nwhilst the recent perceptual loss relies on some pre-trained deep model and\nthey may not generalize well.

An oft-encountered problem in computational finance is the\nchoice of an appropriate epoch over which the empirical cross-correlation\nreturn matrix is computed. A long epoch would smoothen the fluctuations in the\nreturn time series and suffers from non-stationarity, whereas a short epoch\nresults in noisy fluctuations in the return time series and the correlation\nmatrices turn out to be highly singular. An effective method to tackle this\nissue is the use of the power mapping, where a non-linear distortion is applied\nto a short epoch correlation matrix. The value of distortion parameter controls\nthe noise-suppression. The distortion also removes the degeneracy of zero\neigenvalues. Depending on the correlation structures, interesting properties of\nthe eigenvalue spectra are found.

A collider for a certain pair of variables (e.g., an outcome Y\nand an exposure A) is a third variable (C) that is caused by both. In a\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG), a collider is the variable in the middle of an\ninverted fork (i.e., the variable C in A -> C <- Y). Controlling for, or\nconditioning an analysis on a collider (i.e., through stratification or\nregression) can introduce a spurious association between its causes. This\npotentially explains many paradoxical findings in the medical literature, where\nestablished risk factors for a particular outcome appear protective. We use an\nexample from non-communicable disease epidemiology to contextualize and explain\nthe effect of conditioning on a collider.

Moreover, optimization algorithms which take path norm as\nthe regularization term to the loss function, like Path-SGD, have been shown to\nachieve better generalization performance. However, the path norm counts the\nvalues of all paths, and hence the capacity measure based on path norm could be\nimproperly influenced by the dependency among different paths.

The problem is a generalization of\nthe classical Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) on points and has been widely\nstudied in the literature. For the case of disjoint uniform disks of radius\n$R$, Dumitrescu and Mitchell[2001] show that the optimal TSP tour on the\ncenters of the disks is a $3.547$-approximation to the TSPN version. The core\nof their analysis is based on bounding the detour that the optimal TSPN tour\nhas to make in order to visit the centers of each disk and shows that it is at\nmost $2Rn$ in the worst case. H\\\"{a}me, Hyyti\\\"{a} and Hakula[2011] asked\nwhether this bound is tight when $R$ is small and conjectured that it is at\nmost $\\sqrt{3}Rn$.\n  We further investigate this question and derive structural properties of the\noptimal TSPN tour to describe the cases in which the bound is smaller than\n$2Rn$. Specifically, we show that if the optimal TSPN tour is not a straight\nline, at least one of the following is guaranteed to be true: the bound is\nsmaller than $1.999Rn$ or the $TSP$ on the centers is a $2$-approximation. The\nlatter bound of $2$ is the best that we can get in general. Our framework is\nbased on using the optimality of the TSPN tour to identify local structures for\nwhich the detour is large and then using their geometry to derive better lower\nbounds on the length of the TSPN tour. This leads to an improved approximation\nfactor of $3.53$ for disjoint uniform disks and $6.728$ for the general case.\nWe further show that the H\\\"{a}me, Hyyti\\\"{a} and Hakula conjecture is true for\nthe case of three disks and discuss the method used to obtain it. Along the\nway, we will uncover one way in which the TSPN problem is structurally\ndifferent from the classical TSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 13:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

Traditionally, the innovation noise of the AR is modeled as\nGaussian. However, many time series applications, for example, financial time\nseries data, are non-Gaussian, therefore, the AR model with more general\nheavy-tailed innovations is preferred. Another issue that frequently occurs in\ntime series is missing values, due to system data record failure or unexpected\ndata loss. Although there are numerous works about Gaussian AR time series with\nmissing values, as far as we know, there does not exist any work addressing the\nissue of missing data for the heavy-tailed AR model. In this paper, we consider\nthis issue for the first time, and propose an efficient framework for parameter\nestimation from incomplete heavy-tailed time series based on a stochastic\napproximation expectation maximization (SAEM) coupled with a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) procedure. The proposed algorithm is computationally cheap and\neasy to implement. The convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary\npoint of the observed data likelihood is rigorously proved. Extensive\nsimulations and real datasets analyses demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 14:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2019 08:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The\npresent approach partitions the flow trajectories (force measurements) into\nclusters, which correspond to characteristic coarse-grained phases in a\nlow-dimensional feature space. A feedback control law is then sought for each\ncluster state through iterative evaluation and downhill simplex search to\nminimize power consumption in flight. Unsupervised clustering of the flow\ntrajectories for in-situ learning and optimization of coarse-grained control\nlaws are implemented in an automated manner as key enablers. Re-routing the\nflow trajectories, the optimized control laws shift the cluster populations to\nthe aerodynamically favorable states. Utilizing limited number of sensor\nmeasurements for both clustering and optimization, these feedback laws were\ndetermined in only $O(10)$ iterations. The objective of the present work is not\nnecessarily to suppress flow separation but to minimize the desired cost\nfunction to achieve enhanced aerodynamic performance.

It\nfurther considers whether a Willis-type constitutive matrix (in temporal and\nspatial Fourier domain) may reproduce the scattering matrix (SM) of such a\nsystem. In answering this question the procedure to determine the relevant\noverall constitutive parameters for such a medium is presented. To do this,\nfirst the general form of the dispersion relation and impedances for oblique SH\npropagation in such coupled Willis-type media are developed. The band structure\nand scattering of layered media are calculated using the transfer matrix (TM)\nmethod. The dispersion relation may be derived based on the eigensolutions of\nan infinite periodic domain. The wave impedances associated with the exterior\nsurfaces of a finite thickness slab are extracted from the scattering of such a\nsystem. Based on reciprocity and available symmetries of the structure and each\nconstituent layer, the general form of the dispersion and impedances may be\nsimplified. The overall quantities may be extracted by equating the scattering\ndata from TM with those expected from a Willis-type medium. It becomes evident\nthat a Willis-type coupled constitutive tensor with components that are assumed\nindependent of wave vector is unable to reproduce all oblique scattering data.\nTherefore, non-unique wave vector dependent formulations are introduced, whose\nSM matches that of the layered media exactly. It is further shown that the\ndependence of the overall constitutive tensors of such systems on the wave\nvector is not removable even at very small frequencies and incidence angles and\nthat analytical considerations significantly limit the potential forms of the\nspatially dispersive constitutive tensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 15:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

However, two issues hinder reliable on-board monocular vision\nbased pose estimation: robustness to illumination conditions due to a lack of\nreliable visual features and scarcity of image datasets required for training\nand benchmarking. To address these two issues, this work details the design and\nvalidation of a monocular vision based pose determination architecture for\nspaceborne applications. The primary contribution to the state-of-the-art of\nthis work is the introduction of a novel pose determination method based on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to provide an initial guess of the pose in\nreal-time on-board. The method involves discretizing the pose space and\ntraining the CNN with images corresponding to the resulting pose labels. Since\nreliable training of the CNN requires massive image datasets and computational\nresources, the parameters of the CNN must be determined prior to the mission\nwith synthetic imagery. Moreover, reliable training of the CNN requires\ndatasets that appropriately account for noise, color, and illumination\ncharacteristics expected in orbit. Therefore, the secondary contribution of\nthis work is the introduction of an image synthesis pipeline, which is tailored\nto generate high fidelity images of any spacecraft 3D model. The proposed\ntechnique is scalable to spacecraft of different structural and physical\nproperties as well as robust to the dynamic illumination conditions of space.\nThrough metrics measuring classification and pose accuracy, it is shown that\nthe presented architecture has desirable robustness and scalable properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 15:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

To solve CC-OPF,\nwe often need access to the (true) joint probability distribution of all\nuncertainties, which is rarely known in practice. A solution based on a biased\nestimate of the distribution can result in poor reliability. To overcome this\nchallenge, recent work has explored distributionally robust chance constraints,\nin which the chance constraints are satisfied over a family of distributions\ncalled the ambiguity set. Commonly, ambiguity sets are only based on moment\ninformation (e.g., mean and covariance) of the random variables; however,\nspecifying additional characteristics of the random variables reduces\nconservatism and cost. Here, we consider ambiguity sets that additionally\nincorporate unimodality information. In practice, it is difficult to estimate\nthe mode location from the data and so we allow it to be potentially\nmisspecified. We formulate the problem and derive a separation-based algorithm\nto efficiently solve it. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed\napproach on a modified IEEE-30 bus network with wind uncertainty and compare\nwith other distributionally robust approaches.

According to their proponents, the sum of the\nsatellites' precessions of the longitudes of the ascending nodes $\\Omega$\nshould allow one to test the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect to a\n$\\simeq 0.2\\%$ accuracy level, with a contribution of the mismodeling in the\neven zonal harmonics $J_\\ell,~\\ell=2,4,6,\\ldots$ of the geopotential to the\ntotal error budget as little as $0.1\\%$.

The second key idea is to design a hardware\naccelerator that adopts modern FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)\narchitectures to further boost the performance of our algorithm.\n  Results: Shouji significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment\nfiltering by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art\npre-alignment filters, GateKeeper and SHD. Our FPGA-based accelerator is up to\nthree orders of magnitude faster than the equivalent CPU implementation of\nShouji. Using a single FPGA chip, we benchmark the benefits of integrating\nShouji with five state-of-the-art sequence aligners, designed for different\ncomputing platforms. The addition of Shouji as a pre-alignment step reduces the\nexecution time of the five state-of-the-art sequence aligners by up to 18.8x.\nShouji can be adapted for any bioinformatics pipeline that performs sequence\nalignment for verification. Unlike most existing methods that aim to accelerate\nsequence alignment, Shouji does not sacrifice any of the aligner capabilities,\nas it does not modify or replace the alignment step.\n  Availability: https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Shouji\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:38:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 20:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 09:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 14:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

In the\nnear future the anyonic engineering will provide the anyonic devices from which\nthe topological quantum computers will be constructed. From other side the\nstring anyons are interesting topological phases of matter which can be\ndescribed using mathematical constructions such as Frobenius algebras and\nopen-closed string topological quantum field theories which are based on\ncobordism categories. Recently was proposed that is possible to obtain\nrepresentations of cobordism categories using modular categories. In the\npresent work, the modular categories resulting as representations of the 3\ndimensional bordism 2 category are used with the aim to construct a new model\nof topological quantum computation. Such new model is named Sanyon Topological\nQuantum Computation and it is is theoretically performed by evolving non\nabelian string anyons (sanyons) using the Loop Braid Group and the open closed\ncobordism category. The output of the computation uniquely depends on how the\nsanyons have been braided by the Loop Braid Group and operated by the\ngenerators of the cobordism category. Small disturbances do not unravel the\nloop braids and the cobordisms, making the computation resistant to errors and\ndecoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 14:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

In this paper, we develop 'DYVERSE: DYnamic VERtical Scaling in\nEdge' environments, which is the first light-weight and dynamic vertical\nscaling mechanism for managing resources allocated to applications for\nfacilitating multi-tenancy in Edge environments. To enable dynamic vertical\nscaling, one static and three dynamic priority management approaches that are\nworkload-aware, community-aware and system-aware, respectively are proposed.\nThis research advocates that dynamic vertical scaling and priority management\napproaches reduce Service Level Objective (SLO) violation rates. An online-game\nand a face detection workload in a Cloud-Edge test-bed are used to validate the\nresearch. The merits of DYVERSE is that there is only a sub-second overhead per\nEdge server when 32 Edge servers are deployed on a single Edge node. When\ncompared to executing applications on the Edge servers without dynamic vertical\nscaling, static priorities and dynamic priorities reduce SLO violation rates of\nrequests by up to 4% and 12% for the online game, respectively, and in both\ncases 6% for the face detection workload. Moreover, for both workloads, the\nsystem-aware dynamic vertical scaling method effectively reduces the latency of\nnon-violated requests, when compared to other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 15:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 09:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

This paper presents a study on the effect of cold climate at high\naltitude on the PV system output. We report a comparative case study, which\npresents measurement results at two distinct sites, one at a height of 612\nmeters and another one at a mountain site at a height of 1764 meters. This case\nstudy applies the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique in order to\ndetermine maximum power from the PV panel at different azimuth and altitude\nangles. We used an Arduino system to measure and display the attributes of the\nPV system. The measurement results indicate an increased efficiency of 42% for\nPV systems at higher altitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 13:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}
