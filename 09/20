This results in a diffeomorphic but physically distinct\ngeometry which differs from the original black hole by their charges at\ninfinity.

The transverse momentum balance given\nby the jet-to-photon $p_\\mathrm{T}$ ratio, $x_\\mathrm{J\\gamma}$, is measured\nfor pairs with azimuthal opening angle $\\Delta\\phi > 7\\pi/8$. Distributions of\nthe per-photon jet yield as a function of $x_\\mathrm{J\\gamma}$,\n$(1/N_\\gamma)(\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}x_\\mathrm{J\\gamma})$, are corrected for\ndetector effects via a two-dimensional unfolding procedure and reported at the\nparticle level. In $pp$ collisions, the distributions are well described by\nMonte Carlo event generators. In Pb+Pb collisions, the $x_\\mathrm{J\\gamma}$\ndistribution is modified from that observed in $pp$ collisions with increasing\ncentrality, consistent with the picture of parton energy loss in the hot\nnuclear medium. The data are compared with a suite of energy-loss models and\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 16:20:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 14:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Not only is controller traffic subject to jitter due\nto unreliable links and network contention, but the overhead generated by SDN\ncan severely affect the performance of other traffic. This paper addresses the\nchallenge of bringing high-overhead SDN architecture to IEEE 802.15.4 networks.\nWe explore how traditional SDN needs to evolve in order to overcome the\nconstraints of low-power wireless networks, and discuss protocol and\narchitectural optimizations necessary to reduce SDN control overhead - the main\nbarrier to successful implementation.

Most previous\nstudies focused on exploring the role of the winds in the exposed PPDs with a\nsingle star; however, exploring the evolution of the circumbinary disks with\nthe photoevaporative winds driven by the host star radiation and external\nradiation sources deserves further investigation. In this study, we investigate\nthe evolution of the circumbinary PPDs with the photoevaporative winds induced\nby external far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We show that this mass-loss\nprocess can significantly constrain properties of a circumbinary PPD, including\nits lifetime, mass and radius. The lifetime of a circumbinary PPD, for\ninstance, is found by a factor of about two longer than a similar circumstellar\ndisk and this enhancement strongly depends on the viscosity parameter. But our\nmodel shows that viscosity dependence of the disk lifetime in the circumbinary\ncase is more pronounced compared to the circumstellar case. We also show that\ndispersal of a circumbinary PPD occurs over a longer time as the disk\ntemperature distribution becomes steeper.

Besides\ndirect emulation of the simulated uranium concentration time series, replacing\nthe original RTM by its emulator is also investigated for global sensitivity\nanalysis (GSA), uncertainty propagation (UP) and probabilistic calibration\nusing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The selected DNN is found to be\nsuperior to both GPs and PCE in reproducing the input - output behavior of the\nconsidered 8-dimensional and 13-dimensional CPU-intensive RTMs. Furthermore,\nthe two used PCE variants: standard PCE and sparse PCE (sPCE) appear to always\nprovide the least accuracy while not differing much in performance. As a\nconsequence of its better emulation capabilities, the used DNN outperforms the\ntwo other methods for UP. In addition, DNNs and GPs offer equally good\napproximations to the true first-order and total-order Sobol sensitivity\nindices while PCE does somewhat less well. Most surprisingly, despite its\nsuperior emulation skills the DNN approach leads to the worst solution of the\nconsidered synthetic inverse problem which involves 1224 measurement data with\nlow noise. This apparently contradicting behavior is at least partially due to\nthe small but complicated deterministic noise that affects the DNN-based\npredictions. Indeed, this complex error structure can drive the emulated\nsolutions far away from the true posterior distribution. Overall, our findings\nindicate that when the available training set is relatively small (75 - to 500\ninput - output examples) and fixed beforehand, DNNs can well emulate RTMs but\nare not suited to emulation-based inversion. In contrast, GPs perform fairly\nwell across all considered tasks: direct emulation, GSA, UP, and inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 08:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Recent research efforts\nin this direction have proposed shard-based consensus protocols where the key\nidea is to split the transactions among multiple committees (or shards), which\nthen process these shards or set of transactions in parallel. Such a parallel\nprocessing of disjoint sets of transactions or shards by multiple committees\nsignificantly improves the overall scalability and transaction throughout of\nthe system. However, one significant research gap is a lack of understanding of\nthe strategic behavior of rational processors within committees in such\nshard-based consensus protocols. Such an understanding is critical for\ndesigning appropriate incentives that will foster cooperation within committees\nand prevent free-riding. In this paper, we address this research gap by\nanalyzing the behavior of processors using a game-theoretic model, where each\nprocessor aims at maximizing its reward at a minimum cost of participating in\nthe protocol. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in an N-player static game\nmodel of the sharding protocol. We show that depending on the reward sharing\napproach employed, processors can potentially increase their payoff by\nunilaterally behaving in a defective fashion, thus resulting in a social\ndilemma. In order to overcome this social dilemma, we propose a novel\nincentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among\nprocessors. Our numerical results show that achieving a majority of cooperating\nprocessors (required to ensure a healthy state of the blockchain network) is\neasier to achieve with the proposed incentive-compatible reward sharing\nmechanism than with other reward sharing mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 23:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

This can reduce the number of\nvehicles in the street, which consequently can reduce air pollution, traffic\ncongestion and transportation cost. However, a ride-sharing organization\nrequires passengers to report sensitive location information about their trips\nto a trip organizing server (TOS) which creates a serious privacy issue. In\naddition, existing ride-sharing schemes are non-flexible, i.e., they require a\ndriver and a rider to have exactly the same trip to share a ride. Moreover,\nthey are non-scalable, i.e., inefficient if applied to large geographic areas.\nIn this paper, we propose two efficient privacy-preserving ride-sharing\norganization schemes for Non-transferable Ride-sharing Services (NRS) and\nTransferable Ride-sharing Services (TRS). In the NRS scheme, a rider can share\na ride from its source to destination with only one driver whereas, in TRS\nscheme, a rider can transfer between multiple drivers while en route until he\nreaches his destination. In both schemes, the ride-sharing area is divided into\na number of small geographic areas, called cells, and each cell has a unique\nidentifier. Each driver/rider should encrypt his trip's data and send an\nencrypted ride-sharing offer/request to the TOS. In NRS scheme, Bloom filters\nare used to compactly represent the trip information before encryption. Then,\nthe TOS can measure the similarity between the encrypted trips data to organize\nshared rides without revealing either the users' identities or the location\ninformation. In TRS scheme, drivers report their encrypted routes, an then the\nTOS builds an encrypted directed graph that is passed to a modified version of\nDijkstra's shortest path algorithm to search for an optimal path of rides that\ncan achieve a set of preferences defined by the riders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 18:09:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 12:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

We extend this concept to source coding with \"erasure\nside-information\" at the encoder and show that the performance of band-limited\nDFT can be significantly improved using irregular spectrum, and more generally,\nusing equiangular tight frames (ETF). Frames are overcomplete bases and are\nwidely used in mathematics, computer science, engineering, and statistics since\nthey provide a stable and robust decomposition. Design of frames with favorable\nproperties of random subframes is motivated in variety of applications,\nincluding code-devision multiple access (CDMA), compressed sensing and analog\ncoding. We present a novel relation between deterministic frames and random\nmatrix theory. We show empirically that the MANOVA ensemble offers a universal\ndescription of the spectra of randomly selected subframes with constant aspect\nratios, taken from deterministic near-ETFs. Moreover, we derive an analytic\nframework and bring a formal validation for some of the empirical results,\nspecifically that the asymptotic form for the moments of high orders of subsets\nof ETF agree with that of MANOVA. Finally, when exploring over-complete bases,\nthe Welch bound is a lower bound on the root mean square cross correlation\nbetween vectors. We extend the Welch bound to an erasure setting, in which a\nreduced frame, composed of a random subset of Bernoulli selected vectors, is of\ninterest. The lower bound involves moment of the reduced frame, and it is tight\nfor ETFs and asymptotically coincides with the MANOVA moments. This result\noffers a novel perspective on the superiority of ETFs over other frames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-20"}

The\nfocus of collider studies for such a scalar is often on its direct production,\nwhere the scalar is typically only mildly boosted. The observed $W/Z$ are\ntherefore well-separated, allowing analyses for the scalar resonance in a\nstandard fashion as a low-mass diboson resonance. In this work we instead focus\non the scenario where the direct production of the scalar is suppressed, and it\nis rather produced via the decay of a significantly heavier (a few TeV mass)\nnew particle, in conjunction with SM particles. Such a process results in the\nscalar being highly boosted, rendering the $W/Z$'s from its decay merged. The\nfinal state in such a decay is a \"fat\" jet, which can be either four-pronged\n(for fully hadronic $W/Z$ decays), or may be like a $W/Z$ jet, but with leptons\nburied inside (if one of the $W/Z$ decays leptonically). In addition, this fat\njet has a jet mass that can be quite different from that of the $W/Z$/Higgs/top\nquark-induced jet, and may be missed by existing searches. In this work, we\ndevelop dedicated algorithms for tagging such multi-layered \"boosted dibosons\"\nat the LHC. As a concrete application, we discuss an extension of the standard\nwarped extra-dimensional framework where such a light scalar can arise.

We also present pure-spin exchange/correlation\nfunctionals for the same few-EG solutions. Finally, we consider the family of\nfew-EG calculations in juxtaposition with the closely related uniform electron\ngas (UEG) system, for which previous calculations have been performed using\ndensity functional theory and quantum Monte Carlo methods. The exact few-EG\nsolutions all display a similar oscillatory behavior at lower densities, which\nis not predicted by previous UEG simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:47:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 22:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 00:42:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

These predictions will be\nimpacted by artifacts present in real data sets such as outliers, systematics\nerrors and unreliable or missing uncertainty bounds.

Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now\nproviding results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of\nconfirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the\nsame dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in ~1-3 Myr old\nstar-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates\nof their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and\nmultiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing\nto a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low\nmass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower\nthan the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses\nare comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found\nalso by converting the measured planet masses into heavy-element content (core\nmasses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and\nby comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are\nheavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient\nrecycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This\nimplies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly (<0.1-1 Myr)\nand large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or\nthat disks are continuously replenished of fresh planet-forming material from\nthe environment.

In that regime, the liquid surface is\npopulated by small disorganised deformations elongated in the streamwise\ndirection. Formally identified recently by Paquier et al. (2015), the\ndeformations that occur below the wave onset were named wrinkles. We provide\nhere a theoretical framework for this wrinkle regime, using the viscous\nresponse of a free surface liquid submitted to arbitrary normal and tangential\ninterfacial stresses at its upper boundary. We relate the spatio-temporal\nspectrum of the surface deformations to that of the applied interfacial\npressure and shear stress fluctuations. For that, we evaluate the\nspatio-temporal statistics of the turbulent forcing using Direct Numerical\nSimulation of a turbulent air channel flow, assuming no coupling between the\nair and the liquid flows. Combining theory and numerical simulation, we thus\nobtain synthetic wrinkles that reproduce previous experimental investigations.\nWe show that the wrinkles are a multi-scale superposition of random wakes\ngenerated by the turbulent fluctuations. They result mainly from the nearly\nisotropic pressure fluctuations generated in the boundary layer, rather than\nfrom the elongated shear stress fluctuations. The wrinkle regime described in\nthis paper naturally arises as the viscous-saturated asymptotic of the inviscid\ngrowth theory of Phillips (1957). Experiments indicate that the onset of\nexponential wave growth depends on the liquid viscosity. Our theory suggests\nthat the empirical criterion for the onset is satisfied when the wrinkle\namplitude reaches a given fraction of the viscous sublayer thickness. It\nindicates that the turbulent fluctuations near the onset may play a role in the\ntriggering of exponential wave growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 20:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

During the first two years\nof the primary mission, one of these cameras, Camera #1, is going to observe\nfields centered at an ecliptic latitude of 18 degrees. While the ecliptic plane\nitself is not covered during the primary mission, the characteristic scale\nheight of the main asteroid belt and Kuiper belt implies that a significant\namount of small solar system bodies will cross the field-of-view of this\ncamera. Based on the comparison of the expected amount of information of TESS\nand Kepler/K2, we can compute the cumulative etendues of the two optical\nsetups. This comparison results in roughly comparable optical etendues, however\nthe net etendue is significantly larger in the case of TESS since all of the\nimaging data provided by the 30-minute cadence frames are downlinked rather\nthan the pre-selected stamps of Kepler/K2. In addition, many principles of the\ndata acquisition and optical setup are clearly different, including the level\nof confusing background sources, full-frame integration and cadence, the\nfield-of-view centroid with respect to the apparent position of the Sun, as\nwell as the differences in the duration of the campaigns. As one would expect,\nTESS will yield time-series photometry and hence rotational properties for only\nbrighter objects, but in terms of spatial and phase space coverage, this sample\nwill be more homogeneous and more complete. Here we review the main analogues\nand differences between the Kepler/K2 mission and the TESS mission, focusing on\nscientific implications and possible yields related to our Solar System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Second, we need to choose a proper test statistic. For a general weak\nnull hypothesis, we propose an approach to imputing missing potential outcomes\nunder a compatible sharp null hypothesis.

The transition between the two phases proved to be analogous to\ncontinuous phase transitions. Computer simulations revealed that during\nunloading the fracture proceeds in bursts of local breakings triggered by\nslowly accumulating damage. In both phases the time evolution starts with a\nrelaxation of the bursting activity characterized by a universal power law\ndecay of the burst rate. In the phase of finite lifetime the initial slowdown\nis followed by an acceleration towards macroscopic failure where the increasing\nrate of bursts obeys the (inverse) Omori law of earthquakes.

Chest X-ray is currently one of the most popular methods to diagnose\nthoracic diseases, playing an important role in the healthcare workflow.\nHowever, reading the chest X-ray images and giving an accurate diagnosis remain\nchallenging tasks for expert radiologists. With the success of deep learning in\ncomputer vision, a growing number of deep neural network architectures were\napplied to chest X-ray image classification. However, most of the previous deep\nneural network classifiers were based on deterministic architectures which are\nusually very noise-sensitive and are likely to aggravate the overfitting issue.\nIn this paper, to make a deep architecture more robust to noise and to reduce\noverfitting, we propose using deep generative classifiers to automatically\ndiagnose thorax diseases from the chest X-ray images. Unlike the traditional\ndeterministic classifier, a deep generative classifier has a distribution\nmiddle layer in the deep neural network. A sampling layer then draws a random\nsample from the distribution layer and input it to the following layer for\nclassification. The classifier is generative because the class label is\ngenerated from samples of a related distribution. Through training the model\nwith a certain amount of randomness, the deep generative classifiers are\nexpected to be robust to noise and can reduce overfitting and then achieve good\nperformances. We implemented our deep generative classifiers based on a number\nof well-known deterministic neural network architectures, and tested our models\non the chest X-ray14 dataset.

However, the accuracy, latency, and computational cost of\nsuch methods remain insufficient. The majority of the previous methods have\nformulated the separation problem through the time-frequency representation of\nthe mixed signal, which has several drawbacks, including the decoupling of the\nphase and magnitude of the signal, the suboptimality of time-frequency\nrepresentation for speech separation, and the long latency in calculating the\nspectrograms. To address these shortcomings, we propose a fully-convolutional\ntime-domain audio separation network (Conv-TasNet), a deep learning framework\nfor end-to-end time-domain speech separation. Conv-TasNet uses a linear encoder\nto generate a representation of the speech waveform optimized for separating\nindividual speakers. Speaker separation is achieved by applying a set of\nweighting functions (masks) to the encoder output. The modified encoder\nrepresentations are then inverted back to the waveforms using a linear decoder.\nThe masks are found using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) consisting of\nstacked 1-D dilated convolutional blocks, which allows the network to model the\nlong-term dependencies of the speech signal while maintaining a small model\nsize. The proposed Conv-TasNet system significantly outperforms previous\ntime-frequency masking methods in separating two- and three-speaker mixtures.\nAdditionally, Conv-TasNet surpasses several ideal time-frequency magnitude\nmasks in two-speaker speech separation as evaluated by both objective\ndistortion measures and subjective quality assessment by human listeners.\nFinally, Conv-TasNet has a significantly smaller model size and a shorter\nminimum latency, making it a suitable solution for both offline and real-time\nspeech separation applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 02:38:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 02:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 07:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

One main challenge for optimizing IQP matching problem is how to\nincorporate the discrete one-to-one mapping (permutation) constraint in its\nquadratic objective optimization. In this paper, we present a new relaxation\nmodel, called Sparse Constraint Preserving Matching (SPM), for IQP matching\nproblem. SPM is motivated by our observation that the discrete permutation\nconstraint can be well encoded via a sparse constraint. Comparing with\ntraditional relaxation models, SPM can incorporate the discrete one-to-one\nmapping constraint straightly via a sparse constraint and thus provides a\ntighter relaxation for original IQP matching problem.

Wireless distributed computing presents new opportunities by pooling\nthe computation and storage resources among devices. For low-latency\napplications, the key bottleneck lies in the exchange of intermediate results\namong mobile devices for data shuffling. To improve communication efficiency,\nwe propose a co-channel communication model and design transceivers by\nexploiting the locally computed intermediate values as side information. A\nlow-rank optimization model is proposed to maximize the achieved\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoF) by establishing the interference alignment condition\nfor data shuffling. Unfortunately, existing approaches to approximate the rank\nfunction fail to yield satisfactory performance due to the poor structure in\nthe formulated low-rank optimization problem. In this paper, we develop an\nefficient DC algorithm to solve the presented low-rank optimization problem by\nproposing a novel DC representation for the rank function. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed DC approach can significantly improve\nthe communication efficiency whereas the achievable DoF almost remains\nunchanged when the number of mobile devices grows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 03:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Although a wide-range of defense techniques have been\ndeveloped against these attacks, the existing mitigation strategies have\nseveral limitations. In particular, most of the existing mitigation approaches\nare based on aborting or restarting the victim program when a memory-safety\nattack is detected, thus making the system unavailable. This might not be\nacceptable in systems with stringent timing constraints, such as cyber-physical\nsystems (CPS), since the system unavailability leaves the control system in an\nunsafe state. To address this problem, we propose CIMA -- a resilient and\nlight-weight mitigation technique that prevents invalid memory accesses at\nruntime. CIMA manipulates the compiler-generated control flow graph to\nautomatically detect and bypass unsafe memory accesses at runtime, thereby\nmitigating memory-safety attacks along the process. An appealing feature of\nCIMA is that it also ensures system availability and resilience of the CPS even\nunder the presence of memory-safety attacks. To this end, we design our\nexperimental setup based on a realistic Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and\nSecure Urban Transportation System (SecUTS) testbeds and evaluate the\neffectiveness and the efficiency of our approach.

Existing algorithms capable of\nextracting task-level representations from high-dimensional inputs, e.g. object\ndetection, often produce outputs of varying lengths, restricting their use in\nRL methods due to the need for neural networks to have fixed length inputs.

We find that\na desiccated TRAPPIST-1 h may produce habitable surface temperatures beyond the\nmaximum greenhouse distance. Potential observational discriminants for these\natmospheres in transmission and emission spectra are influenced by\nphotochemical processes and aerosol formation, and include collision-induced\noxygen absorption (O2-O2), and O3, CO, SO2, H2O, and CH4 absorption features,\nwith transit signals of up to 200 ppm. Our simulated transmission spectra are\nconsistent with K2, HST, and Spitzer observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.\nFor several terrestrial atmospheric compositions, we find that TRAPPIST-1 b is\nunlikely to produce aerosols. These results can inform JWST observation\nplanning and data interpretation for the TRAPPIST-1 system and other M dwarf\nterrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

Unfortunately, a number of issues surrounding the von\nNeumann entropy remain unsolved to date, including the interpretation of this\nspectral measure in terms of structural patterns, understanding the relation\nbetween its two variants, and evaluating the quality of the corresponding\napproximations.\n  In this paper we aim to answer these questions by first analysing and\ncomparing the quadratic approximations of the two variants and then performing\nan extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs. We\nfind that 1) the two entropies lead to the emergence of similar structures, but\nwith some significant differences; 2) the correlation between them ranges from\nweakly positive to strongly negative, depending on the topology of the\nunderlying graph; 3) the quadratic approximations fail to capture the presence\nof non-trivial structural patterns that seem to influence the value of the\nexact entropies; 4) the quality of the approximations, as well as which variant\nof the von Neumann entropy is better approximated, depends on the topology of\nthe underlying graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 08:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Accordingly, we theoretically analyze\nthe solvable rate of RA UEs with multiple preambles and propose a reliable UE\ndetection algorithm to obtain the super preambles of RA UEs by exploiting the\nquasi-orthogonality characteristic of massive MIMO.

We use this result to investigate the trade off between\nprice efficiency and 'fairness': we consider a regulator that wants to minimise\npost-trade standard deviation for a given level of uninformed traders' losses.\nThe minimisation is over the function space of penalties; for each possible\npenalty, our existence and uniqueness theorem allows to define unambiguously\nthe post-trade standard deviation and the uninformed traders' losses that\nprevail in equilibrium.Optimal penalties are characterized in closed-form.

This method is applied to the Stereo-SCIDAR dataset from ESO\nParanal containing over 10000 measurements of the turbulence profile from 83\nnights. We present two methods of extracting turbulence profiles from the\nclusters, resulting in two sets of 18 profiles providing subtly different\ndescriptions of the variability across the entire dataset. For generality we\nchoose integrated parameters of the turbulence to measure the\nrepresentativeness of our profiles and compare to others. Using these criterion\nwe also show that such variability is difficult to capture with small sets of\nprofiles associated with integrated turbulence parameters such as seeing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 10:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

This approach makes the robots to\nbehave as a cohesive whole, which can be useful in tasks such as collaborative\ntransportation. The robustness of the algorithm relies on the fact that each\nrobot employs only local measurements from a laser sensor which does not need\nto be off-line calibrated. Furthermore, robots do not need to exchange any\ninformation with each other. Being free of sensor calibration and not requiring\na communication channel helps the scaling of the overall system to a large\nnumber of robots.

This is important as it is the chemical composition that regulates\nthe thermal structure of the wind, the creation of dust grains in the wind, and\nultimately the mass loss by the wind.

No sustainable\nwind arises in a purely hydrodynamical model with physically reasonable\npulsations. Moreover, temperatures are too high for dust formation to happen,\nrendering radiative pressure on grains impossible. A hydrochemical wind is even\nharder to initiate due to efficient chemical cooling. However, temperatures are\nsufficiently low in dense regions for dust formation to take place. These\nregions occur close to the star, which is needed for radiation pressure on dust\nto sufficiently aid in creating a wind.

In\norder to study its molecular content and dynamical state, we mapped this\nfilament in seven species. Among them, HCO$^{+}$, HNC, HCN, and CS show\nself-absorption, while C$^{18}$O is most sensitive to the filamentary\nstructure. A kinematic analysis demonstrates that this filament forms a\nvelocity-coherent (trans-)sonic structure, a large part of which is one of the\nmost quiescent regions in the Serpens cloud. Widespread C$^{18}$O depletion is\nfound throughout the Serpens filament. Based on the Herschel dust-derived\nH$_{2}$ column density map, the line mass of the filament is\n36--41~M$_{\\odot}$~pc$^{-1}$, and its full width at half maximum is\n0.17$\\pm$0.01~pc, while its length is ~1.6~pc. The inner radial column density\nprofile of this filament can be well fitted with a Plummer profile with an\nexponent of 2.2$\\pm$0.1, a scale radius of $0.018\\pm 0.003$ pc, and a central\ndensity of $(4.0\\pm 0.8)\\times 10^{4}$~cm$^{-3}$.

The widespread blue-skewed HNC and CS line\nprofiles and HCN hyperfine line anomalies across this filament indicate radial\ninfall in parts of the Serpens filament. C$^{18}$O velocity gradients also\nindicate accretion flows along the filament. The velocity and density\nstructures suggest that such accretion flows are likely due to a longitudinal\ncollapse parallel to the filament's long axis. Both the radial infall rate and\nthe longitudinal accretion rate along the Serpens filament are lower than all\npreviously reported values in other filaments. This indicates that the Serpens\nfilament lies at an early evolutionary stage when collapse has just begun, or\nthat thermal and non-thermal support are effective in providing support against\ngravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 12:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

We use the 0.2$''$ angular resolution $JHK_s$ data from\nthe GALACTICNUCLEUS survey to study the stellar population within two\n$8.0'\\times 3.4'$ fields, about 0.6$^\\circ$ and 0.4$^\\circ$ to the Galactic\nnorth of the Milky Way's centre and to compare it with one in the immediate\nsurroundings of Sagittarius A*. We also characterise the extinction curve of\nthe two fields. The average interstellar extinction to the outer and the inner\nfield is $A_{K_s} \\sim 1.20 \\pm 0.08$ mag and $\\sim 1.48 \\pm 0.10$ mag,\nrespectively. We present $K_{s}$ luminosity functions that are complete down to\nat least 2 mag below the red clump (RC). We detect a feature in the luminosity\nfunctions that is fainter than the RC by $0.80\\pm0.03$ and $0.79\\pm0.02$ mag,\nrespectively, in the $K_s$-band. It runs parallel to the reddening vector. We\nidentify the feature as the red giant branch bump. Fitting $\\alpha$-enhanced\nBaSTI luminosity functions to our data, we find that a single old stellar\npopulation of $\\sim12.8 \\pm 0.6$ Gyr and $Z = 0.040 \\pm 0.003$ provides the\nbest fit. We obtain that the stellar population in the innermost bulge is old,\nsimilar to the one at larger distances from the Galactic plane, and that its\nmetallicity increases down to distances as short as about 60 pc from the centre\nof the Milky Way. Comparing it with previous known values at larger latitudes\n($|b|>2^\\circ$), our results favour a flattening of the gradient at\n$|b|<2^\\circ$. As a secondary result we obtain that the extinction index in the\nstudied regions agrees the value of $\\alpha = 2.30\\pm0.08$, derived in\nNogueras-Lara et al. 2018 for the very Galactic centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 13:53:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 15:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

Its fundamental mechanism, inertial\ncavitation, is poorly understood and often ignored in ultrasonication\nstrategies resulting in low exfoliation rates, low material yields and wide\nflake size distributions, making the graphene dispersions produced by\nultrasonication less economically viable. Here we report that few-layer\ngraphene yields of up to 18% in three hours without introduction of basal plane\ndefects can be achieved by optimising inertial cavitation during\nultrasonication. We demonstrate that the yield and the graphene flake\ndimensions exhibit a power law relationship with inertial cavitation dose.\nFurthermore, inertial cavitation is shown to preferentially exfoliate larger\ngraphene flakes which causes the exfoliation rate to decrease as a function of\nsonication time. This study demonstrates that measurement and control of\ninertial cavitation is critical in optimising the high yield\nsonication-assisted aqueous liquid phase exfoliation of size-selected\nnanomaterials.

For\nsimple effort tasks, an increase in the pressure experienced by an individual,\ne.g. due to incentive schemes in a workplace, will increase the effort put into\nthe task and hence in most cases also the performance. For the more complex and\nusually harder to capture case of skill tasks, there exists a substantial body\nof literature that fairly consistently reports a choking phenomenon under\npressure.

We find that star-forming cluster\nand field galaxies show similar median specific SFRs in a given mass bin, but\ntheir O/H values are displaced to higher values at projected radii of R<R200\ncompared with galaxies at larger radii and in the field. The comparison with\nmetallicity-SFR-mass model predictions with inflowing gas indicates a\nslow-quenching scenario in which strangulation is initiated when galaxies pass\nR~R200 by stopping the inflow of gas. The metallicities of cluster members\ninside R200 are thereby increasing, but their SFRs are hardly affected for a\nperiod of time, because these galaxies consume available disk gas.

From the\none-point budget equation of the turbulent kinetic energy, it is shown that the\nmean dissipation rate is nearly unchanged by variable viscosity effects.

Carr in 2008, and then further elaborated on by Carr\nand Nadtochiy, 2017 (CN2017), and Carr and Itkin, 2018 (CI2018). As compared\nwith the latest version of the model developed in CI2018 and called the ELVG\n(the Expanded Local Variance Gamma model), here we provide two innovations.\nFirst, in all previous papers the model was constructed based on a Gamma\ntime-changed {\\it arithmetic} Brownian motion: with no drift in CI2017, and\nwith drift in CI2018, and the local variance to be a function of the spot level\nonly. In contrast, here we develop a {\\it geometric} version of this model with\ndrift. Second, in CN2017 the model was calibrated to option smiles assuming the\nlocal variance is a piecewise constant function of strike, while in CI2018 the\nlocal variance is a piecewise linear} function of strike. In this paper we\nconsider 3 piecewise linear models: the local variance as a function of strike,\nthe local variance as function of log-strike, and the local volatility as a\nfunction of strike (so, the local variance is a piecewise quadratic function of\nstrike).

Open set learning poses a realistic learning scenario that is\nreceiving growing attention. Existing studies on open set learning mainly\nfocused on detecting novel classes, but few studies tried to model them for\ndifferentiating novel classes. In this paper, we recognize that novel classes\nshould be different from each other, and propose distribution networks for open\nset learning that can model different novel classes based on probability\ndistributions. We hypothesize that, through a certain mapping, samples from\ndifferent classes with the same classification criterion should follow\ndifferent probability distributions from the same distribution family. A deep\nneural network is learned to map the samples in the original feature space to a\nlatent space where the distributions of known classes can be jointly learned\nwith the network.

The results show that for the fractional\nBrownian motion (fBm) without intermittency correction the measured extremal\npoint density (EPD) agrees well with a theoretical prediction. For a\nmultifractal random walk (MRW) with the lognormal statistics, the measured EPD\nis independent with the intermittency parameter $\\mu$, suggesting that the\nintermittency correction does not change the distribution of extremal points,\nbut change the amplitude.

Referred to as DSVO (Direct Stereo Visual Odometry), it operates\ndirectly on pixel intensities, without any explicit feature matching, and is\nthus efficient and more accurate than the state-of-the-art\nstereo-matching-based methods. It applies a semi-direct monocular visual\nodometry running on one camera of the stereo pair, tracking the camera pose and\nmapping the environment simultaneously; the other camera is used to optimize\nthe scale of monocular visual odometry. We evaluate DSVO in a number of\nchallenging scenes to evaluate its performance and present comparisons with the\nstate-of-the-art stereo visual odometry algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 14:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

This formula is useful for pricing and risk\nmanagement as well as for extracting the implied volatility from quoted\noptions. The latter is of particular importance since it indicates the risk of\nthe underlying and it is the main component of the option's price. Further we\nestimate numerically the approximating error of the suggested solution and, by\ncomparing our results in computing the implied volatility with the most common\nmethods available in literature we discuss the challenges of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 11:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

From\nmeasurements spanning two days we extract the drift of the fiber TM.

Public opinion on a\nprospective regional leader can help predict electability and tendency of\nvoters. Data that can be used by the opinion mining process can be obtained\nfrom Twitter. Because the data is very varied form and very unstructured, it\nmust be managed and uninformed using data pre-processing techniques into\nsemi-structured data. This semi-structured information is followed by a\nclassification stage to categorize the opinion into negative or positive\nopinions. The research methodology uses a literature study where the research\nwill examine previous research on a similar topic. The purpose of this study is\nto find the right architecture to develop it into the application of twitter\nopinion mining to know public sentiments toward the election of the governor of\nwest java. The result of this research is that Twitter opinion mining is part\nof text mining where opinions in Twitter if they want to be classified, must go\nthrough the preprocessing text stage first. The preprocessing step required\nfrom twitter data is cleansing, case folding, POS Tagging and stemming. The\nresulting text mining architecture is an architecture that can be used for text\nmining research with different topics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}
