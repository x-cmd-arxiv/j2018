Games in which the players do\nnot have an identical strategy set are hypergames. Studies of hypergame\ndynamics have been scarce, especially those on networks. We investigate\nevolutionary hypergame dynamics on regular lattices using a prototypical model\nof three available strategies, in which the strategy set of each player\ncontains two of the three strategies. Our computations reveal that more complex\ndynamical phases emerge from the system than those from the traditional\nevolutionary game dynamics with full knowledge of the complete set of available\nstrategies, which include single-strategy absorption phases, a cyclic\ncompetition (`rock-paper-scissors') type of phase, and an uncertain phase in\nwhich the dominant strategy adopted by the population is unpredictable.\nExploiting the pair interaction and mean field approximations, we obtain a\nqualitative understanding of the emergence of the single strategy and uncertain\nphases. We find the striking phenomenon of strategy revival associated with the\ncyclic competition phase and provide a qualitative explanation.Our work\ndemonstrates that the diversity in the individuals' strategy set can play an\nimportant role in the evolution of strategy distribution in the system. From\nthe point of view of control, the emergence of the complex phases offers the\npossibility for harnessing evolutionary game dynamics through small changes in\nindividuals' probability of strategy adoption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 16:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The deconfinement in AdS/QCD is related to the\nHawking-Page phase transition, in which the critical Hawking temperature is\nidentified with the deconfinement one in the gauge theory. The numeric\nestimation of the latter is only possible when the parameters of a $5D$ dual\nmodel are previously determined from consistency with other physical aspects,\nstandardly, providing a description of the QCD resonances. The traditional way\nto fix parameters in the simplest AdS/QCD models is to reproduce the mass of\nthe $\\rho$ meson or the slope of the approximate radial Regge trajectory of the\n$\\rho$ excitations. Motivated by a general idea that the slope value originates\nin gluodynamics, we propose calculating the deconfinement temperature using the\ntrajectory of scalar glueballs. We consider several holographic models and use\nthe recent idea of isospectral potentials to make an additional check of the\nrelevance of our approach. It is demonstrated that different models from an\nisospectral family (i.e. the models leading to identical predictions for\nspectrum of hadrons with fixed quantum numbers) result in different predictions\nfor the deconfinement temperature. This difference is found to be quite small\nin the scalar glueball channel but very large in the vector meson channel. The\nobserved stability in the former case clearly favours the choice of the\nglueball channel for thermodynamic predictions in AdS/QCD models. For a\nbalanced approach, we argue that either assuming $f_0(1500)$ to have a\ndominating component of $0^{++}$ glueball or accepting the idea of the\nuniversality in the radial Regge trajectories of light non-strange vector\nmesons one can reproduce the results for the deconfinement temperature obtained\nbefore in the lattice simulations in the background of non-dynamical quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 16:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 17:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

However, reinforcement learning research with\nphysical robots faces substantial resistance due to the lack of benchmark tasks\nand supporting source code. In this work, we introduce several reinforcement\nlearning tasks with multiple commercially available robots that present varying\nlevels of learning difficulty, setup, and repeatability. On these tasks, we\ntest the learning performance of off-the-shelf implementations of four\nreinforcement learning algorithms and analyze sensitivity to their\nhyper-parameters to determine their readiness for applications in various\nreal-world tasks. Our results show that with a careful setup of the task\ninterface and computations, some of these implementations can be readily\napplicable to physical robots. We find that state-of-the-art learning\nalgorithms are highly sensitive to their hyper-parameters and their relative\nordering does not transfer across tasks, indicating the necessity of re-tuning\nthem for each task for best performance. On the other hand, the best\nhyper-parameter configuration from one task may often result in effective\nlearning on held-out tasks even with different robots, providing a reasonable\ndefault.

We explore explicit observables\nequations and their concrete solutions for a translation- and\nreparametrization-invariant action, thereby populating the following variety of\nnotions of observables with examples. 1) The brackets can be strongly or weakly\nzero in Dirac's sense, i.e.\\ a linear combination of constraints. 2)\nObservables can admit pure-configuration and pure-momentum restrictions. 3) Our\nmodel provides the translation constraint P$_i$ encoding zero total momentum of\nthe model universe and depending homogeneous-linearly on momenta, and the\nChronos constraint equation of time reinterpretation of the `constant-energy\ncondition' and depending quadratically on momenta.

We use a kinematic decomposition technique to separate the\nindividual contributions to the spectra of the two distinct kinematic\ncomponents observed at each spatial position in the field of view. By folding\nback the outcome of a photometric decomposition we reduce the intrinsic\ndegeneracies in recovering the kinematics and the best-fitting stellar spectral\ntemplates. Finally, by extracting the Lick line-strength indices for the\nindividual components and fitting them to single stellar population models we\nderive their ages, metallicities, and {\\alpha}/Fe overabundances.\n  Results. The two kinematically decoupled stellar components in NGC 448 have\nsimilar ages, but different chemical compositions. The distinct kinematic\nfeature in NGC 448 has a nearly exponential surface-brightness light profile,\ndominates in the innermost ~ 10\", is smaller in size, and is very likely an\nembedded counter-rotating disk as also indicated by its kinematics.

In\ncases with large $A_b$ or $A_t$, MSUSY as a common mass of the extra fermions\nand scalars can be as high as $10^{17}$ GeV remaining consistent with $m_h$ and\nthe vacuum longevity if $m_t$ is smaller than the central value by $2\\sigma$.\nFor the central value of $m_t$, the upper limit on MSUSY does not change very\nmuch owing to the metastability, which is the case also in the split MSSM even\nwith $\\pm 2\\sigma$ variations in $m_t$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

Using a recently developed\nnon-perturbative and numerically-exact projective quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulation as well as other numerical and analytic techniques, only for Dirac\nfermions with long-range Coulomb interactions do we find a universal\nsquare-root decrease of the Fermi-surface anisotropy. For the half-filled\ncomposite Fermi liquid, this result is surprising since a Dirac fermion ground\nstate was only recently proposed as an alternative to the usual HLR state. The\nimportance of the long-range interaction, expected for Dirac systems, is also\nconsistent with recent transport measurements.

More precisely, we study decay\nproperties for the energy of solutions to the scalar, linear wave equation\n$\\Box_{g_{\\textup{ring}}} \\Psi=0$, where $g_{\\textup{ring}}$ is the metric of a\nfixed black ring solution to the five-dimensional Einstein vacuum equations.\nFor a class $\\mathfrak{g}$ of black ring metrics, we prove a logarithmic lower\nbound for the uniform energy decay rate on the black ring exterior\n$(\\mathcal{D},g_{\\textup{ring}})$, with $g_{\\textup{ring}}\\in\\mathfrak{g}$. The\nproof generalizes the perturbation argument and quasimode construction of\nHolzegel--Smulevici \\cite{SharpLogHolz} to the case of a non-separable wave\nequation and crucially relies on the presence of stably trapped null geodesics\non $\\mathcal{D}$. As a by-product, the same logarithmic lower bound can be\nestablished for any five-dimensional black string.\n  Our result is the first mathematically rigorous statement supporting the\nexpectation that black rings are dynamically unstable to generic perturbations.\nIn particular, we conjecture a new \\textit{nonlinear} instability for\nfive-dimensional black strings and thin black rings which is already present at\nthe level of scalar perturbations and clearly differs from the mechanism driven\nby the well-known Gregory--Laflamme instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 18:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Yet, there is no clear consensus on their physical\ndriving mechanism(s). We have previously shown that AGN radiative feedback,\ndriven by radiation pressure on dust, can account for the observed dynamics and\nenergetics of galactic outflows, provided that radiation trapping is taken into\naccount. Here we generalise our model results by explicitly considering the\ntemporal evolution of the central AGN luminosity, and the shell mass evolution\nin different ambient density distributions. In the case of fixed-mass shells,\nthe high observed values of the momentum ratio ($\\zeta = \\dot{p}/(L/c)$) and\nenergy ratio ($\\epsilon_k = \\dot{E}_{k}/L$) may be attributed to either\nradiation trapping or AGN luminosity decay. In contrast, for expanding shells\nsweeping up mass from the surrounding environment, a decay in AGN luminosity\ncannot account for the observed high energetics, and radiation trapping is\nnecessarily required. Indeed, strong radiation trapping, e.g. due to high\ndust-to-gas ratios, can considerably boost the outflow energetics. We obtain a\ndistinct radial dependence for the outflow energetics ($\\zeta(r)$,\n$\\epsilon_k(r)$) in the case of radiation trapping and luminosity decay, which\nmay help discriminate between the two scenarios. In this framework, the\nrecently discovered `fossil' outflows, with anomalously high values of the\nenergetics, may be interpreted as relics of past AGN activity. The observed\noutflow properties may therefore provide useful constraints on the past history\nof AGN activity and/or the physical conditions of the outflow launch region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 18:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being\ncompromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of\npublications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists,\nshorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such\ncitation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers,\nself-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal's\nimpact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of\npapers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of\nauthors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of over 2600 research fields, we\nobserved that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing\nresearchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Academic\npublishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure\nsuccess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 20:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

The main challenge in controlling this kind of system\narises from the dynamic behavior imposed by the load, which is usually coupled\nto the UAV by means of a rope, adding unactuated degrees of freedom to the\nwhole system. Furthermore, to perform the load transportation it is often\nneeded the knowledge of the load position to accomplish the task. Since\navailable sensors are commonly embedded in the mobile platform, information on\nthe load position may not be directly available. To solve this problem in this\nwork, initially, the kinematics of the multi-body mechanical system are\nformulated from the load's perspective, from which a detailed dynamic model is\nderived using the Euler-Lagrange approach, yielding a highly coupled, nonlinear\nstate-space representation of the system, affine in the inputs, with the load's\nposition and orientation directly represented by state variables. A zonotopic\nstate estimator is proposed to solve the problem of estimating the load\nposition and orientation, which is formulated based on sensors located at the\naircraft, with different sampling times, and unknown-but-bounded measurement\nnoise.

Many known crystalline materials with low\nthermal conductivity, including PbTe and Bi2Te3, possess a special kind of\nchemical bond called \"resonant bond\". Resonant bonds consist of superposition\nof degenerate bonding configurations that leads to structural instability,\nanomalous long-range interatomic interaction and soft optical phonons. These\nfactors contribute to large lattice anharmonicity and strong phonon-phonon\nscattering, which result in low thermal conductivity. In this work, we use\nfirst-principles simulation to investigate the effect of resonant bonding in\ntwo dimensions (2D), where resonant bonds are in proximity to the surface. We\nfind that the long-range interatomic interaction due to resonant bonding\nbecomes more prominent in 2D due to reduced screening of the\natomic-displacement-induced charge density distortion. To demonstrate this\neffect, we analyze the phonon properties of quasi-2D Bi2PbTe4 with an ultralow\nthermal conductivity of 0.74 W/mK at 300K. By comparing the interatomic force\nconstants of quasi-2D Bi2PbTe4 and its bulk counterpart, and the properties of\nresonant bonds near the surface and in the bulk, we conclude that resonant\nbonds are significantly enhanced in reduced dimensions and are more effective\nin reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. Our results will provide new\nclues to searching for thermal insulators in low-dimensional materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 21:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

In contrast, we present an approach\nthat eschews such rich representations and seeks to create task-driven\nrepresentations. The key technical insight is to leverage the theory of\ninformation bottlenecks}to formalize the notion of a \"task-driven\nrepresentation\" in terms of information theoretic quantities that measure the\nminimality of a representation.

The FPF is an interacting\nsystem of $N$ particles where the interaction is designed such that the\nempirical distribution of the particles approximates the posterior\ndistribution. It is known that in the mean-field limit ($N=\\infty$), the\ndistribution of the particles is equal to the posterior distribution. However\nlittle is known about the convergence to the mean-field limit. In this paper,\nwe consider the FPF algorithm for the linear Gaussian setting. In this setting,\nthe algorithm is similar to the ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter algorithm. Although\nthese algorithms have been numerically evaluated and widely used in\napplications, their convergence and long-term stability analysis remains an\nactive area of research. In this paper, we show that, (i) the mean-field limit\nis well-defined with a unique strong solution; (ii) the mean-field process is\nstable with respect to the initial condition; (iii) we provide conditions such\nthat the finite-$N$ system is long term stable and we obtain some mean-squared\nerror estimates that are uniform in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 23:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

CSD querying has a wide range of applications, such as routing\nin telecommunications and transportation. With an increasing prevalence of\ncloud computing paradigm, graph owners desire to outsource their graphs to\ncloud servers. In order to protect sensitive information, these graphs are\nusually encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. This, however, imposes\na great challenge to CSD querying over encrypted graphs. Since performing\nconstraint filtering is an intractable task, existing work mainly focuses on\nunconstrained shortest distance queries. CSD querying over encrypted graphs\nremains an open research problem. In this paper, we propose Connor, a novel\ngraph encryption scheme that enables approximate CSD querying.

By particle-in-cell simulations, we find that when\nonly jet electrons are fully magnetized, they are directly deflected by the\nmagnetic field, but jet protons are mainly dragged by collective\ncharge-separation electric field. However, when both electrons and protons are\nfully magnetized, the contrary is the case. Their balance tremendously distorts\nthe jet density and electromagnetic fields, leading to enormous energy exchange\nbetween different species and fields. As a result, the electron spectrum energy\ndistribution (SED) gets reshaped and the power law slope of the SED decreases\nas the magnetic field strength increases. In other words, we may infer that\nmagnetic fields around the relativistic jet play a crucial role in shaping the\nobserved SED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 02:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

However, despite its advantages, many potential users with enormous\namounts of sensitive data (big data) refrain from fully utilizing the cloud\nstorage service due to valid concerns about data privacy. An established\nsolution to the cloud data privacy problem is to perform encryption on the\nclient-end. This approach, however, restricts data processing capabilities (eg,\nsearching over the data). Accordingly, the research problem we investigate is\nhow to enable real-time searching over the encrypted big data in the cloud. In\nparticular, semantic search is of interest to clients dealing with big data. To\naddress this problem, in this research, we develop a system (termed S3BD) for\nsearching big data using cloud services without exposing any data to cloud\nproviders. To keep real-time response on big data, S3BD proactively prunes the\nsearch space to a subset of the whole dataset. For that purpose, we propose a\nmethod to cluster the encrypted data. An abstract of each cluster is maintained\non the client-end to navigate the search operation to appropriate clusters at\nthe search time. Results of experiments, carried out on real-world big\ndatasets, demonstrate that the search operation can be achieved in real-time\nand is significantly more efficient than other counterparts. In addition, a\nfully functional prototype of S3BD is made publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 02:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

However, the interpretation of\ntrustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance\nattitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty\nassociated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data\nintegrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk\nattitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference\nmodel and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that\nquantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices in the presence\nof an adversaries who manipulate the data. We consider an imperfect anomaly\nmonitoring mechanism that monitors the data being sent from each device and\nclassifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred.\nThese outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian\ninference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a\nutility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use a prospect theory\ninspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate the\ntrustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. Furthermore, we\nalso model the system using the traditionally used expected utility theory and\ncompare the results with that obtained using prospect theory. As decisions are\nbased on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models: one optimistic\nand another conservative.

Serendipitously however many\nrodent species have convergently evolved the ability to produce USVs in a\nsimilar manner. In this paper we use rodent USV as a model process to help us\ngain insight into the production mechanism for mammalian USV as a whole. We\nderive a model that describes the production of rodent USVs by considering the\ninteraction of an unstable jet, emerging from the vocal folds, with the passive\nresonance modes of the upper vocal tract.

The diffuse emission from the unshocked SN ejecta has a\nform of clumps, filaments, and arcs, and their spatial distribution correlates\nwell with that of the Spitzer [Si II] infrared emission, suggesting that the\nemission is likely due to [Si I] line not [Fe II] line as in shocked material.\nThe structure of the optically-invisible western area of Cas A is clearly seen\nfor the first time.

This idea of the land-sea connectivity sounded reasonable\nfor many scientists because there is an obvious connection by rivers, however,\nquantitative estimation of this relationship has been thought to be difficult\ndue to the size of the target areas, the numbers of possible variables, and the\namount of noises in this complex system. In this study, we applied a sparse\nhigh-dimensional modeling to overcome these difficulties and found several\nsignificant land-sea linkages. In this modeling, the key is the penalization in\nthe number of independent variables, and thus a limited number of significant\nindependent variables are chosen in an objective and quantitative manner. We\nselected 448 independent variables (geological, biological, and social) and 68\ndependent variables (marine products) from a governmental database. Then we\nsummarized the data according to the political boundaries of 47 prefectures.\nThe sparse high-dimensional model we constructed successfully highlighted\nseveral significant variables to estimate the amount of marine products by\nprefecture. For example, we found that coastal, especially sessile marine\nproducts such as seaweed and shellfish had more explanatory variables than\nopen-water marine products such as tuna and sailfishes. In addition, salmon\nproduction had a strong connection to the mesoscale (prefecture-level)\nland-surface conditions possibly due to their interconnected life cycle between\nfreshwater rivers and the sea.

Here, I would like to provide a\npedagogical review explaining some of the main ideas, which were pivotal in\nestablishing topological matter as such an important subject. Specifically, I\nexplain how the integer quantum Hall state played the role as a prototype for\ntopological insulator, eventually leading to the concept of topological matter\nin general. The topological nature of the integer quantum Hall state is best\nrepresented by the Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs, or so-called TKNN\nformula, which connects between the Berry phase and the Hall conductivity. The\ntopological non-triviality of topological insulator stems from the existence of\na Dirac monopole in an appropriate, but often hidden Hamiltonian parameter\nspace. Interestingly, having the identical Dirac monopole structure, the\nHamiltonian describing the Rabi oscillation bears the essence of topological\ninsulator. The concept of topological matter has expanded to include\ntopological semimetals such as Weyl and Dirac semimetals. A final frontier in\nthe research of topological matter is the interaction-induced topological\nphases of matter, namely, the fractional Chern and topological insulators. The\nexistence of the fractional Chern and topological insulators has been proposed\ntheoretically by drawing an analogy from the fractional quantum Hall states.\nThe gist of this proposal is explained along with some of its issues.

Recently, deep learning-based approaches have\nbeen applied to biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) and showed\npromising results. However, as deep learning approaches need an abundant amount\nof training data, a lack of data can hinder performance. BioNER datasets are\nscarce resources and each dataset covers only a small subset of entity types.\nFurthermore, many bio entities are polysemous, which is one of the major\nobstacles in named entity recognition. Results: To address the lack of data and\nthe entity type misclassification problem, we propose CollaboNet which utilizes\na combination of multiple NER models. In CollaboNet, models trained on a\ndifferent dataset are connected to each other so that a target model obtains\ninformation from other collaborator models to reduce false positives. Every\nmodel is an expert on their target entity type and takes turns serving as a\ntarget and a collaborator model during training time.

We present abundances of\nBa (5057 stars), Eu (6268 stars), Gd (5431 stars), and Dy (5479 stars). We\nchemically characterize the thin and the thick discs, and a metal-rich\nalpha-rich population. We find that the [Eu/Fe] ratio follows a continuous\nsequence from the thin disc to the thick disc as a function of the metallicity.\nIn thick disc stars, the [Eu/Ba] ratio is found to be constant, while the\n[Gd/Ba] and [Dy/Ba] ratios decrease as a function of the metallicity. These\nobservations clearly indicate a different nucleosynthesis history in the thick\ndisc between Eu and Gd-Dy. We also find that the alpha-rich metal-rich stars\nare also enriched in r-process elements (like thick disc stars), but their\n[Ba/Fe] is very different from thick disc stars. Finally, we find that the\n[r/\\alpha] ratio tends to decrease with metallicity, indicating that supernovae\nof different properties probably contribute differently to the synthesis of\nr-process elements and \\alpha-elements. We provide average abundance trends for\n[Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] with rather small dispersions, and for the first time for\n[Gd/Fe] and [Dy/Fe]. This data may help to constrain chemical evolution models\nof Milky Way r- and s-process elements and the yields of massive stars.\nIncluding yields of neutron-star or black hole mergers is now crucial if we\nwant to quantitatively compare observations to Galactic chemical evolution\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 06:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Since the\nprecise statistical properties of neural activity are important in this\ncontext, many models assume an ad-hoc source of well-behaved, explicit noise,\neither on the input or on the output side of single neuron dynamics, most often\nassuming an independent Poisson process in either case. However, these\nassumptions are somewhat problematic: neighboring neurons tend to share\nreceptive fields, rendering both their input and their output correlated; at\nthe same time, neurons are known to behave largely deterministically, as a\nfunction of their membrane potential and conductance.

The CO molecule,\noften used a tracer of H2 through a conversion function, is selectively\nphotodissociated in dust-poor environments and, as a result, a potentially\nlarge fraction of H2 is expected to reside in the so-called CO-dark gas, where\nit could be traced instead by infrared cooling lines [CI], [CII], and [OI].\nAlthough the fraction of CO-dark gas to total molecular gas is expected to be\nrelatively large in metal-poor galaxies, many uncertainties remain due to the\ndifficulty in identifying the main heating mechanism associated to the cooling\nlines observed in such galaxies. Investigations of the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy\nSurvey show that the heating mechanism in the neutral gas of BCDs cannot be\ndominated by the photoelectric effect on dust grains below some threshold\nmetallicity, implying that other heating mechanisms need to be invoked, along\nwith a new interpretation of the corresponding infrared line diagnostics.

We derive stringent upper limits on the size of H2\nclumps that may be detected in the future with JWST and IRAM/NOEMA.

Within this coarse-grained model, we perform\nMonte Carlo simulations of mixtures of polymers and hard-nanosphere crowders,\nincluding trial changes in polymer size and shape. Penetration of polymers by\ncrowders is incorporated via a free energy cost predicted by polymer field\ntheory.

Comparison of results for polymers in\ngood and theta solvents indicates that excluded-volume interactions between\npolymer segments significantly affect crowding, especially in the limit of\ncrowders much smaller than polymers.

After the inflaton\ndecay, the model possesses approximate U(1)-invariance, explicitly broken by a\nsmall mass splitting. This splitting leads to the baryogenesis in the early\nUniverse. Resulting baryon asymmetry is automatically small for the scalars\nwith the masses about the Grand Unification scale and larger.

A\ncomparative study of the excluded volume (EV) and virial approaches for the\n$np\\alpha$ system using the equation of state of Akmal, Pandharipande and\nRavenhall for interacting nucleons is presented in the sub-nuclear density\nregime. Owing to the excluded volume of the $\\alpha$-particles, their mass\nfraction vanishes in the EV approach below the baryon density 0.1 fm$^{-3}$,\nwhereas it continues to rise due to the predominantly attractive interactions\nin the virial approach.

Its main goal is\nto seamlessly blend virtual content in real-world scenes. Due to the lack of\ncomputational power in mobile devices, rendering a virtual object with\nhigh-quality, coherent appearance and in real-time, remains an area of active\nresearch. In this work, we present a novel pipeline that allows for coupled\nenvironment acquisition and virtual object rendering on a mobile device\nequipped with a depth sensor. While keeping human interaction to a minimum, our\nsystem can scan a real scene and project it onto a two-dimensional environment\nmap containing RGB+Depth data. Furthermore, we define a set of criteria that\nallows for an adaptive update of the environment map to account for dynamic\nchanges in the scene. Then, under the assumption of diffuse surfaces and\ndistant illumination, our method exploits an analytic expression for the\nirradiance in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients, which leads to a very\nefficient rendering algorithm. We show that all the processes in our pipeline\ncan be executed while maintaining an average frame rate of 31Hz on a mobile\ndevice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 14:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

Nonlinear reconstruction\nalgorithms developed in recent years, when applied to late-time matter fields,\ncan recover to a substantial degree the initial density distribution, however,\nwhen applied to sparse tracers of the matter field, the performance is poorer.\nIn this paper we apply the Shi et al. non-linear reconstruction method to\nbiased tracers in order to establish what factors affect the reconstruction\nperformance.

Here we consider functional repair codes, where individual storage\nnodes that fail may be repaired efficiently and the ability to recover original\ndata and to further repair failed nodes is preserved. There are two predominant\napproaches to repair codes: a coding theoretic approach and a vector space\napproach. We explore the relationship between the two and frame the later in\nterms of projective geometry. We find that many of the constructions proposed\nin the literature can be seen to arise from natural and well-studied geometric\nobjects, and that this perspective gives a framework that provides\nopportunities for generalisations and new constructions that can lead to\ngreater flexibility in trade-offs between various desirable properties. We also\nframe the cut-set bound obtained from network coding in terms of projective\ngeometry. We explore the notion of strictly functional repair codes, for which\nthere exist nodes that cannot be replaced exactly. Currently only one known\nexample is given in the literature, due to Hollmann and Poh. We examine this\nphenomenon from a projective geometry point of view, and discuss how strict\nfunctionality can arise. Finally, we consider the issue that the view of a\nrepair code as a collection of sets of vector/projective subspaces is recursive\nin nature and makes it hard to visualise what a collection of nodes looks like\nand how one might approach a construction. Here we provide another view of\nusing directed graphs that gives us non-recursive criteria for determining\nwhether a family of collections of subspaces constitutes a function, exact, or\nstrictly functional repair code, which may be of use in searching for new codes\nwith desirable properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 14:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

We aim to segment brain tissue on\ninfant brain MRI at about 6 months of age where white matter and gray matter of\nthe developing brain show similar T1 and T2 relaxation times, thus appear to\nhave similar intensity values on both T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans. Brain\ntissue segmentation at this age is, therefore, very challenging. To this end,\nwe propose an exclusive multi-label training strategy to segment the mutually\nexclusive brain tissues with similarity loss functions that automatically\nbalance the training based on class prevalence. Using our proposed training\nstrategy based on similarity loss functions and patch prediction fusion we\ndecrease the number of parameters in the network, reduce the complexity of the\ntraining process focusing the attention on less number of tasks, while\nmitigating the effects of data imbalance between labels and inaccuracies near\npatch borders. By taking advantage of these strategies we were able to perform\nfast image segmentation (90 seconds per 3D volume), using a network with less\nparameters than many state-of-the-art networks, overcoming issues such as\n3Dvs2D training and large vs small patch size selection, while achieving the\ntop performance in segmenting brain tissue among all methods tested in first\nand second round submissions of the isointense infant brain MRI segmentation\n(iSeg) challenge according to the official challenge test results. Our proposed\nstrategy improves the training process through balanced training and by\nreducing its complexity while providing a trained model that works for any size\ninput image and is fast and more accurate than many state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 15:08:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:30:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 05:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

In this\npaper, we introduce Composer, a visual analysis tool for orthopedic surgeons to\ncompare changes in physical functions of a patient cohort following various\nspinal procedures. The goal of our project is to help researchers analyze\noutcomes of procedures and facilitate informed decision-making about treatment\noptions between patient and clinician. Methods: In collaboration with\nOrthopedic surgeons and researchers, we defined domain-specific user\nrequirements to inform the design. We developed the tool in an iterative\nprocess with our collaborators to develop and refine functionality. With\nComposer, analysts can dynamically define a patient cohort using demographic\ninformation, clinical parameters, and events in patient medical histories and\nthen analyze patient-reported outcome scores for the cohort over time, as well\nas compare it to other cohorts. Using Composer's current iteration, we provide\na usage scenario for use of the tool in a clinical setting. Conclusion: We have\ndeveloped a prototype cohort analysis tool to help clinicians assess patient\ntreatment options by analyzing prior cases with similar characteristics. Though\nComposer was designed using patient data specific to Orthopedic research, we\nbelieve the tool is generalizable to other healthcare domains. A long term goal\nfor Composer is to develop the application into a shared decision-making tool\nthat allows translation of comparison and analysis from a clinician facing\ninterface into visual representations to communicate treatment options to\npatients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 15:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

An example is a two-level system, that randomly\nfluctuates between two states with Boltzmann weights determined by an effective\ntemperature. To consider whether this description is physically reasonable, we\nstudy it in the simplest example of a quantum dot which is coupled to two\nelectronic reservoirs and to a single fluctuator. Averaging over the histories\nof the TN yields an inflow of energy flux from the fluctuator into the\nelectronic reservoirs, which persists even when the fluctuator's effective\ntemperature is equal to (or smaller than) the common reservoirs temperature.\nTherefore, the fuluctuator's temperature cannot represent a real environment.\nSince our formalism allows for any time dependent energy on the dot, we also\napply it to the case of a non-random electric field which oscillates\nperiodically in time. Averaging over a period of these oscillations yields\nresults which are very similar to those of the TN model, including the energy\nflow into the electronic reservoirs.

Findings\nindicate that these systems could be understood as large scale complex networks\nwith pronounced differences in centrality and connectivity among places and a\nhierarchical sequence of clusters across spatial scales from the overregional\nto the local level. Such properties in turn would influence the cohesion and\nrobustness of imperial networks, as is demonstrated with two tests on\nvulnerability to node failure and to the collapse of longdistance connectivity.\nTentatively, results can be connected with actual historical dynamics and thus\nhint at underlying network mechanisms of large scale integration and\ndisintegration of political formations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 14:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

The\nresults obtained from the relevance, endogeneity, overidentifying restrictions,\nand the Hausman's specification, tests indicate that the parameter estimates of\nthe six-factor model using IVGMM are robust and performs better than the OLS\napproach. The human capital component shares equally the predictive power\nalongside the factors in the framework in explaining the variations in return\non portfolios. Furthermore, we assess the t-ratio of the human capital\ncomponent of each IVGMM estimates of the six-factor asset pricing model for the\nfour sets of variant portfolios. The t-ratio of the human capital of the\neighty-three IVGMM estimates are more than 3.00 with reference to the standard\nproposed by Harvey et al. (2016). This indicates the empirical success of the\nsix-factor asset-pricing model in explaining the variation in asset returns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 14:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

Based on the detailed\nreview of multi-disciplinary literature, we propose a scenario that an event of\nnucleogenesis -- not nucleosynthesis (from lower nucleon numbers A to higher A)\nbut nuclear-fission (from higher A to lower A) -- occurred in the inner part of\nthe solar system at one of the stages of its evolution. We propose a feasible\nmechanism of implementation of such event. The occurrence of such event could\nhelp explain the puzzles in yet-unresolved isotopic abundances, certain\nmeteoritic anomalies, as well as peculiarities in the solar system's\ncomposition and planetary structure. We also discuss experimental data and\navailable results from existing models (in several relevant sub-fields) that\nprovide support and/or appear consistent with the hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 21:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 20:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Although currently under heavy development, the framework aims to\nallow the easy implementation of different design and optimization method\nfamilies (optimization algorithms, meta-heuristics, reinforcement learning\netc.) as well as the fair comparison between them. Furthermore, due to the\ncomputational resources required in order to optimize and evaluate network\narchitectures, it leverage the use of distributed computing, while aiming to\nminimize the researcher's overhead required to implement it. Moreover, it\nstrives to make the creation of architectures more intuitive, by implementing\nnetwork descriptors, allowing to separately define the architecture's nodes and\nconnections.

However, with\nmulti-layered networks, where multiple types of relationships exist for the\nsame set of nodes, it is crucial to exploit the information shared between\nlayers, in addition to the distinct aspects of each layer. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach that first obtains node embeddings in all layers\njointly via DeepWalk on a \\textit{supra} graph, which allows interactions\nbetween layers, and then fine-tunes the embeddings to encourage cohesive\nstructure in the latent space. With empirical studies in node classification,\nlink prediction and multi-layered community detection, we show that the\nproposed approach outperforms existing single- and multi-layered network\nembedding algorithms on several benchmarks. In addition to effectively scaling\nto a large number of layers (tested up to $37$), our approach consistently\nproduces highly modular community structure, even when compared to methods that\ndirectly optimize for the modularity function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 19:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 22:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}
