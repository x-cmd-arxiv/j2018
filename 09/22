We\nevaluated the performances of three widely adopted methods (pure geometrical\nfit, maximum likelihood approach, and a single stars fit) in recovering stellar\nparameters. Artificial OCs were generated by means of a Monte Carlo procedure\nfor two different ages (7.5 and 9.0 Gyr) and two different choices of the\nnumber of stars in the RGB evolutionary phase (35 and 80). The geometrical\napproach overestimated the age by about 0.3 and 0.2 Gyr for true ages of 7.5\nand 9.0 Gyr, respectively. The ML approach provided similar biases (0.1 and 0.2\nGyr) but with a variance reduced by a factor of between two and four with\nrespect to geometrical fit. The independent fit of single stars showed a very\nlarge variance. The most important difference between geometrical and ML\napproaches was the robustness against observational errors. For the geometrical\nmethod, we found that estimations starting from the same sample but with\ndifferent Gaussian perturbations on the observables had about 0.3 Gyr random\nvariability from one Monte Carlo run to another (45% of the intrinsic\nvariability due to observational errors). On the other hand, for the ML method,\nthis value was about 65% and 90% of the simulations failed to include the true\nparameter values in their estimated 1 sigma credible interval. Finally, we\ncompared the performance of the three fitting methods for single RGB-star age\nestimation.

This problem is particularly\ncritical at terahertz (THz) frequencies because high input power THz sources\nare not available. The demonstration of enhanced nonlinear effects at THz\nfrequencies is particularly important since these nonlinear mechanisms promise\nto play a significant role in the development and design of new reconfigurable\nplanar THz nonlinear devices. In this work, we present a novel class of\nultrathin nonlinear hybrid planar THz devices based on graphene-covered\nplasmonic gratings exhibiting very large nonlinear response. The robust\nlocalization and enhancement of the electric field along the graphene\nmonolayer, combined with the large nonlinear conductivity of graphene, can lead\nto boosted third harmonic generation (THG) and four-wave mixing (FWM) nonlinear\nprocesses at THz frequencies. These interesting nonlinear effects exhibit very\nhigh nonlinear conversion efficiencies and are triggered by realistic input\nintensities with relative low values. In addition, the THG and FWM processes\ncan be significantly tuned by the dimensions of the proposed hybrid structures,\nthe doping level of graphene, or the input intensity values, whereas the\nnonlinear radiated power remains relatively insensitive to the incident angle\nof the excitation source. The presented nonlinear hybrid graphene-covered\nplasmonic gratings have a relative simple geometry and can be used to realize\nefficient third-order THz effects with a limited fabrication complexity.\nSeveral new nonlinear THz devices are envisioned based on the proposed hybrid\nnonlinear structures, such as frequency generators, all-optical signal\nprocessors, and wave mixers.

This is not only an overly simplistic view of\nconversation but it is also emphatically different from the way humans converse\nby heavily relying on their background knowledge about the topic (as opposed to\nsimply relying on the previous sequence of utterances). For example, it is\ncommon for humans to (involuntarily) produce utterances which are copied or\nsuitably modified from background articles they have read about the topic. To\nfacilitate the development of such natural conversation models which mimic the\nhuman process of conversing, we create a new dataset containing movie chats\nwherein each response is explicitly generated by copying and/or modifying\nsentences from unstructured background knowledge such as plots, comments and\nreviews about the movie.

In the considered model, each IoBT sensor\nseeks to decide whether to transmit or not based on its utility. The utility of\neach sensor is expressed in terms of the redundancy of the data transmitted,\nthe secrecy capacity and the energy consumed. Due to the limited communication\nrange of the IoBT sensors and their uncertainty about the location of the\neavesdroppers, the problem is formulated as a graphical Bayesian game in which\nthe IoBT sensors are the players. Then, the utilities of the IoBT sensors are\nmodified to take into account the effect of activating each sensor on the\nutilities of its neighbors, in order to achieve better system performance. The\nmodified game is shown to be a Bayesian potential game, and a best response\nalgorithm that is guaranteed to find a Nash equilibrium of the game is\nproposed. Simulation results show the tradeoff between the information\ntransmitted by the IoBT sensors and the desired secrecy level. Simulation\nresults also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing\nthe energy consumed compared to the baseline in which all the IoBT sensors are\nactivated. The reduction in energy consumption reaches up to 98% compared to\nthe baseline, when the number of sensors is 5000.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 16:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-24"}

Specifically, we investigate the efficiency of various degree-biased\nrandom walk search strategies to locate items that are randomly hidden on a\nsubset of vertices of a random graph. Vertices at which items are hidden in the\nnetwork are chosen at random as well, though with probabilities that may depend\non degree. We pitch various hide and seek strategies against each other, and\ndetermine the efficiency of search strategies by computing the average number\nof hidden items that a searcher will uncover in a random walk of $n$ steps. Our\nanalysis is based on the cavity method for finite single instances of the\nproblem, and generalises previous work of De Bacco et al. [1] so as to cover\ndegree-biased random walks. We also extend the analysis to deal with the\nthermodynamic limit of infinite system size. We study a broad spectrum of\nfunctional forms for the degree bias of both the hiding and the search strategy\nand investigate the efficiency of families of search strategies for cases where\ntheir functional form is either matched or unmatched to that of the hiding\nstrategy. Our results are in excellent agreement with those of numerical\nsimulations. We propose two simple approximations for predicting efficient\nsearch strategies. One is based on an equilibrium analysis of the random walk\nsearch strategy. While not exact, it produces correct orders of magnitude for\nparameters characterising optimal search strategies. The second exploits the\nexistence of an effective drift in random walks on networks, and is expected to\nbe efficient in systems with low concentration of small degree nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 17:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

However, despite their baryon\ncontent being dominated by hot gas, these filaments have been an elusive target\nfor X-ray observations. Recently, detections of filaments in very deep (2.4\nMsec) observations with Chandra were reported around Abell 133 (z=0.0559). To\nverify these claims, we conducted a multi-object spectrographic campaign on the\nBaade 6.5m telescope around Abell 133; this resulted in a catalog of\n${\\sim}3000$ new redshift measurements, of which 254 are of galaxies near the\ncluster. We investigate the kinematic state of Abell 133 and identify the\nphysical locations of filamentary structure in the galaxy distribution.\nContrary to previous studies, we see no evidence that Abell 133 is dynamically\ndisturbed; we reject the hypothesis that there is a kinematically distinct\nsubgroup (p=0.28) and find no velocity offset between the central galaxy and\nthe cluster ($\\textrm{Z}_\\textrm{score}=0.041^{+0.111}_{-0.106}$). The spatial\ndistribution of galaxies traces the X-ray filaments, as confirmed by angular\ncross correlation with a significance of ${\\sim}5\\sigma$.

While naively one\nmight expect that supercooling could increase the strength of the transition to\nvery high values, for strong supercooling the Universe is no longer\nradiation-dominated and the vacuum energy of the unstable minimum of the\npotential dominates the expansion, which can jeopardize the successful\ncompletion of the phase transition. After providing a general treatment for the\nnucleation, growth and percolation of broken phase bubbles during a first-order\nphase transition that encompasses the case of significant supercooling, we\nstudy the conditions for successful bubble percolation and completion of the\nelectroweak phase transition in theories beyond the Standard Model featuring\npolynominal potentials. For such theories, these conditions set a lower bound\non the temperature of the transition. Since the plasma cannot be significantly\ndiluted, the resulting GW signal originates mostly from sound waves and\nturbulence in the plasma, rather than bubble collisions. We find the peak\nfrequency of the GW signal from the phase transition to be generically $f\n\\gtrsim 10^{-4}$ Hz. We also study the condition for GW production by sound\nwaves to be long-lasting (GW source active for approximately a Hubble time),\nshowing it is generally not fulfilled in concrete scenarios. Because of this\nthe sound wave GW signal could be weakened, with turbulence setting in earlier,\nresulting in a smaller overall GW signal as compared to current literature\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 16:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

We introduce a tensor network algorithm able to simulate\nthermal states of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems in the thermodynamic\nlimit. The method develops instances of projected entangled pair states and\nprojected entangled pair operators for this purpose. It is the key feature of\nthis algorithm to resemble the cooling down of the system from an infinite\ntemperature state until it reaches the desired finite-temperature regime. As a\nbenchmark we study the finite-temperature phase transition of the Ising model\non an infinite square lattice, for which we obtain remarkable agreement with\nthe exact solution. We then turn to study the finite-temperature Bose-Hubbard\nmodel in the limits of two (hard-core) and three bosonic modes per site.

However, within the exoplanet direct\nimaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a\nfrequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated\ncompleteness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a\nBayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a\nparameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated\nprobability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit\nas the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about\nthe detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about\nthe probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter\nis therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based\non their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and\nupper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than\nthe frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two\ndifferent cases: 1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use\nmodel comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and\n2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya.

Each client already\nhas some messages as side information and requests a particular unknown message\nfrom the server. All clients learn the coding matrix so that they can decode\nand retrieve their requested data. Our starting observation is that, learning\nthe coding matrix can pose privacy concerns: it may enable a client to infer\ninformation about the requests and side information of other clients. In this\npaper, we mitigate this privacy concern by allowing each client to have limited\naccess to the coding matrix. In particular, we design coding matrices so that\neach client needs only to learn some of (and not all) the rows to decode her\nrequested message. By means of two different privacy metrics, we first show\nthat this approach indeed increases the level of privacy. Based on this, we\npropose the use of $k$-limited-access schemes: given an index coding scheme\nthat employs $T$ transmissions, we create a $k$-limited-access scheme with\n$T_k\\geq T$ transmissions, and with the property that each client needs at most\n$k$ transmissions to decode her message. We derive upper and lower bounds on\n$T_k$ for all values of $k$, and develop deterministic designs for these\nschemes, which are universal, i.e., independent of the coding matrix. We show\nthat our schemes are order-optimal when either $k$ or $n$ is large. Moreover,\nwe propose heuristics that complement the universal schemes for the case when\nboth $n$ and $k$ are small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 18:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

During the\nprocess of gene expression, 95% of human genes can code for multiple proteins\ndue to alternative splicing. While most splice variants of a gene carry the\nsame function, variants within some key genes can have remarkably different\nroles. To bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype, condition- and\ntissue-specific models of metabolism have been constructed. However, current\nmetabolic models only include information at the gene level. Consequently, as\nrecently acknowledged by the scientific community, common situations where\nchanges in splice-isoform expression levels alter the metabolic outcome cannot\nbe modeled. Results: We here propose GEMsplice, the first method for the\nincorporation of splice-isoform expression data into genome-scale metabolic\nmodels. Using GEMsplice, we make full use of RNA-Seq quantitative expression\nprofiles to predict, for the first time, the effects of splice isoform-level\nchanges in the metabolism of 1455 patients with 31 different breast cancer\ntypes. We validate GEMsplice by generating cancer-versus-normal predictions on\nmetabolic pathways, and by comparing with gene-level approaches and available\nliterature on pathways affected by breast cancer. GEMsplice is freely available\nfor academic use at https://github.com/GEMsplice/GEMsplice_code.

It is perturbative\nwith respect to a weak time-dependent (TD) Hamiltonian term, but is\nnon-perturbative with respect to strong coupling to an electromagnetic\nenvironment, or to Coulomb or superconducting correlations. We derive unifying\nrelations between the current generated by coherent radiation or statistical\nmixture of radiations, superimposed on a dc voltage $V_{dc}$, and the\nout-of-equilibrium dc current which encodes the effects of interactions. Thus\nwe extend fully the lateral band-transmission picture, thus quantum\nsuperposition, to coherent many-body correlated states. This provides methods\nfor a determination of the carrier's charge q free from unknown parameters\nthrough the robustness of the Josephson-like frequency. Similar relations we\nhave derived for noise have allowed, recently, to determine the fractional\ncharge in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) within the Jain series (M.\nKapfer et al, Science 2018). The present theory allows for breakdown of\ninversion symmetry and for asymmetric rates for emission and absorption of\nradiations. This generates a photo-ratchet effect we exploit to propose a novel\nmethod to measure the charge $q$, as well as spectroscopical analysis of the\nout-of-equilibrium dc current and the third cumulant of non-gaussian\nstatistical radiations. We apply the theory to the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid\n(TLL), showing a counterintuitive feature: a lorentzian pulse superimposed on\n$V_{dc}$ can reduce the current compared to its dc value, at the same $V_{dc}$,\nquestioning the terminology \"photo-assisted\".

Dynamic games model a wide variety of\napplications in economics, defense, and energy systems.

As in the single-agent case, only very specialized dynamic\ngames can be solved exactly, and so approximation algorithms are required. This\npaper extends the differential dynamic programming algorithm from single-agent\ncontrol to the case of non-zero sum full-information dynamic games. The method\nworks by computing quadratic approximations to the dynamic programming\nequations. The approximation results in static quadratic games which are solved\nrecursively. Convergence is proved by showing that the algorithm iterates\nsufficiently close to iterates of Newton's method to inherit its convergence\nproperties.

Using\nGraphQL, clients define precise, nested data-requirements in typed queries,\nwhich are resolved by servers against (possibly multiple) backend systems, like\ndatabases, object storages, or other APIs. Clients receive only the data they\ncare about, in a single request. However, providers of existing REST(-like)\nAPIs need to implement additional GraphQL interfaces to enable these\nadvantages. We here assess the feasibility of automatically generating GraphQL\nwrappers for existing REST(-like) APIs. A wrapper, upon receiving GraphQL\nqueries, translates them to requests against the target API. We discuss the\nchallenges for creating such wrappers, including dealing with data sanitation,\nauthentication, or handling nested queries. We furthermore present a\nprototypical implementation of OASGraph. OASGraph takes as input an OpenAPI\nSpecification (OAS) describing an existing REST(-like) web API and generates a\nGraphQL wrapper for it. We evaluate OASGraph by running it, as well as an\nexisting open source alternative, against 959 publicly available OAS. This\nexperiment shows that OASGraph outperforms the existing alternative and is able\nto create a GraphQL wrapper for 89.5% of the APIs -- however, with limitations\nin many cases. A subsequent analysis of errors and warnings produced by\nOASGraph shows that missing or ambiguous information in the assessed OAS\nhinders creating complete wrappers. Finally, we present a use case of the IBM\nWatson Language Translator API that shows that small changes to an OAS allow\nOASGraph to generate more idiomatic and more expressive GraphQL wrappers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 21:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

In particular, in addition to the deep neural network (DNN) for\nthe solution, a second DNN is considered that represents the residual of the\nPDE. The residual is then combined with the mismatch in the given data of the\nsolution in order to formulate the loss function. This framework is effective\nbut is lacking uncertainty quantification of the solution due to the inherent\nrandomness in the data or due to the approximation limitations of the DNN\narchitecture. Here, we propose a new method with the objective of endowing the\nDNN with uncertainty quantification for both sources of uncertainty, i.e., the\nparametric uncertainty and the approximation uncertainty. We first account for\nthe parametric uncertainty when the parameter in the differential equation is\nrepresented as a stochastic process. Multiple DNNs are designed to learn the\nmodal functions of the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion of its\nsolution by using stochastic data from sparse sensors. We can then make\npredictions from new sensor measurements very efficiently with the trained\nDNNs. Moreover, we employ dropout to correct the over-fitting and also to\nquantify the uncertainty of DNNs in approximating the modal functions. We then\ndesign an active learning strategy based on the dropout uncertainty to place\nnew sensors in the domain to improve the predictions of DNNs. Several numerical\ntests are conducted for both the forward and the inverse problems to quantify\nthe effectiveness of PINNs combined with uncertainty quantification. This\nNN-aPC new paradigm of physics-informed deep learning with uncertainty\nquantification can be readily applied to other types of stochastic PDEs in\nmulti-dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 21:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In our formulation, the attacker minimizes its visibility,\ndefined as the system $L_2$ gain from the attack signals to the deployed\nsensors' outputs, and the detector maximizes the visibility of the attack\nsignals.

These constraints and\nnorms can come from any number of sources including regulations, business\nprocess guidelines, laws, ethical principles, social norms, and moral values.\nWe detail a novel approach that uses inverse reinforcement learning to learn a\nset of unspecified constraints from demonstrations of the task, and\nreinforcement learning to learn to maximize the environment rewards.

The contextual bandit\norchestrator allows the agent to mix policies in novel ways, taking the best\nactions from either a reward maximizing or constrained policy. In addition, the\norchestrator is transparent on which policy is being employed at each time\nstep.

When this side information is in the form of item-item\ncorrelation matrices or graphs, existing CMTF algorithms may fall short.\nAlleviating current limitations, we introduce a novel model coined coupled\ngraph-tensor factorization (CGTF) that judiciously accounts for graph-related\nside information. The CGTF model has the potential to overcome practical\nchallenges, such as missing slabs from the tensor and/or missing rows/columns\nfrom the correlation matrices. A novel alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) is also developed that recovers the nonnegative factors of\nCGTF. Our algorithm enjoys closed-form updates that result in reduced\ncomputational complexity and allow for convergence claims. A novel direction is\nfurther explored by employing the interpretable factors to detect graph\ncommunities having the tensor as side information. The resulting community\ndetection approach is successful even when some links in the graphs are\nmissing. Results with real data sets corroborate the merits of the proposed\nmethods relative to state-of-the-art competing factorization techniques in\nproviding recommendations and detecting communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 00:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 17:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

The major\nresults are two innovative representations of the coverage probability, which\nmake the analysis of multi-antenna networks almost as tractable as the\nsingle-antenna case.

At mmWave, signals are prone to blockage by objects in the\nenvironment, including human bodies. Most mmWave systems utilize directional\nantennas in order to overcome the significant path loss. In this paper, we\nconsider the effects of blockage and antenna directivity on the performance of\na mmWave WPAN. Similar to related work, we assume that the interferers are in\narbitrary locations and the blockages are drawn from a random point process.\nHowever, unlike related work that assumes independent blocking, we carefully\naccount for the possibility of correlated blocking, which arises when two\ninterferers are close to each other and therefore an obstruction that blocks\nthe first interferer may likely block the second interferer. Closed form\nexpressions for the blockage correlation coefficient and the distribution of\nthe SINR are provided for the case of two dominant interferers and a fixed\nnumber of blockages drawn from a binomial point process. Finally, the effects\nof antenna directivity and the spatial randomness of the interferers are taken\ninto account, resulting in SINR curves that fully account for correlated\nblocking, which are compared against curves that neglect correlation. The\nresults provide insight into the validity of the commonly held assumption of\nindependent blocking and the improved accuracy that can be obtained when the\nblocking correlation is taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 02:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

We analyzed\nthe planetary radii and orbital periods of over 2800 $Kepler$ candidates from\nthe latest $Kepler$ data release DR25 (Q1-Q17) with revised planetary radii\nbased on $Gaia$~DR2 as a function of host star metallicity (from the Q1-Q17\n(DR25) stellar and planet catalog). With a much larger sample and improved\nradius measurements, we are able to reconfirm previous results in the\nliterature. We show that the average metallicity of the host star increases as\nthe radius of the planet increases. We demonstrate this by first calculating\nthe average host star metallicity for different radius bins and then\nsupplementing these results by calculating the occurrence rate as a function of\nplanetary radius and host star metallicity. We find a similar trend between\nhost star metallicity and planet mass: the average host star metallicity\nincreases with increasing planet mass. This trend, however, reverses for masses\n$> 4.0\\, M_\\mathrm{J}$: host star metallicity drops with increasing planetary\nmass. We further examined the correlation between the host star metallicity and\nthe orbital period of the planet. We find that for planets with orbital periods\nless than 10 days, the average metallicity of the host star is higher than that\nfor planets with periods greater than 10 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 05:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

The optimal control problem is solved using the\nLagrange variational technique that results in a set of adjoint equations, used\nto obtain the optimal wall actuation (blowing and suction from a control slot\nlocated in the transition region). The receding horizon approach enables the\napplication of control action over a longer time period, and allows the\nextraction of time-averaged statistics as well as investigation of the control\neffect downstream of the control slot. The results show that the controlled\nflow energy is initially reduced in the streamwise direction and then increased\nbecause transition still occurs. The distribution of the optimal control\nvelocity responds to the flow activity above and upstream of the control slot.\nThe control effect propagates downstream of the slot and the flow energy is\nreduced up to the exit of the computational domain. The mean drag reduction is\n55% and 10% in the control region and downstream of the slot, respectively. The\ncontrol mechanism is investigated by examining the second order statistics and\nthe two-point correlations. It is found that in the upstream (left) side of the\nslot, the controller counteracts the near wall high speed streaks and reduces\nthe turbulent shear stress; this is akin to opposition control in channel flow,\nand since the time-average control velocity is positive, it is more similar to\nblowing-only opposition control. In the downstream (right) side of the slot,\nthe controller reacts to the impingement of turbulent spots that have been\nproduced upstream and inside the boundary layer (top-bottom mechanism). The\ncontrol velocity is positive and increases in the streamwise direction, and the\nflow behavior is similar to that of uniform blowing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 06:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

Here we\ncontribute to resolving these questions by comparing features of the first half\nof a text (from the beginning to the middle) to its second half. This\ncomparison can uncover hidden effects, because the halves have the same values\nof many parameters (style, genre, author's vocabulary {\\it etc}).

The restoration is actively supervised by requesting the\ntrue values of certain pixels after a noisy observation. This additional\ninformation improves restoration of other pixels. The optimal strategy of\nactive inference is not known for realistic (two-dimensional) images.

After RNKN is efficiently trained from manually\nannotated Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs), diagnosis-oriented\nknowledge embeddings and weight matrixes are learned. Experimental results\nverify that the diagnostic accuracy of RNKN is superior to that of some\nclassical machine learning models and Markov logic network (MLN). The results\nalso demonstrate that the more explicit the evidence extracted from CEMRs is,\nthe better is the performance achieved. RNKN gradually exhibits the\ninterpretation of knowledge embeddings as the number of training epochs\nincreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 10:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

In order to deal with the risk of privacy leakage of images, images\nare typically encrypted before they are outsourced to the cloud, which makes\nCBIR an extremely challenging task.

Resulting thermodynamics is however unusual because a second entropy,\nH, measures a typically social feature, inequality or diversity in the\ndistribution of available resources. A symmetry phase transition takes place at\nGini values 1/3, where realistic distributions become asymmetric. Four\nconstraints act on S: expectedly, N and W, and new ones, diversity and\ninteractions between individuals; the latter result from the two coordinates of\na single point in the data, the peak. The occupation number of a job is either\nzero or one, suggesting Fermi-Dirac statistics for employment. Contrariwise, an\nindefinite nujmber of individuals can occupy a state defined as a quantile of\nincome or of age, so Bose-Einstein statistics may be required.\nIndistinguishability rather than anonymity of individuals and resources is thus\nneeded. Interactions between individuals define define classes of equivalence\nthat happen to coincide with acceptable definitions of social classes or\nperiods in human life. The entropy S is non-extensive and obtainable from data.\nTheoretical laws are compared to data in four different cases of economical or\nphysiological diversity. Acceptable fits are found for all of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 00:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

The analysis of such D2D caching networks based on a physical\ninterference model is usually carried out by assuming that devices are\nuniformly distributed. However, this approach does not fully consider and\ncharacterize the fact that devices are usually grouped into clusters. Motivated\nby this fact, this paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis and\njoint communication and caching optimization for a clustered D2D network.\nDevices are distributed according to a Thomas cluster process (TCP) and are\nassumed to have a surplus memory which is exploited to proactively cache files\nfrom a known library, following a random probabilistic caching scheme. Devices\ncan retrieve the requested files from their caches, from neighbouring devices\nin their proximity (cluster), or from the base station as a last resort. Three\nkey performance metrics are optimized in this paper, namely, the offloading\ngain, energy consumption, and latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 06:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

Two experiments involving testing over 17000 networks were conducted.\nThe first experiment was aimed at comparing the accuracy of shallow neural\nnetworks and DNNs predictions. It shows that when the experimental dataset used\nfor preparing models is small then DNNs have a significant advantage over\nshallow networks. The second experiment was conducted to compare the\nperformance of DNNs consisting of different number of neurons and layers.\nObtained results indicate that the optimal number of layers varies between 5 to\n7. Networks with less and - surprisingly - more layers obtain lower accuracy.\nMoreover, the number of neurons in DNN has a lower impact on the prediction\naccuracy than the number of DNN's layers. DNNs perform very well, even when\ntrained with only 6 samples. Basing on the results it seems that when\npredicting the ultimate bearing capacity with ANN models obtaining small but\nhigh-quality experimental training datasets instead of large training datasets\naffected by a higher error is an advisable approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 11:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

These implementation efforts have generally focused on\nweight multiplication and signal summation operations, and less on activation\nfunctions used in these applications. Yet, efficient hardware implementations\nof nonlinear activation functions like Exponential Linear Units (ELU), Scaled\nExponential Linear Units (SELU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh), are central to\ndesigning effective neural network accelerators, since these functions require\nlots of resources. In this paper, we explore efficient hardware implementations\nof activation functions using purely combinational circuits, with a focus on\ntwo widely used nonlinear activation functions, i.e., SELU and tanh. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that neural networks are generally insensitive to the\nprecision of the activation function. The results also prove that the proposed\ncombinational circuit-based approach is very efficient in terms of speed and\narea, with negligible accuracy loss on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and IMAGENET\nbenchmarks. Synopsys Design Compiler synthesis results show that circuit\ndesigns for tanh and SELU can save between 3.13-7.69 and 4.45-8:45 area\ncompared to the LUT/memory-based implementations, and can operate at 5.14GHz\nand 4.52GHz using the 28nm SVT library, respectively.
