One of\nthe most basic HOS methods is the bispectral estimation, which extracts the\ndegree of quadratic phase coupling between individual frequency components of a\nnonlinear signal. Most of the studies in this direction as applied to ECG\nsignals are on the conventional, long duration (up to 24 hours) Heart Rate\nVariability (HRV) data. We report results of our studies on short duration ECG\ndata of 60 seconds using power spectral and bispectral parameters. We analyze\n60 healthy cases and 60 cases of patients diagnosed with four different heart\ndiseases, Bundle Branch Block, Cardiomyopathy, Dysrhythmia and Myocardial\nInfarction. From the power spectra of these data sets we observe that the pulse\nfrequency around 1 Hz has maximum power for all normal ECG data while in all\ndisease cases, the power in the pulse frequency is suppressed and gets\ndistributed among higher frequencies. The bicoherence indices computed show\nthat the pulse frequency has strong quadratic phase coupling with a large\nnumber of higher frequencies in healthy cases indicating nonlinearity in the\nunderlying dynamical processes. The loss or decrease of the phase coupling with\npulse frequency is a clear indicator of abnormal conditions. In specific cases,\nbicoherence studies coupled with spectral filter, suggest ECG for Myocardial\nInfarction has noisy components while in Dysrhythmia, power is mostly at high\nfrequencies with strong quadratic coupling indicating much more irregularity\nand complexity than normal ECG signals. In addition to serving as indicators\nsuggestive of abnormal conditions of the heart, the detailed analysis presented\ncan lead to a wholistic understanding of normal heart dynamics and its\nvariations during onset of diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 16:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

The decision is made by a fusion center and is based on\nreceived data from the sensors. We focus on a spectrum and energy efficient\ntransmission scheme used to reduce the spectrum usage and energy consumption\nduring the detection task. We propose a Spectrum and Energy Efficient Multiple\nAccess (SEEMA) transmission protocol that performs a censoring-type\ntransmission based on the density of observations using multiple access\nchannels (MAC). Specifically, in SEEMA, only sensors with highly informative\nobservations transmit their data in each data collection. The sensors transmit\na common shaping waveform and the fusion center receives a superposition of the\nanalog transmitted signals. SEEMA has important advantages for detection tasks\nin WSNs. First, it is highly energy and bandwidth efficient due to transmission\nsavings and narrowband transmission over MAC. Second, it can be implemented by\nsimple dumb sensors (oblivious to observation statistics, and local data\nprocessing is not required) which simplifies the implementation as compared to\nexisting MAC transmission schemes for detection in WSNs. We establish a finite\nsample analysis and an asymptotic analysis of the error probability with\nrespect to the network size and provide system design conditions to obtain the\nexponential decay of the error. Specific performance analysis is developed for\ncommon non-i.i.d. observation scenarios, including local i.i.d. observations,\nand Markovian correlated observations.

Existing ranking systems can provide a baseline for\nselecting which updates or alerts to push to emergency responders. However,\nprior research has not investigated in depth how many and how often should\nthese updates be generated, considering a given bound on the workload for a\nuser due to the limited budget of attention in this stressful work environment.\nThis paper presents a novel problem and a model to quantify the relationship\nbetween the performance metrics of ranking systems (e.g., recall, NDCG) and the\nbounds on the user workload. We then synthesize an alert-based ranking system\nthat enforces these bounds to avoid overwhelming end-users. We propose a Pareto\noptimal algorithm for ranking selection that adaptively determines the\npreference of top-k ranking and user workload over time. We demonstrate the\napplicability of this approach for Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) by\nperforming an evaluation based on real world data from six crisis events.

Tipler further showed that if this property of CBR has\ncontinued, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect would be observed to be too low\nby a factor of two. WMAP and PLANCK observed this. Tipler showed that this CBR\nproperty would also mean the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) would\npropagate a factor of ten further than standard theory predicts, since most of\nthe cross section for pion production when a UHECR hits a CBR photon is due to\na quark spin flip, and such a flip cannot occur if a CBR particle cannot couple\nto right-handed quarks.

With improved model\nstructure, training loss, batch normalization and additional input channel,\nSqueezeSegV2 achieves significant accuracy improvement when trained on real\ndata. Training models for point cloud segmentation requires large amounts of\nlabeled point-cloud data, which is expensive to obtain. To sidestep the cost of\ncollection and annotation, simulators such as GTA-V can be used to create\nunlimited amounts of labeled, synthetic data. However, due to domain shift,\nmodels trained on synthetic data often do not generalize well to the real\nworld.

We consider stability within the sagittal\nplane and model the dynamics of running as a two-dimensional body with an\nalternating aerial and stance phase. Stance is modeled as a passive, impulsive\ncollision followed by an active, impulsive push-off that compensates for\ncollisional losses. Such a runner has infinitely many strategies to maintain\nperiodic gaits on flat ground. However, these strategies differ in how\nperturbations due to terrain unevenness are propagated. Instabilities manifest\nas tumbling (orientational instability) or failing to maintain a steady speed\n(translational instability). We find that open-loop strategies that avoid\nsensory feedback are sufficient to maintain stability on step-like terrains\nwith piecewise flat surfaces that randomly vary in height. However, these\nopen-loop runners lose orientational stability on rough terrains whose slope\nand height vary randomly. Only by avoiding tangential collisions is\norientational stability recovered. Tangential collisions may be avoided through\nleg-retraction to match foot and ground speed at touch down. By analyzing the\npropagation of perturbations, we derive a single dimensionless parameter that\ngoverns stability and guides the design and control of both biological and\nrobotic runners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 01:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

The abuse of slave-particle method may lead to wrong\nphysics.

In this work, we will uncover the nature of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin method by studying a two-site Hubbard model.

Furthermore, in the parameter space where both $U$ and\n$T$ are small enough, slave-spin mean-field method is also reliable in\ncalculating dynamic and thermal dynamic properties. However, when $U$ or $T$ is\nconsiderably large, the mean-field approximation gives ill-defined behavior,\nwhich results from the unphysical states in enlarged Hilbert space.

Our calculations reveal the\nimportance of the bound-free transitions on the lifetime calculations and a\nlarge difference of about a factor of three between the $J=1$ and $J=31$ for\nthe $v=40$ and $v=100$, due to the wavefunction alternating between having\npredominantly inner and outer well amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 05:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

By analyzing the induced\ncharge density associated with the J-band, we conclude that it is a\nlongitudinal excitation, delocalized along parallel linear chains and that its\noverall red shift results from competing coupling mechanisms, some giving red\nshift and others giving blue shift, which derive from both coupling between\ntransition densities and renormalization of the single-particle energy levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 09:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

Exclusion limits at 95% confidence\nlevel are set on the product of the production cross section and branching\nfraction as a function of the vector-like quark mass, which range from 0.3 to\n0.03 pb for vector-like quark masses of 700 to 2000 GeV. Mass exclusion limits\nup to 1660 GeV are obtained, depending on the vector-like quark type, coupling,\nand decay width. These represent the most stringent exclusion limits for the\nsingle production of vector-like quarks in this channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 13:41:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 20:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Here, we use sub-10 meV electron energy\nloss spectroscopy to investigate the local vibrational properties at surface\nand interface of an amorphous SiO$_2$ (a-SiO$_2$) thin film on Si substrate. We\nfind that each optical mode splits into three sub-modes, i.e., surface mode,\nbulk mode and interface mode, which can be measured from different locations.\nThe pure surface modes can be measured in the vacuum near the surface, and the\npure interface modes are expected to be obtained either at the interface\nlocation or in the Si, while inside the SiO$_2$ the measured signal is a\nmixture of bulk, surface, and interface modes. The bulk mode has the largest\nvibration energy and surface mode has the lowest. The energy of surface mode is\nthickness dependent, showing a blue-shift as z-thickness (parallel to fast\nelectron beam) of SiO$_2$ film increases, while the bulk and interface modes\nhave constant vibration energy. The intensity of bulk mode linearly increases\nwith thickness being increased, and it drops steeply to zero near the surface\nand interface (within a few nanometers). The surface modes decay slowly in the\nvacuum following a Bessel function. The mechanism of the observed spatially\ndependent vibration behavior is discussed and quantitatively compared with\ndielectric response theory analysis. Our nanometer scale measurements of\nvibrations properties provide useful information about the bonding conditions\nat the surface and interface and thus may help to design better silicon-based\nelectronic devices via surface and interface treatments\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 15:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 14:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

A promising approach to address these two requirements is to enable\nmobile edge devices to share their communication, computation, and caching (3C)\nresources via device-to-device (D2D) connections. In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral 3C resource sharing framework, which includes many existing 1C/2C\nsharing models in the literature as special cases. Comparing with 1C/2C models,\nthe proposed 3C framework can further improve the resource utilization\nefficiency by offering more flexibilities in the device cooperation and\nresource scheduling. As a typical example, we focus on the energy utilization\nunder the proposed 3C framework. Specifically, we formulate an energy\nconsumption minimization problem under the 3C framework, which is an integer\nnon-convex optimization problem. To solve the problem, we first transform it\ninto an equivalent integer linear programming problem that is much easier to\nsolve. Then, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on linear programming,\nwhich can further reduce the computation time and produce a result that is\nempirically close to the optimal solution. Moreover, we evaluate the energy\nreduction due to the 3C sharing both analytically and numerically. Numerical\nresults show that, comparing with the existing 1C/2C approaches, the proposed\n3C sharing framework can reduce the total energy consumption by 83.8% when the\nD2D energy is negligible. The energy reduction is still 27.5% when the D2D\ntransmission energy per unit time is twice as large as the cellular\ntransmission energy per unit time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2018 17:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}
