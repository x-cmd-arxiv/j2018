For example, robotics is used to increase productivity while reducing\ncosts in various aspects of manufacturing. Since robots are often set up in\nproduction lines, the breakdown of a single robot has a negative impact on the\nentire process, in the worst case bringing the whole line to a halt until the\nissue is resolved, leading to substantial financial losses due to the\nunforeseen downtime. Therefore, predictive maintenance systems based on the\ninternal signals of robots have gained attention as an essential component of\nrobotics service offerings. The main shortcoming of existing predictive\nmaintenance algorithms is that the extracted features typically differ\nsignificantly from the learnt model when the operation of the robot changes,\nincurring false alarms. In order to mitigate this problem, predictive\nmaintenance algorithms require the model to be retrained with normal data of\nthe new operation. In this paper, we propose a novel solution based on transfer\nlearning to pass the knowledge of the trained model from one operation to\nanother in order to prevent the need for retraining and to eliminate such false\nalarms. The deployment of the proposed unsupervised transfer learning algorithm\non real-world datasets demonstrates that the algorithm can not only distinguish\nbetween operation and mechanical condition change, it further yields a sharper\ndeviation from the trained model in case of a mechanical condition change and\nthus detects mechanical issues with higher confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 16:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 15:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 19:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

We show that these algorithms can cut down DRAM access\nlatency by up to 55% depending on the algorithm used. The benefit gained from\nthe algorithms is dependent upon their complexity.

The interface allows three human subjects to collaborate and solve a\ntask using direct brain-to-brain communication. Two of the three subjects are\n\"Senders\" whose brain signals are decoded using real-time EEG data analysis to\nextract decisions about whether to rotate a block in a Tetris-like game before\nit is dropped to fill a line. The Senders' decisions are transmitted via the\nInternet to the brain of a third subject, the \"Receiver,\" who cannot see the\ngame screen. The decisions are delivered to the Receiver's brain via magnetic\nstimulation of the occipital cortex. The Receiver integrates the information\nreceived and makes a decision using an EEG interface about either turning the\nblock or keeping it in the same position. A second round of the game gives the\nSenders one more chance to validate and provide feedback to the Receiver's\naction. We evaluated the performance of BrainNet in terms of (1) Group-level\nperformance during the game; (2) True/False positive rates of subjects'\ndecisions; (3) Mutual information between subjects. Five groups of three\nsubjects successfully used BrainNet to perform the Tetris task, with an average\naccuracy of 0.813.

The natural variability\nof streamflow is being complicated by anthropogenic influences and climate\nchange, which may introduce additional complexity into the phenomenological\nrecords. To address this question for daily discharge data recorded during the\nperiod 1989-2016 at twelve gauging stations on Brazos River in Texas (USA), we\nuse a set of novel quantitative tools: Kolmogorov complexity (KC) with its\nderivative associated measures to assess complexity, and Lyapunov time (LT) to\nassess predictability. We find that all daily discharge series exhibit long\nmemory with an increasing downflow tendency, while the randomness of the series\nat individual sites cannot be definitively concluded. All Kolmogorov complexity\nmeasures have relatively small values with the exception of the USGS (United\nStates Geological Survey) 08088610 station at Graford, Texas, which exhibits\nthe highest values of these complexity measures. This finding may be attributed\nto the elevated effect of human activities at Graford, and proportionally\nlesser effect at other stations. In addition, complexity tends to decrease\ndownflow, meaning that larger catchments are generally less influenced by\nanthropogenic activity. The correction on randomness of Lyapunov time\n(quantifying predictability) is found to be inversely proportional to the\nKolmogorov complexity, which strengthens our conclusion regarding the effect of\nanthropogenic activities, considering that KC and LT are distinct measures,\nbased on rather different techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 17:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

In the first\nstep of the process, Combinatorial Equilibrium Modelling (CEM) is used to\ngenerate a large variety of spatial networks in equilibrium for given input\nparameters. In the second step, these networks are clustered and represented in\na form-map through the implementation of a Self Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm.\nIn the third step, the solution space is interpreted with the help of a Uniform\nManifold Approximation and Projection algorithm (UMAP). This allows gaining\nimportant insights in the structure of the solution space. A specific case\nstudy is used to illustrate how the infinite equilibrium states of a given\ntopology can be defined and represented by clusters. Furthermore, three\nclasses, related to the non-linear interaction between the input parameters and\nthe form space, are verified and a statement about the entire manifold of the\nsolution space of the case study is made.

SCS admits $2\\frac{11}{23}$-approximation in polynomial time (Mucha,\nSODA'13). While this algorithm and its analysis are technically involved, the\n30 years old Greedy Conjecture claims that the trivial and efficient Greedy\nAlgorithm gives a 2-approximation for SCS.\n  We develop a graph-theoretic framework for studying approximation algorithms\nfor SCS. The framework is reminiscent of the classical 2-approximation for\nTraveling Salesman: take two copies of an optimal solution, apply a trivial\nedge-collapsing procedure, and get an approximate solution. In this framework,\nwe observe two surprising properties of SCS solutions, and we conjecture that\nthey hold for all input instances. The first conjecture, that we call\nCollapsing Superstring conjecture, claims that there is an elementary way to\ntransform any solution repeated twice into the same graph $G$. This conjecture\nwould give an elementary 2-approximate algorithm for SCS. The second conjecture\nclaims that not only the resulting graph $G$ is the same for all solutions, but\nthat $G$ can be computed by an elementary greedy procedure called Greedy\nHierarchical Algorithm.\n  While the second conjecture clearly implies the first one, perhaps\nsurprisingly we prove their equivalence. We support these equivalent\nconjectures by giving a proof for the special case where all input strings have\nlength at most 3. We prove that the standard Greedy Conjecture implies Greedy\nHierarchical Conjecture, while the latter is sufficient for an efficient greedy\n2-approximate approximation of SCS.

The\nvelocity field is solved by the recently developed multiple-relaxation-time\n(MRT) LB equation for density distribution function (DF), by which a\nself-tuning EOS can be recovered. As to the temperature field, a novel MRT LB\nequation for total energy DF is directly developed at the discrete level. By\nintroducing a density-DF-related term into this LB equation and devising the\nequilibrium moment function for total energy DF, the viscous dissipation and\ncompression work are consistently considered, and by modifying the collision\nmatrix, the targeted energy conservation equation is recovered without\ndeviation term. The full coupling of thermo-hydrodynamic effects is achieved\nvia the self-tuning EOS and the viscous dissipation and compression work. The\npresent LB model is developed on the basis of the standard lattice, and various\nEOSs can be adopted in real applications. Moreover, both the Prandtl number and\nspecific heat ratio can be arbitrarily adjusted. Furthermore, boundary\ncondition treatment is also proposed on the basis of the judicious\ndecomposition of DF into its equilibrium, force (source), and nonequilibrium\nparts. The local conservation of mass, momentum, and energy can be strictly\nsatisfied at the boundary node. Numerical simulations of thermal Poiseuille and\nCouette flows are carried out with three different EOSs, and the numerical\nresults are in good agreement with the analytical solutions. Then, natural\nconvection in a square cavity with a large temperature difference is simulated\nfor the Rayleigh number from $10^3$ up to $10^8$. Good agreement between the\npresent and previous numerical results is observed, which further validates the\npresent LB model for coupled thermo-hydrodynamic flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 21:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

By using the unusual good Fourier\ntransform of the zero sphere in some specific dimensions, which has been\ndiscovered recently in the work of Iosevich, Lee, Shen, and the first and\nsecond listed authors (2018), we provide a new $L^2\\to L^r$ extension estimate\nfor paraboloids in dimensions $d=4k+3$ and $q\\equiv 3\\mod 4$, which improves\nsignificantly the recent exponent obtained by the first listed author. In the\ncase of spheres, we introduce a way of using \\textit{the first association\nscheme graph} to analyze energy sets, and as a consequence, we obtain new\n$L^p\\to L^4$ extension theorems for spheres of primitive radii in odd\ndimensions, which break the Stein-Tomas result toward $L^p\\to L^4$ which has\nstood for more than ten years. Most significantly, it follows from the results\nfor spheres that there exists a different extension phenomenon between spheres\nand paraboloids in odd dimensions, namely, the $L^p\\to L^4$ estimates for\nspheres with primitive radii are much stronger than those for paraboloids.\nBased on new estimates, we will also clarify conjectures on finite field\nextension problem for spheres. This results in a reasonably complete\ndescription of finite field extension theorems for spheres. The second purpose\nis to show that there is a connection between the restriction conjecture\nassociated to paraboloids and the Erd\\H{o}s-Falconer distance conjecture over\nfinite fields. The last is to prove that the Erd\\H{o}s-Falconer distance\nconjecture holds in odd-dimensional spaces when we study distances between two\nsets: one set lies on a variety (paraboloids or spheres), and the other set is\narbitrary in $\\mathbb{F}_q^d$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2018 23:57:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 16:53:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 17:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 23:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 01:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 22:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 13:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 12:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 15:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

Associated with these conditions are strong\nvariations in thermo-transport properties as the fluid undergoes phase\ntransition, and two-stage ignition with low-temperature combustion. Accurately\nsimulating these physical phenomena at real-fluid environments remains a\nchallenge. By addressing this issue, a high-fidelity LES-modeling framework is\ndeveloped to conduct simulations of transcritical fuel spray mixing and\nauto-ignition at high-pressure conditions. The simulation is based on a\nrecently developed diffused interface method that solves the compressible\nmulti-species conservation equations along with a Peng-Robinson state equation\nand real-fluid transport properties. LES analysis is performed for non-reacting\nand reacting spray conditions targeting the ECN Spray A configuration at\nchamber conditions with a pressure of 60 bar and temperatures between 900 K and\n1200 K to investigate effects of the real-fluid environment and low-temperature\nchemistry.

Good\nagreement of the ignition delay time and the lift-off length is obtained from\nsimulation results at different ambient temperature conditions and the\nformation of intermediate species is captured by the simulations, indicating\nthat the presented numerical framework adequately reproduces the corresponding\nlow- and high-temperature ignition processes under high-pressure conditions,\nwhich are relevant to realistic diesel-fuel injection systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 01:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

As such, the TLS\nproxy must implement both a TLS client and a server, and handle a large amount\nof traffic, preferably, in real-time. However, as protocol and implementation\nlayer vulnerabilities in TLS/HTTPS are quite frequent, these proxies must be,\nat least, as secure as a modern, up-to-date web browser, and a properly\nconfigured web server.

Over the past two decade, it\nhas been recognized that advanced image processing techniques provide valuable\ninformation to physicians for diagnosis, image guided therapy and surgery, and\nmonitoring of the treated organ to the therapy. Many researchers and companies\nhave invested significant efforts in the developments of advanced medical image\nanalysis methods; especially in the two core studies of medical image\nsegmentation and registration, segmentations of organs and lesions are used to\nquantify volumes and shapes used in diagnosis and monitoring treatment;\nregistration of multimodality images of organs improves detection, diagnosis\nand staging of diseases as well as image-guided surgery and therapy,\nregistration of images obtained from the same modality are used to monitor\nprogression of therapy.

This places tight constraints on dark energy models constructed in\nthe framework of modified gravitational theories. We review models of the\nlate-time cosmic acceleration in scalar-tensor theories with second-order\nequations of motion (dubbed Horndeski theories) by paying particular attention\nto the evolution of dark energy equation of state and observables relevant to\nthe cosmic growth history. We provide a gauge-ready formulation of scalar\nperturbations in full Horndeski theories and estimate observables associated\nwith the evolution of large-scale structures, cosmic microwave background, and\nweak lensing by employing a so-called quasi-static approximation for the modes\ndeep inside the sound horizon.\n  In light of the recent observational bound of $c_t$, we also classify\nsurviving dark energy models into four classes depending on different\nstructure-formation patterns and discuss how they can be observationally\ndistinguished from each other. In particular, the nonminimally coupled theories\nin which the scalar field $\\phi$ has a coupling with the Ricci scalar $R$ of\nthe form $G_4(\\phi) R$, including $f(R)$ gravity, can be tightly constrained\nnot only from the cosmic expansion and growth histories but also from the\nvariation of screened gravitational couplings. The cross correlation of\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe signal with galaxy distributions can be a key observable\nfor placing bounds on the relative ratio of cubic Galileon density to total\ndark energy density.

Recently,\nit has been shown that the quantum Rabi model, describing the dipolar coupling\nbetween a two-level atom and a quantized electromagnetic field, violates this\nprinciple. This widely used model describes a plethora of quantum systems and\nphysical processes under different interaction regimes. In the ultrastrong\ncoupling regime, it provides predictions which drastically depend on the chosen\ngauge. This failure is attributed to the finite-level truncation of the matter\nsystem. We show that a careful application of the gauge principle is able to\nrestore gauge invariance even for extreme light-matter interaction regimes. The\nresulting quantum Rabi Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge differs significantly\nfrom the standard model and provides the same physical results obtained by\nusing the dipole gauge. It contains field operators to all orders that cannot\nbe neglected when the coupling strength is high.

Close to this critical point, the ideal gas assumption does not\nhold and large non-ideal fluid behaviours occur. As a representative non-ideal\nfluid, we consider supercritical carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) at pressure of 80 bar,\nwhich is above its critical pressure of 73.9 bar. The Poiseuille flow is\ncharacterized by the Reynolds number\n($Re=\\rho_{w}^{*}u_{r}^{*}h^{*}/\\mu_{w}^{*}$), the product of Prandtl\n($Pr=\\mu_{w}^{*}C_{pw}^{*}/\\kappa_{w}^{*}$) and Eckert number\n($Ec=u_{r}^{*2}/C_{pw}^{*}T_{w}^{*}$), and the wall temperature that in\naddition to pressure determines the thermodynamic reference condition. For low\nEckert numbers, the flow is essentially isothermal and no difference with the\nwell-known stability behaviour of incompressible flows is observed. However, if\nthe Eckert number increases, the viscous heating causes gradients of\nthermodynamic and transport properties, and non-ideal gas effects become\nsignificant. Three regimes of the laminar base flow can be considered,\nsubcritical (temperature in the channel is entirely below its pseudo-critical\nvalue), transcritical, and supercritical temperature regime. If compared to the\nlinear stability of an ideal gas Poiseuille flow, we show that the base flow is\nmore unstable in the subcritical regime, inviscid unstable in the transcritical\nregime, while significantly more stable in the supercritical regime.

This paradigm\nshift calls for smart policies to efficiently share network resources and\nensure service delivery. In this paper, we consider a cognitive dynamic network\narchitecture (CDNA) where primary users (PUs) are rewarded for sharing their\nconnectivities and acting as access points for secondary users (SUs). CDNA\ncreates opportunities for capacity increase by network-wide harvesting of\nunused data plans and spectrum from different operators. Different policies for\ndata and spectrum trading are presented based on centralized, hybrid and\ndistributed schemes involving primary operator (PO), secondary operator (SO)\nand their respective end users. In these schemes, PO and SO progressively\ndelegate trading to their end users and adopt more flexible cooperation\nagreements to reduce computational time and track available resources\ndynamically. A novel matching-with-pricing algorithm is presented to enable\nself-organized SU-PU associations, channel allocation and pricing for data and\nspectrum with low computational complexity. Since connectivity is provided by\nthe actual users, the success of the underlying collaborative market relies on\nthe trustworthiness of the connections. A behavioral-based access control\nmechanism is developed to incentivize/penalize honest/dishonest behavior and\ncreate a trusted collaborative network. Numerical results show that the\ncomputational time of the hybrid scheme is one order of magnitude faster than\nthe benchmark centralized scheme and that the matching algorithm reconfigures\nthe network up to three orders of magnitude faster than in the centralized\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 08:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

The correctness of these operations is\ntherefore essential for the proper execution of any program. However, as soon\nas fault attacks are considered, assuming that the hardware performs its memory\noperations as instructed is not valid anymore. In particular, attackers may\ninduce faults with the goal of reading or writing incorrectly addressed memory,\nwhich can have various critical safety and security implications.\n  In this work, we present a solution to this problem and propose a new method\nfor protecting every memory access inside a program against address tampering.\nThe countermeasure comprises two building blocks. First, every pointer inside\nthe program is redundantly encoded using a multi-residue error detection code.\nThe redundancy information is stored in the unused upper bits of the pointer\nwith zero overhead in terms of storage. Second, load and store instructions are\nextended to link data with the corresponding encoded address from the pointer.\nWrong memory accesses subsequently infect the data value allowing the software\nto detect the error.\n  For evaluation purposes, we implemented our countermeasure into a RISC-V\nprocessor, tested it on a FPGA development board, and evaluated the induced\noverhead. Furthermore, a LLVM-based C compiler has been modified to\nautomatically encode all data pointers, to perform encoded pointer arithmetic,\nand to emit the extended load/store instructions with linking support. Our\nevaluations show that the countermeasure induces an average overhead of 10% in\nterms of code size and 7% regarding runtime, which makes it suitable for\npractical adoption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 09:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

Manufacturing\ntechnology has enabled stacking several gigabytes of DRAM modules on the active\ndie, thereby providing orders of magnitude higher bandwidth as compared to the\nconventional DIMM-based DDR memories. Nevertheless, die-stacked DRAM, due to\nits limited capacity, cannot accommodate entire datasets of modern big-data\napplications. Therefore, prior proposals use it either as a sizable memory-side\ncache or as a part of the software-visible main memory. Cache designs can adapt\nthemselves to the dynamic variations of applications but suffer from the tag\nstorage/latency/bandwidth overhead. On the other hand, memory designs eliminate\nthe need for tags, and hence, provide efficient access to data, but are unable\nto capture the dynamic behaviors of applications due to their static nature.\n  In this work, we make a case for using the die-stacked DRAM partly as main\nmemory and partly as a cache. We observe that in modern big-data applications\nthere are many hot pages with a large number of accesses. Based on this\nobservation, we propose to use a portion of the die-stacked DRAM as main memory\nto host hot pages, enabling serving a significant number of the accesses from\nthe high-bandwidth DRAM without the overhead of tag-checking, and manage the\nrest of the DRAM as a cache, for capturing the dynamic behavior of\napplications. In this proposal, a software procedure pre-processes the\napplication and determines hot pages, then asks the OS to map them to the\nmemory portion of the die-stacked DRAM. The cache portion of the die-stacked\nDRAM is managed by hardware, caching data allocated in the off-chip memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 10:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

However, an additional background arises from interactions of cosmic\nmuons with the rock. Since the neutral particles produced in such interactions\ncan pass through the veto detector without any interaction, they can possibly\nmimic neutrino events in ICAL. In this paper, the results of a GEANT4 based\nsimulation study to estimate the background signals due to muon induced\ninteractions with the rock for SICAL are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 10:48:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 08:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The result, however, does not\napply in the presence of Cost Per Action (CPA) constraints. Such constraints\nexist, for instance, in digital advertising, as some buyer may try to maximize\nthe total number of clicks while keeping the empirical Cost Per Click (CPC)\nbelow a threshold. More generally the CPA constraint implies that the buyer has\na maximal average cost per unit of value in mind.\n  We discuss how such constraints change some traditional results from auction\ntheory.\n  Following the usual textbook narrative on auction theory, we focus\nspecifically on the symmetric setting, We formalize the notion of CPA\nconstrained auctions and derive a Nash equilibrium for second price auctions.\nWe then extend this result to combinations of first and second price auctions.\nFurther, we expose a revenue equivalence property and show that the seller's\nrevenue-maximizing reserve price is zero.\n  In practice, CPA-constrained buyers may target an empirical CPA on a given\ntime horizon, as the auction is repeated many times. Thus his bidding behavior\ndepends on past realization. We show that the resulting buyer dynamic\noptimization problem can be formalized with stochastic control tools and solved\nnumerically with available solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 11:01:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 14:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

The poor\nsensitivity of the Pyramid WFS (PWFS) to differential piston leads to badly\nseen and therefore uncontrollable differential pistons. In close loop\noperation, differential pistons between segments will settle around integer\nvalues of the average sensing wavelength. The differential pistons typically\nrange from one to ten times the sensing wavelength and vary rapidly over time,\nleading to extremely poor performance. In addition, aberrations created by\natmospheric turbulence will contain large amounts of differential piston\nbetween the segments. Removing piston contribution over each of the DM segments\nleads to poor performance. In an attempt to reduce the impact of unwanted\ndifferential pistons that are injected by the AO correction, we compare three\ndifferent approaches. We first limit ourselves to only use the information\nmeasured by the PWFS, in particular by reducing the modulation. We show that\nusing this information sensibly is important but will not be sufficient. We\ndiscuss possible ways of improvement by using prior information. A second\napproach is based on phase closure of the DM commands and assumes the\ncontinuity of the correction wavefront over the entire unsegmented pupil. The\nlast approach is based on the pair-wise slaving of edge actuators and shows the\nbest results. We compare the performance of these methods using realistic\nend-to-end simulations. We find that pair-wise slaving leads to a small\nincrease of the total wavefront error, only adding between 20-45 nm RMS in\nquadrature for seeing conditions between 0.45-0.85 arcsec. Finally, we discuss\nthe possibility of combining the different proposed solutions to increase\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 11:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

Characteristics of a good summary of a video depend on the\nparticular domain under question. We propose a novel framework for domain\nspecific video summarization. Given a video of a particular domain, our system\ncan produce a summary based on what is important for that domain in addition to\npossessing other desired characteristics like representativeness, coverage,\ndiversity etc. as suitable to that domain. Past related work has focused either\non using supervised approaches for ranking the snippets to produce summary or\non using unsupervised approaches of generating the summary as a subset of\nsnippets with the above characteristics. We look at the joint problem of\nlearning domain specific importance of segments as well as the desired summary\ncharacteristic for that domain. Our studies show that the more efficient way of\nincorporating domain specific relevances into a summary is by obtaining ratings\nof shots as opposed to binary inclusion/exclusion information. We also argue\nthat ratings can be seen as unified representation of all possible ground truth\nsummaries of a video, taking us one step closer in dealing with challenges\nassociated with multiple ground truth summaries of a video. We also propose a\nnovel evaluation measure which is more naturally suited in assessing the\nquality of video summary for the task at hand than F1 like measures. It\nleverages the ratings information and is richer in appropriately modeling\ndesirable and undesirable characteristics of a summary.

We obtained high-precision follow-up radial\nvelocity measurements from HARPS, and the joint Bayesian analysis showed that\nK2-265 b has a radius of 1.71 +/- 0.11 R_earth and a mass of 6.54 +/- 0.84\nM_earth, corresponding to a bulk density of 7.1 +/- 1.8 g/cm^3 . Composition\nanalysis of the planet reveals an Earth-like, rocky interior, with a rock mass\nfraction of 80%. The short orbital period and small radius of the planet puts\nit below the lower limit of the photoevaporation gap, where the envelope of the\nplanet could have eroded due to strong stellar irradiation, leaving behind an\nexposed core. Knowledge of the planet core composition allows us to infer the\npossible formation and evolution mechanism responsible for its current physical\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 12:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The basic assumption which underlies the dynamics\nis that the information gathering process is not instantaneous but requires\nmaturation. Agents steadily refine and update their personal opinion via a\nrecurrent consultation of a public pool which stores information tokens (ITs).\nThe expectation for the innovative idea is monitored in real-time by counting\nthe number of stored ITs. The flow dynamics of ITs is assimilated to a single\nnode queuing system (QS) with feedback loop. It incorporates the information\npool (the waiting room), an IT inflow, and a service outflow that stylizes the\ninformation gathering process. Contrary to basic queuing theory, here the ITs\nroaming the QS are endowed with time-dependent internal variables. This\nadditional dynamic information is used to construct the information maturation\nprocess. Such a maturation of the information introduces response delays into\nthe dynamics, which ultimately generates the collective disillusionment trough.\nWe illustrate the introduced generic modeling framework by considering in\ndetails the hype cycle dynamics, a key managerial topic when dealing with\ndiffusion of innovation. In a second part of the paper, we introduce a stylized\nframework to detect, as soon as possible, the onset of the collective\ndisillusionment phase, while minimizing the frequency of false alarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 13:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 19:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Their realization,\nhowever, meets a major stumbling block -- the motion-induced dephasing of the\ntransition between the ground and Rydberg states. By using quantum interference\nbetween different detuned Rabi oscillations, we propose a practical scheme to\nrealize a class of accurate entangling Rydberg quantum gates subject to a\nminimal dephasing error. We show two types of such gates, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$,\nin the form of $\\text{diag}\\{1, e^{i\\alpha}, e^{i\\gamma}, e^{i\\beta}\\}$, where\n$\\alpha, \\gamma$, and $\\beta$ are determined by the parameters of lasers and\nthe Rydberg blockade $V$. $U_{1}$ is realized by sending to the two qubits a\nsingle off-resonant laser pulse, while $U_{2}$ is realized by individually\napplying one pulse of detuned laser to each qubit. Our method has several\nadvantages. First, the gates are accurate because the fidelity of $U_k$ is\nlimited only by a rotation error below $10^{-5}$ and the Rydberg-state decay.\nDecay error on the order of $10^{-5}$ can be easily obtained because all\ntransitions are detuned, resulting in small population in Rydberg state.\nSecond, the motion-induced dephasing is minimized because there is no gap time\nin which a population is left in the Rydberg shelving states of either qubit.\nThird, the gate is resilient to the variation of $V$. This is because among the\nthree phases $\\alpha,\\gamma$, and $\\beta$, only the last has a (partial)\ndependence on $V$. Fourth, the Rabi frequency and $V$ in our scheme are of\nsimilar magnitude, which permits a fast implementation of the gate when both of\nthem are of the feasible magnitude of several megahertz. The rapidity,\naccuracy, and feasibility of this interference method can lay the foundation\nfor entangling gates in universal quantum computing with neutral atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 14:13:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 08:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

It is a reference for all other\nobserved stars and a laboratory of fundamental physics helping us understand\nprocesses occuring in conditions irreproducible on Earth. However, our\nunderstanding of the Sun is currently stained by the solar modelling problem\nwhich can stem from various causes, such as the opacities, the equation of\nstate and the mixing of chemical elements. We combine inversions of sound\nspeed, an entropy proxy and the Ledoux discriminant with constraints such as\nthe position of the base of the convective zone and the photospheric helium\nabundance. We test various combinations of standard ingredients for solar\nmodelling such as abundance tables, equation of state, formalism for convection\nand diffusion and opacity tables and study the diagnostic potential of the\ninversions to constrain ad-hoc modifications of the opacity profile and\nadditional mixing below the convective envelope. Combining inversions provides\nstringent constraints on the modifications on the models, far beyond what is\nachievable only from sound speed inversions. We constrain the form and\namplitude of the opacity increase required and show that a 15% increase at log\nT=6.35 provides a significant improvement but that a more global increase of\nthe opacity, within the uncertainties of current tables, coupled with an\nadditional mixing at the bottom of the convective zone gives the best agreement\nfor low metallicity models. We show that high metallicity models do not satisfy\nall the inversion results. We conclude that the solar problem likely occurs\nfrom various small sources, as ingredients such as the equation of state or the\nformalism of convection can induce small but significant changes and that using\nphase shift analyses combined with our approach is the next step for a better\nunderstanding of the inaccuracies of solar models just below the convective\nenvelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 14:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

It exhibits a tidal tail, very boxy\nisophotes, and multiple nuclei or regions (A, B, and C) that are bluer than the\nbulk population of the galaxy, indicating a younger age. These properties are\nsuggestive of a dwarf-dwarf merger remnant. We use the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic\nExplorer (MUSE) at the VLT to investigate NGC 7796-DW1. We extract\ncharacteristic spectra to which we apply the STARLIGHT population synthesis\nsoftware to obtain ages and metallicities of the various population components\nof the galaxy. The galaxy's main body is old and metal-poor. A surprising\nresult is the extended line emission in the galaxy, forming a ring-like\nstructure with a projected diameter of 2.2 kpc. The line ratios fall into the\nregime of HII-regions, although OB-stellar populations cannot be identified by\nspectral signatures. Nucleus A is a relatively old (7 Gyr or older) and\nmetal-poor super star cluster, most probably the nucleus of the dwarf, now\ndisplaced. The star-forming regions B and C show younger and distinctly more\nmetal-rich components. The emission line ratios of regions B and C indicate an\nalmost solar oxygen abundance, if compared with radiation models of HII\nregions. NGC7796-DW1 occupies a particular role in the group of transition-type\ngalaxies with respect to its origin and current evolutionary state, being the\ncompanion of an IE. The dwarf-dwarf merger scenario is excluded because of the\nmissing metal-rich merger component. A viable alternative is gas accretion from\na reservoir of cold, metal-rich gas. NGC7796 has to provide this gas within its\nX-ray bright halo. As illustrated by NGC7796-DW1, cold accretion may be a\ngeneral solution to the problem of extended star formation histories in\ntransition dwarf galaxies.

Moreover, negative conductivity has been\nclaimed to occur for light bosons in moderate electric fields, and for fermions\nof any mass in electric fields below a certain threshold. Furthemore, in the\nlimit of large mass and weak electric field, the current contains terms which\nare not exponentially suppressed, contrary to the semiclassical intuition. Here\nwe explain these behaviors, showing that most of the reported negative\nconductivity is spurious. First, we show that the terms which are not\nexponentially suppressed follow precisely from the local Euler-Heisenberg\nLagrangian (suitably generalized to curved space). Thus, such terms are\nunrelated to pair creation or to the transport of electric charge. Rather, they\ncorrespond to non-linearities of the electric field (responsible in particular\nfor vacuum birefringence). The remaining contributions are exponentially\nsuppressed and correspond to the creation of Schwinger pairs. Second, we argue\nthat for light carriers the negative term in the regularized current does not\ncorrespond to a negative conductivity, but to the logarithmic running of the\nelectric coupling constant, up to the high energy Hubble scale. We conclude\nthat none of the above mentioned negative contributions can cause an\ninstability such as the spontaneous growth of an electric field in de Sitter,\nat least within the weak coupling regime. Third, we provide a heuristic\nderivation of infrared hyperconductivity, which clarifies its possible role in\nmagnetogenesis scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 14:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 16:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Recently it was observed [Phys. Rev.

Conversely,\nthe conditional energy before the measurement process is shown to be given by\nthe real component of the weak value of the Hamiltonian. Our definition\ngeneralises well-known notions of distributions of internal energy change, such\nas that given by stochastic thermodynamics. By determining the conditional\nenergy change of both system and measurement apparatus, we obtain the full\nconditional work statistics of quantum measurements, and show that this\nvanishes for all measurement outcomes if the measurement process conserves the\ntotal energy.

Methods: The Monte Carlo code PENELOPE was used to simulate the\nirradiation of a human head phantom with a variety of micro- and mini-beam\narrays, with beams narrower than 100mum and above 500mum, respectively, and\nwith radiation fields of 1cmx2cm and 2cmx2cm. The dose in the phantom due to\nthese beams was calculated by superposing the dose profiles obtained for a\nsingle beam of 1mumx2cm. A parameter delta, accounting for the total\ndisplacement of the brain during the irradiation and due to the\ncardio-synchronous pulsation, was used to quantify the impact on peak-to-valley\ndose ratios and the full-width at half-maximum. Results: The difference between\nthe maximum (at the phantom entrance) and the minimum (at the phantom exit)\nvalues of the peak-to-valley dose ratio reduces when the parameter $\\delta$\nincreases.

Yet these tests remain confined to the scale of stellar\nsystems or the strong gravity regime. A departure from GR on larger,\ncosmological scales has been advocated by the proponents of modified gravity\ntheories as an alternative to the Cosmological Constant to account for the\nobserved cosmic expansion history. While indistinguishable in these terms by\nconstruction, such models on the other hand yield distinct values for the\nlinear growth rate of density perturbations and, as a consequence, for the\nassociated galaxy peculiar velocity field. Measurements of the resulting\nanisotropy of galaxy clustering, when spectroscopic redshifts are used to\nderive distances, have thus been proposed as a powerful probe of the validity\nof GR on cosmological scales. However, despite significant effort in modelling\nsuch redshift space distortions, systematic errors remain comparable to current\nstatistical uncertainties. Here, we present the results of a different\nforward-modelling approach, which fully exploits the sensitivity of the galaxy\nvelocity field to modifications of GR. We use state-of-the-art, high-resolution\nN-body simulations of a standard GR and a compelling f(R) model, one of GR's\nsimplest variants, to build simulated catalogues of stellar-mass-selected\ngalaxies through a robust match to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey observations.\nWe find that, well within the uncertainty of this technique, f(R) fails to\nreproduce the observed redshift-space clustering on scales 1-10 Mpc/h. Instead,\nthe standard LCDM GR model agrees impressively well with the data. This result\nprovides a strong confirmation, on cosmological scales, of the robustness of\nEinstein's general theory of relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 15:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 05:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

Motivated by such experimental findings, we simulate\nthe sub-second grid frequency dynamics by perturbing the power grid, as modeled\nby a network of phase coupled nonlinear oscillators, with synthetically\ngenerated wind power feed-in time series. We derive a linear response theory\nand obtain analytical results for the variance of frequency increment\ndistributions. We find that the variance of short-term fluctuations decays, for\nlarge inertia, exponentially with distance to the feed-in node, in agreement\nwith numerical results both for a linear chain of nodes and the German\ntransmission grid topology. In sharp contrast, the kurtosis of frequency\nincrements is numerically found to decay only slowly, not exponentially, in\nboth systems, indicating that the non-Gaussian shape of frequency fluctuations\npersists over long ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 11:32:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 15:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 08:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

The\ncomplexity of bubble dynamics and the limited understanding of their behavior\nrestricts the exploration of their full potential. The bubble oscillator is a\nhighly nonlinear system, which makes it difficult to generate a comprehensive\nunderstanding of its oscillatory behavior. One method used to investigate such\ncomplex dynamical systems is the bifurcation analysis. Numerous investigations\nhave employed the method of bifurcation diagrams to study the effect of\ndifferent control parameters on the bubble behavior. These studies, however,\nfocused mainly on investigating the subharmonic (SH) and chaotic oscillations\nof the bubbles. Super-harmonic (SuH) and ultra-harmonic (UH) bubble\noscillations remain under-investigated. One reason is that the conventional\nmethod used for generating bifurcation diagrams cannot reliably identify\nfeatures that are responsible for the identification of SuH and UH\noscillations. Additionally, the conventional method cannot distinguish between\nthe UHs and SHs. We introduce a simple procedure for the generation of\nbifurcation diagrams to address this shortcoming. This method selects the\nmaxima of the bubble oscillatory response and plots them alongside the\ntraditional bifurcation points for the corresponding control parameter. Through\napplying this method, the oscillatory behavior of the bubble oscillator is\nanalyzed, and stable SuH and UH bubble oscillations are investigated. Based on\nthis new analysis, the conditions for the generation and amplification of UH\nand SuH regimes are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 14:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}
