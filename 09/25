Towards\ndeveloping more reliable and efficient computational tools for GN monitoring,\ncontrol, and planning, this work considers the task of solving the nonlinear\nequations governing steady-state flows and pressures in GNs. It is first shown\nthat if the gas flow equations are feasible, they enjoy a unique solution. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first result proving uniqueness of the\nsteady-state gas flow solution over the entire feasible domain of gas\ninjections. To find this solution, we put forth a mixed-integer second-order\ncone program (MI-SOCP)-based solver relying on a relaxation of the gas flow\nequations. This relaxation is provably exact under specific network topologies.\nUnlike existing alternatives, the devised solver does not need proper\ninitialization or knowing the gas flow directions beforehand, and can handle\ngas networks with compressors. Numerical tests on tree and meshed networks with\nrandom gas injections indicate that the relaxation is exact even when the\nderived conditions are not met.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 16:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

One strategy consists of reducing\nthe thermal conductivity while increasing or retaining the thermoelectric power\nfactor. An approach to achieve this is doping to enhance the Seebeck\ncoefficient and electrical conductivity, while simultaneously introducing\ndefects in the materials to increase phonon scattering. Here, we use Mg ion\nimplantation to induce defects in epitaxial ScN (111) films. The films were\nimplanted with Mg+ ions with different concentration profiles along the\nthickness of the film, incorporating 0.35 to 2.2 at.% of Mg in ScN.\nImplantation at high temperature (600 C), with few defects due to the\ntemperature, does not substantially affect the thermal conductivity compared to\na reference ScN. Samples implanted at room temperature, in contrast, exhibited\na reduction of the thermal conductivity by a factor of three. The sample doped\nwith 2.2 at.% Mg also showed an increased power factor after implantation. This\nstudy thus shows the effect of ion-induced defects on thermal conductivity of\nScN films. High-temperature implantation allows the defects to be annealed out\nduring implantation, while the defects are retained for room-temperature\nimplanted samples, allowing for a drastic reduction in thermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 16:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Typically, instead of\nvalidating block data, they assume that the chain favoured by the blockchain's\nconsensus algorithm only contains valid blocks, and that the majority of block\nproducers are honest. By allowing such clients to receive fraud proofs\ngenerated by fully validating nodes that show that a block violates the\nprotocol rules, and combining this with probabilistic sampling techniques to\nverify that all of the data in a block actually is available to be downloaded,\nwe can eliminate the honest-majority assumption, and instead make much weaker\nassumptions about a minimum number of honest nodes that rebroadcast data.

Methods: The air\ndensity dependence of three different SourceCheck 4pi chambers was studied by\nmeasuring 125I sources. Measurements were taken by varying the pressure from\n746.6 to 986.6hPa in a pressure chamber. Three different HDR 1000 Plus\nionization chambers were also analyzed under similar conditions. A linear and a\npotential-like function of the air density were fitted to experimental data and\ntheir achievement in describing them was analyzed. Results: SourceCheck 4pi\nchamber response showed a residual dependence on the air density once the\nstandard pressure and temperature factor was applied. The chamber response was\noverestimated when the air density was below that under normal atmospheric\nconditions. A similar dependence was found for the HDR 1000 Plus chambers\nanalyzed. A linear function of the air density permitted a very good\ndescription of this residual dependence, better than with a potential function.\nNo significant variability between the different specimens of the same chamber\nmodel studied was found. Conclusion: The effect of overestimation observed in\nthe chamber responses once they are corrected for the standard pressure and\ntemperature may represent a non-negligible ~4% overestimation in high altitude\ncities as ours (700 m AMSL). This overestimation behaves linearly with the air\ndensity in all cases analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 16:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

SN 2005ip is of particular interest since dust has\nbeen inferred to have formed in both the ejecta and the post-shock region\nbehind the radiative reverse shock. We have collated eight optical archival\nspectra that span the lifetime of SN 2005ip and we additionally present a new\nX-shooter optical-near-IR spectrum of SN 2005ip at 4075d post-discovery. Using\nthe Monte Carlo line transfer code DAMOCLES, we have modelled the blueshifted\nbroad and intermediate width H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ and He I lines from 48d to\n4075d post-discovery using an ejecta dust model. We find that dust in the\nejecta can account for the asymmetries observed in the broad and intermediate\nwidth H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ and He I line profiles at all epochs and that it is\nnot necessary to invoke post-shock dust formation to explain the blueshifting\nobserved in the intermediate width post-shock lines. Using a Bayesian approach,\nwe have determined the evolution of the ejecta dust mass in SN 2005ip over 10\nyears presuming an ejecta dust model, with an increasing dust mass from\n~10$^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ at 48d to a current dust mass of $\\sim$0.1 M$_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 17:01:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

Within the Cmcm phase, site-specific spin crossover is initiated and\ninvolves only highly distorted octahedral sites constituting ~25% of all Fe\nlocations. This is manifest as a steeper volume decrease of dV/V0 ~ 3.5% beyond\n~40 GPa and an emergent diamagnetic component discerned in 57Fe M\\\"ossbauer\nspectroscopy at variable cryogenic temperatures. A subsequent Cmcm to Pmma\nFe/Ti disorder-order reconfiguration is facilitated at 6-fold coordinated\n(octahedral) sites. The rest of the high-spin Fe in 6-fold and 8-fold\ncoordinated sites (~75% abundance) in the Pmma phase exhibit average saturation\ninternal magnetic fields of H$_{hf}$ ~ 42 T to ~90 GPa, typical of spin-only\n(orbitally quenched) Fermi-contact values. By contrast average H$_{hf}$ ~ 20 T\nvalues, signifying unquenched orbital moments, occur below the 40-45 GPa\nspin-crossover initiation regime in the Cmcm phase.

As a first step\ntowards a full free-form lens modelling technique, we consider linear inversion\nof the lensed source under sparse regularisation and joint deblending from the\nlens light profile. The method is based on morphological component analysis,\nassuming a known mass model. We show with numerical experiments that\nrepresenting the lens and source light using an undecimated wavelet basis\nallows us to reconstruct the source and to separate it from the foreground lens\nat the same time.

The new dedicated\nD-shaped collimator is easier to build and produces dose distributions that\nonly differ on the field size with respect to the dose distributions obtained\nby the current collimator in use.\n  Methods: The Monte Carlo code PENELOPE was used to study the effect that the\nstructural elements of the collimator have on the absorbed dose distribution.\nThe radiation transport through a Varian Clinac 2100 C/D operating at 6MV was\nsimulated in order to tally phase-space files which were used as radiation\nsources to simulate the considered collimators and the subsequent dose\ndistributions.\n  Results: The proposed collimator delivers a dose distribution which is 2.4cm\nwide along the inferior-superior direction of the eyeball.

The other relevant characteristics of the dose distribution\nobtained with the new collimator, namely, depth doses, penumbrae width and\nshape of the lateral profiles, are statistically compatible with the results\nobtained for the collimator in use.\n  Conclusions: The smaller field size delivered by the proposed collimator\nstill fully covers the planning target volume with at least 95% of the maximum\ndose at a depth of 2cm and provides a safety margin of 0.2cm, so ensuring an\nadequate treatment while reducing the dose absorbed by surrounding structures\nof the eye.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 18:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Motivated by this gap, we\ndevelop a stochastic mirror descent method where we choose the distance\ngenerating function to be defined as the quantum entropy. This method is a\nsingle-loop first-order method in the sense that it only requires a\ngradient-type of update at each iteration. The novelty of this work lies in the\nconvergence analysis that is carried out through employing an auxiliary\nsequence of stochastic matrices. Our contribution is three-fold: (i) under this\nsetting and employing averaging techniques, we show that the iterate generated\nby the algorithm converges to a weak solution of the SVI; (ii) moreover, we\nderive a convergence rate in terms of the expected value of a suitably defined\ngap function; (iii) we implement the developed method for solving a\nmultiple-input multiple-output multi-cell cellular wireless network composed of\nseven hexagonal cells and present the numerical experiments supporting the\nconvergence of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 18:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

When the sample size for a given area is small,\nstandard confidence intervals based on data only from that area can be\nunacceptably wide. In order to reduce interval width, practitioners often\nutilize multilevel models in order to borrow information across areas,\nresulting in intervals centered around shrinkage estimators. However, such\nintervals only have the nominal coverage rate on average across areas under the\nassumed model for across-area heterogeneity. The coverage rate for a given area\ndepends on the actual value of the area mean, and can be nearly zero for areas\nwith means that are far from the across-group average. As such, the use of\nuncertainty intervals centered around shrinkage estimators are inappropriate\nwhen area-specific coverage rates are desired. In this article, we propose an\nalternative confidence interval procedure for area means and totals under\nnormally distributed sampling errors. This procedure not only has constant\n$1-\\alpha$ frequentist coverage for all values of the target quantity, but also\nuses auxiliary information to borrow information across areas. Because of this,\nthe corresponding intervals have shorter expected lengths than standard\nconfidence intervals centered on the unbiased direct estimator. Importantly,\nthe coverage of the procedure does not depend on the assumed model for\nacross-area heterogeneity. Rather, improvements to the model for across-area\nheterogeneity result in reduced expected interval width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 18:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

The purpose of this work is to evaluate\nthe adequacy of Monte Carlo simulations and the accuracy of a commercial\ntreatment planning system by means of experimental measurements. Dose\nmeasurements in water were performed using a dedicated collimator.\n  Methods: A 6MV Varian Clinac 2100 C/D and a dedicated collimator are used for\nRB treatment. The collimator conforms a D-shaped off-axis field whose\nirradiated area can be either 5.2 or 3.1cm$^2$. Depth dose distributions and\nlateral profiles were measured and compared with Monte Carlo simulations run\nwith PENELOPE and with calculations performed with the analytical anisotropic\nalgorithm (AAA) using the gamma test.\n  Results: PENELOPE simulations agree well with the experimental data with\ndiscrepancies in the dose profiles less than 3mm of distance-to-agreement and\n3% of dose. Discrepancies between the results of AAA and the experimental data\nreach 3mm and 6%. The agreement in the penumbra region between AAA and the\nexperiment is noticeably worse than that between the latter and PENELOPE. The\npercentage of voxels passing the gamma test when comparing PENELOPE (AAA) and\nthe experiment is on average 99% (93%) assuming a 3mm distance-to-agreement and\na discrepancy of 3% of dose.\n  Conclusions: Although the discrepancies between AAA and experimental results\nare noticeable, it is possible to consider this algorithm for routine treatment\nplanning of RB patients, provided the limitations of the algorithm are known\nand taken into account by the medical physicist. Monte Carlo simulation is\nessential for knowing these limitations. Monte Carlo simulation is required for\noptimizing the treatment technique and the dedicated collimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 18:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

One is the breaking of symmetry of the\ncoevolutionary pattern, where the phenotypes evolve towards one of two\nevolutionarily stable patterns. As population size increases, the phenotypes\noscillate between these two values in a novel form of Red Queen dynamics, the\nepisodic reversal between the two stable patterns.

The relative importance of\nthe various desorption mechanisms is of uttermost importance for astrophysical\nmodels to constrain the chemical evolution in such high density dense cloud\nregions. In this experimental work we investigated the sputtering yield as a\nfunction of ice mantle thickness, exposed to Xe ions at 95MeV. The ion induced\nice phase transformation and the sputtering yield were simultaneously monitored\nby IR spectroscopy and mass spec- trometry, respectively. The sputtering yield\nis constant above a characteristic ice layer thickness and starts to decrease\nbelow this thickness. An estimate of the sputtering depth corresponding to this\nlength can be evaluated. In these experiments the measured desorption depth\ncorresponds to 30 ice layers. Assuming an effective cylindrical shape for the\nvolume of sputtered molecules, the aspect ratio is close to unity; in the\nsemi-infinite ice film case this ratio is the diameter to height of the\ncylinder.

The measured infinite thickness sputtering yield for water ice\nmantles scales as the square of the ion electronic stopping power (Se).

In this work, we aim to take advantage of additional cues obtained\nfrom different body regions in a zooming in fashion for person recognition.\nHence, we present Zoom-RNN, a novel method based on recurrent neural networks\nfor combining evidence extracted from the whole body, upper body, and head\nregions. Our model is evaluated on a challenging dataset, namely People In\nPhoto Albums (PIPA), and we demonstrate that employing our system improves the\nperformance of conventional fusion methods by a noticeable margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 19:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 01:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

As manual inspec-tions can be time consuming,\nlaborious and dangerous, research has been underway to develop methods to help\nspeed up and increase the automation of the entire process. Researchers\ntypi-cally envisage the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for data\nacquisition and computer vision for data processing to extract actionable\ninformation. In this work we propose a new framework to generate vision-based\ncondition-aware models that can serve as the basis for speeding up or\nautomating higher level inspection decisions.

With these results, the explicit construction of DD structures for\nall Lorentzian kinematical groups in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions is completed,\nand the connection between (anti-)de Sitter and Poincar\\'e $r$-matrices through\nthe vanishing cosmological constant limit is also analysed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 20:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

The incompatible axial\ngrowth of the straight capillary is found to control the onset of a bifurcation\ntowards a tortuous shape. The post-buckling morphology is studied using a mixed\nfinite element formulation in the fully nonlinear regime.

This measure quantifies the maximal gain of an adversary in\ninferring any (potentially random) function of a dataset from a release of the\ndata. The inferential capability of the adversary is, in turn, quantified by a\nclass of adversarial loss functions that we introduce as $\\alpha$-loss,\n$\\alpha\\in[1,\\infty]$. The choice of $\\alpha$ determines the specific\nadversarial action and ranges from refining a belief (about any function of the\ndata) for $\\alpha=1$ to guessing the most likely value for $\\alpha=\\infty$\nwhile refining the $\\alpha^{th}$ moment of the belief for $\\alpha$ in between.\nMaximal alpha-leakage then quantifies the adversarial gain under $\\alpha$-loss\nover all possible functions of the data. In particular, for the extremal values\nof $\\alpha=1$ and $\\alpha=\\infty$, maximal alpha-leakage simplifies to mutual\ninformation and maximal leakage, respectively. For $\\alpha\\in(1,\\infty)$ this\nmeasure is shown to be the Arimoto channel capacity of order $\\alpha$. We show\nthat maximal alpha-leakage satisfies data processing inequalities and a\nsub-additivity property thereby allowing for a weak composition result.\nBuilding upon these properties, we use maximal alpha-leakage as the privacy\nmeasure and study the problem of data publishing with privacy guarantees,\nwherein the utility of the released data is ensured via a hard distortion\nconstraint. Unlike average distortion, hard distortion provides a deterministic\nguarantee of fidelity.

Such data are commonly found in spatial applications,\nsuch as climatology and criminology, where measurements are restricted to a\ngeographical area. Other settings include domains where unsuitable recordings\nare discarded, such as flow-cytometry measurements. A simple approach to\nmodeling such data is through the use of mixture models, especially\nnonparametric mixture models. Mixture models, while flexible and theoretically\nwell-understood, are unsuitable for settings involving complicated constraints,\nleading to difficulties in specifying the component distributions and in\nevaluating normalization constants. Bayesian inference over the parameters of\nthese models results in posterior distributions that are doubly-intractable. We\naddress this problem via an algorithm based on rejection sampling and data\naugmentation. We view samples from a truncated distribution as outcomes of a\nrejection sampling scheme, where proposals are made from a simple mixture model\nand are rejected if they violate the constraints. Our scheme proceeds by\nimputing the rejected samples given mixture parameters and then resampling\nparameters given all samples.

Here we present a case study in which we frame the\nissue of bias detection as a causal inference problem with observational data.\nWe enumerate two main causes of bias, sampling bias and label bias, and we\ninvestigate the abilities of six different fairness metrics to detect each bias\ntype. Based on these investigations, we propose a set of best practice\nguidelines to select the fairness metric that is most likely to detect bias if\nit is present. Additionally, we aim to identify the conditions in which certain\nfairness metrics may fail to detect bias and instead give practitioners a false\nbelief that their biased model is making fair decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 22:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

The ability to achieve $p_s > 0.5$ has been found to be\ncritical in resource-efficient realizations of linear optical quantum computing\nand all-photonic quantum repeaters. Yet, the aforesaid value of $p_s > 0.5$ is\nnot known to be the maximum achievable using squeezing, thereby leaving it open\nwhether close-to-$100\\%$ efficient BSM might be achievable using squeezing as a\nresource. In this paper, we report new insights on why squeezing-enhanced BSM\nachieves $p_s > 0.5$. Using this, we show that the previously-reported ${p_s\n\\approx 0.643}$ at single-mode squeezing strength $r=0.6585$---for unambiguous\nstate discrimination (USD) of all four Bell states---is an experimentally\nunachievable point result, which drops to $p_s \\approx 0.59$ with the slightest\nchange in $r$. We however show that squeezing-induced boosting of $p_s$ with\nUSD operation is still possible over a continuous range of $r$, with an\nexperimentally achievable maximum occurring at $r=0.5774$, achieving ${p_s\n\\approx 0.596}$. Finally, deviating from USD operation, we explore a\ntrade-space between $p_s$, the probability with which the BSM circuit declares\na \"success\", versus the probability of error $p_e$, the probability of an input\nBell state being erroneously identified given the circuit declares a success.\nSince quantum error correction could correct for some $p_e > 0$, this tradeoff\nmay enable better quantum repeater designs by potentially increasing the\nentanglement generation rates with $p_s$ exceeding what is possible with\ntraditionally-studied USD operation of BSMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 00:12:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 20:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

Historically, studies of the Hall effect have led\nto major breakthroughs including the discoveries of Berry curvature and the\ntopological Chern invariants. In magnets, the internal magnetization allows\nHall conductivity in the absence of external magnetic field. This anomalous\nHall effect (AHE) has become an important tool to study quantum magnets. In\nnonmagnetic materials without external magnetic fields, the electrical Hall\neffect is rarely explored because of the constraint by time-reversal symmetry.\nHowever, strictly speaking, only the Hall effect in the linear response regime,\ni.e., the Hall voltage linearly proportional to the external electric field,\nidentically vanishes due to time-reversal symmetry. The Hall effect in the\nnonlinear response regime, on the other hand, may not be subject to such\nsymmetry constraints. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear Hall\neffect (NLHE) in the electrical transport of the nonmagnetic 2D quantum\nmaterial, bilayer WTe2. Specifically, flowing an electrical current in bilayer\nWTe2 leads to a nonlinear Hall voltage in the absence of magnetic field. The\nNLHE exhibits unusual properties sharply distinct from the AHE in metals: The\nNLHE shows a quadratic I-V characteristic; It strongly dominates the nonlinear\nlongitudinal response, leading to a Hall angle of about 90 degree. We further\nshow that the NLHE directly measures the \"dipole moment\" of the Berry\ncurvature, which arises from layer-polarized Dirac fermions in bilayer WTe2.\nOur results demonstrate a new Hall effect and provide a powerful methodology to\ndetect Berry curvature in a wide range of nonmagnetic quantum materials in an\nenergy-resolved way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 01:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

To overcome this drawback, we propose a framework called\nTripleNet where triple supervisions including detection-oriented supervision,\nclass-aware segmentation supervision, and class-agnostic segmentation\nsupervision are imposed on each layer of the decoder network. Class-agnostic\nsegmentation supervision provides an objectness prior knowledge for both\nsemantic segmentation and object detection. Besides the three types of\nsupervisions, two light-weight modules (i.e., inner-connected module and\nattention skip-layer fusion) are also incorporated into each layer of the\ndecoder. In the proposed framework, detection and segmentation can sufficiently\nboost each other. Moreover, class-agnostic and class-aware segmentation on each\ndecoder layer are not performed at the test stage. Therefore, no extra\ncomputational costs are introduced at the test stage. Experimental results on\nthe VOC2007 and VOC2012 datasets demonstrate that the proposed TripleNet is\nable to improve both the detection and segmentation accuracies without adding\nextra computational costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 03:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

Typically, such a regularizer aims to manipulate a statistical\ncharacteristic over all classes together. For classification tasks, however, it\nmight be advantageous to enforce the desired characteristic per class such that\ndifferent classes can be better distinguished. Motivated by the idea, we design\ntwo class-wise regularizers that explicitly utilize class information:\nclass-wise Covariance Regularizer (cw-CR) and class-wise Variance Regularizer\n(cw-VR). cw-CR targets to reduce the covariance of representations calculated\nfrom the same class samples for encouraging feature independence. cw-VR is\nsimilar, but variance instead of covariance is targeted to improve feature\ncompactness.

Two types of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are used\nfor such tasks: model-free or model-based. Each of these approaches has\nlimitations. Model-free RL struggles to transfer learned information when the\ngoal location changes, but achieves high asymptotic accuracy in single goal\ntasks. Model-based RL can transfer learned information to new goal locations by\nretaining the explicitly learned state-dynamics, but is limited by the fact\nthat small errors in modelling these dynamics accumulate over long-term\nplanning. In this work, we improve upon the limitations of model-free RL in\nmulti-goal domains. We do this by adapting the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for RL\nand call the adaptation Floyd-Warshall RL (FWRL). The proposed algorithm learns\na goal-conditioned action-value function by constraining the value of the\noptimal path between any two states to be greater than or equal to the value of\npaths via intermediary states.

Our analysis gives a simple\nexplanation as to why poor minima of the loss cannot be encountered in the\noverparametrized regime, and puts forward the surprising result that the\nability of fully connected networks to fit random data is independent of their\ndepth.

If the flare represents a short period of\naccretion onto an IMBH during the periastron passage of a donor star on an\neccentric (i.e., repeating) or parabolic (non-repeating) orbit, we argue that\nthe flare's rise time corresponds to the duration during which the donor's\ntidally stripped mass joins a residual disk at the pericenter. This duration is\nin turn equal to three other time scales: the duration of stripping, the sound\ncrossing time of the donor, and the circular orbit time at the pericenter\nradius. Only a white dwarf can have a sound crossing time as short as one\nminute. Therefore, the donor must be a white dwarf and it was stripped of\n~10^{-10} M_sun upon each passage at several to tens of Schwarzschild radii\nfrom the IMBH.

Due to its open-loop architecture, RBC\nfaces the challenge of providing dynamic current and voltage to optimize\nbattery charging performance. In RBC, battery overcharge may cause energy\nwaste, thermal effects, and even safety issues. On the other hand, battery\nundercharge may lead to charging time extension and significant battery\ncapacity reduction. In this paper, we present an adaptive resonant beam\ncharging (ARBC) system for battery charging optimization. Based on RBC, ARBC\nuses a feedback system to control the supplied power dynamically according to\nthe battery preferred charging values. Moreover, in order to transform the\nreceived current and voltage to match the battery preferred charging values,\nARBC adopts a direct current to direct current (DC-DC) conversion circuit.\nRelying on the analytical models for RBC power transmission, we obtain the\nend-to-end power transfer relationship in the approximate linear closed-form of\nARBC. Thus, the battery preferred charging power at the receiver can be mapped\nto the supplied power at the transmitter for feedback control. Numerical\nevaluation demonstrates that ARBC can save 61% battery charging energy and\n53%-60% supplied energy compared with RBC. Furthermore, ARBC has high\nenergy-saving gain over RBC when the WPT is unefficient. ARBC in WPT is similar\nto link adaption in wireless communications.

The current NVM deployment is symmetric, where NVM devices are\ndirectly attached to servers. Due to the higher density, NVM provides larger\ncapacity and can be shared among servers. Unfortunately, in the symmetric\nsetting, the availability of NVM devices is affected by the specific machine it\nis attached to. High availability can be realized by replicating data to NVM on\na remote machine. However, it requires full replication of data structure in\nlocal memory, limiting the size of the working set. This paper rethinks NVM\ndeployment and makes a case for the asymmetric NVM architecture, which\ndecouples servers from persistent data storage. In the proposed AsymNVM\narchitecture, NVM devices (back-end nodes) can be shared by multiple servers\n(front-end nodes) and provide recoverable persistent data structures. The\nasymmetric architecture is made possible by RDMA, and follows the recent\nindustry trend of resource disaggregation. We build AsymNVM framework based on\nAsymNVM architecture that implements: 1) high performance persistent data\nstructure update; 2) NVM data management; 3) concurrency control; and 4)\ncrash-consistency and replication. The central idea is to use operation logs to\nreduce the stall due to RDMA writes and enable efficient batching and caching\nin front-end nodes. To evaluation performance, we construct eight widely used\ndata structures and two applications based on AsymNVM framework, and use traces\nof industry workloads. In a cluster with ten machines, the results show that\nAsymNVM achieves comparable performance to the best possible symmetric\narchitecture while avoiding all the drawbacks with disaggregation.

Relying on\nexperiments on a breast DCE-MRI dataset that contains scans of 117 patients,\nour results show that the post-hoc method is more accurate for diagnosing the\nwhole volume per patient, achieving an AUC of 0.91, while the pre-hoc method\nachieves an AUC of 0.81. However, the performance for localising the malignant\nlesions remains challenging for the post-hoc method due to the weakly labelled\ndataset employed during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 10:48:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 04:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Triangular lateration (TL) is fast and scalable but employs a\nmonotone RSS-to-distance transformation that unfortunately assumes mobile\ndevices are on the line of sight. Radio frequency fingerprinting (RFP) methods\nemploy a reference database, which ensures accurate localization but\nunfortunately hinders scalability.\n  Here, we propose a new, simple, and robust method called lookup lateration\n(LL), which incorporates the advantages of TL and RFP without their drawbacks.\nLike RFP, LL employs a dataset of reference locations but stores them in\nseparate lookup tables with respect to RSS and antenna towers. A query\nobservation is localized by identifying common locations in only associating\nlookup tables. Due to this decentralization, LL is two orders of magnitude\nfaster than RFP, making it particularly scalable for large cities. Moreover, we\nshow that analytically and experimentally, LL achieves higher localization\naccuracy than RFP as well.

In the first part of this thesis, we study the action of mirror\nsymmetry on two-dimensional $\\cN=(2,2)$ effective theories obtained by\ncompactifying Type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Our focus is on\nfourfold geometries with non-trivial three-form cohomology. The couplings of\nthe massless zero-modes arising from an expansion of the three-form\ngauge-potential into these forms depend both on the complex structure\ndeformations and the K\\\"ahler structure deformations of the Calabi-Yau\nfourfold. We argue that two holomorphic functions, called three-form periods,\none for each kind of deformation, capture this information. These are exchanged\nunder mirror symmetry, which allows us to derive them at the large complex\nstructure and large volume point. We discuss the application of the resulting\nexplicit expression to F-theory compactifications and their weak string\ncoupling limit. The second part of this work introduces the mathematical\nmachinery to derive the complete moduli dependence of the periods of\nnon-trivial three-forms for fourfolds realized as hypersurfaces in toric\nambient spaces. It sets the stage to determine Picard-Fuchs-type differential\nequations and integral expressions for these forms. The key tool is the\nobservation that non-trivial three-forms on fourfold hypersurfaces in toric\nambient spaces always stem from divisors that are build out of trees of toric\nsurfaces fibered over Riemann surfaces. The three-form periods are then\nnon-trivially related to the one-form periods of these Riemann surfaces. We\nconclude with two explicit example fourfolds for F-theory compactifications %in\nwhich the three-form periods determine axion decay constants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 10:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

The key in this campaign consists in reducing the domain shift,\ni.e., enforcing the data distributions of the two domains to be similar. A\npopular strategy is to align the marginal distribution in the feature space\nthrough adversarial learning. However, this global alignment strategy does not\nconsider the local category-level feature distribution. A possible consequence\nof the global movement is that some categories which are originally well\naligned between the source and target may be incorrectly mapped. To address\nthis problem, this paper introduces a category-level adversarial network,\naiming to enforce local semantic consistency during the trend of global\nalignment. Our idea is to take a close look at the category-level data\ndistribution and align each class with an adaptive adversarial loss.\nSpecifically, we reduce the weight of the adversarial loss for category-level\naligned features while increasing the adversarial force for those poorly\naligned. In this process, we decide how well a feature is category-level\naligned between source and target by a co-training approach.

One influential formulation of the principle, which\nprohibits fine tuning of bare Standard Model (SM) parameters, rests on the\nassumption that a particular set of values for these parameters constitute the\n\"fundamental parameters\" of the theory, and serve to mathematically define the\ntheory. On the other hand, an old argument by Wetterich suggests that fine\ntuning of bare parameters merely reflects an arbitrary, inconvenient choice of\nexpansion parameters and that the choice of parameters in an EFT is therefore\narbitrary. We argue that these two interpretations of Higgs fine tuning reflect\ndistinct ways of formulating and interpreting effective field theories (EFTs)\nwithin the Wilsonian framework: the first takes an EFT to be defined by a\nsingle set of physical, fundamental bare parameters, while the second takes a\nWilsonian EFT to be defined instead by a whole Wilsonian renormalization group\n(RG) trajectory, associated with a one-parameter class of physically equivalent\nparametrizations.

An important requirement for an approximate\nBayesian inference algorithm is to output high-accuracy posterior mean and\nuncertainty estimates. Classical Monte Carlo methods, particularly Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo, remain the gold standard for approximate Bayesian inference\nbecause they have a robust finite-sample theory and reliable convergence\ndiagnostics. However, alternative methods, which are more scalable or apply to\nproblems where Markov Chain Monte Carlo cannot be used, lack the same\nfinite-data approximation theory and tools for evaluating their accuracy. In\nthis work, we develop a flexible new approach to bounding the error of mean and\nuncertainty estimates of scalable inference algorithms. Our strategy is to\ncontrol the estimation errors in terms of Wasserstein distance, then bound the\nWasserstein distance via a generalized notion of Fisher distance. Unlike\ncomputing the Wasserstein distance, which requires access to the normalized\nposterior distribution, the Fisher distance is tractable to compute because it\nrequires access only to the gradient of the log posterior density. We\ndemonstrate the usefulness of our Fisher distance approach by deriving bounds\non the Wasserstein error of the Laplace approximation and Hilbert coresets.

To guarantee the Quality of Charging Service (QoCS) for each\nreceiver and maximize the overall earning in the PtMP RBC service, we specify\nthe Charging Pricing Strategy (CPS) and develop the High Priority Charge (HPC)\nscheduling algorithm to control the charging order and power allocation. Each\nreceiver is assigned a priority, which is updated dynamically based on its\nState of Charging (SOC) and specified charging power. The receivers with high\npriorities are scheduled to be charged in each time slot.

Relying on simulation analysis, we\ndemonstrate that the HPC algorithm can achieve better QoCS and earning than the\nRound-Robin Charge (RRC) scheduling algorithm.

A typical diversification problem is as follows: Given a finite\nmetric space $(X,d)$ and a parameter $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, find a subset of $k$\nelements of $X$ that has maximum diversity. There are many functions that\nmeasure diversity. One of the most popular measures, called remote-clique, is\nthe sum of the pairwise distances of the chosen elements. In this paper, we\npresent novel results on three widely used diversity measures: Remote-clique,\nremote-star and remote-bipartition.\n  Our main result are polynomial time approximation schemes for these three\ndiversification problems under the assumption that the metric space is\ndoubling. This setting has been discussed in the recent literature. The\nexistence of such a PTAS however was left open.

Factors such as pixelisation,\nimperfect point-spread function (PSF) correction, and pixel noise can all\ndirectly or indirectly lead to biases in shear measurements, and so it can be\nnecessary for shear measurement methods to be calibrated against internal,\nexternal, or simulated data to minimize bias. It is thus important to\nunderstand the nature of this calibration. In this paper, we show that a\ntypical calibration procedure will on average leave no residual additive bias,\nbut will leave a residual multiplicative bias. Additionally, the errors on the\npost-calibration bias parameters will be changed, and on average increased,\nfrom the errors on the pre-calibration measurements of these parameters, but\nthat this is generally worth the benefit in decreasing the expected value of\nthe multiplicative bias. We find that in most typical cases, it is worthwhile\nto apply a first-order bias correction, while a higher-order bias correction is\nonly worthwhile for methods with intrinsically high multiplicative bias ($>10$\nper cent) or when the simulation size is very small ($<10^6$ simulated\ngalaxies).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 15:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

A more sophisticated stochastic strategy,\none-hop targeting, is to select random network neighbors of random individuals;\nthis exploits a version of the friendship paradox, whereby the friend of a\nrandom individual is expected to have more friends than a random individual,\nwith the hope that seeding a behavior at more connected individuals leads to\nmore adoption.

One of the dynamic stabilization mechanisms for plasma\ninstability was proposed in the papers [Phys. Plasmas 19, 024503(2012) and\nreferences therein], based on a perturbation phase control. In general,\ninstabilities emerge from the perturbations of the physical quantity. Normally\nthe perturbation phase is unknown so that the instability growth rate is\ndiscussed. However, if the perturbation phase is known, the instability growth\ncan be controlled by a superimposition of perturbations imposed actively: if\nthe perturbation is introduced by, for example, a driving beam axis oscillation\nor so, the perturbation phase can be controlled and the instability growth is\nmitigated by the superimposition of the growing perturbations. Based on this\nmechanism we present the application results of the dynamic stabilization\nmechanism to the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability and to the filamentation\ninstability as typical examples in this paper. On the other hand, in the paper\n[Comments Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 3, 1(1977)] another mechanism was\nproposed to stabilize the R-T instability based on the strong oscillation of\nacceleration, which was realized by the laser intensity modulation in laser\ninertial fusion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 3131(1993)]. In the latter mechanism, the\ntotal acceleration strongly oscillates, so that the additional oscillating\nforce is added to create a new stable window in the system. Originally the\nlatter mechanism was proposed by P. L. Kapitza, and it was applied to the\nstabilization of an inverted pendulum. In this paper we review the two dynamic\nstabilization mechanisms, and present the application results of the former\ndynamic stabilization mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

This indicates that parallel manipulators\nfabricated using lamination techniques can provide similar performance with\nprototypes made in conventional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 23:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

A\nversion of it, capable of handling arbitrary WDM combs and link structures in\nclosed form, was proposed in 2014. Here we upgrade that formula, to make it\ncapable of handling frequency-dependent dispersion, frequency-dependent loss\nand frequency-dependent gain/loss due to Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS)\namong channels. This way, more challenging and complex network scenarios, like\nthe ones that are being deployed right now, can be dealt with in real-time, to\nthe great advantage of management, control and optimization of such networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 17:39:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 07:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}
