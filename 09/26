First, it extends Moran-Chatterji characterization and generalizes\nRao-Rubin characterization of Poisson distribution to COM-Poisson distribution.\nThen, it defines the COM-type discrete r.v. ${X_\\nu }$ of the discrete random\nvariable $X$. The probability mass function of ${X_\\nu }$ has a link to the\nR\\'enyi entropy and Tsallis entropy of order $\\nu $ of $X$. And then we can get\nthe characterization of Stam inequality for COM-type discrete version Fisher\ninformation. By using the recurrence formula, the property that COM-Poisson\nrandom variables ($\\nu \\ne 1$) is not closed under addition are obtained.\nFinally, under the property of \"not closed under addition\" of COM-Poisson\nrandom variables, a new characterization of Poisson distribution is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 16:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

For relevant magnetic geometries, the frequently\nquoted tertiary instability requires unphysical enhancement of ZF shear and\nthus is irrelevant to the near-marginal, frictionless regime. We show that\nresonant vorticity mixing, which conserves potential enstrophy, enables ZF\nsaturation in the absence of drag, and so is effective in the Dimits up-shift\nregime. Vorticity mixing is incorporated as a nonlinear, self-regulation effect\nin an extended 0D predator--prey model of drift--ZF turbulence. This analysis\ndetermines the saturated ZF shear and shows that the mesoscopic ZF width scales\nas $L_{ZF}\\sim f^{3/16} (1-f)^{1/8} \\rho_s^{5/8} l_0^{3/8}$ in the relevant\nadiabatic limit (i.e., $\\tau_{ck} k_\\|^2 D_\\| \\gg 1$). $f$ is the fraction of\nturbulence energy coupled to ZF and $l_0$ is the mixing length absent ZF\nshears. We calculate and compare the stationary flow and turbulence level in\nfrictionless, weakly frictional, and strongly frictional regimes. In the\nfrictionless limit, the results differ significantly from conventionally quoted\nscalings derived for frictional regimes. The flow is independent of turbulence\nintensity. The turbulence level scales as $E \\sim (\\gamma_L/\\varepsilon_c)^2$,\nwhich defines the extent of the \"near-marginal\" regime to be $\\gamma_L <\n\\varepsilon_c$, for the case of avalanche-induced profile variability. Here,\n$\\varepsilon_c$ is the rate of dissipation of potential enstrophy and\n$\\gamma_L$ is the characteristic linear growth rate of fluctuations. The\nimplications for dynamics near marginality of the strong scaling of saturated\n$E$ with $\\gamma_L$ are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 16:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

This\ntetragonal phase has a highly irregular unit-cell volume versus pressure\ndependence up to ~45 GPa, after which a transformation to a Cmcm post-spinel\nphase is onset. This is attributable to pressure driven Fe-Al site inversion at\nroom temperature, corroborated by signatures in the 57Fe M\\\"ossbauer\nspectroscopy pressure data. At the tetragonal to post-spinel transition, onset\nin the range 45-50 GPa, there is a concurrent emergence of a non-magnetic\nspectral component in the M\\\"ossbauer data at variable cryogenic temperatures.\nThis is interpreted as spin crossover at sixfold coordinated Fe locations\nemanated from site inversion. Spin crossover commences at the end of the\npressure range of the tetragonal phase and progresses in the post-spinel\nstructure. There is also a much steeper volume change dV/V ~ 10% in the range\n45-50 GPa compared to the preceding pressure regime, from the combined effects\nof the structural transition and spin crossover electronic change.

An ideal re-ranker will\nexhibit the following two properties: (a) it should prefer the most relevant\nhypothesis for the given input as the top hypothesis and, (b) the\ninterpretation scores corresponding to each hypothesis produced by the\nre-ranker should be calibrated. Calibration allows the final NLU interpretation\nscore to be comparable across domains. We propose a novel re-ranker strategy\nthat addresses these aspects, while also maintaining domain specific\nmodularity. We design optimization loss functions for such a modularized\nre-ranker and present results on decreasing the top hypothesis error rate as\nwell as maintaining the model calibration. We also experiment with an extension\ninvolving training the domain specific re-rankers on datasets curated\nindependently by each domain to allow further asynchronization. %The proposed\nre-ranker design showcases the following: (i) improved NLU performance over an\nunweighted aggregation strategy, (ii) cross-domain calibrated performance and,\n(iii) support for use cases involving training each re-ranker on datasets\ncurated by each domain independently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 17:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}

For large basis set, the computational bottleneck for large scale\ncalculations is the application of the Fock exchange operator to the\ntime-dependent orbitals. Our main goal is to reduce the frequency of applying\nthe Fock exchange operator, without loss of accuracy. We achieve this by\ncombining the recently developed parallel transport (PT) gauge formalism and\nthe adaptively compressed exchange operator (ACE) formalism. The PT gauge\nyields the slowest possible dynamics among all choices of gauge. When coupled\nwith implicit time integrators such as the Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme, the\nresulting PT-CN scheme can significantly increase the time step from\nsub-attoseconds to 10-100 attoseconds. At each time step $t_{n}$, PT-CN\nrequires the self-consistent solution of the orbitals at time $t_{n+1}$. We use\nACE to delay the update of the Fock exchange operator in this nonlinear system,\nwhile maintaining the same self-consistent solution. We verify the performance\nof the resulting PT-CN-ACE method by computing the absorption spectrum of a\nbenzene molecule and the response of bulk silicon systems to an ultrafast laser\npulse, using the planewave basis set and the HSE functional. We report the\nstrong and weak scaling of the PT-CN-ACE method for silicon systems ranging\nfrom 32 to 1024 atoms, with up to 2048 computational cores. Compared to\nstandard explicit time integrators such as the 4th order Runge-Kutta method\n(RK4), the PT-CN-ACE can reduce the Fock exchange operator application by\nnearly 70 times, thus reduce the overall wall clock time time by 46 times for\nthe system with 1024 atoms.

To address the inevitable `duplicate' landmarks that arise, we\npresent an efficient map-merging framework to detect duplicate constellations\nof landmarks, providing a high-confidence loop-closure mechanism well-suited\nfor object-level SLAM. This approach uses an incrementally-computable\napproximation of landmark uncertainty that only depends on local information in\nthe SLAM graph, avoiding expensive recovery of the full system covariance\nmatrix.

However, despite many investigations, its nature is still very\ncontroversial. Geisler et al.

It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick\ndisk or even the bulge, and both as an open or globular cluster or even the\nremnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present and discuss detailed abundances\nderived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at\nKeck of 17 evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean\n[Fe/H]=+0.313+-0.005, in good agreement with recent estimates, and with no\nindication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected. We also did not\nfind any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in\nGeisler et al. (2012), where a Na variation was claimed. This points to the\npresence of probable systematics in the lower resolution spectra of this very\nhigh metallicity cluster analysed in that work. In fact, we find no evidence\nfor an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE\ndata. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the\nGalactic Bulge and that the proposed association with the Thick Disk is\nunlikely, despite its present Galactic location.

We evaluated 261 Disk Detective\nobjects of interest with imaging with the Robo-AO adaptive optics instrument on\nthe 1.5m telescope at Palomar Observatory and with RetroCam on the 2.5m du Pont\ntelescope at Las Campanas Observatory to search for background objects at\n0.15''-12'' separations from each target. Our analysis of these data lead us to\nreject 7% of targets. Combining this result with statistics from our online\nimage classification efforts implies that at most $7.9\\% \\pm 0.2\\%$ of\nAllWISE-selected infrared excesses are good disk candidates. Applying our false\npositive rates to other surveys, we find that the infrared excess searches of\nMcDonald et al. (2012), McDonald et al. (2017), and Marton et al.

We present 244 disk candidates that have survived vetting by\nfollow-up imaging. Of these, 213 are newly-identified disk systems. Twelve of\nthese are candidate members of comoving pairs based on \\textit{Gaia}\nastrometry, supporting the hypothesis that warm dust is associated with binary\nsystems. We also note the discovery of 22 $\\mu$m excess around two known\nmembers of the Scorpius-Centaurus association, and identify known disk host\nWISEA J164540.79-310226.6 as a likely Sco-Cen member. Thirty-one of these disk\ncandidates are closer than $\\sim 125$ pc (including 27 debris disks), making\nthem good targets for direct imaging exoplanet searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 19:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Based on simple one-dimensional lattice models, we\nnumerically evaluate the normal modes of a spin cycloid or helix produced by\neither Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) or competing exchange (CE) interactions. The\nnormal modes depend on the type of interaction and on whether the\nnearest-neighbor exchange is antiferromagnetic (AF) or ferromagnetic (FM). In\nthe AF/DM and FM/DM cases, there is only a single Goldstone mode; in the AF/CE\nand FM/CE cases, there are three. For FM exchange, the spin oscillations\nproduced by non-Goldstone modes contain a mixture of tangential and transverse\ncomponents. For the DM cases, we compare our numerical results with analytic\nresults in the continuum limit.

We show\nPWA dynamics can be exploited to combine step (1) and (2) into a single step\nthat is tackled using mixed-integer convex programming, which makes the method\nsuitable for dealing with hard constraints. Illustrative examples on\ncontact-based dynamics are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

Here I describe an exceptional set of apparently\ncoordinated changes which occurred in 2011-12, after more localised precursors\nin 2008 and 2010. (1) The large NEBs dark formations progressively disappeared\nuntil none remained. (2) In the sectors of NEBs thus vacated, smaller dark\nfeatures all moved with unprecedented super-fast speeds, which were modulated\nby the few normal features as long as they lasted, and then accelerated\nfurther, reaching 139-151 m/s. (3) Rifts (expanding systems of convective white\nclouds) also disappeared from the NEB. (4) The NEB north half progressively\nfaded (whitened) until there was only a narrow, southerly NEB, narrower and\nfainter than it had been for nearly a century. These changes have several\nprofound implications for understanding the dynamics of the region. First, the\nNEBs took on the same appearance, dynamics, and speed, as the equivalent jet at\n7S (SEBn), supporting the view that the two jets are essentially symmetrical,\nwith an underlying jet in the range 150-170 m/s. Secondly, the manifestation of\nthis jet at the surface is normally suppressed by the presence of large\nslow-moving formations, which are probably Rossby waves. Thirdly, the loss of\nthe large dark formations and the narrowing of the belt may have been promoted\nby the decline of convective rift activity. Fourthly, these changes seem to\nrepresent a reversion to the situation that existed before 1912, when such\nappearances were common and were followed cyclically by vigorous NEB Revivals.\nIndeed, just such a Revival would ensue in 2012.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

Foreground separation is made possible by their intrinsic\nspectral smoothness, making them distinguishable from spectrally complex\ncosmological signal even though they are ~5 orders of magnitude brighter.\nPrecisely calibrated radio interferometers are essential to maintaining the\nsmoothness and thus separability of the foregrounds. One powerful calibration\nstrategy is to use redundant measurements between pairs of antennas with the\nsame physical separation in order to solve for each antenna's spectral response\nwithout reference to a sky model. This strategy is being employed by the\nHydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a large radio telescope in South\nAfrica that is now observing while being built out to 350 14-m dishes. However,\nthe deviations from perfect redundancy inherent in any real radio telescope\ncomplicate the calibration problem. Using simulations of HERA, we show how\ncalibration with antenna-to-antenna variations in dish construction and\nplacement generally lead to spectral structure in otherwise smooth foregrounds\nthat significantly reduces the number of cosmological modes available to a 21\ncm measurement.

The design of\nquantum circuits for integer division has caught the attention of researchers\nand designs have been proposed in the literature.

This paper proposes a model-based approach to assess\nagreement of two measuring methods for paired repeated binary measurements\nunder the scenario when the agreement between two measuring methods and the\nagreement among raters are required to be studied in a unified framework. Based\nupon the generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), the decision on the adequacy\nof interchangeable use is made by testing the equality of fixed effects of\nmethods. Approaches for assessing method agreement, such as the Bland-Altman\ndiagram and Cohen's kappa, are also developed for repeated binary measurements\nbased upon the latent variables in GLMMs. We assess our novel model-based\napproach by simulation studies and a real clinical research application, in\nwhich patients are evaluated repeatedly for delirium with two validated\nscreening methods: the Confusion Assessment Method and the 3-Minute Diagnostic\nInterview for Confusion Assessment Method.

A forward filter (suitable for real-time\ntracking) and backward MAP sampling step (suitable for MAP trajectory inference\nand map matching) are described.

This is\nnecessary for optimal path planning and safe navigation. To accomplish this\nover an extended period of time, the global map requires long-term maintenance.\nThis includes the addition of newly observable features and the removal of\ntransient features belonging to dynamic objects. The latter is especially\nimportant for the long-term use of the map as matching against a map with\nfeatures that no longer exist can result in incorrect data associations, and\nconsequently erroneous localisation. This paper addresses the problem of\nremoving features from the map that correspond to objects that are no longer\nobservable/present in the environment. This is achieved by assigning a single\nscore which depends on the geometric distribution and characteristics when the\nfeatures are re-detected (or not) on different occasions. Our approach not only\neliminates ephemeral features, but also can be used as a reduction algorithm\nfor highly dense maps.

We collect the fatty acid abundances measured in various carbonaceous\nchondrites from the literature and analyze them for patterns and correlations.\nFatty acids in meteorites include straight-chain and branched-chain\nmonocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids up to 12 carbons in length---fatty acids\nwith at least 8 carbons are required to form vesicles, and modern cell\nmembranes employ lipids with ~12--20 carbons. To understand the origin of\nmeteoritic fatty acids, we search the literature for abiotic fatty acid\nreaction pathways and create a candidate list of 11 reactions that could\npotentially produce these fatty acids in meteorite parent bodies.\nStraight-chain monocarboxylic acids (SCMA) are the dominant fatty acids in\nmeteorites, followed by branched-chain monocarboxylic acids (BCMA). SCMA are\nmost abundant in CM2 and Tagish Lake (ungrouped) meteorites, ranging on average\nfrom 10$^2$ ppb to 4x10$^5$ ppb, and 10$^4$ ppb to 5x10$^6$ ppb, respectively.\nIn CM, CV, and Tagish Lake meteorites, SCMA abundances generally decrease with\nincreasing carbon chain length. Conversely, SCMA abundances in CR meteorites\npeak at 5 and 6 carbons in length, and decrease on either side of this peak.\nThis unique CR fatty acid distribution may hint at terrestrial contamination,\nor that certain fatty acid reactions mechanisms are active in different\nmeteorite parent bodies (planetesimals).

The magnetic state of matter, assembled by ordering the\nelectron's quantum spin property, represents a sizeable source of built-in\nenergy.

The presence of this path\nin our experiment, which also generates very high spintronic performance, is\nconfirmed by analytical and ab-initio calculations.

Finally, we remark that the disformal\ncoupling gives rise to a contribution to the perihelion advance which varies\nquadratically with the mass of the heavy body, leading to possible strong\neffects for stars in the vicinity of astrophysical black holes. For neutron\nstars in a binary system, the disformal effects vary as the quartic power of\nthe size of the orbit which might lead to interesting consequences in the\ninspiralling phase prior to a merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 08:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Even though plenty of standard techniques exist to assess\nstatistical significance, connecting it to practical significance is not\nstraightforward or routinely done; indeed, only a few empirical studies in\nsoftware engineering assess practical significance in a principled and\nsystematic way.\n  In this paper, we argue that Bayesian data analysis provides suitable tools\nto assess practical significance rigorously. We demonstrate our claims in a\ncase study comparing different test techniques. The case study's data was\npreviously analyzed (Afzal et al., 2015) using standard techniques focusing on\nstatistical significance. Here, we build a multilevel model of the same data,\nwhich we fit and validate using Bayesian techniques. Our method is to apply\ncumulative prospect theory on top of the statistical model to quantitatively\nconnect our statistical analysis output to a practically meaningful context.\nThis is then the basis both for assessing and arguing for practical\nsignificance.\n  Our study demonstrates that Bayesian analysis provides a technically rigorous\nyet practical framework for empirical software engineering. A substantial side\neffect is that any uncertainty in the underlying data will be propagated\nthrough the statistical model, and its effects on practical significance are\nmade clear.\n  Thus, in combination with cumulative prospect theory, Bayesian analysis\nsupports seamlessly assessing practical significance in an empirical software\nengineering context, thus potentially clarifying and extending the relevance of\nresearch for practitioners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 08:39:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 10:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 14:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 08:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 08:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 13:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

To exclude contact resistance input Van der Pauw method is used.\nObtained I-V curves are diode type with extremely low voltage drop in forward\ndirection and reduced reverse current. Experimental I-V curves are fitted to\nthe Shockley equation and ideality factor is found to be in the range of\n0.2-0.14. Such a low values confirm that p-p(v) junction is fundamentally\ndifferent from the conventional p-n junction. This difference is ascribed to\nG-doping which, unlike conventional doping, is external voltage dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 09:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

Different techniques have been proposed,\ncombining collaborative, content, social, and geographical signals; however it\nis not trivial to decide which tech- nique works best, since this may depend on\nthe data density or the amount of activity logged for each user or item. At the\nsame time, cross-domain strategies have been exploited in the recommender\nsystems literature when dealing with (very) sparse situations, such as those\ninherently arising when recommendations are produced based on information from\na single city.\n  In this paper, we address the problem of venue recommendation from a novel\nperspective: applying cross-domain recommenda- tion techniques considering each\ncity as a different domain. We perform an experimental comparison of several\nrecommendation techniques in a temporal split under two conditions:\nsingle-domain (only information from the target city is considered) and cross-\ndomain (information from many other cities is incorporated into the\nrecommendation algorithm). For the latter, we have explored two strategies to\ntransfer knowledge from one domain to another: testing the target city and\ntraining a model with information of the k cities with more ratings or only\nusing the k closest cities.\n  Our results show that, in general, applying cross-domain by proximity\nincreases the performance of the majority of the recom- menders in terms of\nrelevance. This is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, where so many\ndomains (eight) are combined in the tourism context where a temporal split is\nused, and thus we expect these results could provide readers with an overall\npicture of what can be achieved in a real-world environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 09:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

Under another set of\nconditions, BH99 showed the existence of the limiting distribution of the\nestimator.\n  This article establishes the strong consistency of the depth induced median\nwithout any of the stringent conditions in BH99, and proves the existence of\nthe limiting distribution of the estimator by sufficient conditions and an\napproach different from BH99.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 10:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 18:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 01:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 22:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

Our aim is to\ncharacterize the close (up to 2.5 au) giant planet (GP) and brown dwarf (BD)\npopulation around AF MS stars and compare this population to stars with\ndifferent masses. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph located on the 1.93m\ntelescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence to observe 125 northern, MS AF\ndwarfs. We used our dedicated SAFIR software to compute the RV and other\nspectroscopic observables. We characterized the detected sub-stellar companions\nand computed the GP and BD occurrence rates combining the present SOPHIE survey\nand a similar HARPS survey. We present new data on two known planetary systems\naround the F5-6V dwarfs HD16232 and HD113337.

Based on\n225 targets observed with SOPHIE or HARPS, we constraint the BD frequency\nwithin 2-3 au around AF stars to be below 4 percents (1-sigma). For\nJupiter-mass GP within 2-3 au (periods below 1000 days), we found the\noccurrence rate to be 3.7 (+3/-1) percents around AF stars with masses below\n1.5 solar masses, and to be below 6 percents around AF stars with masses above\n1.5 solar masses.

One disadvantage concerning a numerical simulation is that\nB-Rep models are not necessarily watertight. These 'dirty geometries' cause\nmajor difficulties in computational analysis because even basic geometric\noperations such as point-in-membership tests fail, not to mention meshing as\nrequired by classical boundary conforming finite element methods.\nAlternatively, objects may be represented by Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG),\nwhich is strongly related to Procedural Modeling (PM). In this context, the\nmodel is created using Boolean operations on primitives. The modeling process\nis then either stored as a sequence (PM), or as a construction tree (CSG). In\ncontrast to B-Rep models, CSG models are intrinsically water-tight. To run a\nfinite element simulation on a water-tight CSG model, two alternatives are\npossible: (i) it can either be converted to a B-Rep-model to obtain a finite\nelement mesh or (ii) its implicit description can be used directly by applying\nan embedded domain approach, like the Finite Cell Method (FCM).

CIG 96 (NGC 864) is a representative case reaching a\n16% level. Our aim is to investigate the HI asymmetries of this spiral galaxy\nand what processes have triggered the star-forming regions observed in the XUV\npseudoring. We performed deep optical observations at CAHA 1.23m, 2.2m and VST\ntelescopes. We reach surface brightness (SB) limits of mu_2.2m = 27.5 mag\narcsec-2 (Cous R) and mu_VST = 28.7mag arcsec-2 (r) that show the XUV\npseudoring of the galaxy in detail.

To overcome this challenge, we have developed a multiparametric imaging\nradiomic framework termed MPRAD for extraction of radiomic features from high\ndimensional datasets.

So far, coupled\noscillator research focused on phase synchronized solutions. Yet, global\nconstraints on oscillators may forbid synchronized state, rendering phase\nbalanced states as the relevant stable state. If for example oscillators are\ndriving the contractions of a fluid filled volume, conservation of fluid volume\nconstraints oscillators to balanced states as characterized by a vanishing\nKuramoto order parameter. It has previously been shown that stable, balanced\npatterns in the Kuramoto model exist on circulant graphs. However, which\nnon-circulant graphs first of all allow for balanced states and what\ncharacterizes the balanced states is unknown. Here, we derive rules of how to\nbuild non-circulant, planar graphs allowing for balanced states from the simple\ncycle graph by adding loops or edges to it. We thereby identify different\nclasses of small planar networks allowing for balanced states. Investigating\nthe balanced states' characteristics, we find that the variance in basin\nstability scales linearly with the size of the graph for these networks. We\nintroduce the balancing ratio as a new order parameter based on the basin\nstability approach to classify balanced states on networks and evaluate it\nanalytically for a subset of the network classes. Our results offer an\nanalytical description of non-circulant graphs supporting stable, balanced\nstates and may thereby help to understand the topological requirements on\noscillator networks under global constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 14:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

In this paper, we develop a two-layer Model Predictive Control (MPC)\nstrategy for battery thermal and energy management of electric vehicle (EV),\naiming at improving fuel economy through real-time prediction and optimization.\nIn the first layer, the long-term traffic flow information and an approximate\nmodel reflective of the relatively slow battery temperature dynamics are\nleveraged to minimize energy consumption required for battery cooling while\nmaintaining the battery temperature within the desired operating range. In the\nsecond layer, the scheduled battery thermal and state of charge (SOC)\ntrajectories planned to achieve long-term battery energy-optimal thermal\nbehavior are used as the reference over a short horizon to regulate the battery\ntemperature.

The simulation results show that, depending on the\ndriving cycle, the proposed two-layer MPC is able to save 2.8-7.9% of the\nbattery energy compared to the traditional rule-based controller in connected\nand automated vehicle (CAV) operation scenario. Moreover, as compared to a\nsingle layer MPC with a long horizon, the two-layer structure of the proposed\nMPC solution reduces significantly the computing effort without compromising\nthe performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 14:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

Recently, we added to\nthis list by showing how a machine learning algorithm (a so-called learner)\ncombined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the\nrealm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices. Among other\napplications, semiconductor QDs are a candidate system for building quantum\ncomputers. The present-day tuning techniques for bringing the QD devices into a\ndesirable configuration suitable for quantum computing that rely on heuristics\ndo not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for\neven near-term quantum computing demonstrations. Establishing a reliable\nprotocol for tuning that does not rely on the gross-scale heuristics developed\nby experimentalists is thus of great importance. To implement the machine\nlearning-based approach, we constructed a dataset of simulated QD device\ncharacteristics, such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus\nthe applied electrostatic gate voltages. Here, we describe the methodology for\ngenerating the dataset, as well as its validation in training convolutional\nneural networks. We show that the learner's accuracy in recognizing the state\nof a device is ~96.5 % in both current- and charge-sensor-based training.

A main challenge for soliton\ngeneration, in particular in ultra-high-Q resonators, is the sudden change of\ncirculating intracavity power during the onset of soliton generation. This\nsudden power change requires precise control of the seed laser frequency and\npower or fast control of the resonator temperature. Here, we report a robust\nand simple way to increase the stability range of the soliton regime by using\nan auxiliary laser that passively stabilizes the intracavity power. In our\nexperiments with fused silica resonators, we are able to extend the pump laser\nfrequency stability range of microresonator solitons by two orders of\nmagnitude, which enables soliton generation by slow and manual tuning of the\npump laser into resonance and at unprecedented low power levels. Both single-\nand multi-soliton mode-locked states are generated in a 1.3-mm-diameter fused\nsilica microrod resonator with a free spectral range of ~50.6 GHz, at a 1554 nm\npump wavelength at threshold powers <3 mW. Moreover, with a smaller\n230-{\\mu}m-diameter microrod, we demonstrate soliton generation at 780 {\\mu}W\nthreshold power. The passive enhancement of the stability range of\nmicroresonator solitons paves the way for robust and low threshold microcomb\nsystems with substantially relaxed stability requirements for the pump laser\nsource. In addition, this method could be useful in a wider range of\nmicroresonator applications that require reduced sensitivity to external\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 14:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

The standard approach to this question is to model a given\nbioelectrical network as a system of differential equations and then explore\nits behavior using simulation techniques.

These formulae demonstrate how, by playing the role of\nthe spatial curvature, or that of the cosmological constant, torsion can\ndrastically change the evolution of the classic homogeneous and isotropic\nFriedmann universes. In particular, torsion alone can lead to exponential\nexpansion. For instance, in the presence of torsion, the Milne and the\nEinstein-de Sitter universes evolve like the de Sitter model. We also show\nthat, by changing the expansion rate of the early universe, torsion can affect\nthe primordial nucleosynthesis of helium-4. We use this sensitivity to impose\nstrong cosmological bounds on the relative strength of the associated torsion\nfield, requiring that its ratio to the Hubble expansion rate lies in the narrow\ninterval ($-0.005813,\\,+0.019370$) around zero. Interestingly, the introduction\nof torsion can \\textit{reduce} the production of primordial helium-4, unlike\nother changes to the standard thermal history of an isotropic universe.\nFinally, turning to static spacetimes, we find that there exist torsional\nanalogues of the classic Einstein static universe, with all three types of\nspatial geometry.

By storing parts of\nthe popular files at the mobile users, users can locate some of their requested\nfiles in their own caches or the caches at their neighbors. In the latter case,\nwhen a user receives files from its neighbors, device-to-device(D2D)\ncommunication is performed. D2D communication underlaid with cellular networks\nis also a new paradigm for the upcoming wireless systems. By allowing a pair of\nadjacent D2D users to communicate directly, D2D communication can achieve\nhigher throughput, better energy efficiency and lower traffic delay. In this\nwork, we propose an efficient learning-based caching algorithm operating\ntogether with a non-parametric estimator to minimize the average transmission\ndelay in D2D-enabled cellular networks. It is assumed that the system does not\nhave any prior information regarding the popularity of the files, and the\nnon-parametric estimator is aimed at learning the intensity function of the\nfile requests. An algorithm is devised to determine the best <file,user> pairs\nthat provide the best delay improvement in each loop to form a caching policy\nwith very low transmission delay and high throughput. This algorithm is also\nextended to address a more general scenario, in which the distributions of\nfading coefficients and values of system parameters potentially change over\ntime. Via numerical results, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is\nverified by comparing it with a naive algorithm, in which all users simply\ncache their favorite files, and by comparing with a probabilistic algorithm, in\nwhich the users cache a file with a probability that is proportional to its\npopularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 15:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-30"}

Measurements of\ngeodesic entropy allow for the characterization of the structural information\nof a network that takes into account the distinct role of each node into the\nnetwork topology. The measurement and characterization of this structural\ninformation has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of sustained\nactivity and other emergent behaviors in networks, such as self-organized\ncriticality sometimes seen in such contexts. We apply these concepts and\nmethods to study the effects of how the psychedelic Ayahuasca affects the\nfunctional connectivity of the human brain. We show that the geodesic entropy\nis able to differentiate the functional networks of the human brain in two\ndifferent states of consciousness in the resting state: (i) the ordinary waking\nstate and (ii) a state altered by ingestion of the Ayahuasca. The entropy of\nthe nodes of brain networks from subjects under the influence of Ayahuasca\ndiverge significantly from those of the ordinary waking state. The functional\nbrain networks from subjects in the altered state have, on average, a larger\ngeodesic entropy compared to the ordinary state. We conclude that geodesic\nentropy is a useful tool for analyzing complex networks and discuss how and why\nit may bring even further valuable insights into the study of the human brain\nand other empirical networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

While the way in which\nplayers choose their actions depending on such intentions has been investigated\nin game theory, how dynamic changes in intentions by mutually reading others'\nintentions are incorporated into game theory has not been explored. We present\na novel formulation of game theory in which players read others' intentions and\nchange their own through an iterated game. Here, intention is given as a\nfunction of the other's action and the own action to be taken accordingly as\nthe dependent variable, while the mutual recognition of intention is\nrepresented as the functional dynamics. It is shown that a player suffers no\ndisadvantage when he/she recognizes the other's intention, whereas the\nfunctional dynamics reach equilibria in which both players' intentions are\noptimized. These cover a classical Nash and Stackelberg equilibria but we\nextend them in this study: Novel equilibria exist depending on the degree of\nmutual recognition. Moreover, the degree to which each player recognizes the\nother can also differ. This formulation is applied to resource competition,\nduopoly, and prisoner's dilemma games.

Ethical topics are\ncomplex, with excessively verbose accounts of mental models and intensely\ningrained philosophical assumptions. From practical experience, in teaching\nethics for software engineering students, an explanation of ethics alone often\ncannot provide insights of behavior and thought for students. Additionally, it\nseems that there has been no exploration into the development of a conceptual\npresentation of ethics that appeals to computer engineers. This is particularly\nclear in the area of software engineering, which focuses on software and\nassociated tools such as algorithms, diagramming, documentation, modeling and\ndesign as applied to various types of data and conceptual artifacts. It seems\nthat software engineers look at ethical materials as a collection of ideas and\nnotions that lack systemization and uniformity. Accordingly, this paper\nexplores a thinging schematization for ethical theories that can serve a role\nsimilar to that of modeling languages (e.g., UML). In this approach, thinging\nmeans actualization (existence, presence, being) of things and mechanisms that\ndefine a boundary around some region of ethically related reality, separating\nit from everything else. The resultant diagrammatic representation then\ndeveloped to model the process of making ethical decisions in that region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 18:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

Nonetheless, the main focus has been the\ndevelopment of more sophisticated models and the incorporation of different\nexpressive modalities (e. g., speech, face, and physiology). In this paper,\nmotivated by the benefit of difficulty awareness in a human learning procedure,\nwe propose a novel machine learning framework, namely, Dynamic Difficulty\nAwareness Training (DDAT), which sheds fresh light on the research -- directly\nexploiting the difficulties in learning to boost the machine learning process.\nThe DDAT framework consists of two stages: information retrieval and\ninformation exploitation. In the first stage, we make use of the reconstruction\nerror of input features or the annotation uncertainty to estimate the\ndifficulty of learning specific information. The obtained difficulty level is\nthen used in tandem with original features to update the model input in a\nsecond learning stage with the expectation that the model can learn to focus on\nhigh difficulty regions of the learning process. We perform extensive\nexperiments on a benchmark database (RECOLA) to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed framework. The experimental results show that our approach\noutperforms related baselines as well as other well-established time-continuous\nemotion prediction systems, which suggests that dynamically integrating the\ndifficulty information for neural networks can help enhance the learning\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 07:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

Based on full-scale\nnumerical simulations on a class of such materials, an ansatz is proposed that\nallows to decompose the kinematics into three parts, i.e. a smooth mean\ndisplacement field, a long-range correlated fluctuating field, and a local\nmicrofluctuation part. With this decomposition, a homogenized solution is\ndefined by ensemble averaging the solutions obtained from a family of\ntranslated microstructural realizations. Minimizing the resulting homogenized\nenergy, a micromorphic continuum emerges in terms of the average displacement\nand the amplitude of the patterning long-range microstructural fluctuation\nfields. Since full integration of the ensemble averaged global energy (and\nhence also the corresponding Euler--Lagrange equations) is computationally\nprohibitive, a more efficient approximative computational framework is\ndeveloped. The framework relies on local energy density approximations in the\nneighbourhood of the considered Gauss integration points, while taking into\naccount the smoothness properties of the effective fields and periodicity of\nthe microfluctuation pattern. Finally, the implementation of the proposed\nmethodology is briefly outlined and its performance is demonstrated by\ncomparing its predictions against full scale simulations of a representative\nexample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 19:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}
