In this paper, we present\ncondition-residuum-diagrams. By plotting the residuum resulting from the\nunmixing and reconstruction and the condition number of various EM sets, the\nresulting diagram provides insight into the behavior of the spectral unmixing\nunder a varying amount of endmembers (EMs). Furthermore, we utilize\ncondition-residuum-diagrams to realize an EM reduction algorithm that starts\nwith an initially extracted, over-complete EM set. An over-complete EM set\ncommonly exhibits a good unmixing result, i.e. a lower reconstruction residuum,\nbut due to its partial redundancy, the unmixing gets numerically unstable, i.e.\nthe unmixed abundances values are less reliable. Our greedy reduction scheme\nimproves the EM set by reducing the condition number, i.e. enhancing the set's\nstability, while keeping the reconstruction error as low as possible. The\nresulting set sequence gives hint to the optimal EM set and its size. We\ndemonstrate the benefit of our condition-residuum-diagram and reduction scheme\non well-studied datasets with known reference EM set sizes for several\nwell-known EE algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 16:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-27"}

Despite impressive progress, these\nsystems are known to be vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as accidental\nor adversarial bumps that make them drop the manipulated object. They also tend\nto be distracted by visual disturbances such as objects moving in the robot's\nfield of view, even if the disturbance does not physically prevent the\nexecution of the task. In this paper, we propose an approach for augmenting a\ndeep visuomotor policy trained through demonstrations with Task Focused visual\nAttention (TFA). The manipulation task is specified with a natural language\ntext such as `move the red bowl to the left'. This allows the visual attention\ncomponent to concentrate on the current object that the robot needs to\nmanipulate. We show that even in benign environments, the TFA allows the policy\nto consistently outperform a variant with no attention mechanism. More\nimportantly, the new policy is significantly more robust: it regularly recovers\nfrom severe physical disturbances (such as bumps causing it to drop the object)\nfrom which the baseline policy, i.e. with no visual attention, almost never\nrecovers. In addition, we show that the proposed policy performs correctly in\nthe presence of a wide class of visual disturbances, exhibiting a behavior\nreminiscent of human selective visual attention experiments. Our proposed\napproach consists of a VAE-GAN network which encodes the visual input and feeds\nit to a Motor network that moves the robot joints. Also, our approach benefits\nfrom a teacher network for the TFA that leverages textual input command to\nrobustify the visual encoder against various types of disturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 16:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 23:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

The latter can be expressed through\nthe quark mass ratio $Q^2 = (m_s^2 - \\hat{m}^2)/(m_d^2 - m_u^2)$. The main\nobject of this thesis is to analyse the decay $\\eta \\to 3 \\pi$ using dispersion\nrelations in order to extract $Q$ as well as other physical quantities. The\ndispersion relations are a set of integral equations that lead to a\nrepresentation of the decay amplitude in terms of four unknown subtraction\nconstants. We apply two different methods to determine these. Following the\nprocedure of Anisovich and Leutwyler, we match our dispersive representation to\nthe one-loop result from chiral perturbation theory, thus updating their old\nanalysis. In addition, we also make use of the recent experimental\ndetermination of the Dalitz distribution by the KLOE collaboration to obtain\ninformation on the subtraction constants.

Accurately and efficiently describing the complicated\nprecessional dynamics of the various angular momenta of the system in these\nwaveform models is the object of active investigation. One of the key models\nextensively used in the analysis of LIGO and Virgo data is the\nsingle-precessing-spin waveform model IMRPhenomPv2. In this article we present\na new model IMRPhenomPv3 which includes the effects of two independent spins in\nthe precession dynamics. Whereas IMRPhenomPv2 utilizes a single-spin\nfrequency-dependent post-Newtonian rotation to describe precession effects, the\nimproved model, IMRPhenomPv3, employs a double-spin rotation that is based on\nrecent developments in the description of precessional dynamics. Besides\ndouble-spin precession, the improved model benefits from a more accurate\ndescription of precessional effects. We validate our new model against a large\nset of precessing numerical-relativity simulations. We find that IMRPhenomPv3\nhas better agreement with the inspiral portion of precessing binary-black-hole\nsimulations and is more robust across a larger region of the parameter space\nthan IMRPhenomPv2. As a first application we analyse, for the first time, the\ngravitational-wave event GW151226 with a waveform model that describes two-spin\nprecession. Within statistical uncertainty our results are consistent with\npublished results. IMRPhenomPv3 will allow studies of the measurability of\nindividual spins of binary black holes using GWs and can be used as a\nfoundation upon which to build further improvements, such as modeling\nprecession through merger, extending to higher multipoles, and including tidal\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 16:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

Moreover, many factors influence VQA. Compression of video\ncontent, while necessary for minimising transmission and storage requirements,\nintroduces distortions which can have detrimental effects on the perceived\nquality. Especially when dealing with modern video coding standards, it is\nextremely difficult to model the effects of compression due to the\nunpredictability of encoding on different content types. Moreover, transmission\nalso introduces delays and other distortion types which affect the perceived\nquality. Therefore, it would be highly beneficial to accurately predict the\nperceived quality of video to be distributed over modern content distribution\nplatforms, so that specific actions could be undertaken to maximise the Quality\nof Experience (QoE) of the users. Traditional VQA techniques based on feature\nextraction and modelling may not be sufficiently accurate. In this paper, a\nnovel Deep Learning (DL) framework is introduced for effectively predicting VQA\nof video content delivery mechanisms based on end-to-end feature learning. The\nproposed framework is based on Convolutional Neural Networks, taking into\naccount compression distortion as well as transmission delays.

However, there\nis a limit on how much PV can be hosted by a microgrid. High penetration of PVs\ncan potentially put the microgrid at operational risks including but not\nlimited to over and under voltages, excessive line losses, overloading of\ntransformers and feeders, and protection failure. To avoid such potential\nnegative impacts, the concept of hosting capacity is introduced and used. The\nhosting capacity is defined as the total capacity of DERs that can be\nintegrated into a given feeder/microgrid without exceeding operational\nrestrictions and/or requiring system upgrades. Hosting capacity studies are\nprimarily done based on steadystate analyses. However, in case of microgrids\nand when transitioning between grid-connected and islanded modes, dynamic\noperation becomes more restrictive than steady-state operation and thus is\nworthy of detailed investigation to provide a better understanding of the\namount of DER that the microgrid can host.

All proto-BDs show\na large CN/HCN abundance ratio of >20, and a HNC/HCN abundance ratio close to\nor larger than unity. The enhanced CN/HCN ratios can be explained by high UV\nflux originating from an active accretion zone in the proto-BDs. The larger\nthan unity HNC/HCN ratio for the proto-BDs is likely caused by a combination of\nlow temperature and high density. Both CN and HNC show a flat distribution with\nCO, indicating that these species can survive in regions where CO is depleted.\nWe have investigated the correlations in the molecular abundances of these\nspecies for the proto-BDs with Class 0/I protostars. We find tentative trends\nof CN (HCN) abundances being about an order of magnitude higher (lower) in the\nproto-BDs compared to protostars. HNC for the proto-BDs shows a nearly constant\nabundance unlike the large spread of ~2 orders of magnitude seen for the\nprotostars. Also notable is a rise in the HNC/HCN abundance ratio for the\nlowest luminosity objects, suggesting that this ratio is higher under\nlow-temperature environments.

Despite its\nwide applicability, deterministic solution of the Boltzmann equation presents a\nhuge computational challenge, and often the collision operator is simplified\nfor practical reasons.

These near or super-Eddington outer envelopes represent a\nlong standing challenge for calculating the evolution of massive stars in one\ndimension, a situation that limits our understanding of the stellar progenitors\nof some of the most exciting and energetic explosions in the universe. In\nparticular, the proximity to the Eddington limit has been the suspected cause\nfor the variability, large mass loss rate and giant eruptions of an enigmatic\nclass of massive stars: the luminous blue variables (LBVs). When in quiescence,\nLBVs are usually found on the hot ($T_{eff} \\approx 2 - 4 \\times 10^4$ K) S Dor\ninstability strip. While in outburst, most LBVs stay on the cold S Dor\ninstability strip with a $T_{eff} \\approx 9000$ K. Here we show that physically\nrealistic three dimensional global radiation hydrodynamic simulations of\nradiation dominated massive stars with the largest supercomputers in the world\nnaturally reproduce many observed properties of LBVs, specifically their\nlocation in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and their episodic mass loss\nwith rates of $10^{-7}-10^{-5} M_{\\odot}/yr$. The helium opacity peak is found\nto play an important role to determine these properties, which is not realized\nin the traditional one dimensional models of massive stars. The simulations\nalso predict that convection causes irregular envelope oscillations and 10-30%\nbrightness variations on a typical timescale of a few days. The variability is\nmore prominent in our models that are on the cool part of the S Dor\ninstability.

An important avenue to understand the\nformation of these jets is by characterising the systems and circumstances from\nwhich they are launched. Whenever a black hole or neutron star accretes matter,\nit appears to inevitably result in the launching of a jet, the only exception\nbeing the most common type of accreting neutron stars: those with strong ($B\n\\geq 10^{12}$ G) magnetic fields. This exception has created the paradigm that\nstrong magnetic fields inhibit the formation of jets. Here, we report the\ndiscovery of a jet launched by a strongly-magnetised neutron star that is\naccreting above the Eddington limit, disproving this long-standing paradigm.\nThe radio luminosity of the jet is two orders of magnitude fainter than seen in\nother neutron stars, implying an important role for the neutron star's\nproperties in regulating jet power. This jet detection necessitates fundamental\nrevision of current neutron star jet models and opens up new tests of jet\ntheory for all accreting systems. It also shows that the strong magnetic fields\nof ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars do not prevent such sources from launching\njets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 19:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 11:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

We perform numerical integrations of planet pairs\nembedded in planetesimal disks to assess the conditions for which divergent,\nplanetesimal-driven migration occurs and gaps form within the disk. Gap widths\nand the migration rate of planets within a pair depend on both disk mass and\nthe degree to which the planets share disk material.

However, their computational complexity increases\nsignificantly with the dimensionality of the motion planning problem. Adaptive\nsampling is one of the ways to speed up SMPs by sampling a particular region of\na configuration space that is more likely to contain an optimal path solution.\nAlthough there are a wide variety of algorithms for adaptive sampling, they\nrely on hand-crafted heuristics; furthermore, their performance decreases\nsignificantly in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present a neural\nnetwork-based adaptive sampler for motion planning called Deep Sampling-based\nMotion Planner (DeepSMP). DeepSMP generates samples for SMPs and enhances their\noverall speed significantly while exhibiting efficient scalability to\nhigher-dimensional problems. DeepSMP's neural architecture comprises of a\nContractive AutoEncoder which encodes given workspaces directly from a raw\npoint cloud data, and a Dropout-based stochastic deep feedforward neural\nnetwork which takes the workspace encoding, start and goal configuration, and\niteratively generates feasible samples for SMPs to compute end-to-end\ncollision-free optimal paths.

Inspired by real auditing networks, we pose our problem for\narbitrary graphs and consider corruption through a computational lens. We\nidentify a key combinatorial parameter of the graph $m(G)$, which is the\nminimal number of corrupted agents needed to prevent the central agency from\nidentifying a single truthful node. We give an efficient (in fact, linear time)\nalgorithm for the central agency to identify a truthful node that is successful\nwhenever the number of corrupt nodes is less than $m(G)/2$.

This variation is especially\nimportant from a driver's perspective: if a platform's drivers experience\nsystematic disparities in earnings because of variation in their riders'\ndestinations, they may perceive the pricing model as inequitable. This\nperception can exacerbate search frictions if it leads drivers to avoid\nlocations where they believe they may be assigned \"unlucky\" fares. To\ncharacterize any such systematic disparities in productivity, we develop an\nanalytic framework with three key components. First, we propose a productivity\nmetric that looks two consecutive trips ahead, thus capturing the effect on\nexpected earnings of market conditions at drivers' drop-off locations. Second,\nwe develop a natural experiment by analyzing trips with a common origin but\nvarying destinations, thus isolating purely spatial effects on productivity.\nThird, we apply a spatial denoising method that allows us to work with raw\nspatial information exhibiting high levels of noise and sparsity, without\nhaving to aggregate data into large, low-resolution spatial zones. By applying\nour framework to data on more than 1.4 million rides in Austin, Texas, we find\nsignificant spatial variation in ride-sourcing driver productivity and search\nfrictions. Drivers at the same location experienced disparities in productivity\nafter being dispatched on trips with different destinations, with origin-based\nsurge pricing increasing these earnings disparities. Our results show that trip\ndistance is the dominant factor in driver productivity: short trips yielded\nlower productivity, even when ending in areas with high demand.

It is found that\nthe nanoscale building triangular-pyramids turn round preferentially at the\nsharp angles and/or coalesce with their contacting ones by directional\ndiffusion and plastic flow of atoms, which are driven by the\nnonuniformly-distributed surface nanocurvature. As a result, the triangular\npyramids become quasi-sphere shape and the PNF evolves into a big, dense\nparticles film. It is also observed that the heating or thermal activation\neffect efficiently promotes the reduction or oxidation of Cu2O pyramids and the\ncrystallization or growth of the as-achieved Cu or CuO grains. The above\nphysical and chemical instabilities or changes at the nanoscale of Cu2O PNFs\ncan be well accounted for by the combined mechanism of nanocurvature effect and\nthermal activation effect. The nanocurvature effect can lower the energy\nbarrier for the atom diffusion or plastic flow and lower the activation energy\nfor the chemical reactions, while the thermal activation effect can supply the\nrequired kinetic energy or activation energy and make the atomic\ntransportations and reactions kinetically possible. The findings reveal the\nevolution laws of morphology, crystal structure and composition of triangular\npyramids-like Cu2O PNF during heating treatments, which can further be extended\nto other types of Cu2O PNFs. Also, the findings have important implications for\nthe nanoinstabilities of Cu2O PNFs-based devices, especially those working at a\nhigh temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 03:34:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 15:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

For current blockchain systems, as more nodes join the network,\nthe efficiency of the system (computation, communication, and storage) stays\nconstant at best. A leading idea for enabling blockchains to scale efficiency\nis the notion of sharding: different subsets of nodes handle different portions\nof the blockchain, thereby reducing the load for each individual node. However,\nexisting sharding proposals achieve efficiency scaling by compromising on trust\n- corrupting the nodes in a given shard will lead to the permanent loss of the\ncorresponding portion of data.

We initiate a thorough investigation\nof spanoids, from computational and structural viewpoints, focusing on\nparameters relevant to the applications areas above and, in particular, to\nquestions regarding Locally Correctable Codes (LCCs).\n  One central parameter we study is the $\\textsf{rank}$ of a spanoid, extending\nthe rank of a matroid and related to the dimension of codes. This leads to one\nmain application of our work, establishing the first known barrier to improving\nthe nearly 20-year old bound of Katz-Trevisan (KT) on the dimension of LCCs. On\nthe one hand, we prove that the KT bound (and its more recent refinements)\nholds for the much more general setting of spanoid rank. On the other hand we\nshow that there exist (random) spanoids whose rank matches these bounds. Thus,\nto significantly improve the known bounds one must step out of the spanoid\nframework.\n  Another parameter we explore is the $\\textsf{functional rank}$ of a spanoid,\nwhich captures the possibility of turning a given spanoid into an actual code.\nThe question of the relationship between rank and functional rank is one of the\nmain questions we raise as it may reveal new avenues for constructing new LCCs\n(perhaps even matching the KT bound). As a first step, we develop an entropy\nrelaxation of functional rank to create a small constant gap and amplify it by\ntensoring to construct a spanoid whose functional rank is smaller than rank by\na polynomial factor. This is evidence that the entropy method we develop can\nprove polynomially better bounds than KT-type methods on the dimension of LCCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 06:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 23:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

Furthermore, a major hope is that knowledge may\ntransfer across tasks, so that multi-task learning can improve generalization\non individual tasks. However we lack analytic theories that can quantitatively\npredict how the degree of knowledge transfer depends on the relationship\nbetween the tasks. We develop an analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of\ngeneralization in deep linear networks, both within and across tasks. In\nparticular, our theory provides analytic solutions to the training and testing\nerror of deep networks as a function of training time, number of examples,\nnetwork size and initialization, and the task structure and SNR. Our theory\nreveals that deep networks progressively learn the most important task\nstructure first, so that generalization error at the early stopping time\nprimarily depends on task structure and is independent of network size. This\nsuggests any tight bound on generalization error must take into account task\nstructure, and explains observations about real data being learned faster than\nrandom data. Intriguingly our theory also reveals the existence of a learning\nalgorithm that proveably out-performs neural network training through gradient\ndescent. Finally, for transfer learning, our theory reveals that knowledge\ntransfer depends sensitively, but computably, on the SNRs and input feature\nalignments of pairs of tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 06:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 22:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

In particular, we discuss a very nice relation\nbetween the electromagnetic perturbations of the gauged Skyrmions and the\nMathieu equation which allows to use many of the modern resurgence techniques\nto determine the behavior of the spectrum of these perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 07:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

This property is of both\nfundamental and practical interest, in particular with a view to exploiting it\nin low-power electronic devices. Advances towards technological applications\nhave been hindered, however, by the relatively low ordering temperatures\n$T_\\mathrm{spiral}$ of most magnetic spiral phases, which rarely exceed 100 K.\nWe have recently established that the ordering temperature of a magnetic spiral\ncan be increased up to 310 K by the introduction of chemical disorder.

In Cu-Fe layered\nperovskites we obtain $T_\\mathrm{spiral}$ values close to 400 K, comfortably\nfar from room temperature and almost 100 K higher than using chemical disorder\nalone. Moreover, we reveal a linear, universal relationship between the\nspiral's wave vector and the onset temperature of the spiral phase. This linear\nlaw ends at a paramagnetic-collinear-spiral triple point, which defines the\nhighest spiral ordering temperature that can be achieved in this class of\nmaterials. Based on these findings, we propose a general set of rules for\ndesigning magnetic spirals in layered perovskites using external pressure,\nchemical substitutions and/or epitaxial strain, which should guide future\nefforts to engineer magnetic spiral phases with ordering temperatures suitable\nfor technological applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 08:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

In this paper, we focus on the extraversion\nmeasure of individual motions in crowds based on trajectory data. Extraversion\nis one of typical personalities that is often observed in human crowd behaviors\nand it can reflect not only the characteristics of the individual motion, but\nalso the that of the holistic crowd motions. To our best knowledge, this is the\nfirst attempt to analyze individual extraversion of crowd motions based on\ntrajectories. To accomplish this, we first present a effective composite motion\ndescriptor, which integrates the basic individual motion information and social\nmetrics, to describe the extraversion of each individual in a crowd. The social\nmetrics consider both the neighboring distribution and their interaction\npattern. Since our major goal is to learn a universal scoring function that can\nmeasure the degrees of extraversion across varied crowd scenes, we incorporate\nand adapt the active learning technique to the relative attribute approach.\nSpecifically, we assume the social groups in any crowds contain individuals\nwith the similar degree of extraversion. Based on such assumption, we\nsignificantly reduce the computation cost by clustering and ranking the\ntrajectories actively. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed\nmethod by measuring the degree of extraversion for real individual trajectories\nin crowds and analyzing crowd scenes from a real-world dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 08:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 02:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

However, in the medical domain, knowledge holds\nunder certain conditions. For example, symptom \\emph{runny nose} highly\nindicates the existence of disease \\emph{whooping cough} when the patient is a\nbaby rather than the people at other ages. Such conditions for medical\nknowledge are crucial for decision-making in various medical applications,\nwhich is missing in existing medical KGs. In this paper, we aim to discovery\nmedical knowledge conditions from texts to enrich KGs.\n  Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are systematized collection of clinical\ndata and contain detailed information about patients, thus EMRs can be a good\nresource to discover medical knowledge conditions. Unfortunately, the amount of\navailable EMRs is limited due to reasons such as regularization. Meanwhile, a\nlarge amount of medical question answering (QA) data is available, which can\ngreatly help the studied task. However, the quality of medical QA data is quite\ndiverse, which may degrade the quality of the discovered medical knowledge\nconditions. In the light of these challenges, we propose a new truth discovery\nmethod, MedTruth, for medical knowledge condition discovery, which incorporates\nprior source quality information into the source reliability estimation\nprocedure, and also utilizes the knowledge triple information for trustworthy\ninformation computation. We conduct series of experiments on real-world medical\ndatasets to demonstrate that the proposed method can discover meaningful and\naccurate conditions for medical knowledge by leveraging both EMR and QA data.\nFurther, the proposed method is tested on synthetic datasets to validate its\neffectiveness under various scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 08:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 03:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Poisson noise commonly occurs in low-light\nand photon- limited settings, where the noise can be most accurately modeled by\nthe Poission distribution. Poisson noise traditionally prevails only in\nspecific fields such as astronomical imaging. However, with the booming market\nof surveillance cameras, which commonly operate in low-light environments, or\nmobile phones, which produce noisy night scene pictures due to lower-grade\nsensors, the necessity for an advanced Poisson image denoising algorithm has\nincreased. Deep learning has achieved amazing breakthroughs in other imaging\nproblems, such image segmentation and recognition, and this paper proposes a\ndeep learning denoising network that outperforms traditional algorithms in\nPoisson denoising especially when the noise is strong.

The denoising network achieved statistically significant\n0.38dB, 0.68dB, and 1.04dB average PSNR gains over benchmark traditional\nalgorithms in experiments with image peak values 4, 2, and 1.

The theory is\nobserver-independent and constructed from discrete histories, making the\nframework a potential setting for discrete quantum cosmology and quantum\ngravity, as well as ordinary discrete quantum systems. The foundation of this\ntheory is Quantum Measure Theory, which generalises (classical) measure theory\nto allow for quantum interference between alternative histories; and its\nco-event interpretation, which describes whether events can or can not occur,\nand in what combination, given a system and a quantum measure. In contrast to\nprevious co-event schemes, the evolving co-event scheme is applied in stages,\nin the stochastic sense, without any dependence on later stages, making it\nmanifestly compatible with an evolving block view. It is shown that the\nco-event realities produced by the basic evolving scheme do not depend on the\ninclusion or exclusion of zero measure histories in the history space, which\nfollows non-trivially from the basic rules of the scheme.

It was recently\nshown that such active terms can cause the bulk phase separation of Model B to\nbe replaced by a steady state of microphase separation at a finite length\nscale. This phenomenon was understood at mean-field level as due to the\nactivity-induced reversal of the Ostwald ripening mechanism, which provides the\nkinetic pathway to bulk phase separation in passive fluids. This reversal\noccurs only in certain ranges for the activity parameters. In this paper we go\nbeyond such a mean-field analysis and develop a $1$-loop Renormalisation Group\n(RG) approach. We first show that, in the parameter range where bulk phase\nseparation is still present, the critical point belongs formally to the same\n(Wilson-Fisher) universality class as the passive Model B. In contrast, in a\nparameter range associated with microphase separation, we find that an unstable\nnon-equilibrium fixed point of the RG flow arises for $d\\geq 2$, colliding with\nthe Wilson-Fisher point in $d\\to 2^+$ and making it unstable in $d=2$. At large\nactivity, the flow in this region is towards strong coupling. We argue that the\nphase transition to microphase separation in active systems, in the physically\nrelevant dimensions $d=2$ and $3$, very probably belongs to a new\nnon-equilibrium universality class. Because it is governed by the\nstrong-coupling regime of the RG flow, our perturbative analysis leaves open\nthe quantitative characterization of this new class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 10:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 10:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

However, the high angular\nresolution is achieved at the expense of reducing the spatial resolution of\neach view by orders of magnitude compared to the raw sensor image. While light\nfield super-resolution is still at an early stage, the field of single image\nsuper-resolution (SISR) has recently known significant advances with the use of\ndeep learning techniques. This paper describes a simple framework allowing us\nto leverage state-of-the-art SISR techniques into light fields, while taking\ninto account specific light field geometrical constraints. The idea is to first\ncompute a representation compacting most of the light field energy into as few\ncomponents as possible. This is achieved by aligning the light field using\noptical flows and then by decomposing the aligned light field using singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD). The principal basis captures the information that is\ncoherent across all the views, while the other basis contain the high angular\nfrequencies. Super-resolving this principal basis using an SISR method allows\nus to super-resolve all the information that is coherent across the entire\nlight field. This framework allows the proposed light field super-resolution\nmethod to inherit the benefits of the SISR method used. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed method is competitive, and most of the time superior, to\nrecent light field super-resolution methods in terms of both PSNR and SSIM\nquality metrics, with a lower complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 10:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

For this problem, all existing regret\nminimization algorithms for the fully-adversarial setting are based on a\npositive semidefinite convex relaxation, and hence require quadratic memory and\nSVD computation (either thin of full) on each iteration, which amounts to at\nleast quadratic runtime per iteration. This is in stark contrast to a\ncorresponding stochastic i.i.d. variant of the problem, which was studied\nextensively lately, and admits very efficient gradient ascent algorithms that\nwork directly on the natural non-convex formulation of the problem, and hence\nrequire only linear memory and linear runtime per iteration.

In dense clouds, hydrogenation reactions on icy dust grains are key\nin the formation of molecules, like formaldehyde, methanol, and complex organic\nmolecules (COMs).

Although molecular hydrogen (H2) abundances can be four orders of\nmagnitude higher than those of free H-atoms in dense clouds, H2 surface\nchemistry has been largely ignored; several laboratory studies show that H2\ndoes not actively participate in non-energetic ice chemistry because of the\nhigh activation energies required.

A central issue related to\nMQCAL methods concerns the development of an integration criteria strategy\n(ICS) that makes full use of all criteria. The conventional ICS adopted in\nrelevant research all facilitate the desired effects, but several limitations\nstill must be addressed. For instance, some of the strategies are not\nsufficiently scalable during the design process, and the number and type of\ncriteria involved are dictated. Thus, it is challenging for the user to\nintegrate other criteria into the original process unless modifications are\nmade to the algorithm. Other strategies are too dependent on empirical\nparameters, which can only be acquired by experience or cross-validation and\nthus lack generality; additionally, these strategies are counter to the\nintention of active learning, as samples need to be labeled in the validation\nset before the active learning process can begin. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel MQCAL method for classification tasks that employs a third\nstrategy via weighted rank aggregation. The proposed method serves as a\nheuristic means to select high-value samples of high scalability and generality\nand is implemented through a three-step process: (1) the transformation of the\nsample selection to sample ranking and scoring, (2) the computation of the\nself-adaptive weights of each criterion, and (3) the weighted aggregation of\neach sample rank list. Ultimately, the sample at the top of the aggregated\nranking list is the most comprehensively valuable and must be labeled. Several\nexperiments generating 257 wins, 194 ties and 49 losses against other\nstate-of-the-art MQCALs are conducted to verify that the proposed method can\nachieve superior results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 15:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

AlphaSeq treats the sequence discovery problem as an episodic\nsymbol-filling game, in which a player fills symbols in the vacant positions of\na sequence set sequentially during an episode of the game. Each episode ends\nwith a completely-filled sequence set, upon which a reward is given based on\nthe desirability of the sequence set. AlphaSeq models the game as a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP), and adapts the DRL framework of AlphaGo to solve the\nMDP.

We propose\nthat the method can be used to detect Terahertz second harmonic generation in\nnoncentrosymmetric media in time-domain spectroscopy, with broad potential\napplications in nonlinear Terahertz photonics and related technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 20:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

In this work, we propose a novel methodology for\ngenerating realistic flow-based network traffic. Our approach is based on\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which achieve good results for image\ngeneration. A major challenge lies in the fact that GANs can only process\ncontinuous attributes. However, flow-based data inevitably contain categorical\nattributes such as IP addresses or port numbers. Therefore, we propose three\ndifferent preprocessing approaches for flow-based data in order to transform\nthem into continuous values. Further, we present a new method for evaluating\nthe generated flow-based network traffic which uses domain knowledge to define\nquality tests. We use the three approaches for generating flow-based network\ntraffic based on the CIDDS-001 data set. Experiments indicate that two of the\nthree approaches are able to generate high quality data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 11:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}
