The bias of an XOR game under local or global strategies\nis shown to be given by a certain injective or projective tensor norm,\nrespectively. The intrinsic (i.e.\\ model-independent) advantage of global over\nlocal strategies is thus connected to a universal function $r(n,m)$ called\n'projective-injective ratio'. This is defined as the minimal constant $\\rho$\nsuch that $\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\pi Y}\\leq\\rho\\,\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\varepsilon\nY}$ holds for all Banach spaces of dimensions $\\dim X=n$ and $\\dim Y=m$, where\n$X\\otimes_\\pi Y$ and $X \\otimes_\\varepsilon Y$ are the projective and injective\ntensor products. By requiring that $X=Y$, one obtains a symmetrised version of\nthe above ratio, denoted by $r_s(n)$. We prove that $r(n,m)\\geq 19/18$ for all\n$n,m\\geq 2$, implying that injective and projective tensor products are never\nisometric.

Magnetization is calculated from the expected value of a\nthermodynamic ensemble of quantized spin waves based on the Heisenberg spin\nmodel applied to an ensemble of coupled harmonic oscillators. A realistic\nenergy landscape is obtained from a magnon dispersion relation calculated using\nspin-density-functional-theory. The equilibrium magnetization as well as the\nevolution of magnetization from a non-equilibrium state to equilibrium are\ncalculated from the path of steepest entropy ascent determined from the SEAQT\nequation of motion in state space. The framework makes it possible to model the\ntemperature- and time-dependence of magnetization without a detailed\ndescription of magnetic damping. The approach is also used to define intensive\nproperties (temperature and magnetic field strength) that are fundamentally,\ni.e., canonically or grand canonically, valid for any non-equilibrium state.\nGiven the assumed magnon dispersion relation, the SEAQT framework is used to\ncalculate the equilibrium magnetization at different temperatures and external\nmagnetic fields and the results are shown to closely agree with experiment for\ntemperatures less than 500 K.

While there has\nbeen significant research on this classical topic, little work has been done\nwhen the set of potential mediators is high-dimensional (HD). A further\ncomplication arises when these mediators are interrelated (with unknown\ndependencies). In particular, we assume that the causal structure of the\ntreatment, the confounders, the potential mediators and the response is a\n(possibly unknown) directed acyclic graph (DAG). HD DAG models have previously\nbeen used for the estimation of causal effects from observational data. In\nparticular, methods called IDA and joint-IDA have been developed for estimating\nthe effects of single and multiple simultaneous interventions, respectively. In\nthis paper, we propose an IDA-type method called MIDA for estimating so-called\nindividual mediation effects from HD observational data. Although IDA and\njoint-IDA estimators have been shown to be consistent in certain sparse HD\nsettings, their asymptotic properties such as convergence in distribution and\ninferential tools in such settings have remained unknown. In this paper, we\nprove HD consistency of MIDA for linear structural equation models with\nsub-Gaussian errors. More importantly, we derive distributional convergence\nresults for MIDA in similar HD settings, which are applicable to IDA and\njoint-IDA estimators as well. To our knowledge, these are the first such\ndistributional convergence results facilitating inference for IDA-type\nestimators. These are built on our novel theoretical results regarding uniform\nbounds for linear regression estimators over varying subsets of HD covariates\nwhich may be of independent interest.

These systems require careful consideration.\n  Aims: To simulate the number of TESS transit detections during its 2 year\nmission with a particular emphasis on single transits. Additionally, to\ndetermine the feasibility of ground-based follow-up observations from a single\nsite.\n  Methods: A distribution of planets is simulated around the $\\sim$ 4 million\nstars in the TESS Candidate Target List. These planets are tested for\ndetectable transits and characterised. Based on simulated parameters the single\ntransit detections are further analysed to determine which are amenable to\nground-based follow-up.\n  Results: TESS will discover an approximate lower bound of 4700 planets with\naround 460 being single transits. A large fraction of these will be observable\nfrom a single ground-based site. This paper finds that, in a single year,\napproximately 1000 transit events of around 320 unique TESS single transit\ndetections are theoretically observable.\n  Conclusions: As we consider longer period exoplanets the need for exploring\nsingle transit detections increases. For periods $\\gtrsim45$ days the number of\nsingle transit detections outnumber multitransits by a factor of 3 (82$\\pm$18\nand 25$\\pm$7 respectively) a factor which only grows as longer period\ndetections are considered. Therefore, it is worth expending the extra effort\nrequired to follow-up these more challenging, but potentially very rewarding,\ndiscoveries. Additionally, we conclude that a large fraction of these targets\ncan be theoretically observed from just a single ground-based site.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

It is assumed that\nthere is no prior information about the data sets at hand. The aim of the\npresent research study is to locate the precise neighborhood using Apollonius\ncircle, which can help us identify the neighborhood state of data points. High\nefficiency of Apollonius structure in assessing local similarities among the\nobservations has opened a new field of the science of geometry in data mining.\nIn order to assess the proposed algorithm, its precision is compared with the\nstate-of-the-art and well-known (k-Nearest Neighbor and epsilon-neighborhood)\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 18:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

The line-of-sight\nvelocities of these PNs are used to identify sub-components, to measure the\nangular momentum content of the smooth M87 halo, and to constrain the orbital\ndistribution of the stars at these large radii. We find that the surface\ndensity profile of the ICPNS at $100\\, \\mathrm{kpc}$ radii has a shallow\nlogarithmic slope, $-\\alpha_{\\rm ICL}\\simeq -0.8$, dominating the light at the\nlargest radii. The angular momentum-related $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{R}}$ profile for\nthe smooth halo remains in the slow rotator regime, out to 135 kpc average\nellipse radius.

The extended LOSVD of the PNs in\nthe M87 halo allows the identification of several subcomponents: the ICPNs, the\n\"crown\" accretion event, and the smooth M87 halo. In galaxies like M87, the\npresence of these sub-components needs to be taken into account to avoid\nsystematic biases in estimating the total enclosed mass. The dynamical\nstructure inferred from the velocity dispersion profile indicates that the\nsmooth halo of M87 steepens beyond $R_{\\rm avg}=60$ kpc and becomes strongly\nradially anisotropic, and that the velocity dispersion profile is consistent\nwith the X-ray circular velocity curve at these radii without non-thermal\npressure effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 18:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

This degeneracy is exacerbated by the expected distribution of\nevents in the universe, which leads us to prefer face-on systems at a greater\ndistance. We use a simplified model that only considers the binary distance and\norientation, and show that this gives comparable results to the full parameter\nestimates obtained from the binary neutron star merger GW170817.

Drawing on constraints from the empirical literature on\ninfant behavior, we present a preliminary computational model of this learning\nprocess, implemented and evaluated on a physical robot. The learning agent\nexplores the relationship between the configuration space of the arm, sensing\njoint angles through proprioception, and its visual perceptions of the hand and\ngrippers. The resulting knowledge is represented as the peripersonal space\n(PPS) graph, where nodes represent states of the arm, edges represent safe\nmovements, and paths represent safe trajectories from one pose to another. In\nour model, the learning process is driven by intrinsic motivation. When\nrepeatedly performing an action, the agent learns the typical result, but also\ndetects unusual outcomes, and is motivated to learn how to make those unusual\nresults reliable. Arm motions typically leave the static background unchanged,\nbut occasionally bump an object, changing its static position. The reach action\nis learned as a reliable way to bump and move an object in the environment.\nSimilarly, once a reliable reach action is learned, it typically makes a\nquasi-static change in the environment, moving an object from one static\nposition to another. The unusual outcome is that the object is accidentally\ngrasped (thanks to the innate Palmar reflex), and thereafter moves dynamically\nwith the hand. Learning to make grasps reliable is more complex than for\nreaches, but we demonstrate significant progress. Our current results are steps\ntoward autonomous sensorimotor learning of motion, reaching, and grasping in\nperipersonal space, based on unguided exploration and intrinsic motivation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 22:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

Many integration techniques have been proposed, although none of\nthese have proven to be fully effective. Integrating feature models becomes a\ndifficult, costly, error-prone task. Since their transition occurs in a\ngeneralized and automated way, the techniques applied to compose the models end\nup giving rise to a final model, in many cases undesired, without taking into\naccount the specific needs arising from the requirements determined by the\nanalysts and developers.

Recently, deep reinforcement learning has shown promise\nat automatically learning controllers for complex systems in simulation. This\nhas been followed by a push towards learning controllers that can be\ntransferred between simulation and hardware, primarily with the use of domain\nrandomization. However, domain randomization can make the problem of finding\nstable controllers even more challenging, especially for underactuated bipedal\nrobots. In this work, we explore whether policies learned in simulation can be\ntransferred to hardware with the use of high-fidelity simulators and structured\ncontrollers. We learn a neural network policy which is a part of a more\nstructured controller.

From individual lensing events, we strongly\nconstrain small scale magnetic structure to $\\sigma_B<10\\,$mG, thus excluding\nscenarios with a strong but rapidly varying field. Finally, from the lack of\nreduction of average circular polarization in the same region, we rule out a\nstrong, quasi-transverse field. We cannot identify any plausible scenario in\nwhich a large magnetic field in this system is concealed, leaving the nature of\nthe interface between the pulsar and companion winds an enigma. Our method can\nbe applied to other sources showing plasma lensing, including other eclipsing\npulsars and fast radio bursts, to study the local properties of the magnetic\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 01:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

We formulate a theoretical\napproach to address all three regimes within a single conceptual Brownian\ndynamics framework.

Using a Hertzian repulsion interparticle potential and a suite of\nstatistical mechanical theories, quantitative predictions under quiescent\nconditions of microgel collective structure, dynamic localization length,\nelastic modulus, and the structural relaxation time are made.

Recently, it has become common to locally\nparametrize these models using rich features extracted by recurrent neural\nnetworks (such as LSTM), while enforcing consistent outputs through a simple\nlinear-chain model, representing Markovian dependencies between successive\nlabels. However, the simple graphical model structure belies the often complex\nnon-local constraints between output labels. For example, many fields, such as\na first name, can only occur a fixed number of times, or in the presence of\nother fields. While RNNs have provided increasingly powerful context-aware\nlocal features for sequence tagging, they have yet to be integrated with a\nglobal graphical model of similar expressivity in the output distribution. Our\nmodel goes beyond the linear chain CRF to incorporate multiple hidden states\nper output label, but parametrizes their transitions parsimoniously with\nlow-rank log-potential scoring matrices, effectively learning an embedding\nspace for hidden states. This augmented latent space of inference variables\ncomplements the rich feature representation of the RNN, and allows exact global\ninference obeying complex, learned non-local output constraints. We experiment\nwith several datasets and show that the model outperforms baseline CRF+RNN\nmodels when global output constraints are necessary at inference-time, and\nexplore the interpretable latent structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 03:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

Climate regimes for slowly rotating planets with the hot-spot near\nthe substellar point, and for rapidly rotating planets with a warm equatorial\nbelt, are both treated. A non-dimensional parameter controlling the fractional\nvariation of the surface pressure is derived; it measures whether the pure\ncondensible atmosphere is global or localized.

Recent advance shows that in the atomic and nano\nscales topological states of dopants play crucial roles in determining their\nproperties. However, such determination is largely unknown due to the\nincredible size of topological states. Here, we present a case study of\ndeveloping deep learning algorithms to predict bandgaps of boron-nitrogen pair\ndoped graphene with arbitrary dopant topologies. A material descriptor system\nthat enables to correlate structures with the bandgaps was developed for\nconvolutional neuron networks (CNNs). Bandgaps calculated by the ab initio\ncalculations and the corresponding structures were fed as input datasets to\ntrain VGG16 convolutional network, residual convolutional network, and\nconcatenate convolutional network.

However, as Titan transitions into northern summer, the\nlack of incoming data from the Cassini orbiter presents a potential barrier to\nthe continued study of seasonal changes in Titan's atmosphere. In our previous\nwork (Thelen et al., 2018), we demonstrated that the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is well suited for measurements of\nTitan's atmosphere in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere (~100-500 km)\nthrough the use of spatially resolved (beam sizes <1'') flux calibration\nobservations of Titan. Here, we derive vertical abundance profiles of four of\nTitan's trace atmospheric species from the same 3 independent spatial regions\nacross Titan's disk during the same epoch (2012 to 2015): HCN, HC$_3$N,\nC$_3$H$_4$, and CH$_3$CN. We find that Titan's minor constituents exhibit large\nlatitudinal variations, with enhanced abundances at high latitudes compared to\nequatorial measurements; this includes CH$_3$CN, which eluded previous\ndetection by Cassini in the stratosphere, and thus spatially resolved abundance\nmeasurements were unattainable. Even over the short 3-year period, vertical\nprofiles and integrated emission maps of these molecules allow us to observe\ntemporal changes in Titan's atmospheric circulation during northern spring. Our\nderived abundance profiles are comparable to contemporary measurements from\nCassini infrared observations, and we find additional evidence for subsidence\nof enriched air onto Titan's south pole during this time period. Continued\nobservations of Titan with ALMA beyond the summer solstice will enable further\nstudy of how Titan's atmospheric composition and dynamics respond to seasonal\nchanges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 06:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

Forecasting over ST data is of\ngreat importance but challenging as it is affected by many complex factors,\nincluding spatial characteristics, temporal characteristics and the intrinsic\ncausality between them. In this paper, we propose a general framework\n(HyperST-Net) based on hypernetworks for deep ST models. More specifically, it\nconsists of three major modules: a spatial module, a temporal module and a\ndeduction module. Among them, the deduction module derives the parameter\nweights of the temporal module from the spatial characteristics, which are\nextracted by the spatial module. Then, we design a general form of HyperST\nlayer as well as different forms for several basic layers in neural networks,\nincluding the dense layer (HyperST-Dense) and the convolutional layer\n(HyperST-Conv).

A drawback for progress in this direction has been the\nlack of studies combining physical properties and accurate structural data\ncovering the full nickelate phase diagram. Here we focus on a small region\nclose to the itinerant limit (R = Pr, 1.5K < T < 300K), where we investigate\nthe gap opening and the simultaneous emergence of charge order in PrNiO3. We\ncombine electric resistance, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements with\nhigh resolution neutron and synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction data that, in\ncontrast to previous studies, we analyze in terms of symmetry-adapted\ndistortion modes. Such analysis allows to identify the contribution of the\ndifferent modes to the global distortion in a broad temperature range.\nMoreover, it shows that the structural changes at the MIT, traditionally\ndescribed in terms of the evolution of the interatomic distances and angles,\nappear as abrupt increases of all nonzero mode amplitudes at TMIT = TN ~130K\naccompanied by the appearance of new modes below this temperature. A further\ninteresting observation is the existence of a nearly perfect linear correlation\nbetween the amplitude of the breathing mode associated to the charge order and\nthe staggered magnetization below the MIT. Our data also uncover a previously\nunnoticed anomaly at T* ~60K (~0.4 x TMIT), clearly visible in the electrical\nresistance, lattice parameters and some mode amplitudes. Since phase\ncoexistence is only observed in a small temperature region around TMIT (~10K),\nthese observations suggest the existence of a hidden symmetry in the insulating\nphase.

The analytic analysis of interference\nproperties shows that spatial interference pattern is determined by the\nrelative velocity of solitons, while temporal interference pattern depends on\nthe velocities and widths of two solitons, differing from the interference\nproperties of scalar bright solitons. Especially, for attractive interactions\nsystem, we show that interference effects can induce some short-time density\nhumps (whose densities are higher than background density) during the collision\nprocess of dark solitons. Moreover, the maximum hump value is remarkably\nsensitive to the variation of the solitons' parameters. For repulsive\ninteractions system, the temporal-spatial interference periods have lower\nlimits. Numerical simulations results suggest that interference patterns for\ndark-bright solitons are more robust against noises than bright-dark solitons.\nThese explicit interference properties can be used to measure the velocities\nand widths of solitons. It is expected that these interference behaviour can be\nobserved experimentally and could be used to design matter wave soliton\ninterferometry in vector systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 09:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 14:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

However, little is known how much parents are aware of the risks\nassociated with the implicit personal data collection by the first- or\nthird-party companies behind the mobile `apps' used by their children, and\nhence how well parents can safeguard their children from this kind of risks.\n  Parents have always been playing a pivotal role in mitigating children's\ninteractions with digital technologies --- from TV to game consoles, to\npersonal computers --- but the rapidly changing technologies are posing\nchallenges for parents to keep up with. There is a pressing need to understand\nhow much parents are aware of privacy risks concerning the use of tablets and\nhow they are managing them for their primary school-aged young children. At the\nsame time, we must also reach out to the children themselves, who are on the\nfrontline of these technologies, to learn how capable they are to recognise\nrisks and how well they are supported by their parents to cope with these\nrisks. Therefore, in the summer of 2017, we conducted face-to-face interviews\nwith 12 families in Oxfordshire and an online survey with 250 parents. This\nreport summarises our key findings of these two studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 10:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

The basic idea is to\nsimplify the complexes of the input sequence by using strong collapses, as\nintroduced by J. Barmak and E. Miniam [DCG (2012)], and to compute the PH of an\ninduced sequence of reduced simplicial complexes that has the same PH as the\ninitial one. Our approach has several salient features that distinguishes it\nfrom previous work. It is not limited to filtrations (i.e. sequences of nested\nsimplicial subcomplexes) but works for other types of sequences like towers and\nzigzags. To strong collapse a simplicial complex, we only need to store the\nmaximal simplices of the complex, not the full set of all its simplices, which\nsaves a lot of space and time. Moreover, the complexes in the sequence can be\nstrong collapsed independently and in parallel. Finally, we can compromize\nbetween precision and time by choosing the number of simplicial complexes of\nthe sequence we strong collapse. As a result and as demonstrated by numerous\nexperiments on publicly available data sets, our approach is extremely fast and\nmemory efficient in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 10:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

Bloom Filter-based Routing approaches like BFR [1], use Bloom Filters\n(BFs) to advertise all provided content objects, which consumes valuable\nbandwidth and storage resources. This strategy is inefficient as clients\nrequest only a small number of the provided content objects and they do not\nneed the content advertisement information for all provided content objects.

Assuming that the Robin coefficient $a$ is large enough, the\nspectrum of the problem in $\\Omega$ is known to be residual and to cover the\nwhole complex plane, but on the contrary, the spectrum in the Lipschitz domain\n$\\Omega^\\varepsilon$ is discrete. However, our results reveal the strange\nbehavior of the discrete spectrum as the blunting parameter $\\varepsilon$ tends\nto 0: we construct asymptotic forms of the eigenvalues and detect families of\n\"hardly movable\" and \"plummeting\" ones. The first type of the eigenvalues do\nnot leave a small neighborhood of a point for any small $\\varepsilon > 0$ while\nthe second ones move at a high rate $O(|\\ln \\varepsilon|)$ downwards along the\nreal axis $\\mathbb{R}$ to $ -\\infty$. At the same time, any point $\\lambda \\in\n\\mathbb{R}$ is a \"blinking eigenvalue\", i.e., it belongs to the spectrum of the\nproblem in $\\Omega^\\varepsilon$ almost periodically in the $|\\ln\n\\varepsilon|$-scale. Besides standard spectral theory, we use the techniques of\ndimension reduction and self-adjoint extensions to obtain these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 11:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

Centrioles, the structural cores of\ncentrosomes and cilia, must duplicate every cell cycle to ensure their faithful\ninheritance through cellular divisions. Work in model organisms identified\nconserved proteins required for centriole duplication and found that altering\ntheir abundance affects centriole number. However, the biophysical principles\nthat ensure that, under physiological conditions, only a single procentriole is\nproduced on each mother centriole remain enigmatic. Here we propose a\nmechanistic biophysical model for the initiation of procentriole formation in\nmammalian cells. The model faithfully recapitulates the experimentally observed\ntransition from PLK4 uniformly distributed around the mother centriole, the\n\"ring\", to a unique PLK4 focus, the \"spot\", that triggers the assembly of a new\nprocentriole. This symmetry breaking requires a dual positive feedback based on\nautocatalytic activation of PLK4 and enhanced centriolar anchoring of PLK4-STIL\ncomplexes by phosphorylated STIL. We find that, contrary to previous proposals,\nin situ degradation of active PLK4 is insufficient to break symmetry. Instead,\nthe model predicts that competition between transient PLK4 activity maxima for\nPLK4-STIL complexes explains both the instability of the PLK4 ring and\nformation of the unique PLK4 spot. In the model, strong competition at\nphysiologically normal parameters robustly produces a single procentriole,\nwhile increasing overexpression of PLK4 and STIL weakens the competition and\ncauses progressive addition of procentrioles in agreement with experimental\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 13:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

This assumption is not fulfilled in Sobolev spaces, which are widely used\nin the theory and numerics of partial differential equations. Our goal is the\nanalysis of the SVD in Sobolev spaces. This work consists of two parts. In this\nmanuscript (part I), we address low-rank approximations and minimal subspaces\nin H1. We analyze the H1-error of the SVD performed in the ambient L2-space. In\npart II, we will address variants of the SVD in norms stronger than the\nL2-norm. We will provide a few numerical examples that support our theoretical\nfindings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 13:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 09:51:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 12:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

Since their inception in the 1940's, a\nwide variety of PC waveforms have been designed using either Frequency\nModulation (FM), phase coding, or frequency hopping to suite particular sonar\napplications. The Sinusoidal FM (SFM) waveform modulates its Instantaneous\nFrequency (IF) by a single frequency sinusoid to achieve high Doppler\nsensitivity which also aids in suppressing reverberation. This allows the SFM\nwaveform to resolve target velocities. While the SFM's resolution in range is\ninversely proportional to its bandwidth, the SFM's Auto-Correlation Function\n(ACF) contains many large sidelobes. The periodicity of the SFM's IF creates\nthese sidelobes and impairs the SFM's ability to clearly distinguish multiple\ntargets in range. This dissertation describes a generalization of the SFM\nwaveform, referred to as the Generalized SFM (GSFM) waveform, that modifies the\nIF to resemble the time/voltage characteristic of a FM chirp waveform. As a\nresult of this modification, the Doppler sensitivity of the SFM is preserved\nwhile substantially reducing the high range sidelobes producing a waveform\nwhose Ambiguity Function (AF) approaches a thumbtack shape. This dissertation\ndescribes the properties of the GSFM's thumbtack AF shape, compares it to other\nwell known waveforms with a similar AF shape, and additionally considers some\nof the practical considerations of active sonar systems including transmitting\nthe GSFM on piezoelectric transducers and the GSFM's ability to suppress\nreverberation. Lastly, this dissertation also describes designing a family of\nin-band nearly orthogonal waveforms with potential applications to Continuous\nActive Sonar (CAS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 13:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

Existing literature has proposed several\ntechniques; however, a quick survey reveals a lack of clarity in the types of\ntechniques proposed, and how many are unique. What is also unclear is whether\nthere is a disparity in the theory and practice of CFO. In this paper, we\nsystematically study CFO techniques proposed for Java programs, both from\npapers and commercially available tools. We evaluate 13 obfuscators using a\ndataset of 16 programs with varying software characteristics, and different\nobfuscator parameters. Each program is carefully reverse engineered to study\nthe effect of obfuscation. Our study reveals that there are 36 unique\ntechniques proposed in the literature and 7 from tools. Three of the most\npopular commercial obfuscators implement only 13 of the 36 techniques in the\nliterature. Thus there appears to be a gap between the theory and practice of\nCFO.

However, this success may derive from idealizations that are made when\nmodeling the word-learning process. In particular, an earlier model assumed\nthat a learner could perfectly recall all previous instances of a word's use\nand the inferences that were drawn about its meaning. In this work, we relax\nthis assumption and determine the performance of a model cross-situational\nlearner who forgets word-meaning associations over time. Our main finding is\nthat it is possible for this learner to acquire a human-scale lexicon by\nadulthood with word-exposure and memory-decay rates that are consistent with\nempirical research on childhood word learning, as long as the degree of\nreferential uncertainty is not too high or the learner employs a mutual\nexclusivity constraint. Our findings therefore suggest that successful word\nlearning does not necessarily demand either highly accurate long-term tracking\nof word and meaning statistics or hypothesis-testing strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 14:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

PET data were acquired with a planar 16x16 cm$^2$ PET system.\nMC simulations of particle interactions and photon propagation in the phantoms\nwere performed using the FLUKA code.

While some are clearly the result of known processes,\nothers still have largely unexplained eccentricity and inclination values.\nIapetus has a still unexplained 3% orbital eccentricity and its orbital plane\nis tilted with respect to its local Laplace plane. On the other hand,\nastrometric measurements of saturnian moons have revealed high tidal migration\nrates, corresponding to a quality factor Q of Saturn of around 1600 for the\nmid-sized icy moons. We show how a past crossing of the 5:1 mean motion\nresonance between Titan and Iapetus may be a plausible scenario to explain\nIapetus' orbit. We have carried out numerical simulations of the resonance\ncrossing using an N-Body code as well as using averaged equations of motion. A\nlarge span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started\non its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can\ntrigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus.\nThe outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate. For a\nquality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic evolution of Iapetus in the\nresonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with a quality\nfactor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with\npost-resonant eccentricities spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations\ncapable of reaching 11 degrees. Usually high inclinations come with high\neccentricities but some simulations show elements compatible with Iapetus'\ncurrent orbit. A quality factor between 100 and 2000 at the frequency of Titan\nwould bring Titan and Iapetus into a 5:1 resonance, which would perturb\nIapetus' eccentricity and inclination to values observed today. Such rapid\ntidal migration would have avoided Iapetus' ejection around 40 to 800 million\nyears ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 14:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

In this paper, first we\npropose a covariance based unified measure of variability for a continuous\nrandom variable X and we show that several measures of variability and\nuncertainty, such as variance, Gini mean difference, cumulative residual\nentropy, etc., can be considered as special cases. Then, we propose a unified\nmeasure of correlation between two continuous random variables X and Y, with\ndistribution functions (DFs) F and G, based on the covariance between X and\nH^{-1}G(Y) (known as the Q-transformation of H on G) where H is a continuous\nDF.

Meanwhile, the famous Kuramoto model has been\nan important mathematical model to study the synchronization phenomena of\ncoupled oscillators over various network topologies. In this paper, we bring\ntogether these two seemingly unrelated objects by investigating the\noptimization landscape of a nonlinear function $E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) =\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n} a_{ij}(1-\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j))$\nassociated to an underlying network and exploring the relationship between the\nexistence of local minima and network topology. This function arises naturally\nin Burer-Monteiro method applied to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization as well as\nmatrix completion on the torus. Moreover, it corresponds to the energy function\nof the homogeneous Kuramoto model on complex networks for coupled oscillators.\nWe prove the minimizer of the energy function is unique up to a global\ntranslation under deterministic dense graphs and Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random\ngraphs with tools from optimization and random matrix theory.

One important goal in graph theoretical analysis of\nbrain networks is to identify network differences across disease types or\nconditions. Typical approaches include massive univariate testing of each edge\nor comparisons of local and/or global network metrics to identify deviations in\ntopological organization. Some limitations of these methods include low\nstatistical power due to the large number of comparisons and difficulty\nattributing overall differences in networks to local variations in brain\nfunction. We propose a novel differential degree test (DDT) to identify brain\nregions incident to a large number of differentially weighted edges across two\npopulations.

We\nachieve this by generating an appropriate set of null networks which are\nmatched on the first and second moments of the observed difference network\nusing the Hirschberger-Qi-Steuer (HQS) algorithm. This formulation permits\nseparation of the network's true topology from the nuisance topology which is\ninduced by the correlation measure and may drive inter-regional connectivity in\nways unrelated to the brain function.

However, the role of\nvery slow axions in previous studies were neglected because of its negligible\ncontribution to the total axion production by this new mechanism. In the\npresent work we specifically focus on analysis of the non-relativistic axions\nwhich will be trapped by the Sun and Earth due to the gravitational forces. The\ncorresponding emission rate of these low energy axions (below the escape\nvelocity) is very tiny. However, these axions will be accumulated by the Sun\nand Earth during their life-times, i.e. 4.5 billion of years, which greatly\nenhances the discovery potential. The computations are based on the so-called\nAxion Quark Nugget (AQN) Dark Matter Model. This model was originally invented\nas a natural explanation of the observed ratio $\\Omega_{\\rm dark} \\sim\n\\Omega_{\\rm visible}$ when the DM and visible matter densities assume the same\norder of magnitude values, irrespectively to the axion mass $m_a$ or initial\nmisalignment angle $\\theta_0$.This model, without adjustment of any parameters,\ngives a very reasonable intensity of the extreme UV (EUV) radiation from the\nsolar corona as a result of the AQN annihilation events with the solar\nmaterial. This extra energy released in corona represents a resolution, within\nAQN framework, a long standing puzzle known in the literature as the \"solar\ncorona heating mystery\". The same annihilation events also produce the axions.\nThe flux of these axions is unambiguously fixed in this model and expressed in\nterms of the EUV luminosity from solar corona.

The smalness of the actual value for $\\Lambda$ can be due\nto the existence of a quantum decoherence scale above the Planck length such\nthat the spacetime evolves as a pure de Sitter universe with a small averaged\ncosmological constant frozen in the lowest energy state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 14:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 19:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

In this paper, based on the assumption that the\nmajority of sources are reliable, a combination rule for a large number of\nsources is proposed using a simple idea: the more common ideas the sources\nshare, the more reliable these sources are supposed to be. This rule is\nadaptable for aggregating a large number of sources which may not all be\nreliable. It will keep the spirit of the conjunctive rule to reinforce the\nbelief on the focal elements with which the sources are in agreement.

To address this problematic we propose a novel\nsolution method that caulks the Leakage in MEEG source activity and\nconnectivity estimates: BC-VARETA. It is based on a joint estimation of source\nactivity and connectivity in the frequency domain representation of MEEG time\nseries. To achieve this, we go beyond current methods that assume a fixed\ngaussian graphical model for source connectivity. In contrast we estimate this\ngraphical model in a Bayesian framework by placing priors on it, which allows\nfor highly optimized computations of the connectivity, via a new procedure\nbased on the local quadratic approximation under quite general prior models. A\nfurther contribution of this paper is the rigorous definition of leakage via\nthe Spatial Dispersion Measure and Earth Movers Distance based on the geodesic\ndistances over the cortical manifold.

We design and\nimplement SONIC, an intermittence-aware software system with specialized\nsupport for DNN inference. SONIC introduces loop continuation, a new technique\nthat dramatically reduces the cost of guaranteeing correct intermittent\nexecution for loop-heavy code like DNN inference. To build a complete system,\nwe further present GENESIS, a tool that automatically compresses networks to\noptimally balance inference accuracy and energy, and TAILS, which exploits SIMD\nhardware available in some microcontrollers to improve energy efficiency. Both\nSONIC & TAILS guarantee correct intermittent execution without any hand-tuning\nor performance loss across different power systems. Across three neural\nnetworks on a commercially available microcontroller, SONIC & TAILS reduce\ninference energy by 6.9x and 12.2x, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 15:24:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 15:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

One of such technologies is\nDevice-to-Device (D2D) communication which exploits user proximity to offer\nspectral efficiency, energy efficiency and increased throughput. Data\noffloading, public safety communication, context aware communication and\ncontent sharing are some of the use cases for D2D communication. D2D\ncommunication can be direct or through a relay depending on the nature of the\nchannel in between the D2D devices. Apart from the problem of interference, a\nkey challenge of relay aided D2D communication is appropriately assigning\nrelays to a D2D pair while maintaining the QoS requirement of the cellular\nusers. In this article, relay assisted D2D communication is reviewed and\nresearch issues are highlighted.

However, these tools are still limited in terms of expressiveness and\naccurately classifying the reviews into more than a positive and a negative\nreview. There is a need to get more insights from user app reviews and direct\nit to future app development. In this paper, we present our result of analyzing\nuser reviews of 20 food journaling and health tracking apps. We gathered and\nanalyzed reviews per app and classified them into three distinct categories\nusing the sentiment treebank with recursive neural tensor network. We then\nanalyzed the vocabulary frequency per category using the Gensim implementation\nof Word2Vec model. The analysis result clustered the reviews into good, bad and\nugly feature reviews. Different usage patterns were detected from users review.\nWe identified major reasons why users express a certain sentiment towards an\napp and learned how users' satisfaction or complaints was related to a specific\nfeature.
