In this context, a particularly important\ndemonstration has been that non-vanishing discord is the necessary condition\nfor the separable states to be used as resource for remotely preparing any\narbitrary pure target state [Nature Physics $8$, $666$ $(2012)$]. The present\nwork stems from our observation that not only resource states with same discord\ncan imply different efficiencies (in terms of average fidelity) of the remote\nstate preparation (RSP) protocol, but also states with higher discord can imply\nlower RSP efficiency. This, therefore, necessitates identification of the\nrelevant feature of quantum correlations which can appropriately quantify\neffectiveness of the resource state for the RSP protocol. To this end, for the\ntwo-qubit Bell-diagonal states, we show that an appropriate measure of\nsimultaneous correlations in three mutually unbiased bases can serve to\nquantify usefulness of the resource for the RSP task using entangled as well as\nseparable states, including non-discordant states as resource. In particular,\nit is revealed that zero-discord states having such non-vanishing measure can\nbe useful for remotely preparing a subset of pure target states.

The\nfeatures in deep CNN contain different types of information which make\ndifferent contributions to image reconstruction. However, most CNN-based models\nlack discriminative ability for different types of information and deal with\nthem equally, which results in the representational capacity of the models\nbeing limited. On the other hand, as the depth of neural networks grows, the\nlong-term information coming from preceding layers is easy to be weaken or lost\nin late layers, which is adverse to super-resolving image. To capture more\ninformative features and maintain long-term information for image\nsuper-resolution, we propose a channel-wise and spatial feature modulation\n(CSFM) network in which a sequence of feature-modulation memory (FMM) modules\nis cascaded with a densely connected structure to transform low-resolution\nfeatures to high informative features. In each FMM module, we construct a set\nof channel-wise and spatial attention residual (CSAR) blocks and stack them in\na chain structure to dynamically modulate multi-level features in a\nglobal-and-local manner. This feature modulation strategy enables the high\ncontribution information to be enhanced and the redundant information to be\nsuppressed. Meanwhile, for long-term information persistence, a gated fusion\n(GF) node is attached at the end of the FMM module to adaptively fuse\nhierarchical features and distill more effective information via the dense skip\nconnections and the gating mechanism. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations on benchmark datasets illustrate the superiority of our proposed\nmethod over the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 16:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-01"}

Given the broad\nappearance of topology in such systems, it is expected that correlated\nelectronic systems should also be capable of hosting topologically non-trivial\nstates. Interest in correlated platforms is heightened by the prospect that\ncollective behavior therein may give rise to new types of topological states\nand phenomena not possible in non-interacting systems. However, to date only a\nlimited number of correlated topological materials have been definitively\nreported due to both the challenge in calculation of their electronic\nproperties and the experimental complexity of correlation effects imposed on\nthe topological aspects of their electronic structure. Here, we report a de\nHaas-van Alphen (dHvA) study of the recently discovered kagome metal\nFe$_3$Sn$_2$ mapping the massive Dirac states strongly coupled to the intrinsic\nferromagnetic order.

This galaxy has a soft X-ray excess\nthat is typical for the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1. The question of the\norigin of soft excess in such objects is still unclear. We tested and compared\ntwo spectral models for the soft X-ray spectra based on the different physical\nscenarios. The first one is based on the Done & Nayakshin model of two-phase\naccretion disc in a vertical direction, which includes two reflection zones\nwith different ionization levels. According to this model, we found that a\nhighly ionized reflection has the value of ionization $\\xi\\sim3000$\n$erg~s^{-1}~cm$ and is mostly responsible for the soft excess. This reflection\nbecomes comparable with a low ionized one ($\\xi\\sim30$ $erg~s^{-1}~cm$) in\nmoderate X-ray range.

This vehicle has several advantages over other aircraft including the\nability to take-off and land in very short distances and without the need for\nroads or runways. Despite these advantages, the large surface area of the\nvehicle's wing makes it more susceptible to wind, which introduces undesirable\nroll angle motions. The role of the automatic crosswind stabilization system is\nto detect the roll angle deviation, and then use motors at the wingtips to\ncounteract the wind effect. However, due to the relatively large inertia of the\nwing compared to small-size unmanned aerial vehicles and additional input time\ndelays, an automatic crosswind stabilization system based on traditional\ncontrol algorithms such as the proportional-integral-derivative (PID)\ncontroller results in a response time that is too slow. Another challenge is\nthe lack of high-accuracy wind sensors that can be mounted on the vehicle's\nwing. Therefore, we first design a wind torque estimator that relies on\ninertial measurements, and then use feed-forward compensation to directly\ncorrect for the wind torque, resulting in a significantly faster response. We\nsecond combine the proposed estimator with a model predictive controller (MPC),\nand compare constrained MPC with unconstrained MPC for the considered\napplication.

Long-readout scans, with\ngreater off-resonance artifacts but shorter scan time, were corrected by\nautofocus and Off-ResNet and compared to short-readout scans by normalized\nroot-mean-square error (NRMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Scans were also compared by scoring on eight\nanatomical features by two radiologists, using analysis of variance with\npost-hoc Tukey's test. Reader agreement was determined with intraclass\ncorrelation. Results: Long-readout scans were on average 59.3% shorter than\nshort-readout scans. Images from Off-ResNet had superior NRMSE, SSIM, and PSNR\ncompared to uncorrected images across +-1kHz off-resonance (P<0.01). The\nproposed method had superior NRMSE over -677Hz to +1kHz and superior SSIM and\nPSNR over +-1kHz compared to autofocus (P<0.01). Radiologic scoring\ndemonstrated that long-readout scans corrected with Off-ResNet were\nnon-inferior to short-readout scans (P<0.01). Conclusion: The proposed method\ncan correct off-resonance artifacts from rapid long-readout 3D cones scans to a\nnon-inferior image quality compared to diagnostically standard short-readout\nscans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 20:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

To tackle these\nsecurity challenges, cyber-infrastructures require active defense techniques\nthat incorporate cyber deception, in which the defender (deceiver) implements a\nstrategy to mislead the infiltrator. To this end, we use a two-player partially\nobservable stochastic game (POSG) framework, wherein the deceiver has full\nobservability over the states of the POSG, and the infiltrator has partial\nobservability. Then, the deception problem is to compute a strategy for the\ndeceiver that minimizes the expected cost of deception against all strategies\nof the infiltrator. We first show that the underlying problem is a robust\nmixed-integer linear program, which is intractable to solve in general. Towards\na scalable approach, we compute optimal finite-memory strategies for the\ninfiltrator by a reduction to a series of synthesis problems for parametric\nMarkov decision processes.

Typical shapes of interest are measured using 3D imaging\nand a subsequent pipeline of registration, segmentation, and some extraction of\nshape features or projections onto some lower-dimensional shape space, which\nfacilitates subsequent statistical analysis. Many methods for constructing\ncompact shape representations have been proposed, but are often impractical due\nto the sequence of image preprocessing operations, which involve significant\nparameter tuning, manual delineation, and/or quality control by the users. We\npropose DeepSSM: a deep learning approach to extract a low-dimensional shape\nrepresentation directly from 3D images, requiring virtually no parameter tuning\nor user assistance. DeepSSM uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that\nsimultaneously localizes the biological structure of interest, establishes\ncorrespondences, and projects these points onto a low-dimensional shape\nrepresentation in the form of PCA loadings within a point distribution model.\nTo overcome the challenge of the limited availability of training images, we\npresent a novel data augmentation procedure that uses existing correspondences\non a relatively small set of processed images with shape statistics to create\nplausible training samples with known shape parameters. Hence, we leverage the\nlimited CT/MRI scans (40-50) into thousands of images needed to train a CNN.\nAfter the training, the CNN automatically produces accurate low-dimensional\nshape representations for unseen images.

This leads to the crucial question of how\ngeneralization gap should be predicted from the training data and network\nparameters. In this paper, we propose such a measure, and conduct extensive\nempirical studies on how well it can predict the generalization gap. Our\nmeasure is based on the concept of margin distribution, which are the distances\nof training points to the decision boundary. We find that it is necessary to\nuse margin distributions at multiple layers of a deep network. On the CIFAR-10\nand the CIFAR-100 datasets, our proposed measure correlates very strongly with\nthe generalization gap. In addition, we find the following other factors to be\nof importance: normalizing margin values for scale independence, using\ncharacterizations of margin distribution rather than just the margin (closest\ndistance to decision boundary), and working in log space instead of linear\nspace (effectively using a product of margins rather than a sum). Our measure\ncan be easily applied to feedforward deep networks with any architecture and\nmay point towards new training loss functions that could enable better\ngeneralization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 23:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 07:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}

We\nexplore the hypothesis that high density contrast leads to near-surface shear\nby creating a rotationally unconstrained layer of fast flows near the outer\nsurface. Although our high-contrast models do have near-surface shear, it is\nconfined primarily to low latitudes (between $\\pm15^\\circ$). Two distinct types\nof flow structures maintain the shear dynamically: rotationally\n$\\textit{constrained}$ Busse columns aligned with the rotation axis and fast,\nrotationally $\\textit{unconstrained}$ downflow plumes that deplete angular\nmomentum from the outer fluid layers. The plumes form at all latitudes, and in\nfact are more efficient at transporting angular momentum inward at high\nlatitudes. The presence of Busse columns at low latitudes thus appears\nessential to creating near-surface shear in our models. We conclude that a\nsolar-like NSSL is unobtainable from a rotationally unconstrained outer fluid\nlayer alone.

However, no systematic\nanalysis has been conducted on attribute construction which heavily impacts the\nperformance of supervised algorithms for bug report summarization. In this\nstudy, we first conduct a survey to reveal the existing methods for attribute\nconstruction in mining software repositories. Then, we propose a new method\nnamed Crowd-Attribute to infer new effective attributes from the crowdgenerated\ndata in crowdsourcing and develop a new tool named Crowdsourcing Software\nEngineering Platform to facilitate this method. With Crowd-Attribute, we\nsuccessfully construct 11 new attributes and propose a new supervised algorithm\nnamed Logistic Regression with Crowdsourced Attributes (LRCA). To evaluate the\neffectiveness of LRCA, we build a series of large scale data sets with 105,177\nbug reports. Experiments over both the public data set SDS with 36 manually\nannotated bug reports and new large-scale data sets demonstrate that LRCA can\nconsistently outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms for bug report\nsummarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 01:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

By\neither implicitly or explicitly mapping the environment, ego-motion can be\ndetermined and a path of actions can be planned. The process of mapping and\nnavigation are delicately intertwined; therefore, improving one can often lead\nto an improvement of the other. Both processes are sensitive to the interior\norientation parameters of the camera system and mathematically modelling these\nsystematic errors can often improve the precision and accuracy of the overall\nsolution. This paper presents an automatic camera calibration method suitable\nfor any lens, without having prior knowledge about the sensor. Statistical\ninference is performed to map the environment and localize the camera\nsimultaneously. K-nearest neighbour regression is used to model the geometric\ndistortions of the images. A normal-angle lens Nikon camera and wide-angle lens\nGoPro camera were calibrated using the proposed method, as well as the\nconventional bundle adjustment with self-calibration method (for comparison).\nResults showed that the mapping error was reduced from an average of 14.9 mm to\n1.2 mm (i.e. a 92% improvement) and 66.6 mm to 1.5 mm (i.e. a 98% improvement)\nusing the proposed method for the Nikon and GoPro cameras, respectively.

Researchers recently propose several algorithms to avoid the issue of\nnon-convergence of Adam, but their efficiency turns out to be unsatisfactory in\npractice. In this paper, we provide new insight into the non-convergence issue\nof Adam as well as other adaptive learning rate methods. We argue that there\nexists an inappropriate correlation between gradient $g_t$ and the\nsecond-moment term $v_t$ in Adam ($t$ is the timestep), which results in that a\nlarge gradient is likely to have small step size while a small gradient may\nhave a large step size. We demonstrate that such biased step sizes are the\nfundamental cause of non-convergence of Adam, and we further prove that\ndecorrelating $v_t$ and $g_t$ will lead to unbiased step size for each\ngradient, thus solving the non-convergence problem of Adam. Finally, we propose\nAdaShift, a novel adaptive learning rate method that decorrelates $v_t$ and\n$g_t$ by temporal shifting, i.e., using temporally shifted gradient $g_{t-n}$\nto calculate $v_t$. The experiment results demonstrate that AdaShift is able to\naddress the non-convergence issue of Adam, while still maintaining a\ncompetitive performance with Adam in terms of both training speed and\ngeneralization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 03:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 09:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 13:00:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 07:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

The 90\\%\nc.l. limits which we obtained on the graviton mass using SPT, Planck and SDSS\nare: $m_g < 4.73 \\times 10^{-30}$ eV, $3.0 \\times 10^{-30}$ eV, and $1.27\n\\times 10^{-30}$ eV respectively; or in terms of Compton wavelength are\n$\\lambda_g >2.62 \\times 10^{20}$ km, $4.12 \\times 10^{20}$ km, $9.76 \\times\n10^{20}$ km. These limits are about five times more stringent than the previous\nbest bound from galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 12:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Instead of the traditional surface flashover of creepage on the\ninsulator surface between the electrodes, a surface discharge with one of the\nelectrodes being placed far away from the insulator is achieved in this paper.\nThe unique electric field distribution due to the multi-anode electrode\ngeometry has a significant influence on the discharge process of the surface\ndischarge. It changes the generation and propagation process of the plasma,\nforming a plasma plume contributes to the propulsion performance of the\nthruster. Through theoretical analysis of the obtained plume data, it is\nindicated that the ablative pulsed plasma thruster based on multi-anode\nelectrode geometry (short for multi-anode APPT) promotes the internal pressure\nof the plasma jet during its propagation and significantly increases the\ndensity and energy of charged particles. The discharge phenomena manifest that\nthe multi-anode APPT and the helix-coil multi-anode APPT effectively increase\nthe intensity of the plasma plume. Through electron density spatial\ndistribution measurement, it has been found that the helix-coil multi-anode\nAPPT increases the density of plasma in the axial direction to more than 4\ntimes of the conventional coaxial APPT and reduces the electron density in\nother directions. In the propulsion test, it has been demonstrated that the\nmulti-anode APPT and the helix-coil multi-anode APPT have better performance in\nterms of the impulse bit and the thrust-to-power ratio.

We discover that a many-body electronic state from the\nkagome lattice couples strongly to the vector field with three-dimensional\nanisotropy, exhibiting a magnetization-driven giant nematic\n(two-fold-symmetric) energy shift. Probing the fermionic quasi-particle\ninterference reveals consistent spontaneous nematicity-a clear indication of\nelectron correlation-and vector magnetization is capable of altering this\nstate, thus controlling the many-body electronic symmetry. These spin-driven\ngiant electronic responses go well beyond Zeeman physics and point to the\nrealization of an underlying correlated magnetic topological phase. The\ntunability of this kagome magnet reveals a strong interplay between an\nexternally applied field, electronic excitations and nematicity, providing new\nways of controlling spin-orbit properties and exploring emergent phenomena in\ntopological or quantum materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 14:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

Furthermore, most\ntranslation models only enable one-to-one or one-to-many transfer by relying on\nseparate encoders or decoders and complex, computationally-heavy models. In\nthis paper, we introduce the Modulated Variational auto-Encoders (MoVE) to\nperform musical timbre transfer. We define timbre transfer as applying parts of\nthe auditory properties of a musical instrument onto another. First, we show\nthat we can achieve this task by conditioning existing domain translation\ntechniques with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Then, we alleviate the\nneed for additional adversarial networks by replacing the usual translation\ncriterion by a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) objective. This allows a faster\nand more stable training along with a controllable latent space encoder. By\nfurther conditioning our system on several different instruments, we can\ngeneralize to many-to-many transfer within a single variational architecture\nable to perform multi-domain transfers. Our models map inputs to 3-dimensional\nrepresentations, successfully translating timbre from one instrument to another\nand supporting sound synthesis from a reduced set of control parameters.

While these methods work reasonably\nwell for particular types of sound sources, one limitation is that they can\nfail to work for sources with spectrograms that do not comply with the NMF\nmodel. To address this limitation, an extension of ILRMA called the\nMultichannel Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) method was recently proposed, where\na Conditional VAE (CVAE) is used instead of the NMF model for source power\nspectrogram modeling.

Static wrinkle patterns are known to be governed by an\nenergetic balance between the object's bending stiffness and an effective\nsubstrate stiffness, which may originate from a true substrate stiffness or\nfrom tension and curvature along the wrinkles. Here we investigate dynamic\nwrinkling, induced by the impact of a solid sphere onto an ultra-thin polymer\nsheet floating on water. The vertical deflection of the sheet's centre induced\nby impact draws material radially inwards, resulting in an azimuthal\ncompression that is relieved by the wrinkling of the entire sheet. We show that\nthis wrinkling is truly dynamic, exhibiting features that are qualitatively\ndifferent to those seen in quasi-static wrinkling experiments. Moreover, we\nshow that the wrinkles coarsen dynamically because of the inhibiting effect of\nthe fluid inertia. This dynamic coarsening can be understood heuristically as\nthe result of a dynamic stiffness, which dominates the static stiffnesses\nreported thus far, and allows new controls of wrinkle wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 16:56:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 14:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 17:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 16:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

In this paper it is argued that one\ncan investigate some properties of the Riemann zeta function in the region\n${\\rm Re}\\,s<1$ by allowing operator-valued zeta functions to act on test\nfunctions.

However it has become clear there is\nno best active learning algorithm. Inspired by various philosophies about what\nconstitutes a good criteria, different algorithms perform well on different\ndatasets. This has motivated research into ensembles of active learners that\nlearn what constitutes a good criteria in a given scenario, typically via\nmulti-armed bandit algorithms. Though algorithm ensembles can lead to better\nresults, they overlook the fact that not only does algorithm efficacy vary\nacross datasets, but also during a single active learning session. That is, the\nbest criteria is non-stationary. This breaks existing algorithms' guarantees\nand hampers their performance in practice. In this paper, we propose dynamic\nensemble active learning as a more general and promising research direction. We\ndevelop a dynamic ensemble active learner based on a non-stationary multi-armed\nbandit with expert advice algorithm. Our dynamic ensemble selects the right\ncriteria at each step of active learning.
