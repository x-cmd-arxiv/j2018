It\ndiffers from supervised learning, since reinforcement learning requires no\nexplicit labels; instead, the agent interacts continuously with its\nenvironment. That is, the agent starts in a specific state and then performs an\naction, based on which it transitions to a new state and, depending on the\noutcome, receives a reward. Different strategies (e.g. Q-learning) have been\nproposed to maximize the overall reward, resulting in a so-called policy, which\ndefines the best possible action in each state. Mathematically, this process\ncan be formalized by a Markov decision process and it has been implemented by\npackages in R; however, there is currently no package available for\nreinforcement learning. As a remedy, this paper demonstrates how to perform\nreinforcement learning in R and, for this purpose, introduces the\nReinforcementLearning package.

From the\ninvestigation of correlations of effective radius, Sersic index, absolute\nmagnitude and bulge to total light ratio, we find the galaxies are distributed\nas follows: dwarfs 18\\%, E/SO 33\\%, SO 22\\%, Sb \\& Sb0 17\\% and 10\\% are\nSpirals+Irregulars+Ring. We found that multiple component fits are best for\ngiants and the single Sersic fit is best for dwarfs \\& spiral galaxies. We\nshall try to explain why the single Sersic fit is best for dwarfs and what kind\nof stellar orbits do they correspond to using the bulge Sersic index of dwarfs .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 17:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

It is based on methodology that was introduced by Bijani et al\n(2015), in which a homogeneous subsurface body is modeled by an ensemble of\nsimple point masses. The model parameters are the Cartesian coordinates of the\npoint masses and their total mass. Associating the point masses to the vertices\nof a weighted full graph with weights computed by the Euclidean pairwise\ndistances separating vertices, Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the minimum\nspanning tree of the graph. Stabilization is achieved using an equidistance\nfunction that restricts the spatial distribution of the masses and favors a\nhomogeneous subsurface structure. A regularization parameter $\\lambda$ is\nintroduced to balance the two terms of the objective function, and reasonable\nphysically-relevant bound constraints are imposed on the model parameters. Then\nthe bound constrained objective function is solved using a genetic algorithm. A\nnew diagnostic approach is presented for determining a suitable choice for\n$\\lambda$, requiring a limited number of solutions for a small set of $\\lambda$\nwithout using the L-curve as suggested by Bijani et al.

The cell\npossesses a unique motor protein, prestin, which senses voltage and\nconsequently changes conformation to cause large cell length changes, termed\nelectromotility (eM). In OHCs studied in vitro, the prestin voltage sensor\ngenerates a capacitance that is both voltage and frequency dependent, peaking\nin magnitude at a characteristic membrane voltage (Vh), which can be greater\nthan the linear capacitance of the cell. Consequently, the OHC membrane time\nconstant is multifarious depending upon resting potential and frequency of AC\nevaluation. After precisely correcting for this influence on the whole-cell\nvoltage clamp time constant, we find that OHC eM is low pass in nature,\nsubstantially attenuating in magnitude within the frequency bandwidth of human\nspeech. The frequency response is slowest at Vh, with a cut-off near 1.5 kHz,\nbut increases up to six-fold in a U shaped manner as holding voltage deviates\nfrom Vh. NLC measures follow this pattern. Viscous drag alone cannot account\nfor such eM behavior; nor can it arise from viscous drag in combination with a\nsigmoidal voltage-dependent OHC stiffness. However, viscous drag combined with\nkinetics of prestin, likely corresponding to its bell-shaped conformational\ngating compliance (Iwasa, 2000), is in line with our observations. How OHC eM\ninfluences cochlear amplification at higher frequencies needs reconsideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2018 22:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

In this paper, we present results for an\neffective relativistic band structure of (CH3NH3)PbI3 with the focus on the\ndispersion of electronic states near the band edges of (CH3NH3)PbI3 affected by\nthermal structural fluctuations. We establish a relation between the magnitude\nof Rashba splitting and a deviation of Pb-atom from its centrosymmetric site\nposition in the PbI6 octahedron. For the splitting energy to reach the thermal\nenergy kT~26 meV (room temperature), the displacement should be of the order\n0.3 Ang, which is far above the static displacements of Pb-atoms in the\ntetragonal phase of (CH3NH3)PbI3. The significant dynamic enhancement of the\nRashba splitting observed at earlier simulation times (less than 2 ps) later\nweakens and becomes less than the thermal energy despite the average\ndisplacement of Pb-atoms remaining large (0.37 Ang). It is randomization of\nPb-displacement vectors and associated cancelation of the net effective\nmagnetic field acting on electrons at the conduction band edge is responsible\nfor reduction of the Rashba splitting. The lattice dynamics also leads to\ndeterioration of Bloch character for states in the valence band leading to\nsubsequent localization of holes, which affects bipolar mobility of charge\ncarriers in (CH3NH3)PbI3.

L-BFGS can be used with or without \"scaling\"; the use of\nscaling is normally recommended. A simple special case, when just one BFGS\nupdate is stored and used at every iteration, is sometimes also known as\nmemoryless BFGS. We analyze memoryless BFGS with scaling, using any\nArmijo-Wolfe line search, on the function $f(x) = a|x^{(1)}| + \\sum_{i=2}^{n}\nx^{(i)}$, initiated at any point $x_0$ with $x_0^{(1)}\\not = 0$.

As we showed in previous work, the gradient\nmethod with any Armijo-Wolfe line search also fails on the same function if\n$a\\geq \\sqrt{n-1}$ and $a$ is larger than another quantity depending on the\nArmijo parameter, but scaled memoryless BFGS fails under a weaker condition\nrelating $a$ to the Armijo parameter than that implying failure of the gradient\nmethod. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to the gradient method, if a specific\nstandard Armijo-Wolfe bracketing line search is used, scaled memoryless BFGS\nfails when $a\\ge 2 \\sqrt{n-1} $ regardless of the Armijo parameter.

For the asymptotic\nregime, we use the asymptotic characterization of the Gaussian NRDF to provide\na new equivalent realization scheme with feedback which is characterized by a\nresource allocation (reverse-waterfilling) problem across the dimension of the\nvector source. We leverage the new realization to derive a predictive coding\nscheme via lattice quantization with subtractive dither and joint memoryless\nentropy coding. This coding scheme offers an upper bound to the operational\nzero-delay vector-valued Gaussian RDF. When we use scalar quantization, then\nfor \"r\" active dimensions of the vector Gauss-Markov source the gap between the\nobtained lower and theoretical upper bounds is less than or equal to 0.254r + 1\nbits/vector. We further show that it is possible when we use vector\nquantization, and assume infinite dimensional Gauss-Markov sources to make the\nprevious gap to be negligible, i.e., Gaussian NRDF approximates the operational\nzero-delay Gaussian RDF. We also extend our results to vector-valued Gaussian\nsources of any finite memory under mild conditions.

These predictions motivated us to\nperform a sophisticated time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the GW signals, aimed\nat preparation for future observations. By reanalyzing a gravitational waveform\nobtained in a three-dimensional general-relativistic CCSN simulation, we show\nthat both the spectrogram with an adequate window and the quadratic TFA\nseparate the multimodal GW signatures much more clearly compared with the\nprevious analysis. We find that the observed low-frequency excess during the\nSASI active phase is divided into two components, a stronger one at 130 Hz and\nan overtone at 260 Hz, both of which evolve quasi-statically during the\nsimulation time.

This is because the performance of different services often\ndepends on conflicting requirements, including bandwidth, sensitivity to delay,\nor the monetary value of the traffic incurred. In this paper, we put forward a\ngeneral rate utility framework for slicing mm-wave backhaul links, encompassing\nall known types of service utilities, i.e. logarithmic, sigmoid, polynomial,\nand linear. We then introduce DELMU, a deep learning solution that tackles the\ncomplexity of optimising non-convex objective functions built upon arbitrary\ncombinations of such utilities. Specifically, by employing a stack of\nconvolutional blocks, DELMU can learn correlations between traffic demands and\nachievable optimal rate assignments. We further regulate the inferences made by\nthe neural network through a simple 'sanity check' routine, which guarantees\nboth flow rate admissibility within the network's capacity region and minimum\nservice levels. The proposed method can be trained within minutes, following\nwhich it computes rate allocations that match those obtained with\nstate-of-the-art global optimisation algorithms, yet orders of magnitude\nfaster.

Recently, Duchi et al. proposed private sampling\nstrategy to solve privacy leakage in stochastic optimizations.

To address this challenge, we introduce a robust stochastic\noptimization under the framework of local privacy, which is called\nPrivacy-pREserving StochasTIc Gradual lEarning (PRESTIGE). PRESTIGE bridges\nprivate updates of the primal variable (by private sampling) with the gradual\ncurriculum learning (CL). Specifically, the noise injection leads to the issue\nof label noise, but the robust learning process of CL can combat with label\nnoise. Thus, PRESTIGE yields \"private but robust\" updates of the primal\nvariable on the private curriculum, namely an reordered label sequence provided\nby CL. In theory, we reveal the convergence rate and maximum complexity of\nPRESTIGE. Empirical results on six datasets show that, PRESTIGE achieves a good\ntradeoff between privacy preservation and robustness over baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 14:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

It is\nfound that when fluctuation of physical noise channel is considered, the\naverage effective channel is dependent only on the average of physical noise\nchannel, and the average of physical noise channel here plays the role of the\nindependent error model in the previous works. Now, one may conclude that in\nthe independent error model, the results in previous works are also valid for\naverage channel where fluctuation exists. In some typical cases, our numerical\nsimulations in the concatenated QEC protocol with 5-qubit code, 7-qubit Steane\ncode and 9-qubit Shor confirm this conjecture. For 5-qubit code, the effective\nchannels are approximate to depolarizing channel as the concatenated level\nincreases. For Steane code, the effective channels are approximate to one Pauli\nchannel as the concatenated level increases. For Shor code, the effective\nchannels are approximate to one of Pauli-$X$ and Pauli-$Z$ channels in each\nlevel, and in next concatenated level, the effective channels are approximate\nto the other.

Holograms contain noise due to the stochastic nature of solar\noscillations. We provide a theoretical framework for modeling signal and noise\nin Porter-Bojarski helioseismic holography. The wave equation may be recast\ninto a Helmholtz-like equation, so as to connect with the acoustics literature\nand define the holography Green's function in a meaningful way. Sources of wave\nexcitation are assumed to be stationary, horizontally homogeneous, and\nspatially uncorrelated. Using the first Born approximation we calculate\nholograms in the presence of perturbations in sound-speed, density, flows, and\nsource covariance, as well as the noise level as a function of position. This\nwork is a direct extension of the methods used in time-distance helioseismology\nto model signal and noise. To illustrate the theory, we compute the hologram\nintensity numerically for a buried sound-speed perturbation at different depths\nin the solar interior. The reference Green's function is obtained for a\nspherically-symmetric solar model using a finite-element solver in the\nfrequency domain. Below the pupil area on the surface, we find that the spatial\nresolution of the hologram intensity is very close to half the local\nwavelength. For a sound-speed perturbation of size comparable to the local\nspatial resolution, the signal-to-noise ratio is approximately constant with\ndepth. Averaging the hologram intensity over a number $N$ of frequencies above\n3 mHz increases the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor nearly equal to the\nsquare root of $N$. This may not be the case at lower frequencies, where large\nvariations in the holographic signal are due to the individual contributions of\nthe long-lived modes of oscillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 15:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The proposed RCCNet model consists of only\n1,512,868 learnable parameters which are significantly less compared to the\npopular CNN models such as AlexNet, CIFARVGG, GoogLeNet, and WRN. The\nexperiments are conducted over publicly available routine colon cancer\nhistological dataset \"CRCHistoPhenotypes\". The results of the proposed RCCNet\nmodel are compared with five state-of-the-art CNN models in terms of the\naccuracy, weighted average F1 score and training time. The proposed method has\nachieved a classification accuracy of 80.61% and 0.7887 weighted average F1\nscore. The proposed RCCNet is more efficient and generalized terms of the\ntraining time and data over-fitting, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 07:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 12:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 05:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

For analysis cardiac functionality, extracting information from the\nLeft ventricular (LV) is already a broad field of Medical Imaging. Different\nalgorithms and strategies ranging that is semiautomated or automated has\nalready been developed to get useful information from such a critical structure\nof heart. Trabeculae in the heart undergoes difference changes like solid from\nspongy. Due to failure of this process left ventricle non-compaction occurred.\nIn this project, we will demonstrate the fractal dimension (FD) and manual\nsegmentation of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the heart that quantify\namount of trabeculae inside the heart. The greater the value of fractal\ndimension inside the heart indicates the greater complex pattern of the\ntrabeculae in the heart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 15:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 17:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}
