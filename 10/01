Moreover, these\nforms can be chosen so that the ideal generated by any subset defines a ring\nsatisfying the Serre condition R$_\\eta$. A critical element in the proof is to\nshow that there are functions ${}^\\eta\\!A(n,d)$ with the following property: in\na graded $n$-dimensional $K$-vector subspace $V$ of $R$ spanned by forms of\ndegree at most $d$, if no nonzero form in $V$ is in an ideal generated by\n${}^\\eta\\!A(n,d)$ forms of strictly lower degree (we call this a {\\it strength}\ncondition), then any homogeneous basis for $V$ is an R$_\\eta$ sequence. The\nmethods of \\cite{AH2} are not constructive. In this paper, we use related but\ndifferent ideas that emphasize the notion of a {\\it key function} to obtain the\nfunctions ${}^\\eta\\!A(n,d)$ in degrees 2, 3, and 4 (in degree 4 we must\nrestrict to characteristic not 2, 3). We give bounds in closed form for the key\nfunctions and the ${}^\\eta\\!A$ functions, and explicit recursions that\ndetermine the functions ${}^\\eta\\!B$ from the ${}^\\eta\\!A$ functions. In degree\n2, we obtain an explicit value for ${}^\\eta\\!B(n,2)$ that gives the best known\nbound in Stillman's conjecture for quadrics when there is no restriction on\n$n$. In particular, for an ideal $I$ generated by $n$ quadrics, the projective\ndimension $R/I$ is at most $2^{n+1}(n - 2) + 4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 16:08:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 14:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 17:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

Consequently, model size reduction has\nbecome an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of\ndeterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and\nquantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable\nto Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing\nweight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights\nallows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression\nrates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the\nnetwork weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits\ncorresponding to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the sampled\nvariational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a\nconstraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly\ncontrol the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the\ntraining set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the\noptimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed\nvariational family. Our method sets new state-of-the-art in neural network\ncompression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: On\nthe benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, our approach yields the best\ntest performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the\nhighest compression rates for a fixed test performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 18:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Under the proposed model, we study the\nproblem of the online allocation of a single resource to two types of\ncustomers, and design online algorithms that outperform existing ones. Our\nalgorithms are adjustable to the relative size of the stochastic component, and\nour analysis reveals that as the portion of the stochastic component grows, the\nloss due to making online decisions decreases.

In this paper, we introduce a structured\napproach for generating Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) with\nprocedural noise functions. Our approach unveils the systemic vulnerability of\npopular DCN models like Inception v3 and YOLO v3, with single noise patterns\nable to fool a model on up to 90% of the dataset. Procedural noise allows us to\ngenerate a distribution of UAPs with high universal evasion rates using only a\nfew parameters. Additionally, we propose Bayesian optimization to efficiently\nlearn procedural noise parameters to construct inexpensive untargeted black-box\nattacks. We demonstrate that it can achieve an average of less than 10 queries\nper successful attack, a 100-fold improvement on existing methods. We further\nmotivate the use of input-agnostic defences to increase the stability of models\nto adversarial perturbations. The universality of our attacks suggests that DCN\nmodels may be sensitive to aggregations of low-level class-agnostic features.\nThese findings give insight on the nature of some universal adversarial\nperturbations and how they could be generated in other applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 21:45:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 17:01:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 12:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 13:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

While many of the molecular components that make up\ncilia have been identified and studied, comparatively little is understood\nabout the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding these components. The\nconserved transcription factor Regulatory Factor X (RFX)/DAF-19, which acts\nthrough binding to the cis-regulatory motif known as X-box, has been shown to\nregulate ciliary genes in many animals from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans.\nHowever, accumulating evidence suggests that RFX is unable to initiate\ntranscription on its own. Therefore, other factors and cis-regulatory elements\nare likely required. One such element, a DNA motif called the C-box, has\nrecently been identified in C. elegans. It is still unclear if the X-box and\nC-boxes are the only regulatory elements involved and how they interact. To\nthis end, I analyzed the transcriptional regulation of dyf-5, the C. elegans\northolog of the human ciliopathy gene Male-Associated Kinase (MAK). Using\ncomputational methods, I was able to confirm the presence of the previously\nreported X-box and C-boxes as well as identifying an additional C-box. By\nsequentially mutating each of the identified motifs, I identified the role each\npotential motif plays in transcriptional regulation of dyf-5. My results showed\nthat only the X-box and the three C-boxes are necessary and are sufficient to\ndrive transcription, with the X-box and the centre C-box being the major\ncontributors and the other two C-boxes enhancing expression. This study\nadvances the knowledge of gene regulation in general and will further our\nunderstanding of ciliopathies and the mutations that cause them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 22:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

In contrast to ODFM\ntransmissions, NC-OFDM transmissions take place over a subset of active\nsubcarriers to either avoid incumbent transmissions or for strategic\nconsiderations. A point-to-point communication system is considered in this\npaper in the presence of an adversary (exploiter) that aims to infer\ntransmission parameters (e.g., the subset of active subcarriers and duration of\nthe signal) using a deep neural network (DNN). This method has been proposed\nsince the existing methods for exploitation, which are based on cyclostationary\nanalysis, have been shown to have limited success in NC-OFDM systems. A good\nestimation of the transmission parameters allows the adversary to transmit\nspurious data and attack the legitimate receiver. Simulation results show that\nthe DNN can infer the transmit parameters of OFDM signals with very good\naccuracy. However, NC-OFDM with fully random selection of active subcarriers\nmakes it difficult for the adversary to exploit the waveform and thus for the\nreceiver to be affected by the spurious data. Moreover, the more structured the\nset of active subcarriers selected by the transmitter is, the easier it is for\nthe adversary to infer the transmission parameters and attack the receiver\nusing a DNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 05:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Studies of\nelectronic dephasing in conventional metallic and semiconductor systems have\nnot only paved the way towards high coherence quantum electronics, but also led\nto fundamental new insights in condensed matter physics. In this work, we\nperform a spatially resolved study of electronic dephasing in three dimensional\ntopological insulators by exploiting an edge versus surface contacted\nmeasurement scheme. Unlike conventional two dimensional systems that are\ncharacterized by a single dephasing mechanism, we find that dephasing in our\nsamples evolves from a variable-range-hopping type mechanism on the sample\nsurface to a Nyquist type electron-electron interaction mechanism in the\nsub-surface layers. This is confirmed independently by the temperature and\nchemical potential dependence of the dephasing length, and gate dependent\nsuppression/enhancement of the weak anti-localization effect. Our devices are\nfabricated using bulk insulating topological insulator\nBiSbTe$_{1.25}$Se$_{1.75}$ capped with hexagonal-Boron Nitride in an inert\nenvironment, ruling out any extrinsic effects and confirming the topological\nsurface state origin of our results. Our work introduces the idea of spatially\nresolved electronic dephasing and reveals a new regime of coherent transport in\nperhaps the most important topological insulator discovered so far.

As we show here by means of density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations, this intrinsic dipole leads to the formation of built-in electric\nfields when the monolayers are stacked to form $N$-layer structures. For\nsufficiently thin structures ($N<4$) the dipoles add up and shift the vacuum\nlevel on the two sides of the film by $\\sim N \\cdot 0.7$ eV. However, for\nthicker films charge transfer occurs between the outermost layers forming\natomically thin n- and p-doped electron gasses at the two surfaces.

Gait fractality is apparent in healthy young\nadults but tends to disappear in elderly individuals and neurological patients.\nTherefore, its partial loss may be indicative of pathological conditions.\nDespite its potential to be used as a dynamical biomarker for fall risk\nassessment, the mechanistic origin of gait fractality has been investigated by\nonly a few studies, and even less attention has been devoted to the link\nbetween gait fractality and gait stability. Here, we propose a novel\ncomputational model of gait by addressing the flexibility-stability trade-off\nfirst, and then by showing that gait fractality is a natural consequence of the\ndeveloped control mechanisms, including phase resetting and intermittent\ncontrol, which supplement instability in a linear feedback controller operated\nat stability's edge.

Closeness is usually measured using the Hausdorff or Fr\\'echet\ndistance. These distance measures can be applied \"globally\", i.e., to the whole\ncurves $P$ and $P'$, or \"locally\", i.e., to each simplified subcurve and the\nline segment that it was replaced with separately (and then taking the\nmaximum). This gives rise to four problem variants: Global-Hausdorff (known to\nbe NP-hard), Local-Hausdorff (in time $O(n^3)$), Global-Fr\\'echet (in time $O(k\nn^5)$), and Local-Fr\\'echet (in time $O(n^3)$).\n  Our contribution is as follows.\n  - Cubic time for all variants: For Global-Fr\\'echet we design an algorithm\nrunning in time $O(n^3)$.

To obtain better precision, most studies focus on\ndesigning different objective functions with different constraints or penalty\nterms that consider neighborhood information. In this paper, in contrast to\nexisting hashing methods, we propose a novel generalized framework called\nfusion hashing (FH) to improve the precision of existing hashing methods\nwithout adding new constraints or penalty terms. In the proposed FH, given an\nexisting hashing method, we first execute it several times to get several\ndifferent hash codes for a set of training samples. We then propose two novel\nfusion strategies that combine these different hash codes into one set of final\nhash codes.

The nature of action potential\ntermination process in presence of sodium and potassium channel blockers are\ndistinct and physiologically very different from each other. Channel blockers\nhave distinct signatures on ionic currents. In presence of only sodium channel\nblockers the frequency of action potential generation falls off exponentially\nwith increasing drug affinity, whereas in contrast, for only potassium channel\nblockers initially an enhanced spiking activity of action potential is found\nfollowed by a gradual decrease of the spiking frequency as the drug affinity\nincreases.

Specifically, user activity can be successfully estimated\nwith a high probability when the signature sequence length exceeds a threshold;\notherwise, it fails with a high probability. The location and width of the\nphase transition region are characterized via the theory of conic integral\ngeometry. We further develop a smoothing method to solve the high-dimensional\nstructured estimation problem with a given limited time budget. This is\nachieved by sharply characterizing the convergence rate in terms of the\nsmoothing parameter, signature sequence length and estimation accuracy,\nyielding a trade-off between the estimation accuracy and computational cost.\nNumerical results are provided to illustrate the accuracy of our theoretical\nresults and the benefits of smoothing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 14:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

This work is mainly focused on\nthe adversarial training yet efficient FGSM adversary. In this scenario, it is\ndifficult to train a model with great generalization due to the lack of\nrepresentative adversarial samples, aka the samples are unable to accurately\nreflect the adversarial domain. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel\nAdversarial Training with Domain Adaptation (ATDA) method. Our intuition is to\nregard the adversarial training on FGSM adversary as a domain adaption task\nwith limited number of target domain samples. The main idea is to learn a\nrepresentation that is semantically meaningful and domain invariant on the\nclean domain as well as the adversarial domain. Empirical evaluations on\nFashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ATDA can greatly\nimprove the generalization of adversarial training and the smoothness of the\nlearned models, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark\ndatasets. To show the transfer ability of our method, we also extend ATDA to\nthe adversarial training on iterative attacks such as PGD-Adversial Training\n(PAT) and the defense performance is improved considerably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 14:52:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 09:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 13:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 08:43:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 05:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 11:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 08:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

This\ndocument can interest any student in Pure Mathematics in the topics of topology\nand category theory. The image-dense morphisms are clearly epimorphisms. To\netablish the converse, I use an analogous to the Kolmogorov quotient that I\ncall Hausdorff quotient. Thanks to this Hausdorff quotient, one can prove that\nthe Haus-category is a reflective subcategory of the category of topological\nspaces. As it is also a full subcategory, we deduce a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for a topological space to be Hausdorff. We use this condition to\nshow that if a morphism f:A->B is not image-dense, then the Hausdorff quotient\nof the quotient B/cl(f(A)) has at least two points. Moreover, we show that if f\nis an epimorphism, the Hausdorff quotient of the quotient B/cl(f(A)) has at\nmost one point.

The seismic signals collected at this\nsite contain different types of noises such as daily temperature variations,\nseasonal trends, animal movement near the geyser, and human activity. First, we\nfilter the signals from these noises by combining the Butterworth-Highpass\nfilter and an Autoregressive method in a multi-level fashion. We show that by\ncombining these filtering techniques, in a hierarchical fashion, leads to\nreduction in the noise in the seismic data without removing the precursors and\neruption event signals. We then use RF on the filtered data to classify the\nstate of geyser into three classes -- remnant noise, precursor, and eruption\nstates.

We then consider selected categories of people to understand their\ndistinct needs when acting as groups and as communities.

Smart network systems are intelligent autonomously-operating\nnetworks, a new form of global computational infrastructure that includes\nblockchains, deep learning, and autonomous-strike UAVs. These kinds of\nlarge-scale networks are a contemporary reality with thousands, millions, and\nbillions of constituent elements, and entail a foundational and\ntheoretically-robust model for their design and operation. Hence this work\nproposes smart network field theory, drawing from statistical physics,\neffective field theories, and model systems, for criticality detection and\nfleet-many item orchestration in smart network systems. Smart network field\ntheory falls within the broader concern of technophysics (the application of\nphysics to the study of technology), in which a key objective is deriving\nstandardized methods for assessing system criticality and phase transition, and\ndefining interim system structure between the levels of microscopic noise and\nmacroscopic labels. The farther implications of this work include the\npossibility of recasting the P/NP computational complexity schema as one no\nlonger based on traditional time (concurrency) and space constraints, due to\nthe availability of smart network computational resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 11:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Together, they represent a compelling\nset of stylized facts regarding the overall statistics, the innovation rate and\nthe scaling of fluctuations for systems as diverse as written texts and cities,\necological systems and stock markets. Many modeling schemes have been proposed\nin literature to explain those laws, but only recently a modeling framework has\nbeen introduced that accounts for the emergence of those laws without deducing\nthe emergence of one of the laws from the others or without ad hoc assumptions.\nThis modeling framework is based on the concept of adjacent possible space and\nits key feature of being dynamically restructured while its boundaries get\nexplored, i.e., conditional to the occurrence of novel events. Here, we\nillustrate this approach and show how this simple modelling framework,\ninstantiated through a modified Polya's urn model, is able reproduce Zipf's,\nHeaps' and Taylor's laws within a unique self-consistent scheme. In addition\nthe same modelling scheme embraces other less common evolutionary laws (Hoppe's\nmodel and Dirichlet processes) as particular cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 21:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}
