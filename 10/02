Robots need to accurately predict human's future movement in order\nto safely plan its own motion trajectories and efficiently collaborate with\nhumans. Many recent approaches predict human's movement using deep learning\nmethods, such as recurrent neural networks. However, existing methods lack the\nability to adapt to time-varying human behaviors, and many of them do not\nquantify uncertainties in the prediction. This paper proposes an approach that\nuses a semi-adaptable neural network for human motion prediction, and provides\nuncertainty bounds of the predictions in real time. In particular, a neural\nnetwork is trained offline to represent the human motion transition model, and\nthen recursive least square parameter adaptation algorithm (RLS-PAA) is adopted\nfor online parameter adaptation of the neural network and for uncertainty\nestimation. Experiments on several human motion datasets verify that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach in\nterms of prediction accuracy and computation efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 16:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 22:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

In order to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the tumour invasion process, we pay special attention to the\ninteracting dynamics between the cancer cell population and various\nconstituents of the surrounding tumour microenvironment. To that end, we\nconsider the key role that ECM plays within the human body tissue, providing\nnot only structure and support to surrounding cells, but also acting as a\nplatform for cells communication and spatial movement. There are several other\nvital structures within the ECM, however we are going to focus primarily on\nfibrous proteins, such as fibronectin.

Probably the most important is the\nnumber of mitotic figures which are most commonly determined as the mitotic\ncount (MC), i.e. number of mitotic figures within 10 consecutive high power\nfields. Often the area with the highest mitotic activity is to be selected for\nthe MC. However, since mitotic activity is not known in advance, an arbitrary\nchoice of this region is considered one important cause for high variability in\nthe prognostication and grading.\n  In this work, we present an algorithmic approach that first calculates a\nmitotic cell map based upon a deep convolutional network. This map is in a\nsecond step used to construct a mitotic activity estimate. Lastly, we select\nthe image segment representing the size of ten high power fields with the\noverall highest mitotic activity as a region proposal for an expert MC\ndetermination. We evaluate the approach using a dataset of 32 completely\nannotated whole slide images, where 22 were used for training of the network\nand 10 for test.

This sloshing has resulted in cold fronts, at distances of 55, 115\nand 320 kpc from the cluster center.

These cavities are the X-ray manifestations of radio bubbles inflated\nby the AGN, and may explain the motion of cold molecular CO clouds previously\nobserved with ALMA. The estimated mechanical power of the AGN, using the\nminimum energy required to inflate the cavities as a proxy, is $P_{\\rm cav} =\n(1.1 \\pm 1.0) \\times 10^{44} $ erg s$^{-1}$, which may be enough to drive the\nmolecular gas flows, and offset the cooling luminosity of the ICM, at $L_{\\rm\ncool} = (1.90 \\pm0.01)\\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

With our new high-performance general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\n(GRMHD) code H-AMR we have simulated the thinnest accretion disc to date, of\naspect ratio H/R~0.03, around a rapidly spinning (a=0.9375) black hole, using a\ncooling function.

The disc develops a\nlow-density high-viscosity (alpha_eff ~ 1.0) magnetic-pressure--dominated inner\nregion at r<25 r_g that rapidly empties itself into the black hole. This inner\nregion may in reality, due to thermal decoupling of ions and electrons,\nevaporate into a radiatively inefficient accretion flow if, as we propose, the\ncooling time exceeds the accretion time set by the order unity effective\nviscosity. We furthermore find the unexpected result that even our very thin\ndisc can sustain large-scale vertical magnetic flux on the black hole, which\nlaunches powerful relativistic jets that carry 20-50% of the accretion power\nalong the angular momentum vector of the outer tilted disc, providing a\npotential explanation for the origin of jets in radio-loud quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 16:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

One example is Hutchinson's `paradox of the plankton'.\nThis is an instance where a large number of phytoplankton species coexist while\ncompeting for a very limited number of resources. Both experimental and\ntheoretical studies have shown that temporal fluctuations of the environment\ncan facilitate coexistence for competing species. Hutchinson conjectured that\none can get coexistence because nonequilibrium conditions would make it\npossible for different species to be favored by the environment at different\ntimes.\n  In this paper we show in various settings how a variable (stochastic)\nenvironment enables a set of competing species limited by a smaller number of\nresources or other density dependent factors to coexist. If the environmental\nfluctuations are modeled by white noise, and the per-capita growth rates of the\ncompetitors depend linearly on the resources, we prove that there is\ncompetitive exclusion.

One of the most important problem\nremains secure and effective mechanisms for the key distillation process. This\narticle presents a new idea for a key reconciliation method in quantum\ncryptography. This proposal assumes the use of mutual synchronization of\nartificial neural networks to correct errors occurring during transmission in\nthe quantum channel. Users can build neural networks based on their own string\nof bits. The typical value of the quantum bit error rate does not exceed a few\npercent, therefore the strings are similar and also users' neural networks are\nvery similar at the beginning of the learning process. It has been shown that\nthe synchronization process in the new solution is much faster than in the\nanalogous scenario used in neural cryptography. This feature significantly\nincreases the level of security because a potential eavesdropper cannot\neffectively synchronize their own artificial neural networks in order to obtain\ninformation about the key.

Yet many\nof the remaining unknowns of stellar evolution lie in the birth, life, and\ndeath of these objects. We review stellar evolution of intermediate-mass (IMS)\nZ<=10-5 models existing in the literature, with a focus on the problem of their\nfinal fates. The depth and efficiency of mixing episodes are critical to\ndetermine the mass limits for the formation of electron-capture supernovae, but\nour knowledge of these phenomena is not complete because they are strongly\naffected by the choice of input physics. We also consider the alternative\nSNI1/2 channel to form SNe out of the most metal-poor IMS. In this case, it is\ncritical to understand the thermally-pulsing AGB evolution until the late\nstages. Efficient second dredge-up and, later, third dredge-up episodes could\nbe able to pollute stellar envelopes enough for the stars to undergo thermal\npulses in a way very similar to that of higher initial Z objects. Inefficient\n2nd and/or 3rd dredge-up may leave an almost pristine envelope, unable to\nsustain strong stellar winds. This may allow the H-exhausted core to grow to\nM_Ch before the envelope is lost, and thus let the star explode as a SNI1/2.\nAfter reviewing the information available on these two possible channels for\nthe formation of SNe, we discuss existing nucleosynthetic yields of stars of\nmetallicity Z<=10^-5, and present an example of nucleosynthetic calculations\nfor a thermally-pulsing Super-AGB star of Z=10^-5.

As a result, HomT is\ndeemed especially desirable in settings with heterogeneous (and possibly\npossessing dynamically changing) processing capacities.

To prevent a\nviolation of causality, this simulation succeeds up to local errors that can\nonly be corrected after the parties communicate classically with one another.\nHowever, this communication is non-interactive, and it involves just the\nbroadcasting of local measurement outcomes. We refer to this operational\nparadigm as local operations and broadcast communication (LOBC) to distinguish\nit from the standard local operations and (interactive) classical communication\n(LOCC). In this paper, we show that an arbitrary two-qubit gate can be\nimplemented by LOBC with $\\epsilon$-error using $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ entangled\nbits (ebits). This offers an exponential improvement over the best known\ntwo-qubit protocols, whose ebit costs behave as $O(1/\\epsilon)$. We also\nconsider the family of binary controlled gates on dimensions $d_A\\otimes d_B$.\nWe find that any hermitian gate of this form can be implemented by LOBC using a\nsingle shared ebit. In sharp contrast, a lower bound of $\\log d_B$ ebits is\nshown in the case of generic (i.e. non-hermitian) gates from this family, even\nwhen $d_A=2$. This demonstrates an unbounded gap between the entanglement costs\nof LOCC and LOBC gate implementation. Whereas previous lower bounds on the\nentanglement cost for instantaneous nonlocal computation restrict the minimum\ndimension of the needed entanglement, we bound its entanglement entropy. To our\nknowledge this is the first such lower bound of its kind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 22:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

A smaller $d$ results in smaller\noptimization error. We come with a new, simple, and parameter-free approach.\nFirst, for all values of $b$ and $d$, this approach recovers at least the\nstate-of-the-art regret guarantees. Second, our approach additionally obtains\nthese results while being \\textit{agnostic} to the values of both $b$ and $d$.\nThis leads to the first algorithm that naturally adapts to an \\textit{unknown}\nrange of noise $b$ and leads to significant improvements in a moderate and\nlow-noise regime.

Polar direct drive (PDD) on the National\nIgnition Facility (NIF) requires the repointing of its 192 beams clustered\nwithin 50 degrees of the poles to minimize the imparted polar varying payload\nkinetic energy of the target. Due to this repointing, non-normal incidence\nangles of the beam centerlines are encountered in any PDD design. The\nformulation of a PDD scheme that minimizes non-uniformity is a significant\nchallenge that requires an understanding of the induced differences in ablation\nincluding those of incidence angle. In this work, a modified version of the\ntextbook model of laser ablation [Manheimer et al. Phys. Fluids 25, 1644\n(1982)] is used to demonstrate that the mass ablation rate and ablation\npressure scale with the 4/3 and 2/3 power of the cosine of the laser ray\nincidence angle for the planar case during the beginning portion of the laser\nablation. This result is considered with an idealized 1-D two segment planar\nmodel using rays at different incidence angles for each segment. Within the\nmodel, the segments cannot have equal mass and velocity simultaneously without\ntailoring the ray's time-dependent intensity for each segment. However, with\nthe correct segment-to-segment time-independent ray intensities, equal velocity\nand dynamic pressure can be achieved approximately without tailoring.\nAdditionally, an analytic prediction for the conduction zone width as a\nfunction of incidence angle is provided. It is predicted that this width\nincreases with incidence angle, resulting in a decrease in laser imprint, an\neffect which has been previously observed in experiments. These results, when\ngeneralized to spherical geometry, may provide insight into the implosion\ndynamics encountered in PDD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 22:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

As a consequence, some physical\nquantities computed from the tensor show unphysical behavior. For example, the\npresence of a spin-polarized current does not affect the energy of the domain\nwall in the commonly accepted gauge, which implies-incorrectly-the absence of\nthe adiabatic spin torque. In other gauges, the spin torque shows unphysical\nglitches occurring when the plane of magnetization crosses the Dirac string\nassociated with a magnetic monopole in spin space. We derive a gauge-invariant\nenergy-momentum tensor that is free from these artifacts but requires the\naddition of an extra spatial dimension, with the ferromagnet living on its\nboundary. It can be obtained most directly from the Wess-Zumino action for\nspins, which relies on the same extra dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 23:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 13:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

For instance, the observed reward\nchannel is often subject to noise in practice (e.g., when rewards are collected\nthrough sensors), and is therefore not credible. In addition, for applications\nsuch as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be\nmanipulated to produce arbitrary errors by receiving corrupted rewards. In this\npaper, we consider noisy RL problems with perturbed rewards, which can be\napproximated with a confusion matrix. We develop a robust RL framework that\nenables agents to learn in noisy environments where only perturbed rewards are\nobserved. Our solution framework builds on existing RL/DRL algorithms and\nfirstly addresses the biased noisy reward setting without any assumptions on\nthe true distribution (e.g., zero-mean Gaussian noise as made in previous\nworks). The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion\nmatrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the\nconvergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on\ndifferent DRL platforms show that trained policies based on our estimated\nsurrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than\nexisting baselines.

Although the planning methodologies vary\nfrom platform to platform, many algorithms adopt a hierarchical planning\narchitecture where a slow, low-fidelity global planner guides a fast,\nhigh-fidelity local planner. However, in unknown environments, this approach\ncan lead to erratic or unstable behavior due to the interaction between the\nglobal planner, whose solution is changing constantly, and the local planner; a\nconsequence of not capturing higher-order dynamics in the global plan. This\nwork proposes a planning framework in which multi-fidelity models are used to\nreduce the discrepancy between the local and global planner.

To combat this,\nwe introduce a simple technique for suppressing systematic coherent errors in\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) stabilizer codes, which we call stabilizer\nslicing. The essential idea is to slice low-weight stabilizers into two\nequally-weighted Pauli operators and then apply them by rotating in opposite\ndirections, causing their overrotations to interfere destructively on the\nlogical subspace.\n  With access to native gates generated by 3-body Hamiltonians, we can\ncompletely eliminate purely coherent overrotation errors, and for overrotation\nnoise of 0.99 unitarity we achieve a 135-fold improvement in the logical error\nrate of Surface-17. For more conventional 2-body ion trap gates, we observe an\n89-fold improvement for Bacon-Shor-13 with purely coherent errors which should\nbe testable in near-term fault-tolerance experiments. This second scheme takes\nadvantage of the prepared gauge degrees of freedom, and to our knowledge is the\nfirst example in which the state of the gauge directly affects the robustness\nof a code's memory.

Our analysis finds that 82% of the top 200 free apps in a popular Android\napp store have complete access to stored photos and network on a user's\nsmartphone, which indicates possible private photo leakage.

A common feature of\nthese problems is that their optimal clusterings no longer have the locality\nproperty (due to the additional constraints), which is a key property required\nby many algorithms for their unconstrained counterparts. To overcome the\ndifficulty caused by the loss of locality, we present in this paper a unified\nframework, called {\\em Peeling-and-Enclosing (PnE)}, to iteratively solve two\nvariants of the constrained clustering problems, {\\em constrained $k$-means\nclustering} ($k$-CMeans) and {\\em constrained $k$-median clustering}\n($k$-CMedian). Our framework is based on two standalone geometric techniques,\ncalled {\\em Simplex Lemma} and {\\em Weaker Simplex Lemma}, for $k$-CMeans and\n$k$-CMedian, respectively. The simplex lemma (or weaker simplex lemma) enables\nus to efficiently approximate the mean (or median) point of an unknown set of\npoints by searching a small-size grid, independent of the dimensionality of the\nspace, in a simplex (or the surrounding region of a simplex), and thus can be\nused to handle high dimensional data. If $k$ and $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ are fixed\nnumbers, our framework generates, in nearly linear time ({\\em i.e.,} $O(n(\\log\nn)^{k+1}d)$), $O((\\log n)^{k})$ $k$-tuple candidates for the $k$ mean or median\npoints, and one of them induces a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for $k$-CMeans\nor $k$-CMedian, where $n$ is the number of points. Combining this unified\nframework with a problem-specific selection algorithm (which determines the\nbest $k$-tuple candidate), we obtain a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for each of\nthe constrained clustering problems. We expect that our technique will be\napplicable to other constrained clustering problems without locality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 03:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Empirical and theoretical results clearly\nindicate that the DNN training process itself implicitly implements a form of\nSelf-Regularization. The empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices\ndisplays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in\nthe absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit\nregularization. Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most notably its\nextension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, we develop a theory\nto identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of\nImplicit Self-Regularization. These phases can be observed during the training\nprocess as well as in the final learned DNNs. For smaller and/or older DNNs,\nthis Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization,\nin that there is a \"size scale\" separating signal from noise.

This results from correlations arising at all\nsize scales, which arises implicitly due to the training process itself. This\nimplicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the\ntraining process. By exploiting the generalization gap phenomena, we\ndemonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of\ntraining simply by changing the batch size.

A layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncentres engineered near the diamond surface is employed to obtain spatial maps\nof the vector magnetic field, by measuring Zeeman shifts through\noptically-detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The in-plane magnetic field\n(i.e. parallel to the diamond surface) is found to be significantly weaker than\npredicted, while the out-of-plane field also exhibits an unexpected modulation.\nWe show that the measured magnetic field is incompatible with Ampere's\ncircuital law or Gauss's law for magnetism when we assume that the current is\nconfined to the metal, independent of the details of the current density. This\nresult was reproduced in several diamond samples, with a measured deviation\nfrom Ampere's law by as much as 94(6)\\%. To resolve this apparent magnetic\nanomaly, we introduce a generalised description whereby the current is allowed\nto flow both above the NV sensing layer (including in the metallic wire) and\nbelow the NV layer (i.e. in the diamond). Inversion of the Biot-Savart law\nwithin this two-channel description leads to a unique solution for the two\ncurrent densities, which completely explains the data, is consistent with the\nlaws of classical electrodynamics and indicates a total NV-measured current\nthat closely matches the electrically-measured current.

In this model, we assume that agents submit full rankings\nover the alternatives, and these rankings are generated from underlying, but\nunknown, quantitative costs. The \\emph{distortion} of a social choice rule is\nthen the ratio of the total social cost of the chosen alternative to the\noptimal social cost of any alternative; since the true costs are unknown, we\nconsider the worst-case distortion over all possible underlying costs.\nAnalogously, we can consider the worst-case \\emph{fairness ratio} of a social\nchoice rule by comparing a useful notion of fairness (based on approximate\nmajorization) for the chosen alternative to that of the optimal alternative.\nWith an additional metric assumption -- that the costs equal the\nagent-alternative distances in some metric space -- it is known that the\nCopeland rule achieves both a distortion and fairness ratio of at most 5. For\nother rules, only bounds on the distortion are known, e.g., the popular Single\nTransferable Vote (STV) rule has distortion $O(\\log m)$, where $m$ is the\nnumber of alternatives. We prove that the distinct notions of distortion and\nfairness ratio are in fact closely linked -- within an additive factor of 2 for\nany voting rule -- and thus STV also achieves an $O(\\log m)$ fairness ratio. We\nfurther extend the notions of distortion and fairness ratio to social choice\nrules choosing a \\emph{set} of alternatives. By relating the distortion of\nsingle-winner rules to multiple-winner rules, we establish that Recursive\nCopeland achieves a distortion of 5 and a fairness ratio of at most 7 for\nchoosing a set of alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 07:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

We\ndevelop a rank-1 projection algorithm that recovers the signal subject to\nensuring consistency with the measurement, that is, the recovered signal when\nencoded must yield the same set of measurements that one started with. The\nrank-1 projection stems from the idea of lifting, originally proposed in the\ncontext of PhaseLift. The consistency criterion is enforced using a one-sided\nquadratic cost. We also determine the probability with which different vectors\nlead to the same set of quantized measurements, which makes it impossible to\nresolve them. Naturally, this probability depends on how correlated such\nvectors are, and how coarsely/finely the measurements get quantized. The\nproposed algorithm is also capable of incorporating a sparsity constraint on\nthe signal. An analysis of the cost function reveals that it is bounded, both\nabove and below, by functions that are dependent on how well correlated the\nestimate is with the ground truth. We also derive the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound\n(CRB) on the achievable reconstruction accuracy. A comparison with the\nstate-of-the- art algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm has a higher\nreconstruction accuracy and is about 2 to 3 dB away from the CRB. The edge, in\nterms of the reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio, over the competing\nalgorithms is higher (about 5 to 6 dB) when the quantization is coarse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 07:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

It allows them to find food and\nto escape from toxins. Many microorganisms can produce the chemicals to which\nthey respond themselves and use chemotaxis for signalling which can be seen as\na basic form of communication. Remarkably, the past decade has let to the\ndevelopment of synthetic microswimmers like e.g. autophoretic Janus colloids,\nwhich can self-propel through a solvent, analogously to bacteria and other\nmicroorganims. The mechanism underlying their self-propulsion involves the\nproduction of certain chemicals. The same chemicals involved in the\nself-propulsion mechanism also act on other microswimmers and bias their\nswimming direction towards (or away from) the producing microswimmer. Synthetic\nmicroswimmers therefore provide a synthetic analogue to chemotactic motile\nmicroorganisms. When these interactions are attractive, they commonly lead to\nclusters, even at low particle density. These clusters may either proceed\ntowards macrophase separation, resembling Dictyostelium aggregation, or, as\nshown very recently, lead to dynamic clusters of self-limited size (dynamic\nclustering) as seen in experiments in autophoretic Janus colloids. Besides the\nclassical case where chemical interactions are attractive, this Account\ndiscusses, as its main focus, repulsive chemical interactions, which can create\na new and less known avenue to pattern formation in active systems leading to a\nvariety of pattern, including clusters which are surrounded by shells of\nchemicals, travelling waves and more complex continously reshaping patterns. In\nall these cases `synthetic signalling' can crucially determine the collective\nbehavior of synthetic microswimmer ensembles and can be used as a design\nprinciple to create patterns in motile active particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 08:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

This observation is\nquantified by the theory of bet-hedging, which provides a reason for the degree\nof phenotypic diversity observed even in clonal populations. The theory of\nbet-hedging in well-mixed populations is rather well developed. However, many\nspecies underwent range expansions during their evolutionary history, and the\nimportance of phenotypic diversity in such scenarios still needs to be\nunderstood. In this paper, we develop a theory of bet-hedging for populations\ncolonizing new, unknown environments that fluctuate either in space or time. In\nthis case, we find that bet-hedging is a more favorable strategy than in\nwell-mixed populations. For slow rates of variation, temporal and spatial\nfluctuations lead to different outcomes. In spatially fluctuating environments,\nbet-hedging is favored compared to temporally fluctuating environments. In the\nlimit of frequent environmental variation, no opportunity for bet-hedging\nexists, regardless of the nature of the environmental fluctuations. For the\nsame model, bet-hedging is never an advantageous strategy in the well-mixed\ncase, supporting the view that range expansions strongly promote\ndiversification. These conclusions are robust against stochasticity induced by\nfinite population sizes. Our findings shed light on the importance of\nphenotypic heterogeneity in range expansions, paving the way to novel\napproaches to understand how biodiversity emerges and is maintained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 09:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Here we present a\nsystematic study of the concentration dependence of the structural and dynamic\nproperties of monoclonal antibodies using a combination of different scattering\nmethods and microrheological experiments.

CSC brings a natural\nremedy to the limitation of typical sparse enforcing approaches of handling\nglobal and high-dimensional signals by local, patch-based, processing. While\nthe classic field of sparse representations has been able to cater for the\ndiverse challenges of different signal processing tasks by considering a wide\nrange of problem formulations, almost all available algorithms that deploy the\nCSC model consider the same $\\ell_1 - \\ell_2$ problem form.

Proactive caching, as one of the key\nfeatures offered by 5G networks, has lately received much interest. However,\nmore research is still needed to convey large-sized multimedia content\nincluding video, audio and pictures to the high speed moving vehicles. In this\npaper, we study the gains achieved by proactive caching in Roadside Units\n(RSUs) where we take into consideration the effect of the vehicle velocity on\nthe optimal caching decision. Information about the user demand and mobility is\nharnessed to cache some files in RSUs, which will communicate with vehicles\ntraversing along the visited roads before the actual demand. Our main objective\nis to minimize the total network latency. Towards this objective, we formulate\ntwo optimization problems for non-cooperative and cooperative caching schemes\nto find the optimal caching policy to decide which files to be cached by the\nRSUs. Due to the complexity of these problems, we propose a sub-optimal caching\npolicy for each scheme. We compare the performance of the optimal caching\npolicy to that of the sub-optimal caching policy. Numerical results show that\nproactive caching has a significant performance gain when compared to the\nbaseline reactive scenario. Moreover, results reveal that the cooperative\ncaching scheme is more efficient than the non-cooperative scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 11:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

In SPDC, a pump photon interacts with a\nnonlinear optical crystal and splits into two entangled photons called the\nsignal and the idler photons. The SPDC process has been studied extensively in\nthe last few decades for various pump and crystal configurations, and the\nentangled photon pairs produced by SPDC have been used in numerous experimental\nstudies on quantum entanglement and entanglement-based real-world\nquantum-information applications. In this tutorial article, we present a\nthorough study of phase matching in $\\beta$-barium borate (BBO) crystals for\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion and thereby also investigate the\ngeneration of entangled photons in such crystals. First, we present a\ntheoretical derivation of two-photon wavefunction produced by SPDC in the\nfrequency and transverse momentum bases. We then discuss in detail the effects\ndue to various crystal and pump parameters including the length of the crystal,\nthe angle between the optic axis and the pump propagation direction, the pump\nincidence angle on the crystal surface, the refraction at the crystal surfaces,\nand the pump propagation direction inside the crystal. These effects are\nextremely relevant in experimental situations. We then present our numerical\nand experimental results in order to illustrate how various experimental\nparameters affect the phase matching and thus the generation of entangled\nphotons. Finally, using the two-photon wavefunction in the transverse\nwave-vector basis, we show how to derive the two-photon wavefunction in the OAM\nbasis and thereby calculate the two-photon angular Schmidt spectrum. We expect\nthis article to be useful for researchers working in various capacities with\nentangled photons generated by SPDC in BBO crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 11:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 12:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 13:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Next,\nwe design and analyze another TS algorithm with Gaussian updates, TS-Cascade.\nTS-Cascade achieves the state-of-the-art regret bound for cascading bandits.\nComplementarily, we consider a linear generalization of the cascading bandit\nmodel, which allows efficient learning in large cascading bandit problem\ninstances. We introduce and analyze a TS algorithm, which enjoys a regret bound\nthat depends on the dimension of the linear model but not the number of items.\nFinally, by using information-theoretic techniques and judiciously constructing\ncascading bandit instances, we derive a nearly matching regret lower bound for\nthe standard model.

This paper develops a sampler for arbitrary continuous\nmultivariate distributions that is based on low-rank surrogates in the\ntensor-train format. We construct a tensor-train approximation to the target\nprobability density function using the cross interpolation, which requires a\nsmall number of function evaluations. For sufficiently smooth distributions the\nstorage required for the TT approximation is moderate, scaling linearly with\ndimension. The structure of the tensor-train surrogate allows efficient\nsampling by the conditional distribution method. Unbiased estimates may be\ncalculated by correcting the transformed random seeds using a\nMetropolis--Hastings accept/reject step. Moreover, one can use a more efficient\nquasi-Monte Carlo quadrature that may be corrected either by a control-variate\nstrategy, or by importance weighting. We show that the error in the\ntensor-train approximation propagates linearly into the Metropolis--Hastings\nrejection rate and the integrated autocorrelation time of the resulting Markov\nchain. These methods are demonstrated in three computed examples: fitting\nfailure time of shock absorbers; a PDE-constrained inverse diffusion problem;\nand sampling from the Rosenbrock distribution. The delayed rejection adaptive\nMetropolis (DRAM) algorithm is used as a benchmark.

Metal-poor massive stars are supposed to be progenitors of certain\nsupernovae, gamma-ray bursts and compact object mergers, potentially\ncontributing to the early epochs of the Universe with their strong ionizing\nradiation. However, they remain mainly theoretical as individual spectroscopic\nobservations of such objects have rarely been carried out below the metallicity\nof the SMC.\n  Aims. This work aims at exploring what our state-of-the-art theories of\nstellar evolution combined with those of stellar atmospheres predict about a\ncertain type of metal-poor (0.02 Z$_{\\odot}$) hot massive stars, the chemically\nhomogeneously evolving ones, called TWUIN stars.\n  Methods. Synthetic spectra corresponding to a broad range in masses (20-130\nM$_{\\odot}$) and covering several evolutionary phases from the zero-age\nmain-sequence up to the core helium-burning stage were computed.\n  Results. We find that TWUIN stars show almost no emission lines during most\nof their {core hydrogen-burning} lifetimes. Most metal lines are completely\nabsent, including nitrogen. During their core helium-burning stage, lines\nswitch to emission and even some metal lines (oxygen and carbon, but still\nalmost no nitrogen) show up. Mass loss and clumping play a significant role in\nline-formation in later evolutionary phases, particularly during core\nhelium-burning. Most of our spectra are classified as an early O type giant or\nsupergiant, and we find Wolf-Rayet stars of type WO in the core helium-burning\nphase.\n  Conclusions. An extremely hot, early O type star observed in a\nlow-metallicity galaxy could be the outcome of chemically homogeneous evolution\n$-$ and therefore the progenitor of a long-duration gamma-ray burst or a type\nIc supernova. TWUIN stars may play an important role in reionizing the Universe\ndue to their being hot without showing prominent emission lines during the\nmajority of their lifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 14:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 11:30:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 11:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

A similar phenomenon appears when one considers an Einsteinian\nblack hole and a shell of matter placed at some distance from it, so that\nastrophysical estimates could be made for the allowed mass of the black hole\nenvironment. While echoes for both systems have been extensively studied\nrecently, no such analysis has been done for a system featuring phenomena\nsimultaneously, that is, echoes due to new physics near the surface/event\nhorizon and echoes due to matter at some distance from the black hole. Here,\nfollowing [9, 11], we consider a traversable wormhole obtained by identifying\ntwo Schwarzschild metrics with the same mass M at the throat, which is near the\nSchwarzschild radius, and add a nonthin shell of matter at a distance. This\nallows us to understand how the echoes of the surface of the compact object are\naffected by the astrophysical environment at a distance.

Conditional on a\nhypothesis on the vanishing of some of these cohomology groups, we calculate\nthe moments of the L-function and they match the predictions of the\nConrey-Farmer-Keating-Rubinstein-Snaith recipe.\n  In this case, the decomposition into irreducible representations seems to\nseparate the main term and error term, which are mixed together in the long\nsums obtained from the approximate functional equation, even when it is\ndyadically decomposed. This makes our heuristic statement relatively simple,\nonce the geometric background is set up. We hope that this will clarify the\nsituation in more difficult cases like the L-functions of quadratic Dirichlet\ncharacters to squarefree modulus. There is also some hope for a geometric proof\nof this cohomological hypothesis, which would resolve the moment problem for\nthese L-functions in the large degree limit over function fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 14:39:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 18:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Here, we develop an empirical model of the solar wind parameters\nat the inner boundary (18 solar radii, Rs) used in our global, 3D MHD model\n(G3DMHD) or other equivalent ones. The model takes solar magnetic field maps at\n2.5 Rs (which is based on the Potential Field Source Surface, PFSS model) and\ninterpolates the solar wind plasma and field out to 18 Rs using the algorithm\nof Wang and Sheeley [1990a]. A formula V_{18Rs} = V1 + V2 fs^{\\alpha} is used\nto calculate the solar wind speed at 18 Rs, where V1 is in a range of 150-350\nkm/s, V2 is in the range of 250-500 km/s, and fs is an expansion factor, which\nwas derived from the Wang and Sheeley (WS) algorithm at 2.5 Rs. To estimate the\nsolar wind density and temperature at 18 Rs, we assume an incompressible solar\nwind and a constant total pressure.

For these problems, various heuristic optimization\nmethods have been proposed. Comparing the results of these solvers requires the\ndefinition of suitable metrics. In the electrical energy systems literature,\nsimple metrics such as best value obtained, the mean value, the median or the\nstandard deviation of the solutions are still used. However, the comparisons\ncarried out with these metrics are rather weak, and on these bases a somehow\nuncontrolled proliferation of heuristic solvers is taking place. This paper\naddresses the overall issue of understanding the reasons of this proliferation,\nshowing a conceptual scheme that indicates how the assessment of the best\nsolver may result in the unlimited formulation of new solvers. Moreover, this\npaper shows how the use of more refined metrics defined to compare the\noptimization result, associated with the definition of appropriate benchmarks,\nmay make the comparisons among the solvers more robust. The proposed metrics\nare based on the concept of first-order stochastic dominance and are defined\nfor the cases in which: (i) the globally optimal solution can be found (for\ntesting purposes); and (ii) the number of possible solutions is so large that\npractically it cannot be guaranteed that the global optimum has been found.\nIllustrative examples are provided for a typical problem in the electrical\nenergy systems area-distribution network reconfiguration.

The main purpose of this paper is to\nestablish the concept and the architecture of the whole system. The system\nwhich we are able to develop still now is basically a demonstration model or a\nprototype of the system. The key thing in this system is the passive RFID tags\nwhich will be hidden inside the car and act as a unique identification number\nfor the car. The information of all such tags will be maintained by a\ncentralized server. In case of any car being theft, a report should be logged\ninto the server by an authorized user and a network of RFID scanners installed\nin different check post, traffic signal or toll plazas in the city will search\nfor the reported tag. Once it is found necessary security system would be\nactivated for arresting the car.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 06:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}
