We show that the strains of minimizing sequences associated to\nre-scaled non linear energies weakly converge, up to subsequences, to the\nstrains of minimizers of a limit energy, provided an additional compatibility\ncondition is fulfilled by the force field. The limit energy is different from\nclassical energy of linear elasticity; nevertheless the compatibility condition\nentails the coincidence of related minima and minimizers. A strong violation of\nthis condition provides a limit energy which is unbounded from below, while a\nmild violation may produce a limit energy with infinitely many extra minimizers\nwhich are not minimizers of standard linear elastic energy and whose strains\nare not uniformly bounded. A relevant consequence of this analysis is that a\nrigorous validation of linear elasticity fails for compressive force fields\nthat do not fulfil such compatibility condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 16:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 12:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

In this setting,\nthe mean of an ensemble of maps can be defined as the Riemannian center of mass\non either of these groups. We apply this decomposition in the context of\nLagrangian averaging where equations of motion for the mean flow arise via a\nvariational principle from a mean Lagrangian, obtained from the kinetic energy\nLagrangian of ideal fluid flow via a small amplitude expansion for the\nfluctuations.\n  We show that the Euler-$\\alpha$ equations arise as Lagrangian averaged Euler\nequations when using the $L^2$-geodesic mean on the volume preserving\ndiffeomorphism group of a manifold without boundaries, imposing a `Taylor\nhypothesis', which states that first order fluctuations are transported as a\nvector field by the mean flow, and assuming that fluctuations are statistically\nisotropic. Similarly, the EPDiff equations arise as the Lagrangian averaged\nBurgers' equations using the same argument on the full diffeomorphism group.\nThese results generalize an earlier observation by Oliver (Proc. R. Soc. A,\n2017) to manifolds in geometrically fully intrinsic terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 17:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

In fact, mass-radius\nrelationships of transiting planets suggest that some close-in super-Earths\npossess H$_2$/He atmospheres of ~ 0.1-10% by mass. Previous studies indicated\nthat properties of a disk gas such as metallicity and the inflow/outflow cycle\nof a disk gas around a super-Earth can regulate accumulation of a H$_2$/He\natmosphere onto itself. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism that radial\nmass accretion in a disk can limit the gas accretion onto super-Earth cores.\nRecent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations found that magnetically driven disk\nwinds can drive a rapid gas flow near the disk surface. Such a rapid gas flow\nmay slip out of a planetary core and regulate gas supply to an accreting gas\nonto the core. We performed N-body simulations for formation of super-Earths\nwith accretion of atmospheres in a viscous accretion disk including effects of\nwind-driven accretion. We found that even super-Earth cores can avoid\ntriggering runaway gas accretion if the inflow of a disk gas toward the cores\nis limited by viscous accretion. Our model predicts that super-Earths having\nH$_2$/He atmosphere of ~ 0.1-10 wt % form within $\\lesssim$ 1 au of the central\nstar, whereas gas giants are born in the outer region.

While graphs are effective in\nmodeling complex relationships, in many scenarios a single graph is rarely\nsufficient to succinctly represent all interactions, and hence multi-layered\ngraphs have become popular. Though this leads to richer representations,\nextending solutions from the single-graph case is not straightforward.\nConsequently, there is a strong need for novel solutions to solve classical\nproblems, such as node classification, in the multi-layered case. In this\npaper, we consider the problem of semi-supervised learning with multi-layered\ngraphs. Though deep network embeddings, e.g. DeepWalk, are widely adopted for\ncommunity discovery, we argue that feature learning with random node\nattributes, using graph neural networks, can be more effective. To this end, we\npropose to use attention models for effective feature learning, and develop two\nnovel architectures, GrAMME-SG and GrAMME-Fusion, that exploit the inter-layer\ndependencies for building multi-layered graph embeddings. Using empirical\nstudies on several benchmark datasets, we evaluate the proposed approaches and\ndemonstrate significant performance improvements in comparison to\nstate-of-the-art network embedding strategies.

We find that stellar winds and ionised gas are the main\ndrivers of HII region expansion in our sample, while the direct radiation\npressure is up to three orders of magnitude lower than the other terms. We\nrelate the total pressure to the star formation rate per unit area,\n$\\Sigma_{SFR}$, for each region and find that stellar feedback has a negative\neffect on star formation, and sets an upper limit to $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ as a\nfunction of increasing pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 18:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The relativistic (quasiparticle) time blocking\napproximation (R(Q)TBA) has successfully provided a good description of the\nlow-energy strength, in particular, the strength associated with pygmy dipole\nresonance, describing transitions from and to the nuclear ground state. The\nfinite-temperature generalization of this method is designed for thermally\nexcited compound nuclei and has the potential to enrich the fine structure of\nthe dipole strength, especially in the low-energy region. The\nfinite-temperature RTBA equations are derived using the Matsubara Green's\nfunction formalism.

The approach is\nimplemented self-consistently in the framework of quantum hadrodynamics and\nkeeps the ability of connecting the high-energy scale of heavy mesons and the\nlow-energy domain of nuclear medium polarization effects in a parameter-free\nway. The presented calculations of the dipole response within a self-consistent\nrelativistic framework reveal that, although the Landau damping plays the\nleading role in the temperature evolution of the strength distribution, (i) at\nmoderate temperatures the PVC effects remain almost as strong as at $T=0$ and\n(ii) at high temperatures they are tremendously reinforced because of the\nformation of the new collective low-energy modes.

Achieving competitive constraints on these parameters\nrequires high signal-to-noise extraction of the projected gravitational\npotential from the CMB maps. Standard methods for reconstructing the lensing\npotential employ the quadratic estimator (QE). However, the QE performs\nsuboptimally at the low noise levels expected in upcoming experiments. Other\nmethods, like maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), are under active\ndevelopment. In this work, we demonstrate reconstruction of the CMB lensing\npotential with deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) - ie, a ResUNet. The\nnetwork is trained and tested on simulated data, and otherwise has no physical\nparametrization related to the physical processes of the CMB and gravitational\nlensing. We show that, over a wide range of angular scales, ResUNets recover\nthe input gravitational potential with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the\nQE method, reaching levels comparable to analytic approximations of MLE\nmethods. We demonstrate that the network outputs quantifiably different lensing\nmaps when given input CMB maps generated with different cosmologies. We also\nshow we can use the reconstructed lensing map for cosmological parameter\nestimation. This application of CNN provides a few innovations at the\nintersection of cosmology and machine learning. First, while training and\nregressing on images, we predict a continuous-variable field rather than\ndiscrete classes. Second, we are able to establish uncertainty measures for the\nnetwork output that are analogous to standard methods.

A possibility of using the\namplitude and phase of magnons for sending signals via electrical insulators\ncreates conditions for avoiding Ohmic losses, and achieving ultra-low power\ndissipation. Most of the envisioned magnonic logic devices are based on spin\nwave interference, where the minimum energy per operation is limited by the\nnoise level.

As opposed to 4G base stations, which could\nafford highly linear PAs, next-generation base stations will need to use\ninexpensive PAs, which have a limited region of linear amplification. One of\nthe research challenges is effectively handling signals which have high\npeak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs), such as orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM). This paper introduces a PAPR-aware precoding scheme that\nexploits the excessive spatial degrees-of-freedom of large scale multiple-input\nmultipleoutput (MIMO) antenna systems. This typically requires finding a\nsolution to a nonconvex optimization problem. Instead of relaxing the problem\nto minimize the peak power, we introduce a practical semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR) framework that enables accurately and efficiently approximating the\ntheoretical PAPR-aware precoding performance for OFDM-based massive MIMO\nsystems. The framework allows incorporating channel uncertainties and intercell\ncoordination. Numerical results show that several orders of magnitude\nimprovements can be achieved w.r.t. state of the art techniques, such as\ninstantaneous power consumption reduction and multiuser interference\ncancellation. The proposed PAPRaware precoding can be effectively handled along\nwith the multicell signal processing by the centralized baseband processing\nplatforms of next-generation radio access networks. Performance can be traded\nfor the computing efficiency for other platforms\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2018 21:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

Comparing the RC mean magnitude\nacross three fields at projected distances of 21, 52 and 80 kpc from M31, we\nfind a line of sight distance gradient identical to recent literature\nmeasurements in fields along the core.

Due to the dynamic and\nrapidly evolving nature of large-scale networks, like online social networks,\nthe notion of stronger local and global interactions among the nodes in\ncommunities has become harder to capture. In this paper, we present a novel\ngraphical inference method - GI-OHMS (Graphical Inference in Observed-Hidden\nvariable Merged Seeded network) to solve the problem of overlapping community\ndetection. The novelty of our approach is in transforming the complex and dense\nnetwork of interest into an observed-hidden merged seeded(OHMS) network, which\npreserves the important community properties of the network. We further utilize\na graphical inference method (Bayesian Markov Random Field) to extract\ncommunities. The superiority of our approach lies in two main observations: 1)\nThe extracted OHMS network excludes many weaker connections, thus leading to a\nhigher accuracy of inference 2) The graphical inference step operates on a\nsmaller network, thus having much lower execution time.

However, retrieving\nentertainment contents at the Data Center (DC) can hinder content delivery\nservice due to high delay of car-to-DC communication. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, by\nusing Deep Learning approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing\n(MEC) structure. First, at DC, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predict\nthe probabilities of contents to be requested in specific areas. To reduce the\ncar-DC delay, MLP outputs are logged into MEC servers attached to roadside\nunits. Second, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for car\npassengers' features such as age and gender, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nis used to predict age and gender of passengers. Third, each car requests MLP\noutput from MEC server and compares its CNN and MLP outputs by using k-means\nand binary classification. Through this, the self-driving car can identify the\ncontents need to be downloaded from the MEC server and cached. Finally, we\nformulate deep learning based caching in the self-driving car that enhances\nentertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize\ncontent downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a Block Successive\nMajorization-Minimization (BS-MM) technique is applied. The simulation results\nshow that the accuracy of our prediction for the contents need to be cached in\nthe areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04% and our approach can\nminimize delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 00:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 17:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

Locks that have a compact memory representation\nfor active readers will typically suffer under high intensity read-dominated\nworkloads when the \"reader indicator\"' state is updated frequently by a diverse\nset of threads, causing cache invalidation and coherence traffic. Other\ndesigns, such as cohort reader-writer locks, use distributed reader indicators,\none per NUMA node. This improves reader-reader scalability, but also increases\nthe size of each lock instance. We propose a simple transformation BRAVO, that\naugments any existing reader-writer lock, adding just two integer fields to the\nlock instance. Readers make their presence known to writers by hashing their\nthread's identity with the lock address, forming an index into a visible\nreaders table. Readers attempt to install the lock address into that element in\nthe table, making their existence known to potential writers. All locks and\nthreads in an address space can share the visible readers table. Updates by\nreaders tend to be diffused over the table, resulting in a NUMA-friendly\ndesign. Crucially, readers of the same lock tend to write to different\nlocations in the array, reducing coherence traffic. Specifically, BRAVO allows\na simple compact lock to be augmented so as to provide scalable concurrent\nreading but with only a modest increase in footprint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 00:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 22:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 15:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

The basic phenomenology of disproportionation involves the\nabsence of B-atom charge ordering, the creation of different B-X bond length\nfor different local environments, the appearance of metal (in SLE) to insulator\n(in DLE) transition, and the formation of ligand holes. We point out that this\nphenomenology is common to a broad range of chemical bonding patterns in ABX3\ncompounds, either with s-p electron B-metal cations (BaBiO3, CsTlF3), or noble\nmetal cation (CsAuCl3), as well as d-electron cations (SmNiO3, CaFeO3). We show\nthat underlying much of this phenomenology is the self-regulating response,\nwhereby in strongly bonded metal-ligand systems with high lying ligand\norbitals, the system protects itself from creating highly charged cations by\ntransferring ligand electrons to the metal, thus preserving a nearly constant\nmetal charge in DLE, while creating B-ligand bond alternation and ligand-like\nconduction band (ligand hole). We are asking what are the minimal theory\ningredients needed to explain the main features of this SLE-to-DLE\nphenomenology, such as its energetic driving force, bond length changes,\npossible modifications in charge density and density of state changes. Using as\na guide the lowering of the total energy in DLE relative to SLE, we show that\ndensity functional calculations describe this phenomenology across the whole\nchemical bonding range without resort to special strong correlation effects,\nbeyond what DFT naturally contains. In particular, lower total energy\nconfigurations (DLE) naturally develop bond alternation, gaping of the metallic\nSLE state, and absence of charge ordering with ligand hole formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 02:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

The particle-particle entanglement, between all degrees of\nfreedom of one particle and all degrees of freedom of the other particle, is\ninvariant under boosts if each particle has a definite momentum, although the\nspin-spin entanglement is degraded for high speed boosts. Correspondingly, the\nmean negativities are not invariant since the boost drives changes into\ncorrelations encoded in specific bipartitions.

Arriving threads\natomically fetch-and-increment ticket and then wait for grant to become equal\nto the value returned by the fetch-and-increment primitive, at which point the\nthread holds the lock. The corresponding unlock operation simply increments\ngrant. This simple design has short code paths and fast handover (transfer of\nownership) under light contention, but may suffer degraded scalability under\nhigh contention when multiple threads busy wait on the grant field -- so-called\nglobal spinning. We propose a variation on ticket locks where long-term waiting\nthreads wait on locations in a waiting array instead of busy waiting on the\ngrant field. The single waiting array is shared among all locks. Short-term\nwaiting is accomplished in the usual manner on the grant field. The resulting\nalgorithm, TWA, improves on ticket locks by limiting the number of threads\nspinning on the grant field at any given time, reducing the number of remote\ncaches requiring invalidation from the store that releases the lock. In turn,\nthis accelerates handover, and since the lock is held throughout the handover\noperation, scalability improves. Under light or no contention, TWA yields\nperformance comparable to the classic ticket lock, avoiding the complexity and\nextra accesses incurred by MCS locks in the handover path, but providing\nperformance above or beyond that of MCS at high contention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 03:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 22:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 22:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 21:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

In this paper, we propose a novel three-level upscaling method\nfor flow problems in fractured porous media. Our method starts with a fine grid\ndiscretization for the system involving fractured porous media. In the next\nstep, based on the fine grid model, we construct a nonlocal multi-continua\nupscaling (NLMC) method using an intermediate grid.

In a nutshell, HOLMES aims to produce a detection signal that indicates\nthe presence of a coordinated set of activities that are part of an APT\ncampaign. One of the main challenges addressed by our approach involves\ndeveloping a suite of techniques that make the detection signal robust and\nreliable. At a high-level, the techniques we develop effectively leverage the\ncorrelation between suspicious information flows that arise during an attacker\ncampaign. In addition to its detection capability, HOLMES is also able to\ngenerate a high-level graph that summarizes the attacker's actions in\nreal-time. This graph can be used by an analyst for an effective cyber\nresponse. An evaluation of our approach against some real-world APTs indicates\nthat HOLMES can detect APT campaigns with high precision and low false alarm\nrate.

With a SFR of 991 Msun/yr, this\nstarburst event should occur closer to final coalescence, as usually seen in\nhydrodynamical simulations. From the CO size, inclination, and velocity profile\nfor both disks, the dynamical mass is calculated through a novel method that\nincorporates a calibration using simulations of galaxy mergers. Based on the\ndynamical mass, we measure (1) the molecular gas mass, independent from the CO\nluminosity, (2) the ratio of the total gas mass and the CO(1 - 0) luminosity\n(alpha_CO = M_gas/L'_CO(1-0)), and (3) the gas-to-dust ratio, with the latter\ntwo being lower than typically assumed. We find that the high star formation,\ntriggered in both galaxies, is caused by a set of optimal conditions: a high\ngas mass/fraction, a short depletion time (t_depl=85 and 67 Myrs) to convert\ngas into stars, and the interaction of likely counter-rotating molecular disks\nthat may accelerate the loss of angular momentum. The state of interaction is\nfurther established by the detection of diffuse CO and continuum emission,\ntidal debris that bridges the two nuclei and is associated with stellar\nemission seen by HST/WFC3.

The existence of a SAGE decomposition is a sufficient\ncondition for nonnegativity of a signomial, and it can be verified by solving a\ntractable convex relative entropy program. We present new structural properties\nof SAGE certificates such as a characterization of the extreme rays of the\ncones associated to these decompositions as well as an appealing form of\nsparsity preservation. These lead to a number of important consequences such as\nconditions under which signomial nonnegativity is equivalent to the existence\nof a SAGE decomposition; our results represent the broadest-known class of\nnonconvex signomial optimization problems that can be solved efficiently via\nconvex relaxation. The analysis in this paper proceeds by leveraging the\ninteraction between the convex duality underlying SAGE certificates and the\nface structure of Newton polytopes.

On the\nother hand, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides an appropriate infrastructure\nto offload latency-sensitive tasks. However, the amount of resources in MEC\nservers is typically limited. Therefore, it is important to intelligently\nmanage the MEC task offloading by optimizing the backhaul bandwidth and edge\nserver resource allocation in order to decrease the overall latency of the\noffloaded tasks. This paper investigates the task allocation problem in MEC\nenvironment, where the mmWave technology is used in the backhaul network. We\nformulate a Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) problem with the goal\nto minimize the total task serving time. Its objective is to determine an\noptimized network topology, identify which server is used to process a given\noffloaded task, find the path of each user task, and determine the allocated\nbandwidth to each task on mmWave backhaul links. Because the problem is\ndifficult to solve, we develop a two-step approach. First, a Mixed Integer\nLinear Program (MILP) determining the network topology and the routing paths is\noptimally solved. Then, the fractions of bandwidth allocated to each user task\nare optimized by solving a quasi-convex problem. Numerical results illustrate\nthe obtained topology and routing paths for selected scenarios and show that\noptimizing the bandwidth allocation significantly improves the total serving\ntime, particularly for bandwidth-intensive tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 08:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

Dust continuum emission provides a potential\nalternative assuming a known dust/gas ratio, but this must be calibrated on a\ndirect gas tracer at z$\\geq$1. In this paper we consider the [CI] 492-GHz\nemission line, which has been shown to trace molecular gas closely throughout\nGalactic clouds and has the advantages of being optically thin in typical\nconditions (unlike CO), and being observable at accessible frequencies at high\nredshifts (in contrast to the low-excitation lines of CO).

We find that\nonce the self-gravitating gas cloud host is sufficiently well re- solved,\naccretion onto the BH is driven by the cloud internal structure, independently\nof the BH seed mass, provided dynamical friction is present during the early\nstages of cloud collapse.

As such, the magnetic\nstructure of barlowite resembles that of the related material clinoatacamite,\nCu$_{4}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$, the parent compound of the well-known quantum spin\nliquid candidate hebertsmithite, ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 10:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

By assessing the stellar absorption, we derive the effective\ntemperature, surface gravity, and photospheric abundances. For the first time,\nwe report time variability of the central star's radial velocity, strongly\nindicating a binary central star. Comparison between the derived elemental\nabundances and those predicted values by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star\nnucleosynthesis models indicates that the progenitor is a star with initial\nmass of ~1.25 Msun and metallicity Z = 0.001/alpha-element/Cl-rich\n([alpha,Cl/Fe] ~ +0.3-0.4). We determine the distance (11.33 kpc) to be\nconsistent with the post-AGB evolution of 1.25 Msun initial mass stars with Z =\n0.001. Using the photoionisation model, we fully reproduce the derived\nquantities by adopting a cylindrically shaped nebula.

Both types of spatial\ndiscretizations are coupled with second order semi-implicit leap-frog and\nimplicit trapezoidal temporal schemes studied in our previous research [5,6].\nBy performing detailed dispersion analysis for the semi-discrete and fully\ndiscrete schemes, we obtain rigorous quantification of the dispersion error for\nLorentz dispersive dielectrics. In particular, comparisons of dispersion error\ncan be made taking into account the model parameters, and mesh sizes in the\ndesign of the two types of schemes. The results for the numerical dispersion\nanalysis can guide us in the optimal choice of discretization parameters for\nthe more complicated and nonlinear models. The numerical dispersion analysis of\nthe fully discrete FD and DG schemes, for the dispersive Maxwell model\nconsidered in this paper, clearly indicate the dependence of the numerical\ndispersion errors on spatial and temporal discretizations, their order of\naccuracy, mesh discretization parameters and model parameters.

Barium (Ba) stars are dwarf and giant stars enriched in elements\nheavier than iron produced by the slow neutron-capture process (s process).\nThey belong to binary systems where the primary star evolved through the\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase,during which it produced the s-process\nelements and transferred them onto the secondary, now observed as a Ba star.\nAims. We compare the largest homogeneous set of Ba giant star observations of\nthe s-process elements Y, Zr, La, Ce, and Nd with AGB nucleosynthesis models to\nreach a better understanding of the s process in AGB stars. Methods. By\nconsidering the light-s (ls: Y and Zr) heavy-s (hs: La, Ce, and Nd) and\nelements individually, we computed for the first time quantitative error bars\nfor the different hs-element/ls-element abundance ratios, and for each of the\nsample stars. We compared these ratios to low-mass AGB nucleosynthesis models.\nWe excluded La from our analysis because the strong La lines in some of the\nsample stars cause an overestimation and unreliable abundance determination, as\ncompared to the other observed hs-type elements. Results. All the computed\nhs-type to ls-type element ratios show a clear trend of increasing with\ndecreasing metallicity with a small spread (less than a factor of 3). This\ntrend is predicted by low-mass AGB models where 13C is the main neutron source.\nThe comparison with rotating AGB models indicates the need for the presence of\nan angular momentum transport mechanism that should not transport chemical\nspecies, but significantly reduce the rotational speed of the core in the\nadvanced stellar evolutionary stages.

On the other hand, the observed radial\nspread out structure known as Finger of God (FoG) is attributed to non-linear\neffects, like virial relaxation or random motions in the inner regions of\ngalaxy clusters, or non-linear terms in collapse theory. In this paper we argue\nthat the squashed structure associated with the redshift-space ($s-$) linear\ntheory 2PCF is obtained only when this function is displayed in real-space\n($r-$), or when the mapping from $r-$ to $s-$space is trivialized by one of a\nseries of approximations: the \"wide separation\" sometimes mistaken by the\n\"distant observer\", the $\\mu(r) \\sim \\mu(s)$ in the cosine of the position\nvector with the LoS, or plainly by approximating $s \\sim r$. To display the\n$s-$space 2PCF properly in a grid in $s-$space requires one to solve for the\nmapping function $\\bm s(\\bm r)$ and its inverse, which exists in the small\ngravitational disturbance case. We find this mapping by using plane of the sky\nprojections of the $r-$ and $s-$ 2PCFs in the simplest case of the linear\nKaiser spectrum with a conservative power-law $r-$space 2PCF. We show that even\nin this simple case, a structure quite similar to the FoG is observed in the\nsmall scale region, while in the large scale the expected squashed structure is\nobtained. We show that the observed structure is a function of three\nparameters: the dimensionless growth rate for visible matter ($\\beta$), the\npower-law exponent ($\\gamma$) and the cosmological distortion given by the\nAlcock-Paczy{\\'n}ski parameter ($AP$). We conclude that there appears to be the\nway of discerning between cosmological and gravitational redshift distortions\navoiding known degeneracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 15:43:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 16:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

System operators often choose to\nreposition these shared vehicles (such as bikes, cars, or scooters) actively\nduring the course of the day to improve service rate. They face a complex\ndynamic optimization problem in which many integer-valued decisions must be\nmade, using real-time state and forecast information, and within the tight\ncomputation time constraints inherent to real-time decision-making. We first\npresent a novel nested-flow formulation of the problem, and demonstrate that\nits linear relaxation is significantly tighter than one from existing\nliterature.

In order to develop truly autonomous robots, we must step away from\nthis intuition and let robotic agents develop their own way of perceiving. The\nrobot should start from scratch and gradually develop perceptual notions, under\nno prior assumptions, exclusively by looking into its sensorimotor experience\nand identifying repetitive patterns and invariants. One of the most fundamental\nperceptual notions, space, cannot be an exception to this requirement. In this\npaper we look into the prerequisites for the emergence of simplified spatial\nnotions on the basis of a robot's sensorimotor flow. We show that the notion of\nspace as environment-independent cannot be deduced solely from exteroceptive\ninformation, which is highly variable and is mainly determined by the contents\nof the environment. The environment-independent definition of space can be\napproached by looking into the functions that link the motor commands to\nchanges in exteroceptive inputs. In a sufficiently rich environment, the\nkernels of these functions correspond uniquely to the spatial configuration of\nthe agent's exteroceptors. We simulate a redundant robotic arm with a retina\ninstalled at its end-point and show how this agent can learn the configuration\nspace of its retina. The resulting manifold has the topology of the Cartesian\nproduct of a plane and a circle, and corresponds to the planar position and\norientation of the retina.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 13:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

The general problem under investigation\nis the probability of occurrence of chance fluctuations. A quantitative answer\nis necessary to determine whether detected fluctuations are a real\n(astronomical, in this case) signal, or if they can be attributed to chance.\nThis application note provides a new comprehensive method to answer this\nquestion as function of the instrument's resolution, the wavelength coverage of\nthe spectrum, the number of fluctuations of interest, and the confidence level\nchosen. The method is based on the binomial distribution, and addresses also\nthe probability of multiple simultaneous fluctuations. A critical aspect of the\nmodel is the a priori knowledge of the location of possible fluctuations, which\nsignificantly affects the probability of detection. In fact, a wider wavelength\nrange for the 'blind' search of possible fluctuations results in a larger\nnumber of 'tries' for the detection of a fluctuation, lowering the overall\nsignificance of a specific feature.

Magnetic defects have been modeled as local\nvariations in the material parameters, such as the exchange stiffness,\nsaturation magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy and\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya constant. We observe both pinning (potential well) and\nscattering (potential barrier) traps when tuning either a local increase or a\nlocal reduction for each one of these magnetic properties. It is found that the\nskyrmion-defect aspect ratio is a crucial parameter to build traps for\nskyrmions. In particular, the efficiency of the trap is compromised if the\ndefect size is smaller than the skyrmion size, because they interact weakly. On\nthe other hand, if the defect size is larger than the skyrmion diameter, the\nskyrmion-defect interaction becomes evident. Thus, the strength of the\nskyrmion-defect interaction can be tuned by the modification of the magnetic\nproperties within a region with suitable size. Furthermore, the basic physics\nbehind the mechanisms for pinning and for scattering is discussed. In\nparticular, we discover that skyrmions move towards the magnetic region which\ntends to maximize its diameter; it enables the magnetic system to minimize its\nenergy.

The deep decoder has a\nsimple architecture with no convolutions and fewer weight parameters than the\noutput dimensionality. This underparameterization enables the deep decoder to\ncompress images into a concise set of network weights, which we show is on par\nwith wavelet-based thresholding.

To coordinate the transmission of multiple secondary transmitters, the\nsecondary gateway needs to schedule the backscattering time, energy harvesting\ntime, and transmission time among them. However, under the dynamics of the\nprimary channel and the uncertainty of the energy state of the secondary\ntransmitters, it is challenging for the gateway to find a time scheduling\nmechanism which maximizes the total throughput. In this paper, we propose to\nuse the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive an optimal time\nscheduling policy for the gateway. Specifically, to deal with the problem with\nlarge state and action spaces, we adopt a Double Deep-Q Network (DDQN) that\nenables the gateway to learn the optimal policy. The simulation results clearly\nshow that the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm outperforms\nnon-learning schemes in terms of network throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 05:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

Also, a new technique which consists in laying down an elastomer\nmembrane, coated with an aluminum film, on the ferrofluid is discussed. By\nadding the membrane on the ferrofluid, it further decreases the time response\nby a factor of 2. Furthermore, the thin aluminum layer improves the\nreflectivity of the mirror. Finally, using the membrane and the overdrive\ntechniques combined, the time response is improved by a factor of 20.
