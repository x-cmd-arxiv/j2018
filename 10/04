Radial velocities are computed from high signal-to-noise spectra by\nuse of a cross-correlation method. The radial-velocity curves are fitted by\nusing both a least-squares algorithm and a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm. We\nuse a Monte Carlo method to compute uncertainties on the orbital elements.

As a result, we derive\nand update orbital elements for 33 galactic post-AGB binaries, among which 3\nare new orbits. The orbital periods of the systems range from 100 to about 3000\ndays. Over 70 percent (23 out of 33) of our binaries have significant non-zero\neccentricities ranging over all periods. Their orbits are non-circular despite\nthe fact that the Roche-lobe radii are smaller than the maximum size of a\ntypical AGB star and tidal circularisation should have been strong when the\nobjects were on the AGB.

However, these readings can leak\nsensitive information about consumers' activities. Various privacy-preserving\nschemes for collecting fine-grained readings have been proposed for AMI\nnetworks. These schemes aggregate individual readings and send an aggregated\nreading to the utility, but they extensively use asymmetric-key cryptography\nwhich involves large computation/communication overhead. Furthermore, they do\nnot address End-to-End (E2E) data integrity, authenticity, and computing\nelectricity bills based on dynamic prices. In this paper, we propose EPIC, an\nefficient and privacy-preserving data collection scheme with E2E data integrity\nverification for AMI networks. Using efficient cryptographic operations, each\nmeter should send a masked reading to the utility such that all the masks are\ncanceled after aggregating all meters' masked readings, and thus the utility\ncan only obtain an aggregated reading to preserve consumers' privacy. The\nutility can verify the aggregated reading integrity without accessing the\nindividual readings to preserve privacy. It can also identify the attackers and\ncompute electricity bills efficiently by using the fine-grained readings\nwithout violating privacy. Furthermore, EPIC can resist collusion attacks in\nwhich the utility colludes with a relay node to extract the meters' readings. A\nformal proof, probabilistic analysis are used to evaluate the security of EPIC,\nand ns-3 is used to implement EPIC and evaluate the network performance. In\naddition, we compare EPIC to existing data collection schemes in terms of\noverhead and security/privacy features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 17:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

This method uses the phase angle of the spiral structure in\nseveral wavebands, and looks for a crossing between the blue (B) light and the\nredder wavebands (e.g., R or I). For NGC 613, we find two phase crossings, an\nouter phase crossing at 136 +/- 8 arcsec and an inner phase crossing at 16 +/-\n8 arcsec. We argue that the outer phase crossing is due to the bar corotation\nradius, and from the bar length of $R_{\\rm bar}=90.0\\pm4.0$ arcsec we go on to\ncalculate a relative bar pattern speed of R = 1.5 +/- 0.1, which is consistent\nwith the results of previous methods described in the literature. For a better\nunderstanding of the inner phase crossing, we have created structure maps in\nall four wavebands and a B-R color map. All of our structure maps and our color\nmap highlight a nuclear ring of star formation at a radius of ~4 arcsec, which\nhad also been observed recently using ALMA. Furthermore, the radius of our\ninner phase crossing appears to be consistent with the size of a nuclear disk\nof star formation that has been recently detected and described in the\nliterature.

Recently, this\nimportant problem was shown to be undecidable for quantum spin systems in two\n(or more) spatial dimensions: there exists no algorithm that determines in\ngeneral whether a system is gapped or gapless, a result which has many\nunexpected consequences for the physics of such systems. However, there are\nmany indications that one dimensional spin systems are simpler than their\nhigher-dimensional counterparts: for example, they cannot have thermal phase\ntransitions or topological order, and there exist highly-effective numerical\nalgorithms such as DMRG - and even provably polynomial-time ones - for gapped\n1D systems, exploiting the fact that such systems obey an entropy area-law.\nFurthermore, the spectral gap undecidability construction crucially relied on\naperiodic tilings, which are not possible in 1D.\n  So does the spectral gap problem become decidable in 1D?

Such rules -- as formulated by Onsager, Lifshitz and\nRoth -- apply when the spin-orbit interaction dominates over the Zeeman\ninteraction (or vice versa), but does not generally apply when the two\ninteractions are comparable in strength. In this work, we present a generalized\nquantization rule which treats the spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions on equal\nfooting, and therefore has wider applicability to spin-orbit-coupled materials\nlacking a spatial inversion center, or having magnetic order. More generally,\nour rule describes the Landau quantization of any number of nearly degenerate\nenergy bands -- in any symmetry class. The resultant Landau-level spectrum is\ngenerically non-equidistant but may contain spin (or pseudospin) degeneracies.\nTo tune to such degeneracies in the absence of crystalline point-group\nsymmetries, three real parameters are needed. We have exhaustively identified\nall symmetry classes of cyclotron orbits for which this number is reduced from\nthree, thus establishing symmetry-enforced 'non-crossing rules' for Landau\nlevels. In particular, only one parameter is needed in the presence of spatial\nrotation or inversion; this single parameter may be the magnitude or\norientation of the field. Signatures of single-parameter tunability include (i)\na smooth crossover between period-doubled and -undoubled quantum oscillations\nin the low-temperature Shubnikov-de Haas effect, as well as (ii) 'magic-angle'\nmagnetoresistance oscillations.

One\nsuch example is the often reported occurrence of stable planar faults (PFs) in\nbody-centered cubic (bcc) metals subjected to high strains, e.g., at crack tips\nor in strained nano-objects. In this paper, we study the strain dependence of\nthe generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) of {110} planes in various bcc\nmetals with material models of increasing sophistication, i.e., (modified)\nembedded atom method, angular-dependent, Tersoff, and bond-order potentials as\nwell as density functional theory.

These PFs do not appear when more\nsophisticated material models are used and have thus to be regarded as\nartifacts of the potentials. We demonstrate that the local GSFE minimum is not\nformed for reasons of symmetry and we recommend including the determination of\nthe strain-dependent (110) GSFE as a benchmark for newly developed potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 20:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

A prime example are\ngeneralized additive models where splines (say) are used to approximate\nnon-linear functional components in conjunction with a quadratic penalty to\ncontrol for overfitting. Estimation and inference are then generally performed\nbased on the penalized likelihood, or under a mixed model framework. The\npenalized likelihood framework is fast but potentially unstable, and choosing\nthe smoothing parameters needs to be done externally using cross-validation,\nfor instance. The mixed model framework tends to be more stable and offers a\nnatural way for choosing the smoothing parameters, but for non-normal responses\ninvolves an intractable integral.\n  In this article, we introduce a new framework for semiparametric regression\nbased on variational approximations. The approach possesses the stability and\nnatural inference tools of the mixed model framework, while achieving\ncomputation times comparable to using penalized likelihood. Focusing on\ngeneralized additive models, we derive fully tractable variational likelihoods\nfor some common response types. We present several features of the variational\napproximation framework for inference, including a variational information\nmatrix for inference on parametric components, and a closed-form update for\nestimating the smoothing parameter. We demonstrate the consistency of the\nvariational approximation estimates, and an asymptotic normality result for the\nparametric component of the model. Simulation studies show the variational\napproximation framework performs similarly to and sometimes better than\ncurrently available software for fitting generalized additive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 20:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

In all surveys,\nsurveyors were pre-assigned to households based on an initial household\nlisting. We compare responses given to male and female surveyors across three\ndomains: household characteristics, child mortality and reproductive health.\nMultivariable regression with enumeration area fixed-effects were used to\nestimate response differentials.\n  A total of 22,835 household surveys were analyzed. The proportion of\ninterviews conducted by female interviews varied between 9 percent in Central\nAfrican Republic and 52 percent in Cameroon. Female surveyor gender increased\nthe odds of reporting asset ownership by 9.4% (OR 1.094, 95% CI: 1.024,1.169)\nand increased the odds of reporting a pregnancy-related event by 25% (OR 1.246\n(95% CI: 1.12,1.393). Being interviewed by a woman increased the odds of\nrespondents reporting a stillbirth by 29% (95% CI: 1.118,1.492), and the odds\nof reporting a miscarriage by 17% (95% CI: 1.072,1.284). Substantial\nheterogeneity in gender-specific reporting was found across the four countries.\nWe did not find evidence that the gender of the participant modified the effect\nof surveyor gender for household items.\n  Our results suggest that surveyor gender is highly predictive of survey\nresponses. For health surveys, female surveyors are likely to receive more\naccurate and consistent responses. More generally, social distance between\ninterviewers and interviewees should be minimized in large scale surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 21:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

Cell extrusions occur during apoptosis,\nepithelial-mesenchymal transition, or pre-cancerous cell invasion. They play\nimportant roles in embryogenesis, homeostasis, carcinogenesis, and many other\nbiological processes. Although many of the molecular factors involved in cell\nextrusion are known, little is known about the mechanical basis of cell\nextrusion. We used a three-dimensional (3D) vertex model to investigate the\nmechanical stability of cells arranged in a monolayer with 3D foam geometry. We\nfound that when the cells composing the monolayer have homogeneous mechanical\nproperties, cells are extruded from the monolayer when the symmetry of the 3D\ngeometry is broken due to an increase in cell density or a decrease in the\nnumber of topological neighbors around single cells. Those results suggest that\nmechanical instability inherent in the 3D foam geometry of epithelial\nmonolayers is sufficient to drive epithelial cell extrusion. In the situation\nwhere cells in the monolayer actively generate contractile or adhesive forces\nunder the control of intrinsic genetic programs, the forces act to break the\nsymmetry of the monolayer, leading to cell extrusion that is directed to the\napical or basal side of the monolayer by the balance of contractile and\nadhesive forces on the apical and basal sides. Although our analyses are based\non a simple mechanical model, our results are in accordance with observations\nof epithelial monolayers {\\it in vivo} and consistently explain cell extrusions\nunder a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

However, the\nfocus has mainly been on low-contention workloads. Modern transactional systems\nperform poorly on workloads with transactions accessing a few highly contended\ndata items. We observe that most transactional workloads, including those with\nhigh contention, can be divided into clusters of data conflict-free\ntransactions and a small set of residuals. In this paper, we introduce a new\nconcurrency control protocol called Strife that leverages the above\nobservation. Strife executes transactions in batches, where each batch is\npartitioned into clusters of conflict-free transactions and a small set of\nresidual transactions. The conflict-free clusters are executed in parallel\nwithout any concurrency control, followed by executing the residual cluster\neither serially or with concurrency control.

We study the feasibility\nof achieving various fairness properties by post-processing calibrated scores,\nand then show that deferring post-processors allow for more fairness conditions\nto hold on the final decision. Specifically, we show:\n  1. There does not exist a general way to post-process a calibrated classifier\nto equalize protected groups' positive or negative predictive value (PPV or\nNPV). For certain \"nice\" calibrated classifiers, either PPV or NPV can be\nequalized when the post-processor uses different thresholds across protected\ngroups, though there exist distributions of calibrated scores for which the two\nmeasures cannot be both equalized. When the post-processing consists of a\nsingle global threshold across all groups, natural fairness properties, such as\nequalizing PPV in a nontrivial way, do not hold even for \"nice\" classifiers.\n  2. When the post-processing is allowed to `defer' on some decisions (that is,\nto avoid making a decision by handing off some examples to a separate process),\nthen for the non-deferred decisions, the resulting classifier can be made to\nequalize PPV, NPV, false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR)\nacross the protected groups.

This means\nthat an infected system may attempt to access many domains in an attempt to\ncontact the command and control server. Therefore, the automatic detection of\nDGA domains is an important task, both for the sake of blocking malicious\ndomains and identifying compromised hosts. However, many DGAs use English\nwordlists to generate plausibly clean-looking domain names; this makes\nautomatic detection difficult. In this work, we devise a notion of difficulty\nfor DGA families called the smashword score; this measures how much a DGA\nfamily looks like English words. We find that this measure accurately reflects\nhow much a DGA family's domains look like they are made from natural English\nwords.

Synthesizing realistic 3D mesh animation\nsequences is a challenging and important task in computer animation. To achieve\nthis, researchers have long been focusing on shape analysis to develop new\ninterpolation and extrapolation techniques. However, such techniques have\nlimited learning capabilities and therefore can produce unrealistic animation.\nDeep architectures that operate directly on mesh sequences remain unexplored,\ndue to the following major barriers: meshes with irregular triangles, sequences\ncontaining rich temporal information and flexible deformations. To address\nthese, we utilize convolutional neural networks defined on triangular meshes\nalong with a shape deformation representation to extract useful features,\nfollowed by LSTM cells that iteratively process the features. To allow\ncompletion of a missing mesh sequence from given endpoints, we propose a new\nweight-shared bidirectional structure. The bidirectional generation loss also\nhelps mitigate error accumulation over iterations. Benefiting from all these\ntechnical advances, our approach outperforms existing methods in sequence\nprediction and completion both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, a large amount of computation redundancy still\nexists in BNN inference. By analyzing local properties of images and the\nlearned BNN kernel weights, we observe an average of $\\sim$78% input similarity\nand $\\sim$59% weight similarity among weight kernels, measured by our proposed\nmetric in common network architectures. Thus there does exist redundancy that\ncan be exploited to further reduce the amount of on-chip computations.\n  Motivated by the observation, in this paper, we proposed two types of fast\nand energy-efficient architectures for BNN inference. We also provide analysis\nand insights to pick the better strategy of these two for different datasets\nand network models. By reusing the results from previous computation, much\ncycles for data buffer access and computations can be skipped. By experiments,\nwe demonstrate that 80% of the computation and 40% of the buffer access can be\nskipped by exploiting BNN similarity. Thus, our design can achieve 17%\nreduction in total power consumption, 54% reduction in on-chip power\nconsumption and 2.4$\\times$ maximum speedup, compared to the baseline without\napplying our reuse technique.

Though image object detectors have\nshown rapid progress in recent years with the release of multiple large-scale\nstatic image datasets, object detection on videos still remains an open problem\ndue to scarcity of annotated video frames. Having a robust video object\ndetector is an essential component for video understanding and curating\nlarge-scale automated annotations in videos. Domain difference between images\nand videos makes the transferability of image object detectors to videos\nsub-optimal. The most common solution is to use weakly supervised annotations\nwhere a video frame has to be tagged for presence/absence of object categories.\nThis still takes up manual effort. In this paper we take a step forward by\nadapting the concept of unsupervised adversarial image-to-image translation to\nperturb static high quality images to be visually indistinguishable from a set\nof video frames. We assume the presence of a fully annotated static image\ndataset and an unannotated video dataset. Object detector is trained on\nadversarially transformed image dataset using the annotations of the original\ndataset. Experiments on Youtube-Objects and Youtube-Objects-Subset datasets\nwith two contemporary baseline object detectors reveal that such unsupervised\npixel level domain adaptation boosts the generalization performance on video\nframes compared to direct application of original image object detector.

Despite efficiencies of both perovskite SCs and LEDs are already among\nthe best, the development of a perovskite dual functional device that is\ncapable of working in these two regimes with high efficiencies is still\nchallenging. Here we demonstrate that the dual functional device based on mixed\nhalide perovskite CH3NH3PbBr2I can be switched from SC to LED with low\nthreshold voltage Vth < 2 V by exposing to Sun at open circuit Voc or at small\nbias voltage of Vpol ~ 1 - 2 V.

We show that before the photo-poling, the\nelectroluminescence (EL) is highly unstable in LED regime, whereas after the\nphoto-poling, stabilized EL exhibits unusual dynamics, increasing with time and\npoling cycle number, while Vth and injection current decrease with cycling\nruns. Additionally, photo-induced and current-induced halide segregation\naccumulates with cycling, that is found beneficial for LED, increasing its\nefficiency and brightness, but reversibly degrading photovoltaic (PV)\nperformance, which can be easily recovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 08:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Under the conjecture, the observed dark energy cannot be explained by\nthe cosmological constant. The local maximum of the Higgs potential at the\nsymmetric point also contradicts with the conjecture. In order to make the\nStandard Model consistent with the conjecture, it has been proposed to\nintroduce a quintessence field, $Q$, which couples to the cosmological constant\nand the local maximum of the Higgs potential. In this paper, we show that such\na modified Higgs potential generically results in a $Q$-dependent Higgs vacuum\nexpectation value (VEV). The $Q$-dependence of the Higgs VEV induces a\nlong-range force, which is severely excluded by the tests of the equivalence\nprinciple. Besides, as the quintessence field is in motion, the Higgs VEV shows\na time-dependence, which is also severely constrained by the measurements of\nthe time-dependence of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Those constraints\nrequire an additional fine-tuning which is justified neither by the swampland\nconjecture nor the anthropic principle. We further show that, even if such an\nunjustified fine-tuning condition is imposed at the tree level, radiative\ncorrections upset it. Consequently, we argue that most of the habitable vacua\nin the string landscape are in tension with the phenomenological constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 08:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Here we\ninvestigate possible simulation artifacts introduced by common CVs adopted for\nthe study of the Cassie-Wenzel transition: the average particle density in the\ncorrugation of a textured surface and the coarse grained density field at\nvarious levels of coarse graining. We also investigate possible additional\nartifacts associated to finite size effects. We focus on a pillared surface. We\nshow that the use of the average density of fluid in the interpillar region\nbrings to severe artifacts in the relative Cassie-Wenzel stability and in the\ntransition barrier. A proper description of the wetting mechanism and its\nenergetics requires a rather fine discretization of the density field.\nConcerning the finite size effects, we have found that the typical system\nemployed in the Cassie-Wenzel transition, containing a single pillar within\nperiodic boundary conditions, prevents the break of translational symmetry of\nthe liquid-vapor meniscus during the process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 08:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

The framework covers: data collection paradigm, data\nanalysis, and statistical framework. To illustrate, data was collected from 12\ndifferent devices totaling up to 6 subjects per device. Two data acquisition\nprotocols were implemented: a resting-state protocol eyes-open (EO) and\neyes-closed (EC), and an Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) protocol.\nSignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on alpha band (EO/EC) and Event Related Potential\n(ERP) were extracted as objective quantification of physiologically meaningful\ninformation. Then, visual representation, univariate statistical analysis, and\nmultivariate model were performed to increase results interpretability.\nObjective criteria show that the spectral SNR in alpha does not provide much\ndiscrimination between systems, suggesting that the acquisition quality might\nnot be of primary importance for spectral and specifically alpha-based\napplications. On the contrary, AEP SNR proved much more variable stressing the\nimportance of the acquisition setting for ERP experiments.

Such estimates often\ndepend on approximations of the smallest or largest eigenvalue of~$A$.\n  In the paper we introduce a new upper bound for the $A$-norm of the error,\nwhich is closely related to the Gauss-Radau upper bound, and discuss the\nproblem of choosing the parameter $\\mu$ which should represent a lower bound\nfor the smallest eigenvalue of $A$.The new bound has several practical\nadvantages, the most important one is that it can be used as an approximation\nto the $A$-norm of the error even if $\\mu$ is not exactly a lower bound for the\nsmallest eigenvalue of $A$. In this case, $\\mu$ can be chosen, e.g., as the\nsmallest Ritz value or its approximation.

A knowledge base is then composed of an instance that contains\nincomplete data and a set of existential rules, and answers to queries are\nlogically entailed from the knowledge base. This brought again to light the\nfundamental chase tool, and its different variants that have been proposed in\nthe literature. It is well-known that the problem of determining, given a chase\nvariant and a set of existential rules, whether the chase will halt on any\ninstance, is undecidable. Hence, a crucial issue is whether it becomes\ndecidable for known subclasses of existential rules. In this work, we consider\nlinear existential rules, a simple yet important subclass of existential rules\nthat generalizes inclusion dependencies. We show the decidability of the all\ninstance chase termination problem on linear rules for three main chase\nvariants, namely semi-oblivious, restricted and core chase. To obtain these\nresults, we introduce a novel approach based on so-called derivation trees and\na single notion of forbidden pattern. Besides the theoretical interest of a\nunified approach and new proofs, we provide the first positive decidability\nresults concerning the termination of the restricted chase, proving that chase\ntermination on linear existential rules is decidable for both versions of the\nproblem: Does every fair chase sequence terminate? Does some fair chase\nsequence terminate?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 10:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-05"}

We analyzed a series of high-resolution multiepoch\noptical spectra to determine the orbital parameters, projected rotational\nvelocities, and evolutionary status of the system. Results.

Perturbative deviations from this sector lead to classical\nsolutions that necessarily display relatively small values of the cosmological\nconstant with respect to the would-be contribution of quantum vacuum\nfluctuations. This feature that goes beyond general relativity (and unimodular\ngravity) offers an interpretation of the smallness of the currently observed\ncosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 11:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

The\nvariation of a nonlocal operator is similar to the derivative of shape function\nin meshless and finite element methods, thus circumvents difficulty in the\ncalculation of shape function and its derivatives. {The nonlocal operator\nmethod is consistent with the variational principle and the weighted residual\nmethod, based on which the residual and the tangent stiffness matrix can be\nobtained with ease.} The nonlocal operator method is equipped with an hourglass\nenergy functional to satisfy the linear consistency of the field. Higher order\nnonlocal operators and higher order hourglass energy functional are\ngeneralized. The functional based on the nonlocal operator converts the\nconstruction of residual and stiffness matrix into a series of matrix\nmultiplications on the nonlocal operators.

We discuss the status of the theoretical understanding of the\nAnderson-Josephson quantum dot in equilibrium mainly focusing on the Josephson\ncurrent.

At vanishing temperature it leads to a jump of the\nJosephson current. We show that a quantitative agreement between accurate\nresults obtained for the simple model and measurements of the current can be\nreached. This confirms that the experiments reveal the finite temperature\nsignatures of the zero temperature transition.

This extends the notion of primitive\nword: indeed, $\\{w\\}$ is a primitive set if and only if $w$ is a primitive\nword.\n  By definition, for any set $X$, there exists a primitive set $Y$ such that $X\n\\subseteq Y^*$. The set $Y$ is therefore called a primitive root of $X$. As a\nmain result, we prove that if a set has rank $2$, then it has a unique\nprimitive root.

We find that HMHD simulations exhibit spectral\nproperties that are in most cases in agreement with the results of the HPIC\nsimulations and with solar wind observations. The energy spectra of magnetic\nfluctuations exhibit a double power-law with spectral index $-5/3$ at MHD\nscales and $-3$ at kinetic scales, while for velocity fluctuations the spectral\nindex is $-3/2$ at MHD scales. The break between the MHD and the kinetic scales\noccurs at the same scale in both simulations.

The development of a turbulent cascade is concurrently characterized\nby magnetic reconnection events taking place in thin current sheets that form\nbetween large eddies.

The jet carries dense radiation\nand the turbulence cascade can be damped by Compton drag, passing kinetic fluid\nenergy to photons through scattering. We identify two regimes of turbulence\ndissipation: (1) \"Viscous\" - the turbulence cascade is Compton damped on a\nscale $\\ell_{\\rm damp}$ greater than the photon mean free path $\\ell_\\star$.\nThen turbulence energy is passed to photons via bulk Comptonization by smooth\nshear flows on scale $\\ell_\\star<\\ell_{\\rm damp}$.

The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag.

However, metrics that quantify the overall translation\nquality are ill-equipped to measure gains from additional context.

Such bonus\nis summed up with the real task reward - making it possible for RL algorithms\nto learn from the combined reward. We propose a new curiosity method which uses\nepisodic memory to form the novelty bonus. To determine the bonus, the current\nobservation is compared with the observations in memory.

We tackle this problem in two steps: 1) learning a task\nconditional visual classifier, which is capable of solving diverse\nquestion-specific visual recognition tasks, based on unsupervised task\ndiscovery and 2) transferring the task conditional visual classifier to visual\nquestion answering models. Specifically, we employ linguistic knowledge sources\nsuch as structured lexical database (e.g. WordNet) and visual descriptions for\nunsupervised task discovery, and transfer a learned task conditional visual\nclassifier as an answering unit in a visual question answering model. We\nempirically show that the proposed algorithm generalizes to out-of-vocabulary\nanswers successfully using the knowledge transferred from the visual dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2018 19:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 11:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

If we\nvary the temperature in a wide enough range, the effective dimensionality of\nthe phonon gas distribution changes going through a crossover around some\ntemperature, $T_C$. These changes are reflected by a change in $x$. On one\nhand, in a temperature range well below a crossover temperature $T_C$ only the\nlowest branches of the phonon modes are excited. They form a (quasi)\ntwo-dimensional gas, with $x=3.5$.

But this is not the case\nin our layered structure. The exponent $x$ has a complicated, non-monotonous\ndependence on temperature forming a \"plateau region\" just after the crossover\ntemperature range, with $x$ between 4.5 and 5. After the plateau region, $x$\ndecreases, reaching values between 3.5 and 4 at the highest temperature used in\nour numerical calculations, which is more than 40 times higher than $T_C$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 10:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Recently, the sum-of-norms (SON) model (also known as the\nclustering path) has been proposed in Pelckmans et al. (2005), Lindsten et al.\n(2011) and Hocking et al. (2011). The perfect recovery properties of the convex\nclustering model with uniformly weighted all pairwise-differences\nregularization have been proved by Zhu et al. (2014) and Panahi et al.

In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions for the perfect\nrecovery guarantee of the general weighted convex clustering model, which\ninclude and improve existing theoretical results as special cases.

This tree represents the relationship between eleven corpora. We\nfound that in the tree generated by clustering, the distance between the corpus\nand the year corresponding to the corpus are basically the same. This means\nthat we have discovered a specific language evolution tree.

However, it\nposes important challenges arising from its intrinsic strong nonlinearity,\nill-posedness, and expensive computation costs. To tackle these difficulties,\nwe, for the first time to our best knowledge, exploit a connection between the\ndeep neural network (DNN) architecture and the iterative method of nonlinear EM\ninverse scattering. This enables the development of a novel DNN-based\nmethodology for nonlinear EM inverse problems (termed here DeepNIS).
