Depending on patients' clinical characteristics, the expression of\nspecific biomarkers or their combinations, different patient subgroups could\nrespond differently to the same treatment. An ideal design, especially at the\nproof of concept stage, should search for such subgroups and make dynamic\nadaptation as the trial goes on. When no prior knowledge is available on\nwhether the treatment works on the all-comer population or only works on the\nsubgroup defined by one biomarker or several biomarkers, it is necessary to\nincorporate the adaptive estimation of the heterogeneous treatment effect to\nthe decision-making at interim analyses. To address this problem, we propose an\nAdaptive Subgroup-Identification Enrichment Design, ASIED, to simultaneously\nsearch for predictive biomarkers, identify the subgroups with differential\ntreatment effects, and modify study entry criteria at interim analyses when\njustified. More importantly, we construct robust quantitative decision-making\nrules for population enrichment when the interim outcomes are heterogeneous in\nthe context of a multilevel target product profile, which defines the minimal\nand targeted levels of treatment effect. Through extensive simulations, the\nASIED is demonstrated to achieve desirable operating characteristics and\ncompare favorably against alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 16:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 03:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

The location of geological\nlineaments such as faults and dykes are of interest for a range of\napplications, particularly because of their association with hydrothermal\nmineralization. Although a wide range of applications have utilized computer\nvision techniques, a standard workflow for application of these techniques to\nmineral exploration is lacking. We present a framework for extracting\ngeological lineaments using computer vision techniques which is a combination\nof edge detection and line extraction algorithms for extracting geological\nlineaments using optical remote sensing data. It features ancillary computer\nvision techniques for reducing data dimensionality, removing noise and\nenhancing the expression of lineaments.

To validate the results, the extracted lineaments are compared to our\nmanual photointerpretation and geologically mapped structures by the Geological\nSurvey of Western Australia (GSWA). The results show that the best correlation\nbetween our extracted geological lineaments and the GSWA geological lineament\nmap is achieved by applying a minimum noise fraction transformation and a\nLaplacian filter. Application of a directional filter instead shows a stronger\ncorrelation with the output of our manual photointerpretation and known sites\nof hydrothermal mineralization. Hence, our framework using either filter can be\nused for mineral prospectivity mapping in other regions where faults are\nexposed and observable in optical remote sensing data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 17:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

Each time step for SFI consists of an\nouter loop to solve the coupled system, in which there is one inner Newton loop\nto implicitly solve the pressure equation and another loop to implicitly solve\nthe transport equations. Limited research has been conducted that deals with\nthe outer coupling level to investigate the convergence performance. In this\npaper we extend the basic SFI method with several nonlinear acceleration\ntechniques for improving the outer-loop convergence.

Planetesimal formation via streaming instability is\ntaken into account, partly based on previous results on streaming instability\noutside the water snowline that were presented in Schoonenberg & Ormel (2017).\nWe validate our model by reproducing earlier results from the literature and\napply our model to steady-state viscous gas disks (with constant gas accretion\nrate) around stars with different masses. We also present various other models\nwhere we explore the effects of pebble accretion, the fragmentation velocity\nthreshold, the global metallicity of the disk, and a time-dependent gas\naccretion rate. We find that planetesimals preferentially form in a local\nannulus outside the water snowline, at early times in the lifetime of the disk\n($\\lesssim$$10^{5} \\: \\rm{yr}$), when the pebble mass fluxes are high enough to\ntrigger the streaming instability. During this first phase in the planet\nformation process, the snowline location hardly changes due to slow viscous\nevolution, and we conclude that assuming a constant gas accretion rate is\njustified in this first stage. The efficiency of converting the solids\nreservoir of the disk to planetesimals depends on the location of the water\nsnowline. Cooler disks with a closer-in water snowline are more efficient at\nproducing planetesimals than hotter disks where the water snowline is located\nfurther away from the star.

Like the 3D TI, it exhibits a quantized\nmagnetoelectric polarizability of $\\theta=\\pi$, and can be diagnosed from bulk\nsymmetry eigenvalues when inversion symmetric. However, whereas a 3D TI is\ncharacterized by bulk Wilson loop winding, 2D surface states, and the pumping\nof the 2D $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ TI index, we show that an AXI with a large number of\nbulk bands displays no Wilson loop winding, exhibits chiral hinge states, and\ndoes not pump any previously identified quantity.

There is very\nlittle known on the effectiveness of these report formats or the criteria\nnecessary to improve them. In this study, we have aimed to identify both the\ntasks and the needs of oncologists from precision oncology report design and\nthen to improve the designs based on these findings. To this end, we report\nresults from multiple interviews and a survey study (n=32) conducted with\npracticing oncologists. Based on these results, we compiled a set of design\ncriteria for precision oncology reports and developed a prototype report design\nusing these criteria, along with feedback from oncologists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 18:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

The last decade has seen the rise of Bayesian hierarchical models\nin ecology. Consequently, popular tools, such as the AIC, become largely\ninapplicable and other tools are not universally applicable. We focus on a\nclass of competing Bayesian spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) models\nand first apply some of the recommended Bayesian model selection tools: (1)\nBayes Factor - using (a) Gelfand-Dey (b) harmonic mean methods, (2) DIC, (3)\nWAIC and (4) the posterior predictive loss function. In all, we evaluate 25\nvariants of model selection tools in our study. We evaluate these model\nselection tools from the standpoint of model selection and parameter estimation\nby contrasting the choice recommended by a tool with a `true' model. In all, we\ngenerate 120 simulated data sets using the true model and assess the frequency\nwith which the true model is selected and how well the tool estimates N\n(population size). We find that when information content is low, no particular\ntool can be recommended to help realise, simultaneously, both the goals of\nmodel selection and parameter estimation. In such scenarios, we recommend that\npractitioners utilise our application of Bayes Factor for parameter estimation\nand recommend the posterior predictive loss approach for model selection when\ninformation content is low. When both the objectives are taken together, we\nrecommend the use of our applications of Bayes Factor for Bayesian SECR models.\nOur study reveals that although new model selection tools are emerging (eg:\nWAIC) in the applied statistics literature, an uncritical absorption of these\nnew tools (i.e. without assessing their efficacies for the problem at hand)\ninto ecological practice may mislead inferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 19:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

The density wake keeps a memory of\nthe past mass history of the perturber. For dissolving perturbers, the density\nfield is more dense than expected using the instantaneous mass of the perturber\nin the classical formula. As a consequence, the instantaneous-mass\napproximation underestimates the drag force for mass-losing perturbers and\noverestimates it for mass-gaining perturbers. We present cases in which the\npercentage error in the drag force using the instantaneous-mass approximation\nis greater than 50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 20:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

We also\nconsider a number of generalizations that include systems with an\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert space at each lattice site and Hamiltonians that\nmay involve unbounded on-site contributions. These generalizations require\nreplacing the operator norm topology with the strong operator topology in a\nnumber of basic results for the dynamics of quantum lattice systems. The main\nresults in this paper form the basis for a detailed proof of the stability of\ngapped ground state phases of frustration-free models satisfying a Local\nTopological Quantum Order condition, which we present in a sequel to this\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 21:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 17:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

Our trading strategy, which extends\nOrdentlich and Cover's (1998) \"max-min universal portfolio,\" guarantees to\nachieve an acceptable percentage of the hindsight-optimized wealth, a\npercentage which tends to zero at a slow (polynomial) rate. This means that on\na long enough investment horizon, the trader can enforce a compound-annual\ngrowth rate that is arbitrarily close to that of the best pairs rebalancing\nrule in hindsight. The strategy will \"beat the market asymptotically\" if there\nturns out to exist a pairs rebalancing rule that grows capital at a higher\nasymptotic rate than the market index. The advantages of our algorithm over the\nOrdentlich and Cover (1998) strategy are twofold. First, their strategy is\nimpossible to compute in practice. Second, in considering the more modest\nbenchmark (instead of the best all-stock rebalancing rule in hindsight), we\nreduce the \"cost of universality\" and achieve a higher learning rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 22:30:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 21:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 23:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

In the PICOD$(t)$ problem there are $m$\nmessages, $n$ users and each user has a distinct message side information set,\nas in the classical Index Coding problem (IC). Differently from IC, where each\nuser has a pre-specified set of messages to decode, in the PICOD$(t)$ a user is\n\"pliable\" and is satisfied if it can decode any $t$ messages that are not in\nits side information set. The goal is to find a code with the shortest length\nthat satisfies all the users. This flexibility in determining the desired\nmessage sets makes the PICOD$(t)$ behave quite differently compared to the IC,\nand its analysis challenging.\n  This paper mainly focuses on the \\emph{complete--$S$} PICOD$(t)$ with $m$\nmessages, where the set $S\\subset[m]$ contains the sizes of the side\ninformation sets, and the number of users is $n=\\sum_{s\\in S}\\binom{m}{s}$,\nwith no two users having the same side information set.

The target is unique in\nthat it has an orbit dynamically decoupled from Jupiter like main-belt\nasteroids, while ejecting gas and dust like ordinary comets. We observed the\ncomet using the Higashi-Hiroshima Optical and Near-Infrared Camera attached to\nthe Cassegrain focus of the 150-cm Kanata telescope on UT 2017 February 21 when\nthe comet was at the solar phase angle of 75.7 deg. We find that the continuum\npolarization degree with respect to the scattering plane is 33.8+/-2.7 % at the\neffective wavelength of 0.815 um, which is significantly higher than those of\ncometary dust in a high-Pmax group at similar phase angles. Assuming that an\nensemble polarimetric response of 2P/Encke's dust as a function of phase angle\nis morphologically similar with those of other comets, its maximum polarization\ndegree is estimated to > 40 % at the phase angle of ~100 deg. In addition, we\nobtain the polarization degrees of the C2 swan bands (0.51-0.56 um), the NH2\nalpha bands (0.62-0.69 um) and the CN-red system (0.78-0.94 um) in a range of\n3-19 %, which depend on the molecular species and rotational quantum numbers of\neach branch. The polarization vector aligns nearly perpendicularly to the\nscattering plane with the average of 0.4 deg over a wavelength range of\n0.50-0.97 um. From the observational evidence, we conjecture that the large\npolarization degree of 2P/Encke would be attributable to a dominance of large\ndust particles around the nucleus, which have remained after frequent\nperihelion passages near the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 23:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Here, we report the\nantiskyrmion motion with the combined action of the in-plane magnetic field and\nmicrowave electric fields. The in-plane mag- netic field breaks the rotation\nsymmetry of the antiskyrmion, and perpendicular microwave electric field\ninduces the pumping of magnetic anisotropy, leading to antiskyrmion breathing\nmode. With above two effects, the antiskyrmion propagates with a desired\ntrajectory. Antiskyrmion propagation velocity depends on the frequency,\namplitude of anisotropy pumping, and damping constant as well as strength of\nin-plane field, which reaches the maximum value when the frequency of microwave\nelectric field is in consist with the resonance frequency of antiskyrmion.\nMoreover, we show that the antiskyrmion propagation depends on the direction of\nmagnetic field, where the antiskyrmion Hall angle can be suppressed or\nenhanced. At a critical direction of magnetic field, the Hall angle is zero.\nOur results introduce a possible application of antiskyrmion in\nantiskyrmion-based spintronic devices with lower energy consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 00:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

Our\nCNN first encodes modality-specific features and then uses them to derive a\nspatially varying fusion map that quantifies the relative importance of each\nmodality's features across different spatial locations. These fusion maps are\nthen multiplied with the modality-specific feature maps to obtain a\nrepresentation of the complementary multi-modality information at different\nlocations, which can then be used for image analysis.

Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel randomized\ngossip-based distributed Kalman filtering algorithm. Information exchange and\ncomputation in the proposed algorithm can be carried out in an arbitrarily\nconnected network of nodes. In addition, the computational burden can be\ndistributed for a sensor which communicates with a stochastically selected\nneighbor at each clock step under schemes of gossip algorithm. In this case,\nthe error covariance matrix changes stochastically at every clock step, thus\nthe convergence is considered in a probabilistic sense. We provide the mean\nsquare convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm. Under a sufficient\ncondition, we show that the proposed algorithm is quite appealing as it\nachieves better mean square error performance theoretically than the\nnoncooperative decentralized Kalman filtering algorithm. Besides, considering\nthe limited computation, communication, and energy resources in the wireless\nsensor networks, we propose an optimization problem which minimizes the average\nexpected state estimation error based on the proposed algorithm. To solve the\nproposed problem efficiently, we transform it into a convex optimization\nproblem. And a sub-optimal solution is attained. Examples and simulations are\nprovided to illustrate the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 06:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

Due to the existence of different types of traffic,\nprovisioning of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a challenge in the wireless\nnetworks. In case of a congested network, resource allocation has emerged as an\neffective way to provide the excessive users with desirable QoS. Since QoS for\nnon-real-time traffic are not as strict as for real-time traffic, the\nunoccupied channels of the adjacent cells can be assigned to the non-real-time\ntraffic to retain QoS for real-time traffic. This results in the intensified\nbandwidth utilization as well as less interference for the real-time traffic.\nIn this paper, we propose an effective radio resource management scheme that\nrelies on the dynamically assigned bandwidth allocation process. In case of\ninterference management, we classify the traffic into real-time traffic and\nnon-real-time traffic and give priority to the real-time traffic. According to\nour scheme, the real-time traffic among the excessive number of users are\nreassigned to the original channels which have been occupied by non-real-time\ntraffic and the non-real-time traffic are allocated to the assigned channels of\nthose real-time traffic. The architecture allows improved signal to\ninterference plus noise ratio (SINR) for real-time traffic along with\nintensification in the bandwidth utilization of the network. Besides, the\nincreased system capacity and lower outage probability of the network bear the\nsignificance of the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 07:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

To degrade the estimation\nquality with power constraint, the attacker aims to solve how much power to\nobstruct the channel each time, which is the recently proposed optimal attack\nenergy management problem. The existing works are built on an ideal link model\nin which the packet dropout never occurs without attack. To encompass wireless\ntransmission losses, we introduce the SINR-based link. First, we focus on the\ncase when the attacker employs the constant power level. To maximize the\nterminal error at the remote estimator, we provide some sufficient conditions\nfor the existence of an explicit solution to the optimal static attack energy\nmanagement problem and the solution is constructed. Compared with the existing\nresult in which corresponding sufficient conditions work only when the system\nmatrix is normal, the obtained conditions in this paper are viable for a\ngeneral system and shown to be more relaxed. For the other system index, the\naverage error, the associated sufficient conditions are also derived based on\ndifferent analysis with the existing work. And a feasible method is presented\nfor both indexes when the system cannot meet the sufficient conditions. Then\nwhen the real-time ACK information can be acquired, an MDP based algorithm is\ndesigned to solve the optimal dynamic attack energy management problem. We\nfurther study the optimal tradeoff between attack power and system degradation.\nBy moving power constraint into the objective function to maximize system index\nand minimize energy consumption, the other MDP based algorithm is proposed to\nfind the optimal attack policy which is further shown to have a monotone\nstructure.

In such\na system, a control over static-field magnitude or oscillating-field frequency\nprovides detection of strength of the DC or AC fields. Polarization rotation is\ninvestigated for various light intensities and AC-field amplitudes, which\nallows to determine optimum sensitivity to both fields. With the results, we\ndemonstrate that under optimal conditions the AC magnetometer is about ten\ntimes more sensitive than its DC counterpart, which originates from different\nresponse of the atoms to the fields.

However, previous afterglow modeling studies\nwere based on a simplified assumption that the acceleration efficiency is\nextremely high, i.e. all electrons in the shock are accelerated as a nonthermal\npopulation. This affects the estimate of the minimum electron energy and hence\n$\\nu_m$, the peak frequency of the afterglow spectrum. Here we present Bayesian\nfitting to the observed data with a more natural electron energy distribution,\nin which the acceleration efficiency is a free parameter. Interestingly, the\nmaximum likelihood solutions are found with radio flux below $\\nu_m$ in the\nearly phase, in contrast to previous studies that found the radio frequency\nalways above $\\nu_m$. Therefore the $\\nu_m$ passage through the radio band\ncould have been clearly detected for GW170817, if sufficient low-frequency\nradio data had been taken in early time. In the new solutions, the lowest\nenergy of electrons is found close to equipartition with the post shock\nprotons, but only a small fraction ($<$10\\%) of electrons are accelerated as\nnonthermal particles. The jet energy and interstellar medium density are\nincreased by 1--2 orders of magnitude from the conventional modeling, though\nthese are still consistent with other constraints. We encourage to take densely\nsampled low-frequency radio data in the early phase for future BNS merger\nevents, which would potentially detect $\\nu_m$ passage and give a strong\nconstraint on electron energy distribution and particle acceleration\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 09:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 03:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

Specifically, we\nanalyze how a breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry spreads during renormalization\ngroup evolution; employing general 2-loop renormalization group equations that\nwe have derived. Evolving the model from the electroweak to the Planck scale,\nwe find that while the case of an exact $Z_2$ symmetric 2HDM is very\nconstrained, a soft breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry extends the valid parameter\nspace regions.

However, several challenges, such as vehicle\nlocalization, are involved in the development of autonomous vehicles. A simple\nand secure algorithm for vehicle positioning is proposed herein without\nmassively modifying the existing transportation infrastructure. For vehicle\nlocalization, vehicles on the road are classified into two categories: host\nvehicles (HVs) are the ones used to estimate other vehicles' positions and\nforwarding vehicles (FVs) are the ones that move in front of the HVs. The FV\ntransmits modulated data from the tail (or back) light, and the camera of the\nHV receives that signal using optical camera communication (OCC). In addition,\nthe streetlight (SL) data are considered to ensure the position accuracy of the\nHV. Determining the HV position minimizes the relative position variation\nbetween the HV and FV. Using photogrammetry, the distance between FV or SL and\nthe camera of the HV is calculated by measuring the occupied image area on the\nimage sensor. Comparing the change in distance between HV and SLs with the\nchange in distance between HV and FV, the positions of FVs are determined. The\nperformance of the proposed technique is analyzed, and the results indicate a\nsignificant improvement in performance. The experimental distance measurement\nvalidated the feasibility of the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 10:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

The system needs to efficiently\nallocate its frequency spectrum such that the spectrum utilization can be\nmaximized while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) level. Owing to the\ncoexistence of different types of traffic (e.g., real-time (RT) and\nnon-real-time (nRT)) and different types of networks (e.g., small cell and\nmacrocell), ensuring the QoS level for different types of users becomes a\nchallenging issue in wireless networks. Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is an\neffective approach for increasing spectrum utilization and reducing\ninterference effects in orthogonal frequency division multiple access networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a new FFR scheme in which bandwidth allocation is\nbased on RT/nRT traffic classification. We consider the coexistence of small\ncells and macrocells. After applying FFR technique in macrocells, the remaining\nfrequency bands are efficiently allocated among the small cells overlaid by a\nmacrocell. In our proposed scheme, total frequency-band allocations for\ndifferent macrocells are decided on the basis of the traffic intensity. The\ntransmitted power levels for different frequency bands are controlled based on\nthe level of interference from a nearby frequency band. Frequency bands with a\nlower level of interference are assigned to the RT traffic to ensure a higher\nQoS level for the RT traffic. RT traffic calls in macrocell networks are also\ngiven a higher priority compared with nRT traffic calls to ensure the low\ncall-blocking rate. Performance analyses show significant improvement under the\nproposed scheme compared with conventional FFR schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 10:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with\nan intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could\naccelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish\nthis, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by\nexplaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and\nphysiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the\namount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability\nto self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order\nto further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with\nincreasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about\nenvironment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation\nin the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine,\nhuman action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can\nbe implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment,\nbody and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine\nlearning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared\nrepresentation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards\nhybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the\nart probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation\nmight have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and\nsuggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to\nexecute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 12:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

To address this\nissue, we report here an electron transmission model that evaluates the role of\nthe CISS effect in two-terminal and multi-terminal linear-regime electron\ntransport experiments. Our model reveals that for the CISS effect, the\nchirality-dependent spin transmission is accompanied by a spin-flip electron\nreflection process. Furthermore, we show that more than two terminals are\nrequired in order to probe the CISS effect in the linear regime. In addition,\nwe propose two types of multi-terminal nonlocal transport measurements that can\ndistinguish the CISS effect from other magnetic-field-dependent signals. Our\nmodel provides an effective tool to review and design CISS-related transport\nexperiments, and to enlighten the mechanism of the CISS effect itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 13:13:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 09:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

This process has been analyzed in the\nphysics literature under the name \"random walk with preferential relocations\",\nwhere it is argued that the position of the walker after $n$ steps, scaled by\n$\\log n$, converges to a Gaussian random variable; because of the $\\log$\nspatial scaling, the process is said to undergo a \"slow diffusion\".\n  In this paper, we generalize this model by allowing the underlying random\nwalk to be any Markov process and the random run-lengths (time between two\nrelocations) to be i.i.d.-distributed. We also allow the memory of the walker\nto fade with time, meaning that when a relocations occurs, the walker is more\nlikely to go back to a place it has visited more recently.\n  We prove rigorously the central limit theorem described above (plus a local\nlimit theorem and the convergence of the weighted occupation measure) by\nassociating to the process a growing family of vertex-weighted random recursive\ntrees and a Markov chain indexed by this tree. The spatial scaling of our\nrelocated random walk is related to the height of a \"typical\" vertex in the\nrandom tree. This typical height can range from doubly-logarithmic to\nlogarithmic or even a power of the number of nodes of the tree, depending on\nthe form of the memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 14:57:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 17:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 16:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Certain simple consequences of the Fermi\nstatistics in pure metals are first addressed, namely the Peierls distortion,\nKohn anomalies and the Labb\\'e-Friedel distortion. Then the physics of dilute\nalloys is discussed. The analogy with nuclear collisions was a fruitful\nstarting point, which suggested one should analyse the effects of impurities in\nterms of a scattering problem with the introduction of phase shifts. Starting\nfrom these concepts, Friedel derived a theory of the resistivity of alloys, and\na celebrated sum rule relating the phase shifts at the Fermi level to the\nnumber of electrons in the impurity, which turned out to play a prominent role\nlater in the context of correlated impurities, as for instance in the Kondo\neffect. Friedel oscillations are also an important result, related to\nincommensurate magnetic structures. It is shown how they can be derived in\nvarious ways: from collision theory, perturbation theory, self-consistent\napproximations and Green's function methods. While collision theory does not\npermit to take the crystal structure into account, which is responsible for\nelectronic bands, those effects can be included in other descriptions, using\nfor instance the tight binding approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 15:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-08"}

The first rule is the\nsimple AC without weights. The AC rule presents {performance comparable to the\ntraditional cooperative spectrum sensing} (CSS) techniques, such as the equal\ngain combining (EGC) rule, which is a soft combining centralised method.\nAnother technique is the weighted average consensus (WAC) rule using the\nweights based on the SUs channel condition.

Two new AC rules are analysed, namely weighted average\nconsensus accuracy exchange (WAC-AE), and improved weighted average consensus\n(IWAC); the former relates the weights to the channel conditions of the SUs\nneighbours, while the latter combines the conditions of WAC and WAC-AE in the\nsame rule.

Despite promising recent\nprogress, a significant open challenge is to distinguish obscured targets from\nother (natural and manmade) clutter sources in the scene. The problem becomes\nexacerbated in the presence of noisy responses from rough ground surfaces. In\nthis paper, we present three novel sparsity-driven techniques, which not only\nexploit the subtle features of raw captured data but also take advantage of the\npolarization diversity and the aspect angle dependence information from\nmulti-channel SAR data. First, the traditional sparse representation-based\nclassification (SRC) is generalized to exploit shared information of classes\nand various sparsity structures of tensor coefficients for multi-channel data.\nCorresponding tensor dictionary learning models are consequently proposed to\nenhance classification accuracy. Lastly, a new tensor sparsity model is\nproposed to model responses from multiple consecutive looks of objects, which\nis a unique characteristic of the dataset we consider. Extensive experimental\nresults on a high-fidelity electromagnetic simulated dataset and radar data\ncollected from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory side-looking SAR demonstrate\nthe advantages of proposed tensor sparsity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 22:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

We find that the southern\ncold front exhibits well-developed Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) eddies seen in the sky\nplane. Comparing their wavelength and amplitude with those in hydrodynamic\nsimulations of cold fronts in viscous gas, and estimating the gas tangential\nvelocity from centripetal acceleration, we constrain the effective viscosity to\nbe at most 1/5 of Spitzer isotropic viscosity, but consistent with full\nBraginskii anisotropic viscosity for magnetized plasma. While the northwestern\nfront does not show obvious eddies, its shape and the structure of its\nbrightness profile suggest KH eddies seen in projection. The southern cold\nfront continues in a spiral to the center of the cluster, ending with another\ncold front only 12 kpc from the gas density peak. The cool peak itself is\ndisplaced ~30 kpc from the BCG (the biggest such offset among centrally-peaked\nclusters), while the X-ray emission on a larger scale is still centered on the\nBCG, indicating that the BCG is at the center of the gravitational potential\nand the cool gas is sloshing in it. The specific entropy index of the gas in\nthe peak ($K\\approx49$ keV cm$^2$) makes A2142 a rare \"warm core\"; apparently\nthe large displacement of the cool peak by sloshing is the reason.

The existing scoring\napproaches focus on only either probability of default (PD) prediction, known\nas credit scoring, or profitability prediction, known as profit scoring, to\nidentify the best loans for investment. Credit scoring fails to deliver the\nmain need of lenders on how much profit they may obtain through their\ninvestment. On the other hand, profit scoring can satisfy that need by\npredicting the investment profitability. However, profit scoring completely\nignores the class imbalance problem where most of the past loans are\nnon-default. Consequently, ignorance of the class imbalance problem\nsignificantly affects the accuracy of profitability prediction. Our proposed\ntwo-stage scoring approach is an integration of credit scoring and profit\nscoring to address the above challenges. More specifically, stage 1 is designed\nas credit scoring to identify non-default loans while the imbalanced nature of\nloan status is considered in PD prediction. The loans identified as non-default\nare then moved to stage 2 for prediction of profitability, measured by internal\nrate of return. Wide and deep learning is used to build the predictive models\nin both stages to achieve both memorization and generalization. Extensive\nnumerical studies are conducted based on real-world data to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach. The numerical studies indicate our\ntwo-stage scoring approach outperforms the existing credit scoring and profit\nscoring approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 00:54:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 02:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

In this paper, we present methods to model the entire\nmarginal distribution of pixel intensities via the quantile function as\nfunctional data, regressed on a set of demographic, clinical, and genetic\npredictors.

This is suggestive of the fact that complexity in\nalgorithmic structures can be unnecessary, if not detrimental, and that simple\nbottom-up approaches are likely to be competitive is here invoked as an\nextension to Memetic Computing basing on the philosophical concept of Ockham's\nRazor. An extensive experimental setup on various test problems and one digital\nsignal processing application is presented. Numerical results show that the\nproposed approach, despite its simplicity and low computational cost displays a\nvery good performance on several problems, and is competitive with\nsophisticated algorithms representing the-state-of-the-art in computational\nintelligence optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 14:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

The definition of rate change\nas a statistical parameter is proposed to address the stochastic nature of the\npremium charged for a policy. It promotes the idea that rate change is a\nproperty of an asymptotic population to be estimated, not just a property to\nmeasure or monitor in the sample of observed policies that are written. Various\nmodels and techniques are given for estimating this stochastic rate change and\nquantifying the uncertainty in the estimates. The use of matched sampling is\nemphasized for rate change estimation, as it adjusts for changes in policy\ncharacteristics by directly searching for similar policies across policy years.\nThis avoids any of the assumptions and recipes that are required to re-rate\npolicies in years where they were not written, as is common with deterministic\nmethods. Such procedures can be subjective or implausible if the structure of\nrating algorithms change or there are complex and heterogeneous exposure bases\nand coverages. The methods discussed are applied to a motor premium database.\nThe application includes the use of a genetic algorithm with parallel\ncomputations to automatically optimize the matched sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 19:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

This population\nconcentration is capable of boosting the growth of positive indicators such as\ninnovation, the production of new patents and supercreative employment, but\nincreases the spread of diseases and the occurrence of crimes. Faced with the\nrealization that crime rates grow year after year in these large urban centers,\nwe sought to understand the dynamics of crime within cities. We investigate at\nthe subscale of the neighborhoods of a highly populated city the incidence of\nproperty crimes in terms of both the resident and the floating population. Our\nresults show that a relevant allometric relation could only be observed between\nproperty crimes and floating population. More precisely, the evidence of a\nsuperlinear behavior indicates that a disproportional number of property crimes\noccurs in regions where an increased flow of people takes place in the city.\nFor comparison, we also found that the number of crimes of peace disturbance\nonly correlates well, and in a superlinear fashion too, with the resident\npopulation. Our study raises the interesting possibility that the\nsuperlinearity observed in previous studies [Bettencourt et al., Proc. Natl.\nAcad. Sci. USA 104, 7301 (2007) and Melo et al., Sci. Rep. 4, 6239 (2014)] for\nhomicides versus population at the city scale could have its origin in the fact\nthat the floating population, and not the resident one, should be taken as the\nrelevant variable determining the intrinsic microdynamical behavior of the\nsystem. This finding was the motivation for the codification of a framework\nthat supports the analysis of population and crime data to propose city\ndivisions that allow the allocation of police by floating population and\nresident population statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2018 18:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}
