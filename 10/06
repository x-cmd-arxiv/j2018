It is therefore a\npotentially important process in heating the solar corona. However, it is\nunclear how the instability is influenced by the oscillatory shear flow\nassociated with an MHD wave. We investigate the linear stability of a\ndiscontinuous oscillatory shear flow in the presence of a horizontal magnetic\nfield within a Cartesian framework that captures the essential features of MHD\noscillations in flux tubes. We derive a Mathieu equation for the Lagrangian\ndisplacement of the interface and analyse its properties, identifying two\ndifferent instabilities: a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a parametric\ninstability involving resonance between the oscillatory shear flow and two\nsurface Alfv\\'{e}n waves. The latter occurs when the system is Kelvin-Helmholtz\nstable, thus favouring modes that vary along the flux tube, and as a\nconsequence provides an important and additional mechanism to extract energy.\nWhen applied to flows with the characteristic properties of kink waves in the\nsolar corona, both instabilities can grow, with the parametric instability\ncapable of generating smaller scale disturbances along the magnetic field than\npossible via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The characteristic time-scale\nfor these instabilities is $\\sim 100$ s, for wavelengths of $200$ km. The\nparametric instability is more likely to occur for smaller density contrasts\nand larger velocity shears, making its development more likely on coronal loops\nthan on prominence threads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 16:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

These elusive particles may nonetheless be produced\nefficiently in the early universe and their gravitational influence could be\ndetectable in cosmological observables. In this thesis, we describe how\nmeasurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale\nstructure (LSS) of the universe can shed new light on the properties of\nneutrinos and on the possible existence of other light relics.\n  These observations are remarkably sensitive to the amount of radiation in the\nearly universe, partly because free-streaming species such as neutrinos imprint\na small phase shift in the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) which we study in\ndetail.

We find a simple scaling behavior of the Floquet\nexponents for large values of the field-space curvature, that enables a quick\nestimation of the $T$-model reheating efficiency for any large value of the\nfield-space curvature. In this regime we further observe and explain universal\npreheating features that arise for different values of the potential steepness.\nIn general preheating is faster for larger negative values of the field-space\ncurvature and steeper potentials. For very highly curved field-space manifolds\npreheating is essentially instantaneous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2018 17:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

Manually screening to select appropriate candidates\nfrom large amounts of resumes can be exhausted and time-consuming. However,\nthere is no public tool that can be directly used for automatic resume quality\nassessment (RQA). This motivates us to develop a method for automatic RQA.\nSince there is also no public dataset for model training and evaluation, we\nbuild a dataset for RQA by collecting around 10K resumes, which are provided by\na private resume management company. By investigating the dataset, we identify\nsome factors or features that could be useful to discriminate good resumes from\nbad ones, e.g., the consistency between different parts of a resume. Then a\nneural-network model is designed to predict the quality of each resume, where\nsome text processing techniques are incorporated. To deal with the label\ndeficiency issue in the dataset, we propose several variants of the model by\neither utilizing the pair/triplet-based loss, or introducing some\nsemi-supervised learning technique to make use of the abundant unlabeled data.\nBoth the presented baseline model and its variants are general and easy to\nimplement. Various popular criteria including the receiver operating\ncharacteristic (ROC) curve, F-measure and ranking-based average precision (AP)\nare adopted for model evaluation. We compare the different variants with our\nbaseline model. Since there is no public algorithm for RQA, we further compare\nour results with those obtained from a website that can score a resume.\nExperimental results in terms of different criteria demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

Instead, weaker forms of supervision that provide noisier but cheaper\nlabels are often used. However, these weak supervision sources have diverse and\nunknown accuracies, may output correlated labels, and may label different tasks\nor apply at different levels of granularity. We propose a framework for\nintegrating and modeling such weak supervision sources by viewing them as\nlabeling different related sub-tasks of a problem, which we refer to as the\nmulti-task weak supervision setting.

We demonstrate that vitrimers can self-assemble into complex meso-\nand nanostructures when crosslinks and backbone monomers strongly interact.\nVitrimers featuring polyethylene (PE) as the backbone and dioxaborolane\nmaleimide as the crosslinkable moiety were studied in both the molten and\nsemi-crystalline states. We observed that PE vitrimers macroscopically phase\nseparated into dioxaborolane maleimide rich and poor regions, and characterized\nthe extent of phase separation by optical transmission measurements.

The\nshape, size and texture features of nuclei in tissue are important biomarkers\nfor disease prognosis, and accurate computation of these features depends on\naccurate delineation of boundaries of nuclei. Input parameters in many nucleus\nsegmentation workflows affect segmentation accuracy and have to be tuned for\noptimal performance. This is a time-consuming and computationally expensive\nprocess; automating this step facilitates more robust image segmentation\nworkflows and enables more efficient application of image analysis in large\nimage datasets. Our software platform adjusts the parameters of a nuclear\nsegmentation algorithm to maximize the quality of image segmentation results\nwhile minimizing the execution time.

In addition, the methodology is\ndeveloped to execute on high performance computing systems to reduce the\nexecution time of the parameter tuning phase.

For learning robust person features, the pose variation of person\nimages is one of the key challenges. Existing works targeting the problem\neither perform human alignment, or learn human-region-based representations.\nExtra pose information and computational cost is generally required for\ninference. To solve this issue, a Feature Distilling Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (FD-GAN) is proposed for learning identity-related and pose-unrelated\nrepresentations. It is a novel framework based on a Siamese structure with\nmultiple novel discriminators on human poses and identities. In addition to the\ndiscriminators, a novel same-pose loss is also integrated, which requires\nappearance of a same person's generated images to be similar. After learning\npose-unrelated person features with pose guidance, no auxiliary pose\ninformation and additional computational cost is required during testing.

This task enables many potential applications such as\nquestion answering and paraphrase identification.

CSRAN is a deep architecture, involving stacked (multi-layered)\nrecurrent encoders. Stacked/Deep architectures are traditionally difficult to\ntrain, due to the inherent weaknesses such as difficulty with feature\npropagation and vanishing gradients. CSRAN incorporates two novel components to\ntake advantage of the stacked architecture. Firstly, it introduces a new\nbidirectional alignment mechanism that learns affinity weights by fusing\nsequence pairs across stacked hierarchies. Secondly, it leverages a multi-level\nattention refinement component between stacked recurrent layers. The key\nintuition is that, by leveraging information across all network hierarchies, we\ncan not only improve gradient flow but also improve overall performance. We\nconduct extensive experiments on six well-studied text sequence matching\ndatasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 05:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

The present article presents new theoretical quantum chemical\ncomputations on possible NH2CHO formation routes in water-rich amorphous ices,\nsimulated by a 33-H2O-molecule cluster.

Our calculations show that formamide can indeed be formed, but in\ncompetition with formation of NH3 and CO through a direct H transfer process.\nThe final outcome of the NH2 + HCO reactivity depends on the relative\norientation of the two radicals on the ice surface. We then analyzed two other\npossibilities, suggested here for the first time: reaction of either HCN or CN\nwith water molecules of the ice mantle. The reaction with HCN has been found to\nbe characterized by large energy barriers and, therefore, cannot occur under\nthe interstellar ice conditions. On the contrary, the reaction with the CN\nradical can occur, possibly leading through multiple steps to the formation of\nNH2CHO. For this reaction, water molecules of the ice act as catalytic active\nsites since they help the H transfers involved in the process, thus reducing\nthe energy barriers (compared to the gas-phase analogous reaction).\nAdditionally, we apply a statistical model to estimate the reaction rate\ncoefficient when considering the cluster of 33-H2O-molecules as an isolated\nmoiety with respect to the surrounding environment, i.e., the rest of the ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 09:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Most redundancy schemes are not completely effective for providing\nhigh availability, durability and integrity in the long-term. We propose alpha\nentanglement codes, a mechanism that creates a virtual layer of highly\ninterconnected storage devices to propagate redundant information across a\nlarge scale storage system. Our motivation is to design flexible and practical\nerasure codes with high fault-tolerance to improve data durability and\navailability even in catastrophic scenarios. By flexible and practical, we mean\ncode settings that can be adapted to future requirements and practical\nimplementations with reasonable trade-offs between security, resource usage and\nperformance. The codes have three parameters. Alpha increases storage overhead\nlinearly but increases the possible paths to recover data exponentially. Two\nother parameters increase fault-tolerance even further without the need of\nadditional storage. As a result, an entangled storage system can provide high\navailability, durability and offer additional integrity: it is more difficult\nto modify data undetectably. We evaluate how several redundancy schemes perform\nin unreliable environments and show that alpha entanglement codes are flexible\nand practical codes. Remarkably, they excel at code locality, hence, they\nreduce repair costs and become less dependent on storage locations with poor\navailability. Our solution outperforms Reed-Solomon codes in many disaster\nrecovery scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 10:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

We investigate both monopolar and quadrupolar continuous\ngravitational radiation from neutron stars deformed through internal magnetic\nstresses. We adopt the Parameterised-Post-Newtonian formalism to write down\nequations describing the leading-order stellar properties in a\ntheory-independent way, and derive some exact solutions for stars with mixed\npoloidal-toroidal magnetic fields.

These works ignore the number of collisions in the network leading to\nwastage of power and bring down the effective life of battery operated SUs. In\nthis paper, we develop algorithms for OSA that learn faster and incurs fewer\nnumber of collisions i.e. energy efficient.

The\nanalysis shows that when all the SUs independently implement the proposed\nalgorithms, the loss in throughput compared to the optimal throughput, i.e.\nregret, is a constant with high probability and significantly outperforms\nexisting algorithms both in terms of regret and number of collisions. Fewer\ncollisions make them ideally suitable for battery operated SU terminals.

In\nthis paper we develop a robust estimation procedure for the parametric Cox\nregression model based on the minimum density power divergence approach. The\nproposed minimum density power divergence estimator is seen to produce highly\nrobust estimates under data contamination with only a slight loss in efficiency\nunder pure data. Further, they are always seen to generate more precise\ninference than the likelihood based estimates under the semi-parametric Cox\nmodels or their existing robust versions. We also sketch the derivation of the\nasymptotic properties of the proposed estimator using the martingale approach\nand justify their robustness theoretically through the influence function\nanalysis. The practical applicability and usefulness of the proposal are\nillustrated through simulations and a real data example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 12:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

At one\nextreme, each node knows the demands of only its neighbors; at the other\nextreme, there exists an optimal, centralized scheduler that has global\ninformation. The present work interpolates between these two extremes by\nquantifying the tradeoff between the degree of decentralization and the\nperformance of the distributed algorithm. This open problem is resolved for the\nprimary interference model, and the following general result is obtained: if\neach node knows the demands of all links in a ball of radius $d$ centered at\nthe node, then there is a distributed algorithm whose performance is away from\nthat of an optimal, centralized algorithm by a factor of at most\n$(2d+3)/(2d+2)$.

An additional challenge is learning an interpretable model that not\nonly accurately predicts outcomes, but also identifies important factors\nassociated with a given behavior. To address these challenges, we describe a\nstatistical approach to modeling behavioral data called the structured\nsum-of-squares decomposition (S3D). The algorithm, which is inspired by\ndecision trees, selects important features that collectively explain the\nvariation of the outcome, quantifies correlations between the features, and\npartitions the subspace of important features into smaller, more homogeneous\nblocks that correspond to similarly-behaving subgroups within the population.\nThis partitioned subspace allows us to predict and analyze the behavior of the\noutcome variable both statistically and visually, giving a medium to examine\nthe effect of various features and to create explainable predictions.
