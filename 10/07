However, it is not\nclear how we can either qualitatively identify the prosumer with the most\nimpact potential or quantitatively estimate each prosumer's contribution to the\ntotal social welfare improvement when additional resource capacity/flexibility\nis introduced to the system with demand response, such as allowing net-selling\nbehavior. In this work, we build upon existing literature on the electricity\nmarket, which consists of price-taking prosumers each with various appliances,\nan electric utility company and a social welfare optimizing distribution system\noperator, to design a general sensitivity analysis approach (GSAA) that can\nestimate the potential of each consumer's contribution to the social welfare\nwhen given more resource capacity. GSAA is based on existence of an efficient\ncompetitive equilibrium, which we establish in the paper. When prosumers'\nutility functions are quadratic, GSAA can give closed forms characterization on\nsocial welfare improvement based on duality analysis. Furthermore, we extend\nGSAA to a general convex settings, i.e., utility functions with strong\nconvexity and Lipschitz continuous gradient. Even without knowing the specific\nforms the utility functions, we can derive upper and lower bounds of the social\nwelfare improvement potential of each prosumer, when extra resource is\nintroduced. For both settings, several applications and numerical examples are\nprovided: including extending AC comfort zone, ability of EV to discharge and\nnet selling. The estimation results show that GSAA can be used to decide how to\nallocate potentially limited market resources in the most impactful way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 07:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

This phenomenon results from the counter-rotation between the\nbacterial body and flagella and lateral drags on them in opposite directions\ndue to their proximity to the boundaries. Numerous experimental techniques have\nbeen developed to confine and maneuver motile bacteria. Here, we report\nobservations on Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp. when they are confined\nwithin a thin layer of water around dispersed micrometer-sized particles\nsprinkled over a semi-solid agar gel. In this setting, the flagellated bacteria\norbit around the dispersed particles akin to planetary systems. The liquid\nlayer is shaped like a shallow tent with its height at the center set by the\nseeding particle and the meniscus profile set by the strong surface tension of\nwater. The tent-shaped constraint and the left handedness of the flagellar\nfilaments result in exclusively clockwise circular trajectories. The thin fluid\nlayer is resilient due to a balance between evaporation and reinforcing fluid\npumped out of the agar. The latter is driven by the Laplace pressure caused by\nthe curved meniscus. This novel mechanism to entrap bacteria within a minimal\nvolume of fluid is relevant to near surface bacterial accumulation, adhesion,\nbiofilm growth, development of bio-microdevices, and cleansing hygiene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 16:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Estimating\nthe relative angles, delays, and Doppler shifts from the received signals\nallows to determine the locations and velocities of objects. However, due to\npractical constraints, the probing signals have finite bandwidth B, the\nreceived signals are observed over a finite time interval of length T only, and\na radar typically has only one or a few transmit and receive antennas. These\nconstraints fundamentally limit the resolution up to which objects can be\ndistinguished. Specifically, a radar can not distinguish objects with delay and\nDoppler shifts much closer than 1/B and 1/T, respectively, and a radar system\nwith N_T transmit and N_R receive antennas cannot distinguish objects with\nangels closer than 1/(N_T N_R). As a consequence, the delay, Doppler, and\nangular resolution of standard radars is proportional to 1/B and 1/T, and\n1/(N_T N_R). In this chapter, we show that the continuous angle-delay-Doppler\ntriplets and the corresponding attenuation factors can be resolved at much\nfiner resolution, using ideas from compressive sensing.

The performance of these approaches are compared to that of the\nempirical influence function in simulations across different levels of\npositivity violations and treatment effect sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 17:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Deep learning techniques are becoming top performers on\nanalyzing such texts. There are however several problems that need to be solved\nfor efficient use of deep neural networks on text mining and text polarity\nanalysis. First, deep neural networks need to be fed with data sets that are\nbig in size as well as properly labeled. Second, there are various\nuncertainties regarding the use of word embedding vectors: should they be\ngenerated from the same data set that is used to train the model or it is\nbetter to source them from big and popular collections? Third, to simplify\nmodel creation it is convenient to have generic neural network architectures\nthat are effective and can adapt to various texts, encapsulating much of design\ncomplexity. This thesis addresses the above problems to provide methodological\nand practical insights for utilizing neural networks on sentiment analysis of\ntexts and achieving state of the art results. Regarding the first problem, the\neffectiveness of various crowdsourcing alternatives is explored and two\nmedium-sized and emotion-labeled song data sets are created utilizing social\ntags. To address the second problem, a series of experiments with large text\ncollections of various contents and domains were conducted, trying word\nembeddings of various parameters. Regarding the third problem, a series of\nexperiments involving convolution and max-pooling neural layers were conducted.\nCombining convolutions of words, bigrams, and trigrams with regional\nmax-pooling layers in a couple of stacks produced the best results. The derived\narchitecture achieves competitive performance on sentiment polarity analysis of\nmovie, business and product reviews.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2018 17:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

However, placing edge\nservice in every possible edge site by an ASP is practically infeasible due to\nthe ASP's prohibitive budget requirement. In this paper, we investigate the\nedge service placement problem of an ASP under a limited budget, where the ASP\ndynamically rents computing/storage resources in edge sites to host its\napplications in close proximity to end users. Since the benefit of placing edge\nservice in a specific site is usually unknown to the ASP a priori, optimal\nplacement decisions must be made while learning this benefit. We pose this\nproblem as a novel combinatorial contextual bandit learning problem. It is\n\"combinatorial\" because only a limited number of edge sites can be rented to\nprovide the edge service given the ASP's budget. It is \"contextual\" because we\nutilize user context information to enable finer-grained learning and decision\nmaking. To solve this problem and optimize the edge computing performance, we\npropose SEEN, a Spatial-temporal Edge sErvice placemeNt algorithm. Furthermore,\nSEEN is extended to scenarios with overlapping service coverage by\nincorporating a disjunctively constrained knapsack problem. In both cases, we\nprove that our algorithm achieves a sublinear regret bound when it is compared\nto an oracle algorithm that knows the exact benefit information. Simulations\nare carried out on a real-world dataset, whose results show that SEEN\nsignificantly outperforms benchmark solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 01:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

For an\nundirected graph, 3-node graphlets include close triangle and open triangle.\nWhen k = 4, there are six types of graphlets, e.g., tailed-triangle and clique\nare two possible 4-node graphlets. The number of each graphlet, called graphlet\ncount, is a signature which characterizes the local network structure of a\ngiven graph. Graphlet count plays a prominent role in network analysis of many\nfields, most notably bioinformatics and social science.\n  However, computing exact graphlet count is inherently difficult and\ncomputational expensive because the number of graphlets grows exponentially\nlarge as the graph size and/or graphlet size k grow. To deal with this\ndifficulty, many sampling methods were proposed to estimate graphlet count with\nbounded error. Nevertheless, these methods require large number of samples to\nbe statistically reliable, which is still computationally demanding. Moreover,\nthey have to repeat laborious counting procedure even if a new graph is similar\nor exactly the same as previous studied graphs.\n  Intuitively, learning from historic graphs can make estimation more accurate\nand avoid many repetitive counting to reduce computational cost. Based on this\nidea, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework and two\npreprocessing techniques to estimate graphlet count. Extensive experiments on\ntwo types of random graphs and real world biochemistry graphs show that our\nframework can offer substantial speedup on estimating graphlet count of new\ngraphs with high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 03:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

The frequency of species that survive multiple\nexistential threats would likely obey a power law such as Lotka's Law, such\nthat the frequency of survivors would diminish as an inverse power of the\nnumber of threats. Since any species that advances to the point at which it is\ndetectable on an interstellar scale likely must survive a large number of\nexistential threats, by Lotka's Law the number of such survivors would be a\nvery small fraction of the candidate species that evolve on various planets.\nSome sobering implications of this picture are outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 05:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Groups are typically the size of\ngalaxy-cluster cores, but have masses typically only a few times that of a\nsingle galaxy. Accelerations in groups get far below those in galaxies, and far\nbelow the MOND acceleration. So much so, that many groups might be affected by\nthe external-field effect, which is unique to MOND, due to background\naccelerations. Here, I analyze the MOND dynamics of 53 galaxy groups, recently\ncatalogued in 3 lists. Their Newtonian, K-band, dynamical $M/L$ ratios are a\nfew tens to several hundreds solar units, with $\\langle{M_d/L_K}\\rangle= (56,\n25, 30)~M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$, respectively for the 3 lists; thus evincing very\nlarge acceleration discrepancies. I find here that MOND requires dynamical\n$M_M/L_K$ values of order $1~M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$, with\n$\\langle{M_M/L_K}\\rangle=(0.8, 0.56, 1.0) ~M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$, for the 3\nlists, which are in good agreement with population-synthesis stellar values,\nand with those found in individual galaxies. MOND thus accounts for the\nobserved dynamics in those groups with baryons alone, and no need for dark\nmatter -- an important extension of MOND analysis from galaxies to galactic\nsystems, which, to boot, have characteristic sizes of several hundred\nkiloparsecs, and accelerations much lower than probed before -- only a few\npercent of MOND's $a_0$. The acceleration discrepancies evinced by these groups\nthus conform to the deep-MOND prediction: $g\\approx (g_Na_0)^{1/2}$, down to\nthese very low accelerations ($g$ is the measured, and $g_N$ the baryonic,\nNewtonian acceleration).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 06:14:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 19:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

Based on the variational principle, transport coefficients such\nas the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion are calculated by\nthe FSM, which compare well with analytical solutions. Then, we apply the FSM\nto find the accurate transport coefficients through an iterative scheme for the\nlinearized quantum Boltzmann equation. The shear viscosity and thermal\nconductivity of the three-dimensional quantum Fermi and Bose gases interacting\nthrough hard-sphere potential are calculated. For Fermi gas, the relative\ndifference between the accurate and variational transport coefficients\nincreases with the fugacity; for Bose gas, the relative difference in the\nthermal conductivity has similar behavior as the gas moves from the classical\nto the degenerate limits, but that in the shear viscosity decreases. Finally,\nthe shear viscosity and diffusion coefficient have also been calculated for a\ntwo-dimensional equal-mole mixture of Fermi gases.

The behavior is anisotropic in k-space; accordingly the roton\ninstabilities occur first in the $k_y$ direction, suggestive of inhomogeneity\nand stripe phase, with density mode becoming soft in the $y$-direction.

For the purpose of stability, we consider the von Neumann\nstability analysis method for uniform grids with a periodic boundary condition.\nIn addition, the combined-mode analysis approach previously introduced for the\nwave equation is utilized to analyze the dissipative error. This new approach\ncan be used to study the performance of a particular DG and Runge-Kutta DG\n(RKDG) scheme for the entire extended wavenumber range. Thus, more insights\ninto the robustness as well as accuracy and efficiency can be obtained. For\ninstance, the LDG method provides larger dissipation for high-wavenumber\ncomponents than the BR1 and BR2 approaches for short time simulations in\naddition to a lower error bound for long time simulations. The BR1 approach\nwith added dissipation can have desirable properties and stability similar to\nBR2. For BR2, the penalty parameter can be adjusted to enhance the performance\nof the scheme. The results are verified through canonical numerical tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 07:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

The flagellum rotates about the head at a\ncontrolled angular velocity and generates a propulsive force that moves the\nrobot forward. When the angular velocity exceeds a threshold value, the\nhydrodynamic force exerted by the fluid can cause the soft flagellum to buckle,\ncharacterized by a dramatic change in shape. In this computational study, a\nfluid-structure interaction model that combines Discrete Elastic Rods (DER)\nalgorithm with Lighthill's Slender Body Theory (LSBT) is employed to simulate\nthe locomotion and deformation of the robot. We demonstrate that the robot can\nfollow a prescribed path in three dimensional space by exploiting buckling of\nthe flagellum. The control scheme involves only a single (binary) scalar input\n-- the angular velocity of the flagellum. By triggering the buckling\ninstability at the right moment, the robot can follow an arbitrary path in\nthree dimensional space. We also show that the complexity of the dynamics of\nthe helical filament can be captured using a deep neural network, from which we\nidentify the input-output functional relationship between the control inputs\nand the trajectory of the robot. Furthermore, our study underscores the\npotential role of buckling in the locomotion of natural bacteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 09:34:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 02:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Considering that the underwater\nacoustic waves propagate along bent curves at varying speeds in practice, it\nbecomes much more challenging to determine a proper anchor deployment\nconfiguration. In this paper, taking the practical variability of underwater\nsound speed into account, we investigate the anchor-AUV geometry problem in a\n3-D time-of-flight (ToF) based underwater scenario from the perspective of\nlocalization accuracy. To address this problem, we first rigorously derive the\nJacobian matrix of measurement errors to quantify the Cramer-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB) with a widely-adopted isogradient sound speed profile (SSP). We then\nformulate an optimization problem that minimizes the trace of the CRLB subject\nto the angle and range constraints to figure out the anchor-AUV geometry, which\nis multivariate and nonlinear and thus generally hard to handle. For\nmathematical tractability, by adopting tools from the estimation theory, we\ninterestingly find that this problem can be equivalently transformed into a\nmore explicit univariate optimization problem. By this, we obtain an\neasy-to-implement anchor-AUV geometry that yields satisfactory localization\nperformance, referred to as the uniform sea-surface circumference (USC)\ndeployment. Extensive simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and\nshow that our proposed USC scheme outperforms both the cube and the random\ndeployment schemes in terms of localization accuracy under the same parameter\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 09:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

This is a symmetry\nbreaking task called rendezvous, equivalent to the fundamental task of leader\nelection between the agents. When is this feasible in a completely anonymous\nenvironment? It is known that agents can always meet if their initial positions\nare nonsymmetric, and that if they are symmetric and agents start\nsimultaneously then rendezvous is impossible. What happens for symmetric\ninitial positions with non-simultaneous start? Can symmetry between the agents\nbe broken by the delay between their starting times?\n  In order to answer these questions, we consider {\\em space-time initial\nconfigurations} (abbreviated by STIC). A STIC is formalized as\n$[(u,v),\\delta]$, where $u$ and $v$ are initial nodes of the agents in some\ngraph and $\\delta$ is a non-negative integer that represents the difference\nbetween their starting times.

Several previous studies have suggested that the prompt emission\nspectrum of GRBs is likely to consist of a few components that may arise from\ndifferent jet compositions. Here we present a systematic analysis to search for\nthe GRBs that seem to show the transition from a fireball to the\nPoynting-flux-dominated outflow between well-separated pulses within a single\nburst, like the GRB 160626B, using the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the\n\\emph{Fermi} satellite. We obtain 43 GRBs with clear multiple pulses and find\nthat 9/43 (21\\%) bursts may exhibit such a transition based on the\ntime-integrated spectral analysis. We then select a further four bursts with\nthe data of adequate quality to perform a detailed time-resolved spectral\nanalysis, and we find that in three bursts the thermal-like pulse is a\nprecursor. Furthermore, based on the time-resolved spectra, we constrain the\noutflow properties for those thermal pulses and find them consistent with the\ntypical properties of the photosphere emission. Also, the later pulses with the\nsofter low-energy spectral index are compatible with the optically thin\nsynchrotron emission model. Our analysis indicates that a good fraction of the\nmultipulse {\\it Fermi} bursts may obtain the transition from fireball to the\nPoynting-flux-dominated outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 12:18:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 17:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 22:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 23:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

Most\nregularization strategies only work for data where all predictors are treated\nidentically, such as Lasso regression for (continuous) predictors treated as\nlinear effects. However, many predictive problems involve different types of\npredictors and require a tailored regularization term. We propose a multi-type\nLasso penalty that acts on the objective function as a sum of subpenalties, one\nfor each type of predictor. As such, we allow for predictor selection and level\nfusion within a predictor in a data-driven way, simultaneous with the parameter\nestimation process. We develop a new estimation strategy for convex predictive\nmodels with this multi-type penalty. Using the theory of proximal operators,\nour estimation procedure is computationally efficient, partitioning the overall\noptimization problem into easier to solve subproblems, specific for each\npredictor type and its associated penalty. Earlier research applies\napproximations to non-differentiable penalties to solve the optimization\nproblem. The proposed SMuRF algorithm removes the need for approximations and\nachieves a higher accuracy and computational efficiency.

We propose a novel approach that assesses the translated output\nbased on the source text rather than the reference translation, and measures\nthe extent to which the semantics of the discourse elements (discourse\nrelations, in particular) in the source text are preserved in the MT output.\nThe challenge is to detect the discourse relations in the source text and\ndetermine whether these relations are correctly transferred crosslingually to\nthe target language -- without a reference translation. This methodology could\nbe used independently for discourse-level evaluation, or as a component in\nother metrics, at a time where substantial amounts of MT are online and would\nbenefit from evaluation where the source text serves as a benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 14:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Classical nucleation theory (CNT) assumes that\nhomogeneous nucleation occurs via random fluctuations within the supercooled\nliquid, that the structure of the growing clusters resembles the most stable\nbulk phase, and that the nucleus size is the sole reaction coordinate (RC) of\nthe process. Many materials are, however, known to exhibit multiple steps\nduring crystallization, forming different polymorphs.

In this work, we employ transition path sampling together with a\nmaximum likelihood analysis of candidate order parameters to identify suitable\nreaction coordinates for the nucleation mechanism during solidification in Ni.\nIn contrast to CNT, the analysis of the reweighted path ensemble shows that a\npre-structured liquid region that surrounds the crystal cluster is a relevant\norder parameter that enhances the RC and therefore plays a key role in the\ndescription of the growing nucleus and the interfacial free energy. We\ndemonstrate that pre-structured liquid clusters that emerge within the liquid\nact as precursors of the crystallization in a non-classical two-step mechanism\nwhich predetermines the coordination of the polymorphs that are being selected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 14:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

In addition to the more\nconventional Application Specific Photonic Circuit (ASPIC) paradigm the\nProgrammable Multifunctional Nanophotonics (PMN) approach is a transversal\nconcept inspired by similar approaches, which are already employed in other\ntechnology fields. For instance, in electronics Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA) devices enable a much more flexible universal operation as compared to\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).In photonics, the (PMN)\nconcept is enabled by two dimensional (2D) waveguide meshes for which, the\nnumber of possible input and output ports quickly builds up and furthermore,\ninternal signal flow paths make the computation of transfer functions an\nintractable problem.

However, it has not been fully\nsolved yet. From the mid of the twentieth century when Bardeen, Cooper and\nSchrieffer constructed their theory it has been believed that a superconducting\ngap is a collective phenomenon of electron excitations. In this work it is\ndemonstrated that according to translation-invariant bipolaron theory of HTSC\nthe different types of experiments measure for the gap different values. Thus\ntunneling experiments determine the bipolaron energy for a superconducting gap.\nOn the other hand, the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy method\nmeasures the phonon frequency for which the electron-phonon interaction is\nmaximum. Such effects as kinks in spectral measurements of gap, its angular\ndependence, existence of pseudogap and others have got natural explanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 13:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

Cation adsorption/desorption is often proposed to\noccur in concert with proton-transfer on hydroxyl-covered mineral surfaces, but\nso far this cooperative effect has been inferred indirectly. This work applies\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT)-based molecular dynamics simulations of\nexplicit liquid water/mineral interfaces to calculate metal ion desorption free\nenergies. Monodentate adsorption of Na(+), Mg(2+), and Cu(2+) on partially\ndeprotonated silica surfaces are considered. Na(+) is predicted to be unbound,\nwhile Cu(2+) exhibits larger binding free energies to surface SiO(-) groups\nthan Mg(2+). The predicted trends agree with competitive adsorption\nmeasurements on fumed silica surfaces. As desorption proceeds, Cu(2+)\ndissociates one of the H2O molecules in its first solvation shell, turning into\nCu(2+)O(-)(H2O)(3), while Mg remains Mg(2+)(H2O)(6). The protonation state of\nthe SiO(-) group at the initial binding site does not vary monotonically with\ncation desorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2018 00:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}
