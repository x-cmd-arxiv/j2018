Relativistic electrons\nand positrons traveling in interstellar space lose energy much more rapidly\nthan more massive particles such as protons and nuclei, with a rate that grows\nquadratically with the particle energy $E$. One therefore expects that the\neffects of energy loss should leave observable signatures in the $e^\\mp$\nspectra, in the form of softenings centered at the critical energy $E^*$. This\nquantity is determined by the condition that the total energy loss suffered by\nparticles during their residence time in the Galaxy is of the same order of the\ninitial energy. If the electrons and positrons are accelerated in discrete\n(quasi) point--like astrophysical objects, such as Supernova explosions or\nPulsars, the stochastic nature of the sources should also leave observable\nsignatures in the $e^\\mp$ energy spectra and angular distributions above a\nsecond (higher) critical energy $E^\\dagger$, determined by the condition that\nparticles with $E \\gtrsim E^\\dagger$ can propagate only for a maximum distance\nshorter than the average separation between sources. In this work we discuss\nthe theoretically expectations for the signatures of the energy loss effects on\nthe electron and positron spectra, and compare these predictions with the\nexisting observations. Recent measurements of the $(e^- + e^+$) flux have\ndiscovered the existence of a prominent spectral break at $E \\simeq 1$~TeV.\nThis spectral feature can perhaps be identified with the critical energy $E^*$.\nAn alternative hypothesis is to assmume that $E^*$ has a much lower value of\norder few GeV.

It is still largely unknown\nwhether optimizing spike train similarity of highly recurrent SNNs produces\nweight matrices similar to those of the ground truth model.

Age of\nInformation (AoI) is a newly proposed metric that effectively captures this\nrequirement. Recent research on the subject has derived AoI optimal policies\nfor the generation of status updates and AoI optimal packet queueing\ndisciplines.

The nature of dark matter is\ncurrently unknown, with the mass of possible constituents spanning nearly one\nhundred orders of magnitude. The ultralight scalar field dark matter,\nconsisting of extremely light bosons with $m \\sim 10^{-22}$ eV and often called\n\"fuzzy\" dark matter, provides intriguing solutions to some challenges at\nsub-Galactic scales for the standard cold dark matter model. As shown by\nKhmelnitsky and Rubakov, such a scalar field in the Galaxy would produce an\noscillating gravitational potential with nanohertz frequencies, resulting in\nperiodic variations in the times of arrival of radio pulses from pulsars. The\nParkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) has been monitoring 20 millisecond pulsars at\ntwo to three weeks intervals for more than a decade. In addition to the\ndetection of nanohertz gravitational waves, PPTA offers the opportunity for\ndirect searches for fuzzy dark matter in an astrophysically feasible range of\nmasses. We analyze the latest PPTA data set which includes timing observations\nfor 26 pulsars made between 2004 and 2016. We perform a search in this data set\nfor evidence of ultralight dark matter in the Galaxy using Bayesian and\nFrequentist methods. No statistically significant detection has been made.

A locally\nrefined, near the individual turbines, background unstructured Cartesian grid\nenables LES across a range of geometric scales of relevance spanning\napproximately five orders of magnitude.

The arc-support\ngroups are formed by iteratively and robustly linking the arc-support line\nsegments that latently belong to a common ellipse. Afterward, two complementary\napproaches, namely, locally selecting the arc-support group with higher\nsaliency and globally searching all the valid paired groups, are adopted to fit\nthe initial ellipses in a fast way. Then, the ellipse candidate set can be\nformulated by hierarchical clustering of 5D parameter space of initial\nellipses. Finally, the salient ellipse candidates are selected and refined as\ndetections subject to the stringent and effective verification. Extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets are implemented and our method achieves\nthe best F-measure scores compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

We minimized the downtime caused by the intervention\nthreshold when a node switches to the Unhealthy state by fitting various\nheavy-tail probability distributions. We consider using features of the node to\ncustomize the organic recovery model to the individual nodes that go unhealthy.\nThis regression approach allows us to use information about the node like\nhardware, software versions, historical performance indicators, etc. to inform\nthe organic recovery model and hence the optimal threshold. In another\ndirection, we consider generalizing this to an arbitrary number of thresholds\nwithin the node state machine (or Markov chain). When the states become\nintertwined in ways that different thresholds start affecting each other, we\ncan't simply optimize each of them in isolation. For best results, we must\nconsider this as an optimization problem in many variables (the number of\nthresholds). We no longer have a nice closed form solution for this more\ncomplex problem like we did with one threshold, but we can still use numerical\ntechniques (gradient descent) to solve it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 06:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

In the discrete element method (DEM) contact friction is\nusually modelled with Coulomb's law assuming a constant interparticle friction\ncoefficient. From tribology it is known that friction is influenced by several\nfactors, e.g., temperature, normal stress, surface condition, etc. None of\nthese influences can be modelled with the constant interparticle friction\ncoefficient from Coulomb's law. For a given granular material (particle shape\ndistribution), the usage of constant interparticle friction in DEM models\ngenerally results in constant bulk friction coefficients in the simulation of\ndirect shear tests. While this is frequently seen in experiments with\nequi-sized spherical particles, papers exist in literature which report a\nstress dependency of bulk friction for non-spherical particles of certain\nmaterials. In this work, a stress dependency of bulk friction is obtained by\nintroducing a model for stress dependent interparticle friction in DEM\nsimulations. For validation experimental results of direct shear tests\nconducted on single or paired glass beads are used. While the bulk friction of\npaired spheres clearly decreases with increasing normal stress, it is nearly\nconstant for single spheres. DEM simulations with the stress dependent\ninterparticle friction are in good accordance with the experimental results of\nboth single and paired spheres. A comparison with simulations, using constant\ninterparticle friction, clearly shows the advantage of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 08:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

The feature of these orbital parameters is used to constrain\nthe evolutionary processes of progenitor binaries and the supernova (SN) kicks\nof the second born NSs. Adopting that the mass transfer during primordial\nbinary evolution is highly non-conservative (rotation-dependent), the formation\nof DNS systems involves a double helium star binary phase, the common envelope\n(CE) evolution initiates before the first NS formation. During the CE evolution\nthe binary orbital energy is obviously larger when using a helium star rather\nthan a NS to expel the donor envelope, this can help explain the formation of\nDNS systems with long periods. SN kicks at NS birth can lead to eccentric\norbits and even the disruption of binary systems, the low eccentricities\nrequire that the DNSs receive a small natal kick at the second collapse.\nCompared with the overall distribution of orbital parameters for observed DNS\nbinaries, we propose that the second born NSs in most DNS systems are subject\nto small natal kicks with the Maxwellian dispersion velocity of less than $ 80\n\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1} $, which can provide some constraints on the SN explosion\nprocesses. The mass distribution of DNS binaries is also briefly discussed.

We show that nanocrystalline\nboundaries degrade the thermal conductivity more drastically when the average\ngrain size becomes smaller than the average phonon mean free path. The\nintroduction of pores degrades the thermal conductivity even further. Its\neffect, however, is significantly more severe when the pore sizes and positions\nare randomized, as randomization results in regions of higher porosity along\nthe phonon transport direction, which introduce significant thermal resistance.\nWe show that randomization acts as a large increase in the overall effective\nporosity. Using our simulations, we show that existing compact nanocrystalline\nand nanoporous theoretical models describe thermal conductivity accurately\nunder uniform nanostructured conditions, but overestimate it in randomized\ngeometries. We propose extensions to these models that accurately predict the\nthermal conductivity of randomized nanoporous materials based solely on a few\ngeometrical features. Finally, we show that the new compact models introduced\ncan be used within Matthiessens rule to combine scattering from different\ngeometrical features within approximately 10 per cent accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 09:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

We aim to contribute to the\nstudy of local bursts by reporting the case of GRB 171205A. This source was\ndiscovered by Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on 2017, December 5 and soon\nassociated with a low redshift host galaxy (z=0.037), and an emerging SN (SN\n2017iuk). We analyzed the full Swift, dataset, comprising the UV-Optical\nTelescope (UVOT), X-ray Telescope (XRT) and BAT data. In addition, we employed\nthe Konus-Wind high energy data as a valuable extension at gamma-ray energies.\nThe photometric SN signature is clearly visible in the UVOT u, b and v filters.\nThe maximum emission is reached at ~ 13 (rest frame) days, and the whole bump\nresembles that of SN 2006aj, but lower in magnitude and with a shift in time of\n+2 d. A prebump in the v-band is also clearly visible, and this is the first\ntime that such a feature is not observed achromatically in GRB-SNe. Its\nphysical origin cannot be easily explained. The X-ray spectrum shows an\nintrinsic Hydrogen column density N_H,int = 7.4(+4.1 -3.6) X 10^20 / cm^2$,\nwhich is at the low end of the N_H,int, even considering just low redshift\nGRBs.

Combining this value\nwith the peak energy in the same band, E_p=125(+141 -37) keV, implies that GRB\n171205A is an outlier of the Amati relation, as are some other low redshift\nGRBs, and its emission mechanism should be different from that of canonical,\nfarther away GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 09:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Processing such phenomena is\nessential in understanding a speaker's intended meaning and controlling the\nflow of the conversation. Furthermore, this processing needs to be word-by-word\nincremental to allow further downstream processing to begin as early as\npossible in order to handle real spontaneous human conversational behaviour.\n  In addition, from a developer's point of view, it is highly desirable to be\nable to develop systems which can be trained from `clean' examples while also\nable to generalise to the very diverse disfluent variations on the same data --\nthereby enhancing both data-efficiency and robustness. In this paper, we\npresent a multi-task LSTM-based model for incremental detection of disfluency\nstructure, which can be hooked up to any component for incremental\ninterpretation (e.g. an incremental semantic parser), or else simply used to\n`clean up' the current utterance as it is being produced.\n  We train the system on the Switchboard Dialogue Acts (SWDA) corpus and\npresent its accuracy on this dataset. Our model outperforms prior neural\nnetwork-based incremental approaches by about 10 percentage points on SWDA\nwhile employing a simpler architecture. To test the model's generalisation\npotential, we evaluate the same model on the bAbI+ dataset, without any\nadditional training. bAbI+ is a dataset of synthesised goal-oriented dialogues\nwhere we control the distribution of disfluencies and their types. This shows\nthat our approach has good generalisation potential, and sheds more light on\nwhich types of disfluency might be amenable to domain-general processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 09:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

We find that\nmost LVC-BC and NC line ratios are explained by thermally excited gas with\ntemperatures between 5,000$-$10,000 K and electron densities\n$\\sim10^{7}-10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$. The HVC ratios are better reproduced by shock\nmodels with a pre-shock H number density of $\\sim10^{6}-10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$.\nUsing these physical properties, we estimate $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nacc}$ for the LVC and $\\dot{M}_{\\rm jet}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ for the HVC. In\nagreement with previous work, the mass carried out in jets is modest compared\nto the accretion rate. With the likely assumption that the NC wind height is\nlarger than the BC, the LVC-BC $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ is found\nto be higher than the LVC-NC. These results suggest that most of the mass loss\noccurs close to the central star, within a few au, through an MHD driven wind.\nDepending on the wind height, MHD winds might play a major role in the\nevolution of the disk mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 11:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

These growing planets undergo\naccretion heating, which triggers a hot-trail effect that can reverse migration\ndirections, increase eccentricities and prevent resonant captures (Chrenko et\nal. 2017). We study populations of embryos accreting pebbles using Fargo-Thorin\n2D hydrocode.\n  We find that embryos in a disk with high surface density ($\\Sigma_0 =\n990\\,{\\rm g}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$) undergo `unsuccessful' two-body encounters which\ndo not lead to a merger. Only when a 3rd protoplanet arrives to the convergence\nzone, three-body encounters lead to mergers. For a low-viscosity disk ($\\nu =\n5\\times10^{13}\\,{\\rm cm}^2\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$) a massive coorbital is a possible\noutcome, for which a pebble isolation develops and the coorbital is stabilised.\nFor more massive protoplanets ($5\\,M_\\oplus$), the convergence radius is\nlocated further out, in the ice-giant zone. After a series of encounters, there\nis an evolution driven by a dynamical torque of a tadpole region, which is\nsystematically repeated several times, until the coorbital configuration is\ndisrupted and planets merge. This may be a pathway how to solve the problem\nthat coorbitals often form in simulations but they are not observed in nature.\n  In contrast, the joint evolution of 120 low-mass protoplanets\n($0.1\\,M_\\oplus$) reveals completely different dynamics. The evolution is no\nlonger smooth, but rather a random walk. This is because the spiral arms,\ndeveloped in the gas disk due to Lindblad resonances, overlap with each other\nand affect not only a single protoplanet but several in the surroundings. Our\nhydrodynamical simulations may have important implications for N-body\nsimulations of planetary migration that use simplified torque prescriptions and\nare thus unable to capture protoplanet dynamics in its full glory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 11:47:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 10:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Yet Breiman (1999) showed a\ndilemma that a uniform improvement on margin distribution does NOT necessarily\nreduces generalization errors. In this paper, we revisit Breiman's dilemma in\ndeep neural networks with recently proposed spectrally normalized margins, from\na novel perspective based on phase transitions of normalized margin\ndistributions in training dynamics. Normalized margin distribution of a\nclassifier over the data, can be divided into two parts: low/small margins such\nas some negative margins for misclassified samples vs. high/large margins for\nhigh confident correctly classified samples, that often behave differently\nduring the training process. Low margins for training and test datasets are\noften effectively reduced in training, along with reductions of training and\ntest errors; while high margins may exhibit different dynamics, reflecting the\ntrade-off between expressive power of models and complexity of data. When data\ncomplexity is comparable to the model expressiveness, high margin distributions\nfor both training and test data undergo similar decrease-increase phase\ntransitions during training. In such cases, one can predict the trend of\ngeneralization or test error by margin-based generalization bounds with\nrestricted Rademacher complexities, shown in two ways in this paper with early\nstopping time exploiting such phase transitions. On the other hand,\nover-expressive models may have both low and high training margins undergoing\nuniform improvements, with a distinct phase transition in test margin dynamics.\nThis reconfirms the Breiman's dilemma associated with overparameterized neural\nnetworks where margins fail to predict overfitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 12:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 13:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2021 14:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Absorption spectra of quasars exhibiting\ntransmission in the He II Ly$\\alpha$ forest provide a unique opportunity to\nmake precise measurements of the quasar lifetime. Indeed, the size of a\nquasar's He II proximity zone, the region near the quasar itself where its own\nradiation dramatically alters the ionization state of the surrounding\nintergalactic medium (IGM), depends sensitively on its lifetime for $t_{\\rm\nQ}\\lesssim 30$ Myr, comparable to the expected $e$-folding time-scale for SMBH\ngrowth $t_{\\rm S}=45$ Myr.

Hence, it is highly expected to\nlearn effective joint representation by fusing the features of different\nmodalities.

In\nthis paper, we propose to densely integrate the representations by greedily\nstacking multiple shared layers between different modality-specific networks,\nwhich is named as Dense Multimodal Fusion (DMF). The joint representations in\ndifferent shared layers can capture the correlations in different levels, and\nthe connection between shared layers also provides an efficient way to learn\nthe dependence among hierarchical correlations. These two properties jointly\ncontribute to the multiple learning paths in DMF, which results in faster\nconvergence, lower training loss, and better performance.

First, we define the threat model for these attacks: our\nadversary does not need the ability to query the victim model; instead, she\nruns a co-located process on the host machine victim's deep learning (DL)\nsystem is running and passively monitors the accesses of the target functions\nin the shared framework. Second, we introduce DeepRecon, an attack that\nreconstructs the architecture of the victim network by using the internal\ninformation extracted via Flush+Reload, a cache side-channel technique. Once\nthe attacker observes function invocations that map directly to architecture\nattributes of the victim network, the attacker can reconstruct the victim's\nentire network architecture. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that an attacker\ncan accurately reconstruct two complex networks (VGG19 and ResNet50) having\nobserved only one forward propagation. Based on the extracted architecture\nattributes, we also demonstrate that an attacker can build a meta-model that\naccurately fingerprints the architecture and family of the pre-trained model in\na transfer learning setting. From this meta-model, we evaluate the importance\nof the observed attributes in the fingerprinting process. Third, we propose and\nevaluate new framework-level defense techniques that obfuscate our attacker's\nobservations. Our empirical security analysis represents a step toward\nunderstanding the DNNs' vulnerability to cache side-channel attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 14:21:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 05:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 02:13:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 17:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

We consider the synchronous CONGEST distributed\ncomputing model and assume that each node has initial knowledge of itself and\nthe identifiers of its neighbors - the so-called KT1 model - a well-studied\nmodel that also naturally arises in many applications. Recently, it has been\nestablished that one can obtain (almost) singularly optimal algorithms, i.e.,\nalgorithms that have simultaneously optimal time and message complexity (up to\npolylogarithmic factors), for many fundamental problems in the standard KT0\nmodel (where nodes have only local knowledge of themselves and not their\nneighbors). The situation is less clear in the KT1 model. In this paper, we\npresent several new distributed algorithms in the KT1 model that trade off\nbetween time and message complexity.\n  Our distributed algorithms are based on a uniform approach which involves\nconstructing a sparsified spanning subgraph of the original graph - called a\ndanner - that trades off the number of edges with the diameter of the\nsparsifier. In particular, a key ingredient of our approach is a distributed\nrandomized algorithm that, given a graph G and any delta in [0, 1], with high\nprobability constructs a danner that has diameter Otilde(D + n^(1 - delta)) and\nOtilde(min{m, n^(1 + delta)}) edges in Otilde(n^(1 - delta)) rounds while using\nOtilde(min{m, n^(1 + delta)}) messages, where n, m, and D are the number of\nnodes, edges, and the diameter of G, respectively.

(2018) arXiv:1810.02595 make two claims that they argue bring\nthe local measurement and early Universe prediction of H0 into agreement: A)\nthey claim that Gaia DR2 parallax measurements show the geometric calibration\nof the Cepheid distance scale used to measure H0 to be grossly in error and B)\nthat we live near the middle of an enormous void, further biasing the local\nmeasurement of the Hubble constant. We show that the first claim is caused by\nfive erroneous uses of the data: in decreasing order of importance: 1) the use\nof a distance indicator, main sequence fitting of cluster stars, which is\nunrelated to the calibration of Cepheids and therefore has no bearing on\ncurrent measurements of H0; 2) the use of Gaia data for Cepheids that fully\nsaturate the detector, producing unreliable parallaxes; 3) the use of a fixed\nparallax offset which is known to depend on source magnitude and color but\nwhich is derived for sources with extremely different colors and magnitudes; 4)\nignoring the uncertainty in this offset; and 5) ignoring the other geometric\nsources of Cepheid calibration, the distance of the LMC from detached eclipsing\nbinaries and the masers in NGC 4258, which are independent of Milky Way\nparallaxes. Just resolving the first two of these issues by not using unrelated\nor saturated data leads to no inconsistency between Gaia parallaxes and the\ncurrent Cepheid distance scale. The second claim can be refuted 6) because of\nthe increase in chi-squared that the alleged void would entail in SN\nmeasurements in the Hubble flow, and 7) because it would represent a 6 sigma\nfluctuation of cosmic variance between the local and globally measured\nexpansion, requiring us to live in an exceedingly special location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 15:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

These models require configuration-space\nrepresentations that accurately characterize the relevant dynamics.\nWell-established, low-dimensional order parameters for constructing this\nrepresentation have led to widespread application of Markov state models to\nstudy conformational dynamics in biomolecular systems. On the contrary,\napplications to characterize single-molecule diffusion processes have been\nscarce and typically employ system-specific, higher-dimensional order\nparameters to characterize the local solvation state of the molecule. In this\nwork, we propose an automated method for generating a coarse\nconfiguration-space representation, using generic features of solvation\nstructure---the coordination numbers about each particle. To overcome the\ninherent noisy behavior of these low-dimensional observables, we treat the\nfeatures as indicators of an underlying, latent Markov process. The resulting\nhidden Markov models filter the trajectories of each feature into the most\nlikely latent solvation state at each time step. The filtered trajectories are\nthen used to construct a configuration-space discretization, which accurately\ndescribes the diffusion kinetics. The method is validated on a standard model\nfor glassy liquids, where particle jumps between local cages determine the\ndiffusion properties of the system. Not only do the resulting models provide\nquantitatively accurate characterizations of the diffusion constant, but they\nalso reveal a mechanistic description of diffusive jumps, quantifying the\nheterogeneity of local diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 15:27:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In this paper, we\nintroduce a simple iterative regularization path, which follows the dynamics of\na sparse Mirror Descent algorithm or a generalization of Linearized Bregman\nIterations with nonlinear loss. Its performance is competitive to\n\\texttt{glmnet} with a further bias reduction. A path consistency theory is\npresented that under the Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC) and the\nIrrepresentable Condition (IRR), the path will first evolve in a subspace with\nno false positives and reach an estimator that is sign-consistent or of minimax\noptimal $\\ell_2$ error rate. Early stopping regularization is required to\nprevent overfitting.

In this paper, we investigate the implication of the all-electron (AE)\nreconstruction on estimation of the DM-induced electronic transition event\nrates. As a benchmark study, we first calculate the wavefunctions in silicon\nand germanium bulk crystals based on both the AE and pseudo (PS) schemes within\nthe projector augmented wave (PAW) framework, and then make comparisons between\nthe calculated excitation event rates obtained from these two approaches. It\nturns out that in process where large momentum transfer is kinetically allowed,\nthe two calculated event rates can differ by a factor of a few. Such\ndiscrepancies are found to stem from the high-momentum components neglected in\nthe PS scheme. It is thus implied that the correction from the AE wavefunction\nin the core region is necessary for an accurate estimate of the DM-induced\ntransition event rate in semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 15:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 14:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 05:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Nevertheless, SGX is\nvulnerable to several side channel attacks (e.g. page-fault-based attack and\ncache-based attack). In this paper, we explore a new, yet critical side channel\nattack in SGX, interface-based side channel attack, which can infer the\ninformation of the enclave input data. The root cause of the interface-based\nside channel attack is the input dependent interface invocation information\n(e.g., interface information and invocation patterns) which can be observed by\nthe untrusted privilege software can reveal the control flow in the enclave. We\nstudy the methodology which can be used to conduct the interface-based side\nchannel attack. To illustrate the effectiveness of the interface-based\nside-channel attacks, we use our methodology to infer whether tracked web pages\nhave been processed by the SGX-assisted NFV platforms and achieve the accuracy\nof 87.6% and recall of 76.6%. We also identify the packets which belong to the\ntracked web pages, with the accuracy of 67.9%and recall of 71.1%. We finally\npropose some countermeasures to defense the interface-based side channel attack\nin SGX-assisted applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 01:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}
