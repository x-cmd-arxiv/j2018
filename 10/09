One important aspect\nof model based gravitational wave detection, and subsequent estimation of\nsource parameters, are the low level modeling of information related to\nperturbed Kerr black holes. Here, we present new phenomenological methods to\nmodel the analytically understood gravitational wave spectra (quasi-normal mode\nfrequencies), and harmonic structure of Kerr black holes (mixing coefficients\nbetween spherical and spheroidal harmonics). In particular, we present a\ngreedy-multivariate-polynomial (GMVP) regression method and\ngreedy-multivariate-rational (GMVR) regression method for the automated\nmodeling of polynomial and rational functions respectively.

In\nthis problem we are given a pattern $P$ of length $w$ and a text $T$ of length\n$n$ over some alphabet $\\Sigma$, and a positive integer $k$. The goal is to\nfind all the positions $j$ in $T$ such that there is a substring of $T$ ending\nat $j$ which has edit distance at most $k$ from the pattern $P$. Recall, the\nedit distance between two strings is the minimum number of character\ninsertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into\nthe other. For a position $t$ in $\\{1,...,n\\}$, let $k_t$ be the smallest edit\ndistance between $P$ and any substring of $T$ ending at $t$. In this paper we\ngive a constant factor approximation to the sequence $k_1,k_2,...,k_{n}$.

In the absence of magnetic field, we found the temperature dependence\nof $\\chi^*$ to be consistent with Fermi-liquid-based predictions, and to be\nmuch weaker than the power-law, predicted by non-Fermi-liquid models.

Our study focuses on the so-called \"nonarchimedean\nMilnor fiber\" that was introduced by Hrushovski and Loeser, and our thesis is\nthat it is a richer embodiment of the underlying philosophy of the Milnor\nconstruction. The said narrative is first developed in the more natural complex\nenvironment, and is then extended to the real one via descent. In the process\nof doing so, we are able to provide more illuminating new proofs, free of\nresolution of singularities, of a few pivotal results in the literature, both\ncomplex and real. To begin with, the real motivic zeta function is shown to be\nrational, which yields the real motivic Milnor fiber; this is an analogue of\nthe Hrushovski-Loeser construction. We also establish, in a much more intuitive\nmanner, a new Thom-Sebastiani formula, which can be specialized to the one\ngiven by Guibert, Loeser, and Merle. Finally, applying $T$-convex integration\nafter descent, matching the Euler Characteristics of the topological Milnor\nfiber and the motivic Milnor fiber becomes a matter of simple computation,\nwhich is not only free of resolution of singularities as in the\nHrushovski-Loeser proof, but is also free of other sophisticated\nalgebro-geometric machineries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 16:21:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 00:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

In widely-used models of biological contagion,\ninterventions that randomly rewire edges (generally making them \"longer\")\naccelerate spread. However, there are other models relevant to social\ncontagion, such as those motivated by myopic best-response in games with\nstrategic complements, in which an individual's behavior is described by a\nthreshold number of adopting neighbors above which adoption occurs (i.e.,\ncomplex contagions). Recent work has argued that highly clustered, rather than\nrandom, networks facilitate spread of these complex contagions. Here we show\nthat minor modifications to this model, which make it more realistic, reverse\nthis result, thereby harmonizing qualitative facts about how network structure\naffects contagion. To model the trade-off between long and short edges we\nanalyze the rate of spread over networks that are the union of circular\nlattices and random graphs on $n$ nodes. Allowing for noise in adoption\ndecisions (i.e., adoptions below threshold) to occur with order $1/\\sqrt{n}$\nprobability along some \"short\" cycle edges) is enough to ensure that random\nrewiring accelerates spread. This conclusion continues to hold true under\npartial but frequent enough rewiring and when adoption decisions are reversible\nbut infrequently so. Simulations illustrate the robustness of these results to\nseveral variations on this noisy best-response behavior. Hypothetical\ninterventions that randomly rewire existing edges or add random edges (versus\nadding \"short\", triad-closing edges) in hundreds of empirical social networks\nreduce time to spread. This revised conclusion suggests that those wanting to\nincrease spread should induce formation of long ties, rather than triad-closing\nties. More generally, this highlights the importance of noise in game-theoretic\nanalyses of behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 17:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 18:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 00:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 17:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The notion of first-order constrained\nHorn clauses has recently been extended to higher-order logic by Cathcart Burn\net al. To exploit the remarkable efficiency of SMT solving, a natural approach\nto solve systems of higher-order Horn constraints is to reduce them to systems\nof first-order Horn constraints. This paper presents a defunctionalization\nalgorithm to achieve the reduction.\n  Given a well-sorted higher-order constrained Horn clause (HoCHC) problem\ninstance, the defunctionalization algorithm constructs a first-order\nwell-sorted constrained Horn clause problem. In addition to well-sortedness of\nthe algorithm's output, we prove that if an input HoCHC is solvable, then the\nresult of its defunctionalization is solvable. The converse also holds, which\nwe prove using a recent result on the continuous semantics of HoCHC. To our\nknowledge, this defunctionalization algorithm is the first sound and complete\nreduction from systems of higher-order Horn constraints to systems of\nfirst-order Horn constraints.\n  We have constructed DefMono, a prototype implementation of the\ndefunctionalization algorithm. It first defunctionalizes an input HoCHC problem\nand then feeds the result into a backend SMT solver.

This would\nfacilitate combinations and comparisons of it with results from current and\nfuture polarisation surveys such as Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's\nMagnetism (POSSUM), VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), and the eventual Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA). Our on-axis pointed observations, in conjunction with simulations,\nallowed us to estimate the impact of off-axis polarisation leakage on the\nmeasured RM values. This demonstrates the importance to properly calibrate for\nthe off-axis leakage terms in future all-sky polarisation surveys, in order to\nobtain high fidelity polarisation information from sources down to low\nfractional polarisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

These operators naturally arise when computing the\nprobability of measurement sequences, and generalize the \"sum over position\nhistories \" of the Feynman path-integral. As we argue in the present note, this\ndescription has some computational advantages over the usual state vector\ndescription, and may help to clarify some issues regarding nonlocality of\nquantum correlations and collapse. A measurement on a system described by $C$\nmodifies the history operator, $C \\rightarrow PC$, where $P$ is the projector\ncorresponding to the measurement. We refer to this modification as \"history\noperator collapse\". Thus $C$ keeps track of the succession of measurements on a\nsystem, and contains all histories compatible with the results of these\nmeasurements. The collapse modifies the history content of $C$, and therefore\nmodifies also the past (relative to the measurement), but never in a way to\nviolate causality. Probabilities of outcomes are obtained as $Tr(C^\\dagger P\nC)/Tr(C^\\dagger C)$. A similar formula yields probabilities for intermediate\nmeasurements, and reproduces the result of the two-vector formalism in the case\nof given initial and final states.

A quantum analogue of the IBM has recently been defined, and an\nattempt at providing an operational interpretation of the so-called quantum IB\nfunction as an optimal rate of an information-theoretic task, has recently been\nmade by Salek et al. However, the interpretation given in that paper has a\ncouple of drawbacks; firstly its proof is based on a conjecture that the\nquantum IB function is convex, and secondly, the expression for the rate\nfunction involves certain entropic quantities which occur explicitly in the\nvery definition of the underlying information-theoretic task, thus making the\nlatter somewhat contrived. We overcome both of these drawbacks by first proving\nthe convexity of the quantum IB function, and then giving an alternative\noperational interpretation of it as the optimal rate of a bona fide\ninformation-theoretic task, namely that of quantum source coding with quantum\nside information at the decoder, and relate the quantum IB function to the rate\nregion of this task. We similarly show that the related privacy funnel function\nis convex (both in the classical and quantum case). However, we comment that it\nis unlikely that the quantum privacy funnel function can characterize the\noptimal asymptotic rate of an information theoretic task, since even its\nclassical version lacks a certain additivity property which turns out to be\nessential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 18:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 13:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 16:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-09"}

This paper proposes a\nnew signal processing module, called an unmixing transducer, and describes its\nimplementation using a windowed BLSTM. The unmixing transducer has a fixed\nnumber, say J, of output channels, where J may be different from the number of\nmeeting attendees, and transforms an input multi-channel acoustic signal into J\ntime-synchronous audio streams. Each utterance in the meeting is separated and\nemitted from one of the output channels. Then, each output signal can be simply\nfed to a speech recognition back-end for segmentation and transcription. Our\nmeeting transcription system using the unmixing transducer outperforms a system\nbased on a state-of-the-art neural mask-based beamformer by 10.8%.

Both WCP schemes (direct WCP, D-WCP,\nand indirect WCP, I-WCP) have been incorporated into recent 5G networks;\nhowever, a discussion of their design principles and their design limitations\nis missing. This paper introduces an overview of the WCP design (I-WCP and\nD-WCP) and discusses its intricacies by reviewing its deployment in recent 5G\nnetworks. Furthermore, to facilitate synthesizing a robust WCP, this paper\nproposes a generic WCP framework using deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nprinciples and presents a roadmap for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 19:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

While the\nphysics of few-component liquid mixtures (i.e., binary and ternary ones) is\nwell-understood and routinely taught in undergraduate courses, the\nthermodynamic and kinetic properties of $N$-component mixtures with $N>3$ have\nremained relatively unexplored. An example of such a mixture is provided by the\nintracellular fluid, in which protein-rich droplets phase separate into\ndistinct membraneless organelles. In this work, we investigate equilibrium\nphase behavior and morphology of $N$-component liquid mixtures within the\nFlory-Huggins theory of regular solutions. In order to determine the number of\ncoexisting phases and their compositions, we developed a new algorithm for\nconstructing complete phase diagrams, based on numerical convexification of the\ndiscretized free energy landscape. Together with a Cahn-Hilliard approach for\nkinetics, we employ this method to study mixtures with $N=4$ and $5$\ncomponents. We report on both the coarsening behavior of such systems, as well\nas the resulting morphologies in three spatial dimensions. We discuss how the\nnumber of coexisting phases and their compositions can be extracted with\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering algorithms. Finally,\nwe discuss how one can reverse engineer the interaction parameters and volume\nfractions of components in order to achieve a range of desired packing\nstructures, such as nested `Russian dolls' and encapsulated Janus droplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2018 20:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

Adversarial training, which augments the training\ndata with adversarial examples during the training process, is a well known\ndefense to improve the robustness of the model against adversarial attacks.\nHowever, this robustness is only effective to the same attack method used for\nadversarial training. Madry et al.(2017) suggest that effectiveness of\niterative multi-step adversarial attacks and particularly that projected\ngradient descent (PGD) may be considered the universal first order adversary\nand applying the adversarial training with PGD implies resistance against many\nother first order attacks. However, the computational cost of the adversarial\ntraining with PGD and other multi-step adversarial examples is much higher than\nthat of the adversarial training with other simpler attack techniques.

In this work, we explore the possibility of\nlearning a version of the agent's design that is better suited for its task,\njointly with the policy. We propose an alteration to the popular OpenAI Gym\nframework, where we parameterize parts of an environment, and allow an agent to\njointly learn to modify these environment parameters along with its policy. We\ndemonstrate that an agent can learn a better structure of its body that is not\nonly better suited for the task, but also facilitates policy learning. Joint\nlearning of policy and structure may even uncover design principles that are\nuseful for assisted-design applications.

To\nsolve this challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Unsupervised\nOnline Video Object Segmentation (UOVOS) framework by construing the motion\nproperty to mean moving in concurrence with a generic object for segmented\nregions. By incorporating salient motion detection and object proposal, a\npixel-wise fusion strategy is developed to effectively remove detection noise\nsuch as dynamic background and stationary objects. Furthermore, by leveraging\nthe obtained segmentation from immediately preceding frames, a forward\npropagation algorithm is employed to deal with unreliable motion detection and\nobject proposals. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

The application of the sub-sampling PLL is the key to simplify the\narchitecture of the synthesizer in this scheme. A 100 MHz oven controlled\ncrystal oscillator (OCXO) with ultra-low phase noise is used as the initial\nsignal source. Then a dielectric resonant oscillator (DRO) of 6.8 GHz is\ndirectly phase locked to the 100 MHz OCXO utilizing the sub-sampling PLL.\nBenefiting from the sub-sampling PLL, the processes of microwave frequency\nmultiplication and phase lock which are necessary in the development of\nmicrowave synthesizer are greatly simplified. Therefore, the architecture of\nthe synthesizer is very simple. Correspondingly, the power consumption and cost\nof the synthesizer are low. The absolute phase noises of the 6.835 GHz output\nsignal are measured to be -47 dBc/Hz, -77 dBc/Hz, -104 dBc/Hz and -121 dBc/Hz\nat 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 100 Hz and 1 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. he\nsynthesizer can be used as the local oscillator of the Rb atomic clocks.

With this motivation, in order to recover the important\nfeatures of the braneworld model from a more global perspective, here, we\ninvestigate the global cosmological dynamics of the braneworld model using\ndynamical system techniques.

The approximate Bellman operator has a\ncomputational advantage because it involves a convex optimization problem in\nthe case of control-affine systems and convex costs. Using this feature, we\npropose a simple dynamic programming algorithm to evaluate the approximate\nvalue function at pre-specified grid points by solving convex optimization\nproblems in each iteration. We show that the proposed method approximates the\noptimal value function with a uniform convergence property in the case of\nconvex optimal value functions.

When a nonlinear control-affine\nsystem is considered, the convex optimization approach provides an approximate\npolicy with a provable suboptimality bound.

This is the more rapid change in\nthe surface air temperature (SAT) in the Arctic compared to some wider\nreference region, such as the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mean. Many different\nmetrics have been developed to quantify the degree of AA based on SAT\nanomalies, trends and variability. The use of different metrics, as well as the\nchoice of dataset to use can affect conclusions about the magnitude and\ntemporal variability of AA. Here we review the established metrics of AA to see\nhow well they agree upon the temporal signature of AA, such as the\nmulti-decadal variability, and assess the consistency in these metrics across\ndifferent commonly-used datasets which cover both the early and late 20th\ncentury warming in the Arctic.

However, there are large seasonal\ndifferences in the consistency between datasets. Moreover, the largest\ndifferences between the century-long reanalysis products and observations are\nduring the early warming period, likely due to the sparseness of the\nobservations in the Arctic at that time. In the modern warming period, the high\ndensity of observations strongly constrains all the reanalysis products,\nwhether they include satellite observations or only surface observations.

We obtained quasi-simultaneous observations of the AGB star Mira\nusing ALMA and ZIMPOL to probe the distribution of gas and large dust grains,\nrespectively. The polarized light images show dust around Mira~A, the companion\n(Mira~B) and in a trail that connects the two sources. ALMA reveals that dust\naround Mira~A is contained in a high-gas-density region with a significant\nfraction of the polarized light arising from its edge. We constrained the gas\ndensity, temperature, and velocity within a few stellar radii from the star by\nmodelling the CO $v=1, J=3-2$ line.

The deposition of metal electrodes, the\ndesign and specific configuration of contacts can have profound effects on the\nelectronic properties of the devices possibly even affecting the alignment of\ngraphene/hBN superlattices. In this work we probe the strain configuration of\ngraphene on hBN contacted with two types of metal contacts, two-dimensional\n(2D) top-contacts and one-dimensional (1D) edge-contacts. We show that\ntop-contacts induce strain in the graphene layer along two opposing leads,\nleading to a complex strain pattern across the device channel. Edge-contacts,\non the contrary, do not show such strain pattern. A finite-elements modelling\nsimulation is used to confirm that the observed strain pattern is generated by\nthe mechanical action of the metal contacts clamped to the graphene. Thermal\nannealing is shown to reduce the overall doping whilst increasing the overall\nstrain, indicating and increased interaction between graphene and hBN.\nSurprisingly, we find that the two contacts configurations lead to different\ntwist-angles in graphene/hBN superlattices, which converge to the same value\nafter thermal annealing. This observation confirms the self-locking mechanism\nof graphene/hBN superlattices also in the presence of strain gradients. Our\nexperiments may have profound implications in the development of future\nelectronic devices based on heterostructures and provide a new mechanism to\ninduce complex strain patterns in 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 10:52:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 15:34:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 10:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

Such\n`microcombs', provide a broad bandwidth with low power consumption,\nunprecedented form factor, wafer scale fabrication compatibility.

The proposed\nstructural features are extracted from the dependency features of the question\nand supported document. Experimental results show that structural features\nimprove the accuracy of answer extraction when combined with the basic features\nand designed using dependency principles. Proposed structural features use new\ndesign principles which extract the long-distance relations. This addition is a\npossible reason behind the improvement in overall answer extraction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 11:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

The spatial uncertainty of the inferred\npetro-elastic properties is represented with the updated a posteriori variance\nfrom an ensemble of the simulated realizations. Within this setting, the\nlarge-scale geological (metaparameters) used to generate the petro-elastic\nrealizations, such as the spatial correlation model and the global a priori\ndistribution of the properties of interest, are assumed to be known and\nstationary for the entire inversion domain. This assumption leads to\nunderestimation of the uncertainty associated with the inverted models. We\npropose a practical framework to quantify uncertainty of the large-scale\ngeological parameters in seismic inversion. The framework couples\ngeostatistical seismic inversion with a stochastic adaptive sampling and\nBayesian inference of the metaparameters to provide a more accurate and\nrealistic prediction of uncertainty not restricted by heavy assumptions on\nlarge-scale geological parameters. The proposed framework is illustrated with\nboth synthetic and real case studies. The results show the ability retrieve\nmore reliable acoustic impedance models with a more adequate uncertainty spread\nwhen compared with conventional geostatistical seismic inversion techniques.\nThe proposed approach separately account for geological uncertainty at\nlarge-scale (metaparameters) and local scale (trace-by-trace inversion).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 11:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

Stars can maintain their observable magnetic activity from the PMS\nto the tip of the red giant branch. However, the number of known active giants\nis much lower than active stars on the main sequence since on the giant branch\nthe stars spend only about 10% of their main sequence lifetime. Due to their\nrapid evolution it is difficult to estimate the stellar parameters of giant\nstars. A possibility for obtaining more reliable stellar parameters of an\nactive giant arises when it is a member of an eclipsing binary system.\n  Aims. We have discovered EPIC 211759736, an active spotted giant star in an\neclipsing binary system during the Kepler K2 Campaign 5. The eclipsing nature\nallows us to much better constrain the stellar parameters than in most cases of\nactive giant stars. Method. We have combined the K2 data with archival HATNet\nand DASCH photometry, new spectroscopic radial velocity measurements, and a set\nof follow-up ground-based BVRI photometric observations, to find the binary\nsystem parameters as well as robust spot models for the giant at two different\nepochs.\n  Results. We determined the physical parameters of both stellar components and\nprovide a description of the rotational and long-term activity of the primary\ncomponent. The temperatures and luminosities of both components were examined\nin the context of the HR diagram. We find that both the primary and the\nsecondary components deviate from the evolutionary tracks corresponding to\ntheir masses in the sense that the stars appear in the diagram at lower masses\nthan their true masses.\n  Conclusions. We further evaluate the proposition that active giants have\nmasses that are found to be generally higher by traditional methods than are\nindicated by stellar evolution tracks in the HR diagram. A possible reason for\nthis discrepancy could be a strong magnetic field, since we see greater\ndifferences in more active stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 11:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

In this paper, we propose a proximal linearized\naugmented Lagrangian algorithm (PLAM) for solving optimization problems with\northogonality constraints. Unlike the classical augmented Lagrangian methods,\nin our algorithm, the prime variables are updated by minimizing a proximal\nlinearized approximation of the augmented Lagrangian function, meanwhile the\ndual variables are updated by a closed-form expression which holds at any\nfirst-order stationary point. The orthonormalization procedure is only invoked\nonce at the last step of the above mentioned algorithm if high-precision\nfeasibility is needed. Consequently, the main parts of the proposed algorithm\ncan be parallelized naturally. We establish global subsequence convergence,\nworst-case complexity and local convergence rate for PLAM under some mild\nassumptions. To reduce the sensitivity of the penalty parameter, we put forward\na modification of PLAM, which is called parallelizable column-wise block\nminimization of PLAM (PCAL). Numerical experiments in serial illustrate that\nthe novel updating rule for the Lagrangian multipliers significantly\naccelerates the convergence of PLAM and makes it comparable with the existent\nfeasible solvers for optimization problems with orthogonality constraints, and\nthe performance of PCAL does not highly rely on the choice of the penalty\nparameter.

For example, these kernels\nhave been used as a regularizer in various supervised learning tasks for\ndenoising images. Importantly, these heat kernels give rise to operators that\ninclude (but are not restricted to) the generators of the classical Laplacian\nassociated to Brownian processes as well as the fractional Laplacian associated\nwith $\\beta$-stable L\\'evy processes. For local kernels, while the method is a\nversion of the diffusion maps algorithm, we show that the applications with\nnon-Gaussian local heat kernels approximate temporally rescaled\nLaplace-Beltrami operators. For the non-local heat kernels, we modify the\ndiffusion maps algorithm to estimate fractional Laplacian operators. Here, the\ngraph distance is used to approximate the geodesic distance with appropriate\nerror bounds. While this approximation becomes numerically expensive as the\nnumber of data points increases, it produces an accurate operator estimation\nthat is robust to the choice of the kernel bandwidth parameter value.

In the past few years, both knowledge-driven\nmaximum a posterior (MAP) with prior modelings and fully data-dependent\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) techniques have been investigated to address\nspecific enhancement tasks. In this paper, by exploiting the advantages of\nthese two types of mechanisms within a complementary propagation perspective,\nwe propose a unified framework, named deep prior ensemble (DPE), for solving\nvarious image enhancement tasks. Specifically, we first establish the basic\npropagation scheme based on the fundamental image modeling cues and then\nintroduce residual CNNs to help predicting the propagation direction at each\nstage. By designing prior projections to perform feedback control, we\ntheoretically prove that even with experience-inspired CNNs, DPE is definitely\nconverged and the output will always satisfy our fundamental task constraints.\nThe main advantage against conventional optimization-based MAP approaches is\nthat our descent directions are learned from collected training data, thus are\nmuch more robust to unwanted local minimums. While, compared with existing CNN\ntype networks, which are often designed in heuristic manners without\ntheoretical guarantees, DPE is able to gain advantages from rich task cues\ninvestigated on the bases of domain knowledges. Therefore, DPE actually\nprovides a generic ensemble methodology to integrate both knowledge and\ndata-based cues for different image enhancement tasks. More importantly, our\ntheoretical investigations verify that the feedforward propagations of DPE are\nproperly controlled toward our desired solution. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed DPE outperforms state-of-the-arts on a variety of\nimage enhancement tasks in terms of both quantitative measure and visual\nperception quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 14:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Electrons in the focus of next generation multi-PW lasers\nare expected to reach this threshold. We identify three distinct cascading\nregimes in the interaction of counter-propagating, circularly-polarised laser\npulses with a thin foil by performing a comprehensive scan over the laser\nintensity (from $10^{23}$ -- $5\\times10^{24}$\\ Wcm$^{-2}$) and initial foil\ntarget density (from $10^{26}$ -- $10^{31}$\\ m$^{-3}$).

If the intensity and\ntarget density are high enough the number density of created pairs reaches the\nrelativistically-corrected critical density, the pair plasma efficiently\nabsorbs the laser energy (through radiation reaction) and the cascade\nsaturates.

In the development of a deep-learning based system, manual\nlabeling to make ground truth data (GTD) is an important but expensive task.\nFurthermore, the quality of GTD is closely related to the performance of a\nsupervised learning algorithm. To reduce manual work in the labeling process,\nwe generated weakly annotated GTD by marking only character centroids. Whereas\nbounding-boxes for characters require at least a drag-and-drop operation or two\nclicks to annotate a character location, the weakly annotated GTD requires a\nsingle click to record a character location. The main contribution of this\npaper is on selective distillation to improve the quality of the weakly\nannotated GTD. Because manual GTD are usually generated by many people, it may\ncontain personal bias or human error. To address this problem, the information\nin manual GTD is integrated and refined by selective distillation. In the\nprocess of selective distillation, a fully convolutional network is trained\nusing the weakly annotated GTD, and its prediction maps are selectively used to\nrevise locations and boundaries of semantic regions of characters in the\ninitial GTD.

Ecological\nfacilitation, the positive effect of density of individuals on the individual's\nsurvival across a stress gradient, is a complex phenomenon. A large number of\ntree individuals coupled with soil moisture, temperature, and water stress data\nacross a long temporal period were followed. Data driven analysis in the\nabsence of hypothesis was performed. Information theoretic analysis of multiple\nstatistical models was employed in order to quantify the best data-driven index\nof vegetation density and spatial scale of interactions. Sequentially, tree\nsurvival was quantified as a function of the size of the individual, vegetation\ndensity, and time at the optimal spatial interaction scale. Land surface\ntemperature and soil moisture were also statistically explained by tree size,\ndensity, and time. Results indicated that in space both facilitation and\ncompetition coexist in the same ecosystem and the sign and magnitude of this\ndepend on the spatial scale. Overall, within the optimal data driven spatial\nscale, tree survival was best explained by the interaction between density and\nyear, sifting overall from facilitation to competition through time. However,\nsmall sized trees were always facilitated by increased densities, while large\nsized trees had either negative or no density effects. Tree size was more\nimportant predictor than density in survival and this has implications for\nnature based solutions: maintaining large tree individuals or planting species\nthat can become large-sized can safeguard against tree less areas by promoting\nsurvival at long time periods through harsh environmental conditions. Large\ntrees had also a significant effect in moderating land surface temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 14:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

This paper presents the\nmethods developed to calibrate the raw photometry of the MASCARA and bRing\nstations and characterizes the performance of the methods and instruments.\nMethods: For the primary calibration a modified version of the coarse\ndecorrelation algorithm is used, which corrects for the extinction due to the\nearth's atmosphere, the camera transmission, and intrapixel variations.\nResidual trends are removed from the light curves of individual stars using\nempirical secondary calibration methods. In order to optimize these methods, as\nwell as characterize the performance of the instruments, transit signals were\ninjected in the data. Results: After optimal calibration an RMS scatter of 10\nmmag at $m_V \\sim 7.5$ is achieved in the light curves. By injecting transit\nsignals with periods between one and five days in the MASCARA data obtained by\nthe La Palma station over the course of one year, we demonstrate that MASCARA\nLa Palma is able to recover 84.0, 60.5 and 20.7% of signals with depths of 2, 1\nand 0.5% respectively, with a strong dependency on the observed declination,\nrecovering 65.4% of all transit signals at $\\delta > 0^\\circ$ versus 35.8% at\n$\\delta < 0^\\circ$.

By mapping the point cloud of the current object to the\npre-trained point cloud, a transformation function can be constructed. The\nmanipulator's trajectory for pre-trained shapes can be warped with this\ntransformation function, yielding a feasible trajectory for the new shape.\nHowever, usually this transformation function regards objects as discrete\npoints, and dismisses the topological structures. Therefore, it risks\nover-stretching or over-compression during manipulation. To tackle this\nproblem, this paper proposes a tangent space point set registration method. A\ntangent space representation of an object is constructed by defining an angle\nfor each node on the object. Point set registration algorithm runs in this\nnewly-constructed tangent space, yielding a tangent space trajectory. The\ntrajectory is then converted back to Cartesian space and carried out by the\nrobot. Compared to its counterpart in Cartesian space, tangent space point set\nregistration is safer and more robust, succeeding in a series of experiments\nsuch as rope straightening, rope knotting, cloth folding and unfolding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 15:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

For inference, state-of-the-art\nencoder-decoder architectures for monocular depth estimation rely on effective\nfeature representations learned at training time.

Recent works have shed light on the visual features that make\ngeneric images, object images or face photographs memorable. However, these\nmethods are not able to effectively predict the memorability of outdoor natural\nscene images. To overcome this shortcoming of previous works, in this paper, we\nprovide an attempt to answer: \"what exactly makes outdoor natural scenes\nmemorable\". To this end, we first establish a large-scale outdoor natural scene\nimage memorability (LNSIM) database, containing 2,632 outdoor natural scene\nimages with their ground truth memorability scores and the multi-label scene\ncategory annotations. Then, similar to previous works, we mine our database to\ninvestigate how low-, middle- and high-level handcrafted features affect the\nmemorability of outdoor natural scenes. In particular, we find that the\nhigh-level feature of scene category is rather correlated with outdoor natural\nscene memorability, and the deep features learnt by deep neural network (DNN)\nare also effective in predicting the memorability scores. Moreover, combining\nthe deep features with the category feature can further boost the performance\nof memorability prediction. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end DNN based\noutdoor natural scene memorability (DeepNSM) predictor, which takes advantage\nof the learned category-related features. Then, the experimental results\nvalidate the effectiveness of our DeepNSM model, exceeding the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Finally, we try to understand the reason of the good performance for\nour DeepNSM model, and also study the cases that our DeepNSM model succeeds or\nfails to accurately predict the memorability of outdoor natural scenes.

(Previous version had a typo in one of the\n  Laplace functional expressions.) All code available online:\n  https://github.com/hpaulkeeler/DetPoisson_MATLAB","journal-ref":"Proc. of IEEE WCNC 2019","doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.LG math.PR","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  A new type of dependent thinning for point processes in continuous space is\nproposed, which leverages the advantages of determinantal point processes\ndefined on finite spaces and, as such, is particularly amenable to statistical,\nnumerical, and simulation techniques. It gives a new point process that can\nserve as a network model exhibiting repulsion. The properties and functions of\nthe new point process, such as moment measures, the Laplace functional, the\nvoid probabilities, as well as conditional (Palm) characteristics can be\nestimated accurately by simulating the underlying (non-thinned) point process,\nwhich can be taken, for example, to be Poisson. This is in contrast (and\npreference to) finite Gibbs point processes, which, instead of thinning,\nrequire weighting the Poisson realizations, involving usually intractable\nnormalizing constants. Models based on determinantal point processes are also\nwell suited for statistical (supervised) learning techniques, allowing the\nmodels to be fitted to observed network patterns with some particular geometric\nproperties. We illustrate this approach by imitating with determinantal\nthinning the well-known Mat{\\'e}rn~II hard-core thinning, as well as a\nsoft-core thinning depending on nearest-neighbour triangles. These two examples\ndemonstrate how the proposed approach can lead to new, statistically optimized,\nprobabilistic transmission scheduling schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 10:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 19:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

We calculate the most probable trajectory by spatially maximizing the\nprobability density of the system path, i.e., the solution of the associated\nnonlocal Fokker-Planck equation. We especially examine those most probable\ntrajectories from low concentration state to high concentration state (i.e.,\nthe likely transcription regime) for certain parameters, in order to gain\ninsights into the transcription processes and the tipping time for the\ntranscription likely to occur. This enables us: (i) to visualize the progress\nof concentration evolution (i.e., observe whether the system enters the\ntranscription regime within a given time period); (ii) to predict or avoid\ncertain transcriptions via selecting specific noise parameters in particular\nregions in the parameter space. Moreover, we have found some peculiar or\ncounter-intuitive phenomena in this gene model system, including (a) a smaller\nnoise intensity may trigger the transcription process, while a larger noise\nintensity can not, under the same asymmetric L\\'evy noise. This phenomenon does\nnot occur in the case of symmetric L\\'evy noise; (b) the symmetric L\\'evy\nmotion always induces transition to high concentration, but certain asymmetric\nL\\'evy motions do not trigger the switch to transcription. These findings\nprovide insights for further experimental research, in order to achieve or to\navoid specific gene transcriptions, with possible relevance for medical\nadvances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 07:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 12:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}
