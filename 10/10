In recent years, Deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) has gained great success in several application\ndomains. It is an applicable method for IoT and smart city scenarios where\nauto-generated data can be partially labeled by users' feedback for training\npurposes. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement\nlearning model that fits smart city applications as it consumes both labeled\nand unlabeled data to improve the performance and accuracy of the learning\nagent. The model utilizes Variational Autoencoders (VAE) as the inference\nengine for generalizing optimal policies.

As a case study of smart city\napplications, we focus on smart buildings and apply the proposed model to the\nproblem of indoor localization based on BLE signal strength. Indoor\nlocalization is the main component of smart city services since people spend\nsignificant time in indoor environments.

However, recent works have suggested the existence of an intermediate\npopulation in the bursts observed by the Swift satellite. Moreover, some\nresearchers have questioned the universality of the 2.0-second dividing line\nbetween short and long bursts: some bursts may be short but actually result\nfrom collapsars, the physical mechanism behind normally long bursts, and some\nlong ones may originate from mergers, the usual progenitors of short GRBs. In\nthis work, we focus on GRBs detected by the Fermi satellite and study the\ndistribution of their durations measured in the observer's reference frame and,\nfor those with known redshifts, in the bursts' reference frames. However, there\nare relatively few bursts with measured redshifts, and this makes an accurate\nstudy difficult. To overcome this problem, we follow [Zhang:2018] and determine\na \"pseudo-redshift\" from the correlation relation between the luminosity $L_p$\nand the energy $E_p$, both of which are calculated at the peak of the flux.\nInterestingly, we find that the uncertainties in the quantities observed and\nused in the determination of pseudo-redshifts, do affect the precision of the\nindividual results significantly, but they keep the distribution of\npseudo-redshifts very similar to that of the actual ones and thus allow us to\nuse pseudo-redshifts for our statistical study.

These high-energy flares are often\ndifficult to explain with shock acceleration models due to the small size of\nthe inferred emitting region, with recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations\nshowing that magnetic reconnection is a promising alternative mechanism. Here,\nwe present a macroscopic emission model physically motivated by PIC\nsimulations, where the energy for particle acceleration originates from the\nreconnecting magnetic field. We track the radial growth and relative velocity\nof a reconnecting plasmoid, modelling particle acceleration and radiative\nlosses from synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. To test\nthe viability of magnetic reconnection as the mechanism behind rapid blazar\nflares we simultaneously fit our model to the observed light-curve and SED from\nthe 2016 TeV flare of BL Lacertae. We find generally that, without considering\nexternal photons, reconnecting plasmoids are unable to produce Compton-dominant\nTeV flares and so cannot reproduce the observations due to overproduction of\nsynchrotron emission. Additionally, problematically large plasmoids, comparable\nin size to the entire jet radius, are required to emit sufficient SSC\ngamma-rays to be observable. However, our plasmoid model can reproduce the\nrapid TeV lightcurve of the flare, demonstrating that reconnection is able to\nproduce rapid, powerful TeV flares on observed timescales. We conclude that\nwhile reconnection can produce SSC flares on the correct timescales, the\nprimary source of TeV emission cannot be SSC and the size of plasmoids required\nmay be implausibly large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 17:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 09:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

A naturally\narising question is how to describe time evolution relative to quantum clocks\nand, specifically, how the dynamics relative to different quantum clocks are\nrelated. This is a pressing issue in view of the multiple choice problem of\ntime in quantum gravity, which posits that there is no distinguished choice of\ninternal clock in generic general relativistic systems and that different\nchoices lead to inequivalent quantum theories. Exploiting a recent approach to\nswitching quantum reference systems (arXiv:1809.00556, arXiv:1809:05093), we\nexhibit a systematic method for switching between different clock choices in\nthe quantum theory. We illustrate it by means of the parametrized particle,\nwhich, like gravity, features a Hamiltonian constraint. We explicitly switch\nbetween the quantum evolution relative to the non-relativistic time variable\nand that relative to the particle's position, which requires carefully\nregularizing the zero-modes in the so-called time-of-arrival observable. While\nthis toy model is simple, our approach is general and directly amenable to\nquantum cosmology. It proceeds by systematically linking the reduced quantum\ntheories relative to different clock choices via the clock-choice-neutral Dirac\nquantized theory, in analogy to coordinate changes on a manifold. This method\nsuggests a new perspective on the multiple choice problem, indicating that it\nis rather a multiple choice feature of a complete relational quantum theory,\ntaken as the conjunction of Dirac quantized and quantum deparametrized\ntheories. Precisely this conjunction permits one to consistently switch between\ndifferent temporal reference systems which is a prerequisite for a quantum\nnotion of general covariance. Finally, we show that quantum uncertainties lead\nto discontinuity in the relational dynamics when switching clocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 17:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 16:23:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 15:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Our work provides\na useful approach for studying the dynamics and physical parameters of galaxy\nmergers, which can play an important part in future multi-messenger studies of\nsimilar and related extragalactic sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 17:57:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 18:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 23:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 16:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

It has been reported that the pre-transitional T Tauri star\nLkCa 15 could host three planets; candidate planet b is in the process of\nformation, as inferred from its H$\\alpha$ emission. However, a more recent work\ncasts doubts on the planetary nature of the previous detections. We have\nobserved LkCa 15 with ISIS/WHT. The spectrograph's slit was oriented towards\nthe last reported position of LkCa 15 b (parallel direction) and 90degr from\nthat (perpendicular). The photocenter and full width half maximum (FWHM) of the\nGaussians fitting the spatial distribution at H$\\alpha$ and the adjacent\ncontinuum were measured. A well-known binary (GU CMa) was used as a calibrator\nto test the spectro-astrometric performance of ISIS/WHT, recovering consistent\nphotocenter and FWHM signals. However, the photocenter shift predicted for LkCa\n15 b is not detected, but the FWHM in H$\\alpha$ is broader than in the\ncontinuum for both slit positions. Our simulations show that the photocenter\nand FWHM observations cannot be explained simultaneously by an accreting\nplanet. In turn, both spectro-astrometric observations are naturally reproduced\nfrom a roughly symmetric Halpha emitting region centered on the star and extent\ncomparable to the orbit originally attributed to the planet at several au. The\nextended H$\\alpha$ emission around LkCa 15 could be related to a variable disk\nwind, but additional multi-epoch data and detailed modeling are necessary to\nunderstand its physical nature. Spectro-astrometry in H$\\alpha$ is able to test\nthe presence of accreting planets and can be used as a complementary technique\nto survey planet formation in circumstellar disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

At low thresholds (LT), gas is unable to reach densities high\nenough to dominate the gravitational potential before being dispersed by\nfeedback from supernovae. LT runs show little effect on the inner DM profile,\neven in systems with extended and bursty SF, two ingredients often cited as\ncritical for core formation. For higher thresholds, gas is able to dominate the\ngravitational potential before being ejected by feedback. This can lead to a\nsubstantial reduction in the inner DM content, but only if the gas is\ngravitationally important over an extended period of time, allowing the halo to\ncontract before gas removal. Rapid assembly and removal of gas in short SF\nbursts is less effective at altering the inner DM content.

Most existing wall models rely on assumptions about the state of the\nboundary layer and require a priori prescription of tunable coefficients. They\nalso impose the predicted wall stress by replacing the no-slip boundary\ncondition at the wall with a Neumann boundary condition in the wall-parallel\ndirections while maintaining the no-transpiration condition in the wall-normal\ndirection. In the present study, we first motivate and analyse the Robin (slip)\nboundary condition with transpiration (nonzero wall-normal velocity) in the\ncontext of wall-modelled LES. The effect of the slip boundary condition on the\none-point statistics of the flow is investigated in LES of turbulent channel\nflow and flat-plate turbulent boundary layer. It is shown that the slip\ncondition provides a framework to compensate for the deficit or excess of mean\nmomentum at the wall. Moreover, the resulting nonzero stress at the wall\nalleviates the well-known problem of the wall-stress under-estimation by\ncurrent subgrid-scale (SGS) models. Secondly, we discuss the requirements for\nthe slip condition to be used in conjunction with wall models and derive the\nequation that connects the slip boundary condition with the stress at the wall.\nFinally, a dynamic procedure for the slip coefficients is formulated, providing\na dynamic slip wall model free of a priori specified coefficients. The\nperformance of the proposed dynamic wall model is tested in a series of LES of\nturbulent channel flow, non-equilibrium three-dimensional channel flow, and\nflat-plate turbulent boundary layer. The results show that the dynamic wall\nmodel is able to accurately predict one-point turbulence statistics for various\nflow configurations, Reynolds numbers, and grid resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 18:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

For the\ncase of more than two polynomials we provide an example of an irreducible\npolynomial that is the sum of three squares with coefficients in ${\\mathbb\nQ}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$ that cannot be decomposed as a rational SOS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 19:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

The output of the circuit can be verified classically in linear\ntime, and is guaranteed to contain a polynomial number of certified random bits\nassuming that the device used to generate the output operated using a\n(classical or quantum) circuit of sub-logarithmic depth. This assumption\ncontrasts with the locality assumption used for randomness certification based\non Bell inequality violation or computational assumptions. To demonstrate\nrandomness generation it is sufficient for a device to sample from the ideal\noutput distribution within constant statistical distance.\n  Our procedure is inspired by recent work of Bravyi et al.

Here, we run a full-blown\nsimulation study to accurately characterize the deflections of UHECR nuclei in\nthe GMF. We show that while the cepa stratis structure provides a global\ndescription of anisotropy patterns produced by UHECR nuclei en route to Earth,\nthe hot spots are elongated depending on their location in the sky due to the\nregular structure of the GMF. We demonstrate that with a high-statistics sample\nat the high-energy-end of the spectrum, like the one to be collected by NASA's\nPOEMMA mission, the energy dependence of the hot-spot contours could become a\nuseful observable to identify the nuclear composition of UHECRs. This new\nmethod to determine the nature of the particle species is complementary to\nthose using observables of extensive air showers, and therefore is unaffected\nby the large systematic uncertainties of hadronic interaction models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 21:35:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 19:57:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 13:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-02"}

Here, we report the spatial mapping of photoconductivity in a\nmonolayer-bilayer WSe2 lateral heterostructure under multiple excitation\nlasers. As the photon energy increases, the light-induced conductivity detected\nby microwave impedance microscopy first appears along the hetero-interface and\nbilayer edge, then along the monolayer edge, inside the bilayer area, and\nfinally in the interior of the monolayer region. The sequential emergence of\nmobile carriers in different sections of the sample is consistent with the\ntheoretical calculation of local energy gaps. Quantitative analysis of the\nmicroscopy and transport data also reveals the linear dependence of\nphotoconductivity on the laser intensity and the influence of interlayer\ncoupling on carrier recombination.

Multiple classical approaches have been proposed to detect\nboth single (e.g., tensors) and multiple (e.g., constrained spherical\ndeconvolution, CSD) fiber population orientations per voxel.

Second,\nrepeated scans of human subjects were acquired on two different scanners to\naugment the learning of the network pro-posed. To use these data, we propose a\nnew network architecture, the null space deep network (NSDN), to simultaneously\nlearn on traditional observed/truth pairs (e.g., MRI-histology voxels) along\nwith repeated observations without a known truth (e.g., scan-rescan MRI).

NSDN significantly improved absolute\nperformance relative to histology by 3.87% over CSD and 1.42% over a recently\nproposed deep neural network approach.

Whereas traditional\nfuzzing frameworks generate tests randomly, a model-based framework can deduce\ntests from a behavioral model using a constraint solver. Because the state\nspace being explored by the fuzzer is often large, the rapid generation of test\nvectors is crucial. The need to generate tests quickly, however, is\nantithetical to the use of a constraint solver. Our solution to this problem is\nto use the constraint solver to generate an initial solution, to generalize\nthat solution relative to the system model, and then to perform rapid,\nrepeated, randomized sampling of the generalized solution space to generate\nfuzzing tests. Crucial to the success of this endeavor is a generalization\nprocedure with reasonable size and performance costs that produces generalized\nsolution spaces that can be sampled efficiently. This paper describes a\ngeneralization technique for logical formulae expressed in terms of Boolean\ncombinations of linear constraints that meets the unique performance\nrequirements of model-based fuzzing.

Supporting materials contain an ACL2 proof that verifies the\ncorrectness of a low-level implementation of the generalization algorithm\nagainst a specification of generalization correctness. Finally a\npost-processing procedure is described that results in a restricted trapezoidal\nsolution that can be sampled (solved) rapidly and efficiently without\nbacktracking, even for integer domains. While informal correctness arguments\nare provided, a formal proof of the correctness of the restriction algorithm\nremains as future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 00:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

Proof techniques for these data structures\nexist, but are oriented to unbounded, functional realizations, which are not\ntypically efficient in either space or time. Autonomous systems designers, on\nthe other hand, generally limit the space and time allocations for any given\nfunction, and require that algorithms deliver results within a finite time, or\nsuffer a watchdog timeout.

First, continuity for both complex-valued and\nreal-valued functions of complex numbers is defined, and it is shown that\ncontinuous functions from the complex to the real numbers achieve a minimum\nvalue over a closed square region. An important case of continuous real-valued,\ncomplex functions results from taking the traditional complex norm of a\ncontinuous complex function. We think of these continuous functions as having\nonly one (complex) argument, but in ACL2(r) they appear as functions of two\narguments. The extra argument is a \"context\", which is uninterpreted. For\nexample, it could be other arguments that are held fixed, as in an exponential\nfunction which has a base and an exponent, either of which could be held fixed.\nSecond, it is shown that complex polynomials are continuous, so the norm of a\ncomplex polynomial is a continuous real-valued function and it achieves its\nminimum over an arbitrary square region centered at the origin. This part of\nthe proof benefits from the introduction of the \"context\" argument, and it\nillustrates an innovation that simplifies the proofs of classical properties\nwith unbound parameters. Third, we derive lower and upper bounds on the norm of\nnon-constant polynomials for inputs that are sufficiently far away from the\norigin. This means that a sufficiently large square can be found to guarantee\nthat it contains the global minimum of the norm of the polynomial. Fourth, it\nis shown that if a given number is not a root of a non-constant polynomial,\nthen it cannot be the global minimum. Finally, these results are combined to\nshow that the global minimum must be a root of the polynomial. This result is\npart of a larger effort in the formalization of complex polynomials in ACL2(r).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 00:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

Contrary to its deterministic counterpart, the goal of\nthe robust HVRP is to determine a minimum-cost set of routes and fleet\ncomposition that remains feasible for all demand realizations from a\npre-specified uncertainty set. To solve this problem, we develop robust\nversions of classical node- and edge-exchange neighborhoods that are commonly\nused in local search and establish that efficient evaluation of the local moves\ncan be achieved for five popular classes of uncertainty sets. The proposed\nlocal search is then incorporated in a modular fashion within two metaheuristic\nalgorithms to determine robust HVRP solutions. The quality of the metaheuristic\nsolutions is quantified using an integer programming model that provides lower\nbounds on the optimal solution. An extensive computational study on literature\nbenchmarks shows that the proposed methods allow us to obtain high quality\nrobust solutions for different uncertainty sets and with minor additional\neffort compared to deterministic solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 23:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

To do this, we first show how to pose\nboth the inverse and prediction problems in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.\nWe then show how to incorporate so-called posterior-informed model\napproximation error into this hierarchical framework, using a modified form of\nthe Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach. This enables the use of a\n`coarse', approximate model in place of a finer, more expensive model, while\naccounting for the additional uncertainty and potential bias that this can\nintroduce. Our method requires only simple probability modelling, a relatively\nsmall number of fine model simulations, and only modifies the target posterior\n-- any standard MCMC sampling algorithm can be used to sample the new\nposterior. These corrections can also be used in methods that are not based on\nMCMC sampling. We show that our approach can achieve significant computational\nspeed-ups on two geothermal test problems.

The freedom in the\nevolution on $B$ is used to define an \\emph{extended control landscape} on\nwhich the critical points are investigated in terms of kinematic and dynamic\ngradients. A spectral decomposition of the corresponding extended unitary\nsystem simplifies the landscape analysis which provides: (i) a sufficient\ncondition on the rank of the dynamic gradient of the extended landscape that\nguarantees a trap free search for the final time unitary matrix of system $A$,\nand (ii) a detailed decomposition of the components of the overall dynamic\ngradient matrix. Consequently, if the rank condition is satisfied, a gradient\nalgorithm will find the controls that implements the target unitary on system\n$A$. It is shown that even if the dynamic gradient with respect to the controls\nalone is not full rank, the additional flexibility due to the parameters that\ndefine the extended landscape still can allow for the rank condition of the\nextended landscape to hold. Moreover, satisfaction of the latter rank condition\nsubsumes any assumptions about controllability, reachability and control\nresources. Here satisfaction of the rank condition is taken as an assumption.\nThe conditions which ensure that it holds remain an open research question. We\nlend some numerical support with two common examples for which the rank\ncondition holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 04:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The orientations of deformed nuclei are\nimportant, as it affects the touching distance and also influence the nuclear\nand Coulomb potential, and thus can alter the values of penetration integral\nand half-life. The results obtained by our calculations are in agreement with\nthe values obtained from various phenomenological models. This study brings out\nthe unique characteristics of alpha chains associated with each isotope, which\nwill be helpful for the experimentalist to decide the isotope they would like\nto synthesize and also for their post-synthesis study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 09:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

The notions of a sentence and a word as a meaningful\nlinguistic unit in the language have been a subject matter for the discussion\nin many works that followed later on.

This is mainly due to\nthe frequent settings where the number of variables is large and allowed to\nincrease with the sample size bringing standard inferential procedures to incur\nsignificant loss in terms of performance. Moreover, the complexity of\nstatistical models is also increasing thereby entailing important computational\nchallenges in constructing new estimators or in implementing classical ones. A\ntrade-off between numerical complexity and statistical properties is often\naccepted. However, numerically efficient estimators that are altogether\nunbiased, consistent and asymptotically normal in high dimensional problems\nwould generally be ideal. In this paper, we set a general framework from which\nsuch estimators can easily be derived for wide classes of models. This\nframework is based on the concepts that underlie simulation-based estimation\nmethods such as indirect inference. The approach allows various extensions\ncompared to previous results as it is adapted to possibly inconsistent\nestimators and is applicable to discrete models and/or models with a large\nnumber of parameters. We consider an algorithm, namely the Iterative Bootstrap\n(IB), to efficiently compute simulation-based estimators by showing its\nconvergence properties. Within this framework we also prove the properties of\nsimulation-based estimators, more specifically the unbiasedness, consistency\nand asymptotic normality when the number of parameters is allowed to increase\nwith the sample size. Therefore, an important implication of the proposed\napproach is that it allows to obtain unbiased estimators in finite samples.\nFinally, we study this approach when applied to three common models, namely\nlogistic regression, negative binomial regression and lasso regression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 10:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

To mimic both components mentioned above,\nthereby completing the learning process, we introduce a novel algorithm: Policy\nBelief Learning (PBL). PBL uses a belief module to model the other agent's\nprivate information and a policy module to form a distribution over actions\ninformed by the belief module. Furthermore, to encourage communication by\nactions, we propose a novel auxiliary reward which incentivizes one agent to\nhelp its partner to make correct inferences about its private information. The\nauxiliary reward for communication is integrated into the learning of the\npolicy module.

A significant result is that the load-displacement relation exhibits\ninstabilities in which approaching bodies `jump in' to contact, whereas\nseparated bodies `jump out' at a tensile `pull-off force'. The JKR approach has\nsince been widely used in other geometries, but at small length scales or for\nstiffer materials it is found to be less accurate.

Second, by\nanalyzing eye movements and saliency models, we find that: a) observers look at\ndifferent locations over distorted versus original images, and b) performances\nof saliency models are drastically hindered over distorted images, with the\nmaximum performance drop belonging to Rotation and Shearing distortions.\nFinally, we investigate the effectiveness of different distortions when serving\nas data augmentation transformations.

In particular the detection of a DLO is a\nnon-trivial problem especially under clutter and occlusions (as well as\nself-occlusions). The pose estimation of a DLO results into the identification\nof its parameters related to a designed model, e.g. a basis spline.

This is why we propose a novel framework able to\nperform both a semantic segmentation and b-spline modeling of multiple\ndeformable linear objects simultaneously without strict requirements about\nenvironment (i.e. the background). The core algorithm is based on biased random\nwalks over the Region Adiacency Graph built on a superpixel oversegmentation of\nthe source image.

We find that\nlow ionization parameter, a relatively soft or filtered ionizing spectrum, low\ngas metallicity, kappa-distributed electron energies, or reflection of Ly-alpha\nphotons by HI can all result in significantly enhanced Ly-alpha relative to\nother lines (>10%), with log Ly-alpha/HeII reaching values up to 4.6.

Then, inspired by domain\nconfusion and self-ensembling methods, we propose a combined model to learn\nfeature and class jointly invariant representation, namely Domain Confusion\nwith Self Ensembling (DCSE). The experiments verified that our proposed\napproach can offer better performance than empirical art in a variety of\nunsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 12:09:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 11:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 08:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Nested sampling was\nmainly developed to calculate the marginal likelihood of a model but can\nproduce posterior samples as a by-product.

Moreover, in order to circumvent the potential\nquality-of-service degradation at the users due to the hardware impairments in\nthe transmitters, we judiciously incorporate robustness against such\nvulnerabilities in the precoder design.

Despite its popularity, it is very challenging to guarantee\nthe feature selection consistency of Lasso especially when the dimension of the\ndata is huge. One way to improve the feature selection consistency is to select\nan ideal tuning parameter. Traditional tuning criteria mainly focus on\nminimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model\nprobability, such as cross-validation and BIC, which may either be\ntime-consuming or fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR) when the\nnumber of features is extremely large. The other way is to introduce\npseudo-features to learn the importance of the original ones. Recently, the\nKnockoff filter is proposed to control the FDR when performing feature\nselection. However, its performance is sensitive to the choice of the expected\nFDR threshold. Motivated by these ideas, we propose a new method using\npseudo-features to obtain an ideal tuning parameter. In particular, we present\nthe Efficient Tuning of Lasso (ET-Lasso) to separate active and inactive\nfeatures by adding permuted features as pseudo-features in linear models. The\npseudo-features are constructed to be inactive by nature, which can be used to\nobtain a cutoff to select the tuning parameter that separates active and\ninactive features. Experimental studies on both simulations and real-world data\napplications are provided to show that ET-Lasso can effectively and efficiently\nselect active features under a wide range of scenarios\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 13:25:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 May 2019 04:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

Spectrally resolving non-axisymmetric structure takes only a\ntenth as long for a reasonable noise level, but attributing this structure to\nGI-induced activity would be tentative. Finally, we find that identifying\nfinger-like features in PV diagrams of nearly edge-on discs, which are a direct\nindicator of spirals, is feasible with an on-source time of 19 hr, and hence\nlikely offers the most promising means of confirming GI-driven spiral structure\nin young, embedded protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 14:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

However, in real-life spreading processes, pathogens\noften evolve in response to changing environments and medical interventions and\ninformation is often modified by individuals before being forwarded. In this\npaper, we investigate the evolution of spreading processes on complex networks\nwith the aim of i) revealing the role of evolution on the threshold,\nprobability, and final size of epidemics; and ii) exploring the interplay\nbetween the structural properties of the network and the dynamics of evolution.\nIn particular, we develop a mathematical theory that accurately predicts the\nepidemic threshold and the expected epidemic size as functions of the\ncharacteristics of the spreading process, the evolutionary dynamics of the\npathogen, and the structure of the underlying contact network. In addition to\nthe mathematical theory, we perform extensive simulations on random and\nreal-world contact networks to verify our theory and reveal the significant\nshortcomings of the classical mathematical models that do not capture\nevolution. Our results reveal that the classical, single-type bond-percolation\nmodels may accurately predict the threshold and final size of epidemics, but\ntheir predictions on the probability of emergence are inaccurate on both random\nand real-world networks. This inaccuracy sheds the light on a fundamental\ndisconnect between the classical bond-percolation models and real-life\nspreading processes that entail evolution.

We classified 58 disks with available\npolarimetric observations into six major categories (Ring, Spiral, Giant, Rim,\nFaint, and Small disks) based on their appearance in scattered light. We\nre-calculated the stellar and disk properties from the newly available GAIA DR2\nand related these properties with the disk categories. More than a half of our\nsample shows disk sub-structures. For the remaining sources, the absence of\ndetected features is due to their faintness, to their small size, or to the\ndisk geometry. Faint disks are typically found around young stars and typically\nhost no cavity. There is a possible dichotomy in the near-IR excess of sources\nwith spiral-disks (high) and ring-disks (low). Like spirals, shadows are\nassociated with a high near-IR excess. If we account for the pre-main sequence\nevolutionary timescale of stars with different mass, spiral arms are likely\nassociated to old disks. We also found a loose, shallow declining trend for the\ndisk dust mass with time. Protoplanetary disks may form sub-structures like\nrings very early in their evolution but their detectability in scattered light\nis limited to relatively old sources (more than 5 Myr) where the recurrently\ndetected disk cavities allow to illuminate the outer disk. The shallow decrease\nof disk mass with time might be due to a selection effect, where disks observed\nthus far in scattered light are typically massive, bright transition disks with\nlonger lifetime than most disks. Our study points toward spirals and shadows\nbeing generated by planets of fraction-to-few Jupiter masses that leave their\n(observed) imprint on both the inner disk near the star and the outer disk\ncavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 14:57:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 09:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

However, existing methods for performing this\napproximation are ill-suited in general RL settings for two main reasons:\nFirst, they are computationally expensive, often requiring operations on large\nmatrices. Second, these methods lack adequate justification beyond simple,\ntabular, finite-state settings. In this paper, we present a fully general and\nscalable method for approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian in a\nmodel-free RL context. We systematically evaluate our approach and empirically\nshow that it generalizes beyond the tabular, finite-state setting. Even in\ntabular, finite-state settings, its ability to approximate the eigenvectors\noutperforms previous proposals. Finally, we show the potential benefits of\nusing a Laplacian representation learned using our method in goal-achieving RL\ntasks, providing evidence that our technique can be used to significantly\nimprove the performance of an RL agent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 15:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-11"}

Nevertheless, astronomical observations have detected over 150\ndifferent species in the gas phase in these clouds. The mechanism by which\nmolecules are released from the dust surface below thermal desorption\ntemperatures to be detectable in the gas phase is crucial for understanding the\nchemical evolution in such cold clouds. Chemical desorption, caused by the\nexcess energy of an exothermic reaction, was first proposed as a key molecular\nrelease mechanism almost 50 years ago. Chemical desorption can, in principle,\ntake place at any temperature, even below the thermal desorption temperature.\nTherefore, astrochemical net- work models commonly include this process.\nAlthough there have been a few previous experimental efforts, no infrared\nmeasurement of the surface (which has a strong advantage to quantify chemical\ndesorption) has been performed. Here, we report the first infrared in situ\nmeasurement of chemical desorption during the reactions H + H2S -> HS + H2\n(reaction 1) and HS + H -> H2S (reaction 2), which are key to interstellar\nsulphur chemistry. The present study clearly demonstrates that chemical\ndesorption is a more efficient process for releasing H2S into the gas phase\nthan was previously believed. The obtained effective cross-section for chemical\ndesorption indicates that the chemical desorption rate exceeds the\nphotodesorption rate in typical interstellar environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 05:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

In addition, a very small training budget (200\nevaluations and 10 epochs in training) is spent on each optimized architectures\nin contrast to the usual long training time of hand-crafted networks. Moreover,\ninstead of the standard sequential evaluation in EGO, several candidate\narchitectures are proposed and evaluated in parallel, which saves the execution\noverheads significantly and leads to an efficient automation for deep neural\nnetwork design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 09:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

In addition, recent work also has suggested a simple\n\"close-form\" solution to a robust model on MNIST. Therefore, a natural question\nraised is that is PGD adversarial training really necessary for robust defense?\nIn this paper, we give a negative answer by proposing a training paradigm that\nis comparable to PGD adversarial training on several standard datasets, while\nonly using noisy-natural samples. Specifically, we reformulate the min-max\nobjective in PGD adversarial training by a problem to minimize the original\nnetwork loss plus $l_1$ norms of its gradients w.r.t. the inputs. For the\n$l_1$-norm loss, we propose a computationally-feasible solution by embedding a\ndifferentiable soft-quantization layer after the network input layer.

Extensive empirical evaluations on standard datasets show\nthat our proposed models are comparable to PGD-adversarially-trained models\nunder PGD and BPDA attacks.

Harnessing UAVs as flying base stations (BSs) has\nhelped to achieve a cost-effective and on-the-go wireless network that may be\nused in several scenarios such as to support disaster response and in temporary\nhotspots. Despite the extensive research on the application side of UAVs, the\nintegration of UAVs as BSs into existing wireless networks remains an open\nchallenge. While UAV BSs can help to increase the area spectral efficiency, the\nadded network heterogeneity and BS densification may diminish the capacity\ngains due to increased handover rates. In this work, we shed some light on this\ntradeoff by studying a three tier network architecture consisting of macro,\nsmall, and UAV BSs and analyze its coverage and rate performance. In\nparticular, we consider joint control/data and split architectures and express\nthe rate performance for stationary and mobile users, using an analytical\napproach based on stochastic geometry. While both joint and split architectures\noffer similar performance for stationary users, the numerical results suggest\nthe splitting of control and data plane for mobile users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 23:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

How to make such a topological circuit? This paper illustrates a\nparticular design idea by analyzing a series of topological circuits consisting\npurely of inductors (L) and capacitors (C) connected to each other by wires to\nform periodic lattices. All the examples are treated using a unifying approach\nbased on Lagrangians and the dynamical $H$-matrix. First, the building blocks\nand permutation wiring are introduced using simple circuits in one dimension,\nthe SSH transmission line and a braided ladder analogous to the ice-tray model\nalso known as the $\\pi$-flux ladder. Then, more general building blocks (loops\nand stars) and wiring schemes ($m$-shifts) are introduced. The key concepts of\nemergent pseudo-spin degrees of freedom and synthetic gauge fields are\ndiscussed, and the connection to quantum lattice Hamiltonians is clarified. A\ndiagrammatic notation is introduced to simplify the design and presentation of\nmore complicated circuits. These building blocks are then used to construct\ntopological circuits in higher dimensions. The examples include the circuit\nanalog of Haldane's Chern insulator in two dimensions and quantum Hall\ninsulator in four dimensions featuring finite second Chern numbers. The\ntopological invariants and symmetry protection of the edge modes are discussed\nbased on the $H$-matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 20:25:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}
