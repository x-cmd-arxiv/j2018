Host stellar\nabundances are good proxies of planetary abundances, but only for refractory\nelements. This is particularly true for terrestrial planets, as evidenced by\nthe relative differences in bulk chemical composition between the Sun and the\nEarth and other inner solar system bodies. The elemental abundances of a planet\nhost star must therefore be devolatilised in order to correctly represent the\nbulk chemical composition of its terrestrial planets. Furthermore, nickel and\nlight elements make an important contribution alongside iron to the core of\nterrestrial planets. We therefore adopt an extended chemical network of the\ncore, constrained by an Fe/Ni ratio of 18 $\\pm$ 4 (by number). By applying\nthese constraints to the Sun, our modelling reproduces the composition of the\nmantle and core, as well as the core mass fraction of the Earth.

Our contributions are summarized as follows. For uniform\nhypergraphs, we show that successful testing is always impossible when average\ndegree tends to zero, might be possible when average degree is bounded, and is\npossible when average degree is growing.

A common\ncompromise is to optimize a proxy objective that minimizes a weighted linear\ncombination of per-task losses. However, this workaround is only valid when the\ntasks do not compete, which is rarely the case. In this paper, we explicitly\ncast multi-task learning as multi-objective optimization, with the overall\nobjective of finding a Pareto optimal solution. To this end, we use algorithms\ndeveloped in the gradient-based multi-objective optimization literature. These\nalgorithms are not directly applicable to large-scale learning problems since\nthey scale poorly with the dimensionality of the gradients and the number of\ntasks.

Using the lexicographic discrete\nMorse functions of Babson and Hersh, we relate the M\\\"obius function of a given\ninterval in a crystal poset of simply laced or doubly laced type to the types\nof relations that can occur among crystal operators within this interval.\n  For a crystal of a highest weight representation of finite classical Cartan\ntype, we show that whenever there exists an interval whose M\\\"obius function is\nnot equal to -1, 0, or 1, there must be a relation among crystal operators\nwithin this interval not implied by Stembridge or Sternberg relations. As an\nexample of an application, this yields relations among crystal operators in\ntype $C_{n}$ that were not previously known. Additionally, by studying the\nstructure of Sternberg relations in the doubly laced case, we prove that\ncrystals of highest weight representations of types $B_{2}$ and $C_{2}$ are not\nlattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 18:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

Since a-priori knowledge from the dynamics in queue length\nof virtual machines is not known in run time, an online reinforcement learning\napproach is proposed for foresighted task allocation. The evaluation results\nshow that our method not only reduce the response time and makespan of\nsubmitted tasks, but also increase the resource efficiency. So in this thesis a\nscheduling method based on reinforcement learning is proposed. Adopting with\nenvironment conditions and responding to unsteady requests, reinforcement\nlearning can cause a long-term increase in system's performance. The results\nshow that this proposed method can not only reduce the response time and\nmakespan but also increase resource efficiency as a minor goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 19:20:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 05:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

More recently, potential environmental benefits for asteroid mining\nhave been considered. However, no quantitative estimate of these benefits has\nbeen given. This paper attempts to determine if and under which conditions\nasteroid mining would have environmental benefits, compared to either\nEarth-based mining or launching equipment and resources into space. We focus on\ntwo cases: Water supply to cis-lunar orbit and platinum mining. First, we\nconduct a state-of-the-art of current environmental life cycle assessment for\nthe space domain and platinum mining. Second, a first order environmental life\ncycle assessment is conducted, including goal and scope definition, inventory\nanalysis, and impact assessment. We compare water supply to cis-lunar orbit\nwith and without asteroid mining and go on to compare terrestrial with\nspace-based platinum mining. The results indicate that asteroid water mining\nwould have environmental benefits, as soon as the amount of water supplied via\nmining is larger than the mass of the spacecraft used for mining. For platinum\nmining, we find that by comparing the operations phase of terrestrial and space\nmining, space mining would have a lower environmental impact, if the spacecraft\nis able to return between 0.3 to 7% of its mass in platinum to Earth, assuming\n100% primary platinum or 100% secondary platinum, respectively.

However, segmentation accuracy in the VLS method dramatically\ndecreases when dealing with intervening factors such as lighting, shadows,\ncolors, etc. Additionally, results are quite sensitive to initial settings and\nare highly dependent on the number of iterations. In order to address these\nlimitations, the proposed method incorporates VLS into deep learning by\ndefining a novel end-to-end trainable model called as Deep Recurrent Level Set\n(DRLS). The proposed DRLS consists of three layers, i.e, Convolutional layers,\nDeconvolutional layers with skip connections and LevelSet layers. Brain tumor\nsegmentation is taken as an instant to illustrate the performance of the\nproposed DRLS. Convolutional layer learns visual representation of brain tumor\nat different scales. Since brain tumors occupy a small portion of the image,\ndeconvolutional layers are designed with skip connections to obtain a high\nquality feature map. Level-Set Layer drives the contour towards the brain\ntumor. In each step, the Convolutional Layer is fed with the LevelSet map to\nobtain a brain tumor feature map. This in turn serves as input for the LevelSet\nlayer in the next step. The experimental results have been obtained on\nBRATS2013, BRATS2015 and BRATS2017 datasets. The proposed DRLS model improves\nboth computational time and segmentation accuracy when compared to the the\nclassic VLS-based method. Additionally, a fully end-to-end system DRLS achieves\nstate-of-the-art segmentation on brain tumors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 21:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

However, the quality of such\nhuman-generated sensory data varies significantly among different users. To\nbetter utilize sensory data, the problem of truth discovery, whose goal is to\nestimate user quality and infer reliable aggregated results through\nquality-aware data aggregation, has emerged as a hot topic. Although the\nexisting truth discovery approaches can provide reliable aggregated results,\nthey fail to protect the private information of individual users. Moreover,\ncrowd sensing systems typically involve a large number of participants, making\nencryption or secure multi-party computation based solutions difficult to\ndeploy. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient\nprivacy-preserving truth discovery mechanism with theoretical guarantees of\nboth utility and privacy. The key idea of the proposed mechanism is to perturb\ndata from each user independently and then conduct weighted aggregation among\nusers' perturbed data. The proposed approach is able to assign user weights\nbased on information quality, and thus the aggregated results will not deviate\nmuch from the true results even when large noise is added. We adapt local\ndifferential privacy definition to this privacy-preserving task and demonstrate\nthe proposed mechanism can satisfy local differential privacy while preserving\nhigh aggregation accuracy. We formally quantify utility and privacy trade-off\nand further verify the claim by experiments on both synthetic data and a\nreal-world crowd sensing system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 22:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

However, these approaches often ignore causal\nrelationships between different levels of vehicle interactions and/or accident\ntypes and they lack a physical representation of the accident phenomena itself.\nIn this paper, a new generic probabilistic safety assessment framework for\ntraffic microscopic simulation tools is proposed. The probability of a specific\naccident occurring is estimated by an accident propensity function that\nconsists of a deterministic safety score component and a random component. The\nformulation of the safety score depends on the type of occurrence, on detailed\nvehicle interactions and maneuvers and on its representation in a simulation\nenvironment. This generic model is applied to the case of an urban motorway and\nspecified to four types of outcomes: non-accident events and three types of\naccidents in a nested structure: rear-end, lane-changing, and run-off-road\naccidents. The model was estimated and validated using simulated microscopic\ndata. To obtained the consistent simulated data, a two-step simulation\ncalibration procedure was adopted: (1) using real trajectories collected on\nsite for detailed behavior representation; and (2) using aggregate data from\neach event used in safety model estimation. The final estimated safety model is\nable to identify and interpret several simulated vehicle interactions. The fact\nthat these outcomes were extracted from simulated analysis shows the real\npotential of calibrated traffic microscopic simulation for detailed safety\nassessments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 23:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

For this\nreason, when handling problems with a linear component that is stiff and a\nnonlinear component that is not, SSP integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods\nmay offer an attractive alternative to traditional time-stepping methods. The\nstrong stability properties of integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods where\nthe transformed problem is evolved with an explicit SSP Runge--Kutta method\nwith non-decreasing abscissas was recently established.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end\nlearning scheme to keep track of the evolution of attrition patterns for the\npredictive modeling. It integrates user activity logs, dynamic and static user\nprofiles based on multi-path learning. It exploits historical user records by\nestablishing a decaying multi-snapshot technique. And finally it employs the\nprecedent user intentions via guiding them to the subsequent learning\nprocedure. As a result, it addresses all disadvantages of conventional methods.\nWe evaluate our methodology on two public data repositories and one private\nuser usage dataset provided by Adobe Creative Cloud. The extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that it can offer the appealing performance in comparison with\nseveral existing approaches as rated by different popular metrics. Furthermore,\nwe introduce an advanced interpretation and visualization strategy to\neffectively characterize the periodicity of user activity logs. It can help to\npinpoint important factors that are critical to user attrition and retention\nand thus suggests actionable improvement targets for business practice.

First, the energy band structure and\ndielectric constants were calculated for both the monolayer and multilayer\nstructures using Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with van der\nWaals (vdW) corrections. A parallel-band effect observed in the monolayer band\nstructure indicates a strong light-matter interaction. Then, based on the\ncalculated dielectric constants, the performance of the LSPR excited by Au\nsphere nanoparticles (NPs) was quantitatively characterized, including\npolarizability, scattering and absorption cross-sections, and radiative\nefficiency using Mie theory. For the multilayer HfSe2 and ZrSe2, the LSPR\nshowed very comparable intensities in both the in-plane and out-of-plane\ndirections, suggesting an isotropy-like light-matter interaction. In a\ncomparison, the LSPR excited on the monolayer HfSe2 and ZrSe2 was clearly\nobserved in the in-plane direction but effectively suppressed in the\nout-of-plane direction due to the unique anisotropic nature.

This paper analyzes the performance of PCC-OFDM in the uplink\nof a multiuser system using orthogonal frequency division multiple access\n(OFDMA) and compares it with conventional cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM), and\nuniversal filtered multicarrier (UFMC). PCC-OFDM is shown to be much less\nsensitive than either CP-OFDM or UFMC to time and frequency offsets. For a\ngiven constellation size, PCC-OFDM in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\nrequires 3dB lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a given bit-error-rate, and\nthe SNR advantage of PCC-OFDM increases rapidly when there are timing and/or\nfrequency offsets. For PCC-OFDM no frequency guard band is required between\ndifferent OFDMA users. PCC-OFDM is completely compatible with CP-OFDM and adds\nnegligible complexity and latency, as it uses a simple mapping of data onto\npairs of subcarriers at the transmitter, and a simple weighting-and-adding of\npairs of subcarriers at the receiver. The weighting and adding step, which has\nbeen omitted in some of the literature, is shown to contribute substantially to\nthe SNR advantage of PCC-OFDM. A disadvantage of PCC-OFDM (without overlapping)\nis the potential reduction in spectral efficiency because subcarriers are\nmodulated in pairs, but this reduction is more than regained because no guard\nband or cyclic prefix is required and because, for a given channel, larger\nconstellations can be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 04:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

As an\nirreplaceable sensor, LiDAR can provide continuous and high-frequency pose\nestimation by means of mapping, on condition that enough environment features\nare available. The error of mapping can accumulate over time. Therefore, LiDAR\nis usually integrated with other sensors. In diverse urban scenarios, the\nenvironment feature availability relies heavily on the traffic (moving and\nstatic objects) and the degree of urbanization. Common LiDAR-based SLAM\ndemonstrations tend to be studied in light traffic and less urbanized area.\nHowever, its performance can be severely challenged in deep urbanized cities,\nsuch as Hong Kong, Tokyo, and New York with dense traffic and tall buildings.\nThis paper proposes to analyze the performance of standalone NDT-based graph\nSLAM and its reliability estimation in diverse urban scenarios to further\nevaluate the relationship between the performance of LiDAR-based SLAM and\nscenario conditions. The normal distribution transform (NDT) is employed to\ncalculate the transformation between frames of point clouds.

Unmodeled effects violating the lambertian surface\nassumption or geometric invariances of individual residuals are encountered\nthrough statistical averaging or the addition of robust kernels and smoothness\nterms. Aiming at more accurate measurement models and the inclusion of\nhigher-order shape priors, the community more recently shifted its attention to\ndeep end-to-end models for solving geometric localization and mapping problems.\nHowever, at test-time, these feed-forward models ignore the more traditional\ngeometric or photometric consistency terms, thus leading to a low ability to\nrecover fine details and potentially complete failure in corner case scenarios.\nWith an application to dense object modeling from RGBD images, our work aims at\ntaking the best of both worlds by embedding modern higher-order object shape\npriors into classical iterative residual minimization objectives. We\ndemonstrate a general ability to improve mapping accuracy with respect to each\nmodality alone, and present a successful application to real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 08:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

Moreover, given its world-wide distribution in diverse\nhabitats and its moderate genome-size, Drosophila has proven very powerful for\npopulation genetics inference and was one of the first eukaryotes whose genome\nwas fully sequenced. In this book-chapter, we provide a brief historical\noverview of research in Drosophila and then focus on recent advances during the\ngenomic era. After describing different types and sources of genomic data, we\ndiscuss mechanisms of neutral evolution including the demographic history of\nDrosophila and the effects of recombination and biased gene conversion. Then,\nwe review recent advances in detecting genome-wide signals of selection, such\nas soft and hard selective sweeps. We further provide a brief introduction to\nbackground selection, selection of non-coding DNA and codon usage and focus on\nthe role of structural variants, such as transposable elements and chromosomal\ninversions, during the adaptive process. Finally, we discuss how genomic data\nhelps to dissect neutral and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms that shape\ngenetic and phenotypic variation in natural populations along environmental\ngradients. In summary, this book chapter serves as a starting point to\nDrosophila population genomics and provides an introduction to the system and\nan overview to data sources, important population genetic concepts and recent\nadvances in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 09:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

Our\nresults reveal that a symmetrical distribution of alkali atoms leads to a\nhigher stability value such that stable structures with moderate alkali\nconcentrations can be obtained provided that the alkali atoms are allowed to\nsettle into a symmetrical distribution. We investigate the associated\nstructural mechanisms by calculating the migration barriers of alkali atoms\nwithin the material, the electronic charge distribution in the material and the\nvariation of basal spacing by using both computational methods and X-ray\ndiffraction analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 09:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

We consider two types of\nparticles, called positive and negative. Same-sign particles repel each other,\nand opposite-sign particles attract each other. The interaction potential is\nthe same for all particles, up to the sign, and has a logarithmic singularity\nat zero. The central example of such systems is that of dislocations in\ncrystals.\n  Because of the singularity in the interaction potential, the discrete\nevolution leads to blow-up in finite time. We remedy this situation by\nregularising the interaction potential at a length-scale $\\delta_n>0$, which\nconverges to zero as the number of particles $n$ tends to infinity.\n  We establish two main results. The first one is an evolutionary convergence\nresult showing that the empirical measures of the positive and of the negative\nparticles converge to a solution of a set of coupled PDEs which describe the\nevolution of their continuum densities. In the setting of dislocations these\nPDEs are known as the Groma-Balogh equations. In the proof we rely on the\ntheory of $\\lambda$-convex gradient flows, a priori estimates for the\nGroma-Balogh equations and Orlicz spaces. The proof require $\\delta_n$ to\nconverge to zero sufficiently slowly. The second result is a counterexample,\ndemonstrating that if $\\delta_n$ converges to zero sufficiently fast, then the\nlimits of the empirical measures of the positive and the negative dislocations\ndo not satisfy the Groma-Balogh equations.\n  These results show how the validity of the Groma-Balogh equations as the\nlimit of many-particle systems depends in a subtle way on the scale at which\nthe singularity of the potential is regularised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 09:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

The latter are connected to the grid via\ninverters and as such have little, if any rotational inertia. The resulting\nreduction of total inertia raises important issues of power grid stability,\nespecially over short-time scales. We have constructed a model of the\nsynchronous grid of continental Europe with which we numerically investigate\nfrequency deviations as well as rates of change of frequency (RoCoF) following\nabrupt power losses. The magnitude of RoCoF's and frequency deviations strongly\ndepend on the fault location, and we find the largest effects for faults\nlocated on the slowest mode - the Fiedler mode - of the network Laplacian\nmatrix. This mode essentially vanishes over Belgium, Eastern France, Western\nGermany, northern Italy and Switzerland. Buses inside these regions are only\nweakly affected by faults occuring outside. Conversely, faults inside these\nregions have only a local effect and disturb only weakly outside buses.\nFollowing this observation, we reduce rotational inertia through three\ndifferent procedures by either (i) reducing inertia on the Fiedler mode, (ii)\nreducing inertia homogeneously and (iii) reducing inertia outside the Fiedler\nmode. We find that procedure (iii) has little effect on disturbance\npropagation, while procedure (i) leads to the strongest increase of RoCoF and\nfrequency deviations.

The upper\nsign holds for the positive helicity spinors, while the lower sign for the\nnegative helicity spinors. For $\\vartheta = 2\\pi$ radians this produces the\nfamous minus sign.

The effect of the rotation by\n$2\\pi$ radians on the eigenspinors of the parity - that is, the Dirac spinors\n-- is the same as on Weyl spinors. It is because for these spinors the right-\nand left- transforming components have the same helicity. And the rotation\ninduced phases, being same, factor out. But for the eigenspinors of the charge\nconjugation operator, i.e. Elko, the left- and right- transforming components\nhave opposite helicities, and therefore they pick up opposite phases.

We present a way to overcome this\nlimitations by combining a robust and inexpensive fiber laser for nonlinear\nexcitation with a fast analog digitization method for rapid FLIM imaging. The\napplied sub nanosecond pulsed laser source is synchronized to a high analog\nbandwidth signal detection for single shot TPEF- and single shot FLIM imaging.\nThe actively modulated pulses at 1064nm from the fiber laser are adjustable\nfrom 50ps to 5ns with kW of peak power. At a typically applied pulse lengths\nand repetition rates, the duty cycle is comparable to typically used\nfemtosecond pulses and thus the peak power is also comparable at same cw-power.\nHence, both types of excitation should yield the same number of fluorescence\nphotons per time on average when used for TPEF imaging. However, in the 100ps\nconfiguration, a thousand times more fluorescence photons are generated per\npulse. In this paper, we now show that the higher number of fluorescence\nphotons per pulse combined with a high analog bandwidth detection makes it\npossible to not only use a single pulse per pixel for TPEF imaging but also to\nresolve the exponential time decay for FLIM.

Among the\nlatter are nonlocal aspects of single particles which have been of major\ninterest. In this paper, the nonlocality of single quanta is studied in a\nsquare nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer with spatially separated detectors\nusing a delayed choice modification of quantum measurement outcomes that depend\non the complex-valued weak values. We show that if spacelike separated Bob and\nAlice are allowed to freely control their quantum devices, the geometry of the\nsetup constrains the local hidden variables models. In particular, hidden\nsignaling and a list of contextual instructions are required to split a quantum\nstate characterized by a positive Wigner function into two quantum states with\nnon-positive Wigner functions. This implies that local hidden variables models\ncould rely neither on only two hidden variables for position and momentum, nor\non simultaneous factorizability of both the hidden probability densities and\nweights of splitting to reproduce the correct quantum distributions. While our\nanalysis does not fully exclude the existence of nonfactorizable local hidden\nvariables models, it demonstrates that the recently proposed weak values of\nquantum histories necessitate contextual splitting of prior commitments to\nmeasurement outcomes, due to functional dependence on the total Feynman sum\nthat yields the complex-valued quantum probability amplitude for the studied\nquantum transition.

We show that it is a good definition in the following sense: (1)\nIt divides the set of states into equivalent classes and it establishes a\npartial order between those according to their level of \"topological\ncomplexity\". (2) It provides a path between any two states belonging to the\nsame phase where observables behave smoothly. We then focus on pure states to\nrelate the new definition in this particular case with the usual definition for\nquantum phases of closed systems in terms of the existence of a gapped path of\nHamiltonians connecting both states in the corresponding ground state path. We\nshow first that if two pure states are in the same phase in the Hamiltonian\nsense, they are also in the same phase in the Lindbladian sense considered\nhere. We then turn to analyse the reverse implication, where we point out a\nvery different behaviour in the case of symmetry protected topological (SPT)\nphases in 1D. Whereas at the Hamiltonian level, phases are known to be\nclassified with the second cohomology group of the symmetry group, we show that\nsymmetry cannot give any protection in 1D in the Lindbladian sense: there is\nonly one SPT phase in 1D independently of the symmetry group. We finish\nanalysing the case of 2D topological quantum systems. There we expect that\ndifferent topological phases in the Hamiltonian sense remain different in the\nLindbladian sense.

With the advancement in\ntechnology and rapidly increasing of the complexity of the business\nenvironment, it has become more competitive than the past so that efficiency\nanalysis in the banking industry attracts much attention in recent years. From\nmany aspects, such analyses at the branch level are more desirable. Evaluating\nthe branch performance with the purpose of eliminating deficiency can be a\ncrucial issue for branch managers to measure branch efficiency. This work not\nonly can lead to a better understanding of bank branch performance but also\ngive further information to enhance managerial decisions to recognize\nproblematic areas. To achieve this purpose, this study presents an integrated\napproach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Clustering algorithms and\nPolynomial Pattern Classifier for constructing a classifier to identify a class\nof bank branches. First, the efficiency estimates of individual branches are\nevaluated by using the DEA approach. Next, when the range and number of classes\nwere identified by experts, the number of clusters is identified by an\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm based on some statistical\nmethods. Next, we divide our raw data into k clusters By means of\nself-organizing map (SOM) neural networks. Finally, all clusters are fed into\nthe reduced multivariate polynomial model to predict the classes of data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 18:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

The proposed method is applied to the semi-synthetic\nWatt field.

The limits of the regimes of\nreaction wave propagation depend upon the spontaneous wave speed and the\ncharacteristic velocities of the problem. The present study mainly focus to\nidentify conditions required for the development a detonation and to compare\nthe difference between simplified chemical models and detailed chemistry. It is\nshown that a widely used simplified chemical schemes, such as one-step,\ntwo-step and other simplified models, do not reproduce correctly the ignition\nprocess in methane/air mixtures. The ignition delay times calculated using\nsimplified models are in orders of magnitude shorter than the ignition delay\ntimes calculated using detailed chemical models and measured experimentally.\nThis results in considerably different times when the exothermic reaction\naffects significantly the ignition, evolution, and coupling of the spontaneous\nreaction wave and pressure waves. We show that the temperature gradient capable\nto trigger detonation calculated using detailed chemical models is much\nshallower (the size of the hot spot is much larger) than that, predicted by\nsimulations with simplified chemical models. These findings suggest that the\nscenario leading to the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) may depend\ngreatly on the chemical model used in simulations and that the Zeldovich\ngradient mechanism is not necessary a universal mechanism triggering DDT. The\nobtained results indicate that the conclusions derived from the simulations of\nDDT with simplified chemical models should be viewed with great caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 12:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}
