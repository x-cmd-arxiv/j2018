Many measures based on the network topology have emerged over the\nyears to identify influential nodes such as Betweenness, Closeness, and\nEigenvalue centrality. However, although most real-world networks are modular,\nfew measures exploit this property. Recent works have shown that it has a\nsignificant effect on the dynamics on networks. In a modular network, a node\nhas two types of influence: a local influence (on the nodes of its community)\nthrough its intra-community links and a global influence (on the nodes in other\ncommunities) through its inter-community links. Depending of the strength of\nthe community structure, these two components are more or less influential.\nBased on this idea, we propose to extend all the standard centrality measures\ndefined for networks with no community structure to modular networks. The\nso-called \"Modular centrality\" is a two dimensional vector. Its first component\nquantifies the local influence of a node in its community while the second\ncomponent quantifies its global influence on the other communities of the\nnetwork. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the Modular centrality\nextensions, comparison with their scalar counterpart are performed in an\nepidemic process setting. Simulation results using the\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on synthetic networks with\ncontrolled community structure allows getting a clear idea about the relation\nbetween the strength of the community structure and the major type of influence\n(global/local). Furthermore, experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the\nmerit of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 21:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

As for the case when the eavesdropper's ICSI\nis unknown, we also propose an SEEM scheme through using the statistical CSI\n(SCSI) of the eavesdropper, namely SCSI based SEEM (SCSI-SEEM) scheme. Since\nthe ICSI-SEEM and SCSI-SEEM problems are fractional and non-convex, we first\ntransform them into equivalent subtractive problems, and then achieve\napproximate convex problems through employing the difference of two-convex\nfunctions approximation method. Finally, new two-tier power allocation\nalgorithms are proposed to achieve $\\varepsilon$-optimal solutions of our\nformulated ICSI-SEEM and SCSI-SEEM problems. Simulation results illustrate that\nthe ICSI-SEEM has a better secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) performance than\nSCSI-SEEM, and moreover, the proposed ICSI-SEEM and SCSI-SEEM schemes\noutperform conventional SR maximization and EE maximization approaches in terms\nof their SEE performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 17:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

To trigger this process, it has been\nargued that sedimentation of solids onto the mid-plane needs to be efficient\nand therefore that a quiescent gaseous environment is required. It is often\nsuggested that dead-zone or disk-wind structure created by non-ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects meets this requirement. However,\nsimulations have shown that the midplane of a dead zone is not completely\nquiescent.

We systematically compare the evolution of the system\nwith ideal or non-ideal MHD, with or without back-reaction drag force from\nparticles on gas, and with varying solid abundances. Similar to previous\ninvestigations of dead zone dynamics, we find that particles of dimensionless\nstopping time $\\tau_s=0.1$ do not sediment appreciably more than those in ideal\nmagneto-rotational turbulence, resulting in a vertical scale height an order of\nmagnitude larger than in a laminar disk. Contrary to the expectation that this\nshould curb the formation of planetesimals, we nevertheless find that strong\nclumping of solids still occurs in the dead zone when solid abundances are\nsimilar to the critical value for a laminar environment. This can be explained\nby the weak radial diffusion of particles near the mid-plane. The results imply\nthat the sedimentation of particles to the mid-plane is not a necessary\ncriterion for the formation of planetesimals by the streaming instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

The 16 Myr old star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen) underwent\na series of complex eclipses in May 2007, interpreted as the transit of a giant\nHill sphere filling debris ring system around a secondary companion, J1407b. No\nother eclipses have since been detected, although other measurements have\nconstrained but not uniquely determined the orbital period of J1407b. Finding\nanother eclipse towards J1407 will help determine the orbital period of the\nsystem, the geometry of the proposed ring system and enable planning of further\nobservations to characterize the material within these putative rings. Aims. We\ncarry out a search for other eclipses in photometric data of J1407 with the aim\nof constraining the orbital period of J1407b. Methods. We present photometry\nfrom archival photographic plates from the Harvard DASCH survey, and Bamberg\nand Sonneberg Observatories, in order to place additional constraints on the\norbital period of J1407b by searching for other dimming and eclipse events.\nUsing a visual inspection of all 387 plates and a period-folding algorithm we\nperformed a search for other eclipses in these data sets. Results. We find no\nother deep eclipses in the data spanning from 1890 to 1990, nor in recent\ntime-series photometry from 2012-2018. Conclusions. We rule out a large\nfraction of putative orbital periods for J1407b from 5 to 20 years. These\nlimits are still marginally consistent with a large Hill sphere filling ring\nsystem surrounding a brown dwarf companion in a bound elliptical orbit about\nJ1407. Issues with the stability of any rings combined with the lack of\ndetection of another eclipse, suggests that J1407b may not be bound to J1407.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Because\nthis signal is very faint and difficult to isolate, it is crucial to develop\nanalysis techniques that maximize sensitivity and suppress contaminants in\ndata. It is also imperative to understand the trade-offs between different\nanalysis methods and their effects on power spectrum estimates. Specifically,\nwith a statistical power spectrum detection in HERA's foreseeable future, it\nhas become increasingly important to understand how certain analysis choices\ncan lead to the loss of the EoR signal.

Together with the analytic solutions to lp-norm minimization with\ntwo specific values of p, i.e., p=1/2 and p=2/3, we propose two novel bilinear\nfactor matrix norm minimization models for robust principal component analysis.\nWe first define the double nuclear norm and Frobenius/nuclear hybrid norm\npenalties, and then prove that they are in essence the Schatten-1/2 and 2/3\nquasi-norms, respectively, which lead to much more tractable and scalable\nLipschitz optimization problems.

As a main result, we propose several\nchanges to the existing annotation guidelines with a goal of making the\nextracted app features more useful and informative to the app developers. We\ntest the proposed changes via simulating the application of the new annotation\nguidelines and then evaluating the performance of the supervised machine\nlearning models trained on datasets annotated with initial and simulated\nguidelines. While the overall performance of automatic app feature extraction\nremains the same as compared to the model trained on the dataset with initial\nannotations, the features extracted by the model trained on the dataset with\nsimulated new annotations are less noisy and more informative to the app\ndevelopers. Secondly, we are interested in what kind of annotated training data\nis necessary for training an automatic app feature extraction model. In\nparticular, we explore whether the training set should contain annotated app\nreviews from those apps/app categories on which the model is subsequently\nplanned to be applied, or is it sufficient to have annotated app reviews from\nany app available for training, even when these apps are from very different\ncategories compared to the test app. Our experiments show that having annotated\ntraining reviews from the test app is not necessary although including them\ninto training set helps to improve recall. Furthermore, we test whether\naugmenting the training set with annotated product reviews helps to improve the\nperformance of app feature extraction. We find that the models trained on\naugmented training set lead to improved recall but at the cost of the drop in\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

Assuming the impermeability of the bubble\nwall to both species, diffusion driven by pressure gradients and classical\nFick-diffusion must cancel at the bubble wall, so that an oscillatory\nconcentration gradient arises in the vicinity of the bubble. The Peclet number\nPe is generally high in typical situations and Fick diffusion cannot restore\nequilibrium immediately, so that an asymptotic average concentration profile\nmay progressively build up in the liquid over large times. Such a behavior is\nreminiscent of the so-called rectified diffusion problem, leading to slow\ngrowth of gas bubble oscillating in a sound field. A rigorous method formerly\nproposed by Fyrillas & Szeri (1994) to solve the latter problem is used in this\npaper to solve the present one. It is based on splitting the problem into a\nsmooth part and an oscillatory part. [...] For driving pressures sufficiently\nhigh to yield inertial oscillations of the bubble, the oscillatory problem\npredicts a periodic peak excess concentration of the heaviest species at the\nbubble wall at each collapse, lingering on several tens of time the\ncharacteristic duration of the bubble rebound. The two effects may compete for\nlarge molecules and practical implications of this segregation phenomenon are\nproposed for various processes involving acoustic cavitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

Using Density Functional Theory, we found\nthere are two distinct oxygen interstitial diffusion mechanisms involving two\ndifferent oxygen interstitial species that can be active in La2-xSrxNiO4+delta,\nand, we believe, in hyperstoichiometric RP oxides in general. The first\nmechanism is the previously proposed interstitialcy-mediated mechanism, which\nconsists of diffusing oxide interstitials. The second mechanism is newly\ndiscovered in this work, and consists of both oxide and peroxide interstitial\nspecies. This mechanism exhibits a similar or possibly lower migration barrier\nthan the interstitialcy mechanism for high oxidation states. Which mechanism\ncontributes to the oxygen interstitial diffusion is the result of the change in\nrelative stability between the oxide interstitial and peroxide interstitial.\nThe stability of the oxide and peroxide, and the competition between the two\noxygen diffusion mechanisms, is sensitive to the overall oxidation state of the\nsystem. Therefore, the oxygen diffusion mechanism is a function of the material\ncomposition, oxygen off-stoichiometry, operating temperature and oxygen partial\npressure. We also examined the effect of epitaxial strain on both oxygen\ndiffusion mechanisms, and found that tensile and compressive epitaxial strain\nof up to 2% had less than 100 meV/(% strain) effects on oxygen interstitial\nformation, migration, and activation energies, and that total achievable\nactivation energy reductions are likely less than 100 meV for -2% to +2%\nepitaxial strain.

In recent years, autoencoders\nhave been shown to be effective anomaly detectors that train only on \"normal\"\ndata. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate\nadditional training samples for classifiers, thus making them more accurate and\nrobust. However, in anomaly detection GANs are only used to reconstruct\nexisting samples rather than to generate additional ones. This stems both from\nthe small amount and lack of diversity of anomalous data in most domains. In\nthis study we propose MDGAN, a novel GAN architecture for improving anomaly\ndetection through the generation of additional samples. Our approach uses two\ndiscriminators: a dense network for determining whether the generated samples\nare of sufficient quality (i.e., valid) and an autoencoder that serves as an\nanomaly detector. MDGAN enables us to reconcile two conflicting goals: 1)\ngenerate high-quality samples that can fool the first discriminator, and 2)\ngenerate samples that can eventually be effectively reconstructed by the second\ndiscriminator, thus improving its performance.

It should respect a multitude of requirements,\nranging from simplicity, generality, and representativity of known theories to\ncomputational efficiency.

The goal is to assign each jobs to\nmachines in order to minimize the expected $l_p$-norm of the total load on the\nmachines. While convex relaxations represent one of the most powerful\nalgorithmic tools, in problems such as SLBp the main difficulty is to capture\nthe objective function in a way that only depends on each random variable\nseparately.\n  We show how to capture $p$-power-type objectives in such separable way by\nusing the $L$-function method, introduced by Lata{\\l}a to relate the moment of\nsums of random variables to the individual marginals.

Within the context\nof estimating DI, we show that, because joint Markovicity of a pair of\nprocesses does not imply the marginal Markovicity of individual processes,\ncommonly used plug-in estimators of DI will be biased for a large subset of\njointly Markov processes. We introduce a notion of DI with \"stale history\",\nwhich can be combined with a plug-in estimator to upper and lower bound the DI\nwhen marginal Markovicity does not hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 21:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 20:26:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Thus an ideal SPI\nsearch consists of multiple epochs containing observations on consecutive\nnights spanning at least one complete planetary orbit.

For\ninstance, the wireless channel may often be dominated by a finite number of\nspecular components, the conventional Gaussian assumption may not be applied to\nthe diffuse scattered waves and the point scatterers may be inhomogeneously\ndistributed. These physical attributes were incorporated into the\nstate-of-the-art fading models, such as the kappa-mu shadowed fading model, the\ngeneralized two-ray fading model, and the fluctuating two ray fading model.\nUnfortunately, much of the existing published work commonly imposed arbitrary\nassumptions on the channel parameters to achieve theoretical tractability,\nthereby limiting their application to represent a diverse range of propagation\nenvironments. This motivates us to find a more general fading model that\nincorporates multiple specular components with clusterized diffuse scattered\nwaves, but achieves analytical tractability at the same time. To this end, we\nintroduced the Multiple-Waves with Generalized Diffuse Scatter (MWGD) and\nFluctuating Multiple-Ray (FMR) model that allow an arbitrary number of specular\ncomponents and assume generalized diffuse scattered model. We derive the\ndistribution functions of the signal envelop in closed form and calculate\nsecond order statistics of the proposed fading model. Furthermore, we evaluate\nthe performance metrics of wireless communications systems, such as the\ncapacity, outage probability, and average bit error rate. Through numerical\nsimulations, we obtain important new insights into the link performance of the\n5G communications while considering a diverse range of fading conditions and\nchannel characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 21:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

During\npruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and\nimportant weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make\nseveral surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all\nstate-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a\npruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that\nmodel with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a\npredefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline\nand directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are\nconsistent for multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks, which imply\nthat: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is often not necessary to\nobtain an efficient final model, 2) learned \"important\" weights of the large\nmodel are typically not useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned\narchitecture itself, rather than a set of inherited \"important\" weights, is\nmore crucial to the efficiency in the final model, which suggests that in some\ncases pruning can be useful as an architecture search paradigm. Our results\nsuggest the need for more careful baseline evaluations in future research on\nstructured pruning methods. We also compare with the \"Lottery Ticket\nHypothesis\" (Frankle & Carbin 2019), and find that with optimal learning rate,\nthe \"winning ticket\" initialization as used in Frankle & Carbin (2019) does not\nbring improvement over random initialization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 22:15:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 05:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

The binary\norbit has a period of approximately 50 years, with the most recent periastron\noccurring on 2017 November 13. Our observations span from 18 months prior to\nperiastron to one month after. A new, point-like, gamma-ray source is detected,\ncoincident with the location of PSR J2032+4127 / MT91 213. The gamma-ray light\ncurve and spectrum are well-characterized over the periastron passage. The flux\nis variable over at least an order of magnitude, peaking at periastron, thus\nproviding a firm association of the TeV source with the pulsar / Be star\nsystem. Observations prior to periastron show a cutoff in the spectrum at an\nenergy around 0.5 TeV.

Here we revisit\nthe Superfast Encoding introduced by Kitaev and one of the authors. This\nencoding maps a target fermionic Hamiltonian with two-body interactions on a\ngraph of degree $d$ to a qubit simulator Hamiltonian composed of Pauli\noperators of weight $O(d)$. A system of $m$ fermi modes gets mapped to\n$n=O(md)$ qubits. We propose Generalized Superfast Encodings (GSE) which\nrequire the same number of qubits as the original one but have more favorable\nproperties. First, we describe a GSE such that the corresponding quantum code\ncorrects any single-qubit error provided that the interaction graph has degree\n$d\\ge 6$. In contrast, we prove that the original Superfast Encoding lacks the\nerror correction property for $d\\le 6$. Secondly, we describe a GSE that\nreduces the Pauli weight of the simulator Hamiltonian from $O(d)$ to\n$O(\\log{d})$. The robustness against errors and a simplified structure of the\nsimulator Hamiltonian offered by GSEs can make simulation of fermionic systems\nwithin the reach of near-term quantum devices.

That $N$-a-gonland is\nmore generally $CP^{N - 2}$ (with $CP^1 = S^2$ recovering the triangleland\nsphere) follows from Kendall's extremization that is habitually used in Shape\nTheory, or the generalized Hopf map. We further explain our observation of\nnon-extension in terms of total area not providing a shape quantity for\nquadrilaterals. It is rather the square root of of sums of squares of subsystem\nareas that provides a shape quantity; we clarify this further in\nrepresentation-theoretic terms. The triangleland $S^2$ moreover also\ngeneralizes to $d$-simplexlands being $S^{d(d + 1)/2 - 1}$ topologically by\nCasson's observation. For the 3-simplex - alias tetrahaedron - while volume\nprovides a shape quantity and is specified by the della Francesca-Tartaglia\nformula, the analogue of finding Heron eigenvectors is undefined. $d$-volume\nmoreover provides a shape quantity for the $d$-simplex, specified by the\nCayley-Menger formula generalization of the Heron and della Francesca-Tartaglia\nformulae. While eigenvectors can be defined for the even-$d$ Cayley-Menger\nformulae, the dimension count does not however work out for these to provide\non-sphere conditions. We finally point out the multiple dimensional\ncoincidences behind the derivation of the space of triangles from Heron's\nformula. This article is a useful check on how far the least technically\ninvolved derivation of the smallest nontrivial shape space can be taken. This\nis significant since Shape Theory is a futuristic branch of mathematics, with\nsubstantial applications in both Statistics (Shape Statistics) and Theoretical\nPhysics (Background Independence: of major relevance to Classical and Quantum\nGravitational Theory).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 22:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

Researchers using survey or experimental\npanel data sets on prices and consumption to answer this question face the\nwell-known problem of measurement error. We show that ignoring measurement\nerror in the RP approach may lead to overrejection of the UMT. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a new statistical RP framework for consumption panel data\nsets that allows for testing the UMT in the presence of measurement error. Our\ntest is applicable to all consumer models that can be characterized by their\nfirst-order conditions. Our approach is nonparametric, allows for unrestricted\nheterogeneity in preferences, and requires only a centering condition on\nmeasurement error.

There are two main approaches to handle the surge in the uplink (UL)\ntraffic the IoT is expected to generate, namely, Scheduled UL (SC-UL) and\nrandom access uplink (RA-UL) transmissions. SC-UL is perceived as a viable tool\nto control Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels while entailing some overhead in the\nscheduling request prior to any UL transmission. On the other hand, RA-UL is a\nsimple single-phase transmission strategy. While this obviously eliminates\nscheduling overheads, very little is known about how scalable RA-UL is.

We first show\nthat any global symmetry, discrete or continuous, in a bulk quantum gravity\ntheory with a CFT dual would lead to an inconsistency in that CFT, and thus\nthat there are no bulk global symmetries in AdS/CFT. We then argue that any\n\"long-range\" bulk gauge symmetry leads to a global symmetry in the boundary\nCFT, whose consistency requires the existence of bulk dynamical objects which\ntransform in all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the bulk\ngauge group. We mostly assume that all internal symmetry groups are compact,\nbut we also give a general condition on CFTs, which we expect to be true quite\nbroadly, which implies this. We extend all of these results to the case of\nhigher-form symmetries. Finally we extend a recently proposed new motivation\nfor the weak gravity conjecture to more general gauge groups, reproducing the\n\"convex hull condition\" of Cheung and Remmen.\n  An essential point, which we dwell on at length, is precisely defining what\nwe mean by gauge and global symmetries in the bulk and boundary.

We show that MWU converges almost always for\nsmall enough stepsizes to critical points that satisfy the second order KKT\nconditions. We combine techniques from dynamical systems as well as taking\nadvantage of a recent connection between Baum Eagon inequality and MWU\n(Palaiopanos et al).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 04:56:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 06:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 04:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

However, hierarchical clustering typically has time complexity\nof $O(n^2 \\log n)$ where $n$ is the number of instances, and is difficult to\nscale to large data sets associated with GPS data. Furthermore, incremental\nhierarchical clustering is still a developing area. Prefix trees (also called\ntries) can be efficiently constructed and updated in linear time (in $n$).

Consequently, in this work, we\npresent an approach for learning to synthesize a photo-realistic image from a\nface sketch in an unsupervised fashion. In contrast to current unsupervised\nimage-to-image translation techniques, our framework leverages a novel\nperceptual discriminator to learn the geometry of human face. Learning facial\nprior information empowers the network to remove the geometrical artifacts in\nthe face sketch. We demonstrate that a simultaneous optimization of the face\nphoto generator network, employing the proposed perceptual discriminator in\ncombination with a texture-wise discriminator, results in a significant\nimprovement in quality and recognition rate of the synthesized photos.

Here, we present\ntwo complementary approaches to deriving coarse-grained descriptions of\ncollective behaviour at so-called mesoscopic scales, which account for the\nstochasticity arising from the finite sizes of animal groups. We construct\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs) for a coarse-grained variable that\ndescribes the order/consensus within a group. The first method of construction\nis based on van Kampen's system-size expansion of transition rates. The second\nmethod employs Gillespie's chemical Langevin equations. We apply these two\nmethods to two microscopic models from the literature, in which organisms\nstochastically interact and choose between two directions/choices of foraging.\nThese `binary-choice' models differ only in the types of interactions between\nindividuals, with one assuming simple pair-wise interactions, and the other\nincorporating higher-order effects. In both cases, the derived mesoscopic SDEs\nhave multiplicative, or state-dependent, noise. However, the different models\ndemonstrate the contrasting effects of noise: increasing order in the pair-wise\ninteraction model, whilst reducing order in the higher-order interaction model.\nAlthough both methods yield identical SDEs for such binary-choice, or\none-dimensional, systems, the relative tractability of the chemical Langevin\napproach is beneficial in generalizations to higher-dimensions.

Moreover, ADAF is rather robust to imperfect AoA knowledge and side\ncluster of scatterers, making itself promising for multiuser uplink\ntransmission. We also analyze the performance of CFO estimation and obtain an\napproximated closed-form expression of mean-squared error (MSE). The\neffectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over the existing\nmethods are demonstrated by numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 07:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The interaction of ammonia ices with other\nhydrogen-boding molecules such as methanol or water and their behavior upon an\nionization are thus relevant in the astrochemical context. In this study,\nammonia clusters (NH3)N with the mean size N ~230 were prepared in molecular\nbeams and passed through a pickup cell in which methanol molecules were\nadsorbed. At the highest exploited pickup pressures, the average composition of\n(NH3)N(CH3OH)M clusters was estimated to be N:M ~210:10. On the other hand, the\nelectron ionization of these clusters yielded about 75% of methanol-containing\nfragments (NH3)n(CH3OH)mH+ compared to 25% contribution of pure ammonia\n(NH3)nH+ ions. Based on this substantial disproportion, we propose the\nfollowing ionization mechanism: The prevailing ammonia is ionized in most\ncases, resulting in NH+4 core solvated most likely with four ammonia molecules,\nyielding the well-known \"magic number\" structure (NH3)4NH+4 . The methanol\nmolecules exhibit strong propensity for sticking to the fragment ion. We have\nalso considered mechanisms of intracluster reactions. In most cases, proton\ntransfer between ammonia units take place. The theoretical calculations\nsuggested the proton transfer either from the methyl group or from the hydroxyl\ngroup of the ionized methanol molecule to ammonia to be the energetically open\nchannels. However, the experiments with selectively deuterated methanols did\nnot show any evidence for the D+ transfer from the CD3 group. The proton\ntransfer from the hydroxyl group could not be excluded entirely nor confirmed\nunambiguously by the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 09:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

Topic models play a central role in this approach and,\nhence, their quality is crucial to the efficacy of measuring topical diversity.\nThe quality of topic models is affected by two causes: generality and impurity\nof topics.

In this work, a mid-infrared spectral-domain optical coherence\ntomography system operating at 4 micron central wavelength with an axial\nresolution of 8.6 microns is demonstrated. The system produces 2D\ncross-sectional images in real-time enabled by a high-brightness 0.9-4.7 micron\nmid-infrared supercontinuum source with 1 MHz pulse repetition rate for\nillumination and broadband upconversion of more than 1 micron bandwidth from\n3.58-4.63 microns to 820-865 nm, where a standard 800 nm spectrometer can be\nused for fast detection.

The influence of the pericardium is essential for predictive\nmechanical simulations of the heart. However, there is no consensus on\nphysiologically correct and computationally tractable pericardial boundary\nconditions. Here we propose to model the pericardial influence as a parallel\nspring and dashpot acting in normal direction to the epicardium.

In general, it is well-known that any online routing\nstrategy performs very poor in the worst case. The main difficulty are\nuncovered regions within the wireless ad hoc network, which we denote as radio\nholes. Complex shapes of radio holes, for example zig-zag-shapes, make local\ngeometric routing even more difficult, i.e., forwarded messages in direction to\nthe destination might get stuck in a dead end or are routed along very long\ndetours, when there is no knowledge about the ad hoc network. To obtain\nknowledge about the position and shape of radio holes, we make use of a hybrid\nnetwork approach. This approach assumes that we can not just make use of the ad\nhoc network but also of some cellular infrastructure, which is used to gather\nknowledge about the underlying ad hoc network. Communication via the cellular\ninfrastructure incurs costs as cell phone providers are involved. Therefore, we\nuse the cellular infrastructure only to compute routing paths in the ad hoc\nnetwork. The actual data transmission takes place in the ad hoc network. In\norder to find good routing paths we aim at computing an abstraction of the ad\nhoc network in which radio holes are abstracted by bounding boxes. The\nadvantage of bounding boxes as hole abstraction is that we only have to\nconsider a constant number of nodes per hole. We prove that bounding boxes are\na suitable hole abstraction that allows us to find $c$-competitive paths in the\nad hoc network in case of non-intersecting bounding boxes. In case of\nintersecting bounding boxes, we show via simulations that our routing strategy\nsignificantly outperforms the so far best online routing strategies for\nwireless ad hoc networks.

These vehicles need\nto be charged and will therefore cause congestion in local distribution grids\nin the future. Motivated by this, we consider a charging station with finitely\nmany parking spaces, in which electric vehicles arrive in order to get charged.\nAn EV has a random parking time and a random charging time. Both the charging\nrate per vehicle and the charging rate possible for the station are assumed to\nbe limited. Thus, the charging rate of uncharged EVs depends on the number of\ncars charging simultaneously. This model leads to a layered queueing network in\nwhich parking spaces with EV chargers have a dual role, of a server (to cars)\nand customers (to the grid). We are interested in the performance of the\naforementioned model, focusing on the fraction of vehicles that get fully\ncharged. To do so, we develop several bounds and asymptotic (fluid and\ndiffusion) approximations for the vector process, which describes the total\nnumber of EVs and the number of not fully charged EVs in the charging station,\nand we compare these bounds and approximations with numerical outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 12:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-15"}

First, we build on work of\nConradi, Feliu, Mincheva, and Wiuf, who showed that for certain reaction\nnetworks whose steady states admit a positive parametrization,\nmultistationarity is characterized by whether a certain \"critical function\"\nchanges sign. Here, we allow for more general parametrizations, which make it\nmuch easier to determine the existence of a sign change.

We consider a general model where the resource consumption\ndistribution associated with each (customer type, action)-combination is not\nknown, but is consistent and can be learned over time. In addition, the\nsequence of customer types to arrive over time is arbitrary and completely\nunknown.\n  We overcome both the challenges of model uncertainty and customer\nheterogeneity by judiciously synthesizing two algorithmic frameworks from the\nliterature: inventory balancing, which \"reserves\" a portion of each resource\nfor high-reward customer types which could later arrive, and online learning,\nwhich shows how to \"explore\" the resource consumption distributions of each\ncustomer type under different actions. We define an auxiliary problem, which\nallows for existing competitive ratio and regret bounds to be seamlessly\nintegrated.

We introduce a universal node and thus\nprocess the question and its context passage as a single contiguous sequence of\ntokens. The universal node encodes the fused information from both the question\nand passage, and plays an important role to predict whether the question is\nanswerable and also greatly improves the conciseness of the U-Net. Different\nfrom the state-of-art pipeline models, U-Net can be learned in an end-to-end\nfashion.

Consequently, their corresponding energetically\nconjugate stresses are non-physical and cannot represent the state of internal\nstresses in the continuum. Furthermore, the governing equations in these\ntheories do not describe the motion of infinitesimal elements of matter\nconsistently.

Specifically, we study a scenario where EV charging is managed\nthrough self-interested EV aggregators who compete in the day-ahead market in\norder to purchase the electricity needed to meet their clients' requirements.\nWith the aim of reducing electricity costs and lowering the impact on\nelectricity markets, a centralised bidding coordination framework has been\nproposed in the literature employing a coordinator. In order to improve privacy\nand limit the need for the coordinator, we propose a reformulation of the\ncoordination framework as a decentralised algorithm, employing the Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (ADMM). However, given the self-interested\nnature of the aggregators, they can deviate from the algorithm in order to\nreduce their energy costs. Hence, we study the strategic manipulation of the\nADMM algorithm and, in doing so, describe and analyse different possible attack\nvectors and propose a mathematical framework to quantify and detect\nmanipulation. Importantly, this detection framework is not limited the\nconsidered EV scenario and can be applied to general ADMM algorithms. Finally,\nwe test the proposed decentralised coordination and manipulation detection\nalgorithms in realistic scenarios using real market and driver data from Spain.\nOur empirical results show that the decentralised algorithm's convergence to\nthe optimal solution can be effectively disrupted by manipulative attacks\nachieving convergence to a different non-optimal solution which benefits the\nattacker.

Typical membrane antifouling strategies, such as surface\nhydrophilization, zwitterionic polymer coating, photocatalytic decomposition\nand electrically enhanced antifouling are reviewed, and their cons and pros for\npractical applications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 15:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}
