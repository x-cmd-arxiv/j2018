Prior work offers several\nefficient NUMA-aware locks that exploit this behavior by keeping the lock\nownership on the same socket, thus reducing remote cache misses and\ninter-socket communication. Virtually all those locks, however, are\nhierarchical in their nature, thus requiring space proportional to the number\nof sockets. The increased memory cost renders NUMA-aware locks unsuitable for\nsystems that are conscious to space requirements of their synchronization\nconstructs, with the Linux kernel being the chief example.\n  In this work, we present a compact NUMA-aware lock that requires only one\nword of memory, regardless of the number of sockets in the underlying machine.\nThe new lock is a variant of an efficient (NUMA-oblivious) MCS lock, and\ninherits its performant features, such as local spinning and a single atomic\ninstruction in the acquisition path. Unlike MCS, the new lock organizes waiting\nthreads in two queues, one composed of threads running on the same socket as\nthe current lock holder, and another composed of threads running on a different\nsocket(s).\n  We integrated the new lock in the Linux kernel's qspinlock, one of the major\nsynchronization constructs in the kernel. Our evaluation using both user-space\nand kernel benchmarks shows that the new lock has a single-thread performance\nof MCS, but significantly outperforms the latter under contention, achieving a\nsimilar level of performance when compared to other, state-of-the-art\nNUMA-aware locks that require substantially more space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 16:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 05:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

The harvesting problem becomes finding the optimal\nharvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the expected total income from the\nharvest minus the lost income from the species injections.

We examine the crust cooling evolution of the low-mass X-ray binary MXB\n1659-29 up to ~505 days after the end of its 2015 outburst (hereafter outburst\nII) and compare it with what we observed after its previous 1999 outburst\n(hereafter outburst I) using data obtained from the Swift, XMM-Newton, and\nChandra observatories. The observed effective surface temperature of the\nneutron star in MXB 1659-29 dropped from ~92 eV to ~56 eV from ~12 days to ~505\ndays after the end of outburst II. The most recently performed observation\nafter outburst II suggests that the crust is close to returning to thermal\nequilibrium with the core. We model the crust heating and cooling for both its\noutbursts collectively to understand the effect of parameters that may change\nfor every outburst (e.g., the average accretion rate, the length of outburst,\nthe envelope composition of the neutron star at the end of the outburst) and\nthose which can be assumed to remain the same during these two outbursts (e.g.,\nthe neutron star mass, its radius). Our modelling indicates that all parameters\nwere consistent between the two outbursts with no need for any significant\nchanges. In particular, the strength and the depth of the shallow heating\nmechanism at work (in the crust) were inferred to be the same during both\noutbursts, contrary to what has been found when modelling the cooling curves\nafter multiple outburst of another source, MAXI J0556-332. This difference in\nsource behaviour is not understood. We discuss our results in the context of\nour current understanding of cooling of accretion-heated neutron-star crusts,\nand in particular with respect to the unexplained shallow heating mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 17:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

It has been often stated that\nthe validity (invalidity) of the WF law is the hallmark of an FL\n(non-Fermi-liquid (NFL)). We consider, both in two (2D) and three (3D)\ndimensions, a system of conduction electrons at a finite temperature $T$\ncoupled to a bath of acoustic phonons and quenched impurities, ignoring effects\nof electron-electron interactions. We find that the WF law is violated\narbitrarily strongly with the effective Lorenz number vanishing at low\ntemperatures as long as phonon scattering is stronger than impurity scattering.\nThis happens both in 2D and in 3D for $T<T_{BG}$, where $T_{BG}$ is the\nBloch-Gr\\\"uneisen temperature of the system. In the absence of phonon\nscattering (or equivalently, when impurity scattering is much stronger than the\nphonon scattering), however, the WF law is restored at low temperatures even if\nthe impurity scattering is mostly small angle forward scattering. Thus,\nstrictly at $T=0$ the WF law is always valid in a FL in the presence of\ninfinitesimal impurity scattering. For strong phonon scattering, the WF law is\nrestored for $T> T_{BG}$ (or the Debye temperature $T_D$, whichever is lower)\nas in usual metals. At very high temperatures, thermal smearing of the Fermi\nsurface causes the effective Lorenz number to go below $L_0$ manifesting a\nquantitative deviation from the WF law.

We derive a projected velocity relative to\nthe cluster of $38 \\pm 17 \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1}}$ (1$\\sigma$ confidence\ninterval). Although the error bars are substantial, two independent measures\nsuggest that VFTS682 is a runaway ejected from the central cluster. This\nhypothesis is further supported by a variety of circumstantial clues. The\ncentral cluster is known to harbor other stars more massive than 150 $M_\\odot$\nof similar spectral type and recent astrometric studies on VFTS16 and VFTS72\nprovide direct evidence that the cluster can eject some of its most massive\nmembers, in agreement with theoretical predictions. If future data confirm the\nrunaway nature, this would make VFTS682 the most massive runaway star known to\ndate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

The main improvement is the inclusion of detailed atomic and molecular\nopacities, consistent with the models chemical mixture, that makes the present\nset of models the first to systematically account for variability in C-stars.\nWe examine periods and growth rates in the models, and find that, while the\nfundamental mode is affected by the structure of the envelope, overtones are\nless sensitive to the interior and largely determined by the global properties.\nIn the models, the frequency of the overtone with the largest degree of\nexcitation is found to scale with the acoustic cut-off frequency at the stellar\nsurface, a behaviour similar to that observed for the frequency of maximum\noscillation power for solar-like oscillations in less evolved red giants.

If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (at comparable\nquality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps\nin each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now also explore\nalternative strategies for choosing the initial medoids. We also show how the\nCLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from these modifications. It can easily be\ncombined with earlier approaches to use PAM and CLARA on big data (some of\nwhich use PAM as a subroutine, hence can immediately benefit from these\nimprovements), where the performance with high k becomes increasingly\nimportant.\n  In experiments on real data with k=100, we observed a 200-fold speedup\ncompared to the original PAM SWAP algorithm, making PAM applicable to larger\ndata sets as long as we can afford to compute a distance matrix, and in\nparticular to higher k (at k=2, the new SWAP was only 1.5 times faster, as the\nspeedup is expected to increase with k).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 19:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 14:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 May 2019 22:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

We investigate molecular forces\nbetween diamondoids to explore why molecules with high structural rigidity\nexhibit these novel assembly pathways. The rigid nature of diamondoids\nsignificantly lowers configurational entropy, and we hypothesize that this\ninfluences molecular interaction forces. To test this concept, we calculated\nthe distance-dependent impact of entropy on assembly using molecular dynamics\nsimulations. To isolate pairwise entropic and enthalpic contributions to\nassembly, we considered pairs of molecules in a thermal bath, fixed at set\nintermolecular separations but otherwise allowed to freely move. By comparing\ndiamondoids to linear alkanes, we draw out the impact of rigidity on the\nentropy and enthalpy of pairwise interactions. We find that linear alkanes\nactually exhibit stronger van der Waals interactions than diamondoids at\ncontact, because the bulky structure of diamondoids induces larger net atomic\nseparations. Yet, we also find that diamondoids pay lower entropic penalties\nwhen assembling into contact pairs. Thus, the cage-like shape of diamondoids\nintroduces an enthalpic penalty at contact, but the penalty is counterbalanced\nby entropic effects. Investigating the distance dependence of entropic forces\nprovides a mechanism to explore how rigidity influences molecular assembly. Our\nresults show that low entropic penalties paid by diamondoids can explain the\neffectiveness of diamondoids in templating nanomaterial assembly. Hence, tuning\nmolecular rigidity can be an effective strategy for controlling the assembly of\nfunctional materials, such as biomimetic surfaces and nanoscale materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 19:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 23:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 20:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

To overcome this problem, we propose\na system, called ProPatrol, which leverages the open compartmentalized design\nin families of enterprise applications used in security-sensitive contexts\n(e.g., browser, chat client, email client). To achieve its goal, ProPatrol\ninfers a model for an application's high-level tasks as input-processing\ncompartments using purely the audit log events generated by that application.\nThe main benefit of this approach is that it does not rely on source code or\nbinary instrumentation, but only on a preliminary and general knowledge of an\napplication's architecture to bootstrap the analysis. Our experiments with\nenterprise-level attacks demonstrate that ProPatrol significantly cuts down the\nforensic investigation effort and quickly pinpoints the root- cause of attacks.\nProPatrol incurs less than 2% runtime overhead on a commodity operating system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 20:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

The infrared channels of the instrument operate by combining an\nechelle grating spectrometer with an Acousto-Optical Tunable Filter (AOTF).\nUsing in-flight data, we characterized the instrument performance and\nparameterized its calibration. In particular: an accurate frequency calibration\nwas achieved, together with its variability due to thermal effects on the\ngrating. The AOTF properties and transfer function were also quantified, and we\ndeveloped and tested a realistic method to compute the spectral continuum\ntransmitted through the coupled grating + AOTF system. The calibration results\nenabled unprecedented insights into the important problem of the sensitivity of\nNOMAD to methane abundances in the atmosphere. We also deeply characterized its\nperformance under realistic conditions of varying aerosol abundances, diverse\nalbedos and changing illumination conditions as foreseen over the nominal\nmission. The results show that, in low aerosol conditions, NOMAD single\nspectrum, 1-sigma sensitivity to CH4 is around 0.33 ppbv at 20 km of altitude\nwhen performing solar occultations, and better than 1 ppbv below 30 km. In\ndusty conditions, we show that the sensitivity drops to 0 below 10 km. In Nadir\ngeometry, results demonstrate that NOMAD will be able to produce seasonal maps\nof CH4 with a sensitivity around 5 ppbv over most of planet's surface with\nspatial integration over 5x5 degrees bins. Results show also that such numbers\ncan be improved by a factor of 10 to 30 by data binning. Overall, our results\nquantify NOMAD's capability to address the variable aspects of Martian climate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 20:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

Typically, the goal of\nimage dehazing is to produce clearer images from which human vision can better\nidentify the object and structural details present in the images. When the\nground-truth haze-free image is available for a hazy image, quantitative\nevaluation of image dehazing is usually based on objective metrics, such as\nPeak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM). However, in\nmany applications, large-scale images are collected not for visual examination\nby human. Instead, they are used for many high-level vision tasks, such as\nautomatic classification, recognition and categorization. One fundamental\nproblem here is whether various dehazing methods can produce clearer images\nthat can help improve the performance of the high-level tasks. In this paper,\nwe empirically study this problem in the important task of image classification\nby using both synthetic and real hazy image datasets.

The theory\nsuggests that DNN training comprises a rapid fitting phase followed by a slower\ncompression phase, in which the mutual information $I(X;T)$ between the input\n$X$ and internal representations $T$ decreases. Several papers observe\ncompression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the\ntrue $I(X;T)$ over these networks is provably either constant (discrete $X$) or\ninfinite (continuous $X$). This work explains the discrepancy between theory\nand experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works.\nTo this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which $I(X;T)$\nis a meaningful quantity that depends on the network's parameters. This noisy\nframework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both\nin terms of performance and the learned representations. We then develop a\nrigorous estimator for $I(X;T)$ in noisy DNNs and observe compression in\nvarious models. By relating $I(X;T)$ in the noisy DNN to an\ninformation-theoretic communication problem, we show that compression is driven\nby the progressive clustering of hidden representations of inputs from the same\nclass. Several methods to directly monitor clustering of hidden\nrepresentations, both in noisy and deterministic DNNs, are used to show that\nmeaningful clusters form in the $T$ space. Finally, we return to the estimator\nof $I(X;T)$ employed in past works, and demonstrate that while it fails to\ncapture the true (vacuous) mutual information, it does serve as a measure for\nclustering.

Failure of this analogy at low Reynolds number ($Re$) flow rates has\nfrustrated attempts to create a comprehensive theory.\n  By introducing the concept of self-similar roughness, this investigation\nderives formulas for a plate's skin-friction coefficient and forced convection\ngiven its characteristic length, root-mean-squared (RMS) height-of-roughness,\nisotropic spatial period, and the fluid's Prandtl number ($Pr$). Compared with\nthis novel theory, the RMS relative error (RMSRE) of friction measurements from\nPimenta, Moffat, and Kays (1975) is 4.5%. RMSRE is 3.3% and 4.4% from\nBergstrom, Akinlade, and Tachie (2005) wire meshes and perforated plates. RMSRE\nis 1.7% from this investigation's convection experiments.\n  Building on its analysis of self-similar roughness, this investigation\nderives formulas for a smooth plate's turbulent drag coefficient and forced\nconvection given $Re>0$ and $Pr>0$. Its friction formula matches measurements\nspanning $10^5\\le Re\\le10^9$ by Smith and Walker (1959) and Spalding and Chi\n(1964) with unprecedented 0.75% RMSRE.

In atomic nuclei, exact and dominant\nsymmetries such as rotational invariance, parity, and charge independence have\nbeen clearly established. However, even when these symmetries are taken into\naccount, the structure of nuclei remains illusive and only partially\nunderstood, with no additional symmetries immediately evident from the\nunderlying nucleon-nucleon interaction. Here, we show through ab initio\nlarge-scale nuclear structure calculations that the special nature of the\nstrong nuclear force determines additional highly regular patterns in nuclei\nthat can be tied to an emergent approximate symmetry. We find that this\nsymmetry is remarkably ubiquitous, regardless of its particular strong\ninteraction heritage, and mathematically tracks with a symplectic group.\nSpecifically, we show for light to intermediate-mass nuclei that the structure\nof a nucleus, along with its low-energy excitations, respects symplectic\nsymmetry at about 70-80% level, unveiling the predominance of only a few\nequilibrium shapes, deformed or not, with associated vibrations and rotations.\nThis establishes the symplectic symmetry as a remarkably good symmetry of the\nstrong nuclear force, in the low-energy regime. This may have important\nimplications to studies in astrophysics and neutrino physics that rely on\nnuclear structure information, especially where experimental measurements are\nincomplete or not available. A very important practical advantage is that this\nnew symmetry can be utilized to dramatically reduce computational resources\nrequired in ab initio large-scale nuclear structure modeling. This, in turn,\ncan be used to pioneer predictions, e.g., for short-lived isotopes along\nvarious nucleosynthesis pathways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 23:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

In such a three-versus-three competition,\nseveral measures and models have been used to characterize actual or relative\nrobot strengths.

A more\ngeneral regression model with latent clusters of robot strengths is, thus,\nproposed to enhance their predictive capacities. Two effective estimation\nprocedures are further developed to simultaneously estimate the number of\nclusters, clusters of robots, and robot strengths. Meanwhile, some measures are\nused to assess the predictive ability of competing models, the agreement\nbetween published FRC measures of strength and model-based robot strengths of\nall, playoff, and FRC top-8 robots, and the agreement between FRC top-8 robots\nand model-based top robots. Moreover, the stability of estimated robot\nstrengths and accuracies is investigated to determine whether the scheduled\nmatches are excessive or insufficient. In the analysis of qualification data\nfrom the 2018 FRC Houston and Detroit championships, the predictive ability of\nour model is also shown to be significantly better than those of existing\nmodels.

This mutual dependence, best captured by dynamic game theory, creates\na strong coupling between the vehicle's planning and its predictions of other\ndrivers' behavior, and constitutes an open problem with direct implications on\nthe safety and viability of autonomous driving technology. Unfortunately,\ndynamic games are too computationally demanding to meet the real-time\nconstraints of autonomous driving in its continuous state and action space.

In the network\narchitecture of MSCFF, the symmetric encoder-decoder module, which provides\nboth local and global context by densifying feature maps with trainable\nconvolutional filter banks, is utilized to extract multi-scale and high-level\nspatial features. The feature maps of multiple scales are then up-sampled and\nconcatenated, and a novel multi-scale feature fusion module is designed to fuse\nthe features of different scales for the output. The two output feature maps of\nthe network are cloud and cloud shadow maps, which are in turn fed to binary\nclassifiers outside the model to obtain the final cloud and cloud shadow mask.\nThe MSCFF method was validated on hundreds of globally distributed optical\nsatellite images, with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 50 m, including\nLandsat-5/7/8, Gaofen-1/2/4, Sentinel-2, Ziyuan-3, CBERS-04, Huanjing-1, and\ncollected high-resolution images exported from Google Earth.

An effective fusion method based on relative entropy is introduced\nto combine the complementary features extracted from deep and shallow layers of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN). Moreover, a novel online model update\nstrategy is utilized in our tracker, which enhances the tracking performance\nfurther. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach\noutperforms the most state-of-the-art trackers while tracking at speed of\nexceeded 16 frames per second on challenging benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 06:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

Previous studies have\nconsidered the system of gapped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) possessing spatial\nsymmetries (e.g. inversion) with only termination patterns commensurate with\ninversion- or mirror-symmetric unit cells.

In real-world software testing, the input\nvariables may vary in how strongly they interact, variable strength\ncombinatorial interaction testing (VS-CIT) can exploit this for higher\neffectiveness.

While Nesterov\nacceleration turns gradient descent into an optimal first-order method for\nconvex problems by adding a momentum term with a specific weight sequence, a\ndirect application of this method and weight sequence to ALS results in erratic\nconvergence behaviour. This is so because the tensor decomposition problem is\nnon-convex and ALS is accelerated instead of gradient descent. Instead, we\nconsider various restart mechanisms and suitable choices of momentum weights\nthat enable effective acceleration. Our extensive empirical results show that\nthe Nesterov-accelerated ALS methods with restart can be dramatically more\nefficient than the stand-alone ALS or Nesterov accelerated gradient methods,\nwhen problems are ill-conditioned or accurate solutions are desired. The\nresulting methods perform competitively with or superior to existing\nacceleration methods for ALS, including ALS acceleration by NCG, NGMRES, or\nLBFGS, and additionally enjoy the benefit of being much easier to implement. We\nalso compare with Nesterov-type updates where the momentum weight is determined\nby a line search, which are equivalent or closely related to existing line\nsearch methods for ALS.

In TFM, traction is usually\ncalculated via the solution of a linear system, which is complicated by\nundersampled input data, acquisition noise, and large condition numbers for\nsome methods. Therefore, standard TFM algorithms either employ data filtering\nor regularization.

It enables researchers to build with confidence on the methods and\nfindings of others, reuse and extend computational pipelines, and thereby drive\nscientific progress. Since many experimental studies rely on computational\nanalyses, biologists need guidance on how to set up and document reproducible\ndata analyses or simulations.\n  In this paper, we address several questions about reproducibility. For\nexample, what are the technical and non-technical barriers to reproducible\ncomputational studies? What opportunities and challenges do computational\nnotebooks offer to overcome some of these barriers? What tools are available\nand how can they be used effectively?\n  We have developed a set of rules to serve as a guide to scientists with a\nspecific focus on computational notebook systems, such as Jupyter Notebooks,\nwhich have become a tool of choice for many applications. Notebooks combine\ndetailed workflows with narrative text and visualization of results. Combined\nwith software repositories and open source licensing, notebooks are powerful\ntools for transparent, collaborative, reproducible, and reusable data analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 07:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

This article assesses gender differences in interests within\nthe popular social news and entertainment site Reddit. A method to detect terms\nthat are statistically significantly used more by males or females in 181\nmillion comments in 100 subreddits shows that gender affects both the selection\nof subreddits and activities within most of them. The method avoids the hidden\ngender biases of topic modelling for this task. Although the method reveals\nstatistically significant gender differences in interests for topics that are\nextensively discussed on Reddit, it cannot give definitive causes, and\nimitation and sharing within the site mean that additional checking is needed\nto verify the results. Nevertheless, with care, Reddit can serve as a useful\nsource of insights into gender differences in interests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 07:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

We\nmodel the data and its information content to be found in a single source by a\npartial ordered monoid, and the transfer of information between sources by\ndifferent types of morphisms. To capture the linkage between a family of\nsources, we use a form of Grothendieck construction to create a partial ordered\nmonoid that brings together the global data of the family in a single\nstructure. We apply our approach to database theory and axiomatic structures in\napproximate reasoning. Thus, partial ordered monoids provide a foundation for\nthe algebraic study for information gathering in its most primitive form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 17:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

The key novelty is that we propose to employ\nadversarial training to improve the generalization of a neural network\nprediction model. The rationality of adversarial training here is that the\ninput features to stock prediction are typically based on stock price, which is\nessentially a stochastic variable and continuously changed with time by nature.\nAs such, normal training with static price-based features (e.g. the close\nprice) can easily overfit the data, being insufficient to obtain reliable\nmodels. To address this problem, we propose to add perturbations to simulate\nthe stochasticity of price variable, and train the model to work well under\nsmall yet intentional perturbations. Extensive experiments on two real-world\nstock data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solution with\n3.11% relative improvements on average w.r.t. accuracy, validating the\nusefulness of adversarial training for stock prediction task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 07:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2019 11:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

We then formulate and apply instruction mapping to\ndetermine the possible ways a computation can be performed on a hardware\nsystem. Next, our scheduler chooses a specific mapping and determines the data\nmovement and computation order. In order to manage the large search space of\nmappings and schedules, we developed a flexible framework that allows\nheuristics, cost models, and potentially machine learning to facilitate this\nsearch problem.\n  With this system, we demonstrate the automated extraction of matrix\nmultiplication kernels out of recent deep learning kernels such as\ndepthwise-separable convolution. In addition, we demonstrate two to five times\nbetter performance on DeepBench sized GEMMs and GRU RNN execution when compared\nto state-of-the-art (SOTA) implementations on new hardware and up to 85% of the\nperformance for SOTA implementations on existing hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 23:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

A nanoscale Euler arch made from short\noligomers demonstrates low-frequency, mechanic-like vibrations near the\nbifurcation points, which we associate with an effect similar to thermal\nactivated bistability. All of these effects may be attractive for designing\nmolecular machines and nanodevices with mechanic-like functioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 14:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

In many potential realizations of these networks, these\nlinks will extend over long distances and will span moving platforms, e.g.\nground-to-air or ground-to-satellite. In these cases, the transverse platform\nmotion coupled with spatial variations in atmospheric optical turbulence will\nlead to a breakdown in the time-of-flight reciprocity upon which optical\ntwo-way time-frequency transfer is based. Here, we report experimental\nmeasurements of this effect by use of comb-based optical two-way time-frequency\ntransfer over two spatially separated optical links. We find only a modest\ndegradation in the time synchronization and frequency syntonization between two\nsites, in good agreement with theory. Based on this agreement, we can\nextrapolate this 2-km result to longer distances, finding only a\nfew-femtosecond timing noise increase due to turbulence for a link from ground\nto a mid-earth orbit satellite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 23:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}
