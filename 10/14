We\nconsider grouping wireless powered IoT users into available channels first and\nthen investigate power allocation for users grouped in the same channel to\nimprove the network throughput. Specifically, the user grouping problem is\nformulated as a many to one matching game. It is achieved by considering IoT\nusers and channels as selfish players which belong to two disjoint sets. Both\nselfish players focus on maximizing their own utilities. Then we propose an\nefficient channel allocation algorithm (ECAA) with low complexity for user\ngrouping.

A time series can be modelled as the trajectory of a\nparticle moving in a force field with one degree of freedom. The force acting\non the particle shapes the trajectory of its motion, which is made up of\nelementary shapes of infinitesimal neighborhoods of points in the trajectory.\nIt has been proved that an infinitesimal neighborhood of a point in a\ncontinuous time series can have at least 29 different shapes or configurations.\nSo information can be encoded in it in at least 29 different ways. A 3-point\nneighborhood (the smallest) in a discrete time series can have precisely 13\ndifferent shapes or configurations. In other words, a discrete time series can\nbe expressed as a string of 13 symbols. Across diverse real as well as\nsimulated data sets it has been observed that 6 of them occur more frequently\nand the remaining 7 occur less frequently. Based on frequency distribution of\n13 configurations or 13 different ways of information encoding a novel entropy\nmeasure, called semantic entropy (E), has been defined. Following notion of\npower in Newtonian mechanics of the moving particle whose trajectory is the\ntime series, a notion of information power (P) has been introduced for time\nseries.

The signal carries\ninformation about the thermal state along with density distribution of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR),\nthrough its interaction with charged particles, plays a major role in\ndetermining the kinetic and spin temperature of HI gas in the IGM during dark\nages. A Spatially fluctuating ionization fraction, which is caused by\ninhomogeneous recombinations, causes heat transfer from the CMBR to the IGM gas\ninhomogeneous. We revisit the impact of this inhomogeneous heat transfer on\nspatial fluctuations in the observed HI 21-cm signal over a large redshift\nrange during dark ages. Our study shows that the effect negatively impacts\nfluctuations in the HI spin temperature and results in an enhanced HI 21-cm\npower spectrum.

This\nalteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave\nbackground, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at\nradio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz. Here we report the detection of a\nflattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is\ncentred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at\nhalf-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is\nlargely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by\nearly stars, however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a\nfactor of two greater than the largest predictions. This discrepancy suggests\nthat either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background\nradiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such\nas radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this\ndiscrepancy, of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and\nparticle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between\ndark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude. The\nlow-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had\nproduced a background of Lyman-alpha photons by 180 million years after the Big\nBang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the\nradiation temperature less than 100 million years later.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 18:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

In this model, the assault\non pedestrians, the death of pedestrians and the capture of the guard were\ninvolved simultaneously. An alternative evacuation strategy which can largely\nreduce the number of death was developed and effects of several key parameters\nsuch as the deterrence radius and capture distance on evacuation dynamics were\nstudied. Results show that congestion near the exit has dual effects. More\nspecially, the guard could catch all attackers in a short time because the\nattackers would have more concentrated distribution, but more casualties would\nhappen because pedestrians are hard to escape the attack due to congestion. In\ncontrast, when pedestrians have more preference of approaching the guard,\nalthough the guard would take more time to capture the attackers result from\nthe dispersion of attackers, the death toll would decrease. One of the reason\nis the dispersal of the crowd and the decrease in congestion would be\nbeneficial for escape. Another is the attackers would be killed before\nlaunching the attack to the people those are around the guard, in other words,\nthe guard would protect a large number of pedestrians from being killed.\nMoreover, increasing capture distance of the guard can effectively reduce the\ncasualties and the catch time. As the deterrence radius reflecting the tendency\nof escaping from the guard for attackers rises, it would become more difficult\nfor the guard to catch the attackers and more casualties are caused. However,\nwhen the deterrence radius reaches a certain level, the number of deaths would\nbe reduced because the attackers would prefer to stay as far away as possible\nfrom instead of the position where they could attack more people.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 19:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

A recent work, in collaboration with Army Research Lab, USA\nproposed a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to prevent the\ncyber-alert queue length from growing large and overwhelming the defender.\nGiven the potential deployment of this approach to CSOCs run by US defense\nagencies, we perform a red team (adversarial) evaluation of this approach.\nFurther, with the recent attacks on learning systems, it is even more important\nto test the limits of this RL approach. Towards that end, we learn an\nadversarial alert generation policy that is a best response to the defender\ninspection policy. Surprisingly, we find the defender policy to be quite robust\nto the best response of the attacker. In order to explain this observation, we\nextend the earlier RL model to a game model and show that there exists defender\npolicies that can be robust against any adversarial policy.

However, we go further to exploit assumptions made in the MDP in the\nRL model and discover an attacker policy that overwhelms the defender. We use a\ndouble oracle approach to retrain the defender with episodes from this\ndiscovered attacker policy. This made the defender robust to the discovered\nattacker policy and no further harmful attacker policies were discovered.\nOverall, the adversarial RL and double oracle approach in RL are general\ntechniques that are applicable to other RL usage in adversarial environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 20:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

The aim is to confront\nexperimental results with more precise theoretical determinations, e.g. for the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the CP-violating parameters in the\ndecay of mesons. Quantifying the effects arising from enclosing QED in a finite\nvolume remains a primary target of investigations. To this end, finite-volume\ncorrections to hadron masses in the presence of QED have been carefully studied\nin recent years. This paper extends such studies to the self-energy of moving\ncharged hadrons, both on and away from their mass shell. In particular, we\npresent analytical results for leading finite-volume corrections to the\nself-energy of spin-0 and spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the presence of QED\non a periodic hypercubic lattice, once the spatial zero mode of the photon is\nremoved, a framework that is called $\\mathrm{QED}_{\\mathrm{L}}$.

In this case, we\nexplicitly compute all invariant states of the semigroup.\n  In order to define this class we provide a characterization of when the\nGorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation defines a proper\ngenerator when arbitrary Lindblad operators are allowed (in particular, they do\nnot need to be traceless as demanded by the GKSL Theorem). Moreover, we\nconsider the converse construction to show that every generator naturally gives\nrise to a digraph, and that under certain assumptions the properties of this\ndigraph can be exploited to gain knowledge of both the number and the structure\nof the invariant states of the corresponding semigroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 21:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 19:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

To expedite the diagnosis, we present a novel method named\nVarifocal-Net for simultaneous classification of chromosome's type and polarity\nusing deep convolutional networks.

However, most traditional methods rely on the success of accurate\ncell segmentation and discriminative hand-crafted features extraction. Recently\nthere are emerging deep learning-based methods which train convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) to classify image patches, but they are computationally\nexpensive. In this paper we propose an efficient CNN-based object detection\nmethods for cervical cancer cells/clumps detection. Specifically, we utilize\nthe state-of-the-art two-stage object detection method, the Faster-RCNN with\nFeature Pyramid Network (FPN) as the baseline and propose a novel comparison\ndetector to deal with the limited data problem. The key idea is that classify\nthe proposals by comparing with the reference samples of each category in\nobject detection. In addition, we propose to learn the reference samples of the\nbackground from data instead of manually choosing them by some heuristic rules.\nExperimental results show that the proposed Comparison Detector yields\nsignificant improvement on the small dataset, achieving a mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) of 26.3% and an Average Recall (AR) of 35.7%, both improving\nabout 20 points compared to the baseline. Moreover, Comparison Detector\nimproved AR by 4.6 points and achieved marginally better performance in terms\nof mAP compared with baseline model when training on the medium dataset.

The multiscale nature of the\nparticle method mainly comes from the recovery of the time evolution flux\nfunction in the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) through a coupled dynamic\nprocess of particle transport and collision. This practice improves the\noriginal operator splitting approach in the Monte Carlo method, such as the\nseparated treatment of particle transport and collision. As a result, with the\nvariation of the ratio between numerical time step and local photon's collision\ntime, different transport physics can be fully captured in a single\ncomputation. In the diffusive limit, the UGKP method could recover the solution\nof the diffusion equation with the cell size and time step being much larger\nthan the photon's mean free path and the mean collision time. In the free\ntransport limit, it presents an exact particle tracking process as the original\nMonte Carlo method. In the transition regime, the weights of particle free\ntransport and collision are determined by the ratio of local numerical time\nstep to the photon's collision time. Several one-dimensional numerical examples\ncovering all transport regimes from the optically thin to optically thick are\ncomputed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the current scheme.

The interparticle interaction gives rise to two principal effects: (i)\n- enhancement of the external field amplitude and (ii) - renormalization of the\nquantum dot's resonance frequencies and relaxation rates of the off-diagonal\ndensity matrix elements, both depending on the populations of the quantum dot's\nlevels. Here, we focus on the first effect, which results in interesting new\nfeatures, in particular, in an increased number of Rabi cycles per pulse as\ncompared to an isolated quantum dot and subsequent growth of the number of\nentangled photon pairs per pulse. We also discuss the destructive role of\nradiative decay of the excitonic states on two-photon Rabi oscillations for\nboth an isolated quantum dot and a heterodimer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 12:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

We use Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) to select important\nrelations in multi-hop paths and encode them into low-dimensional vectors. By\ntreating relations and multi-hop paths as two different input sources, we use a\nfeature extractor, which is shared by two downstream components (i.e. relation\nclassifier and source discriminator), to capture shared/similar information\nbetween them. By joint adversarial training, we encourage our model to extract\nfeatures from the multi-hop paths which are representative for relation\ncompletion. We apply the trained model (except for the source discriminator) to\nseveral large-scale KBs for relation completion.

In this\npaper, we identify dust substructures in 12 disks and measure their properties\nto investigate how they form. This subsample of disks is selected from a\nhigh-resolution ($\\sim0.12''$) ALMA 1.33 mm survey of 32 disks in the Taurus\nstar-forming region, which was designed to cover a wide range of sub-mm\nbrightness and to be unbiased to previously known substructures. While\naxisymmetric rings and gaps are common within our sample, spiral patterns and\nhigh contrast azimuthal asymmetries are not detected. Fits of disk models to\nthe visibilities lead to estimates of the location and shape of gaps and rings,\nthe flux in each disk component, and the size of the disk. The dust\nsubstructures occur across a wide range of stellar mass and disk brightness.\nDisks with multiple rings tend to be more massive and more extended. The\ncorrelation between gap locations and widths, the intensity contrast between\nrings and gaps, and the separations of rings and gaps could all be explained if\nmost gaps are opened by low-mass planets (super-Earths and Neptunes) in the\ncondition of low disk turbulence ($\\alpha=10^{-4}$). The gap locations are not\nwell correlated with the expected locations of CO and N$_2$ ice lines, so\ncondensation fronts are unlikely to be a universal mechanism to create gaps and\nrings, though they may play a role in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 15:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

However, such hands pose a major challenge for autonomous\ncontrol, due to the high dimensionality of their configuration space and\ncomplex intermittent contact interactions. In this work, we propose deep\nreinforcement learning (deep RL) as a scalable solution for learning complex,\ncontact rich behaviors with multi-fingered hands. Deep RL provides an\nend-to-end approach to directly map sensor readings to actions, without the\nneed for task specific models or policy classes. We show that contact-rich\nmanipulation behavior with multi-fingered hands can be learned by directly\ntraining with model-free deep RL algorithms in the real world, with minimal\nadditional assumption and without the aid of simulation. We learn a variety of\ncomplex behaviors on two different low-cost hardware platforms. We show that\neach task can be learned entirely from scratch, and further study how the\nlearning process can be further accelerated by using a small number of human\ndemonstrations to bootstrap learning. Our experiments demonstrate that complex\nmulti-fingered manipulation skills can be learned in the real world in about\n4-7 hours for most tasks, and that demonstrations can decrease this to 2-3\nhours, indicating that direct deep RL training in the real world is a viable\nand practical alternative to simulation and model-based control.\n\\url{https://sites.google.com/view/deeprl-handmanipulation}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 15:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

In this\npaper, we propose an Incremental active semi-supervised learning (IASSL)\ntechnology for unseen object detection. It combines batch-based active learning\n(AL) and bin-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage the strong points\nof AL's exploration and SSL's exploitation capabilities. A collaborative\nsampling method is also adopted to measure the uncertainty and diversity of AL\nand the confidence in SSL. Batch-based AL allows us to select more informative,\nconfident, and representative samples with low cost. Bin-based SSL divides\nstreaming image samples into several bins, and each bin repeatedly transfers\nthe discriminative knowledge of convolutional neural network (CNN) deep\nlearning to the next bin until the performance criterion is reached. IASSL can\novercome noisy and biased labels in unknown, cluttered data distributions. We\nobtain superior performance, compared to state-of-the-art technologies such as\nFaster RCNN, SSD300, and YOLOv2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 17:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Nonetheless, it can\nperform surprisingly well at the general task of differentiating classes of\ntime-ordered behavior sequences which are sensed by more than one modality. As\na demonstration of our capabilities in the audio to video context, we focus on\nthe differentiation of speech sequences.\n  Data from two or more modalities first are represented using self-similarity\nmatrices(SSMs) corresponding to time-ordered point clouds in feature spaces of\neach of these data sources; we note that these feature spaces can be of\nentirely different scale and dimensionality.\n  A fused similarity template is then derived from the modality-specific SSMs\nusing a technique called similarity network fusion (SNF). We investigate\npipelines using SNF as both an upstream (feature-level) and a downstream\n(ranking-level) fusion technique. Multiscale geometric features of this\ntemplate are then extracted using a recently-developed technique called the\nscattering transform, and these features are then used to differentiate speech\nsequences. This method outperforms unsupervised techniques which operate\ndirectly on the raw data, and it also outperforms stovepiped methods which\noperate on SSMs separately derived from the distinct modalities. The benefits\nof this method become even more apparent as the simulated peak signal to noise\nratio decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2018 18:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 01:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

In this work, we propose and demonstrate\na novel meta-surfaced waveguide structure on silicon, which enables\nultral-sharp multimode waveguide bends to have low loss and low crosstalk among\ndifferent mode-channels.An ultra-sharp S-bend with a bending radius of\nR=10{\\mu}m is realized for an MDM optical interconnect with three\nmode-channels. The numerical simulation shows that the proposed ultal-sharp\nmeta-surfaced multimode waveguide bend (MMWB) has low excess losses (0.2~0.5dB)\nand low inter-mode crosstalk (<-30dB) over a broad wavelength-band(>100nm) for\nall the three mode-channels. This is verified by experimental results, which\nshow that the fabricated S-bends have excess losses of 0.5~0.8dB and inter-mode\ncrosstalk of <-20 dB over a wavelength of >60 nm. The experimental results were\npartially limited by the measurement setup, particularly the on-chip mode\n(de)multiplexers which had inter-mode crosstalk of about -20dB. The proposed\nMMWB can be extended for the transmission of more than three mode-channels.Our\nwork paves the way to use meta-surfaced silicon photonic waveguide structures\nfor on-chip multimode optical interconnect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 07:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}
