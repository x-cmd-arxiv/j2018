Contrary\nto traditional classification methods that rely on hand-crafted or engineered\nfeatures, convolution neural network (CNN) can classify cervical cells based on\nautomatically learned deep features. However, CNN in previous studies do not\ninvolve cell morphological information, and it is unknown whether morphological\nfeatures can be directly modeled by CNN to classify cervical cells. This paper\npresents a CNN-based method that combines cell image appearance with cell\nmorphology for classification of cervical cells in Pap smear. The training\ncervical cell dataset consists of adaptively re-sampled image patches coarsely\ncentered on the nuclei. Several CNN models (AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet and\nDenseNet) pre-trained on ImageNet dataset were fine-tuned on the cervical\ndataset for comparison. The proposed method is evaluated on the Herlev cervical\ndataset by five-fold cross-validation at patient level splitting. Results show\nthat by adding cytoplasm and nucleus masks as raw morphological information\ninto appearance-based CNN learning, higher classification accuracies can be\nachieved in general. Among the four CNN models, GoogleNet fed with both\nmorphological and appearance information obtains the highest classification\naccuracies of 94.5% for 2-class classification task and 64.5% for 7-class\nclassification task. Our method demonstrates that combining cervical cell\nmorphology with appearance information can provide improved classification\nperformance, which is clinically important for early diagnosis of cervical\ndysplastic changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 16:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

This approach allows us to systematically account for the effects of\nboundary deformations on the linearized evolution of the vortex ring. We\ninvestigate the instantaneous amplification of perturbations assumed to have\nthe same the circulation as the vortex rings in their equilibrium\nconfiguration. These stability properties are then determined by the spectrum\nof a singular integro-differential operator defined on the vortex boundary in\nthe meridional plane. The resulting generalized eigenvalue problem is solved\nnumerically with a spectrally-accurate discretization. Our results reveal that\nwhile thin vortex rings remain neutrally stable to axisymmetric perturbations,\nthey become linearly unstable to such perturbations when they are sufficiently\n``fat''. Analysis of the structure of the eigenmodes demonstrates that they\napproach the corresponding eigenmodes of Rankine's vortex and Hill's vortex in\nthe thin-vortex and fat-vortex limit, respectively. This study is a stepping\nstone on the way towards a complete stability analysis of inviscid vortex rings\nwith respect to general perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 17:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 05:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

As the number of link flows is typically much less than that\nof OD flows, the inverse problem is severely ill-posed and hence prior\ninformation is required to recover the ground truth. The basic approach in the\nliterature relies on a forward model where the so called traffic assignment\nmatrix maps OD flows to link flows. Due to the ill-posedness of the problem,\nprior information on the assignment matrix and OD flows are typically needed.\n  The main contributions of this paper include a dimension reduction of the\ninquired flows from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and a demonstration that for the first\ntime the ground truth OD flows can be uniquely identified with no or little\nprior information. To cope with the ill-posedness due to the large number of\nunknowns, a new forward model is developed which does not involve OD flows\ndirectly but is built upon the flows characterized only by their origins,\nhenceforth referred as O-flows. The new model preserves all the OD information\nand more importantly reduces the dimension of the inverse problem\nsubstantially. A Gauss-Seidel method is deployed to solve the inverse problem,\nand a necessary condition for the uniqueness of the solution is proved.\nSimulations demonstrate that blind estimation where no prior information is\navailable is possible for some network settings. Some challenging network\nsettings are identified and discussed, where a remedy based on temporal\npatterns of the O-flows is developed and numerically shown effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 18:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

The function\nprovider is only billed for the actual computational resources used by the\nfunction invocation. Compared to previous cloud paradigms, FaaS requires\nsignificantly more fine-grained resource measurement mechanisms, e.g. to\nmeasure compute time and memory usage of a single function invocation with\nsub-second accuracy. Thanks to the short duration and stateless nature of\nfunctions, and the availability of multiple open-source frameworks, FaaS\nenables non-traditional service providers e.g. individuals or data centers with\nspare capacity.

Current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods\ntreat the two tasks independently. One typical assumption of the existing depth\nestimation methods is that the scenes contain no independent moving objects.\nwhile object moving could be easily modeled using optical flow. In this paper,\nwe propose to address the two tasks as a whole, i.e. to jointly understand\nper-pixel 3D geometry and motion. This eliminates the need of static scene\nassumption and enforces the inherent geometrical consistency during the\nlearning process, yielding significantly improved results for both tasks. We\ncall our method as \"Every Pixel Counts++\" or \"EPC++\". Specifically, during\ntraining, given two consecutive frames from a video, we adopt three parallel\nnetworks to predict the camera motion (MotionNet), dense depth map (DepthNet),\nand per-pixel optical flow between two frames (OptFlowNet) respectively. The\nthree types of information are fed into a holistic 3D motion parser (HMP), and\nper-pixel 3D motion of both rigid background and moving objects are\ndisentangled and recovered.

This self-attraction acts as\na dielectric trap that can enhance the translocation time by orders of\nmagnitude.

To meet\nthe high-rate data transmission requirements on HSTs, millimeter wave (mmWave)\nHST communications have drawn increasingly attentions. To realize sufficient\nlink margin, mmWave HST systems employ directional beamforming with large\nantenna arrays, which results in that the channel estimation is rather\ntime-consuming. In HST scenarios, channel conditions vary quickly and channel\nestimations should be performed frequently. Since the period of each\ntransmission time interval (TTI) is too short to allocate enough time for\naccurate channel estimation, the key challenge is how to design an efficient\nbeam searching scheme to leave more time for data transmission. Motivated by\nthe successful applications of machine learning, this paper tries to exploit\nthe similarities between current and historical wireless propagation\nenvironments. Using the knowledge of reinforcement learning, the beam searching\nproblem of mmWave HST communications is formulated as a multi-armed bandit\n(MAB) problem and a bandit inspired beam searching scheme is proposed to reduce\nthe number of measurements as many as possible. Unlike the popular deep\nlearning methods, the proposed scheme does not need to collect and store a\nmassive amount of training data in advance, which can save a huge amount of\nresources such as storage space, computing time, and power energy. Moreover,\nthe performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of regret. The\nregret analysis indicates that the proposed schemes can approach the\ntheoretical limit very quickly, which is further verified by simulation\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 02:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

In this paper, we\ndevelop a distributed observer that operates on a single time-scale, is of the\nsame dimension as that of the state, and works under mild assumptions of joint\nobservability of the sensing model, and joint strong-connectivity of the\nsequence of communication graphs. Our approach is based on the notion of a\nnovel \"freshness-index\" that keeps track of the age-of-information being\ndiffused across the network.

Our proposal offers a reliable and feasible scenario for manipulating\nthe Cooper pairs in cold atoms, serving as a tunable as well as powerful\nplatform for quantum-emulating and exploring the FF superfluid phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 02:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

As the waves carry off orbital energy, the two bodies spiral into\neach other and eventually merge. They are described by Einstein's equations of\nGeneral Relativity. For the early phase of the orbit, called the inspiral,\nEinstein equations can be linearized and solved through analytical\napproximations, while for the late phase, near the merger, we need to solve the\nfully nonlinear Einstein's equations on supercomputers. In order to recover the\ngravitational wave for the entire evolution of the binary, a match is required\nbetween the inspiral and the merger waveforms. Our objectives are to establish\na streamlined matching method, that will allow an analytical calculation of the\ncomplete gravitational waveform, while developing a gravitational wave modeling\ntutorial for undergraduate physics students. We use post-Newtonian (PN) theory\nfor the inspiral phase, which offers an excellent training ground for students,\nand rely on Mathematica for our calculations, a tool easily accessible to\nundergraduates. For the merger phase we bypass Einstein's equations by using a\nsimple analytic toy model named the Implicit Rotating Source (IRS).

In this paper, a fast algorithm for heart rate estimation based on\nmodified SPEctral subtraction scheme utilizing Composite Motion Artifacts\nReference generation (SPECMAR) is proposed using two-channel PPG and three-axis\naccelerometer signals. First, the preliminary noise reduction is obtained by\nfiltering unwanted frequency components from the recorded signals. Next, a\ncomposite motion artifacts reference generation method is developed to be\nemployed in the proposed SPECMAR algorithm for motion artifacts reduction. The\nheart rate is then computed from the noise and motion artifacts reduced PPG\nsignal. Finally, a heart rate tracking algorithm is proposed considering\nneighboring estimates.

Through an asteroseismic study we\ninvestigate if the stars have similar properties, which could be an indication\nthat they are physically bound into a binary system.

Additionally, we found that the encapsulation of the GaSe\nphotodetectors with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can protect the GaSe from\ndegradation and can help to achieve long-term stability of the devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 08:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

The overall computational complexity of the robust TCUC methods is\nclosely related to the vertex number of the uncertainty set. The vertex number\nis further associated with 1) the period number in the scheduling horizon as\nwell as 2) the number of nodes with uncertain injections. In this paper, a\ncolumn merging method (CMM) is proposed to reduce the computation burden by\nmerging the uncertain nodes, while still guar-anteeing the robustness of the\nsolution. By the CMM, the transmission constraints are modified, with the\nparameters obtained based on an analytical solution of a uniform approximation\nproblem, so that the computational time is negligi-ble. The CMM is applied\nunder a greedy-algorithm based framework, where the number of merged nodes and\nthe ap-proximation error can be well balanced. The CMM is designed as a\npreprocessing tool to improve the solution efficiency for robust TCUC problems\nand is compatible with many solution methods (like two-stage and multi-stage\nrobust optimi-zation methods).

In literature, autoencoders have shown to perform well on a\nvariety of tasks spread across multiple domains, thereby establishing\nwidespread applicability. Typically, an autoencoder is trained to generate a\nmodel that minimizes the reconstruction error between the input and the\nreconstructed output, computed in terms of the Euclidean distance. While this\ncan be useful for applications related to unsupervised reconstruction, it may\nnot be optimal for classification. In this paper, we propose a novel Supervised\nCOSMOS Autoencoder which utilizes a multi-objective loss function to learn\nrepresentations that simultaneously encode the (i) \"similarity\" between the\ninput and reconstructed vectors in terms of their direction, (ii)\n\"distribution\" of pixel values of the reconstruction with respect to the input\nsample, while also incorporating (iii) \"discriminability\" in the feature\nlearning pipeline. The proposed autoencoder model incorporates a Cosine\nsimilarity and Mahalanobis distance based loss function, along with supervision\nvia Mutual Information based loss. Detailed analysis of each component of the\nproposed model motivates its applicability for feature learning in different\nclassification tasks. The efficacy of Supervised COSMOS autoencoder is\ndemonstrated via extensive experimental evaluations on different image\ndatasets. The proposed model outperforms existing algorithms on MNIST,\nCIFAR-10, and SVHN databases.

At the same time, the future cellular\nnetworks will have to fulfill stringent latency constraints. To that end, one\nproblem that is posed as a potential showstopper is extreme congestion for\nrequesting uplink scheduling over the physical random access channel (PRACH).\nIndeed, such congestion drags along scheduling delay problems. In this paper,\nthe use of self-organized device-to-device (D2D) clustering is advocated for\nmitigating PRACH congestion. To this end, the paper proposes two D2D clustering\nschemes, namely; Random-Based Clustering (RBC) and Channel-Gain-Based\nClustering (CGBC). Accordingly, this paper sheds light on random access within\nthe proposed D2D clustering schemes and presents a case study based on a\nstochastic geometry framework. For the sake of objective evaluation, the D2D\nclustering is benchmarked by the conventional scheduling request procedure.\nAccordingly, the paper offers insights into useful scenarios that minimize the\nscheduling delay for each clustering scheme. Finally, the paper discusses the\nimplementation algorithm and some potential implementation issues and remedies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 09:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

The edge states are hosted by a magnetic energy gap at\nthe Dirac point but all attempts to observe it directly have been unsuccessful.\nThe gap size is considered crucial to overcoming the present limitations of the\nQAHE, which so far occurs only at temperatures one to two orders of magnitude\nbelow its principle limit set by the ferromagnetic Curie temperature $T_C$.\nHere, we use low temperature photoelectron spectroscopy to unambiguously reveal\nthe magnetic gap of Mn-doped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ films, which is present only below\n$T_C$. Surprisingly, the gap turns out to be $\\sim$90 meV wide, which not only\nexceeds $k_BT$ at room temperature but is also 5 times larger than predicted by\ndensity functional theory. By an exhaustive multiscale structure\ncharacterization we show that this enhancement is due to a remarkable structure\nmodification induced by Mn doping. Instead of a disordered impurity system, it\nforms an alternating sequence of septuple and quintuple layer blocks, where Mn\nis predominantly incorporated in the septuple layers.

Mn-doped\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ forms a similar heterostructure, however, only a large,\nnonmagnetic gap is formed. We explain both differences based on the higher\nspin-orbit interaction in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with the most important consequence of a\nmagnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the films, whereas for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the\nspin-orbit interaction it is too weak to overcome the dipole-dipole\ninteraction.

The required computational cost is likely to get worse due to the\nplanned large area sky surveys with telescopes like the Low Frequency Array\n(LOFAR), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and eventually the Square\nKilometre Array (SKA). The massively parallel General Purpose Graphical\nProcessing Units (GPGPUs) can be used to execute some of the computationally\nintensive astronomical image processing algorithms including RM synthesis. In\nthis paper, we present a GPU-accelerated code, called cuFFS or CUDA-accelerated\nFast Faraday Synthesis, to perform Faraday rotation measure synthesis. Compared\nto a fast single-threaded and vectorized CPU implementation, depending on the\nstructure and format of the data cubes, our code achieves an increase in speed\nof up to two orders of magnitude. During testing, we noticed that the disk I/O\nwhen using the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) data format is a major\nbottleneck and to reduce the time spent on disk I/O, our code supports the\nfaster HDFITS format in addition to the standard FITS format. The code is\nwritten in C with GPU-acceleration achieved using Nvidia's CUDA parallel\ncomputing platform.

Then, to eliminate the\nredundancy involved in the full-order observer, a class of reduced-order\nobserver-based control protocols is designed. Algorithms to construct both\nprotocols are presented, which guarantee that agents can reach consensus in the\nasymptotic mean square sense when they are not perturbed by disturbances, and\nthat they have decent $H_{\\infty}$ performance and transient performance when\nthe disturbances exist.

This shows a\nquadratic separation between matroid center and $k$-center, for which the\nDoubling algorithm gives an $8$-approximation using $O(k)$-space and one pass.\nTo complement this, we give a one-pass algorithm for matroid center that stores\nat most $O(r^2\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/\\varepsilon)$ points (viz., stream summary)\namong which a $(7+\\varepsilon)$-approximate solution exists, which can be found\nby brute force, or a $(17+\\varepsilon)$-approximation can be found with an\nefficient algorithm. If we are allowed a second pass, we can compute a\n$(3+\\varepsilon)$-approximation efficiently; this also achieves almost the\nknown-best approximation ratio (of $3+\\varepsilon$) with total running time of\n$O((nr + r^{3.5})\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/\\varepsilon + r^2(\\log\n\\Delta)/\\varepsilon)$, where $n$ is the number of input points.\n  We also consider the problem of matroid center with $z$ outliers and give a\none-pass algorithm that outputs a set of\n$O((r^2+rz)\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/\\varepsilon)$ points that contains a\n$(15+\\varepsilon)$-approximate solution. Our techniques extend to knapsack\ncenter and knapsack center with outliers in a straightforward way, and we get\nalgorithms that use space linear in the size of a largest feasible set (as\nopposed to quadratic space for matroid center).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 10:53:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 10:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

In this paper, a novel approach to correct jet\nmomenta (or energies) for the underlying background in heavy-ion collisions is\nintroduced. The proposed method makes use of common Machine Learning techniques\nto estimate the jet transverse momentum based on several parameters, including\nproperties of the jet constituents.

We focus on a Bierens (1990)-type conditional moment test of\nomitted nonlinearity for convenience, and because of difficulties that have\nbeen ignored to date. Existing methods include the supremum p-value which\npromotes a conservative test that is generally not consistent, and test\nstatistic transforms like the supremum and average for which bootstrap methods\nare not valid under weak identification. We propose a new wild bootstrap method\nfor p-value computation by targeting specific identification cases. We then\ncombine bootstrapped p-values across polar identification cases to form an\nasymptotically valid p-value approximation that is robust to any identification\ncase. The wild bootstrap does not require knowledge of the covariance structure\nof the bootstrapped processes, whereas Andrews and Cheng's (2012, 2013, 2014)\nsimulation approach generally does. Our method allows for robust bootstrap\ncritical value computation as well. Our bootstrap method (like conventional\nones) does not lead to a consistent p-value approximation for test statistic\nfunctions like the supremum and average. We therefore smooth over the robust\nbootstrapped p-value as the basis for several tests which achieve the correct\nasymptotic level, and are consistent, for any degree of identification. They\nalso achieve uniform size control. A simulation study reveals possibly large\nempirical size distortions in non-robust tests when weak or non-identification\narises. One of our smoothed p-value tests, however, dominates all other tests\nby delivering accurate empirical size and comparatively high power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 13:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 16:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 18:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

In this situation, new insights into the burst mechanism could be gained\nby combining the temporal behavior of radio pulsations. We present a general\nmodel for radio suppression by relativistic $e^{\\pm}$ plasma outflows at the\nonset of magnetar flares. A sudden ejection of magnetic energy into the\nmagnetosphere would generate a fireball plasma, which is promptly driven to\nexpand at relativistic speed.

We focus on the binary\ncase and use an Ising model to characterize interactions between the ensemble\nand the underlying true classifier. The presence of an edge between an observed\nclassifier and the true classifier indicates a direct dependence whereas the\nabsence indicates the corresponding one provides no additional information and\nshall be eliminated. This observation leads to the pruning step where the key\nis to recover the neighborhood of the true classifier.

Exerting control over the structure and\nproperties of PVD glasses formed with different types of glass-forming\nmolecules is now an emerging challenge. In this work, we study coarse grained\nmodels of organic glass formers containing fluorocarbon tails of increasing\nlength, corresponding to an increased tendency to form microstructures. We use\nsimulated PVD to examine how the presence of the microphase separated domains\nin the supercooled liquid influences the ability to form stable glasses. This\nmodel suggests that increasing molecule tail length results in decreased\nthermodynamic and kinetic stability of the molecules in PVD films. The reduced\nstability is further linked to the reduced ability of these molecules to\nequilibrate at the free surface during PVD. We find that as the tail length is\nincreased, the relaxation time near the surface of the supercooled equilibrium\nliquid films of these molecules are slowed and become essentially bulk-like,\ndue to the segregation of the fluorocarbon tails to the free surface. Surface\ndiffusion is also markedly reduced due to clustering of the molecules at the\nsurface.

The understanding of these systems\nrequires a solid description of the three-body (core+N+N) continuum. The\nidentification of a state with resonant character from the background of\nnon-resonant continuum states in the same energy range poses a theoretical\nchallenge. It is the purpose of this work to establish a robust theoretical\nframework to identify and characterize three-body resonances in a discrete\nbasis. A resonance operator is proposed, which describes the sensitivity to\nchanges in the potential. Resonances are then identified from the lowest\neigenstates of the resonance operator. The operator is diagonalized in a basis\nof Hamiltonian pseudostates, built within the hyperspherical harmonics\nformalism using the analytical THO basis. The energy and width of the resonance\nare determined from its time dependence. The method is applied to 16Be in a\n14Be+n+n model. An effective core+n potential, fitted to the available\ninformation on the subsystem 15Be, is employed. The 0+ ground state resonance\nof 16Be presents a strong dineutron configuration, which favors the picture of\na correlated two-neutron emission. Fitting the three body interaction to the\nexperimental two-neutron separation energy |S2n|=1.35(10) MeV, the computed\nwidth is Gamma(0+)=0.16 MeV. From the same Hamiltonian, a 2+ resonance is also\npredicted with E_r(2+)=2.42 MeV and Gamma(2+)=0.40 MeV. The dineutron\nconfiguration and the computed 0+ width are consistent with previous R-matrix\ncalculations for the true three-body continuum. The extracted values of the\nresonance energy and width converge with the size of the pseudostate basis and\nare robust under changes in the basis parameters. This supports the reliability\nof the method in describing the properties of unbound core+N+N systems in a\ndiscrete basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 08:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Single image super resolution (SISR) is an effective\nand cost efficient alternative technique to improve the spatial resolution of\nMR images. In the past few years, SISR methods based on deep learning\ntechniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance on natural images. However, the information is\ngradually weakened and training becomes increasingly difficult as the network\ndeepens. The problem is more serious for medical images because lacking high\nquality and effective training samples makes deep models prone to underfitting\nor overfitting. Nevertheless, many current models treat the hierarchical\nfeatures on different channels equivalently, which is not helpful for the\nmodels to deal with the hierarchical features discriminatively and targetedly.\nTo this end, we present a novel channel splitting network (CSN) to ease the\nrepresentational burden of deep models. The proposed CSN model divides the\nhierarchical features into two branches, i.e., residual branch and dense\nbranch, with different information transmissions. The residual branch is able\nto promote feature reuse, while the dense branch is beneficial to the\nexploration of new features. Besides, we also adopt the merge-and-run mapping\nto facilitate information integration between different branches. Extensive\nexperiments on various MR images, including proton density (PD), T1 and T2\nimages, show that the proposed CSN model achieves superior performance over\nother state-of-the-art SISR methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:15:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 14:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 05:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

I review how strong\ngravitational lensing can be used to elucidate the structures of these sources\nfrom radio frequencies up to very high energy gamma rays. The deep\ngravitational potentials surrounding galaxies act as natural gravitational\nlenses. These gravitational lenses split background sources into multiple\nimages, each with a gravitationally-induced time delay. These time delays and\npositions of lensed images depend on the source location, and thus, can be used\nto infer the spatial origins of the emission. For example, using\ngravitationally-induced time delays improves angular resolution of modern\ngamma-ray instruments by six orders of magnitude, and provides evidence that\ngamma-ray outbursts can be produced at even thousands of light years from a\nsupermassive black hole, and that the compact radio emission does not always\ntrace the position of the supermassive black hole. These findings provide\nunique physical information about the central structure of active galaxies,\nforce us to revise our models of operating particle acceleration mechanisms,\nand challenge our assumptions about the origin of compact radio emission.\nFuture surveys, including LSST, SKA, and Euclid, will provide observations for\nhundreds of thousands of gravitationally lensed sources, which will allow us to\napply strong gravitational lensing to study the multi-wavelength structure for\nlarge ensembles of sources.

The axion star as coherent state of\naxions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with\nfrequency $m_a/2\\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons\ncoherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The\nradiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb\nthe coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the\ntime scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra\nof the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally\nbroaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\\delta\\nu$ are proportional\nto their center frequencies $\\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies\n( $1.2$GHz$\\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler\nshifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On\nthe other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center\nfrequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift\nalso makes the durations of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter.\nBecause the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed to be stronger\nthan those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating\nFRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields\nof the neutron stars also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs,\nwhich are over the extent of the receiver frequency range.

Existing\ncentralized solutions suffer from isolated data storage and lacking trust when\nmultiple parties are involved. Decentralized blockchain-based approaches\nattempt to overcome these shortcomings by creating digital representations of\nphysical goods to facilitate tracking across multiple entities. However, they\ncurrently do not capture the transformation of goods in manufacturing\nprocesses. Therefore, the relation between ingredients and product is lost,\nlimiting the ability to trace a product's provenance. We propose a\nblockchain-based supply chain traceability system using smart contracts. In\nsuch contracts, manufacturers define the composition of products in the form of\nrecipes. Each ingredient of the recipe is a non-fungible token that corresponds\nto a batch of physical goods. When the recipe is applied, its ingredients are\nconsumed and a new token is produced. This mechanism preserves the traceability\nof product transformations. The system is implemented for the Ethereum Virtual\nMachine and is applicable to any blockchain configuration that supports it.

Our result demonstrates the\ngreat potential of the real time $in-situ$ optical spectroscopy for the\nrealization of the precisely controlled growth of 2D semiconductor materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

Social context is one of the most important sources of information in\nhuman-activity based applications. In this paper, we mainly focus on social\nrelational context that represents the interpersonal relationship between\nindividuals, and the role or influence of such context on users' diverse phone\ncall activities in their real world life. Individuals different phone call\nactivities such as making a phone call to a particular person or responding an\nincoming call may differ from person-to-person based on their interpersonal\nrelationships such as family, friend, or colleague. However, it is very\ndifficult to make the device understandable about such semantic relationships\nbetween individuals and the relevant context-aware applications. To address\nthis issue, in this paper, we explore the data-centric social relational\ncontext that can play a significant role in building context-aware personalized\nmobile applications for various purposes in our real world life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 14:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}
