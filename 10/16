The solution\ndescribes the most general configuration that an astrophysical black hole must\nhave. The black hole rotates about the $z$-axis with angular momentum\nproportional to $m \\omega$ and the geometry has just one Killing vector\n$\\partial/\\partial{u}$, where $u$ is the retarded time coordinate. The boost\nturns the ergosphere asymmetric, with dominant lobes in the direction opposite\nto the boost. The event and Cauchy horizons, defined for the case $\\omega < m$,\nare specified respectively by the radii $r_{\\pm}=m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2-\\omega^2}$.\nThe horizons are topologically spherical and the singularity has the topology\nof a circle on planes that are orthogonal to the boost direction.

Measurements are carried out on one QFT, the \"system\", using\nanother, the \"probe\" via a dynamical coupling of \"system\" and \"probe\" in a\nbounded spacetime region. The resulting \"coupled theory\" determines a\nscattering map on the uncoupled combination of the \"system\" and \"probe\" by\nreference to natural \"in\" and \"out\" spacetime regions. No specific interaction\nis assumed and all constructions are local and covariant.\n  Given any initial probe state in the \"in\" region, the scattering map\ndetermines a completely positive map from \"probe\" observables in the \"out\"\nregion to \"induced system observables\", thus providing a measurement scheme for\nthe latter. It is shown that the induced system observables may be localized in\nthe causal hull of the interaction coupling region and are typically less sharp\nthan the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the\ncoupled theory. Post-selected states conditioned on measurement outcomes are\nobtained using Davies-Lewis instruments. Composite measurements involving\ncausally ordered coupling regions are also considered. Provided that the\nscattering map obeys a causal factorization property, the causally ordered\ncomposition of the individual instruments coincides with the composite\ninstrument; in particular, the instruments may be combined in either order if\nthe coupling regions are causally disjoint.

Using the Enzo code and a new refinement scheme, FOGGIE\nreaches spatial resolutions of 381 comoving $h^{-1}$ pc and resolves extremely\nlow masses ($\\lesssim 1$--$100$ Msun out to 100 comoving $h^{-1}$ kpc from the\ncentral halo. At these resolutions, cloud and filament-like structures giving\nrise to simulated absorption are smaller, and better resolved, than the same\nstructures simulated with standard density-dependent refinement. Most of the\nsimulated absorption arises in identifiable and well-resolved structures with\nmasses $\\lesssim 10^4$ Msun, well below the mass resolution of typical zoom\nsimulations. However, integrated quantities such as mass surface density and\nionic covering fractions change at only the $\\lesssim 30$% level as resolution\nis varied.

We use 3D stratified shearing box simulations\nto characterise the dynamo and find that it works at low magnetic Reynolds\nnumber (from unity to ~100) for a wide range of cooling times and boundary\nconditions. The process is kinematic, with a relatively fast growth rate ($<\n0.1 \\Omega$), and it shares some properties of mean field dynamos. The magnetic\nfield is generated via the combination of differential rotation and spiral\ndensity waves, the latter providing compressible horizontal motions and\nlarge-scale vertical rolls. At greater magnetic Reynolds numbers the build up\nof large-scale field is diminished and instead small-scale structures emerge\nfrom the breakdown of twisted flux ropes.

However, the water snowline at the mid-plane\ncannot be directly traced by water line observations as the dust emission\naround the water snowline is highly optically thick at these line frequencies.\nAlternatively, the water snowline maybe traced through the sharp changes in\nphysical properties (surface density and dust size distribution) at this\ntransition or through the snowlines of other molecules that sublimate\nco-spatially with water.\n  In this chapter, we discuss the ngVLA's capability of tracing the mid-plane\nwater snowline through mapping sharp transitions in the continuum spectral\nindex caused by changes of dust size distributions and by using the NH3\nsnowline as a proxy. We found that with the current design of the ngVLA\nability, a sharp transition in spectral index across the water snowline can be\nreadily traced in relatively bright disks.

We discuss lessons learned from gas-dynamical modeling of recent\nALMA data sets and also compare ALMA and ngVLA CO simulations of a dynamically\ncold disk. While only a fraction of all local galaxies likely possess\nsufficiently bright, regularly-rotating nuclear molecular gas, in such cases\nthe ngVLA is expected to more efficiently resolve such emission arising at a\nprojected 50-100 mas from the central BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 19:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Binarity, and the\nassociated formation of accretion disks (that drive collimated, fast jets)\nduring the very late AGB or early post-AGB phase is believed to produce this\ndramatic morphological transformation. But the evidence for binarity and\naccretion during the AGB phase has been hard to obtain due to observational\nlimitations. However, recent observations at UV and X-ray wavelengths have\nbroken thru the observational barrier -- our studies using GALEX reveal a\ncandidate population of AGB stars, generally with strongly-variable\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) emission (fuvAGB stars), and our follow-up studies with\nXMM-Newton, Chandra, and HST of a few key objects supports our hypothesis that\nthese objects have companions that are actively accreting material from the\nprimary. The most prominent fuvAGB star has been detected with the VLA, showing\nthe presence of variable non-thermal emission. The ngVLA, with its\nunprecedented sensitivity, is needed to survey a statistical sample of fuvAGB\nstars over the ~3-90 Ghz range to search for and characterize the nature of the\nradio emission from fuvAGB stars and test our binarity+accretion hypothesis.\nSuch a survey will distinguish between binarity/accretion-related radio\nemission that is expected to have both thermal and non-thermal components and\ndisplay significantly time-variable on short time-scales (minutes to weeks),\nand single-star chromospheric emission from the primary that is expected to be\nthermal, possibly with time-variability, but only on long time-scales (many\nmonths to a year).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 20:51:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 01:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}

A common avenue\nto induce IMTs in Mott insulators is doping, which inevitably leads to\ndisorder. While disorder is well known to create electronic inhomogeneity,\nrecent theoretical studies have indicated that it may play an unexpected and\nmuch more profound role in controlling the properties of Mott systems. Theory\npredicts that disorder might play a role in driving a Mott insulator across an\nIMT, with the emergent metallic state hosting a power law suppression of the\ndensity of states (with exponent close to 1; V-shaped gap) centered at the\nFermi energy. Such V-shaped gaps have been observed in Mott systems but their\norigins are as yet unknown.

Our experiments reveal that many core\nfeatures of the IMT such as power law density of states, pinning of the Fermi\nenergy with increasing disorder, and persistence of antiferromagnetism can be\nunderstood as universal features of a disordered Mott system near an IMT and\nsuggest that V-shaped gaps may be an inevitable consequence of disorder in\ndoped Mott insulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 20:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

In a field experiment conducted over a 29\nweek period on individuals wearing Fitbit activity trackers, we find modest and\nshort lived increases in physical activity for those provided the choice of\naggressive incentives. In contrast, we find significant and persistent\nincreases for those assigned (oftentimes against their stated preference) to\nthe same aggressive incentives. The modest benefits for those provided a choice\nseems to emerge because those who benefited most from the aggressive incentives\nwere the least likely to choose them, and it was those who did not need them\nwho opted in. These results are confirmed in a follow up lab experiment. We\nalso find that benefits to individuals assigned to aggressive incentives were\npronounced if they also updated their step target in the Fitbit mobile\napplication to match the new activity goal we provided them.

In this article,\nwe show that the same statement holds for $\\varepsilon \\leq 1/26$, thus making\na significant step towards Reed's conjecture. We derive this result from a\ngeneral technique to bound the chromatic number of a graph where no vertex has\nmany edges in its neighbourhood. Our improvements to this method also lead to\nimproved bounds on the strong chromatic index of general graphs. We prove that\n$\\chi'_s(G)\\leq 1.835 \\Delta(G)^2$ provided $\\Delta(G)$ is large enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 21:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

Third, it can handle\nlarge data sets, with hundreds of thousands of observations, in a couple of\nminutes. The key insights of this new approach to matching are balancing the\ntreatment groups relative to a target population and positing a linear-sized\nmixed integer formulation of the matching problem. We formally show that this\nformulation is more effective than alternative quadratic-sized formulations, as\nits reduction in size does not affect its strength from the standpoint of its\nlinear programming relaxation.

Knowing where a specific software under test (SUT) has a boundary is\nessential for validation in relation to requirements. However, finding where a\nSUT actually implements the boundary is a non-trivial problem that has not\ngotten much attention. This paper proposes a method of finding the boundary\nbetween the valid and invalid regions of the input space. The proposed method\nconsists of two steps. First, test data generators, directed by a search\nalgorithm to maximise distance to known, valid test cases, generate valid test\ncases that are closer to the boundary. Second, these valid test cases undergo\nmutations to try to push them over the boundary and into the invalid part of\nthe input space. This results in a pair of test sets, one consisting of test\ncases on the valid side of the boundary and a matched set on the outer side,\nwith only a small distance between the two sets. The method is evaluated on a\nnumber of examples from the standard library of a modern programming language.\nWe propose a method of determining the boundary between valid and invalid\nregions of the input space and apply it on a SUT that has a non-contiguous\nvalid region of the input space. From the small distance between the developed\npairs of test sets, and the fact that one test set contains valid test cases\nand the other invalid test cases, we conclude that the pair of test sets\ndescribed the boundary between the valid and invalid regions of that input\nspace. Differences of behaviour can be observed between different distances and\nsets of mutation operators, but all show that the method is able to identify\nthe boundary between the valid and invalid regions of the input space.

Current methods in flow estimation\noften use least squares regression to reconstruct the flow field, finding the\nminimum-energy solution that is consistent with the measured data. However,\nthis approach may be prone to overfitting and sensitive to noise. To address\nthese challenges we instead seek a sparse representation of the data in a\nlibrary of examples. Sparse representation has been widely used for image\nrecognition and reconstruction, and it is well-suited to structured data with\nlimited, corrupt measurements. We explore sparse representation for flow\nreconstruction on a variety of fluid data sets with a wide range of complexity,\nincluding vortex shedding past a cylinder at low Reynolds number, a mixing\nlayer, and two geophysical flows. In addition, we compare several measurement\nstrategies and consider various types of noise and corruption over a range of\nintensities. We find that sparse representation has considerably improved\nestimation accuracy and robustness to noise and corruption compared with least\nsquares methods. We also introduce a sparse estimation procedure on local\nspatial patches for complex multiscale flows that preclude a global sparse\nrepresentation. Based on these results, sparse representation is a promising\nframework for extracting useful information from complex flow fields with\nrealistic measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 22:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 20:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Assuming that the distribution of magnetic flux at the base of the\nconvection zone follows solar scaling relations, we calculate the emergence\nlatitudes and tilt angles of bipolar regions at the surface for various\nrotation rates, using thin-flux-tube simulations.

Noise is not always an interfering signal which\nperturbs the system. On the contrary, noise signal can enhance the performance\nof some non-linear systems. The advantage of noise is observed in Stochastic\nResonance (SR) where noise is used for amplification and subsequent detection\nof small signals. To detect this phenomena it is necessary that the system have\na bistable potential barrier that creates a threshold, the input of the system\nshould be a weak periodic signal which amplitude is below threshold together\nwith an stochastic signal. In this way, the SR is detected when there are weak\nperiodic signals that are added to different noise colors in order to be\namplified and optimised. The interactions between the two signals transform the\npotential of the system precisely at the frequency of the weak periodic signal\nthat is added to the system. The behaviour of the SR is detected in a neural\nnetwork and it is study under noise color variations.

In\nthis work, a wireless communication system under fading channels is considered\nwhere covertness is achieved by using a full-duplex (FD) receiver. More\nprecisely, the receiver of covert information generates artificial noise with a\nvarying power causing uncertainty at the adversary, Willie, regarding the\nstatistics of the received signals. Given that Willie's optimal detector is a\nthreshold test on the received power, we derive a closed-form expression for\nthe optimal detection performance of Willie averaged over the fading channel\nrealizations. Furthermore, we provide guidelines for the optimal choice of\nartificial noise power range, and the optimal transmission probability of\ncovert information to maximize the detection errors at Willie. Our analysis\nshows that the transmission of artificial noise, although causes\nself-interference, provides the opportunity of achieving covertness but its\ntransmit power levels need to be managed carefully. We also demonstrate that\nthe prior transmission probability of 0.5 is not always the best choice for\nachieving the maximum possible covertness, when the covert transmission\nprobability and artificial noise power can be jointly optimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 22:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

This could be\nachieved by generating a superposition of quantum clocks that follow paths with\ndifferent gravitational time dilation and investigating the consequences on the\ninterference signal when they are eventually recombined. Light-pulse atom\ninterferometry with elements employed in optical atomic clocks is a promising\ncandidate for that purpose, but suffers from major challenges including its\ninsensitivity to the gravitational redshift in a uniform field. All these\ndifficulties can be overcome with a novel scheme presented here which is based\non initializing the clock when the spatially separate superposition has already\nbeen generated and performing a doubly differential measurement where the\ndifferential phase shift between the two internal states is compared for\ndifferent initialization times. This can be exploited to test the universality\nof the gravitational redshift with delocalized coherent superpositions of\nquantum clocks and it is argued that its experimental implementation should be\nfeasible with a new generation of 10-meter atomic fountains that will soon\nbecome available. Interestingly, the approach also offers significant\nadvantages for more compact set-ups based on guided interferometry or hybrid\nconfigurations. Furthermore, in order to provide a solid foundation for the\nanalysis of the various interferometry schemes and the effects that can be\nmeasured with them, a general formalism for a relativistic description of atom\ninterferometry in curved spacetime is developed. It can deal with freely\nfalling atoms, but also include the effects of external forces and guiding\npotentials, and can be applied to a very wide range of situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 23:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

FGA has been\npreviously developed and verified as an efficient solver for high-frequency\nacoustic wave propagation (P-wave). The main contribution of this paper\nconsists of three aspects: 1. We derive the FGA formulation for the 3-D elastic\nwave equation. Rather than standard ray-based methods (e.g. geometric optics\nand Gaussian beam method), the derivation requires to do asymptotic expansion\nin the week sense (integral form) so that one is able to perform integration by\nparts. Compared to the FGA theory for acoustic wave equation, the calculations\nin the derivation are much more technically involved due to the existence of\nboth P- and S-waves, and the coupling of the polarized directions for SH- and\nSV-waves. In particular, we obtain the diabatic coupling terms for SH- and\nSV-waves, with the form closely connecting to the concept of Berry phase that\nis intensively studied in quantum mechanics and topology (Chern number). The\naccuracy and parallelizability of the FGA algorithm is illustrated by comparing\nto the spectral element method for 3-D elastic wave equation in homogeneous\nmedia; 2.

Because network topology structure\nand node attributes often exhibit high correlation, incorporating node\nattribute proximity into network embedding is beneficial for learning good\nvector representations. In reality, large-scale networks often have\nincomplete/missing node content or linkages, yet existing attributed network\nembedding algorithms all operate under the assumption that networks are\ncomplete. Thus, their performance is vulnerable to missing data and suffers\nfrom poor scalability.\n  In this paper, we propose a Scalable Incomplete Network Embedding (SINE)\nalgorithm for learning node representations from incomplete graphs. SINE\nformulates a probabilistic learning framework that separately models pairs of\nnode-context and node-attribute relationships. Different from existing\nattributed network embedding algorithms, SINE provides greater flexibility to\nmake the best of useful information and mitigate negative effects of missing\ninformation on representation learning. A stochastic gradient descent based\nonline algorithm is derived to learn node representations, allowing SINE to\nscale up to large-scale networks with high learning efficiency. We evaluate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of SINE through extensive experiments on\nreal-world networks. Experimental results confirm that SINE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in various tasks, including node classification,\nnode clustering, and link prediction, under settings with missing links and\nnode attributes.

The strategy adopted by a protein,\ncalled transcription factor (TF), for searching its specific binding site on\nthe DNA has been investigated over several decades. In recent times the effects\nobstacles, like DNA-binding proteins, on the search by TF has begun to receive\nattention. RNA polymerase (RNAP) motors collectively move along a segment of\nthe DNA during a genomic process called transcription. This RNAP traffic is\nbound to affect the diffusive scanning of the same segment of the DNA by a TF\nsearching for its binding site. Motivated by this phenomenon, here we develop a\nkinetic model where a `particle', that represents a TF, searches for a specific\nsite on a one-dimensional lattice. On the same lattice another species of\nparticles, each representing a RNAP, hop from left to right exactly as in a\ntotally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) which forbids simultaneous\noccupation of any site by more than one particle, irrespective of their\nidentities. Although the TF is allowed to attach to or detach from any lattice\nsite, the RNAPs can attach only to the first site at the left edge and detach\nfrom only the last site on the right edge of the lattice. We formulate the\nsearch as a {\\it first-passage} process; the time taken to reach the target\nsite {\\it for the first time}, starting from a well defined initial state, is\nthe search time. By approximate analytical calculations and Monte Carlo (MC)\ncomputer simulations, we calculate the mean search time. We show that RNAP\ntraffic rectifies the diffusive motion of TF to that of a Brownian ratchet, and\nthe mean time of successful search can be even shorter than that required in\nthe absence of RNAP traffic. Moreover, we show that there is an optimal rate of\ndetachment that corresponds to the shortest mean search time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 05:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The proposed calculation model is\napplied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with\npositive and negative weights are separately performed in each layer and\nsummation results are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction\noperation. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to\nimplement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current\nmode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in\ncharging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be\ndesigned without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low\npower consumption. However, they have to use very high resistance devices on\nthe order of G$\\rm \\Omega$. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS VLSI chip\nto verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights and evaluated it by\npost-layout circuit simulation using 250-nm fabrication technology. High\nresistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of\nMOS transistors.

As a consequence of the Cramer-Rao bound, we find that the rate of\nchange of the average of any observable is bounded from above by its variance\ntimes the temporal Fisher information. As a consequence of this bound, we\nobtain a speed limit on the evolution of stochastic observables: Changing the\naverage of an observable requires a minimum amount of time given by the change\nin the average squared, divided by the fluctuations of the observable times the\nthermodynamic cost of the transformation. In particular for relaxation\ndynamics, which do not depend on time explicitly, we show that the Fisher\ninformation is a monotonically decreasing function of time and that this\nminimal required time is determined by the initial preparation of the system.\nWe further show that the monotonicity of the Fisher information can be used to\ndetect hidden variables in the system and demonstrate our findings for simple\nexamples of continuous and discrete random processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 06:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 21:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

We demonstrate how\nself-concordance of the loss allows to characterize the critical sample size\nsufficient to guarantee a chi-square type in-probability bound for the excess\nrisk. Specifically, we consider two classes of losses: (i) self-concordant\nlosses in the classical sense of Nesterov and Nemirovski, i.e., whose third\nderivative is uniformly bounded with the $3/2$ power of the second derivative;\n(ii) pseudo self-concordant losses, for which the power is removed. These\nclasses contain losses corresponding to several generalized linear models,\nincluding the logistic loss and pseudo-Huber losses. Our basic result under\nminimal assumptions bounds the critical sample size by $O(d \\cdot\nd_{\\text{eff}}),$ where $d$ the parameter dimension and $d_{\\text{eff}}$ the\neffective dimension that accounts for model misspecification. In contrast to\nthe existing results, we only impose local assumptions that concern the\npopulation risk minimizer $\\theta_*$. Namely, we assume that the calibrated\ndesign, i.e., design scaled by the square root of the second derivative of the\nloss, is subgaussian at $\\theta_*$. Besides, for type-ii losses we require\nboundedness of a certain measure of curvature of the population risk at\n$\\theta_*$.Our improved result bounds the critical sample size from above as\n$O(\\max\\{d_{\\text{eff}}, d \\log d\\})$ under slightly stronger assumptions.\nNamely, the local assumptions must hold in the neighborhood of $\\theta_*$ given\nby the Dikin ellipsoid of the population risk.

This\npaper summarizes state-of-the-art of existing work on anomaly detection,\nfault-tolerance and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable\nto achieve resilience in an IoT.

The minimum size $\\gamma_{t2}(G)$ of a semitotal\ndominating set of $G$ is squeezed between the domination number $\\gamma(G)$ and\nthe total domination number $\\gamma_{t}(G)$.\n  \\textsc{Semitotal Dominating Set} is the problem of finding, given a graph\n$G$, a semitotal dominating set of $G$ of size $\\gamma_{t2}(G)$. In this paper,\nwe continue the systematic study on the computational complexity of this\nproblem when restricted to special graph classes.

Here we show that effect exists even\nunder YIG excitation using the ESR cavity - tool often employed to realize spin\npumping. The temperature difference observed around the ferromagnetic resonance\n(FMR) field under the 4 mW microwave power peaked at 13 mK. The observed\nthermoelectric signal indicates the imbalance of the population between the\nDEMs that propagate near the top and bottom surfaces of the YIG film. We\nattribute the DEM population imbalance to the different magnetic damping near\nthe top and bottom YIG surfaces. Additionally, the spin wave dynamics of the\nsystem were investigated using the micromagnetic simulations. The micromagnetic\nsimulations confirmed the existence of the DEM imbalance in the system with the\nincreased Gilbert damping at one of the YIG interfaces.

However, for these countries\nsuch low frequency railways are a critical part of their infrastructure.\n  The number of published dynamic models as well as stability studies regarding\nlow frequency railways is small, compared to corresponding publications\nregarding 50 Hz/60 Hz public grids. Since there are two main type of low\nfrequency railways; synchronous and asynchronous, it makes the number of\navailable useful publications even smaller. One important reason for this is\nthe small share of such grids on a global scale, resulting in less research and\ndevelopment man hours spent on low frequency grids.\n  This work presents an open model of a (synchronous-synchronous) rotary\nfrequency converter for electromechanical stability studies in the phasor\ndomain, based on established synchronous machine models.

Today, the main limitation\nin the high-contrast images is the quasi-static speckles that are created by\nresidual instrumental aberrations. They have the same angular size as planetary\ncompanions and are often brighter, hence hindering our capability to detect\nexoplanets. Dedicated observation strategies and signal processing techniques\nare necessary to disentangle these speckles from planetary signals. The output\nof these methods is a detection map in which the value of each pixel is related\nto a probability of presence of a planetary signal. The detection map found in\nthe literature relies on the assumption that the residual noise is Gaussian.\nHowever, this is known to lead to higher false positive rates, especially close\nto the star. In this paper, we re-visit the notion of detection map by\nanalyzing the speckle noise distribution, namely the Modified Rician\ndistribution. We use non-asymptotic analysis of the sum of random variables to\nshow that the tail of the distribution of the residual noise decays as an\nexponential distribution, hence explaining the high false detection rate\nobtained with the Gaussian assumption. From this analysis, we introduce a novel\ntime domain detection map and we demonstrate its capabilities and the relevance\nof our approach through experiments on real data.

In the\nweakly nonlinear regime, those interactions may facilitate energy equipartition\nin Fourier space. We consider analytically resonant wave-wave interactions for\nthe celebrated Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system. Using a\nnumber-theoretical approach based on cyclotomic polynomials, we show that the\nproblem of finding exact resonances for a system of N particles is equivalent\nto a Diophantine equation whose solutions depend sensitively on the set of\ndivisors of N. We provide an algorithm to construct all possible resonances,\nbased on two methods: pairing-off and cyclotomic, which we introduce to build\nup explicit solutions to the 4-, 5- and 6-wave resonant conditions. Our results\nshed some light in the understanding of the long-standing FPUT paradox,\nregarding the sensitivity of the resonant manifolds with respect to the number\nof particles N and the corresponding time scale of the interactions leading to\nthermalisation. In this light we demonstrate that 6-wave resonances always\nexist for any N, while 5-wave resonances exist if N is divisible by 3 and N >\n6. It is known (for finite N) that 4-wave resonances do not mix energy across\nthe spectrum, so we investigate whether 5-wave resonances can produce energy\nmixing across a significant region of the Fourier spectrum by analysing the\ninterconnected network of Fourier modes that can interact nonlinearly via\nresonances. The answer depends on the set of odd divisors of N that are not\ndivisible by 3: the size of this set determines the number of dynamically\nindependent components, corresponding to independent constants of motion\n(energies). We show that 6-wave resonances connect all these independent\ncomponents, providing in principle a restoring mechanism for full-scale\nthermalisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 09:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

This goal can benefit from formal\nmethods well known in various scientific domains such as artificial\nintelligence. So, the current research concerns the proposal of a CPS\nmeta-model and its instantiation. In this way it lists all kind of\nrelationships that may occur between the CPSs themselves and between their\n(cyber-and physical-) components. Using the CPS meta-model formalization, with\nan adaptation of the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) formal approach, this paper\npresents a way to optimize the modelling of CPS systems emphasizing their\nredundancy and their resiliency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 10:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

In\nevolutionary studies, it is common to use the energy-limited formula, which is\nattractive for its simplicity but ignores important physical effects and can be\ninaccurate in many cases. To overcome this problem, we consider a recently\ndeveloped grid of about 7000 one-dimensional upper-atmosphere hydrodynamic\nmodels computed for a wide range of planets with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres\nfrom which we extract the mass-loss rates. The grid boundaries are [1:39]\nMEARTH in planetary mass, [1:10] REARTH in planetary radius, [300:2000] K in\nequilibrium temperature, [0.4:1.3] MSUN in host star's mass, [0.002:1.3] au in\norbital separation, and about [10^{26}:5*10^{30}] erg/s in stellar X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet luminosity. We then derive an analytical expression for the\natmospheric mass-loss rates based on a fit to the values obtained from the\ngrid. The expression provides the mass-loss rates as a function of planetary\nmass, planetary radius, orbital separation, and incident stellar high-energy\nflux.

While applications such as phase-contrast imaging\nwith these betatron sources have already been demonstrated, others would\nrequire higher photon number and would benefit from increased tunability. In\nthis paper we demonstrate, through detailed 3D simulations, a novel\nconfiguration for a laser-wakefield betatron source that increases the energy\nof the X-ray emission and also provides increased flexibility in the tuning of\nthe X-ray photon energy. This is made by combining two Laguerre-Gaussian pulses\nwith non-zero net orbital angular momentum, leading to a rotation of the\nintensity pattern, and hence, of the driven wakefields. The helical motion\ndriven by the laser rotation is found to dominate the radiation emission,\nrather than the betatron oscillations. Moreover, the radius of this helical\nmotion can be controlled through the laser spot size and orbital angular\nmomentum indexes, meaning that the radiation can be tuned fully independently\nof the plasma parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

It is based on using oscillators, the transfer of\nexcitation between which is provided resonantly due to the difference in the\nfrequencies of small and large oscillations by an integer number of times being\naccompanied by phase transformation according to Bernoulli nap. We consider a\nsystem with Smale-Williams attractor, which is based on two coupled\nBonhoeffer-van der Pol oscillators. The oscillators manifest activity and\nsuppression turn by turn. With appropriate selection of the modulation,\nrelaxation oscillations occur at the end of each activity stage, the frequency\nof which is by an integer factor $M = 2,3,4,\\ldots$ smaller than that of small\noscillations. When the partner oscillator enters the activity stage, the\noscillations start being stimulated by the M-th harmonic of the relaxation\noscillations, so that the transformation of phase during the modulation period\ncorresponds to the M-fold Bernoulli map. In the state space of the Poincar\\'e\nmap this corresponds to Smale-Williams attractor, constructed with M-fold\nincrease in the number of turns of the winding at each step of the mapping. The\nresults of numerical studies confirming the occurrence of the hyperbolic\nattractors in certain parameter domains are presented, including the portraits\nof attractors, diagrams illustrating the phase transformation according to the\nBernoulli map, Lyapunov exponents, and charts of regimes in parameter planes.\nThe hyperbolic nature of the attractors is verified by numerical tests that\nconfirm absence of tangencies of stable and unstable manifolds for trajectories\non the attractor (criterion of angles). An electronic circuit is proposed that\nimplements this principle of obtaining the hyperbolic chaos and its functioning\nis demonstrated using the software package Multisim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 11:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The theory captures effects of electrostatic\nfluctuations on the structure factor and provides insights into the origin of\nexperimentally observed enhanced scattering at ultralow wavevectors in\nsalt-free ionic polymers. It is shown that the enhanced scattering can\noriginate from a coupling between fluctuations of electric polarization and\nmonomer density. Local and non-local effects of the polarization resulting from\nfinite sized permanent dipoles and ion-pairs in dipolar and charge regulating\nionic polymers, respectively, are considered. Theoretical calculations reveal\nthat, similar to the salt-free ionic polymers, the structure factor for dipolar\npolymers can also exhibit a peak at a finite wavevector and enhanced scattering\nat ultralow wavevectors. Although consideration of dipolar interactions leads\nto attractive interactions between monomers, the enhanced scattering at\nultralow wavevectors is predicted solely on the basis of the electrostatics of\nweakly inhomoge- neous dipolar and ionic polymers without considering the\neffects of any aggregates or phase separation. Thus, we conclude that neither\naggregation nor phase separation is necessary for observing the enhanced\nscattering at ultralow wave-vectors in salt-free dipolar and ionic polymers.\nFor charge regulating ionic polymers, it is shown that electrostatic\ninteractions between charged monomers get screened with a screening length,\nwhich depends not only on the concentration of free counterions and coions but\nalso on the concentration of adsorbed ions on the polymer chains. Qualitative\ncomparisons with the experimental scattering curves for ionic and dipolar\npolymer melts are presented using the theory developed in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Using\na known yet remarkable correspondence that relates Painlev\\'e equations to\nBonnet surfaces, the persistence probability also acquires a geometric meaning\nin terms of the mean curvature of the latter, and even a topological one at the\nmagnetization-symmetric point.

Their prompt gamma-ray radiation corresponds to an energy release of\n1E42-1E47J. Fifty years after their discovery and several dedicated space-based\ninstruments, the physical origin of this emission is still unknown. Synchrotron\nemission has been one of the early contenders but was criticized because\nspectral fits of empirical models (such as a smoothly-connected broken power\nlaw or a cut-off power law) suggest too hard a slope of the low-energy power\nlaw, violating the so-called synchrotron line-of-death. We perform\ntime-resolved gamma-ray spectroscopy of single-peaked GRBs as measured with\nFermi/GBM. We demonstrate that idealized synchrotron emission, when properly\nincorporating time-dependent cooling of the electrons, is capable of fitting\n~95% of all these GBM spectra. The comparison with spectral fit results based\non previous empirical models demonstrates that the past exclusion of\nsynchrotron radiation as an emission mechanism derived via the line-of-death\nwas misleading. Our analysis probes the physics of these ultra-relativistic\noutflows and the related microphysical processes, and for the first time\nprovides estimates of magnetic field strength and Lorentz factors of the\nemitting region directly from spectral fits. Our modeling of the Fermi/GBM\nobservations provides evidence that GRBs are produced by moderately magnetized\njets in which relativistic mini-jets emit optically-thin synchrotron radiation\nat large emission radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 13:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

The differences between the recovered and true ages were modelled\nagainst the errors in the observables by means of linear models and projection\npursuit regression models. From linear models we find that no age error source\ndominates. For MS the most important error source is Teff. An offset of 75 K\naccounts for an underestimation of the stellar age from 0.4 to 0.6 Gyr for\ninitial and terminal MS. An error of 2.5% in nu_max accounted for about -0.3\nGyr. A 0.1 dex error in [Fe/H] resulted particularly important only at the end\nof the MS, with an age error of -0.4 Gyr. For the RGB phase the dominant source\nof uncertainty is nu_max, causing an underestimation of about 0.6 Gyr; the\noffset in the effective temperature and Delta_nu caused respectively an\nunderestimation and overestimation of 0.3 Gyr. We find that the inference from\nthe linear model is a good proxy for that from projection pursuit regression\nmodels, so that linear models can be safely used thanks to its broader\ngeneralizability.

Recently, fully-convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN), in particular those based on U-Net, have led to improved\nperformances for this task. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that\nimproves standard U-Net based methods in three important ways. First, instead\nof combining the available image modalities at the input, each of them is\nprocessed in a different path to better exploit their unique information.\nMoreover, the network is densely-connected (i.e., each layer is connected to\nall following layers), both within each path and across different paths,\nsimilar to HyperDenseNet. This gives our model the freedom to learn the scale\nat which modalities should be processed and combined. Finally, inspired by the\nInception architecture, we improve standard U-Net modules by extending\ninception modules with two convolutional blocks with dilated convolutions of\ndifferent scale. This helps handling the variability in lesion sizes. We split\nthe 93 stroke datasets into training and validation sets containing 83 and 9\nexamples respectively.

This paper analyzes the role of dissipation in transformation\nof spin current injected with incoherent magnons to a superfluid spin current\nnear the interface where spin is injected. The Gilbert damping parameter in the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory does not describe dissipation properly, and the\ndissipation parameters are calculated from the Boltzmann equation for magnons\nscattered by defects. The two-fluid theory is developed similar to the\ntwo-fluid theory for superfluids. This theory shows that the influence of\ntemperature variation in bulk on the superfluid spin transport (bulk Seebeck\neffect) is weak at low temperatures. The scenario that the results of Yuan et\nal. are connected with the Seebeck effect at the interface between the spin\ndetector and the sample is also discussed.\n  The Landau criterion for an antiferromagnet put in a magnetic field is\nderived from the spectrum of collective spin modes.

A key role is played by\nstable Petrov--Galerkin type variational formulations of parametric transport\nequations and corresponding radiative transfer equations. This allows us to\nformulate an iteration in a suitable, infinite dimensional function space that\nis guaranteed to converge with a fixed error reduction per step. The numerical\nscheme is then based on approximately realizing this iteration within\ndynamically updated accuracy tolerances that still ensure convergence to the\nexact solution. To advance this iteration two operations need to be performed\nwithin suitably tightened accuracy tolerances. First, the global scattering\noperator needs to be approximately applied to the current iterate within a\ntolerance comparable to the current accuracy level. Second, parameter dependent\nlinear transport equations need to be solved, again at the required accuracy of\nthe iteration. To ensure that the stage dependent error tolerances are met, one\nhas to employ rigorous a posteriori error bounds which, in our case, rest on a\nDiscontinuous Petrov--Galerkin (DPG) scheme. These a posteriori bounds are not\nonly crucial for guaranteeing the convergence of the perturbed iteration but\nare also used to generate adapted parameter dependent spatial meshes. This\nturns out to significantly reduce overall computational complexity. Since the\nglobal operator is only applied, we avoid the need to solve linear systems with\ndensely populated matrices. Moreover, the approximate application of the global\nscatterer accelerated through low-rank approximation and matrix compression\ntechniques. The theoretical findings are illustrated and complemented by\nnumerical experiments with non-trivial scattering kernels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 14:27:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 18:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

We verify that the charge\npumping remains quantized as long as the pump cycle avoids the superfluid\nphase. In the limit of hardcore bosons, the quantized pumped charge can be\nunderstood from single-particle properties such as the integrated Berry\ncurvature constructed from Bloch states, while this picture breaks down at\nfinite interaction strengths. These two properties -- robust quantized charge\ntransport in an interacting system of bosons and the breakdown of a\nsingle-particle invariant -- could both be measured with ultracold quantum\ngases extending a previous experiment [Lohse et al., Nature Phys. 12, 350\n(2016)].

Without knowing the exact\npixel-label correspondence, most weakly-supervised methods rely on external\nmodels to infer pseudo pixel-level labels for training semantic segmentation\nmodels. In this paper, we aim to develop a single neural network without\nresorting to any external models. We propose a novel self-guided strategy to\nfully utilize features learned across multiple levels to progressively generate\nthe dense pseudo labels. First, we use high-level features as class-specific\nlocalization maps to roughly locate the classes. Next, we propose an\naffinity-guided method to encourage each localization map to be consistent with\ntheir intermediate level features. Third, we adopt the training image itself as\nguidance and propose a self-guided refinement to further transfer the image's\ninherent structure into the maps. Finally, we derive pseudo pixel-level labels\nfrom these localization maps and use the pseudo labels as ground truth to train\nthe semantic segmentation model. Our proposed self-guided strategy is a unified\nframework, which is built on a single network and alternatively updates the\nfeature representation and refines localization maps during the training\nprocedure.

These uncertainties result in expanded\ntreatment margins, thereby increasing radiation dose to healthy tissue.\nReal-time range verification techniques aim to reduce these uncertainties in\norder to take full advantage of the finite range of the primary protons. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel concept for real-time range verification based\non detection of secondary neutrons produced in nuclear interactions during\nproton therapy. The proposed detector concept is simple; consisting of a\nhydrogen-rich converter material followed by two charged particle tracking\ndetectors, mimicking a proton recoil telescopic arrangement. Neutrons incident\non the converter material are converted into protons through elastic and\ninelastic (n,p) interactions. The protons are subsequently detected in the\ntracking detectors. The information on the direction and position of these\nprotons is then utilized in a new reconstruction algorithm to estimate the\ndepth distribution of neutron production by the proton beam, which in turn is\ncorrelated with the primary proton range.

We also examine the potential for the ngVLA to enable studies of\ngrain growth and radial migration of dust particles early in the protostellar\nphase with the broad multi-wavelength coverage. Studies of grain growth will\nrequire wavelength coverage extending at least to $\\sim$4~cm to characterize\nand quantify the location and intensity of free-free emission, which is\nexpected to be generated at $<$10 AU scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 18:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

This formalism does not seek to aggregate agents. It rather\nreplaces the standard optimization approach by a probabilistic description of\nboth the entire system and agents'behaviors. This is done in two distinct\nsteps. A first step considers an interacting system involving an arbitrary\nnumber of agents, where each agent's utility function is subject to\nunpredictable shocks. In such a setting, individual optimization problems need\nnot be resolved. Each agent is described by a time-dependent probability\ndistribution centered around his utility optimum. The entire system of agents\nis thus defined by a composite probability depending on time, agents'\ninteractions and forward-looking behaviors. This dynamic system is described by\na path integral formalism in an abstract space-the space of the agents'\nactions-and is very similar to a statistical physics or quantum mechanics\nsystem. We show that this description, applied to the space of agents'actions,\nreduces to the usual optimization results in simple cases. Compared to a\nstandard optimization, such a description markedly eases the treatment of\nsystems with small number of agents. It becomes however useless for a large\nnumber of agents. In a second step therefore, we show that for a large number\nof agents, the previous description is equivalent to a more compact description\nin terms of field theory. This yields an analytical though approximate\ntreatment of the system. This field theory does not model the aggregation of a\nmicroeconomic system in the usual sense. It rather describes an environment of\na large number of interacting agents. From this description, various phases or\nequilibria may be retrieved, along with individual agents' behaviors and their\ninteractions with the environment.

An effective\njump is predicated on the need to maintain dynamic stability through the\nacceleration phase. The present study concerns understanding how birds retain\ncontrol of body attitude and trajectory during take-off. Cursory observation\nsuggests that stability is achieved with relatively little cost. However,\nanalysis of the problem shows that the stability margins during jumping are\nactually very small and that stability considerations play a significant role\nin selection of appropriate jumping kinematics. We use theoretical models to\nunderstand stability in prehensile take-off (from a perch) and also in\nnon-prehensile take-off (from the ground). The primary instability is tipping,\ndefined as rotation of the centre of gravity about the ground contact point.\nTipping occurs when the centre of pressure falls outside the functional foot. A\ncontribution of the paper is the development of graphical tipping stability\nmargins for both centre of gravity location and acceleration angle. We show\nthat the nose-up angular acceleration extends stability bounds forward and is\nhence helpful in achieving shallow take-offs. The stability margins are used to\ninterrogate simulated take-offs of real birds using published experimental\nkinematic data from a guinea fowl (ground take-off) and a diamond dove (perch\ntake-off). For the guinea fowl the initial part of the jump is stable, however\nsimulations exhibit a stuttering instability not observed experimentally that\nis probably due to absence of compliance in the idealised joints. The diamond\ndove model confirms that the foot provides an active torque reaction during\ntake-off, extending the range of stable jump angles by around 45{\\deg}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 06:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

As single-GPU systems struggle to satisfy the performance demands,\nmulti-GPU systems have begun to dominate the high-performance computing world.\nThe advent of such systems raises a number of design challenges, including the\nGPU microarchitecture, multi-GPU interconnect fabrics, runtime libraries and\nassociated programming models. The research community currently lacks a\npublically available and comprehensive multi-GPU simulation framework and\nbenchmark suite to evaluate multi-GPU system design solutions.\n  In this work, we present MGSim, a cycle-accurate, extensively validated,\nmulti-GPU simulator, based on AMD's Graphics Core Next 3 (GCN3) instruction set\narchitecture. We complement MGSim with MGMark, a suite of multi-GPU workloads\nthat explores multi-GPU collaborative execution patterns. Our simulator is\nscalable and comes with in-built support for multi-threaded execution to enable\nfast and efficient simulations. In terms of performance accuracy, MGSim differs\n$5.5\\%$ on average when compared against actual GPU hardware. We also achieve a\n$3.5\\times$ and a $2.5\\times$ average speedup in function emulation and\narchitectural simulation with 4 CPU cores, while delivering the same accuracy\nas the serial simulation.\n  We illustrate the novel simulation capabilities provided by our simulator\nthrough a case study exploring programming models based on a unified multi-GPU\nsystem (U-MGPU) and a discrete multi-GPU system (D-MGPU) that both utilize\nunified memory space and cross-GPU memory access.

This paper thus considers the offensive performance of\nthe players and uses PPG as a metric to assign a value to the player. This\npredicted value can be used to rank players and is similar to what TSN.com and\nNHL.com use to rank players before each hockey season. A combination of\nphysical characteristics, shooting percentage, and usage during games are used\nas training features. A novel metric, Player Availability Rating (PAR) is\nproposed which utilizes the offensive predictions to predict the availability\nof a player during a season.

The BSPO has two\nobjectives, minimizing the QoS including execution time, network latency, and\nservice price, and minimize the energy consumption of the composite service.\nExperimental evaluations show that the proposed approach has short execution\ntime in various complex service profiles.
