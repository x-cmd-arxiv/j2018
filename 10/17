They are characterized by overabundances of\ns-process elements. Roughly half of them are enhanced in technetium (Tc), an\ns-process element with no stable isotope, while the other half lack technetium.\nThis dichotomy arises from the fact that Tc-rich S stars are intrinsically\nproducing s-process elements and have undergone third dredge-up (TDU) events,\nwhile Tc-poor S stars owe their s-process overabundances to a past pollution by\na former AGB companion. Our aim is to analyse the abundances of S stars and\ngain insights into their evolutionary status and on the nucleosynthesis of\nheavy s-process elements taking place in their interior. In particular, the\nlocation of extrinsic and intrinsic S stars in the HR diagram will be compared\nwith the theoretical onset of the TDU on the thermally-pulsing AGB. A sample of\n19 S-type stars was analysed by combining HERMES high-resolution spectra,\naccurate Gaia Data Release 2 (GDR2) parallaxes, stellar-evolution models, and\nnewly-designed MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Combining the derived\nparameters with GDR2 parallaxes allows a joint analysis of the location of the\nstars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and of their surface abundances. For\nall 19 stars, Zr and Nb abundances are derived, complemented by abundances of\nother s-process elements for the three Tc-rich S stars. These abundances agree\nwithin the uncertainties with nucleosynthesis predictions for stars of\ncorresponding mass, metallicity and evolutionary stage. Most extrinsic S stars\nlie close to the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), and a few are located along\nthe early AGB.

Developing a general\nunderstanding of their structure in relation to the underlying non-equilibrium\nphysics would provide a route towards control of their dynamic behavior and\npave the way for potential applications. The active system considered here\nconsists of a quasi-two-dimensional sheet of short ($\\approx$ 1 $\\mu$m) actin\nfilaments driven by myosin-II motors. By adopting a concerted theoretical and\nexperimental strategy, new insights are gained into the non-equilibrium\nproperties of active nematics over a wide range of internal activity levels. In\nparticular, it is shown that topological defect interactions can be led to\ntransition from attractive to repulsive as a function of initial defect\nseparation and relative orientation. Furthermore, by examining the +1/2 defect\nmorphology as a function of activity, it is found that the apparent elastic\nproperties of the system (the ratio of bend-to-splay elastic moduli) are\naltered considerably by increased activity, leading to an effectively lower\nbend elasticity. At high levels of activity, the topological defects that\ndecorate the material exhibit a liquid-like structure, and adopt preferred\norientations depending on their topological charge. Taken together, these\nresults suggest that it should be possible to tune internal stresses in active\nnematic systems with the goal of designing out-of-equilibrium structures with\nengineered dynamic responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 16:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

The structure consists of a top-layer-patterned\nmetal-insulator-metal (MIM) configuration, into the insulator layer of which,\nan ultra-thin 5 nm layer of Manganese (Mn) is embedded. The MIM configuration\nrepresents a Ti-Al2O3-Ti tri-layer. It is shown that, without the ultra-thin\nlayer of Mn, the absorption bandwidth is reduced to 274 nm. Therefore, adding\nonly a 5 nm layer of Mn leads to a more than tenfold increase in the width of\nthe absorption band. It is explained in detail that the physical mechanism\ncontributing to this ultra-broadband result is a combination of plasmonic and\nnon-plasmonic resonance modes, along with the appropriate optical properties of\nMn.

The diffusion dependence needed to explain the remarkable solar\nmodulation effects observed for both electrons and higher rigidity protons as\none progresses from the heliopause inward by ~25 AU to the termination shock\nreally has two distinct rigidity regimes.

For Kepler-36 c, models involving in situ formation and models\ninvolving orbital migration are considered. The results are compared with\nstandard formation models. The calculations include the formation (accretion)\nphase, as well as the subsequent cooling phase, up to the age of Kepler-36 (7\nGyr). During the latter phase, mass loss induced by stellar XUV radiation is\nincluded. In all cases, the results fit the measured mass, 7.84 M$_\\oplus$, and\nradius, 3.68 R$_\\oplus$, of Kepler-36 c. Two parameters are varied to obtain\nthese fits: the disk solid surface density at the formation location, and the\n\"efficiency\" factor in the XUV mass loss rate. The updated models are hotter\nand therefore less dense in the silicate portion of the planet and in the\noverlying layers of H/He, as compared with standard models. The lower densities\nmean that only about half as much H/He is needed to be accreted to fit the\npresent-day mass and radius constraints. For Kepler-36 b, an updated in situ\ncalculation shows that the entire H/He envelope is lost, early in the cooling\nphase, in agreement with observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 17:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

This implies that even\nthough we cannot model the internal structure of stars perfectly, we can have\nconfidence in all results that use stellar global properties obtained through\nthe analysis of stellar oscillation frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 18:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

This motivates the use of stochastic\nalgorithms that sample problem data, which can jeopardize the guarantees\nobtained through classical globalization techniques in optimization such as a\ntrust region or a line search. Using subsampled function values is particularly\nchallenging for the latter strategy, which relies upon multiple evaluations. On\ntop of that all, there has been an increasing interest for nonconvex\nformulations of data-related problems, such as training deep learning models.\nFor such instances, one aims at developing methods that converge to\nsecond-order stationary points quickly, i.e., escape saddle points efficiently.\nThis is particularly delicate to ensure when one only accesses subsampled\napproximations of the objective and its derivatives.\n  In this paper, we describe a stochastic algorithm based on negative curvature\nand Newton-type directions that are computed for a subsampling model of the\nobjective. A line-search technique is used to enforce suitable decrease for\nthis model, and for a sufficiently large sample, a similar amount of reduction\nholds for the true objective. By using probabilistic reasoning, we can then\nobtain worst-case complexity guarantees for our framework, leading us to\ndiscuss appropriate notions of stationarity in a subsampling context. Our\nanalysis encompasses the deterministic regime, and allows us to identify\nsampling requirements for second-order line-search paradigms.

Our objective in this paper is to identify an optimal\nnetwork topology, optimal in the sense of minimum cardinality information\ntransfer between agents to guarantee the controllability of the composite\nsystem when the possible neighbor set of each agent is pre-specified. We focus\non graph-theoretic analysis referred to as structural controllability as\nnumerical entries of system matrices in complex systems are mostly unknown. We\nfirst prove that given a set of agents and the possible set of neighbors,\nfinding a minimum cardinality set of information (interconnections) that must\nbe shared to accomplish structural controllability of the composite system is\nNP-hard. Subsequently, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a\n2-optimal solution to this NP-hard problem. Our algorithm combines a minimum\nweight bipartite matching algorithm and a minimum spanning tree algorithm and\ngives a subset of interconnections which when established guarantees structural\ncontrollability, such that the worst-case performance is 2-optimal. Finally, we\nshow that our approach directly extends to weighted constrained optimal net-\nwork topology design problem and constrained optimal network topology design\nproblem in switched linear systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 18:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

One of the avenues taken in the past decade\nis sugar consumption regulation by introducing a sugar tax. Such a tax\nincreases the price of extensive sugar containment in products such as soft\ndrinks. In this article we consider a typical problem of optimal regulatory\npolicy design, where the task is to determine the sugar tax rate maximizing the\nsocial welfare. We model the problem as a sequential game represented by the\nthree-level mathematical program. On the upper level, the government decides\nupon the tax rate. On the middle level, producers decide on the product\npricing. On the lower level, consumers decide upon their preferences towards\nthe products. While the general problem is computationally intractable, the\nproblem with a few product types is polynomially solvable, even for an\narbitrary number of heterogeneous consumers. This paper presents a simple,\nintuitive and easily implementable framework for computing optimal sugar tax in\na market with a few products. This resembles the reality as the soft drinks,\nfor instance, are typically categorized in either regular or no-sugar drinks,\ne.g. Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero.

However, conventional fluxes on continuous space are\nill-defined and are problematic when at boundaries of the state space or when\ncopy numbers are small.

The reactional discrete flux\nsatisfies the continuity equation and describes the behavior of the system\nevolving along directions of reactions. The species discrete flux directly\ndescribes the dynamic behavior in the state space of the reactants such as the\ntransfer of probability mass. With the relationship between these two fluxes\nspecified, we show how to construct time-evolving and steady-state global\nflow-maps of probability flux and velocity in the directions of every species\nat every microstate, and how they are related to the outflow and inflow of\nprobability fluxes when tracing out reaction trajectories.

The iterative Random Forest algorithm took a step towards bridging\nthis gap by providing a computationally tractable procedure to identify the\nstable, high-order feature interactions that drive the predictive accuracy of\nRandom Forests (RF). Here we refine the interactions identified by iRF to\nexplicitly map responses as a function of interacting features. Our method,\nsigned iRF, describes subsets of rules that frequently occur on RF decision\npaths. We refer to these rule subsets as signed interactions. Signed\ninteractions share not only the same set of interacting features but also\nexhibit similar thresholding behavior, and thus describe a consistent\nfunctional relationship between interacting features and responses. We describe\nstable and predictive importance metrics to rank signed interactions. For each\nSPIM, we define null importance metrics that characterize its expected behavior\nunder known structure. We evaluate our proposed approach in biologically\ninspired simulations and two case studies: predicting enhancer activity and\nspatial gene expression patterns. In the case of enhancer activity, s-iRF\nrecovers one of the few experimentally validated high-order interactions and\nsuggests novel enhancer elements where this interaction may be active. In the\ncase of spatial gene expression patterns, s-iRF recovers all 11 reported links\nin the gap gene network.

The idea is to treat time integration in a parallel\ncontext by using a multigrid method in time. If $\\Phi$ is a (fine-grid)\ntime-stepping scheme, let $\\Psi$ denote a \"coarse-grid\" time-stepping scheme\nchosen to approximate $k$ steps of $\\Phi$, $k\\geq 1$. In particular, $\\Psi$\ndefines the coarse-grid correction, and evaluating $\\Psi$ should be\n(significantly) cheaper than evaluating $\\Phi^k$.\n  A number of papers have studied the convergence of Parareal and MGRiT.\nHowever, there have yet to be general conditions developed on the convergence\nof Parareal or MGRiT that answer simple questions such as, (i) for a given\n$\\Phi$ and $k$, what is the best $\\Psi$, or (ii) can Parareal/MGRiT converge\nfor my problem? This work derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nconvergence of Parareal and MGRiT applied to linear problems, along with tight\ntwo-level convergence bounds. Results rest on the introduction of a \"temporal\napproximation property\" (TAP) that indicates how $\\Phi^k$ must approximate the\naction of $\\Psi$ on different vectors. Loosely, for unitarily diagonalizable\noperators, the TAP indicates that fine-grid and coarse-grid time integration\nschemes must integrate geometrically smooth spatial components similarly, and\nless so for geometrically high frequency. In the (non-unitarily) diagonalizable\nsetting, the conditioning of each eigenvector, $\\mathbf{v}_i$, must also be\nreflected in how well $\\Psi\\mathbf{v}_i \\sim\\Phi^k\\mathbf{v}_i$.

A\nfundamental difference brought about by $\\Lambda >0$, as compared to\n$\\Lambda<0$ is in the structure of the resulting space time. Associated with\neach of the two commuting Killing vectors $\\partial_{\\phi}$, and\n$\\partial_{z}$, there is a curvature singularity that has the same\ncharacteristics as that associated to $\\partial_{\\phi}$ in the Levi - Civita\nmetric, and we show that there is an isometry relating these singularities that\nreduces the effective parameter space of the metrics.

Latent spatial extremes models reduce\nuncertainty by exploiting spatial dependence in statistical characteristics of\nextreme events to borrow strength across locations. However, these estimates\ncan have poor properties due to model misspecification: many latent spatial\nextremes models do not account for extremal dependence, which is spatial\ndependence in the extreme events themselves. We improve estimates from latent\nspatial extremes models that make conditional independence assumptions by\nproposing a weighted likelihood that uses the extremal coefficient to\nincorporate information about extremal dependence during estimation. This\napproach differs from, and is simpler than, directly modeling the spatial\nextremal dependence; for example, by fitting a max-stable process, which is\nchallenging to fit to real, large datasets.

Scalability\nproblems led to the development of local graph clustering algorithms that come\nwith a variety of theoretical guarantees. Rather than return a global\nclustering of the entire graph, local clustering algorithms return a single\ncluster around a given seed node or set of seed nodes. These algorithms improve\nscalability because they use time and memory resources that depend only on the\nsize of the cluster returned, instead of the size of the input graph. Indeed,\nfor many of them, their running time grows linearly with the size of the\noutput. In addition to scalability arguments, local graph clustering algorithms\nhave proven to be very useful for identifying and interpreting small-scale and\nmeso-scale structure in large-scale graphs. As opposed to heuristic operational\nprocedures, this class of algorithms comes with strong algorithmic and\nstatistical theory.

Variation in free energy during micelle assembly is derived for the\nspecific case of AOT surfactant in isooctane solvent using atomistic molecular\ndynamics simulation analyzed using the energy representation method. The\nexistence and thermodynamic stability of dry reverse micelles of limited size\nare confirmed. The abrupt occurence of monodisperse aggregates is a clear\nsignature a critical micelle concentration, commonly observed in the formation\nof normal surfactant micelles. The morphology of large dry micelles provides\ninsight into the nature of the thermodynamic driving forces stabilizing the\nformation of the surfactant aggregates. Overall, this study provides detailed\ninsight into the structure and stability of dry reverse micelles assembly in\nnon-polar solvent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 01:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 04:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

Depending on neutrino beam\nenergies, quasi-elastic, resonance, Regge, or/and deep inelastic scattering\n(DIS) processes contribute to the neutrino cross section. It is desirable to\nhave a code to calculate the neutrino-nucleus cross section in any kinematical\nrange by combining various theoretical descriptions.

In that approach, a same constraint could be\nchecked several times when processing different minimal cycles, hence one may\nrequire additional recording mechanisms to avoid redundant computation in order\nto downgrade the time complexity to polynomial.\n  We present a new approach that does not need to process minimal cycles. It\nbased on a normal form that allows to define the validation conditions by\ntaking into account only the root-bud paths from the non-singleton strongly\nconnected components of its digraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 03:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

Moreover as F++ point out, the question is considerably more\nnuanced than the simple dichotomy it might appear to be at first sight.\n  This commentary is structured as follows. In Section 2 I briefly summarise\nthe arguments of F++ and comment on their approach. Next, in Section 3, I take\na step back to consider the nature of representativeness in inferential\narguments and the need for careful definition. Then I give three examples of\nusing different types of participant to consider impact. I conclude by arguing,\nlargely in agreement with F++, that the question of whether student\nparticipants are representative or not depends on the target population.\nHowever, we need to give careful consideration to defining that population and,\nin particular, not to overlook the representativeness of tasks and environment.\nThis is facilitated by explicit description of the target populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 05:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

However, training these models\noften relies on back-propagation through time, which entails unfolding the\nnetwork over many time steps, making the process of conducting credit\nassignment considerably more challenging. Furthermore, the nature of\nback-propagation itself does not permit the use of non-differentiable\nactivation functions and is inherently sequential, making parallelization of\nthe underlying training process difficult. Here, we propose the Parallel\nTemporal Neural Coding Network (P-TNCN), a biologically inspired model trained\nby the learning algorithm we call Local Representation Alignment. It aims to\nresolve the difficulties and problems that plague recurrent networks trained by\nback-propagation through time. The architecture requires neither unrolling in\ntime nor the derivatives of its internal activation functions. We compare our\nmodel and learning procedure to other back-propagation through time\nalternatives (which also tend to be computationally expensive), including\nreal-time recurrent learning, echo state networks, and unbiased online\nrecurrent optimization. We show that it outperforms these on sequence modeling\nbenchmarks such as Bouncing MNIST, a new benchmark we denote as Bouncing\nNotMNIST, and Penn Treebank. Notably, our approach can in some instances\noutperform full back-propagation through time as well as variants such as\nsparse attentive back-tracking. Significantly, the hidden unit correction phase\nof P-TNCN allows it to adapt to new datasets even if its synaptic weights are\nheld fixed (zero-shot adaptation) and facilitates retention of prior generative\nknowledge when faced with a task sequence. We present results that show the\nP-TNCN's ability to conduct zero-shot adaptation and online continual sequence\nmodeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 07:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 06:18:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 20:04:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 00:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In direct\nwater holding applications like water storage for plant water uptake, the main\ninterest is in micrometre-range porosity since these pores are able to store\nwater that is easily available for plants. Gas adsorption measurements which\nare commonly used to characterize the physical pore structure of biochars are\nnot able to quantify this pore-size range. While pyrogenetic porosity (i.e.\npores formed during pyrolysis process) tends to increase with elevated process\ntemperature, it is uncertain whether this change affects the pore space capable\nto store plant available water.

Thus, considering\nthe pore-size regime relevant to the storage of plant available water,\npyrolysis temperature in the studied range does not provide means to optimize\nthe biochar structure.

When the key-schedules are\nnon-linear, we prove security for 4 rounds. When only affine key-schedules are\nused, we prove security for 6 rounds. These also imply secure tweakable Feistel\nciphers in the Random Oracle model.\n  By shuffling the key-schedules, our model unifies both the DES-like structure\n(known as Feistel-2 scheme in the cryptanalytic community, a.k.a.\nkey-alternating Feistel due to Lampe and Seurin, FSE 2014) and the Lucifer-like\nmodel (previously analyzed by Guo and Lin, TCC 2015). This allows us to derive\nconcrete implications on these two (more common) models, and helps\nunderstanding their differences---and further understanding the related-key\nsecurity of Feistel ciphers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 08:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 06:36:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 16:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

While in multi-stage\nmethods, explicit decision rules (for example, affine decision rules) are\nusually adopted to guarantee nonanticipativity of ED decisions. With explicit\ndecision rules, the computational burden can be heavy and the optimality of the\nsolution is affected. In this paper, a multi-stage robust TCUC formulation with\nimplicit decision rules is proposed, as well as a decomposition framework to\nsolve it. The solutions are proved to be multi-stage robust and\nnonanticipativity of ED decisions is guaranteed. Meanwhile, a computationally\nefficient time-decoupled solution method for the feasibility check subproblems\nis also proposed such that the method is suitable for large-scale TCUC problems\nwith uncertain loads/renewable injections. Numerical tests are conducted on the\nIEEE 118-bus system and Polish 2383-bus system.

The analysis of the\nSpitzer and VVV photometric data depicts a group of infrared-excess sources\ntoward both the clumps, suggesting the ongoing SF activities. In each IRAS\nsite, high-resolution GMRT radio maps at 0.61 and 1.28 GHz confirm the presence\nof H II regions, which are powered by B-type stars. In the site IRAS\n17008-4040, a previously known O-star candidate without an H II region is\nidentified as an infrared counterpart of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission\n(i.e. IRcmme). Based on the VLT/NACO adaptive-optics L' image (resolution ~ 0.1\narcsec), the source IRcmme is resolved into two objects (i.e. IRcmme1 and\nIRcmme2) within a scale of 900 AU that are found to be associated with the ALMA\ncore G345.50M. IRcmme1 is characterized as the main accreting HMPO candidate\nbefore the onset of an ultracompact H II region. In the site IRAS 17009-4042,\nthe 1.28 GHz map has resolved two radio sources that were previously reported\nas a single radio peak. Altogether, in each IRAS site, the junction of the\nfilaments (i.e. massive clump) is investigated with the cluster of\ninfrared-excess sources and the ongoing massive SF.

Even in the\nabsence of turbulence, Poisson fluctuations of collision times in dilute\nsuspensions may result in substantial variations in the growth process,\nresulting in a broad distribution of growth times to reach a certain droplet\nsize. We quantify the accuracy of the superdroplet algorithm in describing the\nfluctuating growth history of a larger droplet that settles under the effect of\ngravity in a quiescent fluid and collides with a dilute suspension of smaller\ndroplets that were initially randomly distributed in space ('lucky droplet\nmodel'). We assess the effect of fluctuations upon the growth history of the\nlucky droplet and compute the distribution of cumulative collision times. The\nlatter is shown to be sensitive enough to detect the subtle increase of\nfluctuations associated with collisions between multiple lucky droplets. The\nsuperdroplet algorithm incorporates fluctuations in two distinct ways: through\nthe random spatial distribution of superdroplets and through the Monte Carlo\ncollision algorithm involved.

A new scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging\ntechnique is demonstrated that visualises the presence and strength of atomic\nmovements leading to a period doubling of the unit cell along the beam\ndirection, using the intensity in an extra Laue zone ring in the back focal\nplane recorded using a pixelated detector method. This method is used together\nwith conventional atomic resolution imaging in the plane perpendicular to the\nbeam direction to gain information about the 3D crystal structure in an\nepitaxial thin film of LaFeO3 sandwiched between a substrate of (111) SrTiO3\nand a top layer of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. It is found that a hitherto unreported\nstructure of LaFeO3 is formed under the unusual combination of compressive\nstrain and (111) growth, which is triclinic with a periodicity doubling from\nprimitive perovskite along one of the three <110> directions lying in the\ngrowth plane. This results from a combination of La-site modulation along the\nbeam direction, and modulation of oxygen positions resulting from octahedral\ntilting. This transition to the period-doubled cell is suppressed near both the\nsubstrate and near the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 top layer due to the clamping of the\noctahedral tilting by the absence of tilting in the substrate and due to an\nincompatible tilt pattern being present in the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 layer. This work\nshows a rapid and easy way of scanning for such transitions in thin films or\nother systems where disorder-order transitions or domain structures may be\npresent and does not require the use of atomic resolution imaging, and could be\ndone on any scanning TEM instrument equipped with a suitable camera.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 12:35:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 08:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Developers must carefully train or program systems for\nevery situation. General commonsense reasoning remains elusive. The absence of\ncommon sense prevents intelligent systems from understanding their world,\nbehaving reasonably in unforeseen situations, communicating naturally with\npeople, and learning from new experiences. Its absence is perhaps the most\nsignificant barrier between the narrowly focused AI applications we have today\nand the more general, human-like AI systems we would like to build in the\nfuture. Machine common sense remains a broad, potentially unbounded problem in\nAI. There are a wide range of strategies that could be employed to make\nprogress on this difficult challenge. This paper discusses two diverse\nstrategies for focusing development on two different machine commonsense\nservices: (1) a service that learns from experience, like a child, to construct\ncomputational models that mimic the core domains of child cognition for objects\n(intuitive physics), agents (intentional actors), and places (spatial\nnavigation); and (2) service that learns from reading the Web, like a research\nlibrarian, to construct a commonsense knowledge repository capable of answering\nnatural language and image-based questions about commonsense phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 13:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

The interaction\nof the DP, described by a broken $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry, with the SM is\nusually generated at the one-loop level via kinetic mixing through the\nexistence of portal matter (PM), here assumed to be fermionic, which carries\nboth a dark charge as well as a SM $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge. For theoretical\nconsistency, as well as for many phenomenological reasons, this PM must be\nvector-like with respect to the SM and dark gauge groups and, in particular, is\nshown to be allowed only to transform as vector-like copies of the usual SM\nfields. The dark Higgs that is responsible for the breaking of $U(1)_D$ can\nthen generate a mixing between the PM and SM fields with the same electric\ncharge thus altering the DP interactions with (at least some of) the SM fields\nand also providing a path for the PM fields to decay. In this paper we briefly\nexplore the phenomenology of some specific simple models of this PM including,\nfor the case where the PM is leptonic in nature, their potential impact on\nexperiments probing low energy parity-violation and the g-2 of the muon. In the\ncase of color-triplet, bottom quark-like PM, their direct pair- and\nsingle-production at the LHC is shown to be observable in final states that\ninclude missing $E_T$ and/or very highly boosted lepton-jets together with\npairs of high $p_T$ b-jets that can be used to trigger on such events. These\nsignatures are quite distinct from those usually employed in the search for\nvector-like quarks at the LHC and, furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nconventional signal channels for vector-like quarks involving the SM Higgs and\ngauge fields are essentially closed in the case of PM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 13:33:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 15:05:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 15:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

We also present new results using Belief\nPropagation, which consists in solving the self-consistent recursion relations\nfor the Green's functions directly on a given sample. This allows us to\nnumerically study very large system sizes and to directly access observables\nrelated to the eigenfunctions and energy level statistics. In agreement with\nrecent works, we establish the existence of a delocalized non-ergodic phase on\nCayley trees. On random regular graphs instead our results indicate that\nergodicity is recovered when the system size is larger than a cross-over scale\n$N_c (W)$, which diverges exponentially fast approaching the localization\ntransition. This scale corresponds to the size at which the mean-level spacing\nbecomes smaller than the Thouless energy $E_{Th} (W)$. Such energy scale, which\nvanishes exponentially fast approaching the localization transition, is the one\nbelow which ergodicity in the level statistics is restored in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Remarkably, the behavior of random regular graphs below $N_c (W)$\ncoincides with the one found close to the root of loop-less infinite Cayley\ntrees, {\\it i.e.} only above $N_c (W)$ the effects of loops emerge and random\nregular graphs behave differently from Cayley trees. Our results indicate that\nergodicity is recovered in the thermodynamic limit on random regular graph.\nHowever, all observables probing volumes smaller than $N_c(W)$ and times\nsmaller than $\\hbar/E_{Th} (W)$ are expected to behave as if there were an\nintermediate phase. Given the very fast divergence of $N_c(W)$ and\n$\\hbar/E_{Th} (W)$ these non-ergodic effects are very pronounced in a large\nregion preceding the localization transition, and they can be related to the\nintermediate phase present on Cayley trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 13:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

In contrast to spontaneous emission of\nradiation from a random electron beam that is proportional to the number of\nparticles, a pre-bunched electron beam can emit spontaneously coherent\nradiation proportional to the number of particles - squared, through the\nprocess of (spontaneous) superradiance (SP-SR) (in the sense of Dicke's). The\ncoherent SP-SR emission of a bunched electron beam can be even further enhanced\nby a process of stimulated-superradiance (ST-SR) in the presence of a seed\ninjected radiation field. In this review, these coherent radiation emission\nprocesses for both single bunch and periodically bunched beams are considered\nin a model of radiation mode expansion.\n  The general model of coherent spontaneous emission is extended to the\nnonlinear regime, particularly for undulator (wiggler) interaction:\nTapering-Enhanced Stimulated Superradiant Amplification (TESSA).\n  Processes of SP-SR and TESSA take place in tapered wiggler seed-injected\nFELs. In such FELs, operating in the X-Ray regime, these processes are\nconvoluted with other effects.

This assumption neglects important information\ncarried by inter-personal social ties such as genetic similarity, geographic\nproximity, and social closeness, which may crucially affect the outcome of\ninteractions. To model these situations, we present a framework of evolutionary\nmultiplayer games on graphs with edge diversity, where different types of edges\ndescribe diverse social ties.

They are\nan older class of SNRs, and as such are profoundly affected by the environment\ninto which they evolve. VRO 42.05.01 is a MM SNR of puzzling morphology in the\ndirection of the Galactic anticentre. Low-frequency radio observations of\nsupernova remnants are sensitive to synchrotron electrons accelerated in the\nshock front. We aim to compare the low-frequency emission to higher frequency\nobservations to understand the environmental and shock acceleration conditions\nthat have given rise to the observed properties of this source. We present a\nLOFAR High Band Antenna map centred at 143 MHz of the region of the Galactic\nplane centred at $l = 166^\\rm{o}, b = 3.5^\\rm{o}$ at 143 MHz, with a resolution\nof 148'' and an rms noise of 4.4 mJy bm$^{-1}$ . Our map is sensitive to scales\nas large as $6^\\rm{o}$. We compared the LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR) observations\nto archival higher frequency radio, infrared, and optical data to study the\nemission properties of the source in different spectral regimes. We did this\nboth for the SNR and for OA 184, an H II region within our field of view. We\nfind that the radio spectral index of VRO 42.05.01 increases at low radio\nfrequencies; i.e. the LOFAR flux is higher than expected from the measured\nspectral index value at higher radio frequencies. This observed curvature in\nthe low-frequency end of the radio spectrum occurs primarily in the brightest\nregions of the source, while the fainter regions present a roughly constant\npower-law behaviour between 143 MHz and 2695 MHz. We favour an explanation for\nthis steepening whereby radiative shocks have high compression ratios and\nelectrons of different energies probe different length scales across the\nshocks, therefore sampling regions of different compression ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 14:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

To estimate the critical exponents, various methods\nhave been adopted like; the modified Arrott plots (MAP), the Kouvel-Fisher\nmethod (KF) and the critical isotherm analysis. This material shows a second\norder type a paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition around\n160 K. The critical exponents obtained from modified Arrott plots are $\\beta$ =\n0.531, $\\gamma$ = 0.935 and $T_c$ = 160 K. Kouvel-Fisher method gives the\nexponents as $\\beta$ = 0.533$\\pm$0.001 with $T_c$ = 160.72$\\pm$0.03 K and\n$\\gamma$ = 0.932$\\pm$0.003 with $T_c$ = 160.15$\\pm$0.05 K. The third exponent\n$\\delta$ = 2.763$\\pm$0.005 obtained from critical isothermal is in agreement\nwith Wisdom scaling rule. The estimated critical exponents do not exactly match\nwith any established universality class, however, the deduced exponent values\nsuggest that spin interaction in the present material is close to mean-field\nmodel which suggests the existence of long-range ferromagnetic order in\nnano-crystalline Pr$_2$CoMnO$_6$. The reliability of critical exponents is\nchecked by universal scaling hypothesis on magnetic data across T$_c$.

To handle these problems, recent approaches have\nproposed pruning strategies that find and remove unimportant neurons (i.e.,\nfilters) in these networks. Despite achieving remarkable results, existing\npruning approaches are ineffective since the accuracy of the original network\nis degraded. In this work, we propose a novel approach to efficiently remove\nfilters from convolutional networks. Our approach estimates the filter\nimportance based on its relationship with the class label on a low-dimensional\nspace. This relationship is computed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and\nVariable Importance in Projection (VIP). Our method is able to reduce up to 67%\nof the floating point operations (FLOPs) without penalizing the network\naccuracy. With a negligible drop in accuracy, we can reduce up to 90% of FLOPs.\nAdditionally, sometimes the method is even able to improve the accuracy\ncompared to original, unpruned, network. We show that employing PLS+VIP as the\ncriterion for detecting the filters to be removed is better than recent feature\nselection techniques, which have been employed by state-of-the-art pruning\nmethods. Finally, we show that the proposed method achieves the highest FLOPs\nreduction and the smallest drop in accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art\npruning approaches.

Field-trapping mitigates\nthe problem of UCN loss on material surfaces, which caused the largest\ncorrection in prior neutron experiments using material bottles. However, the\nneutron dynamics in field traps differ qualitatively from those in material\nbottles. In the latter case, neutrons bounce off material surfaces with\nsignificant diffusivity and the population quickly reaches a static spatial\ndistribution with a density gradient induced by the gravitational potential. In\ncontrast, the field-confined UCN -- whose dynamics can be described by\nHamiltonian mechanics -- do not exhibit the stochastic behaviors typical of an\nideal gas model as observed in material bottles. In this report, we will\ndescribe our efforts to simulate UCN trapping in the UCN{\\tau}\nmagneto-gravitational trap. We compare the simulation output to the\nexperimental results to determine the parameters of the neutron detector and\nthe input neutron distribution. The tuned model is then used to understand the\nphase space evolution of neutrons observed in the UCN{\\tau} experiment. We will\ndiscuss the implications of chaotic dynamics on controlling the systematic\neffects, such as spectral cleaning and microphonic heating, for a successful\nUCN lifetime experiment to reach a 0.01% level of precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 18:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

In the absence of strong\nmagnetic fields, the core convective flows are expected to be in a regime of\nrapidly-rotating turbulence, which remains largely unexplored to date.

In particular, the appearance and the shape of the input face, or the\nrepresentations of some face parts, are commonly used to boost the quality of\nthe recognizer. This paper investigates the application of Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) with the aim of building a versatile recognizer of expressions\nin static images that can be further applied to video sequences. We first study\nthe importance of different face parts in the recognition task, focussing on\nappearance and shape-related features. Then we cast the learning problem in the\nSemi-Supervised setting, exploiting video data, where only a few frames are\nsupervised. The unsupervised portion of the training data is used to enforce\nthree types of coherence, namely temporal coherence, coherence among the\npredictions on the face parts and coherence between appearance and shape-based\nrepresentation.
