The progenitor adopted from stellar evolution calculations\nincluding magnetic fields had a fairly low specific angular momentum (j_Fe <~\n10^{15} cm^2/s) in the iron core (central angular velocity ~0.2 rad/s), which\nwe compared to simulations without rotation and with artificially enhanced\nrotation (j_Fe <~ 2*10^{16} cm^2/s; central angular velocity ~0.5 rad/s). Our\nresults confirm that the time-domain GW signals of SNe are stochastic, but\npossess deterministic components with characteristic patterns at low\nfrequencies (<~200 Hz), caused by mass motions due to the standing accretion\nshock instability (SASI), and at high frequencies, associated with gravity-mode\noscillations in the surface layer of the proto-neutron star (PNS). Non-radial\nmass motions in the post-shock layer as well as PNS convection are important\ntriggers of GW emission, whose amplitude scales with the power of the\nhydrodynamic flows. There is no monotonic increase of the GW amplitude with\nrotation, but a clear correlation with the strength of SASI activity. Our\nslowly rotating model is a fainter GW emitter than the non-rotating model\nbecause of weaker SASI activity and damped convection in the post-shock layer\nand PNS. In contrast, the faster rotating model exhibits a powerful SASI spiral\nmode during its transition to explosion, producing the highest GW amplitudes\nwith a distinctive drift of the low-frequency emission peak from ~80-100 Hz to\n~40-50 Hz. This migration signifies shock expansion, whereas non-exploding\nmodels are discriminated by the opposite trend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 16:00:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 15:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

In such lattice\nmodels, the effects of inter-particle interactions generally lead to a breaking\nof the cages, and hence, to the spreading of the wavefunction over the lattice.\nMotivated by recent experimental realizations of analog Aharonov-Bohm cages for\nlight, using coupled-waveguide arrays, we hereby demonstrate that caging always\noccurs in the presence of local nonlinearities. As a central result, we focus\non special caged solutions, which are accompanied by a breathing motion of the\nfield intensity, that we describe in terms of an effective two-mode model\nreminiscent of a bosonic Josephson junction.

The\nWSO-UV is aimed to operate in the 115-310 nm UV spectral range. Its two major\nscience instruments are UV spectrographs and a UV imaging field camera with\nfilter wheels. The WSO-UV project is currently in the implementation phase,\nwith a tentative launch date in 2023. Recently, two additional instruments\ndevoted to exoplanets have been proposed for WSO-UV, which are the focus of\nthis paper. UVSPEX, a UV-Spectrograph for Exoplanets, aims to determine atomic\nhydrogen and oxygen abundance in the exospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. The\nspectral range is 115-130 nm which enables simultaneous measurement of hydrogen\nand oxygen emission intensities during an exoplanet transit. Study of exosphere\ntransit photometric curves can help differentiate among different types of\nrocky planets. The exospheric temperature of an Earth-like planet is much\nhigher than that of a Venus-like planet, because of the low mixing ratio of the\ndominant coolant (CO2) in the upper atmosphere of the former, which causes a\nlarge difference in transit depth at the oxygen emission line. Thus, whether\nthe terrestrial exoplanet is Earth-like, Venus-like, or other can be\ndetermined. SCEDI, a Stellar Coronagraph for Exoplanet Direct Imaging is aimed\nto directly detect the starlight reflected from exoplanets orbiting their\nparent stars or from the stellar vicinity including circumstellar discs, dust,\nand clumps. SCEDI will create an achromatic (optimized to 420-700 nm wavelength\nrange), high-contrast stellocentric coronagraphic image of a circumstellar\nvicinity.

Here we examine\nCEP-sensitive photoemission from plasmonic gold nanoantennas excited with\nfew-cycle optical pulses of increasing energy.

The results show that the lobed geometry changes both the\nconvection velocity and temporal growth rate of the instability waves. However,\ndifferent modes are affected differently.

Unfortunately,\naliasing artifacts arising from signals beyond the principle measurement depth\nof the free spectral range have prohibited the use of a FC FDML for imaging so\nfar. To make the enhanced coherence length of FC FDML laser available, methods\nto manage such artifacts are required.

Our study therefore\nestablishes a firm link between the excess of radially anisotropic stellar\ndebris in the Milky Way halo and an ancient head-on collision between the young\nMilky Way and a massive dwarf galaxy\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 20:29:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 09:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

An important issue in such systems is to determine the server to\nwhich an incoming request should be routed to optimize a given performance\ncriteria. In this paper, we assume the server's scheduling disciplines to be\nheterogeneous. More precisely, a server implements a scheduling discipline\nwhich belongs to the class of limited processor sharing (LPS-$d$) scheduling\ndisciplines. Under LPS-$d$, up to $d$ jobs can be served simultaneously, and\nhence, includes as special cases First Come First Served ($d=1$) and Processor\nSharing ($d=\\infty$).\n  In order to obtain efficient heuristics, we model the above load-balancing\nframework as a multi-armed restless bandit problem. Using the relaxation\ntechnique, as first developed in the seminal work of Whittle, we derive\nWhittle's index policy for general cost functions and obtain a closed-form\nexpression for Whittle's index in terms of the steady-state distribution.\nThrough numerical computations, we investigate the performance of Whittle's\nindex with two different performance criteria: linear cost criterion and a cost\ncriterion that depends on the first and second moment of the throughput. Our\nresults show that \\emph{(i)} the structure of Whittle's index policy can\nstrongly depend on the scheduling discipline implemented in the server, i.e.,\non $d$, and that \\emph{(ii)} Whittle's index policy significantly outperforms\nstandard dispatching rules such as Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ), Join the\nShortest Expected Workload (JSEW), and Random Server allocation (RSA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 20:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

As a result, all\nof the sequences have the same error relative to the ideal gate under any\ndistance measure that is invariant under unitary transformations.

The results point to\nthe utility of both minimizing the error and optimizing the error direction and\nalso to the advantages of using multiple control sequences for the same gate\ntype within a single algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 21:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Here we\nreport a relationship between the zero-temperature phase boundary residual\nentropy (critical residual entropy) and pseudo-transition. Usually, the\nresidual entropy increases in the phase boundary, which means the system\nbecomes more degenerate at the phase boundary compared to its adjacent states.\nHowever, this is not always the case; at zero temperature, there are some phase\nboundaries where the entropy holds the largest residual entropy of the adjacent\nstates. Therefore, we can propose the following conjecture: If residual entropy\nat zero-temperature is a continuous function at least from the one-sided limit\nat a critical point, then pseudo-transition evidence will appear at finite\ntemperature near the critical point. We expect that this argument would apply\nto study more realistic models.

Traditionally, matched\nfiltering techniques are used to identify gravitational-wave signals, but we\ninstead aim to utilize machine learning techniques to achieve this. In this\nwork, we implement supervised machine learning classifiers (support vector\nmachine, random forest, multi-layer perceptron) to discriminate such lensing\npatterns in gravitational wave data.

By using bio-inspired foraging methods such as multi-place\nforaging and stigmergy-based navigation, a swarm of robots is able to improve\nthe efficiency and autonomy of the urban waste management system in a realistic\nscenario. To achieve this, a diverse set of simulation experiments was\nconducted using real-world GIS data and implementing different garbage\ncollection scenarios driven by robot swarms. Results presented in this research\nshow that the proposed system outperforms current approaches.

Despite such progress, these models often face\nchallenges in real world `wild tasks' where large difference between labeled\ntraining/source data and unseen test/target data exists. In particular, such\ndifference is often referred to as `domain gap', and could cause significantly\ndecreased performance which cannot be easily remedied by further increasing the\nrepresentation power. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) seeks to overcome\nsuch problem without target domain labels. In this paper, we propose a novel\nUDA framework based on an iterative self-training procedure, where the problem\nis formulated as latent variable loss minimization, and can be solved by\nalternatively generating pseudo labels on target data and re-training the model\nwith these labels. On top of self-training, we also propose a novel\nclass-balanced self-training framework to avoid the gradual dominance of large\nclasses on pseudo-label generation, and introduce spatial priors to refine\ngenerated labels.

Ways to bypass this problem\nhave focused on inhomogeneities in the flow, be that zonal flows, streaming\ninstability, or vortices. Because vortices are in equilibrium between the\nCoriolis and the pressure force, the pressureless grains will orbit along a\nvortex streamline experiencing a drag force. This is a very effective mechanism\nto concentrate pebbles as also seen in numerical simulations and possibly in\nALMA observations. Yet, a high pebble load is dangerous for the vortex, and we\nshowed that in two-dimensional simulations the backreaction eventually leads to\nvortex disruption. We investigate whether the same happens in three dimensions.\nWe perform 3D simulations with pebbles in a local box finding that, although\nthe pebbles disturb the vortex around the midplane, the column does not get\ndestroyed. This result is important because, based on the previous 2D result\nsuggesting complete disruption, the vortex interpretation of ALMA observations\nhas been called into question. We show instead that the vortex behaves like a\nTaylor column, and the pebbles as obstacles to the flow.

The field strength\nexhibits two regimes: 1) for fast rotation it is independent of Ro, 2) for slow\nrotation it decays with Ro following a power law. For the magnetic cycle period\ntwo regimes of activity, the active and inactive branches, also have been\nidentified. For both of them, the longer the rotation period, the longer the\nactivity cycle. Using global dynamo simulations of solar like stars with Rossby\nnumbers between ~0.4 and ~2, this paper explores the relevance of rotational\nshear layers in determining these observational properties. Our results,\nconsistent with non-linear alpha^2-Omega dynamos, show that the total magnetic\nfield strength is independent of the rotation period.

Surface-curve intersection\nis required in a wide range of applications, including contact, immersed\nboundary methods and lattice-skin structures, and requires usually the solution\nof a system of nonlinear equations. It is assumed that the surface is given in\nform of a spline, such as a NURBS, T-spline or Catmull-Clark subdivision\nsurface, and is convertible into a collection of B\\'ezier patches.

Two qualitatively different modes of fast adaptation have been\nproposed: selective sweeps wherein large shifts in the allele frequencies occur\nat a few loci and evolution via small changes in the allele frequencies at many\nloci. While the first process has been thoroughly investigated within the\nframework of population genetics, the latter is based on quantitative genetics\nand is much less understood. Here we summarize results from our recent\ntheoretical studies of a quantitative genetic model of polygenic adaptation\nthat makes explicit reference to population genetics to bridge the gap between\nthe two frameworks. Our key results are that polygenic adaptation may be a\nrapid process and can proceed via subtle or dramatic changes in the allele\nfrequency depending on the sizes of the phenotypic effects relative to a\nthreshold value. We also discuss how the signals of polygenic selection may be\ndetected in the genome. While powerful methods are available to identify\nsignatures of selective sweeps at loci controling quantitative traits, the\ndevelopment of statistical tests for detecting small shifts of allele\nfrequencies at quantitative trait loci is still in its infancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 10:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

Here, using a multitype\nbranching process, we obtain an accurate analytical expression for the fixation\nprobability when deleterious effects are weak, and exploit this result along\nwith the clonal interference theory to investigate the joint effect of linked\nbeneficial and deleterious mutations on the rate of adaptation. We find that\nwhen the mutation rate is increased beyond the beneficial fitness effect, the\nfixation probability of the beneficial mutant decreases from Haldane's\nclassical result towards zero. This has the consequence that above a critical\nmutation rate that may depend on the population size, the adaptation rate\ndecreases exponentially with the mutation rate and is independent of the\npopulation size. In addition, we find that for a range of mutation rates, both\nbeneficial and deleterious mutations interfere and impede the adaptation\nprocess in large populations. We also study the evolution of mutation rates in\nadapting asexual populations, and conclude that linked beneficial mutations\nhave a stronger influence on mutator fixation than the deleterious mutations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 10:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

They have unique physical, chemical and mechanical properties, which are\nvery different from those of large scale materials. This uniqueness is\nattributed to the fact that the number of atoms in the surface layer and in the\nbulk is commensurable. As the atoms in the surface layer of nanoparticles have\ntheir counterparts from one side only, their balance is impaired, and the\nresulting structure relaxation leads to the displacement of atomic spacing in a\n2-3nm layer. Therefore the surface layers expand while internal layers\ncompressed, as these are exposed to an excessive Laplace pressure of up to\nhundreds kilobars. Nanoparticles have a highly distorted lattice that has an\neffect on activation energy of most of the processes they are involved in, by\nchanging their nature and sequence.

An intriguing aspect of Type II radio bursts is the\noccasional split of a harmonic band into thinner lanes, known as\nband-splitting. Here, we report a detailed imaging and spectroscopic\nobservation of a CME-driven shock producing band-splitting in a Type II burst.\nUsing the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), we examine the spatial and temporal\nrelation of the Type II burst to the associated CME event, use source imaging\nto calculate the apparent coronal density, and demonstrate how source imaging\ncan be used to estimate projection effects.

Most\nof these devices are expected to be of low-complexity, low-cost, and limited\npower supply, which impose stringent constraints on the network operation. In\nthis regard, this paper investigates aerial data aggregation and field\nestimation from a finite spatial field via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nInstead of fusing, relaying, and routing the data across the wireless nodes to\nfixed locations access points, a UAV flies over the field and collects the\nrequired data for two prominent missions; data aggregation and field\nestimation. To accomplish these tasks, the field of interest is divided into\nseveral subregions over which the UAV hovers to collect samples from the\nunderlying nodes. To this end, we formulate and solve an optimization problem\nto minimize total hovering and traveling time of each mission. While the former\nrequires the collection of a prescribed average number of samples from the\nfield, the latter ensures for a given field spatial correlation model that the\naverage mean-squared estimation error of the field value is no more than a\npredetermined threshold at any point. These goals are fulfilled by optimizing\nthe number of subregions, the area of each subregion, the hovering locations,\nthe hovering time at each location, and the trajectory traversed between\nhovering locations. The proposed formulation is shown to be np-hard mixed\ninteger problem, and hence, a decoupled heuristic solution is proposed. The\nresults show that there exists an optimal number of subregions that balance the\ntradeoff between hovering and traveling times such that the total time for\ncollecting the required samples is minimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 13:22:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 03:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-03"}

For this purpose a 2D semi-discrete model is proposed in this paper.\nIt consists of two distinct phases, each with its specific material properties,\nseparated by a fully coherent and non-damaging phase boundary. Each phase is\nmodelled as a continuum enriched with a Peierls--Nabarro (PN) dislocation\nregion, confining dislocation motion to a discrete plane, the glide plane. In\nthis paper, a single glide plane perpendicular to and continuous across the\nphase boundary is considered. Along the glide plane bulk induced shear\ntractions are balanced by glide plane shear tractions based on the classical PN\nmodel. The model's ability to capture dislocation obstruction at phase\nboundaries, dislocation pile-ups and dislocation transmission is studied.\nResults show that the phase contrast in material properties (e.g. elastic\nstiffness, glide plane properties) alone creates a barrier to the motion of\ndislocations from a soft to a hard phase. The proposed model accounts for the\ninterplay between dislocations, external boundaries and phase boundary and thus\nrepresents a suitable tool for studying edge dislocation--phase boundary\ninteraction in two-phase microstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 13:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Biconvexity is a natural notion with some useful applications in\noptimization theory. It has also be independently used, under the name of\n\"rectilinear convexity\", in computational geometry. We are concerned here with\nthe problem of asymptotically reconstructing (or estimating) a biconvex set $S$\nfrom a random sample of points drawn on $S$. By analogy with the classical\nconvex case, one would like to define the \"biconvex hull\" of the sample points\nas a natural estimator for $S$. However, as previously pointed out by several\nauthors, the notion of \"hull\" for a given set $A$ (understood as the \"minimal\"\nset including $A$ and having the required property) has no obvious, useful\ntranslation to the biconvex case. This is in sharp contrast with the well-known\nelementary definition of convex hull. Thus, we have selected the most commonly\naccepted notion of \"biconvex hull\" (often called \"rectilinear convex hull\"): we\nfirst provide additional motivations for this definition, proving some useful\nrelations with other convexity-related notions.

Such problems are typically\nconsidered to be of an on-line nature, in that the input is unknown to the\nsearcher, and the performance of a search strategy is usually analyzed by means\nof the standard framework of the competitive ratio, which compares the cost\nincurred by the searcher to an optimal strategy that knows the location of the\ntarget. However, one can argue that even for simple search problems,\ncompetitive analysis fails to distinguish between strategies which,\nintuitively, should have different performance in practice.\n  Motivated by the above, in this work we introduce and study measures\nsupplementary to competitive analysis in the context of search problems. In\nparticular, we focus on the well-known problem of linear search, informally\nknown as the cow-path problem, for which there is an infinite number of\nstrategies that achieve an optimal competitive ratio equal to 9. We propose a\nmeasure that reflects the rate at which the line is being explored by the\nsearcher, and which can be seen as an extension of the bijective ratio over an\nuncountable set of requests. Using this measure we show that a natural strategy\nthat explores the line aggressively is optimal among all 9-competitive\nstrategies. This provides, in particular, a strict separation from the\ncompetitively optimal doubling strategy, which is much more conservative in\nterms of exploration. We also provide evidence that this aggressiveness is\nrequisite for optimality, by showing that any optimal strategy must mimic the\naggressive strategy in its first few explorations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 15:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-19"}

The combination of a centrally managed fleet of\ndriverless vehicles, along with the operating characteristics of electric\nvehicles, is creating a transformative new technology that offers significant\ncost savings with high service levels. This problem involves a dispatch problem\nfor assigning riders to cars, a surge pricing problem for deciding on the price\nper trip and a planning problem for deciding on the fleet size. We use\napproximate dynamic programming to develop high-quality operational dispatch\nstrategies to determine which car is best for a particular trip, when a car\nshould be recharged, and when it should be re-positioned to a different zone\nwhich offers a higher density of trips.

In this paper, we\npropose a knowledge transfer adversarial network to better train a student\nnetwork.

To transfer the knowledge\nof intermediate representations, we set high-level teacher feature maps as a\ntarget, toward which the student feature maps are trained.

The intermediate representation helps the student\nnetwork better understand the transferred generalization as compared to the\nprobability distribution only. Furthermore, we infuse an adversarial learning\nprocess by employing a discriminator network, which can fully exploit the\nspatial correlation of feature maps in training a student network.

Despite longstanding\nefforts, however, experimental understanding of this system has not been\nsettled yet. One of the reasons is that most semiconductors hosting\nhigh-mobility two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) usually form Schottky\nbarriers at the metal contacts, preventing efficient proximity between the\nquantum Hall edge states and Cooper pairs. Only recently have relatively\ntransparent 2DES/superconductor junctions been investigated in graphene. In\nthis study, we propose another material system for investigating\n2DES/superconductor junctions, that is ZnO-based heterostrcuture. Due to the\nionic nature of ZnO, a Schottky barrier is not effectively formed at the\ncontact with a superconductor MoGe, as evidenced by the appearance of Andreev\nreflection at low temperatures. With applying magnetic field, while clear\nquantum Hall effect is observed for ZnO 2DES, conductance across the junction\noscillates with the filling factor of the quantum Hall states. We find that\nAndreev reflection is suppressed in the well developed quantum Hall regimes,\nwhich we interpret as a result of equal probabilities of normal and Andreev\nreflections as a result of multiple Andreev reflection at the\n2DES/superconductor interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 01:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

Here, we show the steps needed for implementing this\nmodel on an optical problem. We investigated the colour generation by\ndielectric nanostructures and show that this model can find geometrical\nproperties that can generate a much deeper red, green and blue colours compared\nto the ones found by human researchers. This technique can easily be extended\nto predict and find the best design parameters for other optical structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 03:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

For\neach patient in the queue, the total treatment time of all patients before him\nis the time that he must wait. It would be convenient and preferable if the\npatients could receive the most efficient treatment plan and know the predicted\nwaiting time through a mobile application that updates in real-time. Therefore,\nwe propose a Patient Treatment Time Prediction (PTTP) algorithm to predict the\nwaiting time for each treatment task for a patient. We use realistic patient\ndata from various hospitals to obtain a patient treatment time model for each\ntask. Based on this large-scale, realistic dataset, the treatment time for each\npatient in the current queue of each task is predicted. Based on the predicted\nwaiting time, a Hospital Queuing-Recommendation (HQR) system is developed. HQR\ncalculates and predicts an efficient and convenient treatment plan recommended\nfor the patient. Because of the large-scale, realistic dataset and the\nrequirement for real-time response, the PTTP algorithm and HQR system mandate\nefficiency and low-latency response. We use an Apache Spark-based cloud\nimplementation at the National Supercomputing Center in Changsha (NSCC) to\nachieve the aforementioned goals. Extensive experimentation and simulation\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed model\nto recommend an effective treatment plan for patients to minimize their wait\ntimes in hospitals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 19:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

It is\ncritical to integrate multiple data resources to identify reliable protein\ncommunities that have biological significance and improve the performance of\ncommunity detection methods for large-scale PPI networks. In this paper, we\npropose a Multi-source Learning based Protein Community Detection (MLPCD)\nalgorithm by integrating Gene Expression Data (GED) and a parallel solution of\nMLPCD using cloud computing technology. To effectively discover the biological\nfunctions of proteins that participating in different cellular processes, GED\nunder different conditions is integrated with the original PPI network to\nreconstruct a Weighted-PPI (WPPI) network. To flexibly identify protein\ncommunities of different scales, we define community modularity and functional\ncohesion measurements and detect protein communities from WPPI using an\nagglomerative method. In addition, we respectively compare the detected\ncommunities with known protein complexes and evaluate the functional enrichment\nof protein function modules using Gene Ontology annotations. Moreover, we\nimplement a parallel version of the MLPCD algorithm on the Apache Spark\nplatform to enhance the performance of the algorithm for large-scale realistic\nPPI networks.

The\nregular GWAS method suffers from a substantial multiple-testing burden because\nof the millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being tested\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, it does not consider the functional genetic effect\non the response variable; i.e., it ignores more complex joint effects of nearby\nSNPs within a region. Our proposed method screens the entire genome for\nassociations using a sequential sliding-window approach based on wavelets. A\nsequence of SNPs represents a genetic signal, and for every screened region, we\ntransform the genetic signal into the wavelet space. We then estimate the\nproportion of wavelet coefficients associated with the phenotype at different\nscales. The significance of a region is assessed via simulations, taking\nadvantage of a recent result on Bayes factor distributions. Our new approach\nreduces the number of independent tests to be performed. Moreover, we show via\nsimulations that the Wavelet Screaming method provides a substantial gain in\npower compared to the classic GWAS modeling when faced with more complex\nsignals than just single-SNP associations.
