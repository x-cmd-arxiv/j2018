Specifically, unmeasured covariates whose lack of inclusion in the\nmodel would lead to biased, inefficient results are commonly modelled by\nincluding a subject-specific (or cluster-specific) frailty term that follows a\ngiven distribution (e.g. Gamma or log-Normal). Despite that, in the context of\nparametric frailty models little is known about the impact of misspecifying the\nbaseline hazard, the frailty distribution, or both. Therefore, our aim is to\nquantify the impact of such misspecification in a wide variety of clinically\nplausible scenarios via Monte Carlo simulation, using open source software\nreadily available to applied researchers. We generate clustered survival data\nassuming various baseline hazard functions, including mixture distributions\nwith turning points, and assess the impact of sample size, variance of the\nfrailty, baseline hazard function, and frailty distribution. Models compared\ninclude standard parametric distributions and more flexible spline-based\napproaches; we also included semiparametric Cox models. The resulting bias can\nbe clinically relevant.

Although central estimates of 21st century\nglobal-mean SLR have been relatively consistent, the range of projected SLR has\nvaried greatly over time. Among studies providing multiple estimates, the range\nof upper projections shrank from 1.3 to 1.8 m during the 1980s to 0.6 to 0.9 m\nin 2007, before expanding again to 0.5 to 2.5 m since 2013. Upper projections\nof SLR from individual studies are generally higher than upper projections from\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, potentially due to differing\npercentile bounds, or a pre-disposition of consensus-based approaches toward\nrelatively conservative outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 16:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

Here, we collate and summarise the current status of our\nknowledge of the substructures in the stellar halo of M31, and discuss\nconnections between these features. We estimate that the 13 most distinctive\nsubstructures were produced by at least 5 different accretion events, all in\nthe last 3 or 4 Gyrs. We suggest that a few of the substructures furthest from\nM31 may be shells from a single accretion event. We calculate the luminosities\nof some prominent substructures for which previous estimates were not\navailable, and we estimate the stellar mass budget of the outer halo of M31. We\nrevisit the problem of quantifying the properties of a highly structured\ndataset; specifically, we use the OPTICS clustering algorithm to quantify the\nhierarchical structure of M31's stellar halo, and identify three new faint\nstructures.

As a consequence, the theoretical error is now starting to\nlag behind the experimental one, and a ceaseless effort is required to reduce\nthe theory uncertainty to match the precision of the data. At hadron colliders,\nQCD predictions are obtained by convoluting perturbative parton-level results\nwith non-perturbative PDFs, whose precise determination is crucial to reach\npercent-accurate theoretical predictions. At the parton level, cross sections\nare obtained through a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling. In some\ncases, large terms appear at all orders and spoil the convergence of the\nseries. The perturbative description is rescued by resumming the series to all\norders, thereby making theory calculations accurate in regions where a\nfixed-order treatment is not sufficient. In this thesis I first present two\nglobal PDF sets where fixed-order calculations are supplemented by threshold\nand high-energy resummation, respectively. In the first case, it is found that\nincluding resummation into PDFs can compensate for the enhancement in the\npartonic cross sections, with implications for high-mass resonance searches. In\nthe second case, resummation quantitatively improves the description of the\nHERA structure functions, thus providing evidence of the onset of a new\ndynamical regime of QCD in the HERA data. I then focus on Higgs production in\ngluon fusion. The effect of threshold resummation on the total cross section is\nfound to significantly improve the convergence of the perturbative series and\nto provide a robust method for estimating missing higher order uncertainty.\nFinally, I present predictions for the Higgs transverse-momentum spectrum both\nin the inclusive case and within fiducial cuts, exploiting a novel approach\nwhere transverse-momentum resummation is performed in direct space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 19:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}

Using this representation, we\nextend the definition of two popular classes of causal estimands, marginal and\naverage causal effects, to the case of network interference. We characterize\nthe bias and variance one incurs when combining classical randomization\nstrategies (namely, Bernoulli, Completely Randomized, and Cluster Randomized\ndesigns) and estimators (namely, difference-in-means and Horvitz-Thompson) used\nto estimate average treatment effect and on the total treatment effect, under\nmisspecification due to interference.

The strongest evidence for\nlong-timescale pulse profile changes is seen in PSRs B1937+21 and J1643-1224.\nWe have focused our analyses on these four pulsars in an attempt to elucidate\nthe causes of their profile variability. Effects of scintillation seem to be\nresponsible for the profile modifications of PSR J2145-0750. We see evidence\nthat imperfect polarization calibration contributes to the profile variability\nof PSRs J1713+0747 and B1937+21, along with radio frequency interference around\n2 GHz, but find that propagation effects also have an influence. The changes\nseen in PSR J1643-1224 have been reported previously, yet elude explanation\nbeyond their astrophysical nature. Regardless of cause, unmodeled pulse profile\nchanges are detrimental to the accuracy of pulsar timing and must be\nincorporated into the timing models where possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 20:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 00:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Estimating the channel parameters in a computationally efficient\nmanner poses a challenge because it requires estimation of parameters from a\nhigh-dimensional measurement -- particularly for multi-carrier systems since\neach subcarrier must be estimated separately.

In this study, we propose how\nto construct the flow network model for online scheduling periodic real-time\ntasks on multiprocessors. Our key idea is to construct the flow network only\nfor the active instances of tasks at the current scheduling time, while\nguaranteeing the existence of an optimal schedule for the future instances of\nthe tasks. The optimal scheduling is here defined to ensure that all real-time\ntasks meet their deadlines when the total utilization demand of the given tasks\ndoes not exceed the total processing capacity.

We numerically confirm it comparing the\ncalculated results: For a weak field, a comparison is made with a description\nusing the bulk dielectric susceptibility. For a strong field, a comparison is\nmade with a multiscale Maxwell-TDDFT scheme which the authors' group developed\npreviously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 03:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

Recently, these distributions have played a crucial role in the analysis\nof algorithms for fundamental graph problems, e.g. Traveling Salesman Problem\n[Gharan, Saberi, Singh FOCS 11]. We prove a new matrix Chernoff bound for\nStrongly Rayleigh distributions.\n  As an immediate application, we show that adding together the Laplacians of\n$\\epsilon^{-2} \\log^2 n$ random spanning trees gives an $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$\nspectral sparsifiers of graph Laplacians with high probability. Thus, we\npositively answer an open question posed in [Baston, Spielman, Srivastava, Teng\nJACM 13]. Our number of spanning trees for spectral sparsifier matches the\nnumber of spanning trees required to obtain a cut sparsifier in [Fung,\nHariharan, Harvey, Panigraphi STOC 11]. The previous best result was by naively\napplying a classical matrix Chernoff bound which requires $\\epsilon^{-2} n \\log\nn$ spanning trees. For the tree averaging procedure to agree with the original\ngraph Laplacian in expectation, each edge of the tree should be reweighted by\nthe inverse of the edge leverage score in the original graph. We also show that\nwhen using this reweighting of the edges, the Laplacian of single random tree\nis bounded above in the PSD order by the original graph Laplacian times a\nfactor $\\log n$ with high probability, i.e. $L_T \\preceq O(\\log n) L_G$.\n  We show a lower bound that almost matches our last result, namely that in\nsome graphs, with high probability, the random spanning tree is $\\it{not}$\nbounded above in the spectral order by $\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$ times the\noriginal graph Laplacian. We also show a lower bound that in $\\epsilon^{-2}\n\\log n$ spanning trees are necessary to get a $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$ spectral\nsparsifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 03:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}

Firstly, remote sensing\nimages are segmented into super-pixels through the combination of SLIC and\nSEEDS. Structured forests is carried out to compute edge probability of each\npixel, based on which super-pixels are segmented more precisely. Segmented\nsuper-pixels compose a super-pixel level remote sensing database. Though cloud\ndetection is essentially a binary classification problem, our database is\nlabeled into four categories: thick cloud, cirrus cloud, building and other\nculture, to improve the generalization ability of our proposed models.\nSecondly, super-pixel level database is used to train our cloud detection\nmodels based on CNN and deep forest. Considering super-pixel level remote\nsensing images contain less semantic information compared with general object\nclassification database, we propose a Hierarchical Fusion CNN (HFCNN). It takes\nfull advantage of low-level features like color and texture information and is\nmore applicable to cloud detection task.

We study the following model where one adds Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi (ER)\ntype perturbation to a random geometric graph. More precisely, assume\n$G_\\mathcal{X}^{*}$ is a random geometric graph sampled from a nice measure on\na metric space $\\mathcal{X} = (X,d)$. The input observed graph\n$\\widehat{G}(p,q)$ is generated by removing each existing edge from\n$G_\\mathcal{X}^*$ with probability $p$, while inserting each non-existent edge\nto $G_\\mathcal{X}^{*}$ with probability $q$. We refer to such random\n$p$-deletion and $q$-insertion as ER-perturbation.

In this paper we consider a localized version\nof the classical notion of clique number for the aforementioned ER-perturbed\nrandom geometric graphs: Specifically, we study the edge clique number for each\nedge in a graph, defined as the size of the largest clique(s) in the graph\ncontaining that edge. The clique number of the graph is simply the largest edge\nclique number.

A theoretical approach capable of predicting such\nrapid transitions for neutron-rich systems would be a valuable tool to better\nunderstand r-process nucleosynthesis or the decay of super-heavy elements. In\nthis work, we investigate for the first time the transition from asymmetric to\nsymmetric fission through the calculation of primary fission yields with the\ntime-dependent generator coordinate method (TDGCM).

To cope\nwith these problems, training detectors from scratch is a feasible solution.\nHowever, the detectors trained from scratch generally perform worse than the\npretrained ones, even suffer from the convergence issue in training. In this\npaper, we explore to train object detectors from scratch robustly.

Registration is often phrased as\nan optimization problem, i.e., finding a deformation field that is optimal\naccording to a given objective function. Discrete, combinatorial, optimization\ntechniques have successfully been employed to solve the resulting optimization\nproblem. Specifically, optimization based on $\\alpha$-expansion with minimal\ngraph cuts has been proposed as a powerful tool for image registration. The\nhigh computational cost of the graph-cut based optimization approach, however,\nlimits the utility of this approach for registration of large volume images.\nMethods: Here, we propose to accelerate graph-cut based deformable registration\nby dividing the image into overlapping sub-regions and restricting the\n$\\alpha$-expansion moves to a single sub-region at a time. Results: We\ndemonstrate empirically that this approach can achieve a large reduction in\ncomputation time -- from days to minutes -- with only a small penalty in terms\nof solution quality. Conclusion: The reduction in computation time provided by\nthe proposed method makes graph cut based deformable registration viable for\nlarge volume images. Significance: Graph cut based image registration has\npreviously been shown to produce excellent results, but the high computational\ncost has hindered the adoption of the method for registration of large medical\nvolume images.

As a by product of\nself-localization of the proximate fermions, the spin subsystem hosts the\nlong-lived topological edge zero modes, which are dynamically decoupled from\nthe thermalized background Z2 charges of the bulk, and hence remains cold at\narbitrary high-energy density. This provides a convenient platform for strong\nprotection of the quantum bits of information which are embedded at the edges\nof completely ergodic sub-system; the phenomenon that in the absence of such\nproximity-induced self-localization could, at best, come about with a\npre-thermal manner in translational invariant systems. Finally, by breaking\nlocal Z2 symmetry of the model, we argue that such admixture of particles no\nlonger remains disentangled and the ergodic gauge degrees of freedom act as a\n\"small bath\" coupled to the localized components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 10:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 18:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

This letter presents the first results from a series of\nhigh-resolution numerical models, aimed at deciphering the effect of the\ninitial conditions and of stellar feedback on the evolution of the galactic\nmagnetic field in isolated, Milky-Way-like galaxies. The models start with an\nordered, either poloidal or toroidal, magnetic field of varying strength, and\nare evolved with and without supernova feedback. They include a dark matter\nhalo, a stellar and a gaseous disk, as well as the appropriate cooling and\nheating processes for the interstellar medium. Independently of the initial\nconditions, the galaxies develop a turbulent velocity field and a random\nmagnetic field component in under 15 Myrs. Supernova feedback is extremely\nefficient in building a random magnetic field component up to large galactic\nheights. However, a random magnetic field emerges even in runs without\nfeedback, which points to an inherent instability of the ordered component.\nSupernova feedback greatly affects the velocity field of the galaxy up to large\ngalactic heights, and helps restructure the magnetic field up to 10 kpc above\nthe disk, independently of the initial magnetic field morphology. On the other\nhand, the initial morphology of the magnetic field can accelerate the\ndevelopment of a random component at large heights. These effects have\nimportant implications for the study of the magnetic field evolution in galaxy\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 11:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Specifically, both zero-order and first-order\nknowledge depicted in the fine annotated images and unlabeled auxiliary data\nare transferred to regularize our student learning. The proposed method can\nimprove existing fast segmentation models without incurring extra computational\noverhead, so it can still process images with the same fast speed.

This is puzzling, because (i) no\nStandard Model (SM) particle is expected to survive passage through Earth at\nsuch energies and incident angles, and (ii) no such events were reported by\nIceCube. In this paper, we address both these issues by invoking a beyond SM\ninterpretation of the EeV events as due to the decay of a long-lived bino in\nthe R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry. In particular, a TeV-scale\nslepton/squark can be resonantly produced through the interaction of the EeV\nneutrino with electrons/nucleons inside Earth, that decays to a light,\nlong-lived bino, which survives the propagation through Earth matter before\ndecaying back to neutrinos, leptons and/or quarks, thus producing upgoing air\nshowers in the atmosphere near ANITA. We find that the ANITA events can be\nexplained with a GeV-scale bino and ${\\cal O}(0.1)$ RPV couplings, which are\nconsistent with all existing high and low-energy constraints.

Synchronization in neuronal networks have attracted much attention\nin recent years with the main focus on transition type. Whether one obtains\nexplosive transition or a continuous transition is an important feature of the\nneuronal network which can depend on network structure as well as synaptic\ntypes. In this study we consider the effect of synaptic interaction (electrical\nand chemical) as well as structural connectivity on synchronization transition\nin network models of Izhikevich neurons which spike regularly with beta\nrhythms. We find a wide range of behavior including continuous transition,\nexplosive transition, as well as lack of global order. The stronger electrical\nsynapses are more conducive to synchronization and can even lead to explosive\nsynchronization. The key network element which determines the order of\ntransition is found to be the clustering coefficient and not the small world\neffect, or the existence of hubs in a network. These results are in contrast to\nprevious results which use phase oscillator models such as the Kuramoto model.\nFurthermore, we show that the patterns of synchronization changes when one goes\nto the gamma band. We attribute such a change to the change in the refractory\nperiod of Izhikevich neurons which changes significantly with frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 13:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}

We focus on transport phenomena aiming at representing the\nchromosphere of the Sun. Graille et al. [M3AS 19(04):527-599, 2009] have\nderived an asymptotic fluid model for multicomponent plamas from kinetic\ntheory, yielding a rigorous description of the dissipative effects. The\ngoverning equations and consistent transport properties are obtained using a\nmultiscale Chapman-Enskog perturbative solution to the Boltzmann equation based\non a non-dimensional analysis. The mass disparity between the electrons and\nheavy particles is accounted for, as well as the influence of the\nelectromagnetic field. We couple this model to the Maxwell equations for the\nelectromagnetic field and derive the generalized Ohm's law for multicomponent\nplasmas. The model inherits a well-identified mathematical structure leading to\nan extended range of validity for the Sun chromosphere conditions. We compute\nconsistent transport properties by means of a spectral Galerkin method using\nthe Laguerre-Sonine polynomial approximation. Two non-vanishing polynomial\nterms are used when deriving the transport systems for electrons, whereas only\none term is retained for heavy particles. In a simplified framework where the\nplasma is fully ionized, we compare the transport properties for the Sun\nchromosphere to conventional expressions for magnetized plasmas due to\nBraginskii, showing a good agreement between both results. For more general\npartially ionized conditions, representative of the Sun chromosphere, we\ncompute the muticomponent transport properties corresponding to the species\ndiffusion velocities, heavy-particle and electron heat fluxes, and viscous\nstress tensor of the model, for a Helium-Hydrogen mixture in local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. The model is assessed for the 3D radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation of a pore, in the highly turbulent upper layer\nof the solar convective zone. The resistive term is found to dominate mainly\nthe dynamics of the electric field at the pore location. The battery term for\nheavy particles appears to be higher at the pore location and at some\nintergranulation boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 13:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

The connection between the Klein tunneling times of\nelectrons and cut-off frequencies of graphene devices is not obvious. We argue\nin this paper that the trajectory-based Bohmian approach gives a very natural\nframework to quantify Klein tunneling times in linear band graphene devices\nbecause of its ability to distinguish, not only between transmitted and\nreflected electrons, but also between reflected electrons that spend time in\nthe barrier and those that do not. Without such distinction, typical\nexpressions found in the literature to compute dwell times can give unphysical\nresults when applied to predict cut-off frequencies. In particular, we study\nKlein tunneling times for electrons in a two-terminal graphene device\nconstituted by a potential barrier between two metallic contacts. We show that\nfor a zero incident angle (and positive or negative kinetic energy), the\ntransmission coefficient is equal to one, and the dwell time is roughly equal\nto the barrier distance divided by the Fermi velocity. For electrons incident\nwith a non-zero angle smaller than the critical angle, the transmission\ncoefficient decreases and dwell time can still be easily predicted in the\nBohmian framework. The main conclusion of this work is that, contrary to\ntunneling devices with parabolic bands, the high graphene mobility is roughly\nindependent of the presence of Klein tunneling phenomena in the active device\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 13:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 09:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 08:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

We find that the correlation profiles of the structural\nmeasures significantly differ across network domains and the domain can be\nefficiently determined using a small selection of graph metrics.

It requires a large amount of user data (such as user\nshopping records and movie ratings) to predict personal preferences, and\nthereby provides users high-quality recommendation services, which expose the\nrisk of leakage of user privacy. Differential privacy, as a provable privacy\nprotection framework, has been applied widely to recommendation systems. It is\ncommon that different individuals have different levels of privacy requirements\non items. However, traditional differential privacy can only provide a uniform\nlevel of privacy protection for all users.\n  In this paper, we mainly propose a probabilistic matrix factorization\nrecommendation scheme with personalized differential privacy (PDP-PMF). It aims\nto meet users' privacy requirements specified at the item-level instead of\ngiving the same level of privacy guarantees for all. We then develop a modified\nsampling mechanism (with bounded differential privacy) for achieving PDP. We\nalso perform a theoretical analysis of the PDP-PMF scheme and demonstrate the\nprivacy of the PDP-PMF scheme. In addition, we implement the probabilistic\nmatrix factorization schemes both with traditional and with personalized\ndifferential privacy (DP-PMF, PDP-PMF) and compare them through a series of\nexperiments.

However, most of the\nexisting interpretation techniques are designed for interpreting a certain\nseismic pattern (e.g., faults and salt domes) in a given seismic dataset at one\ntime; correspondingly, the rest patterns would be ignored. Interpreting all the\nimportant seismic patterns becomes feasible with the aid of multiple\nclassification techniques. When implementing them into the seismic domain,\nhowever, the major drawback is the low efficiency particularly for a large\ndataset, since the classification need to be repeated at every seismic sample.\nTo resolve such limitation, this study first present a seismic pattern\ninterpretation dataset (SpiDat), which tentatively categorizes 12\ncommonly-observed seismic patterns based on their signal intensity and lateral\ngeometry, including these of important geologic implications such as faults,\nsalt domes, gas chimneys, and depositional sequences.

Many of these approaches focus on reducing\nprediction errors while maximizing sole utility of the institution. This work\nseeks to reconceptualize and critically frame the existing discourse on\nfairness by underlining the implicit biases embedded in common understandings\nof fairness in the literature and how they contrast with its corresponding\neconomic and legal definitions. This paper expands the concept of utility and\nfairness by bringing in concepts from established literature in welfare\neconomics and game theory. We then translate these concepts for the algorithmic\nprediction domain by defining a formalization of Nash Welfare Product that\nseeks to expand utility by collapsing that of the institution using the\nprediction tool and the individual subject to the prediction into one function.\nWe then apply a modulating function that makes the fairness and welfare\ntrade-offs explicit based on designated policy goals and then apply it to a\ntemporal model to take into account the effects of decisions beyond the scope\nof one-shot predictions. We apply this on a binary classification problem and\npresent results of a multi-epoch simulation based on the UCI Adult Income\ndataset and a test case analysis of the ProPublica recidivism dataset that show\nthat expanding the concept of utility results in a fairer distribution\ncorrecting for the embedded biases in the dataset without sacrificing the\nclassifier accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 15:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-22"}

In Upper Sco and the Pleiades, these low mass binary stars have periods\nthat are much shorter on average and much closer to each other than would be\ntrue if drawn at random from the M dwarf single stars. In Upper Sco, this\ndifference correlates strongly with the presence or absence of infrared\nexcesses due to primordial circumstellar disks -- the single star population\nincludes many stars with disks, and their rotation periods are distinctively\nlonger on average than their binary star cousins of the same mass. By Praesepe\nage, the significance of the difference in rotation rate between the single and\nbinary low mass dMs is much less, suggesting that angular momentum loss from\nwinds for fully-convective zero-age main sequence stars erases memory of the\nrotation rate dichotomy for binary and single very low mass stars at later\nages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 15:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

The mechanical parts such as a motor, gear, bearings are the major\ncomponents of a process industry and any fault in them may cause a total\nshutdown of the whole process, which may result in serious losses. Therefore,\nit is very crucial to predict any approaching defects before its occurrence.\nSeveral methods exist for this purpose and many research are being carried out\nfor better and efficient models. However, most of them are based on the\nprocessing of raw sensor signals, which is tedious and expensive. Recently,\nthere has been an increase in the feature based condition monitoring, where\nonly the useful features are extracted from the raw signals and interpreted for\nthe prediction of the fault. Most of these are handcrafted features, where\nthese are manually obtained based on the nature of the raw data. This of course\nrequires the prior knowledge of the nature of data and related processes. This\nlimits the feature extraction process. However, recent development in the\nautoencoder based feature extraction method provides an alternative to the\ntraditional handcrafted approaches; however, they have mostly been confined in\nthe area of image and audio processing. In this work, we have developed an\nautomated feature extraction method for on-line condition monitoring based on\nthe stack of the traditional autoencoder and an on-line sequential extreme\nlearning machine(OSELM) network. The performance of this method is comparable\nto that of the traditional feature extraction approaches.

With the advent of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)\ntherapies, it has become increasingly important to detect center-involved\ndiabetic macular edema (ci-DME). However, center-involved diabetic macular\nedema is diagnosed using optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is not\ngenerally available at screening sites because of cost and workflow\nconstraints. Instead, screening programs rely on the detection of hard exudates\nin color fundus photographs as a proxy for DME, often resulting in high false\npositive or false negative calls. To improve the accuracy of DME screening, we\ntrained a deep learning model to use color fundus photographs to predict\nci-DME.

An ictal episode evolves due to acute disturbance of the fine-tuned\nbalance between excitatory vs. inhibitory inputs within a neural network in\nfavor of excitation. The current literature that proposes the\nactivity-dependent disinhibition as a valid mechanism of chronic epilepsy, does\nnot provide clues on why this mechanism emerges only in epileptic patients and\nhow the vicious circle resulting of an activity-dependent disinhibition in\nover-active ictogenic network would end. A new model, which presents chronic\nepilepsy as a disease of faulty architecture of the neural circuit, is\ndiscussed. Wherein; variable genetic or acquired predisposing factors drive\nabnormalities in the construction of multiple neural circuits resulting in an\nactivity-dependent positive feedback excitatory loops which transform normal\nneural circuits into ictal foci. Such new mechanism, for igniting an\nactivity-dependent unstable excitation with subsequent relatively stable\ndisinhibition, leads to an ictal escape rhythm. The propagation of such\nbursting activity occurs either electrochemically via synaptic communication to\nremote susceptible circuits, or chemically via a trigger wave which recruits\nthe non-connected proximal neurons. Termination occurs abruptly when the\ninhibitory interneurons functionally recover and reimpose their inhibitory\neffect on the ictogenic circuit to transform the escape rhythm into a normal,\nunder-control output. The proposed model elucidates various enigmatic features\nof the disease; and illustrates both the end-result ictogenic mechanism arising\nfrom the wide variety of etiologies of human spontaneous and acquired epilepsy,\nand the timing of episodic transitions from normal activity to seizures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 21:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}
