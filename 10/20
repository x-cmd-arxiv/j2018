From this rheology we infer the\nstatic friction coefficient and effective viscosity that decrease when\nincreasing the vibration intensity.

We propose an interference-canceled\nopportunistic antenna selection (IC-OAS) scheme to enhance physical-layer\nsecurity for the heterogeneous network. To be specific, when MBS sends its\nconfidential message to MU through an opportunistic distributed antenna, a\nspecial signal is artificially designed and emitted at MBS to ensure that the\nreceived interference at MU from SBS is canceled out.

The cavity is designed to resonate and enable perfect\nabsorption in the film at the chosen wavelength \\lambda. However, in current\nstate-of-the-art designs, a still large absorbing film thickness (\\lambda/50)\nis needed and tuning the perfect absorption wavelength over a broad range\nrequires changing the cavity materials. Here, we introduce a new resonant\ncavity concept to achieve perfect absorption of infrared light in much thinner\nand thus really nanoscale films, with a broad wavelength tunability using a\nsingle set of cavity materials. It requires a nanofilm with giant refractive\nindex and small extinction coefficient (found in emerging semi-metals,\nsemi-conductors and topological insulators) backed by a transparent spacer and\na metal mirror. The nanofilm acts both as absorber and multiple reflector for\nthe internal cavity waves, which after escaping follow a fractal phasor\ntrajectory. This enables a totally destructive optical interference for a\nnanofilm thickness more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than \\lambda.

These\nself-consistent studies considered a BHNS system with mass ratio $q=3:1$, BH\nspin $a/M_{BH}=0.75$ aligned with the total orbital angular momentum (OAM), and\na NS that is irrotational, threaded by an aligned B field, and modeled by an\n$\\Gamma$--law equation of state with $\\Gamma=2$.

However, the granularity of these subword units is a\nhyperparameter to be tuned for each language and task, using methods such as\ngrid search. Tuning may be done inexhaustively or skipped entirely due to\nresource constraints, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we\npropose a method to automatically tune this parameter using only one training\npass. We incrementally introduce new vocabulary online based on the held-out\nvalidation loss, beginning with smaller, general subwords and adding larger,\nmore specific units over the course of training. Our method matches the results\nfound with grid search, optimizing segmentation granularity without any\nadditional training time. We also show benefits in training efficiency and\nperformance improvements for rare words due to the way embeddings for larger\nunits are incrementally constructed by combining those from smaller units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 18:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

The streamwise\ninter-particle spacing between aligned particles at equilibrium was calculated\nand compared to available experimental data in square channel flow (Gao {\\it et\nal.} Microfluidics and Nanofluidics {\\bf 21}, 154 (2017)). The new result\nhighlighted by our numerical simulations is that the inter-particle spacing is\nunconditionally stable only for a limited number of aligned particles in a\nsingle train, the threshold number being dependent on the confinement\n(particle-to-channel size ratio) and on the Reynolds number. For instance, when\nthe particle Reynolds number is $\\approx1$ and the particle-to-channel height\nsize ratio is $\\approx0.1$, the maximum number of stable aligned particles per\ntrain is equal to 3. This agrees with statistics realized on the experiments of\n(Gao {\\it et al.} Microfluidics and Nanofluidics {\\bf 21}, 154 (2017)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

This is as well a design driving requirement\nfor many instruments at the European Spallation Source (ESS), which aspires to\nbe the brightest neutron source of the world. The SBR can be effectively\nimproved with background reduction. The Multi-Grid, a large-area thermal\nneutron detector with a solid boron carbide converter, is a novel solution for\nchopper spectrometers. This detector will be installed for the three\nprospective chopper spectrometers at the ESS. As the Multi-Grid detector is a\nlarge area detector with a complex structure, its intrinsic background and its\nsuppression via advanced shielding design should be investigated in its\ncomplexity, as it cannot be naively calculated. The intrinsic scattered neutron\nbackground and its effect on the SBR is determined via a detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulation for the Multi-Grid detector module, designed for the CSPEC\ninstrument at the ESS.

In this case mobile\nspecies can diffuse over long distances through the fast phase in the time\nscale of diffusion in the slow phase. At macroscopic scale, contrasted phase\ndiffusivities lead to a memory effect that cannot be properly described by\nclassical Fick's second law. Here we obtain effective governing equations\nthrough a two-scale approach for composite materials consisting of a fast\nmatrix and slow inclusions. The micro-macro transition is similar to\nfirst-order computational homogenisation, and involves the solution of a\ntransient diffusion boundary-value problem in a Representative Volume Element\nof the microstructure. Different from computational homogenisation, we propose\na semi-analytical mean-field estimate of the composite response based on the\nexact solution for a single inclusion developed in our previous work [Brassart,\nL., Stainier, L., 2018.

The history-dependent macroscopic response\nadmits a representation based on internal variables, enabling efficient time\nintegration.

However, wet-lab experiments for detecting SLs are\nfaced with various challenges, such as high cost, low consistency across\nplatforms or cell lines. Therefore, computational prediction methods are needed\nto address these issues. This paper proposes a novel SL prediction method,\nnamed SL2MF, which employs logistic matrix factorization to learn latent\nrepresentations of genes from the observed SL data. The probability that two\ngenes are likely to form SL is modeled by the linear combination of gene latent\nvectors. As known SL pairs are more trustworthy than unknown pairs, we design\nimportance weighting schemes to assign higher importance weights for known SL\npairs and lower importance weights for unknown pairs in SL2MF. Moreover, we\nalso incorporate biological knowledge about genes from protein-protein\ninteraction (PPI) data and Gene Ontology (GO). In particular, we calculate the\nsimilarity between genes based on their GO annotations and topological\nproperties in the PPI network. Extensive experiments on the SL interaction data\nfrom SynLethDB database have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nSL2MF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 01:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

It is well known that\nthe ML estimator exists when the data is non-separable, but fails to exist when\nthe data is separable. First-order methods are the algorithms of choice for\nsolving large-scale instances of the logistic regression problem. In this\npaper, we introduce a pair of condition numbers that measure the degree of\nnon-separability or separability of a given dataset in the setting of binary\nclassification, and we study how these condition numbers relate to and inform\nthe properties and the convergence guarantees of first-order methods. When the\ntraining data is non-separable, we show that the degree of non-separability\nnaturally enters the analysis and informs the properties and convergence\nguarantees of two standard first-order methods: steepest descent (for any given\nnorm) and stochastic gradient descent. Expanding on the work of Bach, we also\nshow how the degree of non-separability enters into the analysis of linear\nconvergence of steepest descent (without needing strong convexity), as well as\nthe adaptive convergence of stochastic gradient descent. When the training data\nis separable, first-order methods rather curiously have good empirical success,\nwhich is not well understood in theory. In the case of separable data, we\ndemonstrate how the degree of separability enters into the analysis of $\\ell_2$\nsteepest descent and stochastic gradient descent for delivering\napproximate-maximum-margin solutions with associated computational guarantees\nas well. This suggests that first-order methods can lead to statistically\nmeaningful solutions in the separable case, even though the ML solution does\nnot exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 01:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

The eigenfunction\nconstruction is optimization-based with no dictionary selection required.

Rather than having\njust one decision maker deciding which arm to pull in each round, we have $n$\ndifferent decision makers (agents). In the simple stochastic setting, we show\nthat a \"free-riding\" agent observing another \"self-reliant\" agent can achieve\njust $O(1)$ regret, as opposed to the regret lower bound of $\\Omega (\\log t)$\nwhen one decision maker is playing in isolation. This result holds whenever the\nself-reliant agent's strategy satisfies either one of two assumptions: (1) each\narm is pulled at least $\\gamma \\ln t$ times in expectation for a constant\n$\\gamma$ that we compute, or (2) the self-reliant agent achieves $o(t)$\nrealized regret with high probability. Both of these assumptions are satisfied\nby standard zero-regret algorithms. Under the second assumption, we further\nshow that the free rider only needs to observe the number of times each arm is\npulled by the self-reliant agent, and not the rewards realized.\n  In the linear contextual setting, each arm has a distribution over parameter\nvectors, each agent has a context vector, and the reward realized when an agent\npulls an arm is the inner product of that agent's context vector with a\nparameter vector sampled from the pulled arm's distribution.

We suggest an experimentally challenging, but\nmodel--independent way to assess which zero charge, isospin-zero mesons have a\nlarge gluonium light-front wavefunction component in the quark and gluon Fock\nspace of QCD. Our method exploits QCD counting rules which relate the power-law\nfall-off of production amplitudes at high momentum transfer to the meson's\ntwist (dimension minus spin of its minimum interpolating operators). Scalar\n$0^+$ glueballs composed of two valence gluons with zero internal orbital\nangular momentum have twist $\\tau=2$. In contrast, quark-antiquark $|q \\bar q\n\\rangle $ scalar mesons have twist $\\tau \\ge 3$ since they have nonzero orbital\nangular momentum, and multi-quark states such as $|q q \\bar q \\bar q \\rangle$\ntetraquarks yield twist $\\tau \\ge 4$. Thus, the production cross section for\nboth $|q\\bar{q}\\rangle$ and $|qq\\bar{q}\\bar{q}\\rangle$ mesons will be\nsuppressed by at least one power of momentum transfer relative to glueball\nproduction. For example, in single inclusive particle hadroproduction $ A B \\to\nC X$, the cross section for glueball production at high transverse momentum\n$p_T$ and fixed $x_T = 2 {p_T\\over \\sqrt s} $ will dominate higher twist mesons\nby at least two powers of $p_T$. Similarly, in exclusive production processes\nat large CM energy and fixed CM angle, the glueball rate dominates by a power\nof $s$: we illustrate the method with a simple reaction, $e^-e^+ \\to \\phi f_0$\nwhere the $f_0$ can be tested to be a glueball versus another type of scalar\nmeson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 08:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

The possibility to reversibly drive the rigid inclusions\nwithin such a composite together to a close-to-touching state by an external\nstimulus would offer important benefits. Then, a significant tuning of the\nmechanical properties could be achieved due to the resulting mechanical\nhardening. For a long time, it has been argued whether a virtual touching of\nthe embedded magnetic particles with subsequent detachment can actually be\nobserved in real materials, and if so, whether the process is reversible. Here,\nwe present experimental results that demonstrate this phenomenon in reality.\nOur system consists of two paramagnetic nickel particles embedded at finite\ninitial distance in a soft elastic polymeric gel matrix. Magnetization in an\nexternal magnetic field tunes the magnetic attraction between the particles and\ndrives the process. We quantify the scenario by different theoretical tools,\ni.e., explicit analytical calculations in the framework of linear elasticity\ntheory, a projection onto simplified dipole-spring models, as well as detailed\nfinite-element simulations. From these different approaches, we conclude that\nin our case the cycle of virtual touching and detachment shows hysteretic\nbehavior due to the mutual magnetization between the paramagnetic particles.\nOur results are important for the design and construction of reversibly tunable\nmechanical damping devices. Moreover, our projection on dipole-spring models\nallows the formal connection of our description to various related systems,\ne.g., magnetosome filaments in magnetotactic bacteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 10:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

The disorder caused by the\nsubstitution of the heavier element Ga for Si is sufficient to reduce the\npinning of the SKL to the underlying crystalline lattice.

A major limitation of the standard PF method is that the\ndimensionality of the state space increases as the time proceeds and eventually\nmay cause degeneracy of the algorithm. A possible approach to alleviate the\ndegeneracy issue is to compute the marginal posterior distribution at each time\nstep, which leads to the so-called marginal PF method. A key issue in the\nmarginal PF method is to construct a good sampling distribution in the marginal\nspace. When the posterior distribution is close to Gaussian, the Ensemble\nKalman filter (EnKF) method can usually provide a good sampling distribution;\nhowever the EnKF approximation may fail completely when the posterior is\nstrongly non-Gaussian. In this work we propose a defensive marginal PF (DMPF)\nalgorithm which constructs a sampling distribution in the marginal space by\ncombining the standard PF and the EnKF approximation using a multiple\nimportance sampling (MIS) scheme. An important feature of the proposed\nalgorithm is that it can automatically adjust the relative weight of the PF and\nthe EnKF components in the MIS scheme in each step, according to how\nnon-Gaussian the posterior is. With numerical examples we demonstrate that the\nproposed method can perform well regardless of whether the posteriors can be\nwell approximated by Gaussian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 11:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 16:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 13:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 10:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Recently, direct-absorption\nparabolic trough solar collector (DAPTSC) using nanofluids has been proposed,\nand its thermal efficiency has been reported to be 5-10$\\%$ higher than the\nconventional SBPTSC for inlet temperature up to 250$^\\circ$C. However, the\ninner tubes of the receivers of the existing DAPTSCs are all transparent, so\nthe sun rays entering the inner tube can only travel once through the\nnanofluids. As a result, the optical path length for the sun rays is limited by\nthe inner tube size, which in turn requires high value of the absorption\ncoefficient of nanofluids. Due to the approximately linear relation between the\nabsorption coefficient and the particle concentration, higher absorption\ncoefficient is likely to cause particle agglomeration, leading to detrimental\neffects on maintaining stable collector performance. In the current study, the\ntransparent DAPTSC is improved by applying a reflective coating on the upper\nhalf of the inner tube outer surface, such that the optical path length is\ndoubled compared to the transparent DAPTSC; thus, the absorption coefficient of\nthe nanofluids can be reduced accordingly. The coated DAPTSC is found to have\nobvious advantage compared to the transparent DAPTSC at absorption coefficient\nbelow 0.5 cm$^{-1}$ for a receiver with inner tube diameter of 7 cm. In\naddition, performance of the transparent DAPTSC, the coated DAPTSC and the\nSBPTSC with black chrome coating have been compared to explore their\nadvantageous operation conditions, such as inner tube diameter, flow rate, and\ninlet temperature, with or without a glass envelope for vacuum evacuation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 13:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

Adopting conventional techniques like scan-chains open up\navenues for attacks, and hence cannot be adopted in a straight-forward manner\nfor security chips. Furthermore, testing becomes incredibly challenging for the\npromising class of hardware security primitives, called PUFs, which offer\nunique properties like unclonability, unpredictibility, uniformity, uniqueness,\nand yet easily computable. However, the definition of PUF itself poses a\nchallenge on test engineers, simply because it has no golden response for a\ngiven input, often called challenge. In this paper, we develop a novel test\nstrategy considering that the fabrication of a batch of $N>1$ PUFs is\nequivalent to drawing random instances of Boolean mappings. We hence model the\nPUFs as black-box Boolean functions of dimension $m\\times1$, and show\ncombinatorially that random designs of such functions exhibit\ncorrelation-spectra which can be used to characterize random and thus {\\em\ngood} designs of PUFs. We first develop theoretical results to quantize the\ncorrelation values, and subsequently the expected number of pairs of such\nBoolean functions which should belong to a given spectra. In addition to this,\nwe show through extensive experimental results that a randomly chosen sample of\nsuch PUFs also resemble the correlation-spectra property of the overall PUF\npopulation. Interestingly, we show through experimental results on $50$ FPGAs\nthat when the PUFs are infected by faults the usual randomness tests for the\nPUF outputs such as uniformity, fail to detect any aberration. However, the\nspectral-pattern is clearly shown to get affected, which we demonstrate by\nstandard statistical tools. We finally propose a systematic testing framework\nfor the evaluation of PUFs by observing the correlation-spectra of the PUF\ninstances under test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 15:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

We identified the trajectories of the grains that migrated to the growing\nhorns, and found that most of them came from upstream regions on the periphery\nof the initial heap, with an average displacement of the order of the heap\nsize. In addition, we show that individual grains had transverse displacements\nby rolling and sliding that are not negligible, with many of them going around\nthe heap. The mechanism of horns formation revealed by our experiments\ncontrasts with the general picture that barchan horns form from the advance of\nthe lateral dune flanks due to the scaling of migration velocity with the\ninverse of dune size.

This paper\ndemonstrates how ontology sharing is formalizable within the conceptual\nknowledge model of Information Flow (IF). Information Flow indirectly\nrepresents sharing through a specifiable, ontology extension hierarchy\naugmented with synonymic type equivalencing - two ontologies share terminology\nand meaning through a common generic ontology that each extends. Using the\nparadigm of participant community ontologies formalized as IF logics, a common\nshared extensible ontology formalized as an IF theory, participant community\nspecification links from the common ontology to the participating community\nontology formalizable as IF theory interpretations, this paper argues that\nontology sharing is concentrated in a virtual ontology of community\nconnections, and demonstrates how this virtual ontology is computable as the\nfusion of the participant ontologies - the quotient of the sum of the\nparticipant ontologies modulo the ontological sharing structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 19:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

In recent years, fabrication of CMUT on glass substrates has raised\nsignificant interests because a number of advantages it can offer. First,\nparasitic capacitance could be easily reduced since glass is an insulating\nmaterial. Second, insulation steps required in the silicon-based CMUT\nfabrication process could be avoided, leading to a reduced fabrication\ncomplexity. Third, anodic bonding can be used when the substrate is\nborosilicate glass, which is a low-temperature bonding technique and has a high\ntolerance to bonding surface area and roughness in addition to the advantages\nof silicon wafer bonding. Moreover, glass transparency can enable novel\napplications beyond pulse-echo ultrasound medical imaging and enlarge the\npotential markets of CMUTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}
