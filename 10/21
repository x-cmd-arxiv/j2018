Inspired by recent works, we elaborate further on the possibility of\nsignificant primordial tensor non-Gaussianities sourced by extra fields during\ninflation. Unitarity constraints limit the impact of extra (spinning) particle\ncontent by means of a lower bound on the corresponding mass spectrum. For\nspin-2 particles, this takes the form of the well-known Higuchi bound. Massive\n($m\\gtrsim H$) particles will typically decay during inflation unless they are\nnon-minimally coupled to the inflaton sector: the inflating field \"lifts\" the\ndynamics of the extra field(s), effectively getting around the limits imposed\nby unitarity. There exist several models that realize such a mechanism, but we\nfocus here on the set-up of [1] where, through an EFT approach, one is able to\ncapture the essential features common to an entire class of theories. In the\npresence of an extra massive spin-2 particle, the interactions in the tensor\nsector mimic very closely those in the scalar sector of quasi-single-field\ninflationary models. We calculate the tensor bispectrum in different\nconfigurations and extract its dependence on the extra tensor sound speed.

Due to the amount of data parallelism in these algorithms,\nhigh-performance 3D manycore platforms that incorporate both CPUs and GPUs\npresent a promising direction. However, as systems use heterogeneity (e.g., a\ncombination of CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators) to improve performance and\nefficiency, it becomes more pertinent to address the distinct and likely\nconflicting communication requirements (e.g., CPU memory access latency or GPU\nnetwork throughput) that arise from such heterogeneity. Unfortunately, it is\ndifficult to quickly explore the hardware design space and choose appropriate\ntradeoffs between these heterogeneous requirements. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the design of a 3D Network-on-Chip (NoC) for\nheterogeneous manycore platforms that considers the appropriate design\nobjectives for a 3D heterogeneous system and explores various tradeoffs using\nan efficient ML-based multi-objective optimization technique. The proposed\ndesign space exploration considers the various requirements of its\nheterogeneous components and generates a set of 3D NoC architectures that\nefficiently trades off these design objectives.

However, current research\nrelying on image-based data often relies on hand coding of images which is time\nconsuming and costly, ultimately limiting the scope of the study. Current best\npractices in automated image classification (e.g., support vector machine\n(SVM), Backpropagation (BP) neural network, and artificial neural network) are\nlimited in their capacity to accurately distinguish between objects within\nimages. Objective: This study demonstrates how convolutional neural network\n(CNN) can be used to extract unique features within an image and how SVM can\nthen be used to classify the image. Methods: Images of waterpipes or hookah (an\nemerging tobacco product possessing similar harms to that of cigarettes) were\ncollected from Instagram and used in analyses (n=840). CNN was used to extract\nunique features from images identified to contain waterpipes. A SVM classifier\nwas built to distinguish between images with and without waterpipes. Methods\nfor image classification were then compared to show how a CNN + SVM classifier\ncould improve accuracy. Results: As the number of the validated training images\nincreased, the total number of extracted features increased. Additionally, as\nthe number of features learned by the SVM classifier increased, the average\nlevel of accuracy increased. Overall, 99.5% of the 420 images classified were\ncorrectly identified as either hookah or non-hookah images. This level of\naccuracy was an improvement over earlier methods that used SVM, CNN or Bag of\nFeatures (BOF) alone. Conclusions: CNN extracts more features of the images\nallowing a SVM classifier to be better informed, resulting in higher accuracy\ncompared with methods that extract fewer features. Future research can use this\nmethod to grow the scope of image-based studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2018 02:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

The capture\nof CO2 has been difficult due to its extremely high stability. In this study,\nwe propose a simple and yet effective approach for capture and storage of CO2\nby C6Li6. C6Li6 possesses a planar star-like structure, whose ionization energy\nis lower than that of Li atom and hence, it behaves as a superalkali.\nSuperalkalis are unusual species possessing lower ionization energies than\nalkali atoms. We have systematically studied the interaction of successive CO2\nmolecules with C6Li6 using long-range dispersion corrected density functional\n{\\omega}B97xD/6-311+G(d) calculations. We notice that these interactions lead\nto stable C6Li6-nCO2 complexes (n = 1-6) in which the structure of CO2 moieties\nis bent appreciably (122-125deg) due to electron transfer from C6Li6, whose\nplanarity is distorted only slightly (less than or equal to 7 deg). This\nclearly suggests that the CO2 molecules can successfully be activated and\ncaptured by C6Li6. We have also analyzed bond-lengths and bond-angle of CO2,\ntheir charges and adsorption energy as a function of the number of adsorbed CO2\n(n). It has been also noticed that the bond-length of CO2 in C6Li6-nCO2\ncomplexes increases monotonically whereas adsorption energy decreases, ranging\n3.18-2.79 eV per CO2 with the increase in n.

However, it can take a long time for DNNs to make an\ninference on resource-constrained computing devices. Model compression\ntechniques can address the computation issue of deep inference on embedded\ndevices. This technique is highly attractive, as it does not rely on\nspecialized hardware, or computation-offloading that is often infeasible due to\nprivacy concerns or high latency. However, it remains unclear how model\ncompression techniques perform across a wide range of DNNs. To design efficient\nembedded deep learning solutions, we need to understand their behaviors. This\nwork develops a quantitative approach to characterize model compression\ntechniques on a representative embedded deep learning architecture, the NVIDIA\nJetson Tx2. We perform extensive experiments by considering 11 influential\nneural network architectures from the image classification and the natural\nlanguage processing domains. We experimentally show that how two mainstream\ncompression techniques, data quantization and pruning, perform on these network\narchitectures and the implications of compression techniques to the model\nstorage size, inference time, energy consumption and performance metrics. We\ndemonstrate that there are opportunities to achieve fast deep inference on\nembedded systems, but one must carefully choose the compression settings.

The MCN can also automatically detect bad points. The price\nof these advantages is two additional parameters, both with specific and useful\ninterpretations: proportion of good observations and degree of contamination.\nHowever, points may be bad in some dimensions but good in others. The use of an\noverall proportion of good observations and of an overall degree of\ncontamination is limiting. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multiple\nscaled contaminated normal (MSCN) distribution with a proportion of good\nobservations and a degree of contamination for each dimension. Once the model\nis fitted, each observation has a posterior probability of being good with\nrespect to each dimension.

In order to do that, a CDN measures the latency on the\npaths from its servers to users and then selects a best available server for\neach user. For large CDNs, monitoring paths from thousands of servers to\nmillions of users is a challenging task due to its size. In this paper, we\naddress this problem and propose a framework to scale the task of path\nmonitoring. Simply stated, the goal of our framework is clustering IP addresses\n(clients) such that in each cluster the choice of best available server is same\n(or similar). Then, finding a best available server for one client in a given\ncluster will be sufficient to assign that server to the rest of the clients in\nthe cluster.\n  To achieve this goal, first we introduce two distance metrics to compute how\nsimilar the server choices of any given two clients. Second, we use a\nclustering method that is based on interdomain routing information. We evaluate\nthe goodness of our clusters by using the metrics we introduce. We show that\nthere is a strong correlation between the similarity in how two destination\nclients are routed to in the Internet and the similarity in their server\nselections. Finally, we show how to choose representative clients from each\ncluster so that it is sufficient to learn the latencies from the CDN servers to\nthe representative and find a best available server accordingly for the rest of\nthe clients in the same cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2018 13:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

On the other side, unlike DRAM systems, NVMs can retain\ndata even after power loss and thus enlarge the attack surface. While data\nencryption and integrity verification have been proposed earlier for DRAM\nsystems, protecting and recovering secure memories becomes more challenging\nwith persistent memory. Specifically, security metadata, e.g., encryption\ncounters and Merkle Tree data, should be securely persisted and recovered\nacross system reboots and during recovery from crashes. Not persisting updates\nto security metadata can lead to data inconsistency, in addition to serious\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n  In this paper, we pioneer a new direction that explores persistency of both\nMerkle Tree and encryption counters to enable secure recovery of\ndata-verifiable and encrypted memory systems.

We discuss the requirements for such\npersistently secure systems, propose novel optimizations, and evaluate the\nimpact of the proposed relaxation schemes and optimizations on performance,\nresilience and recovery time. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the\nfirst to discuss the persistence of security metadata in integrity-protected\nNVM systems and provide corresponding optimizations.

These\nportfolios, in the majority of cases, are characterized by an higher trade-off\nbetween performance and risk with respect to the traditional Global Minimum\nVariance (GMV) portfolio. Additionally, this methodology benefits of a\ngraphical visualization of the selected portfolio directly over the graphic\nlayout of the network, which helps in improving our understanding of the\noptimal strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 20:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

Accurate\nestimation of such parameter is critical in many applications that involve\nprior knowledge of the number of received signals. Information theo- retic\napproaches such as Akaikes information criterion (AIC) and minimum description\nlength (MDL) have been used extensively even though they are complex and show\nbad performance at some stages. In this paper, a new algorithm for estimating\nthe number of sources is presented. This algorithm exploits the estimated\neigenvalues of the auto correlation coefficient matrix rather than the auto\ncovariance matrix, which is conventionally used, to estimate the number of\nsources. We propose to use either of a two simply estimated decision\nstatistics, which are the moving increment and moving standard deviation as\nmetric to estimate the number of sources. Then process a simple calculation of\nthe increment or standard deviation of eigenvalues to find the number of\nsources at the location of the maximum value. Results showed that our proposed\nalgorithms have a better performance in comparison to the popular and more\ncomputationally expensive AIC and MDL at low SNR values and low number of\ncollected samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 18:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

In this paper, a NDA SNR\nestimation algorithm for QPSK signal is proposed. The proposed algorithm\nmodifies the existing Signal- to-Variation Ratio (SVR) SNR estimation algorithm\nin the aim to reduce its bias and mean square error in case of negative SNR\nvalues at low number of samples of it.

When\ndeploying network models on mobile devices with limited resources, weight\nquantization has been widely adopted. Binary quantization obtains the highest\ncompression but usually results in big accuracy drop. In practice, 8-bit or\n16-bit quantization is often used aiming at maintaining the same accuracy as\nthe original 32-bit precision. We observe different layers have different\naccuracy sensitivity of quantization. Thus judiciously selecting different\nprecision for different layers/structures can potentially produce more\nefficient models compared to traditional quantization methods by striking a\nbetter balance between accuracy and compression rate. In this work, we propose\na fine-grained quantization approach for deep neural network compression by\nrelaxing the search space of quantization bitwidth from discrete to a\ncontinuous domain. The proposed approach applies gradient descend based\noptimization to generate a mixed-precision quantization scheme that outperforms\nthe accuracy of traditional quantization methods under the same compression\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2018 21:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 08:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 04:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}
