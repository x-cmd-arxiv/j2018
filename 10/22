However, not every state policy reaches the national level.\nPrevious work has suggested that state-level policies are more likely to become\nnational policies depending on their geographic origin, their category of\nlegislation, or some characteristic of their initiating states, such as wealth,\nurbanicity, or ideological liberalism. Here, we tested these hypotheses by\ndivorcing the set of traits from the states' identities and building predictive\nforecasting models of state policies becoming national policies. Using a large,\nlongitudinal data set of state level policies and their traits, we train models\nto predict (i) whether policies become national policy, and (ii) how many\nstates must pass a given policy before it becomes national. Using these models\nas components, we then develop a logistic growth model to forecast when a\ncurrently spreading state-level policy is likely to pass at the national level.\nOur results indicate that traits of initiating states are not systematically\ncorrelated with becoming national policy and they predict neither how many\nstates must enact a policy before it becomes national nor whether it ultimately\nbecomes a national law. In contrast, the cumulative number of state-level\nadoptions of a policy is reasonably predictive of when a policy becomes\nnational. For the policies of same sex marriage and methamphetamine precursor\nlaws, we investigate how well the logistic growth model could forecast the\nprobable time horizon for true national action.

Mukhin, V. Tarasov, A. Varchenko.\n  We obtain a counting result for, equivalently, certain solutions of the Bethe\nansatz equation, certain fibers of the elliptic Wronski map, or ratios of theta\npolynomials, whose derivative is of a certain form. We give an asymptotic\nexpansion for Bethe eigenfunctions in a certain limit, and deduce from that\nthat the Weyl involution acting on Bethe eigenfunctions coincides with the\naction of an analytic involution given by the transposition of\ntheta-polynomials in the associated ordered pair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2018 18:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

While\nthese approaches provide state-of-the-art results, they are very expensive to\ncompute due to the multiway spatial join and scaling them to real-world\ndatasets is an open problem.

The PCA direction is a linear\ncombination of all features with nonzero loadings -- this impedes\ninterpretability. Sparse PCA (SPCA) is a framework that enhances\ninterpretability by incorporating an additional sparsity requirement in the\nfeature weights. However, unlike PCA, the SPCA problem is NP-hard. Most\nconventional methods for solving SPCA are heuristics with no guarantees, such\nas certificates of optimality on the solution-quality via associated dual\nbounds. Dual bounds are available via standard semidefinite programming (SDP)\nbased relaxations, which may not be tight, and the SDPs are difficult to scale\nby off-the-shelf solvers. In this paper, we present a convex integer\nprogramming (IP) framework to derive dual bounds. At the heart of our approach\nis the so-called $\\ell_1$-relaxation of SPCA. While the $\\ell_1$-relaxation\nleads to convex optimization problems for $\\ell_0$-sparse linear regression and\nrelatives, it results in a non-convex optimization problem for the PCA problem.\nWe first show that the $\\ell_1$-relaxation gives a tight multiplicative bound\non SPCA. Then we show how to use standard integer programming techniques to\nfurther relax the $\\ell_1$-relaxation into a convex IP. We present worst-case\nresults on the quality of the dual bound from the convex IP. We observe that\nthe dual bounds are significantly better than worst-case performance and are\nsuperior to the SDP bounds in some real-life instances. Moreover, solving the\nconvex IP model using commercial IP solvers appears to scale much better than\nsolving the SDP-relaxation using commercial solvers. To the best of our\nknowledge, we obtain the best dual bounds for real and artificial instances for\nSPCA problems involving covariance matrices of size up to $2000\\times 2000$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 02:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 20:03:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2021 14:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

We use current\npulses to set the perpendicular magnetization state which acts as the synapse\nweight, and demonstrate spintronic implementation of the excitatory/inhibitory\npostsynaptic potentials and spike timing-dependent plasticity. This\nfunctionality is made possible by the action of the in-plane interlayer\nexchange coupling field which leads to broadened, multi-state magnetic reversal\ncharacteristics. Numerical simulations, combined with investigations of a\nreference sample with a single perpendicular magnetized Pt/FM1/Ta structure,\nreveal that the broadening is due to the in-plane field component tuning the\nefficiency of the spin-orbit-torque to drive domain walls across a landscape of\nvarying pinning potentials. The conventionally binary FM1 inside our\nPt/FM1/Ta/FM2 structure with inherent in-plane coupling field is therefore\ntuned into a multi-state perpendicular ferromagnet and represents a synaptic\nemulator for neuromorphic computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 02:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

The\naccretion flow of a collapsing core on to the newly born neutron star suffers\nthe spiral standing accretion shock instability (SASI). This instability leads\nto a stochastically variable angular momentum of the accreted gas, that in turn\nforms an accretion flow with alternating directions of the angular momentum,\nhence alternating shear, at any given time. I study the shear in this\nalternating-shear sub-Keplerian inflow in published simulations, and present a\nnew comparison with Keplerian accretion disks. From that comparison I argue\nthat it might be as efficient as Keplerian accretion disks in amplifying\nmagnetic fields by a dynamo. I suggest that although the average specific\nangular momentum of the accretion flow is small, namely, sub-Keplerian, this\nalternating-shear accretion flow can launch jets with varying directions,\nnamely, jittering jets.

The proposal is as follows. The bursting and tonic\nmodes of firing patterns found in many neuron types in the brain correspond to\ntwo separate modes of information processing, with one mode resulting in\nawareness, and another mode being subliminal. In such a coding scheme, a neuron\nin bursting state codes for the highest level of perceptual abstraction\nrepresenting a pattern of sensory stimuli, or volitional abstraction\nrepresenting a pattern of muscle contraction sequences. Within the 50-250 ms\nminimum integration time of experience, the bursting neurons form synchrony\nensembles to allow for binding of related percepts. The degree which different\nbursting neurons can be merged into the same synchrony ensemble depends on the\nunderlying cortical connections that represent the degree of perceptual\nsimilarity. These synchrony ensembles compete for selective attention to remain\nactive. The dominant synchrony ensemble triggers episodic memory recall in the\nhippocampus, while forming new episodic memory with current sensory stimuli,\nresulting in a stream of thoughts. Neuromodulation modulates both top-down\nselection of synchrony ensembles, and memory formation. Episodic memory stored\nin the hippocampus is transferred to semantic and procedural memory in the\ncortex during rapid eye movement sleep, by updating cortical neuron synaptic\nweights with spike timing dependent plasticity. With the update of synaptic\nweights, new neurons become bursting while previous bursting neurons become\ntonic, allowing bursting neurons to move up to a higher level of perceptual\nabstraction. Finally, the proposed learning mechanism is compared with the\nback-propagation algorithm used in deep neural networks, and a proposal of how\nthe credit assignment problem can be addressed by the current proposal is\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 04:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

For large-scale SCUC, the Lagrangian relaxation\nmethods (LR) and the mixed integer programming methods (MIP) are most widely\nadopted. However, LR usually suffers from slow convergence; and the\ncomputational burden of MIP is heavy when the binary variable number is large.\nIn this paper, a variable reduction method is proposed: First, the time-coupled\nconstraints in the original SCUC problem are relaxed and many single-period\nSCUC problems (s-UC) are obtained. Second, LR is used to solve the s-UCs.\nDifferent from traditional LR with iterative subgradient method, it is found\nthat the optimal multipliers and the approximate UC solutions of s-UCs can be\nobtained by solving linear programs. Third, a criterion for choosing and fixing\nthe UC variables in the SCUC problem is established, hence the number of binary\nvariables is reduced.

It is based on the customary decomposition of the ion\nmotion in micro- and macro- (or secular) motions and a statistical treatment of\nhard-sphere collisions and ion trajectories. The model also relies on the\nevidence that the effective trapping area in real Paul traps is limited to a\ncertain radius, where the harmonics of the potential of order >2 become non\nnegligible. The model yields analytical formulae for the properties of the ion\ncloud and equilibration times, which are in good agreement for a wide range of\nparameters with the results of a numerical simulation, whose reliability has\nbeen verified with experimental observations.

In the present work,\nwe treat the massive case. On the one hand, one might rightfully expect that\nthe massive case is easier to handle since, in contrast to the massless case,\nthe corresponding Hamiltonian features a spectral gap. On the other hand, it\nturns out that the non-zero boson mass introduces a new complication as the\nspectrum of the complex dilated, free Hamiltonian exhibits lines of spectrum\nattached to every multiple of the boson rest mass energy starting from the\nground and excited state energies. This leads to an absence of decay of the\ncorresponding complex dilated resolvent close to the real line, which, in [14],\nwas a crucial ingredient to control the time evolution in the scattering\nregime. With the new strategy presented here, we provide a proof of an\nanalogous formula for the scattering kernel as compared to the massless case\nand use the opportunity to provide the required spectral information by a\nMourre theory argument combined with a suitable application of the\nFeshbach-Schur map instead of complex dilation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 08:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 07:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 08:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Generative\nmodels are widely viewed to be robust to such mistaken confidence as modeling\nthe density of the input features can be used to detect novel,\nout-of-distribution inputs. In this paper we challenge this assumption. We find\nthat the density learned by flow-based models, VAEs, and PixelCNNs cannot\ndistinguish images of common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.e.\nCIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.e. SVHN), assigning a higher\nlikelihood to the latter when the model is trained on the former. Moreover, we\nfind evidence of this phenomenon when pairing several popular image data sets:\nFashionMNIST vs MNIST, CelebA vs SVHN, ImageNet vs CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 / SVHN.\nTo investigate this curious behavior, we focus analysis on flow-based\ngenerative models in particular since they are trained and evaluated via the\nexact marginal likelihood. We find such behavior persists even when we restrict\nthe flows to constant-volume transformations. These transformations admit some\ntheoretical analysis, and we show that the difference in likelihoods can be\nexplained by the location and variances of the data and the model curvature.\nOur results caution against using the density estimates from deep generative\nmodels to identify inputs similar to the training distribution until their\nbehavior for out-of-distribution inputs is better understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 08:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 19:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 11:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

Millions of web users rely on filter\nlists to protect their privacy and improve their browsing experience.\n  Despite their importance, the growth and health of filter lists are poorly\nunderstood. Filter lists are maintained by a small number of contributors, who\nuse a variety of undocumented heuristics to determine what rules should be\nincluded. Lists quickly accumulate rules, and rules are rarely removed.

Mathematical models describing the auxin-related signalling\npathway, PIN and AUX1 dynamics, auxin transport, and cell growth in plant\ntissues are derived. A key assumption of our models is the regulation of PIN\nproteins by the auxin-responsive ARF-Aux/IAA signalling pathway, with\nupregulation of PIN biosynthesis by ARFs. Models are analysed and solved\nnumerically to examine the long-time behaviour and auxin distribution.

Within the traditional deep multi-task learning (DMTL)\nframework, this paper intends to fully exploit the correlations among different\nattributes by constructing a graph. The node in graph represents the feature\nvector from a particular branch for a given attribute, and the edge can be\ndefined by either the prior knowledge or the similarity between two nodes in\nthe embedding with a fully data-driven manner. We analyze that the attention\nmechanism actually takes effect in the latter case, and utilize the Graph\nAttention Layer (GAL) for exploring on the most relevant attribute feature and\nrefining the task-dependant feature by considering other attributes.\nExperiments show that by mining the correlations among attributes, our method\ncan improve the recognition accuracy on CelebA and LFWA dataset.

On the other hand, optimal\nMinimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimation would yield estimates which are the\n\"closest possible\" to the true sources, often at the cost of compromised ISR.\nIn this work, we consider noisy mixtures of temporally-diverse stationary\nGaussian sources in a semi-blind scenario, which conveniently lends itself to\neither one of these objectives. We begin by deriving the ML Estimates (MLEs) of\nthe unknown (deterministic) parameters of the model: the mixing matrix and the\n(possibly different) noise variances in each sensor. We derive the likelihood\nequations for these parameters, as well as the corresponding Cram\\'er-Rao lower\nbound, and propose an iterative solution for obtaining the MLEs.

We show that this estimate is asymptotically optimal and\nattains the (oracle) MMSE lower bound. Furthermore, for non-Gaussian signals,\nwe show that this estimate serves as a Quasi ML (QML)-based Linear MMSE (LMMSE)\nestimate, and attains the (oracle) LMMSE lower bound asymptotically.

The\npreservation and inheritance of cultural heritage is conducive to the progress\nof human civilization. In northwestern China, there is a world heritage site --\nMogao Grottoes -- that has a plenty of mural paintings showing the historical\ncultures of ancient China. To study these historical cultures, one critical\nprocedure is to date the mural paintings, i.e., determining the era when they\nwere created. Until now, most mural paintings at Mogao Grottoes have been dated\nby directly referring to the mural texts or historical documents. However, some\nare still left with creation-era undetermined due to the lack of reference\nmaterials. Considering that the drawing style of mural paintings was changing\nalong the history and the drawing style can be learned and quantified through\npainting data, we formulate the problem of mural-painting dating into a problem\nof drawing-style classification. In fact, drawing styles can be expressed not\nonly in color or curvature, but also in some unknown forms -- the forms that\nhave not been observed. To this end, besides sophisticated color and shape\ndescriptors, a deep convolution neural network is designed to encode the\nimplicit drawing styles. 3860 mural paintings collected from 194 different\ngrottoes with determined creation-era labels are used to train the\nclassification model and build the dating method.

Since time for prognostication is limited in a diagnostic\nsetting, the pathologist will often almost arbitrarily choose a certain field\nof interest assumed to have the highest mitotic activity. However, as mitotic\nfigures are commonly very sparse on the slide and often have a patchy\ndistribution, this poses a sampling problem which is known to be able to\ninfluence the tumor prognostication. On the other hand, automatic detection of\nmitotic figures can't yet be considered reliable enough for clinical\napplication. In order to aid the work of the human expert and at the same time\nreduce variance in tumor grading, it is beneficial to assess the whole slide\nimage (WSI) for the highest mitotic activity and use this as a reference region\nfor human counting. For this task, we compare two methods for region of\ninterest proposal, both based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). For both\napproaches, the CNN performs a segmentation of the WSI to assess mitotic\nactivity.

This class of molecules is also pivotal for the determination\nof important physical parameters for the ISM evolution (e.g. gas ionisation\nfraction) or as tracers of non-polar, hence not directly observable, species.\nThe identification of these molecular species through radioastronomical\nobservations is directly linked to a precise laboratory spectral\ncharacterisation. The goal of the present work is to extend the laboratory\nmeasurements of the pure rotational spectrum of the ground electronic state of\nprotonated carbonyl sulfide (HSCO$^+$) and its deuterium substituted isotopomer\n(DSCO$^+$). At the same time, we show how implementing different laboratory\ntechniques allows the determination of different spectroscopical properties of\nasymmetric-top protonated species. Three different high-resolution experiments\nwere involved to detected for the first time the $b-$type rotational spectrum\nof HSCO$^+$, and to extend, well into the sub-millimeter region, the $a-$type\nspectrum of the same molecular species and DSCO$^+$. The electronic\nground-state of both ions have been investigated in the 273-405 GHz frequency\nrange, allowing the detection of 60 and 50 new rotational transitions for\nHSCO$^+$ and DSCO$^+$, respectively. The combination of our new measurements\nwith the three rotational transitions previously observed in the microwave\nregion permits the rest frequencies of the astronomically most relevant\ntransitions to be predicted to better than 100 kHz for both HSCO$^+$ and\nDSCO$^+$ up to 500 GHz, equivalent to better than 60 m/s in terms of equivalent\nradial velocity. The present work illustrates the importance of using different\nlaboratory techniques to spectroscopically characterise a protonated species at\nhigh frequency, and how a similar approach can be adopted when dealing with\nreactive species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 12:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

The presence of a 110 kpc long HI tail in the S\ndirection indicates that this galaxy is undergoing a ram pressure stripping\nevent. The deep narrow-band image revealed the presence of a low surface\nbrightness ionised gas tail ~10 kpc long extending from the centre of the\ngalaxy to the NW direction, in the direction opposite to the HI tail. Chandra\nand XMM X-rays data do not show any compact source in the nucleus nor the\npresence of an extended tail of hot gas, while MUSE spectroscopy indicates that\nthe gas is photo-ionised in the inner regions and shock-ionised in the outer\nparts. IFU spectroscopy confirms that the ionised gas is kinematically\ndecoupled from the stellar component and indicates the presence of two\nkinematically distinct structures in the stellar disc. The analysis of the SED\nof the galaxy indicates that the activity of star formation has been totally\nquenched in the outer disc ~ 250-280 Myr ago, while only reduced by ~80% in the\ncentral regions. All this observational evidence suggests that NGC 4424 is the\nremnant of an unequal-mass merger occurred <= 500 Myr ago, when the galaxy was\nalready a member of the Virgo cluster, now undergoing a ram pressure stripping\nevent which has removed the gas and quenched the activity of star formation in\nthe outer disc. The tail of ionised gas probably results from the outflow\nproduced by a central starburst fed by the collapse of gas induced by the\nmerging episode. This outflow is sufficiently powerful to overcome the ram\npressure induced by the intracluster medium on the disc of the galaxy crossing\nthe cluster. This analysis thus suggests that feedback can participate in the\nquenching process of galaxies in high-density regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 13:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Classic approaches to program HRI from observed\nhuman-human interactions fails to capture the subtlety of multimodal\ninteractions as well as the key structural differences between robots and\nhumans. The former arises due to a difficulty in quantifying and coding\nmultimodal behaviours, while the latter due to a difference of the degrees of\nliberty between a robot and a human. However, the notion of reverse engineering\nfrom multimodal HRI traces to learn the underlying behavioral blueprint of the\nrobot given multimodal traces seems an option worth exploring. With this\nspirit, the entire HRI can be seen as a sequence of exchanges of speech acts\nbetween the robot and human, each act treated as an action, bearing in mind\nthat the entire sequence is goal-driven. Thus, this entire interaction can be\ntreated as a sequence of actions propelling the interaction from its initial to\ngoal state, also known as a plan in the domain of AI planning. In the same\ndomain, this action sequence that stems from plan execution can be represented\nas a trace. AI techniques, such as machine learning, can be used to learn\nbehavioral models (also known as symbolic action models in AI), intended to be\nreusable for AI planning, from the aforementioned multimodal traces. This\narticle reviews recent machine learning techniques for learning planning action\nmodels which can be applied to the field of HRI with the intent of rendering\nrobots as socio-communicative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 13:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

The\nreason for steady changes of the period could be the mass transfer (the flow of\nmatter) between components of these stellar systems.

While this is good theoretical progress, the entire MASO approach is\npredicated on the requirement that the nonlinearities be piecewise affine and\nconvex, which precludes important activation functions like the sigmoid,\nhyperbolic tangent, and softmax. {\\em This paper extends the MASO framework to\nthese and an infinitely large class of new nonlinearities by linking\ndeterministic MASOs with probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).} We show\nthat, under a GMM, piecewise affine, convex nonlinearities like ReLU, absolute\nvalue, and max-pooling can be interpreted as solutions to certain natural\n\"hard\" VQ inference problems, while sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and softmax\ncan be interpreted as solutions to corresponding \"soft\" VQ inference problems.\nWe further extend the framework by hybridizing the hard and soft VQ\noptimizations to create a $\\beta$-VQ inference that interpolates between hard,\nsoft, and linear VQ inference. A prime example of a $\\beta$-VQ DN nonlinearity\nis the {\\em swish} nonlinearity, which offers state-of-the-art performance in a\nrange of computer vision tasks but was developed ad hoc by experimentation.\nFinally, we validate with experiments an important assertion of our theory,\nnamely that DN performance can be significantly improved by enforcing\northogonality in its linear filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 13:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

The present model utilizes two LB evolution equations,\none of which is used to solve fluid interface, and another is adopted to solve\nhydrodynamic properties. To simulate axisymmetric multiphase flows effectively,\nthe appropriate source term and equilibrium distribution function are\nintroduced into the LB equation for interface tracking, and simultaneously, a\nsimple and efficient forcing distribution function is also delicately designed\nin the LB equation for hydrodynamic properties.

Canopus is a scalable distributed\nconsensus protocol that ensures that live nodes in a system agree on an ordered\nsequence of operations (called transactions). Unlike most prior consensus\nprotocols, Canopus does not rely on a single leader. Instead, it uses a virtual\ntree overlay for message dissemination to limit network traffic across\noversubscribed links. It leverages hardware redundancies, both within a rack\nand inside the network fabric, to reduce both protocol complexity and\ncommunication overhead. These design decisions enable Canopus to support large\ndeployments without significant performance degradation.\n  The existing Canopus protocol is resilient in the face of node and\ncommunication failures, but its focus is primarily on performance, so does not\nrespond well to other types of failures. For example, the failure of a single\nrack of servers causes all live nodes to stall.

With the\ndiffusion-reacceleration model, we consider two schemes to reproduce the\nhardening in the spectra: (i) A high-rigidity break in primary source\ninjection; (ii) A high-rigidity break in diffusion coefficient. The global\nfitting results show that both schemes could reproduce the spectra hardening in\ncurrent status. More precise multi-TV data (especially the data of secondary CR\nspecies) is needed if one wants to distinguish these two schemes. In our global\nfitting, each of the nuclei species is allocated an independent solar\nmodulation potential and a re-scale factor (which accounts for the isotopic\nabundance for primary nuclei species and uncertainties of production cross\nsection or inhomogeneity of CR sources and propagation for secondary nuclei\nspecies). The fitting values of these two parameter classes show us some hints\non some new directions in CR physics. All the fitted re-scale factors of\nprimary nuclei species have values that systematically smaller than 1.0, while\nthat of secondary nuclei species are systematically larger than 1.0. Moreover,\nboth the re-scale factor and solar modulation potential of beryllium have\nvalues which are obviously different from other species.

It is\nshown that under suitable parameter regime, the ion-drag force may balance the\ncombined electrostatic and gravitational force on the dust particles owing to\nits hollow profile as one moves away from the surface. Our analysis shows that\nthe parameter regimes in which such a situation may result is realizable in\nlaboratory and space plasma environments, particularly the near-surface dayside\nlunar plasma. The lunar surface and dust grains are electrostatically charged\ndue to the interaction with the solar wind plasma environment and the\nphotoemission of electrons due to solar UV radiation. This results in a process\nthat charges the surface positively and generates a near-surface photoelectron\ninverse plasma sheath. The potential structure changes from a monotonic\nclassical sheath to an inverse sheath as the emitted electron density becomes\nlarger than the plasma electron density. In a relatively newer, recently\ndeveloped charging model, called the Patched Charge Model, it has shown both\ntheoretically and experimentally that even in photoelectron-rich environment,\ndust particles lying on a regolith surface can attain large negative potential\ndue to formation of micro cavities. This negative potential may reach such\nvalues so that dust mobilization and lofting may become possible. In our work,\nwe have assumed the existence of such negatively charged dust particles in a\nphotoelectron-rich environment and argue that once the dust lofting is\neffected, the levitation can be sustained through the ion-drag force. The\nconditions of levitation are investigated for these dust particles and the\nlevitation distances from the lunar surface are calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 14:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Their numerical\nefficiency for such problems has been theoretically confirmed in\n\\cite{BCDDPW,DPW}, where it is shown that the reduced basis space $V_n$ of\ndimension $n$, constructed by a certain greedy strategy, has approximation\nerror similar to that of the optimal space associated to the Kolmogorov\n$n$-width of the solution manifold. The greedy construction of the reduced\nbasis space is performed in an offline stage which requires at each step a\nmaximization of the current error over the parameter space. For the purpose of\nnumerical computation, this maximization is performed over a finite {\\em\ntraining set} obtained through a discretization. of the parameter domain. To\nguarantee a final approximation error $\\varepsilon$ for the space generated by\nthe greedy algorithm requires in principle that the snapshots associated to\nthis training set constitute an approximation net for the solution manifold\nwith accuracy or order $\\varepsilon$. Hence, the size of the training set is\nthe $\\varepsilon$ covering number for $\\mathcal{M}$ and this covering number\ntypically behaves like $\\exp(C\\varepsilon^{-1/s})$ for some $C>0$ when the\nsolution manifold has $n$-width decay $O(n^{-s})$.

SM ensures\nstrong data consistency by maintaining multiple exact data replicas and\nsynchronously propagating every update to all of them. Such strong consistency\nprovides fault tolerance guarantees and a simple programming model coveted by\nenterprise system designers. For current storage devices, SM comes at modest\nperformance overheads. This is because performing both local and remote updates\nsimultaneously is only marginally slower than performing just local updates,\ndue to the relatively slow performance of accesses to storage in today's\nsystems. However, emerging persistent memory and ultra-low-latency network\ntechnologies necessitate a careful re-evaluation of the existing SM techniques,\nas these technologies present fundamentally different latency characteristics\ncompared than their traditional counterparts. In addition to that, existing\nlow-latency network technologies, such as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA),\nprovide limited ordering guarantees and do not provide durability guarantees\nnecessary for SM. To evaluate the performance implications of RDMA-based SM, we\ndevelop a rigorous testing framework that is based on emulated persistent\nmemory. Our testing framework makes use of two different tools: (i) a\nconfigurable microbenchmark and (ii) a modified version of the WHISPER\nbenchmark suite, which comprises a set of common cloud applications. Using this\nframework, we find that recently proposed RDMA primitives, such as remote\ncommit, provide correctness guarantees, but do not take full advantage of the\nasynchronous nature of RDMA hardware. To this end, we propose new primitives\nenabling efficient and correct SM over RDMA, and use these primitives to\ndevelop two new techniques delivering high-performance SM of persistent\nmemories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 15:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

In addition to the SU(2) representations encoding the\ngeometrical flux, the bubble network links carry a compatible SL(2,R)\nrepresentation encoding the discretized frame field which composes the flux. In\ncontrast with twisted geometries, this extra data allows to reconstruct the\nframe compatible with the flux unambiguously.

However to the best of our knowledge current commercial\noperating systems are not optimized for multi-threaded workloads running on\nsuch servers. Cache-to-cache transfers and remote memory accesses impact the\nperformance of such workloads. This paper presents a unified approach to\noptimizing OS scheduling algorithms for both cache-to-cache transfers and\nremote DRAM accesses that also takes cache affinity into account. By observing\nthe patterns of local and remote cache-to-cache transfers as well as local and\nremote DRAM accesses for every thread in each scheduling quantum and applying\ndifferent algorithms, we come up with a new schedule of threads for the next\nquantum taking cache affinity into account. This new schedule cuts down both\nremote cache-to-cache transfers and remote DRAM accesses for the next\nscheduling quantum and improves overall performance. We present two algorithms\nof varying complexity for optimizing cache-to-cache transfers. One of these is\na new algorithm which is relatively simpler and performs better when combined\nwith algorithms that optimize remote DRAM accesses. For optimizing remote DRAM\naccesses we present two algorithms. Though both algorithms differ in\nalgorithmic complexity we find that for our workloads they perform equally\nwell. We used three different synthetic workloads to evaluate these algorithms.\nWe also performed sensitivity analysis with respect to varying remote\ncache-to-cache transfer latency and remote DRAM latency. We show that these\nalgorithms can cut down overall latency by up to 16.79% depending on the\nalgorithm used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2018 18:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

A sudden failure of a power transformer can\nsignificantly disrupt bulk power delivery. Before a transformer reaches its\ncritical failure state, there are indicators which, if monitored periodically,\ncan alert an operator that the transformer is heading towards a failure. One of\nthe indicators is the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the voltage and current\nsignals in substations located in the vicinity of the transformer. During\nnormal operations, the width of the SNR band is small. However, when the\ntransformer heads towards a failure, the widths of the bands increase, reaching\ntheir maximum just before the failure actually occurs.

Among\nthese techniques, HTN ({\\it Hierarchical Task Network}) planning is one of the\nmost used in practice. Unlike classical approaches of planning. HTN operates by\ndecomposing task into sub-tasks until each of these sub-tasks can be achieved\nan action. This hierarchical representation provide a richer representation of\nplanning problems and allows to better guide the plan search and provides more\nknowledge to the underlying algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach of HTN planning in which, as in conventional planning, we instantiate\nall planning operators before starting the search process. This approach has\nproven its effectiveness in classical planning and is necessary for the\ndevelopment of effective heuristics and encoding planning problems in other\nformalism such as CSP or SAT. The instantiation is actually used by most modern\nplanners but has never been applied in an HTN based planning framework.

Thus, appropriate decoupling\nbetween transmit and receive coils is required. In this study, two controllable\ndecoupling designs are investigated for achieving isolation between coils.\nMethods: A modified version of isolation concept used in the full-duplex radios\nin communication systems is applied to acquire MRI signal using CEA. In our new\nmethod, a small copy of RF transmit signal is attenuated and delayed to\ngenerate the same coupling signal which is available in the receiver coil. Then\nit is subtracted from the receive signal to detect the MRI signal. The proposed\ndecoupling method is developed and implemented in two designs: Semi-Automatic\nand Fully-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Designs. Results: Using\nSemi-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Design, decoupling of more than 75 dB is\nachieved. Fully-Automatic Controllable Decoupling Design provides more than 100\ndB decoupling between coils which is good enough for detecting MRI signals\nduring excitation from tissues with very short transverse relaxation time.\nConclusion: This study shows feasibility of applying full duplex electronics to\ndecouple transmit and receive coils for CEA in a clinical MRI system.\nSignificance: These designs can automatically tune the cancellation circuit and\nit is a potential tool for recovering signal from tissues with very short T2 in\nclinical MR systems with a minor hardware modification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 02:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

The energy optimization via\nthe Variation Principle can be made with a Lagrange multiplier method to keep\nthe ortho-normal property and the Newton-Raphson (NR) method to find the\nfunction minimum. It is an alternative to the widely applied HF self consistent\nfield (HF-SCF) method which is based on unitary transformations and eigensolver\nduring the SCF, and seems to have more convenient convergence property. This\nmethod is demonstrated for closed shell (even number of electrons and all MO\nare occupied with both, alpha and beta spin electrons) and restricted (all MOs\nhave single individual spatial orbital), but the extension of the method to\nopen shell and/or unrestricted cases is straightforward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 13:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}
