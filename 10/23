In this paper, we propose a novel RNN model for NLI and\nempirically evaluate the effect of applying dropout at different layers in the\nmodel. We also investigate the impact of varying dropout rates at these layers.\nOur empirical evaluation on a large (Stanford Natural Language Inference\n(SNLI)) and a small (SciTail) dataset suggest that dropout at each feed-forward\nconnection severely affects the model accuracy at increasing dropout rates. We\nalso show that regularizing the embedding layer is efficient for SNLI whereas\nregularizing the recurrent layer improves the accuracy for SciTail. Our model\nachieved an accuracy 86.14% on the SNLI dataset and 77.05% on SciTail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 17:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-23"}

Observations of 3He+ in HII regions located\nthroughout the Milky Way disk reveal very little variation in the 3He/H\nabundance ratio---the \"3He Plateau\"---indicating that the net effect of 3He\nproduction in stars is negligible. This is in contrast to much higher 3He/H\nabundance ratios found in some planetary nebulae. This discrepancy is known as\nthe \"3He Problem\". Stellar evolution models that include thermohaline mixing\ncan resolve the 3He Problem by drastically reducing the net 3He production in\nmost stars. These models predict a small negative 3He/H abundance gradient\nacross the Galactic disk. Here we use the Green Bank Telescope to observe 3He+\nin five HII regions with high accuracy to confirm the predictions of stellar\nand Galactic chemical evolution models that include thermohaline mixing.

Calculating excited states is, in general, a more\ndifficult task than finding ground states for classical computers. To extend\nthe framework to excited states, we here propose an algorithm, the\nsubspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE). This algorithm\nsearches a low energy subspace by supplying orthogonal input states to the\nvariational ansatz and relies on the unitarity of transformations to ensure the\northogonality of output states. The $k$-th excited state is obtained as the\nhighest energy state in the low energy subspace. The proposed algorithm\nconsists only of two parameter optimization procedures and does not employ any\nancilla qubits. The disuse of the ancilla qubits is a great improvement from\nthe existing proposals for excited states, which have utilized the swap test,\nmaking our proposal a truly near-term quantum algorithm. We further generalize\nthe SSVQE to obtain all excited states up to the $k$-th by only a single\noptimization procedure. From numerical simulations, we verify the proposed\nalgorithms.

In a distant frame, semiclassical theory in the zone\ndescribes microscopic dynamics of only the \"hard modes,\" the modes that are\nhard enough to be discriminated in the timescale of Hawking emission. The\nthermal nature of these modes arises from microcanonical typicality of the full\nblack hole degrees of freedom, mostly composed of the \"soft modes,\" the modes\nthat cannot be discriminated at the semiclassical level. The hard modes are\npurified by a combined system of the soft modes and early Hawking radiation,\nbut not by either of them separately. This intrinsically tripartite structure\nof entanglement is general, regardless of the age of the black hole. The\ninterior spacetime emerges only at a coarse-grained level. To describe it, an\neffective theory can be erected at each time, which applies only to a limited\nspacetime region determined by the time at which the theory is erected. The\nentire interior of the black hole can be described only using multiple\neffective theories erected at different times, realizing the idea of\ncomplementarity. We analyze implications of the entanglement structure\ndescribed here for various phenomena, including Hawking evaporation and general\ninformation retrieval. For multiple entangled black holes, it implies that\nsemiclassical objects dropped into different black holes cannot meet in the\ninterior, although each object smoothly enters the horizon of the black hole to\nwhich it is falling.

The interaction of the binary components during the CE\nevolution (CEE) stage gives rise to orbital inspiral and the formation of a\nshort-period binary or a merger, on the expense of extending and/or ejecting\nthe envelope. CEE is not well understood, as hydrodynamical simulations show\nthat only a fraction of the CE-mass is ejected during the dynamical inspiral,\nin contrast with observations of post-CE binaries. Different CE models suggest\ndifferent timescales are involved in the CE-ejection, and hence a measurement\nof the CE-ejection timescale could provide direct constraints on the\nCEE-process. Here we propose a novel method for constraining the mass-loss\ntimescale of the CE, using post-CE binaries which are part of wide-orbit triple\nsystems. The orbit/existence of a third companion constrains the CE mass-loss\ntimescale, since rapid CE mass-loss may disrupt the triple system, while slower\nCE mass-loss may change the orbit of the third companion without disrupting it.\nAs first test-cases we examine two observed post-CE binaries in wide triples,\nWolf-1130 and GD-319. We follow their evolution due to mass-loss using analytic\nand numerical tools, and consider different mass-loss functions. We calculate a\nwide grid of binary parameters and mass-loss timescales in order to determine\nthe most probable mass-loss timescale leading to the observed properties of the\nsystems. We find that mass-loss timescales of the order of $10^{3}-10^{5}{\\rm\nyr}$ are the most likely to explain these systems. Such long timescales are in\ntension with most of the CE mass-loss models, which predict shorter, dynamical\ntimescales, but are potentially consistent with the longer timescales expected\nfrom the dust-driven winds model for CE ejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

The system is\ndescribed by a superfluid mixture consisting of two distinguishable states with\na small energy gap, such as the ground state and an excited state of dark\nmatter. Given their contact in the superfluid, interaction between those states\ncan happen, converting one state into the other. This long range interaction\nwithin the superfluid couples the two superfluid phonon species through a\ncosine potential motivated by Josephson/Rabi interactions. As a consequence of\nthis potential, a new dynamics of late-time accelerated expansion emerges in\nthis system, without the need of dark energy, coming from a universe containing\nonly this two-state DM superfluid. Because the superfluid species are\nnon-relativistic, their sound speeds remain suitably small throughout the\nevolution. We calculate the expansion history and growth of linear\nperturbations, and compare the results to $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For the\nfiducial parameters studied here, the predicted expansion and growth function\nare close to those of $\\Lambda$CDM, but the difference in the predicted growth\nrate is significant at late times.

One such design consists of vertically\nstacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM) and using the\nspin-mixing properties of \"molecule-like\" coupled hole states for all-optical\nqubit manipulation. In this article, the first of two papers, we introduce the\nincorporation of dilute GaBiAs alloys in the barrier region between the two\ndots. GaBiAs is expected to increase the spin-mixing of the molecular states\nneeded for qubit operations by raising the barrier valence band edge and\nspin-orbit splitting. Using an atomistic tight-binding model, we compute the\nproperties of GaBiAs and the modification of hole states that arise when the\nalloy is used in the barrier of an InAs QDM. An atomistic treatment is\nnecessary to correctly capture non-traditional alloy effects such as the\nband-anticrossing valence band. It also allows for the study of configurational\nvariances and clustering effects of the alloy. We find that in InAs QDMs with a\nGaBiAs interdot barrier, electron states are not strongly affected by the\ninclusion of Bi. However, hole states are much more sensitive to the presence\nand configuration of Bi in the barriers. By independently studying the\nalloy-induced strain and electronic scattering off Bi and As orbitals, we\nconclude that an initial increase in QDM hole state energy at low Bi\nconcentration is caused by the alloy-induced strain. We further find that the\ndecrease in QDM hole energy at higher Bi concentrations can only be explained\nwhen both alloy strain and orbital effects are considered. In our second\narticle, we use the understanding developed here to discuss how the alloyed\nbarriers contribute to enhancement in hole spin-mixing and the implications for\nQDM qubit architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 18:10:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 18:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The short GNR segments are directly written in\nthe ribbon with an STM tip to form atomic precision intraribbon\nheterostructures. Based on STM studies combined with density functional theory\ncalculations, we show that the heterostructure has a type-I band alignment,\nwith manifestations of quantum confinement and orbital hybridization. Our\nfinding demonstrates a feasible strategy to create a double barrier quantum dot\nstructure with atomic precision for novel functionalities, such as negative\ndifferential resistance devices in GNR-based nanoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 18:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Some possible\nsignatures of these excitations have been reported as zero bias peaks at\nendpoints of one-dimensional semiconducting wires and magnetic chains. However,\n1D systems are by nature fragile to a small amount of disorder that induces\nlow-energy excitations, hence obtaining Majorana zero modes well isolated in a\nhard gap requires extremely clean systems. Two-dimensional systems offer an\nalternative route to get robust Majorana zero modes. Indeed, it was shown\nrecently that Pb/Co/Si(111) could be used as a platform for generating 2D\ntopological superconductivity with a strong immunity to local disorder. While\n2D systems exhibit dispersive chiral edge states, they can also host Majorana\nzero modes located on local topological defects.

Bridging\noccurs under the balance of the hydrodynamic force exerted from the fluid on\nthe particles and the friction force exerted from the walls on the particles.\nThe 3D motion of particles in fluid is analyzed by means of direct numerical\nsimulation.

Finally, to understand the root cause of a\ndetected vulnerability, we design an attribution mechanism to identify\nproblematic and potentially malicious apps. We evaluate IoTSan on the Samsung\nSmartThings platform. From 76 manually configured systems, IoTSan detects 147\nvulnerabilities.

These code\ncaches, along with the associated profiling data for the hot code, however,\nconsume significant amounts of memory. Furthermore, they incur extra JIT\ncompilation time for their creation. On Android, the current standard JIT\ncompiler and its code caches are not shared among processes---that is, the\nruntime system maintains a private code cache, and its associated data, for\neach runtime process. However, applications running on the same platform tend\nto share multiple libraries in common. Sharing cached code across multiple\napplications and multiple processes can lead to a reduction in memory use. It\ncan directly reduce compile time. It can also reduce the cumulative amount of\ntime spent interpreting code. All three of these effects can improve actual\nruntime performance.\n  In this paper, we describe ShareJIT, a global code cache for JITs that can\nshare code across multiple applications and multiple processes. We implemented\nShareJIT in the context of the Android Runtime (ART), a widely used,\nstate-of-the-art system. To increase sharing, our implementation constrains the\namount of context that the JIT compiler can use to optimize the code. This\nexposes a fundamental tradeoff: increased specialization to a single process'\ncontext decreases the extent to which the compiled code can be shared. In\nShareJIT, we limit some optimization to increase shareability. To evaluate the\nShareJIT, we tested 8 popular Android apps in a total of 30 experiments.\nShareJIT improved overall performance by 9% on average, while decreasing memory\nconsumption by 16% on average and JIT compilation time by 37% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 21:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Often,\nintravascular optical coherence tomography is used to assess potential\nmalapposition after implantation and for follow-up examinations later on.\nTypically, the scaffold is manually reviewed by an expert, analyzing each of\nthe hundreds of image slices. As this is time consuming, automatic stent\ndetection and visualization approaches have been proposed, mostly for metal\nstent detection based on classic image processing. As bioresorbable scaffolds\nare harder to detect, recent approaches have used feature extraction and\nmachine learning methods for automatic detection. However, these methods\nrequire detailed, pixel-level labels in each image slice and extensive feature\nengineering for the particular stent type which might limit the approaches'\ngeneralization capabilities. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based method\nfor bioresorbable scaffold visualization using only image-level labels. A\nconvolutional neural network is trained to predict whether an image slice\ncontains a metal stent, a bioresorbable scaffold, or no device. Then, we derive\nlocal stent strut information by employing weakly supervised localization using\nsaliency maps with guided backpropagation.

Thus, there is a need to develop quantitative\ntheories of QED phenomena in complex electronic and photonic systems. In this\nLetter, we develop a variational theory of general non-relativistic QED systems\nof coupled light and matter. Essential to our ansatz is the notion of an\neffective photonic vacuum whose modes are different than the modes in the\nabsence of light-matter coupling. This variational formulation leads to a set\nof general equations that can describe the ground state of multi-electron\nsystems coupled to many photonic modes in real space. As a first step towards a\nnew ab initio approach to ground and excited state energies in QED, we apply\nour ansatz to describe a multi-level emitter coupled to many optical modes, a\nsystem with no analytical solution. We find a compact semi-analytical formula\nwhich describes ground and excited state energies to less than 1% error in all\nregimes of coupling parameters allowed by sum rules. Additionally, our\nformulation provides essentially a non-perturbative theory of Lamb shifts and\nCasimir-Polder forces, as well as suggesting new physical concepts such as the\nCasimir energy of a single atom in a cavity. Our method should give rise to\nhighly accurate descriptions of phenomena in general QED systems, such as\nCasimir forces, Lamb shifts, spontaneous emission, and other fluctuational\nelectrodynamical effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 23:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

We calculate the\nmalleability with respect to specific measurements of the involved topologies.\nMore specifically, we identify the possible topologies derivable from a given\nconfiguration and calculate some topological measurement of them (e.g.\nclustering coefficient, shortest path length, assortativity, etc.), leading to\nrespective probabilities being associated to each possible measurement value.\nThough this approach implies some level of degeneracy in the mapping from\ntopology to measurement space, it still paves the way to inferring the\nmalleability of specific network types with respect to given topological\nmeasurements. We report that the malleability, in general, depends on each\nspecific measurement, with the average shortest path length and degree\nassortativity typically leading to large malleability values.

Based on our recent {\\it\nChandra} survey of Galactic globular clusters (GCs), we revisit the role of\nstellar dynamical interactions in GCs, focusing on main-sequence (MS) binary\nencounters as a potential formation channel of the observed X-ray sources in\nGCs. We show that the cumulative X-ray luminosity ($L_X$), a proxy of the total\nnumber of X-ray-emitting binaries (primarily cataclysmic variables and\ncoronally active binaries) in a given GC, is highly correlated with the MS\nbinary encounter rate ($\\Gamma_{b}$), as $L_X \\propto\n\\Gamma_{b}^{0.77\\pm0.11}$.

We\ndemonstrate that the binary hardness ratio of most GCs is larger than that of\nthe Solar neighborbood stars, and exhibits a positive correlation with the\ncluster specific encounter rate ($\\gamma$), as $L_{X}/(L_{K}f_{b}) \\propto\n\\gamma^{0.65\\pm0.12}$.

Under large temperature\ndifference, the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is essentially\nmultiscale, not only in the frequency space, but also in the spatial space. In\norder to realize the efficient coupling of the multiscale phonon transport, the\nphonon scattering and advection are coupled together in the present scheme on\nthe reconstruction of the distribution function at the cell interface. The\nNewtonian method is adopted to solve the nonlinear scattering term for the\nupdate of the temperature at both the cell center and interface. In addition,\nthe energy at the cell center is updated by a macroscopic equation instead of\ntaking the moment of the distribution function, which enhances the numerical\nconservation. Numerical results of the cross-plane heat transfer prove that the\npresent scheme can describe the multiscale heat transfer phenomena accurately\nwith arbitrary temperature difference in a wide range. In the diffusive regime,\neven if the time step is larger than the relaxation time, the present scheme\ncan capture the transient thermal transport process accurately.

Such distances are typically defined as comparisons\nbetween metric measure space invariants, such as distance distributions (also\nreferred to as shape distributions, distance histograms or shape contexts in\nthe literature). Generally, distances defined in terms of distance\ndistributions are actually pseudometrics, in that they may vanish when\ncomparing nonisomorphic spaces.

Recently,\nlow-cost and portable 3D acquisition techniques like ToF(Time of Flight) and\nDoE based structured light systems enable us to access 3D data easily, e.g.,\nvia a mobile phone. However, such devices only provide sparse(limited speckles\nin structured light system) and noisy 3D data which can not support face\nrecognition directly. In this paper, we aim at achieving high-performance face\nrecognition for devices equipped with such modules which is very meaningful in\npractice as such devices will be very popular. We propose a framework to\nperform face recognition by fusing a sequence of low-quality 3D data. As 3D\ndata are sparse and noisy which can not be well handled by conventional methods\nlike the ICP algorithm, we design a PointNet-like Deep Registration\nNetwork(DRNet) which works with ordered 3D point coordinates while preserving\nthe ability of mining local structures via convolution. Meanwhile we develop a\nnovel loss function to optimize our DRNet based on the quaternion expression\nwhich obviously outperforms other widely used functions. For face recognition,\nwe design a deep convolutional network which takes the fused 3D depth-map as\ninput based on AMSoftmax model. Experiments show that our DRNet can achieve\nrotation error 0.95{\\deg} and translation error 0.28mm for registration.

With HWI, the capacity as well as the utility of\nsurface-area are both degraded, due to a higher effective noise level caused by\nthe HWI.

Its origin can be traced back to social\nsciences and led to ranking algorithms based on graph theoretic centralities.\nCoupled dynamical systems differ from social networks in that, they are\ncharacterized by degrees of freedom with a deterministic dynamics and the\ncoupling between individual units is a well-defined function of those degrees\nof freedom. One therefore expects the resulting coupled dynamics, and not only\nthe network topology, to also determine the key players. Here, we investigate\nsynchronizable network-coupled dynamical systems such as high voltage electric\npower grids and coupled oscillators. We search for nodes which, once perturbed\nby a local noisy disturbance, generate the largest overall transient excursion\naway from synchrony. A spectral decomposition of the coupling matrix leads to\nan elegant, concise, yet accurate solution to this identification problem. We\nshow that, when the internodal coupling matrix is Laplacian, these key players\nare peripheral in the sense of a centrality measure defined from effective\nresistance distances. For linearly coupled dynamical systems such as weakly\nloaded power grids or consensus algorithms, the nodal ranking is efficiently\nobtained through a single Laplacian matrix inversion, regardless of the\noperational synchronous state. We call the resulting ranking index LRank. For\nheavily loaded power grids or coupled oscillators systems closer to the\ntransition to synchrony, nonlinearities render the nodal ranking dependent on\nthe synchronous state. In this case a weighted Laplacian matrix inversion gives\nanother ranking index, which we call WLRank. Quite surprisingly, we find that\nLRank provides a faithful ranking even for well developed coupling\nnonlinearities, corresponding to oscillator angle differences up to $40^o$\napproximately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

The spectro-photometric signal is not affected\nonly by image movement and deformation due to wavefront error but also by\nelectrical variation in the detector system. These time-variation components,\ncoupled to the transit signal, distort the measurements of atmospheric\ncomposition in transit spectroscopy. Here we propose a new concept for\nimprovement of spectro-photometric accuracy through the calibration of the\ntime-variation components in the detector system by developing densified pupil\nspectroscopy that provides multiple spectra of the star-planet system. Owing to\na group of pixels exposed by the object light (i.e., science pixels),\npixel-to-pixel variations can be smoothed out through an averaging operation,\nthus only common time-variation components over the science pixels remain. In\naddition, considering that the detector plane is optically conjugated to the\npupil plane, a pupil mask can completely block astronomical light incoming into\nresidual pixels. The common time-variation components are reconstructed with\nthe residual pixels and reduced into a random term. Applying the densified\npupil spectrograph with a mid-infrared detector system to a large space\ncryogenic telescope such as the Origins Space Telescope, we show that the\nsystem nearly achieves photon-noise-limited performance and detects absorption\nfeatures through transmission spectroscopy and secondary eclipse of terrestrial\nplanets orbiting M-type stars at 10 pc with 60 transit observations.

The edge states of quantum\nspin Hall (QSH) systems, i.e. two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators\nrealized in HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb quantum wells, may turn the tide in the\nfield, as they do not require the magnetic field that limits the\nimplementations based on quantum Hall effect. Here we show that an electric\npulse, localized in space and/or time and applied at a QSH edge, can\nphotoexcite electron wavepackets by intra-branch electrical transitions,\nwithout invoking the bulk states or the Zeeman coupling. Such wavepackets are\nspin-polarised and propagate in opposite directions, with a density profile\nthat is independent of the initial equilibrium temperature and that does not\nexhibit dispersion, as a result of the linearity of the spectrum and of the\nchiral anomaly characterising massless Dirac electrons.

The difficulty comes from the fact that the components of image---the\nsurface albedo, the direct illumination, and the ambient illumination---are\ncoupled heavily in observed image. We propose to infer the shading by ordering\npixels by their relative brightness, without knowing the absolute values of the\nimage components beforehand. The pairwise shading orders are estimated in two\nways: brightness order and low-order fittings of local shading field. The\nbrightness order is a non-local measure, which can be applied to any pair of\npixels including those whose reflectance and shading are both different. The\nlow-order fittings are used for pixel pairs within local regions of smooth\nshading. Together, they can capture both global order structure and local\nvariations of the shading. We propose a Consistency-aware Selective Fusion\n(CSF) to integrate the pairwise orders into a globally consistent order. The\niterative selection process solves the conflicts between the pairwise orders\nobtained by different estimation methods. Inconsistent or unreliable pairwise\norders will be automatically excluded from the fusion to avoid polluting the\nglobal order. Experiments on the MIT Intrinsic Image dataset show that the\nproposed model is effective at recovering the shading including deep shadows.\nOur model also works well on natural images from the IIW dataset, the UIUC\nShadow dataset and the NYU-Depth dataset, where the colors of direct lights and\nambient lights are quite different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Yet, recovering\nspatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (SVBRDFs)\nfrom a single image based on such cues has challenged researchers in computer\ngraphics for decades. We tackle lightweight appearance capture by training a\ndeep neural network to automatically extract and make sense of these visual\ncues. Once trained, our network is capable of recovering per-pixel normal,\ndiffuse albedo, specular albedo and specular roughness from a single picture of\na flat surface lit by a hand-held flash. We achieve this goal by introducing\nseveral innovations on training data acquisition and network design. For\ntraining, we leverage a large dataset of artist-created, procedural SVBRDFs\nwhich we sample and render under multiple lighting directions. We further\namplify the data by material mixing to cover a wide diversity of shading\neffects, which allows our network to work across many material classes.\nMotivated by the observation that distant regions of a material sample often\noffer complementary visual cues, we design a network that combines an\nencoder-decoder convolutional track for local feature extraction with a\nfully-connected track for global feature extraction and propagation. Many\nimportant material effects are view-dependent, and as such ambiguous when\nobserved in a single image. We tackle this challenge by defining the loss as a\ndifferentiable SVBRDF similarity metric that compares the renderings of the\npredicted maps against renderings of the ground truth from several lighting and\nviewing directions. Combined together, these novel ingredients bring clear\nimprovement over state of the art methods for single-shot capture of spatially\nvarying BRDFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 08:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

We discuss and evaluate various\nPAC-Bayesian approaches to derive such bounds. The bounds do not require\nadditional hold-out data, because the out-of-bag samples from the bagging in\nthe training process can be exploited. A random forest predicts by taking a\nmajority vote of an ensemble of decision trees. The first approach is to bound\nthe error of the vote by twice the error of the corresponding Gibbs classifier\n(classifying with a single member of the ensemble selected at random). However,\nthis approach does not take into account the effect of averaging out of errors\nof individual classifiers when taking the majority vote. This effect provides a\nsignificant boost in performance when the errors are independent or negatively\ncorrelated, but when the correlations are strong the advantage from taking the\nmajority vote is small. The second approach based on PAC-Bayesian C-bounds\ntakes dependencies between ensemble members into account, but it requires\nestimating correlations between the errors of the individual classifiers. When\nthe correlations are high or the estimation is poor, the bounds degrade. In our\nexperiments, we compute generalization bounds for random forests on various\nbenchmark data sets. Because the individual decision trees already perform\nwell, their predictions are highly correlated and the C-bounds do not lead to\nsatisfactory results. For the same reason, the bounds based on the analysis of\nGibbs classifiers are typically superior and often reasonably tight. Bounds\nbased on a validation set coming at the cost of a smaller training set gave\nbetter performance guarantees, but worse performance in most experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 09:44:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 10:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

However, a cost is usually\nassociated with the filter narrowing either in the dynamic range, in the\nthroughput or the manufacturability. Here we report on a resonating planar\nmultilayered structure that exhibits transparency window in reflection with a\ncontrollable full width at half maximum (sub-Angstroms till tens of nm) and\ntunability over wide spectral range (>500nm in the visible and near infrared).\nThe phenomenon is observed in TE and TM polarizations with much higher contrast\nin TE. Fano type resonance originating from coupling between waveguide modes\nand lossy surface electromagnetic waves supported by field distribution\ncalculations explains the phenomenon. The wide tuning range with high contrast\nis mainly achieved using an absorptive layer with high imaginary to real part\nratio of the dielectric constant that enables excitation of lossy surface waves\nknown to exist over a wide spectral band in thin films. To avoid large losses,\nit is found that the lossy layer should be ultrathin (6nm Cr layer for\nexample). The tuning is achieved by small angular scan of less than 2 degrees\nor by modulating the refractive index or thickness of the submicron thick\nwaveguide layer from the visible till the near infrared range and in principle\nit can be designed to operate in any spectral range. Such a thin variable index\nor thickness layer can allow tuning at ultrahigh speed using conventional\nelectrooptic, magnetooptic, piezoelectric or thermooptic materials at\nrelatively low external fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 10:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

SPARQL-LD is a recent extension of\nSPARQL 1.1 which enables to directly query any HTTP web source containing RDF\ndata, like web pages embedded with RDFa, JSON-LD or Microformats, without\nrequiring the declaration of named graphs. This makes possible to query a large\nnumber of data sources (including SPARQL endpoints, online resources, or even\nWeb APIs returning RDF data) through a single one concise query. However, not\noptimal formulation of SPARQL 1.1 and SPARQL-LD queries can lead to a large\nnumber of calls to remote resources which in turn can lead to extremely high\nquery execution times.

Such a query\noptimization approach is widely applicable since it can be exploited on top of\nexisting SPARQL 1.1 and SPARQL-LD implementations.

These cases\ncan be traced to a problem of the reduction pipeline in propagating the\nwavelength calibration between neighboring fibres near the edges of the field\nplate, in particular for observations done just before fibre repairs, i.e. when\nlive fibres were separated by large gaps of broken ones. In 82\\%\\ of these\ncases the offset between RAVE DR5 and Gaia DR2 radial velocity is in the $+105\n\\pm 15$~\\kms range. These spectra belong to the first 10 fibres of the field\nplate. Another 3\\%\\ of the spectra have velocity offset in the $-76 \\pm 4$~\\kms\nrange and were observed with the fibres 148-150. Even though the majority of\nthese 707 stars do not exhibit any particularity in the radial velocity, we\nrecommend excluding them from future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Intuitively, recognizing one venue category\ninvolves multiple semantic cues, especially objects and scenes, and thus they\nshould contribute together to venue category prediction. In addition, these\nvenues can be organized in a natural hierarchical structure, which provides\nprior knowledge to guide venue category estimation. Taking these aspects into\naccount, we propose a Hierarchy-dependent Cross-platform Multi-view Feature\nLearning (HCM-FL) framework for venue category prediction from videos by\nleveraging images from other platforms. HCM-FL includes two major components,\nnamely Cross-Platform Transfer Deep Learning (CPTDL) and Multi-View Feature\nLearning with the Hierarchical Venue Structure (MVFL-HVS). CPTDL is capable of\nreinforcing the learned deep network from videos using images from other\nplatforms. Specifically, CPTDL first trained a deep network using videos. These\nimages from other platforms are filtered by the learnt network and these\nselected images are then fed into this learnt network to enhance it. Two kinds\nof pre-trained networks on the ImageNet and Places dataset are employed.\nMVFL-HVS is then developed to enable multi-view feature fusion. It is capable\nof embedding the hierarchical structure ontology to support more discriminative\njoint feature learning. We conduct the experiment on videos from Vine and\nimages from Foursqure. These experimental results demonstrate the advantage of\nour proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

The phenomenon of sea ripple\nformation is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation in which the\nsediment bed is represented by a large number of fully-resolved spherical\ngrains. Two sets of parameter values are adopted which are motivated by\nlaboratory experiments on the formation of laminar rolling-grain ripples. The\nknowledge on the origin of ripples is presently enriched by insights and by\nproviding fluid- and sediment-related quantities that are difficult to obtain\nin the laboratory. Detailed analysis of flow and sediment bed evolution has\nconfirmed that ripple wavelength is determined by the action of steady\nrecirculating cells which tend to accumulate sediment grains into ripple\ncrests. The ripple amplitude is observed to grow exponentially consistent with\nestablished linear stability analysis theories. Particles at the bed surface\nexhibit two kinds of motion depending on their position with respect to the\nrecirculating cells: particles at ripple crests are significantly faster and\nshow larger excursions than those lying on ripple troughs. In analogy with\nsegregation phenomenon of polydisperse sediments the non-uniform distribution\nof the velocity field promotes the formation of ripples. The wider the gap\nbetween the excursion of fast and slow particles, the the larger the resulting\ngrowth rate of ripples. Finally, it is revealed that, in the absence of\nturbulence, the sediment flow rate is driven by both the bed shear stress and\nthe wave-induced pressure gradient, the dominance of each depending on the\nphase of the oscillation period. In phases of maximum bed shear stress, the\nsediment flow rate correlates more with the Shields number while the pressure\ngradient tends to drive sediment bed motion during phases of minimum bed shear\nstress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Although various situations have been theoretically\nenvisaged, particularly lattice models in which band flattening resembles\nLandau levels, the predicted fractions have never been observed. In this\nLetter, we show that odd and even denominator fractions can be observed, and\nmanipulated, in the absence of a quantizing magnetic field, when a low-density\nelectron system in a GaAs based one-dimensional quantum wire is allowed to\nrelax in the second dimension. It is suggested that such a relaxation results\nin formation of a zig-zag array of electrons with ring paths which establish a\ncyclic current and a resultant lowering of energy. The behavior has been\nobserved for both symmetric and asymmetric confinement but increasing the\nasymmetry of the confinement potential, to result in a flattening of\nconfinement, enhances the appearance of new fractional states. We find that an\nin-plane magnetic field induces new even denominator fractions possibly\nindicative of electron pairing. The new quantum states described here have\nimplications both for the physics of low dimensional electron systems and also\nfor quantum technologies. This work will enable further development of\nstructures which are designed to electrostatically manipulate the electrons for\nthe formation of particular configurations. In turn, this could result in a\ndesigner tailoring of fractional states to amplify particular properties of\nimportance in future quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 13:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

One can rank a large class of hyperuniform systems by\ntheir ability to suppress long-range density fluctuations through the use of a\nhyperuniformity order metric $\\bar{\\Lambda}$. We apply this order metric to the\nBarlow packings, which are the infinitely degenerate densest packings of\nidentical rigid spheres that are distinguished by their stacking geometries and\ninclude the commonly known fcc lattice and hcp crystal. The \"stealthy stacking\"\ntheorem implies that these packings are all stealthy hyperuniform, a strong\ntype of hyperuniformity which involves the suppression of scattering up to a\nwavevector $K$. We describe the geometry of three classes of Barlow packings,\ntwo disordered classes and small-period packings. In addition, we compute a\nlower bound on $K$ for all Barlow packings. We compute $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ for the\naforementioned three classes of Barlow packings and find that to a very good\napproximation, it is linear in the fraction of fcc-like clusters, taking values\nbetween those of least-ordered hcp and most-ordered fcc. This implies that the\n$\\bar{\\Lambda}$ of all Barlow packings is primarily controlled by the local\ncluster geometry. These results indicate the special nature of anisotropic\nstacking disorder, which provides impetus for future research on the\ndevelopment of anisotropic order metrics and hyperuniformity properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 14:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 01:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

To\ndemonstrate the potential of our new transfer approach, we apply it to\nfabricate graphene electrical probes. Graphene, due to its flexibility,\ntransparency and conductivity, is an ideal material with which to replace\nconventional metal based probes. In particular, with a contact resistance in\nthe order of tens of kOhm, these graphene probes may find applications, such as\nin electrophysiology studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

However, much of the\nunderlying physics of these platforms are poorly characterized. To further the\nunderstanding of these structures, a study of lipid membrane tension on DIB\nmembranes is measured by analysing the equilibrium shape of asymmetric DIBs. To\nthis end, the morphology of DIBs is explored for the first time using confocal\nlaser scanning fluorescence microscopy (CLSM). The experimental results confirm\nthat, in accordance with theory, the bilayer interface of a volume asymmetric\nDIB is curved toward the smaller droplet and a lipid asymmetric DIB is curved\ntoward the droplet with the higher monolayer surface tension. Moreover, the DIB\nshape can be exploited to measure complex bilayer surface energies. In this\nstudy, the bilayer surface energy of DIBs composed of lipid mixtures of\nphosphatidylgylcerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) are shown to increase\nlinearly with PG concentrations up to 25%. The assumption that DIB bilayer area\ncan be geometrically approximated as a spherical cap base is also tested, and\nit is discovered that the bilayer curvature is negligible for most practical\nsymmetric or asymmetric DIB systems with respect to bilayer area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model. For\nexample, despite that widely applied evolution equations predict effective spin\nto be constant in absence of dissipation, the CFS-unstable star should be\nobserved as spinning-down.

However, it has been observed that,\nunder low programming current condition, data stability becomes challenging.\nTherefore, this programming state stability needed further investigation. This\nthesis addresses the problem of state stability, first, by presenting the\nequipment and algorithms used to study OxRAM state loss over short time\nintervals. Secondly, various experiments and tests are performed searching for\na key parameter in order to control memory retention. Finally, this work\ndemonstrates that resistance evolution over time is affected by both a\ndeterminist drift (logarithmically dependent on time) and a random stochastic\nfluctuation component. It also demonstrates that this behavior is intrinsic in\nthe nature of the device itself and does not depend on processing issues or\nvariation in the programming conditions. This experimental study proved the\nintrinsic nature of the program instability phenomena in OxRAM devices, which\nin turns leads to the ineffectiveness of verify algorithm for low current\noperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 16:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Also, user with partial\nphysical disability can interact with electronic devices using such systems.\nResearch in this direction has got major boost because of the emergence of\nlow-cost sensors such as Leap Motion, Kinect or RealSense devices. In this\npaper, we propose a Leap Motion controller-based methodology to facilitate\nrendering of 2D and 3D shapes on display devices. The proposed method tracks\nfinger movements while users perform natural gestures within the field of view\nof the sensor. In the next phase, trajectories are analyzed to extract extended\nNpen++ features in 3D. These features represent finger movements during the\ngestures and they are fed to unidirectional left-to-right Hidden Markov Model\n(HMM) for training. A one-to-one mapping between gestures and shapes is\nproposed. Finally, shapes corresponding to these gestures are rendered over the\ndisplay using MuPad interface. We have created a dataset of 5400 samples\nrecorded by 10 volunteers. Our dataset contains 18 geometric and 18\nnon-geometric shapes such as \"circle\", \"rectangle\", \"flower\", \"cone\", \"sphere\"\netc. The proposed methodology achieves an accuracy of 92.87% when evaluated\nusing 5-fold cross validation method.

In such a large distributed\ninformation system, resource discovery becomes a critical problem.\n  Recent developments in resource discovery systems, such as Harvest and\nWhois++, provide scalable mechanisms for the identification, location and\ncharacterization of networked information resources based upon resource\nmeta-information. However, the Web's vast information space can only be handled\neffectively, when resources are meaningfully classified into coherent\nconceptual structures.\n  The automatic classification of resource meta-information is at the heart of\nthe WAVE system, which employs methods from the mathematical theory of concept\nanalysis to analyze and interactively explore the vast information space\ndefined by wide area resource discovery services. In this paper we discuss\nthese methods by interpreting various synoptic and summary interchange formats\nfor resource meta-information, such as the Harvest SOIF and the Whois++ urc, in\nterms of basic ideas from concept analysis. In so doing, we advocate concept\nanalysis as a principled approach to effective resource discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 21:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

The\nplayer is constrained by the maximum budget $B$ that can be spent to perform\nactions, and the rewards and the costs of the actions are assigned by an\nadversary. This problem has only been studied in the restricted setting where\nthe reward of an action is greater than the cost of the action, while we\nprovide a solution in the general setting. Namely, we propose EXP3.BwK, a novel\nalgorithm that achieves order optimal regret. We also propose EXP3++.BwK, which\nis order optimal in the adversarial BwK setup, and incurs an almost optimal\nexpected regret with an additional factor of $\\log(B)$ in the stochastic BwK\nsetup. Finally, we investigate the case of having large costs for the actions\n(i.e., they are comparable to the budget size $B$), and show that for the\nadversarial setting, achievable regret bounds can be significantly worse,\ncompared to the case of having costs bounded by a constant, which is a common\nassumption within the BwK literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 04:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

The mathematical\nmodels for superconductors have evolved from simple analytical models to\ncomplex numerical models. The available analytical models are just capable of\nestimating electromagnetic quantities in single wires or small arrays. The\nnumerical models like the H formulation finite element models are useful for\nthe analysis of more medium-size systems, but their application in large-scale\nsystems is problematic due to the excessive cost in terms of memory and the\ncomputation time. Then it is necessary to devise new strategies to tackle this\nchallenge. The homogenization and the multi-scale approach are methodologies\nthat have successfully simplified the description of the systems allowing the\nstudy of large-scale systems. Recently, efficient calculations have been\nachieved using the T-A formulation. In this manuscript, we analyze the adequate\norder of the elements used in the T-A formulation. More importantly, we propose\na series of adaptations to the homogenization and multi-scale methodologies in\norder to allow their implementation to the T-A formulation models. The proposed\nstrategies are validated by means of comparing them with the H reference model\nof a racetrack coil. The computation time and memory demand are substantially\nreduced up to a point that makes it possible to perform real-time simulations\nfor slow ramping cycles. At the same time the comparison demonstrates a very\ngood agreement with respect to the reference model, both at a local and global\nlevel, is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 17:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Most of the research works,\nhowever, do not differentiate among different types of attacks. This is, in\nfact, necessary for appropriate countermeasures and defense against attacks. In\nthis paper, we investigate both detecting and categorizing anomalies rather\nthan just detecting, which is a common trend in the contemporary research\nworks. We have used a popular publicly available dataset to build and test\nlearning models for both detection and categorization of different attacks. To\nbe precise, we have used two supervised machine learning techniques, namely\nlinear regression (LR) and random forest (RF). We show that even if detection\nis perfect, categorization can be less accurate due to similarities between\nattacks. Our results demonstrate more than 99% detection accuracy and\ncategorization accuracy of 93.6%, with the inability to categorize some\nattacks. Further, we argue that such categorization can be applied to\nmulti-cloud environments using the same machine learning techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 14:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}
