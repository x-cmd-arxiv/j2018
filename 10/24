Of particular interest is the modularity of the human brain, where\nthe connectome is divided into subnetworks and subsequently changes with\ndevelopment, aging or disease are investigated. We present a weighted network\nmeasure, the Network Dependency Index (NDI), to identify an individual region's\nimportance to the global functioning of the network. Importantly, we utilize\nNDI to differentiate four subnetworks (Tiers) in the human connectome following\nGaussian Mixture Model fitting. We analyze the topological aspects of each\nsubnetwork with respect to age and compare it to rich-club based subnetworks\n(rich-club, feeder and seeder). Our results first demonstrate the efficacy of\nNDI to identify more consistent, central nodes of the connectome across\nage-groups, when compared to the rich-club framework. Stratifying the\nconnectome by NDI led to consistent subnetworks across the life-span revealing\ndistinct patterns associated with age where, e.g., the key relay nuclei and\ncortical regions are contained in a subnetwork with highest NDI. The divisions\nof the human connectome derived from our data-driven NDI framework have the\npotential to reveal topological alterations described by network measures\nthrough the life-span.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 16:01:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 17:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 01:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 20:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

To approach these challenges, we introduce the\nDeepLight framework, which utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based DL\nmodels to analyze whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)\ndata. To decode a cognitive state (e.g., seeing the image of a house),\nDeepLight separates the fMRI volume into a sequence of axial brain slices,\nwhich is then sequentially processed by an LSTM.

Yet replay-based methods are often the most sample\nefficient, and incorporating $\\lambda$-returns into them is a viable way to\nachieve new state-of-the-art performance. Towards this, we propose the first\nmethod to enable practical use of $\\lambda$-returns in arbitrary replay-based\nmethods without relying on other forms of decorrelation such as asynchronous\ngradient updates. By promoting short sequences of past transitions into a small\ncache within the replay memory, adjacent $\\lambda$-returns can be efficiently\nprecomputed by sharing Q-values.

Additionally,\nour method grants the unique ability to observe TD errors prior to sampling;\nfor the first time, transitions can be prioritized by their true significance\nrather than by a proxy to it. Furthermore, we propose the novel use of the TD\nerror to dynamically select $\\lambda$-values that facilitate faster learning.\nWe show that these innovations can enhance the performance of DQN when playing\nAtari 2600 games, even under partial observability.

Determining the photodissociation rate of H2 by an\nincident Lyman-Werner (LW) flux is thus crucial, but prohibitively expensive to\ncalculate on the fly in simulations. The rate is sensitive to the H2\nrovibrational distribution, which in turn depends on the gas density,\ntemperature, and incident LW radiation field.

In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH.

Moreover, the cancellation generically\nrequires the inclusion of the forward scattering process. We provide a number\nof examples showing the importance of this revised understanding: in $e^+e^-\n\\to Z$ at next-to-leading order, one can sum over certain initial and final\nstates with an arbitrary number of extra photons, or only over final states\nwith a finite number of photons, if forward scattering is included.

The balance of Reynolds to viscous stresses\nwithin the canopy is observed to be similar to that over a smooth wall. From\nthis, a scaling based on their local sum is proposed. Using the conventional\nscaling based on the total stress, the velocity fluctuations are typically\nreported to be reduced within the canopy compared to smooth walls. When the\nproposed height-dependent scaling is used, however, the fluctuations are closer\nto those over smooth walls. This suggests that, in a large part, the effect of\nthe canopy can be reduced to the modification of the local scaling, rather than\nto the direct interaction of the canopy elements with the turbulence. Based on\nthis, a model is proposed that consists of a drag that acts on the mean flow\nalone, aiming to produce the correct scaling without modifying the fluctuations\ndirectly.

For those defenses\nthat have tried to make models more robust, with our technique, an adversary\ncan craft adversarial examples with no knowledge of the defense. For defenses\nthat attempt to detect the adversarial examples, with our technique, an\nadversary only needs very limited information about the defense to craft\nadversarial examples. We demonstrate our technique by applying it against two\ndefenses which make models more robust and two defenses which detect\nadversarial examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Such a behavior is commonplace in social networks. The\nsignificant overlaps among communities make most existing community detection\nalgorithms ineffective. The lack of effective and efficient tools resulted in\nvery few empirical studies on large-scale detection and analyses of overlapping\ncommunity structure in real social networks. We developed recently a scalable\nand accurate method called the Partial Community Merger Algorithm (PCMA) with\nlinear complexity and demonstrated its effectiveness by analyzing two online\nsocial networks, Sina Weibo and Friendster, with 79.4 and 65.6 million\nvertices, respectively. Here, we report in-depth analyses of the 2.9 million\ncommunities detected by PCMA to uncover their complex overlapping structure.\nEach community usually overlaps with a significant number of other communities\nand has far more outbound edges than internal edges. Yet, the communities\nremain well separated from each other. Most vertices in a community are\nmulti-membership vertices, and they can be at the core or the peripheral.\nAlmost half of the entire network can be accounted for by an extremely dense\nnetwork of communities, with the communities being the vertices and the\noverlaps being the edges. The empirical findings ask for rethinking the notion\nof community, especially the boundary of a community. Realizing that it is how\nthe edges are organized that matters, the f-core is suggested as a suitable\nconcept for overlapping community in social networks. The results shed new\nlight on the understanding of overlapping community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 09:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

We extend their result by showing that if a finite\ngroup $G$ admits a $1$-rotational $k=2^nm$-factorization where $n\\geq 1$, and\n$m$ is odd, then $G$ has at most $m(2^n-1)$ conjugacy classes containing\ninvolutions. Also, we show that if $G$ has exactly $m(2^n-1)$ conjugacy classes\ncontaining involutions, then the product of a central involution with an\ninvolution in one conjugacy class yields an involution in a different conjugacy\nclass. We then demonstrate a method of constructing a $1$-rotational\n$2n$-factorization under $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_n$ given a $1$-rotational\n$2$-factorization under a finite group $G$. This construction, given a\n$1$-rotational solution to the Oberwolfach problem $OP(a_{\\infty},a_1, a_2\n\\cdots, a_n)$, allows us to find a solution to $OP(2a_{\\infty}-1,^2a_1,\n^2a_2\\cdots, ^2a_n)$ when the $a_i$'s are even ($i \\neq \\infty$), and\n$OP(p(a_{\\infty}-1)+1, ^pa_1, ^pa_2 \\cdots, ^pa_n)$ when $p$ is an odd prime,\nwith no restrictions on the $a_i$'s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Dropping this assumption,\nfluctuations of net flow at source and/or sink nodes may render the pure tree\nsolutions unstable even under a simple local adaptation rule for conductances.\nHere, we consider tree-like networks under the influence of spatially\nheterogeneous distribution of fluctuations, where the root of the tree is\nsupplied by a constant source and the leaves at the bottom are equipped with\nsinks with fluctuating loads. We find that the network divides into two regions\ncharacterized by tree-like motifs and stable cycles. The cycles emerge through\ntranscritical bifurcations at a critical amplitude of fluctuation. For a simple\nnetwork structure, depending on parameters defining the local adaptation,\ncycles first appear close to the leaves (or root) and then appear closer\ntowards the root (or the leaves). The interaction between topology and dynamics\ngives rise to complex feedback mechanisms with many open questions in the\ntheory of network dynamics.

Then, we show that the calmness\ncondition of the induced set-valued map, together with a local version of the\nproper separation of stationary value condition, is a sufficient condition to\nensure the linear convergence of the algorithm. The equivalence of the calmness\ncondition to the one for the canonically perturbed stationary point set-valued\nmap is proved, and this equivalence allows us to derive some sufficient\nconditions for calmness by using some recent developments in variational\nanalysis. These sufficient conditions are different from existing results\n(especially, those error-bound-based ones) in that they can be easily verified\nfor many concrete application models.

Besides the potential for self-healing,\nrecent experimental work suggests that freely diffusing reversible crosslinks\nin polymer networks, such as gels, can enhance the toughness of the material\nwithout substantial change in elasticity. This presents the opportunity for\nmaking highly elastic materials that can be strained to a large extent before\nrupturing. Here, we employ Gaussian chain theory, molecular simulation, and\npolymer self-consistent field theory for networks to construct an equilibrium\npicture for how reversible crosslinks can toughen a polymer network without\naffecting its linear elasticity. Maximisation of polymer entropy drives the\nreversible crosslinks to bind preferentially near the permanent crosslinks in\nthe network, leading to local molecular reinforcement without significant\nalteration of the network topology. In equilibrium conditions, permanent\ncrosslinks share effectively the load with neighbouring reversible crosslinks,\nforming multi-functional crosslink points. The network is thereby globally\ntoughened, while the linear elasticity is left largely unaltered. Practical\nguidelines are proposed to optimise this design in experiment, along with a\ndiscussion of key kinetic and timescale considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) methods attempt to address\nthis scalability issue by learning action selection policies at multiple levels\nof temporal abstraction. Abstraction can be had by identifying a relatively\nsmall set of states that are likely to be useful as subgoals, in concert with\nthe learning of corresponding skill policies to achieve those subgoals. Many\napproaches to subgoal discovery in HRL depend on the analysis of a model of the\nenvironment, but the need to learn such a model introduces its own problems of\nscale. Once subgoals are identified, skills may be learned through intrinsic\nmotivation, introducing an internal reward signal marking subgoal attainment.\nIn this paper, we present a novel model-free method for subgoal discovery using\nincremental unsupervised learning over a small memory of the most recent\nexperiences (trajectories) of the agent. When combined with an intrinsic\nmotivation learning mechanism, this method learns both subgoals and skills,\nbased on experiences in the environment.

The aim of this study is twofold: (1) estimate\ntravel times in the freeway network at five-minute intervals using Basic Safety\nMessages (BSM); (2) develop an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model for\nshort-term travel time prediction on freeways. The XGB tree-based ensemble\nprediction model is evaluated against common tree-based ensemble algorithms and\nthe evaluations are performed at five-minute intervals over a 30-minute\nhorizon. BSMs generated by the Safety Pilot Model Deployment conducted in Ann\nArbor, Michigan, were used. Nearly two billion messages were processed for\nproviding travel time estimates for the entire freeway network. A Combination\nof grid search and five-fold cross-validation techniques using the travel time\nestimates were used for developing the prediction models and tuning their\nparameters. About 9.6 km freeway stretch was used for evaluating the XGB\ntogether with the most common tree-based ensemble algorithms.

Numerical methods that do\nnot consider this degeneracy or avoid it solely by regularising specific\nmaterial properties generally become computationally expensive as soon as the\nmelt fraction approaches zero in some part of the domain.\n  Here, we present a new formulation of the equations for coupled magma/mantle\ndynamics that addresses this problem, and allows it to accurately compute\nlarge-scale 3-D magma/mantle dynamics simulations with extensive regions of\nzero melt fraction. We achieve this by rescaling one of the solution variables,\nthe compaction pressure, which ensures that for vanishing melt fraction, the\nequation causing the degeneracy becomes an identity and the other two equations\nrevert to the Stokes system. This allows us to split the domain into two parts,\nand to solve the coupled magma/mantle dynamics system only in cells where melt\nis present.\n  We have implemented this formulation in the open source geodynamic modelling\ncode ASPECT and illustrate the improved performance compared to the previous\nthree-field formulation, showing numerically that the new formulation is\noptimal in terms of problem size and only minimally sensitive to model\nparameters. Beyond that, we demonstrate the applicability to realistic problems\nby showing large-scale 2-D and 3-D models of mid-ocean ridges with complex\nrheology.

To\nhandle such situations, legal literature has proposed the concept of an\nallegation escrow: a neutral third-party that collects allegations anonymously,\nmatches them against each other, and de-anonymizes allegers only after\nde-anonymity thresholds (in terms of number of co-allegers), pre-specified by\nthe allegers, are reached.\n  An allegation escrow can be realized as a single trusted third party;\nhowever, this party must be trusted to keep the identity of the alleger and\ncontent of the allegation private.

The traditional (preventive) approach to avoid voltage\ncollapse is based on ensuring that the network never reaches its maximum\ncapacity. However, such an approach leads to inefficiencies as it prevents\noperators to fully utilize the network resources and does not account for\nunprescribed events. To overcome this limitation, this paper seeks to initiate\nthe study of voltage collapse stabilization.\n  More precisely, for a DC network, we formulate the problem of voltage\nstability as a dynamic problem where each load seeks to achieve a constant\npower consumption by updating its conductance as the voltage changes. We show\nthat such a system can be interpreted as a dynamic game, where each player\n(load) seeks to myopically maximize their utility, and where every stable power\nflow solution amounts to a Local Nash Equilibrium.\n  Using this framework, we show that voltage collapse is equivalent to the\nnon-existence of a Local Nash Equilibrium in the game and, as a result, it is\ncaused by the lack of cooperation between loads. Finally, we propose a Voltage\nCollapse Stabilizer (VCS) controller that uses (flexible) loads that are\nwilling to cooperate and provides a fair allocation of the curtailed demand.\nOur solution stabilizes voltage collapse even in the presence of\nnon-cooperative loads.

As such, the secondary user can send its sensing data, i.e.,\ntransactions, to the mining pools. After being verified by miners, the\ntransactions are added to the blocks. However, under the dynamics of the\nprimary channel and the uncertainty of the mempool state of the mining pool, it\nis challenging for the secondary user to determine an optimal transaction\ntransmission policy. In this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithm to derive an optimal transaction transmission policy for the\nsecondary user. Specifically, we adopt a Double Deep-Q Network (DDQN) that\nallows the secondary user to learn the optimal policy.

While high-redshift radio galaxies usually pinpoint the location\nof these environments, we have recently discovered at z~2-3 three Enormous\n(>200 kpc) Lyman-Alpha Nebulae (ELANe) that host multiple AGN and that are\nsurrounded by overdensities of Lyman-alpha Emitters (LAE). These regions are\nprime candidates of massive protoclusters in the early stages of assembly. To\ncharacterize the star-forming activity within these rare structures - both on\nELAN and protocluster scales - we have initiated an observational campaign with\nthe JCMT and the APEX telescopes. In this paper we report on sensitive\nSCUBA-2/JCMT 850 and 450 $\\mu$m observations of a 128 arcmin$^2$ field\ncomprising the ELAN MAMMOTH-1, together with the peak of the hosting BOSS1441\nLAE overdensity at z=2.32.

At low\nvalues of porosity, the surface forces on the solid obstacles compete with the\ninertial force of the fluid flow to result in the formation of flow\ninstabilities. In this paper, we report the origin and mechanism of a\nsymmetry-breaking phenomenon in periodic porous media that causes a deviation\nin the direction of the mean flow from that of the applied pressure gradient.\nLarge Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to simulate turbulent flow in a homogeneous\nporous medium consisting of a periodic, square lattice arrangement of\ncylindrical solid obstacles. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is used to\nsimulate the transient stages during symmetry breakdown and also to validate\nthe LES method. Quantitative and qualitative observations are made from the\nfollowing approaches: (1) macroscale momentum budget, (2) 2D & 3D flow\nvisualization. The phenomenon draws its roots from the amplification of a flow\ninstability that emerges from the vortex shedding process. The\nsymmetry-breaking phenomenon is a pitchfork bifurcation that can exhibit\nmultiple modes depending on the local vortex shedding process. The phenomenon\nis observed to be sensitive to the porosity, solid obstacle shape, and the\nReynolds number. It is a source of macroscale turbulence anisotropy in porous\nmedia for symmetric solid obstacle geometries. The resulting macroscale flow\nfield is oriented such that it does not align with the plane of symmetry of the\nporous matrix geometry. The principal axis of the Reynolds stress tensor is not\naligned with any of the geometric axes of symmetry, nor with the direction of\nflow. Thus, symmetry-breaking in porous media involves new flow physics that\nshould be taken into consideration while modeling flow inhomogeneity in the\nmacroscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 00:48:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 20:29:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 17:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

A better\nunderstanding of neural synchronisation mechanisms can thus help control or\neven treat epilepsy. In this paper, we study neural synchronisation in a random\nnetwork where nodes are neurons with excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and\nneural activity for each node is provided by the adaptive exponential\nintegrate-and-fire model. In this framework, we verify that the decrease in the\ninfluence of inhibition can generate synchronisation originating from a pattern\nof desynchronised spikes. The transition from desynchronous spikes to\nsynchronous bursts of activity, induced by varying the synaptic coupling,\nemerges in a hysteresis loop due to bistability where abnormal (excessively\nhigh synchronous) regimes exist. We verify that, for parameters in the\nbistability regime, a square current pulse can trigger excessively high\n(abnormal) synchronisation, a process that can reproduce features of epileptic\nseizures. Then, we show that it is possible to suppress such abnormal\nsynchronisation by applying a small-amplitude external current on less than 10%\nof the neurons in the network. Our results demonstrate that external electrical\nstimulation not only can trigger synchronous behaviour, but more importantly,\nit can be used as a means to reduce abnormal synchronisation and thus, control\nor treat effectively epileptic seizures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 00:49:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 14:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 15:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 17:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Such information analyzing process is called\nabstracting, which recognize similarities or differences across all the\ngarments and collections. In fact, such abstraction ability is useful in many\nfashion careers with different purposes. Fashion forecasters abstract across\ndesign collections and across time to identify fashion change and directions;\ndesigners, product developers and buyers abstract across a group of garments\nand collections to develop a cohesive and visually appeal lines; sales and\nmarketing executives abstract across product line each season to recognize\nselling points; fashion journalist and bloggers abstract across runway photos\nto recognize symbolic core concepts that can be translated into editorial\nfeatures. Fashion attributes analysis for such fashion insiders requires much\ndetailed and in-depth attributes annotation than that for consumers, and\nrequires inference on multiple domains. In this project, we propose a\ndata-driven approach for recognizing fashion attributes. Specifically, a\nmodified version of Faster R-CNN model is trained on images from a large-scale\nlocalization dataset with 594 fine-grained attributes under different\nscenarios, for example in online stores and street snapshots. This model will\nthen be used to detect garment items and classify clothing attributes for\nrunway photos and fashion illustrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 01:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Automatic segmentation of breast masses in mammograms is essential\nbut challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the wide variety of\nmass shapes and sizes. Existing methods deal with these challenges mainly by\nextracting mass-centered image patches manually or automatically. However,\nmanual patch extraction is time-consuming and automatic patch extraction brings\nerrors that could not be compensated in the following segmentation step. In\nthis study, we propose a novel attention-guided dense-upsampling network\n(AUNet) for accurate breast mass segmentation in whole mammograms directly.

Since molecular gas is essential for star formation, it is vital to\nestablish whether, and by how much, galaxy interactions affect the molecular\ngas properties. We investigate the effect of interactions on global molecular\ngas properties by studying a sample of 58 galaxies in pairs and 154 control\ngalaxies. Molecular gas properties are determined from observations with the\nJCMT, PMO, CSO telescopes, and supplemented with data from the xCOLD GASS and\nJINGLE surveys at $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(2-1). The SFR, gas mass\n($M_\\mathrm{H_{2}}$), and gas fraction ($f_{gas}$) are all enhanced in galaxies\nin pairs by $\\sim$ 2.5 times compared to the controls matched in redshift,\nmass, and effective radius, while the enhancement of star formation efficiency\n(SFE $\\equiv$ SFR/$M_{H_{2}}$) is less than a factor of 2. We also find that\nthe enhancements in SFR, $M_{H_{2}}$ and $f_{gas}$ increase with decreasing\npair separation and are larger in systems with smaller stellar mass ratio.\nConversely, the SFE is only enhanced in close pairs (separation $<$ 20 kpc) and\nequal-mass systems; therefore most galaxies in pairs lie in the same parameter\nspace on the SFR-$M_{H_{2}}$ plane as controls. This is the first time that the\ndependence of molecular gas properties on merger configurations is probed\nstatistically with a relatively large sample and with a carefully-selected\ncontrol sample for individual galaxies.

However, it is ineffective to solely rely on\nconventional heuristics for movie planning, due to a large number of existing\nmovies and various real-world factors that contribute to the success of each\nmovie, such as the movie genre, available budget, production team (involving\nactor, actress, director, and writer), etc. In this paper, we study a\n\"Blockbuster Planning\" (BP) problem to learn from previous movies and plan for\nlow budget yet high return new movies in a totally data-driven fashion. After a\nthorough investigation of an online movie knowledge library, a novel movie\nplanning framework \"Blockbuster Planning with Maximized Movie Configuration\nAcquaintance\" (BigMovie) is introduced in this paper. From the investment\nperspective, BigMovie maximizes the estimated gross of the planned movies with\na given budget. It is able to accurately estimate the movie gross with a 0.26\nmean absolute percentage error (and 0.16 for budget). Meanwhile, from the\nproduction team's perspective, BigMovie is able to formulate an optimized team\nwith people/movie genres that team members are acquainted with. Historical\ncollaboration records are utilized to estimate acquaintance scores of movie\nconfiguration factors via an acquaintance tensor. We formulate the BP problem\nas a non-linear binary programming problem and prove its NP-hardness. To solve\nit in polynomial time, BigMovie relaxes the hard binary constraints and\naddresses the BP problem as a cubic programming problem. Extensive experiments\nconducted on IMDB movie database demonstrate the capability of BigMovie for an\neffective data-driven blockbuster planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 03:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

In addition, even small\nvariations in environmental conditions such as illumination and precipitation\ncan affect the classification performance of the segmentation model. Given the\nreliance on visual information, these effects often translate into poor\nsemantic pixel classification which can potentially lead to catastrophic\nconsequences when driving autonomously. This paper presents a novel method for\nanalysing the robustness of semantic segmentation models and provides a number\nof metrics to evaluate the classification performance over a variety of\nenvironmental conditions. The process incorporates an additional sensor (lidar)\nto automate the process, eliminating the need for labour-intensive hand\nlabelling of validation data. The system integrity can be monitored as the\nperformance of the vision sensors are validated against a different sensor\nmodality. This is necessary for detecting failures that are inherent to vision\ntechnology. Experimental results are presented based on multiple datasets\ncollected at different times of the year with different environmental\nconditions. These results show that the semantic segmentation performance\nvaries depending on the weather, camera parameters, existence of shadows, etc..\nThe results also demonstrate how the metrics can be used to compare and\nvalidate the performance after making improvements to a model, and compare the\nperformance of different networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 05:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Several cross-chain protocols have been\nproposed as ways of connecting these universes of individual blockchains in a\ndistributed and secure manner. In this paper, we present Niji, a new\ncross-chain protocol that allows parties to perform virtual Bitcoin payment\nsecurely on a consortium chain, without any trusted third-party or mediators.\nOur work focuses on the issue that it is difficult for a consortium chain's\ntoken to hold a stable market value, and Niji makes it possible for smart\ncontract services to acquire means of payment in the consortium chain. With the\nBitcoin payment channel built on the consortium chain, the process from payment\nto service provision runs autonomously without any interaction between parties.\nNiji introduces the concept of a transaction template to validate Bitcoin\npayments efficiently on different blockchains, and it allows a service provider\nto delegate all of its tasks for verifying state updates to a smart contract on\nthe consortium chain. We also propose a novel bi-directional payment channel\nadapted for design of the Niji protocol, which can update payments\nnon-interactively between parties. We implemented a prototype of the Niji\nprotocol and conducted an experiment measuring the computational cost and\nlatency that demonstrates the protocol's feasibility on practical platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 05:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Experimental studies of the temperature-, frequency-, and\nion--electrode distance-dependence of the electric field noise responsible for\nmotional heating, as well as the noise before and after ion bombardment\ncleaning of trap electrodes, suggest that fluctuations of adsorbate dipoles are\na likely source of so-called `anomalous heating,' or motional heating of the\ntrapped ions at a rate much higher than the Johnson noise limit. Previous\ncomputational studies have investigated how the fluctuation of model adsorbate\ndipoles affects anomalous heating. However, the way in which specific\nadsorbates affect the electric field noise has not yet been examined, and an\nelectric dipole model employed in previous studies is only accurate for a small\nsubset of possible adsorbates. Here, we analyze the behavior of both in-plane\nand out-of-plane vibrational modes of fifteen adsorbate--electrode combinations\nwithin the independent fluctuating dipole model, utilizing accurate first\nprinciples computational methods to determine the surface-induced dipole\nmoments.

Moreover, due to\nquantum-geometry corrections, the small-a behaviour of these instantons seem to\nnaturally favor a closing-off of the geometry in a regular fashion as was\noriginally proposed for the no-boundary wavefunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 06:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

The utilisation distribution describes the relative probability of use of\na spatial unit by an animal. It is natural to think of it as the long-term\nconsequence of the animal's short-term movement decisions: it is the\naccumulation of small displacements which, over time, gives rise to global\npatterns of space use. However, most utilisation distribution models either\nignore the underlying movement, assuming the independenceof observed locations,\nor are based on simplistic Brownian motion movement rules. 2. We introduce a\nnew continuous-time model of animal movement, based on the Langevin diffusion.\nThis stochastic process has an explicit stationary distribution, conceptually\nanalogous to the idea of the utilisation distribution, and thus provides an\nintuitive framework to integrate movement and space use. We model the\nstationary (utilisation) distribution with a resource selection function to\nlink the movement to spatial covariates, and allow inference into habitat\nselection. 3. Standard approximation techniques can be used to derive the\npseudo-likelihood of the Langevin diffusion movement model, and to estimate\nhabitat preference and movement parameters from tracking data. We investigate\nthe performance of the method on simulated data, and discuss its sensitivity to\nthe time scale of the sampling. We present an example of its application to\ntracking data of Stellar sea lions (Eumetopiasjubatus). 4. Due to its\ncontinuous-time formulation, this method can be applied to irregular telemetry\ndata. It provides a rigorous framework to estimate long-term habitat selection\nfrom correlated movement data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 06:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

However, most existing person ReID methods pay little\nattention to this resolution discrepancy problem. One paradigm to deal with\nthis problem is to use some complicated methods for mapping all images into an\nartificial image space, which however will disrupt the natural image\ndistribution and requires heavy image preprocessing. In this paper, we analyze\nthe deficiencies of several widely-used objective functions handling image\nresolution discrepancies and propose a new framework called deep antithetical\nlearning that directly learns from the natural image space rather than creating\nan arbitrary one. We first quantify and categorize original training images\naccording to their resolutions.

At last, a novel Contrastive Center Loss(CCL) is\nproposed to learn from images with different resolutions without being\ninterfered by their resolution discrepancies.

Based on theoretical\ncalculations and symmetry considerations, we identify the relevant interband\ntransitions that are coupled to the Fe-As mode. In particular, we show that a\nsizable $xy$ orbital component at the Fermi level is fundamental for the Fano\neffect and possibly also for the superconducting pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 07:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-03"}

Gottesmann in his\ninvestigation of quantum error-correcting codes. The simplest Clifford group in\nmultiqubit quantum computation is generated by a restricted set of unitary\nClifford gates - the Hadamard, $\\pi/4$-phase and controlled-X gates. Because of\nthis restriction the Clifford model of quantum computation can be efficiently\nsimulated on a classical computer (the Gottesmann-Knill theorem). However, this\nfact does not diminish the importance of the Clifford model, since it may serve\nas a suitable starting point for a full-fledged quantum computation.\n  In the general case of a single or composite quantum system with\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space the finite Weyl-Heisenberg group of unitary\noperators defines the quantum kinematics and the states of the quantum\nregister. Then the corresponding Clifford group is defined as the group of\nunitary operators leaving the Weyl-Heisenberg group invariant. The aim of this\ncontribution is to show that our comprehensive results on symmetries of the\nPauli gradings of quantum operator algebras -- covering any single as well as\ncomposite finite quantum systems -- directly correspond to Clifford groups\ndefined as quotients with respect to $\\U(1)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 09:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

They usually offer different classes of Virtual Machines (VMs)\nwhich ensure different guarantees in terms of availability and volatility,\nprovisioning the same resource through multiple pricing models. For instance,\nin Amazon EC2 cloud, the user pays per hour for on-demand VMs while spot VMs\nare unused instances available for lower price. Despite the monetary\nadvantages, a spot VM can be terminated, stopped, or hibernated by EC2 at any\nmoment.\n  Using both hibernation-prone spot VMs (for cost sake) and on-demand VMs, we\npropose in this paper a static scheduling for HPC applications which are\ncomposed by independent tasks (bag-of-task) with deadline constraints. However,\nif a spot VM hibernates and it does not resume within a time which guarantees\nthe application's deadline, a temporal failure takes place. Our scheduling,\nthus, aims at minimizing monetary costs of bag-of-tasks applications in EC2\ncloud, respecting its deadline and avoiding temporal failures. To this end, our\nalgorithm statically creates two scheduling maps: (i) the first one contains,\nfor each task, its starting time and on which VM (i.e., an available spot or\non-demand VM with the current lowest price) the task should execute; (ii) the\nsecond one contains, for each task allocated on a VM spot in the first map, its\nstarting time and on which on-demand VM it should be executed to meet the\napplication deadline in order to avoid temporal failures. The latter will be\nused whenever the hibernation period of a spot VM exceeds a time limit.\n  Performance results from simulation with task execution traces, configuration\nof Amazon EC2 VM classes, and VMs market history confirms the effectiveness of\nour scheduling and that it tolerates temporal failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 10:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Recent high precision space-based photometric surveys reveal\nthe rotational modulation from spots on stars in young clusters, including K2\nmonitoring of the 125-Myr-old Pleiades cluster. However, lightcurves reveal\nonly the asymmetries in the visible spot distributions rather than the total\nsizes of spots on stellar surfaces, which causes a discrepancy between the spot\ncoverage measured by photometric and spectroscopic observations.

With a new realistic\nreservoir hydro model, we find that if CO$_2$ emission reduction goes beyond\n70\\%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary\nfor a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility\ncomponents can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV\nshare by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We\nshow that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional\ninter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than\nultra-high-voltage-AC-connected \"One-Net\" grid. Finally, constraining\ntransmission volume from the optimum by up to 25\\% does not push total costs\nmuch higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with\nabundant interconnectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 12:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 15:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 10:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

Here, by starting\nfrom fundamental concepts, we derive and validate a universal bi-exponential\nformula that is required to model and predict the fourth D of 4D printed\nmulti-material structures. 4D printing is a new manufacturing paradigm to\nelaborate stimuli-responsive materials in multi-material structures for\nadvanced manufacturing (and construction) of advanced products (and\nstructures). It conserves the general attributes of 3D printing (such as the\nelimination of molds, dies, and machining) and further enables the fourth\ndimension of products and structures to provide intelligent behavior over time.\nThis intelligent behavior is encoded (usually by an inverse mathematical\nproblem) into stimuli-responsive multi-materials during printing and is enabled\nby stimuli after printing. Here, we delve into the fourth dimension and reveal\nthree general laws that govern the time-dependent shape-shifting behaviors of\nalmost all (photochemical-, photothermal-, solvent-, pH-, moisture-,\nelectrochemical-, electrothermal-, ultrasound-, enzyme-, etc.-responsive)\nmulti-material 4D structures.

As the cell size reduces, however, it becomes\nextremely difficult to meet this requirement with ferromagnets because\nspin-transfer torque for ferromagnets is a surface torque due to rapid spin\ndephasing, leading to the 1/ferromagnet-thickness dependence of the spin-torque\nefficiency. Requirement of a larger switching current for a thicker and thus\nmore thermally stable ferromagnetic cell is the fundamental obstacle for\nhigh-density non-volatile applications with ferromagnets. Theories predicted\nthat antiferromagnets have a long spin coherence length due to the staggered\nspin order on an atomic scale, thereby resolving the above fundamental\nlimitation. Despite several spin-torque experiments on antiferromagnets and\nferrimagnetic alloys, this prediction has remained unexplored.

To model the\nuncertainty of environments, we formulate the long-term resource allocation\nproblem as a stochastic game for maximizing the expected rewards, where each\nUAV becomes a learning agent and each resource allocation solution corresponds\nto an action taken by the UAVs. Afterwards, we develop a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) framework that each agent discovers its best\nstrategy according to its local observations using learning. More specifically,\nwe propose an agent-independent method, for which all agents conduct a decision\nalgorithm independently but share a common structure based on Q-learning.\nFinally, simulation results reveal that: 1) appropriate parameters for\nexploitation and exploration are capable of enhancing the performance of the\nproposed MARL based resource allocation algorithm; 2) the proposed MARL\nalgorithm provides acceptable performance compared to the case with complete\ninformation exchanges among UAVs. By doing so, it strikes a good tradeoff\nbetween performance gains and information exchange overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 14:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

No assumption\nrequired to fit the classifier in both synthetic and real mobility. A numerical\nstudy is made to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\nmethod. The predicted AZ configuration can achieve an accuracy of 89.7%within\n98% of confidence level.

The method is applied to an ab initio database\nfor the N2-N system devel- oped at NASA Ames Research Center. The detailed\ninformation on N2 +N collisions contained in this database has been reduced by\nadapting a Uniform RoVibrational- Collisional bin model originally developed\nfor rate coefficients. Using a 10-bin system as an example, a comparison is\nmade between two sets of coarse-grain cross sections, obtained by analytical\ninversion and direct binning respectively. The analytical in- version approach\nis especially powerful, because it manages to compress the entire set of\nrovibrational-level-specific data from the Ames database into a much smaller\nset of numerical parameters, sufficient to reconstruct all coarse-grain cross\nsections for any particular N2 +N-collision pair. As a result of this approach,\nthe computational cost in in large-scale Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)\nflow simulations is sig- nificantly reduced, both in terms of memory\nrequirements and execution time. The intended application is the simulation of\nhigh-temperature gas-dynamics phenomena in shock-heated flows via the DSMC\nmethod. Such conditions are typically encoun- tered in high-altitude,\nhigh-speed atmospheric entry, or in shock-tube experiments. Using this\ncoarse-grain model together with ab initio rate data will enable more accu-\nrate modeling nonequilibrium phenomena, such as vibrationally-favored\ndissociation, an effect that is not well-captured by the conventional models\nprevalent in DSMC (i.e. Larsen-Borgnakke and Total Collision Energy).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-20"}

However,\norganizations are usually reluctant to share their network traces due to\nprivacy concerns over sensitive information, e.g., network and system\nconfiguration, which may potentially be exploited for attacks. In cases where\ndata owners are convinced to share their network traces, the data are typically\nsubjected to certain anonymization techniques, e.g., CryptoPAn, which replaces\nreal IP addresses with prefix-preserving pseudonyms. However, most such\ntechniques either are vulnerable to adversaries with prior knowledge about some\nnetwork flows in the traces, or require heavy data sanitization or\nperturbation, both of which may result in a significant loss of data utility.\nIn this paper, we aim to preserve both privacy and utility through shifting the\ntrade-off from between privacy and utility to between privacy and computational\ncost. The key idea is for the analysts to generate and analyze multiple\nanonymized views of the original network traces; those views are designed to be\nsufficiently indistinguishable even to adversaries armed with prior knowledge,\nwhich preserves the privacy, whereas one of the views will yield true analysis\nresults privately retrieved by the data owner, which preserves the utility. We\npresent the general approach and instantiate it based on CryptoPAn.

By using statistical learning theory, this study\npresents a framework to examine the tradeoff between estimation and\napproximation errors, and between prediction and interpretation losses. It\noperationalizes the DNN interpretability in the choice analysis by formulating\nthe metrics of interpretation loss as the difference between true and estimated\nchoice probability functions. This study also uses the statistical learning\ntheory to upper bound the estimation error of both prediction and\ninterpretation losses in DNN, shedding light on why DNN does not have the\noverfitting issue. Three scenarios are then simulated to compare DNN to binary\nlogit model (BNL). We found that DNN outperforms BNL in terms of both\nprediction and interpretation for most of the scenarios, and larger sample size\nunleashes the predictive power of DNN but not BNL.

Here we ask whether the\norganization of language in written text displays the fractal hierarchical\narchitecture common in systems optimized for efficient information\ntransmission. We test the hypothesis that the expositional structure of\nscientific research articles displays Rentian scaling, and that the exponent of\nthe scaling law changes as the article's information transmission capacity\nchanges. Using 32 scientific manuscripts - each containing between three and 26\niterations of revision - we construct semantic networks in which nodes\nrepresented unique words in each manuscript, and edges connect nodes if two\nwords appeared within the same 5-word window. We show that these semantic\nnetworks display clear Rentian scaling, and that the Rent exponent varies over\nthe publication life cycle, from the first draft to the final revision.\nFurthermore, we observe that manuscripts fell into three clusters in terms of\nhow the scaling exponents changed across drafts: exponents rising over time,\nfalling over time, and remaining relatively stable over time. This change in\nexponent reflects the evolution in semantic network structure over the\nmanuscript revision process, highlighting a balance between network complexity,\nwhich increases the exponent, and network efficiency, which decreases the\nexponent. Lastly, the final value of the Rent exponent is negatively correlated\nwith the number of authors. Taken together, our results suggest that semantic\nnetworks reflecting the structure of exposition in scientific research articles\ndisplay striking hierarchical architecture that arbitrates tradeoffs between\ncompeting constraints on network organization, and that this arbitration is\nnavigated differently depending on the social environment characteristic of the\ncollaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 12:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

Reducing\nthe interlayer spacing to 6.5 {\\AA}, an abrupt escalation occurs in water\npermeation between angstrom-distance graphene slabs. The change from disordered\nbulklike water to quasi-square structure have been found under this extremely\nconfined condition. This leads to a transition to subcontinuum transport. Water\nmolecules perform collective diffusion behaviors inside graphene channels.

This recently proposed method can\nbe used to compute derivatives of time-averaged objectives (also known as\nsensitivities) to system parameter(s) for chaotic systems. We propose a block\ndiagonal preconditioner, which is based on a partial singular value\ndecomposition of the MSS constraint matrix. The preconditioner can be computed\nusing matrix-vector products only (i.e. it is matrix-free) and is fully\nparallelised in the time domain. Two chaotic systems are considered, the Lorenz\nsystem and the 1D Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation. Combination of the\npreconditioner with a regularisation method leads to tight bracketing of the\neigenvalues to a narrow range. This combination results in a significant\nreduction in the number of iterations, and renders the convergence rate almost\nindependent of the number of degrees of freedom of the system, and the length\nof the trajectory that is used to compute the time-averaged objective. This can\npotentially allow the method to be used for large chaotic systems (such as\nturbulent flows) and optimal control applications. The singular value\ndecomposition of the constraint matrix can also be used to quantify the effect\nof the system condition on the accuracy of the sensitivities. In fact,\nneglecting the singular modes affected by noise, we recover the correct values\nof sensitivity that match closely with those obtained with finite differences\nfor the Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation in the light turbulent regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 08:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

This paper deals with the\nproblem of training multi-layer feedforward SNNs. The non-linear\nintegrate-and-fire dynamics employed by spiking neurons make it difficult to\ntrain SNNs to generate desired spike trains in response to a given input. To\ntackle this, first the problem of training a multi-layer SNN is formulated as\nan optimization problem such that its objective function is based on the\ndeviation in membrane potential rather than the spike arrival instants. Then,\nan optimization method named Normalized Approximate Descent (NormAD),\nhand-crafted for such non-convex optimization problems, is employed to derive\nthe iterative synaptic weight update rule. Next, it is reformulated to\nefficiently train multi-layer SNNs, and is shown to be effectively performing\nspatio-temporal error backpropagation. The learning rule is validated by\ntraining $2$-layer SNNs to solve a spike based formulation of the XOR problem\nas well as training $3$-layer SNNs for generic spike based training problems.\nThus, the new algorithm is a key step towards building deep spiking neural\nnetworks capable of efficient event-triggered learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:19:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 03:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

In this research, reasonable user behaviors changes i.e.,\ndetouring for recharging, is included in the method for more practical\napplication. A detailed logic for describing the plug-in electric vehicles\nusers' detour behaviors is designed in this paper for the charging station\ndeployment evaluation and further influence the later charging station planning\nstrategy formulation.
