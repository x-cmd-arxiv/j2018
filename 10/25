Although the\neffectiveness of software rejuvenation has been demonstrated for some simple\nsystems, many problems need to be addressed to make it viable for real\napplications. This paper expands the scope of CPS applications for which\nsoftware rejuvenation can be implemented by introducing architectural and\nalgorithmic features to support trajectory tracking. Following each software\nrefresh, while communication is still off, a safety controller is executed to\nassure the system state is within a sufficiently small neighborhood of the\ncurrent point on the reference trajectory.

Following each software refresh a\nsafety controller assures the CPS is driven to a safe state before returning to\nthe mission control mode when the CPS is again vulnerable attacks. This paper\nconsiders software rejuvenation design from a control-theoretic perspective.\nInvariant sets for the Lyapunov function for the safety controller are used to\nderive bounds on the time that the CPS can operate in mission control mode\nbefore the software must be refreshed and the maximum time the safety\ncontroller will require to bring the CPS to a safe operating state. With these\nresults it can be guaranteed that the CPS will remain safe under cyber attacks\nagainst the run-time system and will be able to execute missions successfully\nif the attacks are not persistent. The general approach is illustrated using\nsimulation of the nonlinear dynamics of a quadrotor system. The concluding\nsection discusses directions for further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 16:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

We examine and compare the three options.\nParticularly challenging are nonlinear interactions between strong waves, which\ndevelop a cascade to small dissipative scales. This process can be studied in\nthe framework of force-free electrodynamics (FFE). We perform three-dimensional\nFFE simulations to investigate Alfv\\'{e}n wave dissipation, how long it takes,\nand how it depends on the initial wave amplitude on the driving scale.

In this paper, we show interesting\neffects of deep-sleep-like slow oscillation activity on a simplified\nthalamo-cortical model which is trained to encode, retrieve and classify images\nof handwritten digits. During slow oscillations,\nspike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) produces a differential homeostatic\nprocess.

We observed 98\nstars with spectral types from B to M. Cool planets emit a larger share of\ntheir flux in $L^{\\prime}$ compared to shorter wavelengths, affording LEECH an\nadvantage in detecting low-mass, old, and cold-start giant planets. We\nemphasize proximity over youth in our target selection, probing physical\nseparations smaller than other direct imaging surveys. For FGK stars, LEECH\noutperforms many previous studies, placing tighter constraints on the hot-start\nplanet occurrence frequency interior to $\\sim20$ au. For less luminous,\ncold-start planets, LEECH provides the best constraints on giant-planet\nfrequency interior to $\\sim20$ au around FGK stars. Direct imaging survey\nresults depend sensitively on both the choice of evolutionary model (e.g., hot-\nor cold-start) and assumptions (explicit or implicit) about the shape of the\nunderlying planet distribution, in particular its radial extent. Artificially\nlow limits on the planet occurrence frequency can be derived when the shape of\nthe planet distribution is assumed to extend to very large separations, well\nbeyond typical protoplanetary dust-disk radii ($\\lesssim50$ au), and when\nhot-start models are used exclusively. We place a conservative upper limit on\nthe planet occurrence frequency using cold-start models and planetary\npopulation distributions that do not extend beyond typical protoplanetary\ndust-disk radii. We find that $\\lesssim90\\%$ of FGK systems can host a 7 to 10\n$M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ planet from 5 to 50 au. This limit leaves open the\npossibility that planets in this range are common.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 18:06:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 01:41:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 21:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

These estimates may be inaccurate if the non-local training data is\ndifferent from the local population of interest. This problem is a special case\nof transfer learning. However, most transfer learning classification approaches\nare concerned with individual (e.g. a person's) classification within a target\ndomain (e.g. a particular population) with training performed in data from a\nsource domain.

Effectively\nleveraging the array of hardware and software resources at a higher level, that\ncan adapt to the rapid development of software and hardware, will allow for\nfurther advancement and democratization of quantum technologies to achieve\nuseful computational tasks. As a way to approach this challenge, we present a\nflexible, high-level framework called algo2qpu that is well-suited for\ndesigning and testing instances of algorithms for near-term quantum computers\non the cloud. Algorithms that employ adaptive protocols for optimizations of\nalgorithm parameters can be grouped under the umbrella of \"adaptive hybrid\nquantum-classical\" (AHQC) algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of algo2qpu\nfor near-term algorithm development by applying the framework to implement\nproof-of-principle instances of two AHQC algorithms that have applications in\nquantum chemistry and/or quantum machine learning, namely the quantum\nautoencoder and the variational quantum classifier, using Rigetti Computing's\nForest platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 18:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

Constraints on new physics from such\nconsiderations are typically derived for a single unstable particle species\nwith a single well-defined mass and characteristic lifetime.

While MP2 performs similarly as\nB3LYP+XYG3, computational costs, i.e. timings, are increased by a factor of 4\nin comparison due to the large basis sets required for accurate results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 20:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

For example, when our\nstopped Weinstein manifold is a point stopped by itself, we find that any exact\nbrane in Euclidean space admits a Lagrangian cobordism to a disjoint union of\ncotangent fibers and a zero object. (This is a stronger statement than one\ncould obtain from purely Fukaya-categorical generation results.) Our methods\nare constructive. For example, when our Weinstein manifold is a point, after\nstabilization we can resolve the conormal to a compact manifold A of R^n by a\nsequence of cotangent fibers; the resulting filtration realizes, after passage\nto the wrapped Fukaya category, the Morse cochain complex of A associated to\n(and hence filtered by) a generic ``distance to a point'' function; the\nassociated gradeds are the reduced homologies of the Morse attaching spheres.\n  There is also an algebraic consequence.

Adsorbates exhibit strong intensity contrast in zero and higher order\nCBED spots, whereas lattice deformation such as strain or rippling cause\nnoticeable intensity contrast only in the first and higher order CBED spots.\nThe individual CBED spots can be reconstructed as typical in-line holograms,\nand the resolution of 2.13 A can be in principle achieved in the\nreconstructions. We provide simulated and experimental examples of CBED of a 2D\nmonolayer crystal. The simulations show that individual CBED spots can be\ntreated as in-line holograms and sample distributions such as adsorbates, can\nbe reconstructed.

Although it delivers provably good performances,\nthe effectiveness of its underlying load balancing strategy is known to be\nlimited for certain classes of computations, particularly the ones exhibiting\nirregular parallelism (e.g. depth first searches). Many studies have addressed\nthis limitation from a purely load balancing perspective, viewing computations\nas sets of independent tasks, and then analyzing the expected amount of work\nattached to each processor as the execution progresses. However, these studies\nmake strong assumptions regarding work generation which, despite being standard\nfrom a queuing theory perspective --- where work generation can be assumed to\nfollow some random distribution --- do not match the reality of structured\nparallel computations --- where the work generation is not random, only\ndepending on the structure of a computation.\n  In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for studying the performance\nof structured computation schedulers, define a criterion that is appropriate\nfor measuring their performance, and present a methodology for analyzing the\nperformance of randomized schedulers.

In the absence of a\ndriving force, the particles form a triangular lattice, while when a driving\nforce is applied, we find that there is a critical drive above which a\nMagnus-induced disordering transition can occur even if the difference in the\nMagnus term between the two particle species is as small as one percent. The\ntransition arises due to the different Hall angles of the two species, which\ncauses their motion to decouple at the critical drive. At higher drives, the\ndisordered state can undergo both species and density phase separation into a\ndensity modulated stripe that is oriented perpendicular to the driving\ndirection. We observe several additional phases that occur as a function of\ndrive and Magnus force disparity, including a variety of density modulated\ndiagonal laned phases. In general we find a much richer variety of states\ncompared to systems of oppositely driven overdamped Yukawa particles. We\ndiscuss the implications of our work for skyrmion systems, where we predict\nthat even for small skyrmion dispersities, a drive-induced disordering\ntransition can occur along with clustering phases and pattern forming states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 22:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

As a first step, this paper aims to characterize the galaxies that\nhost the QSOs. To achieve this, a sample of 13 hyper-luminous (L_AGN>10^14\nL_odot) QSOs with previous submillimetre continuum detections were followed up\nwith CO(3-2) observations using the NOEMA interferometer.

In three of the fields, a companion\npotentially suitable for tomography is detected in CO line emission within 25\narcsec of the QSO. We derive gas masses, dynamical masses and far-infrared\nluminosities, and show that the QSOs in our sample have similar properties as\ncompared to less luminous QSOs and SMGs in the literature, despite the fact\nthat their black-hole masses (which are proportional to L_AGN) are 1-2 orders\nof magnitude larger.

The anomaly excesses point to evidence of\ncoherent photon-nucleus interactions in violent hadronic heavy-ion collisions,\nwhich were conventionally studied only in ultra-peripheral collisions. Assuming\nthat the coherent photoproduction is the underlying mechanism which is\nresponsible for the excess observed in peripheral A+A collisions, its\ncontribution in p+p collisions with nuclear overlap, i.e.\nnon-single-diffractive collisions, is of particular interest. In this paper, we\nperform a calculation of exclusive J/$\\psi$ photoproduction in\nnon-single-diffractive p+p collisions at RHIC and LHC energies base on the pQCD\nmotivated parametrization from world-wide experimental data, which could be\nfurther employed to improve the precision of phenomenal calculations for\nphotoproduction in A+A collisions.

We demonstrate the advances in grain alignment theory allow the use of\nlinear and circular polarization to probe not only the magnetic field, but also\ndust composition, the dust environment, etc. We revisit the process of grain\nalignment by Radiative Torques (RATs) and focus on constraining magnetic\nsusceptibility of grains via observations. We discuss the possibility of\nobservational testing of the magnetic properties of grains as the alignment\nchanges from being in respect to the magnetic field to being in respect to the\nradiation direction. This opens both a possibility of constraining the\nuncertain parameters of the RATs theory and provides a new way of measuring\nmagnetic fields in interstellar medium and circumstellar regions. We provide a\ndetailed discussion of the precession induced both by the magnetic field and\nthe anisotropic radiation and revisit a number of key processes related to\nmagnetic response of the grains. We consider various effects that increase the\nrate of magnetic relaxation both in silicate and carbonaceous grains. In\nparticular, we find a new relaxation process related to the change of the\namplitude of internal magnetization within a wobbling triaxial grain and\nidentify a range of grain sizes in which this effect can dominate the internal\nalignment of angular momentum within grain axes. We show that these relaxation\nprocesses significantly change the dynamics of grains in the presence of RATs.\nWe apply our analysis for observed grain alignment in special environments to\nput constraints on the enhanced magnetic properties of dust grains in the cloud\nnear supernovae, in cometary coma, and protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 02:06:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 01:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

In\nthis article, we present a double-slit scenario at fermi scale with new\nentities -- coherent photon products in heavy-ion collisions. Virtual photons\nfrom the electromagnetic fields of relativistic heavy ions can fluctuate to\nquark-antiquark pairs, scatter off a target nucleus and emerge as vector\nmesons. The two colliding nuclei can take turns to act as targets, forming a\ndouble-slit interference pattern.

However, in the big data era, to\ncomplete tasks on one device is still challenging. As an emerging technology,\ncrowdsourcing utilizing crowds of devices to facilitate large scale sensing\ntasks has gaining more and more research attention. Most of existing works\neither assume devices are willing to cooperate utilizing centralized mechanisms\nor design incentive algorithms using double auctions. Which is not practical to\ndeal with the case when there is a lack of centralized controller for the\nformer, and not suitable to the case when the seller device is also resource\nconstrained for the later. In this paper, we propose a truthful incentive\nmechanism with combinatorial double auction for crowd sensing task assignment\nin device-to-device (D2D) clouds, where a single mobile device with intensive\nsensing task can hire a group of idle neighboring devices. With this new\nmechanism, time critical sensing tasks can be handled in time with a\ndistributed nature. We prove that the proposed mechanism is truthful,\nindividual rational, budget balance and computational efficient. Our simulation\nresults demonstrate that combinatorial double auction mechanism gets a 26.3%\nand 15.8% gains in comparison to existing double auction scheme and the\ncentralized maximum matching based algorithm respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 02:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

This is the principle behind Hopf's\nlemma relating the Gauss map and the index of a vector field. All vector fields\nof the de Medeiros type are co-bordant to the Milnor-Hopf vector field. This\nlatter comes from a non-derogatory, real diagonal endomorphism, so clearly\npossesses an eigen-vector. Therefore so has the given arbitrary endomorphism.\nThe main theorem on complex polynomials naturally follows, using the companion\nmatrix, secular polynomial reciprocity.

This paper builds on many previous\nworks in the literature which seek to elucidate the varied instrumental and\nforeground factors which contribute to these familiar structures in the 2D\npower spectrum.

The equivalent MIMO water-filling (WF-MIMO)\nchannel capacity was treated as an unsurpassed SE upper bound. Recently,\nresearchers have proposed various schemes trying to approach the benchmark and\nthe performance bound. But, are they the real limit of mmWave MIMO systems with\nreduced radio-frequency (RF) chains? In this paper, we challenge the benchmark\nand the corresponding bound by proposing a better transmission scheme that\nachieves higher SE, namely the Generalized Beamspace Modulation using\nMultiplexing (GBMM). Inspired by the concept of spatial modulation, besides the\nselected beamspace, the selection operation is used to carry information.

We\ninvestigate SE-oriented precoder activation probability optimization,\nfully-digital precoder design, optimal power allocation and hybrid precoder\ndesign for GBMM. A gradient ascent algorithm is developed to find the optimal\nsolution, which is applicable in all signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regimes. The\nbest solution is derived in the high SNR regime.

The problem of optical blurring is a common\ndisadvantage to many imaging applications that suffer from optical\nimperfections. Despite numerous deconvolution methods that blindly estimate\nblurring in either inclusive or exclusive forms, they are practically\nchallenging due to high computational cost and low image reconstruction\nquality. Both conditions of high accuracy and high speed are prerequisites for\nhigh-throughput imaging platforms in digital archiving. In such platforms,\ndeblurring is required after image acquisition before being stored, previewed,\nor processed for high-level interpretation. Therefore, on-the-fly correction of\nsuch images is important to avoid possible time delays, mitigate computational\nexpenses, and increase image perception quality. We bridge this gap by\nsynthesizing a deconvolution kernel as a linear combination of Finite Impulse\nResponse (FIR) even-derivative filters that can be directly convolved with\nblurry input images to boost the frequency fall-off of the Point Spread\nFunction (PSF) associated with the optical blur. We employ a Gaussian low-pass\nfilter to decouple the image denoising problem for image edge deblurring.\nFurthermore, we propose a blind approach to estimate the PSF statistics for two\nGaussian and Laplacian models that are common in many imaging pipelines.\nThorough experiments are designed to test and validate the efficiency of the\nproposed method using 2054 naturally blurred images across six imaging\napplications and seven state-of-the-art deconvolution methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 05:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 16:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

In this\npaper it is proved that fault as well as bad current measurement data can be\nmodeled as control failure for the power transmission network and any fault on\nthe transmission line can be treated as multiple bad data. Subsequently a\nlinear observer theory is designed in order to identify the fault type and bad\ndata simultaneously. The state space model based observer theory allows a\nparticular failure mode manifest itself as residual which remains in a fixed\ndirection. Moreover coordinate transformation is performed to allow the\nresidual for each failure mode to generate specific geometry characteristic in\nseparate output dimensions. The design approach based on the observer theory is\npresented in this paper. The design allows 1) bad data detection for current\nmeasurement, and 2) fault location, and fault resistance estimation (as a\nbyproduct) where the fault location accuracy is not affected by fault\nresistance. However it loses freedom in designing the eigenvalues in the\nexcessive subspace. While the theoretical framework is general, the analysis\nand design are dedicated to transmission lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 08:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

In an\nactive region close to the limb, we observed a unipolar annular network of\nsupergranular size. This supergranular structure harbours a radial distribution\nof the fibrils converging towards its centre.

The time scale of this event is t_E = 40.0 +- 0.5 days and the\nmass ratio between the lens star and its companion is q = 0.016 +- 0.002. The\nplanetary perturbation in the light curve is a smooth bump, resulting in the\nclassical binary-lens/binary-source (2L1S/1L2S) degeneracy. We measure the V -\nI color of the (putative) two sources in the 1L2S model, and then effectively\nrule out the binary source solution. The finite-source effect is marginally\ndetected. Combined with the limits on the blend flux and the probability\ndistribution of the source size normalized by the Einstein radius rho, a\nBayesian analysis yields the lens mass M_L = 0.45+0.33-0.28 M_sun, at distance\nof D_L = 6.60+1.10-1.30 kpc. Thus the companion is a super-Jupiter of a mass\nm_p = 7.0+5.2-4.3 M_J , at a projected separation r = 5.1+1.5-1.7 AU,\nindicating that the planet is well beyond the snow line of the host star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 09:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

Nevertheless, human-driven techniques\nremain cumbersome and notoriously difficult while automated approaches suffer\nfrom limited applicability. The main obstacle for automation is the complexity\nof concurrent data structures. This is particularly true in the absence of\ngarbage collection. The intricacy of lock-free memory management paired with\nthe complexity of concurrent data structures makes automated verification\nprohibitive.\n  In this work we present a method for verifying concurrent data structures and\ntheir memory management separately. We suggest two simpler verification tasks\nthat imply the correctness of the data structure. The first task establishes an\nover-approximation of the reclamation behavior of the memory management. The\nsecond task exploits this over-approximation to verify the data structure\nwithout the need to consider the implementation of the memory management\nitself.

The samples of 211\nM-class and X-class flares, which were observed between 2006 and 2015 by\nHinode/X-ray telescope, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and\nSpectrometric Coronagraph, and GOES, were examined statistically. Five kinds of\nanalysis were performed: Occurrence rate analysis, linear-correlation analysis,\nassociation analysis, the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test, and Anderson-Darling test.\nThe analyses show three main results. First, the sigmoidal structure and long\nduration events (LDEs) has stronger dependency on the CME occurrence than large\nX-ray class events in on-disk events. Second, for the limb events, the\nsignificant dependency exists between LDEs and CME occurrence, and between\nX-ray class and CME occurrence. Third, there existed 32.4% of on-disk flare\nevents, which had sigmoidal structure and were not accompanied by CMEs.\nHowever, the occurrence probability of CMEs without sigmoidal structures is\nvery small, 8.8 %, in on-disk events. While the first and second results are\nconsistent with previous studies, we newly provided the difference between the\non-disk events and limb events. The third result that non-sigmoidal regions\nproduce less eruptive events is also different from previous results. We\nsuggest that sigmoidal structures in soft X-ray images will be a helpful\nfeature for CME prediction regarding on-disk flare events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 09:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

It has provided a wealth of data on solar\nflares, perhaps most uniquely, on the Lyman spectrum of hydrogen at high\ncadence and moderate spectral resolution. In this paper we concentrate on the\nanalysis of Lyman continuum (LyC) observations and its temporal evolution in a\nsample of six major solar flares. By fitting both the pre-flare and flare\nexcess spectra with a blackbody function we show that the color temperature\nderived from the slope of LyC reveals temperatures in excess of 10$^{4}$ K in\nthe six events studied; an increase of a few thousand Kelvin above quiet-Sun\nvalues (typically $\\sim$8000-9500 K). This was found to be as high as 17000 K\nfor the 2017 September 6 X9.3 flare. Using these temperature values, and\nassuming a flaring area of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{2}$, estimates of the departure\ncoefficient of hydrogen, $b_1$, were calculated. It was found that $b_1$\ndecreased from 10$^{2}$-10$^{3}$ in the quiet-Sun, to around unity during the\nflares.

In\nparticular, there are emerging UAV applications such as aerial photograph and\ndata relaying that require high-speed communications between the UAVs and the\nground base stations (GBSs). Due to the high UAV altitude, the strong\nline-of-sight (LoS) links generally dominate the channels between the UAVs and\nGBSs, which brings both opportunities and challenges in the design of future\nwireless networks supporting both terrestrial and aerial users. Although each\nUAV can associate with more GBSs for communication as compared to terrestrial\nusers thanks to the LoS-dominant channels, it also causes/suffers more severe\ninterference to/from the terrestrial communications in the uplink/downlink.\nThis paper studies the uplink communication from a multi-antenna UAV to a set\nof GBSs within its signal coverage by considering a practical yet challenging\nscenario when the number of antennas at the UAV is smaller than that of\nco-channel GBSs. To achieve high-rate transmission yet avoid interfering with\nany of the existing terrestrial communications at the co-channel GBSs, we\npropose a novel multi-beam transmission strategy by exploiting the\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, the UAV sends\neach data stream to a selected subset of the GBSs, which can decode the UAV's\nsignals and then cancel them before decoding the messages of their served\nterrestrial users, and in the meanwhile nulls its interference at the other\nGBSs via zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming. To draw essential insight, we first\ncharacterize in closed-form the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) under the proposed\nstrategy. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the UAV's\ntransmit rate subject to the interference avoidance constraints for protecting\nthe terrestrial users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 12:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

Migration to microservices is one of\nthe most common situations when companies adopt continuous architecting\nprocesses [4]. Companies commonly adopt an initial migration strategy to\nextract some components from the monolithic system as microservices, making use\nof simplified microservices patterns [5][4]. As an example, companies commonly\ndirectly connect the microservices to the legacy monolithic system and do not\nadopt any message bus at the beginning. When the system starts to grow in\ncomplexity, they usually start re-architecting their systems, considering\ndifferent architectural patterns. Some companies introduce API gateway patterns\nto simplify the management and load balancing of the different services, while\nothers also consider a lightweight message bus [4][5][6]. All these\narchitectural changes require deep refactoring of the system, thereby\nincreasing the risk of new faults being introduced. In this paper, we report\nthe preliminary results of work in progress, where we monitored the TD of an\nSME (SMEs = small and medium enterprises) that adopted a CA approach while\nmigrating a legacy monolithic system to an ecosystem of microservices.

We benchmark a comprehensive list of 365 file formats,\ntransparent data transformations, and lossless compression algorithms. The\nprimary goal is to reduce the overall dataset size while maintaining an\neasy-to-use file format and access API. We show that with careful selection of\nfile format and encoding scheme, we can reduce the size of some datasets by up\nto 73%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 14:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

In this\nwork, we present SAMSON, an innovative system to automatically classify\nmultiple types of algae from different phyla groups by combining standard\nmorphological features with their multi-wavelength signals. Two phyla with\nfocused investigation in this study are the Cyanophyta phylum (blue-green\nalgae), and the Chlorophyta phylum (green algae). We use a custom-designed\nmicroscopy imaging system which is configured to image water samples at two\nfluorescent wavelengths and seven absorption wavelengths using\ndiscrete-wavelength high-powered light emitting diodes (LEDs). Powered by\ncomputer vision and machine learning, we investigate the possibility and\neffectiveness of automatic classification using a deep residual convolutional\nneural network. More specifically, a classification accuracy of 96% was\nachieved in an experiment conducted with six different algae types. This high\nlevel of accuracy was achieved using a deep residual convolutional neural\nnetwork that learns the optimal combination of spectral and morphological\nfeatures. These findings elude to the possibility of leveraging a unique\nfingerprint of algae cell (i.e. spectral wavelengths and morphological\nfeatures) to automatically distinguish different algae types.

Second, a $Na^+$\ncurrent leads to a large increase in the ciliary $Na^+$ concentration during an\nodorant response. This increase inhibits and even reverses $Ca^{2+}$ clearance\nby $Na^+/Ca^{2+}/K^+$ exchange, which is essential for response termination.\nFinally, a $Na^+$ current increases the ciliary osmotic pressure, which could\ncause swelling to damage the cilia.

One of the most appealing as well as\nchallenging applications is the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) utilizing\nsmart phones. Conventional HAR based on Support Vector Machine relies on\nsubjective manually extracted features. This approach is time and energy\nconsuming as well as immature in prediction due to the partial view toward\nwhich features to be extracted by human. With the rise of deep learning,\nartificial intelligence has been making progress toward being a mature\ntechnology. This paper proposes a new approach based on deep learning and\ntraditional feature engineering called HAR-Net to address the issue related to\nHAR. The study used the data collected by gyroscopes and acceleration sensors\nin android smart phones. The raw sensor data was put into the HAR-Net proposed.\nThe HAR-Net fusing the hand-crafted features and high-level features extracted\nfrom convolutional network to make prediction. The performance of the proposed\nmethod was proved to be 0.9% higher than the original MC-SVM approach.

The most widely used models of this type, resource selection\nfunctions, assume independence between the observed locations of an animal.\nThis is unrealistic when location data display spatio-temporal autocorrelation.\nAlternatively, step selection functions embed habitat selection in a model of\nanimal movement, to account for the autocorrelation. However, inferences from\nstep selection functions depend on the movement model, and they cannot readily\nbe used to predict long-term space use. We recently suggested that a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm could define a step selection model with an\nexplicit stationary distribution: the target distribution. Here, we explain how\nthe likelihood of a MCMC step selection model is derived, and how maximum\nlikelihood estimation can be used for inference about parameters of movement\nand habitat selection.

But amortized data structures are not suitable\nfor real-time systems, where each individual operation has to be executed\nquickly. For this reason, there exist many recent randomized results that aim\nto provide a guarantee stronger than amortized expected. The strongest possible\nguarantee for a randomized algorithm is that it is always correct (Las Vegas),\nand has high-probability worst-case update time, which gives a bound on the\ntime for each individual operation that holds with high probability.\n  In this paper we present the first polylogarithmic high-probability\nworst-case time bounds for the dynamic spanner and the dynamic maximal matching\nproblem. 1. For dynamic spanner, the only known $o(n)$ worst-case bounds were\n$O(n^{3/4})$ high-probability worst-case update time for maintaining a\n3-spanner and $O(n^{5/9})$ for maintaining a 5-spanner. We give a $O(1)^k\n\\log^3(n)$ high-probability worst-case time bound for maintaining a\n$(2k-1)$-spanner, which yields the first worst-case polylog update time for all\nconstant $k$. (All the results above maintain the optimal tradeoff of stretch\n$2k-1$ and $\\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/k})$ edges.) 2. For dynamic maximal matching, or\ndynamic $2$-approximate maximum matching, no algorithm with $o(n)$ worst-case\ntime bound was known and we present an algorithm with $O(\\log^5(n))$\nhigh-probability worst-case time; similar worst-case bounds existed only for\nmaintaining a matching that was $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximate, and hence not\nmaximal.\n  Our results are achieved using a new black-box reduction that converts any\ndata structure with worst-case expected update time into one with a\nhigh-probability worst-case update time: the query time remains the same, while\nthe update time increases by a factor of $O(\\log^2(n))$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 13:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

According to Gruber, an ontology\ndefines the primitives with which to model the knowledge resources for a\ncommunity of discourse. These primitives, consisting of classes, relationships\nand properties, are represented by the entity-relationship-attribute ERA data\nmodel of Chen. An ontology uses formal axioms to constrain the interpretation\nof these primitives. In short, an ontology specifies a logical theory. A series\nof three papers by the author provide a rigorous mathematical representation\nfor the ERA data model in particular, and ontologies in general, within FOLE.\nThe first two papers, which provide a foundation and superstructure for FOLE,\nrepresent the formalism and semantics of (many-sorted) first-order logic in a\nclassification form corresponding to ideas discussed in the Information Flow\nFramework (IFF). The third paper will define an interpretation of FOLE in terms\nof the transformational passage, first described in (Kent, 2013), from the\nclassification form of first-order logic to an equivalent interpretation form,\nthereby defining the formalism and semantics of first-order logical/relational\ndatabase systems. Two papers will provide a precise mathematical basis for FOLE\ninterpretation: the current paper develops the notion of a FOLE relational\ntable following the relational model of Codd, and a follow-up paper will\ndevelop the notion of a FOLE relational database. Both of these papers expand\non material found in the paper (Kent, 2011). Although the classification form\nfollows the entity-relationship-attribute data model of Chen, the\ninterpretation form follows the relational data model of Codd. In general, the\nFOLE representation uses a conceptual structures approach, that is completely\ncompatible with formal concept analysis and information flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2018 18:24:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 08:19:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 00:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 18:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}
