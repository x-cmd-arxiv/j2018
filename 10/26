Due to the\nwidespread use of smartphones and to the inclusion of various sensors in all\ncontemporary smartphones (e.g., accelerometers and gyroscopes), they are\ncommonly used for extracting and collecting data from sensors and even for\nimplementing HAR systems.

As observation error covariance matrices are often\nobtained by sampling methods, estimates are often degenerate or\nill-conditioned, making it impossible to invert an observation error covariance\nmatrix without the use of techniques to reduce its condition number. In this\npaper we present new theory for two existing methods that can be used to\n'recondition' any covariance matrix: ridge regression, and the minimum\neigenvalue method. We compare these methods with multiplicative variance\ninflation. We investigate the impact of reconditioning on variances and\ncorrelations of a general covariance matrix in both a theoretical and practical\nsetting. Improved theoretical understanding provides guidance to users\nregarding method selection, and choice of target condition number. The new\ntheory shows that, for the same target condition number, both methods increase\nvariances compared to the original matrix, with larger increases for ridge\nregression than the minimum eigenvalue method. We prove that the ridge\nregression method strictly decreases the absolute value of off-diagonal\ncorrelations. Theoretical comparison of the impact of reconditioning and\nmultiplicative variance inflation on the data assimilation objective function\nshows that variance inflation alters information across all scales uniformly,\nwhereas reconditioning has a larger effect on scales corresponding to smaller\neigenvalues.

The discreteness of\nPRNG outputs and the limited state space of common PRNGs cause those algorithms\nto perform poorly in practice. Statistics packages and scientific programming\nlanguages should use cryptographically secure PRNGs by default (not for their\nsecurity properties, but for their statistical ones), and offer weaker PRNGs\nonly as an option. Software should not use methods that assume PRNG outputs are\nIID $U[0,1)$ random variables, such as generating a random sample by permuting\nthe population and taking the first $k$ items or generating random integers by\nmultiplying a pseudo-random binary fraction or float by a constant and rounding\nthe result. More accurate methods are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 17:18:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 16:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

This model, GLTofDE, surprisingly provides a framework to\nstudy not only temporal tensions in cosmology e.g. $H_0$ tension but also\nspatial anomalies of CMB e.g. the hemispherical power asymmetry and\nquadrupole-octopole alignment. In the mean field (or Landau) approximation of\nGLTofDE, there is a spontaneously symmetry breaking exactly like the Higgs\npotential. We modeled this transition, phenomenologically, and showed that\nGLTofDE can resolve both the $H_0$ tension and Lyman-$\\alpha$ anomaly in a\nnon-trivial way. According to $\\chi^2$-analysis the transition happens at\n$z_t=0.738\\pm0.028$ while $H_0=71.89\\pm0.93$ km/s/Mpc and\n$\\Omega^{like}_{k}=-0.225\\pm0.049$ which are consistent with the latest $H(z)$\nreconstructions. In addition, the GLTofDE proposes a framework to address the\nCMB anomalies when it is considered beyond the mean field approximation. In\nthis regime existence of a long wavelength mode is a typical consequence which\nis named the Goldstone mode in the case of continuous symmetries. This mode,\nwhich is an automatic byproduct in GLTofDE, makes cosmological constant,\ndirection dependent. This means one side of the sky should be colder than the\nother side in agreement with what has been already observed in CMB. In addition\nbetween initial stochastic pattern and the final state with one long wavelength\nmode, we can observe smaller patches or protrusions of the biggest remaining\npatch in the simulation. Our simulations show these protrusions are few in\nnumbers and will be evolved according to Alan-Cahn mechanism. These protrusions\ncan give an additional effect on CMB which is the existence of aligned\nquadrupole-octopole mode and its direction should be orthogonal to the dipole\ndirection. We conclude that GLTofDE is a fertile framework both theoretically\nand phenomenologically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 17:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 08:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 13:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

Differential dynamical friction effects combine\nwith diffusion in creating a bimodality in the BSS distribution and determining\nits evolution, driving the migration of the minimum to larger radii over time.\nThe diffusion coefficient is strongly constrained by the need to reproduce the\nmigratory behaviour of the minimum, and the radial dependence of diffusion set\nby fundamental physical arguments automatically satisfies this constraint.\nTherefore, our model appears to capture the fluctuation-dissipation dynamics\nthat underpins the dynamical clock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Ordinary Bayesian credible intervals suffer from\nselection bias, owing to the fact that the target of inference is chosen\nadaptively. Existing Bayesian approaches for correcting this bias produce\ncredible intervals with poor frequentist properties, while existing frequentist\napproaches require sacrificing the benefits of shrinkage typical in Bayesian\nmethods, resulting in confidence intervals that are needlessly wide.

DSA preconditioners\naddress the need to accelerate solving SN transport when the mean free path\n$\\varepsilon$ of particles is small and the condition number of the SN\ntransport equation scales like $O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$. By expanding the SN\ntransport operator in $\\varepsilon$ and employing a singular matrix\nperturbation analysis, we derive a DSA matrix that reduces to the symmetric\ninterior penalty (SIP) DG discretization of diffusion when the mesh is\nfirst-order and the total opacity is constant. We prove that preconditioning HO\nDG SN transport with the SIP DSA matrix results in an $O(\\varepsilon)$\nperturbation of the identity, and fixed-point iteration therefore converges\nrapidly for optically thick problems.

Traditionally, machine learning\napproaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding\nstructural information about data. However, recently there has been a surge in\napproaches that learn how to encode the data automatically in a low dimensional\nspace. Exponential family embedding provides a probabilistic framework for\nlearning low-dimensional representation for various types of high-dimensional\ndata. Though successful in practice, theoretical underpinnings for exponential\nfamily embeddings have not been established. In this paper, we study the\nGaussian embedding model and develop the first theoretical results for\nexponential family embedding models. First, we show that, under mild condition,\nthe embedding structure can be learned from one observation by leveraging the\nparameter sharing between different contexts even though the data are dependent\nwith each other. Second, we study properties of two algorithms used for\nlearning the embedding structure and establish convergence results for each of\nthem. The first algorithm is based on a convex relaxation, while the other\nsolved the non-convex formulation of the problem directly.

When the nematic director is subject to planar degenerate\nboundary conditions, the bend-only director field with vector lines along the\nparallels of all internal torodial shells is an equilibrium solution for all\nvalues of the elastic constants. Local stability analyses have shown that an\ninstability is expected to occur for sufficiently small values of the twist\nelastic constant. It is natural to conjecture that in this regime the global\nequilibrium would be characterized by a maximum twist deflection on the\nboundary of the torus, with a twist distribution over the torus' cross-section\nrepresented by a fennel-like surface. We prove that surprisingly the stable\ntwist distribution is instead represented by a lily-like surface. Thus the\noverall maximum twist deflection falls well within the torus.

The behavior of the flow is\neither dominated by purely turbulent phenomena or by the generation of sound\nwaves in it. Previous studies suggest that three different types of turbulence\nmay happen at the low Mach number limit in polytropic flows: Nearly\nincompressible (NI), modally equipartitioned compressible (MEC) and\ncompressible wave (CW). The distinction between these types of turbulence is\ninvestigated here applying different kinds of forcing. Scaling of density\nfluctuations with Mach number, comparison of the ratio of transverse velocity\nfluctuations to longitudinal fluctuations and spectral decomposition of\nfluctuations are used to distinguish the nature of these solutions. From the\nstudy of the spatio-temporal spectra and correlation times we quantify the\ncontribution of the waves to the total energy of the system. Also, in the\ndynamics of a compressible flow, three associated correlation times are\nconsidered: the non-linear time of local interaction between scales, the\nsweeping time or non-local time of large scales on small scales, and the time\nassociated with acoustic waves (sound). We observed that different correlation\ntimes dominate depending on the wave number (k), the Mach number and the type\nof forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 22:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

Our results establish a new\napproach for the study of SOI in epitaxial conducting oxide heterostructures\nand confirm SrRuO3 as a promising candidate material for achieving new and\nenhanced spintronics functionalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 23:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

An impact on the surface of a dense\nsuspension can trigger this jamming process by generating a shear front that\npropagates into the bulk of the system. Tracking and visualizing such a front\nis difficult because suspensions are optically opaque and the front can\npropagate as fast as several meters per second. Recently, high-speed ultrasound\nimaging has been used to overcome this problem and extract two-dimensional\nsections of the flow field associated with jamming front propagation. Here we\nextend this method to reconstruct the three-dimensional flow field. This\nenables us to investigate the evolution of jamming fronts for which axisymmetry\ncannot be assumed, such as impact at angles tilted away from the normal to the\nfree surface of the suspension. We find that sufficiently far from solid\nboundaries the resulting flow field is approximately identical to that\ngenerated by normal impact, but rotated and aligned with the angle of impact.\nHowever, once the front approaches the solid boundary at the bottom of the\ncontainer, it generates a squeeze flow that deforms the front profile and\ncauses jamming to proceed in a non-axisymmetric manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 01:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 16:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-10"}

This\nresult holds no matter which sample of LBVs we employ. A statistical test shows\nthat we can rule out the LBVs having the same distribution as the RSGs, which\nare about 2x more isolated. We demonstrate the robustness of our results using\nthe second-closest neighbor. Furthermore, the majority of LBVs in the LMC are\nfound in or near OB associations as are the BBS and WRs; the RSGs are not. We\nconclude that the spatial distribution of LBVs therefore is consistent with the\nstandard picture of massive star evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 03:12:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 18:46:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 18:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

We describe a smart solar inverter system with battery which can either\noperate in an automatic mode or receive commands over a network to charge and\ndischarge at a given rate. In order to make battery storage financially viable\nand advantageous to the consumers, effective battery scheduling algorithms can\nbe employed. Particularly, when time-of-use tariffs are in effect in the region\nof the inverter, it is possible in some cases to schedule the battery to save\nmoney for the individual customer, compared to the \"automatic\" mode. Hence,\nthis paper presents and evaluates the performance of a novel battery scheduling\nalgorithm for residential consumers of solar energy. The proposed battery\nscheduling algorithm optimizes the cost of electricity over next 24 hours for\nresidential consumers. The cost minimization is realized by controlling the\ncharging/discharging of battery storage system based on the predictions for\nload and solar power generation values. The scheduling problem is formulated as\na linear programming problem. We performed computer simulations over 83\ninverters using several months of hourly load and PV data. The simulation\nresults indicate that key factors affecting the viability of optimization are\nthe tariffs and the PV to Load ratio at each inverter. Depending on the tariff,\nsavings of between 1% and 10% can be expected over the automatic approach. The\nprediction approach used in this paper is also shown to out-perform basic\n\"persistence\" forecasting approaches.

In this paper, we propose a new network structure, known as\nRedundancy Reduction Attention (RRA), which learns to focus on multiple\ndiscriminative patterns by sup- pressing redundant feature channels.\nSpecifically, it firstly summarizes the video by weight-summing all feature\nvectors in the feature maps of selected frames with a spatio-temporal soft\nattention, and then predicts which channels to suppress or to enhance according\nto this summary with a learned non-linear transform. Suppression is achieved by\nmodulating the feature maps and threshing out weak activations. The updated\nfeature maps are then used in the next iteration. Finally, the video is\nclassified based on multiple summaries. The proposed method achieves out-\nstanding performances in multiple video classification datasets.

Results indicated\nthat wild prey constituted 94.9% of the total biomass consumed by tigers;\ndomestic livestock represented 5.1% of the diet. Two species, wild boar and\nsika deer , collectively represented 83% of the biomass consumed by tigers.\nDespite lower spatial overlap of tigers and wild boar compared to tigers and\nsika deer, tigers preferentially preyed on boar, likely facilitated by high\ntemporal overlap in activity patterns.

A\nchallenge is automatic control of laser bone ablation with 4D optical coherence\ntomography (OCT). OCT as high resolution imaging modality provides volumetric\nimages of tissue and foresees information of bone position and orientation\n(pose) as well as thickness. However, existing approaches for OCT based laser\nablation control rely on external tracking systems or invasively ablated\nartificial landmarks for tracking the pose of the OCT probe relative to the\ntissue. This can be superseded by estimating the scene flow caused by relative\nmovement between OCT-based laser ablation system and patient.\n  Therefore, this paper deals with 2.5D scene flow estimation of volumetric OCT\nimages for application in laser ablation. We present a semi-supervised\nconvolutional neural network based tracking scheme for subsequent 3D OCT\nvolumes and apply it to a realistic semi-synthetic data set of ex vivo human\ntemporal bone specimen. The scene flow is estimated in a two-stage approach. In\nthe first stage, 2D lateral scene flow is computed on census-transformed\nen-face arguments-of-maximum intensity projections. Subsequent to this, the\nprojections are warped by predicted lateral flow and 1D depth flow is\nestimated. The neural network is trained semi-supervised by combining error to\nground truth and the reconstruction error of warped images with assumptions of\nspatial flow smoothness. Quantitative evaluation reveals a mean endpoint error\nof $ (4.7\\pm{}3.5) $ voxel or $ 27.5 \\pm 20.5 \\mu\\mathrm{m} $ for scene flow\nestimation caused by simulated relative movement between the OCT probe and\nbone.

In an attempt to\nidentify disk-like structures embedded at small scales in the protostellar\nenvelopes, we model the dust continuum emission visibility profiles using both\nPlummer-like envelope models and envelope models including additional Gaussian\ndisk-like components.\n  Our analysis shows that in the CALYPSO sample, 11 of the 16 Class 0\nprotostars are better reproduced by models including a disk-like dust continuum\ncomponent contributing to the flux at small scales, but less than 25% of these\ncandidate protostellar disks are resolved at radii > 60 au. Including all\navailable literature constraints on Class 0 disks at subarcsecond scales, we\nshow that our results are representative: most (> 72% in a sample of 26\nprotostars) Class 0 protostellar disks are small and emerge only at radii < 60\nau. Our multiplicity fraction at scales 100-5000 au is in global agreement with\nthe multiplicity properties of Class I protostars at similar scales.\n  We confront our observational constraints on the disk size distribution in\nClass 0 protostars to the typical disk properties from protostellar formation\nmodels. Because they reduce the centrifugal radius, and produce a disk size\ndistribution peaking at radii <100 au during the main accretion phase,\nmagnetized models of rotating protostellar collapse are favored by our\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 08:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

The electron\ntemperature and the photon index were slightly decreased and increased with\nincreasing flux, respectively. The source showed significant X-ray flux\nvariation on timescales of seconds. This short-term variation was found to be\nassociated with changes in the spectral shape, and the photon index became\nslightly harder at higher fluxes. This suggests that the variation was produced\nby a change in the properties of the hot electron cloud responsible for the\nstrong Comptonization.

In many cases, these\nfailures can be largely ameliorated by permitting the mean-field reference to\nbreak physical symmetries. Symmetry-broken coupled cluster, e.g. Bogoliubov\ncoupled cluster, theory can indeed provide reasonably accurate energetic\npredictions, but the broken symmetry can compromise the quality of the\nresulting wave function and predictions of observables other than the energy.\n  Merging symmetry projection and coupled cluster theory is therefore an\nappealing way to describe strongly correlated systems. Independently, two\ndifferent but related formalisms have been recently proposed to achieve this\ngoal. The two formalisms are contrasted in this manuscript, with results tested\non the Richardson pairing Hamiltonian. Both formalisms are based on the\ndisentangled cluster representation of the symmetry-rotated coupled cluster\nwavefunction. However, they differ in the way that the disentangled clusters\nare solved. One approach sets up angle-dependent coupled cluster equations,\nwhile the other involves first-order ordinary differential equations. The\nlatter approach yields energies and occupation probabilities significantly\nbetter than those of number-projected BCS and BCS coupled cluster and, when the\ndisentangled clusters are truncated at low excitation levels, has a\ncomputational cost not too much larger than that of BCS coupled cluster.\n  The high quality of results presented in this manuscript indicates that\nsymmetry-projected coupled cluster is a promising method that can accurately\ndescribe both weakly and strongly correlated finite many-fermion systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 10:17:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

This study proposes a novel variable\ndamping module design enabling energy regeneration in VIAs by exploiting the\nregenerative braking effect of DC motors. The proposed damping module uses four\nswitches to combine regenerative and dynamic braking, in a hybrid approach that\nenables energy regeneration without a reduction in the range of damping\nachievable. A physical implementation on a simple VIA mechanism is presented in\nwhich the regenerative properties of the proposed module are characterised and\ncompared against theoretical predictions. To investigate the role of variable\nregenerative damping in terms of energy efficiency of longterm operation,\nexperiments are reported in which the VIA equipped with the proposed damping\nmodule performs sequential reaching to a series of stochastic targets. The\nresults indicate that the combination of variable stiffness and variable\nregenerative damping is preferable to achieve the optimal trade-off between\ntask performance and energy efficiency.

To emphasize the\nsignature of the activity cycle we account for rotation-induced scatter in both\ndata sets by fitting a quasi-periodic Gaussian process model to each observing\nseason. After subtracting the rotational variability, cycle amplitudes and the\nphase difference between the two time series are obtained by fitting both time\nseries simultaneously using the same cycle period. We find cycle periods in 27\nof the 30 stars in our sample. The phase difference between the two time series\nreveals that the variability in fast rotating active stars is usually in\nanti-phase, while the variability of slowly rotating inactive stars is in\nphase. The photometric cycle amplitudes are on average six times larger for the\nactive stars. The phase and amplitude information demonstrates that active\nstars are dominated by dark spots, whereas less active stars are dominated by\nbright faculae. We find the transition from spot to faculae domination at the\nVaughan-Preston gap, and around a Rossby number equal to one.

Spin-to-charge conversion in ferromagnetic tunnel\ncontacts is well-described using linear (spin-)transport equations, provided\nthat there is no applied bias, as in nonlocal spin detection. It is shown here\nthat in a biased ferromagnetic tunnel contact, spin detection is strongly\nnonlinear. As a result, the spin-detection efficiency is not equal to the\ntunnel spin polarization. In silicon-based 4-terminal spin-transport devices,\neven a small bias (tens of mV) across the Fe/MgO detector contact enhances the\nspin-detection efficiency to values up to 140 \\% (spin extraction bias) or, for\nspin injection bias, reduces it to almost zero, while, parenthetically, the\ncharge current remains highly spin polarized.

An expression for the PI condition is\nderived in terms of a few microscopic parameters in each angular momentum\nchannel corresponding to a central interaction between the helical electrons.\nIt is found that because of the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nthe Landau parameter, $\\bar{F}_{l}$ corresponding to a particular angular\nmomentum channel $l$ depends not only on the electron-electron interaction in\nthe same channel but also interactions in $(l+1)$ and $(l-1)$ channels. The\nformalism automatically excludes the $l=1$ PI in the HFL where the Galilean\ninvariance is broken because of the presence of strong SOC. It is also found\nthat the competing PIs can only be avoided until the appearance of $l=2$ PI. In\nthis case, the corresponding nematic instability can even be achieved in the\n$l=1$ angular momentum channel of interaction between the electrons. The range\nof interaction between the electrons plays a pivotal role in bringing out the\nPIs. This is established by analysing a few realistic profiles of the\ninteraction. Another class of instability, involving a change in the topology\nof the Fermi surface without breaking the rotational symmetry, is found which\ncompetes with the PIs.

Many existing works discuss either heuristics or exact algorithms,\nresulting in a choice between quick runtimes and quality guarantees for the\nsolutions. Recently, the first fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) approximation\nalgorithm for the VNEP with arbitrary request and substrate topologies has been\npublished by Rost and Schmid. This algorithm is based on a LP formulation and\nis FPT in the newly introduced graph parameter extraction width (EW). It\ntherefore combines positive traits of heuristics and exact approaches: The\nruntime is polynomial for instances with bounded EW, and the algorithm returns\napproximate solutions with high probability.\n  We propose two extensions of this algorithm to optimize its runtime. Firstly,\nwe develop a new LP formulation related to tree decompositions. We show that\nthis LP formulation is always smaller, and that the resulting algorithm is FPT\nin the new parameter extraction label width (ELW). We improve on two important\nresults by Rost and Schmid: For centrally rooted half-wheel topologies, the EW\nscales linearly with request size, whereas the ELW is constant. Further, adding\nany number of paths parallel to an existing edge increases the EW by at most\nthe maximum degree of the request. By contrast, the ELW only increases by at\nmost one. Lastly, we show that finding the minimal ELW is NP-hard.\n  Secondly, we consider the approach of partitioning the request into subgraphs\nwhich are processed independently, yielding even smaller LP formulations. While\nthis algorithm may lead to higher ELW within the subgraphs, we show that this\nincrease is always smaller than the size of the inter-subgraph boundary. In\nparticular, the algorithm has zero additional cost when subgraphs are separated\nby a single node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 11:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

Many image textures, especially the small-scale or\nstochastic textures are rich in high-frequency variations, and are difficult to\nbe preserved. Current state-of-the-art denoising algorithms typically adopt a\nnonlocal approach consisting of image patch grouping and group-wise denoising\nfiltering. To achieve a better image denoising while preserving the variations\nin texture, we first adaptively group high correlated image patches with the\nsame kinds of texture elements (texels) via an adaptive clustering method. This\nadaptive clustering method is applied in an\nover-clustering-and-iterative-merging approach, where its noise robustness is\nimproved with a custom merging threshold relating to the noise level and\ncluster size. For texture-preserving denoising of each cluster, considering\nthat the variations in texture are captured and wrapped in not only the\nbetween-dimension energy variations but also the within-dimension variations of\nPCA transform coefficients, we further propose a PCA-transform-domain variation\nadaptive filtering method to preserve the local variations in textures.\nExperiments on natural images show the superiority of the proposed\ntransform-domain variation adaptive filtering to traditional PCA-based hard or\nsoft threshold filtering. As a whole, the proposed denoising method achieves a\nfavorable texture preserving performance both quantitatively and visually,\nespecially for stochastic textures, which is further verified in camera raw\nimage denoising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 11:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The system involves scheduling executions of contract algorithms\n(which offer a trade-off between allowable computation time and quality of the\nsolution) in m identical parallel processors. When an interruption occurs, the\nsystem must report a solution to each of the $n$ problem instances. The quality\nof this output is then compared to the best-possible algorithm that has\nforeknowledge of the interruption time and must, likewise, produce solutions to\nall $n$ problem instances. This extends the well-studied setting in which only\none problem instance is queried at interruption time.\n  In this work we first introduce new measures for evaluating the performance\nof interruptible systems in this setting. In particular, we propose the\ndeficiency of a schedule as a performance measure that meets the requirements\nof the problem at hand. We then present a schedule whose performance we prove\nthat is within a small factor from optimal in the general, multiprocessor\nsetting. We also show several lower bounds on the deficiency of schedules on a\nsingle processor. More precisely, we prove a general lower bound of (n+1)/n, an\nimproved lower bound for the two-problem setting (n=2), and a tight lower bound\nfor the class of round-robin schedules.

Users specify how that summary is computed, usually as an associative\nbinary operator because this is the most general known form for which it is\npossible to avoid naively scanning every window. For strictly in-order\narrivals, there are algorithms with $O(1)$ time per window change assuming\nassociative operators. Meanwhile, it is common in practice for streams to have\ndata arriving slightly out of order, for instance, due to clock drifts or\ncommunication delays. Unfortunately, for out-of-order streams, one has to\nresort to latency-prone buffering or pay $O(\\log n)$ time per insert or evict,\nwhere $n$ is the window size.\n  This paper presents the design, analysis, and implementation of FiBA, a novel\nsliding-window aggregation algorithm with an amortized upper bound of $O(\\log\nd)$ time per insert or evict, where $d$ is the distance of the inserted or\nevicted value to the closer end of the window. This means $O(1)$ time for\nin-order arrivals and nearly $O(1)$ time for slightly out-of-order arrivals,\nwith a smooth transition towards $O(\\log n)$ as $d$ approaches $n$. We also\nprove a matching lower bound on running time, showing optimality. Our algorithm\nis as general as the prior state-of-the-art: it requires associativity, but not\ninvertibility nor commutativity. At the heart of the algorithm is a careful\ncombination of finger-searching techniques, lazy rebalancing, and\nposition-aware partial aggregates. We further show how to answer range queries\nthat aggregate subwindows for window sharing. Finally, our experimental\nevaluation shows that FiBA performs well in practice and supports the\ntheoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 13:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-29"}

Resolution of the system is via minimization of a\nleast-squares functional representing the magnitude of the residual of the\nequations. A simple and immediate approach to extend this solver to\ndata-assimilation is to add a data-discrepancy term to the functional. Whereas\nmost data-assimilation techniques require a large number of evaluations of the\nforward-simulations and are therefore very expensive, the approach proposed in\nthis work uniquely has the same cost as a single forward run.

This makes a curious connection between cosmological\nand atomic scales. Using these coincidences, we can relate the Hubble constant,\nthe electron mass and the electron charge to the cosmological constant.

Such matrices have interesting sign variation diminishing properties, and\nit has been recently shown that they play an important role in the analysis of\ncertain nonlinear cooperative dynamical systems.\n  In this paper, the spectral properties of nonsingular matrices that are\n$SSR_k$ for a specific value $k$ are studied.

In this case,\nthe optimal beamformer is obtained by computing the sample matrix inverse and\nan optimal estimate of the signal of interest steering vector. The common\ncriteria to find the best estimate of the steering vector are the beamformer\noutput SINR and output power, while the constraints assume as little as\npossible prior inaccurate knowledge about the signal of interest, the\npropagation media, and the antenna array. Herein, a new beamformer output power\nmaximization problem is formulated and solved subject to a double-sided norm\nperturbation constraint, a similarity constraint, and a quadratic constraint\nthat guarantees that the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the signal of interest\nis away from the DOA region of all linear combinations of the interference\nsteering vectors. In the new robust design, the prior information required\nconsists of some allowable error norm bounds, the approximate knowledge of the\nantenna array geometry, and the angular sector of the signal of interest. It\nturns out that the array output power maximization problem is a non-convex QCQP\nproblem with inhomogeneous constraints. However, we show that the problem is\nstill solvable, and develop efficient algorithms for finding globally optimal\nestimate of the signal of interest steering vector. The results are generalized\nto the case where an ellipsoidal constraint is considered, and sufficient\nconditions for the global optimality are derived. In addition, a new quadratic\nconstraint on the actual signal steering vector is proposed in order to improve\nthe array performance. To validate our results, simulation examples are\npresented, and they demonstrate the improved performance of the new robust\nbeamformers in terms of the output SINR as well as the output power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 15:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The instrumental key feature is an increase of the dimensionality of\nthe recording scheme from 2D to 3D. A high-energy momentum microscope can\ndetect electrons with initial kinetic energies more than 6 keV with high\nangular resolution < 0.1{\\deg}. The large k-space acceptance of the special\nobjective lens allows for simultaneous full-field imaging of many Brillouin\nzones. Combined with time-of-flight parallel energy recording, this method\nyields maximum parallelization of data acquisition. In a pilot experiment at\nthe new beamline P22 at PETRA III, Hamburg, count rates of more than $10^{6}$\ncounts per second in the d-band complex of transition metals established an\nunprecedented HAXPES recording speed. It was found that the concept of\ntomographic k-space mapping previously demonstrated in the soft X-ray regime\nworks equally well in the hard X-ray range. Sharp valence band k-patterns of Re\ncollected at an excitation energy of 6 keV correspond to direct transitions to\nthe 28th repeated Brillouin zone. Given the high X-ray brilliance\n(1.1x$10^{13}$ hv/s in a spot of less than 20x15 $mu^{2}$), the 3D bulk\nBrillouin zone can be mapped in a few hours.

An\nimportant drawback of knockoffs is its instability: running the procedure twice\ncan result in very different selected features, potentially leading to\ndifferent conclusions. Addressing this instability is critical for obtaining\nreproducible and robust results. Here we present a generalization of the\nknockoff procedure that we call simultaneous multi-knockoffs. We show that\nmulti-knockoff guarantees false discovery rate (FDR) control, and is\nsubstantially more stable and powerful compared to the standard (single)\nknockoff. Moreover we propose a new algorithm based on entropy maximization for\ngenerating Gaussian multi-knockoffs. We validate the improved stability and\npower of multi-knockoffs in systematic experiments.

The\nmost common question which is generally asked is: How does an airplane gain\nlift? And the most common answer is via the Bernoulli principle. It turns out\nthat it is wrongly applied in common explanations, and there are certain\nmisconceptions. In an alternative explanation the push of air from below the\nwing is argued to be the lift generating force via Newton's law. There are\nproblems with this explanation too. In this paper we try to clear these\nmisconceptions, and the correct explanation, using the Lancaster-Prandtl\ncirculation theory, is discussed. We argue that even the Lancaster-Prandtl\ntheory at the zero angle of attack needs further insights. To this end, we put\nforward a theory which is applicable at zero angle of attack. A new length\nscale perpendicular to the lower surface of the wing is introduced and it turns\nout that the ratio of this length scale to the cord length of a wing is roughly\n$0.4930\\pm0.09498$ for typical NACA airfoils that we analyzed. This invariance\npoints to something fundamental. The idea of our theory is simple. The\n\"squeezing\" effect of the flow above the wing due to camber leads to an\neffective Venturi tube formation and leads to higher velocity over the upper\nsurface of the wing and thereby reducing pressure according the Bernoulli\ntheorem and generating lift. Thus at zero angle of attack there is no need to\ninvoke vortex and anti-vortex pair generation. In fact vortex and anti-vortex\npair generation cannot be justified. We come up with the equation for the lift\ncoefficient at zero angle of attack: \\[C_l = \\frac{1}{c}\\int_0^c dx\n\\left(\\frac{h_c^2}{(h_c - f(x))^2}-1\\right).\\] Here $C_l$ is the lift\ncoefficient, $h_c$ is our new length scale perpendicular to the lower surface\nof the wing and $f(x)$ is the functional profile of the upper surface of the\nwing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 10:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Therefore, generating\nfine-scaled population distributions from coarse population data is of great\nsignificance. However, there are three major challenges: 1) the complexity in\nspatial relations between high and low resolution population; 2) the dependence\nof population distributions on other external information; 3) the difficulty in\nretrieving temporal distribution patterns. In this paper, we first propose the\nidea to generate dynamic population distributions in full-time series, then we\ndesign dynamic population mapping via deep neural network(DeepDPM), a model\nthat describes both spatial and temporal patterns using coarse data and point\nof interest information. In DeepDPM, we utilize super-resolution convolutional\nneural network(SRCNN) based model to directly map coarse data into higher\nresolution data, and a time-embedded long short-term memory model to\neffectively capture the periodicity nature to smooth the finer-scaled results\nfrom the previous static SRCNN model.

The experiments have been\ncarried out in ambient air using a 100/140 multimode silica ber with a shaped\ntip along with a 35 kHz pulsed laser emitting 100 ns pulses at 1064 nm. This\nstudy shows that the phenomenon occurs only at low energies, just under the\nablation threshold. Bulk material appears to have moved around to achieve the\npeaks in a selforganized process. We hypothesize that the matter was melted and\nnot vaporized; hydrodynamic ow of molten material governed by surfacetension\nforces may be the causes. This surface modication has many applications. For\nexample, this paper reports on the decrease of wettability of a textured\nsilicon wafer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 06:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

To resolve those issues, we employ\nmachine-learning techniques to solve the full-waveform inversion.

The asymptotic expansion of the micro-displacement field in\nthe transformed Laplace domain allows obtaining, from the expression of the\nmicro-scale field equations, a set of recursive differential problems defined\nover the periodic unit cell. Consequently, the cell problems are derived in\nterms of perturbation functions depending on the geometrical and\nphysical-mechanical properties of the material and its microstructural\nheterogeneities. A down-scaling relation is formulated in a consistent form,\nwhich correlates the microscopic to the macroscopic transformed displacement\nfield and its gradients through the perturbation functions. Average field\nequations of infinite order are determined by substituting the down-scale\nrelation into the micro-field equation. Based on a variational approach, the\nmacroscopic field equations of a non-local continuum is delivered and the local\nand non-local overall constitutive and inertial tensors of the homogenized\ncontinuum are determined. The problem of wave propagation in case of a bi-phase\nlayered material with orthotropic phases and axis of orthotropy parallel to the\ndirection of layers is investigated as an example.
