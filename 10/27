Inspired by recent work on lattice-theoretic\nprogress measures, we develop a game-theoretical approach to the solution of\nsystems of monotone equations over lattices, where for each single equation\neither the least or greatest solution is taken. A simple parity game, referred\nto as fixpoint game, is defined that provides a correct and complete\ncharacterisation of the solution of equation systems over continuous lattices,\na quite general class of lattices widely used in semantics. For powerset\nlattices the fixpoint game is intimately connected with classical parity games\nfor $\\mu$-calculus model-checking, whose solution can exploit as a key tool\nJurdzi\\'nski's small progress measures. We show how the notion of progress\nmeasure can be naturally generalised to fixpoint games over continuous lattices\nand we prove the existence of small progress measures. Our results lead to a\nconstructive formulation of progress measures as (least) fixpoints. We refine\nthis characterisation by introducing the notion of selection that allows one to\nconstrain the plays in the parity game, enabling an effective (and possibly\nefficient) solution of the game, and thus of the associated verification\nproblem. We also propose a logic for specifying the moves of the existential\nplayer that can be used to systematically derive simplified equations for\nefficiently computing progress measures. We discuss potential applications to\nthe model-checking of latticed $\\mu$-calculi and to the solution of fixpoint\nequations systems over the reals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 16:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 11:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Chief among these techniques are backpressure (BP) control algorithms,\nwhich were originally developed of for large wireless networks. In addition to\nbeing light-weight computationally, they come with guarantees of performance at\nthe network level, specifically network-wide stability. The dynamics in\nbackpressure control are represented using networks of point queues and this\nalso applies to all of the applications to traffic control. As such, BP in\ntraffic fail to capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along the\nintersection links and, consequently, spill-back dynamics. This paper derives a\nposition weighted backpressure (PWBP) control policy for network traffic\napplying continuum modeling principles of traffic dynamics and thus capture the\nspatial distribution of vehicles along network roads and spill-back dynamics.\nPWBP inherits the computational advantages of traditional BP. To prove\nstability of PWBP, (i) a Lyapunov functional that captures the spatial\ndistribution of vehicles is developed; (ii) the capacity region of the network\nis formally defined in the context of macroscopic network traffic; and (iii) it\nis proved, when exogenous arrival rates are within the capacity region, that\nPWBP control is network stabilizing. We conduct comparisons against a\nreal-world adaptive control implementation for an isolated intersection.\nComparisons are also performed against other BP approaches in addition to\noptimized fixed timing control at the network level.

In biological applications,\nthe natural model for these dense substructures is often a complete bipartite\ngraph (biclique), and the problem requires enumerating all maximal bicliques\n(instead of just identifying the largest or densest). The best known algorithm\nin general graphs is due to Dias et al., and runs in time O(M |V|^4 ), where M\nis the number of maximal induced bicliques (MIBs) in the graph. When the graph\nbeing searched is itself bipartite, Zhang et al. give a faster algorithm where\nthe time per MIB depends on the number of edges in the graph. In this work, we\npresent a new algorithm for enumerating MIBs in general graphs, whose run time\ndepends on how \"close to bipartite\" the input is. Specifically, the runtime is\nparameterized by the size k of an odd cycle transversal (OCT), a vertex set\nwhose deletion results in a bipartite graph. Our algorithm runs in time O(M\n|V||E|k^2 3^(k/3) ), which is an improvement on Dias et al. whenever k <=\n3log_3(|V|). We implement our algorithm alongside a variant of Dias et al.'s in\nopen-source C++ code, and experimentally verify that the OCT-based approach is\nfaster in practice on graphs with a wide variety of sizes, densities, and OCT\ndecompositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 17:08:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 19:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

In the present work we develop\nand implement a non-linear optical photoswitching capability, Stimulated\nDepletion Quenching (SDQ), is used to overcome spectral cross-talk by\nexploiting the molecules' unique dynamic response to ultrashort laser pulses.\nSDQ is employed to enhance the control of Cph8, a photo-reversible phytochrome\nbased optogenetic switch designed to control gene expression in E.

A station has to be switched on in order to receive a\npacket when it is heard on the channel. Each station manages when it is\nswitched on and off by way of a programmable wakeup mechanism, which is\nscheduled by a routing algorithm. Packet injection is governed by adversarial\nmodels that determine upper bounds on injection rates and burstiness. We\ndevelop deterministic distributed routing algorithms and assess their\nperformance in the worst-case sense. One of the algorithms maintains bounded\nqueues for the maximum injection rate 1 subject only to the energy cap 3.

The rapid identification of signals is important in order to\ninitiate timely follow-up observations of transient emission that is only\ndetectable for short time periods. Joint searches for gravitational waves and\nhigh-energy neutrinos represent a prime motivation for this strategy. Both\ngravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos are typically emitted over a\nshort time frame of seconds to minutes during the formation or evolution of\ncompact objects. In addition, detectors searching for both messengers observe\nthe whole sky continuously, making observational information on potential\ntransient sources rapidly available to guide follow-up electromagnetic surveys.\nThe direction of high-energy neutrinos can be reconstructed to sub-degree\nprecision, making a joint detection much better localized than a typical\ngravitational wave signal. Here we present a search strategy for joint\ngravitational wave and high-energy neutrino events that allows the\nincorporation of astrophysical priors and detector characteristics following a\nBayesian approach.

Traditional algorithms\noperate on each problem instance independently, and good methods for\ntransferring experience from policies of other instances of a domain to a new\ninstance do not exist. Recently, researchers have begun exploring the use of\ndeep reactive policies, trained via deep reinforcement learning (RL), for MDP\nplanning domains. One advantage of deep reactive policies is that they are more\namenable to transfer learning.\n  In this paper, we present the first domain-independent transfer algorithm for\nMDP planning domains expressed in an RDDL representation. Our architecture\nexploits the symbolic state configuration and transition function of the domain\n(available via RDDL) to learn a shared embedding space for states and\nstate-action pairs for all problem instances of a domain. We then learn an RL\nagent in the embedding space, making a near zero-shot transfer possible, i.e.,\nwithout much training on the new instance, and without using the domain\nsimulator at all. Experiments on three different benchmark domains underscore\nthe value of our transfer algorithm.

It is generally believed that these stars have\nthick H envelopes. However, from stellar evolution considerations, the\nexistence of LMWDs with thin H envelopes is also possible. We present a\nthorough asteroseismological analysis of ELMV stars based on a complete set of\nfully evolutionary models that represents low-mass He-core WD stars harboring a\nrange of H envelope thicknesses. Although there are currently nine ELMVs, here\nwe only focus on those that exhibit more than three periods and whose periods\ndo not show significant uncertainties. We considered g-mode adiabatic pulsation\nperiods for low-mass He-core WD models with $M_*$ in the range\n[0.1554-0.4352]$M_{\\odot}$, $T_{\\rm eff}$ in the range [6000-10000]K, and H\nenvelope thicknesses in the range -5.8<log($M_{\\rm H}/M_*$)<-1.7. We explore\nthe effects of employing different H-envelope thicknesses on the adiabatic\npulsation properties of low-mass He-core WD models, and perform\nperiod-to-period fits to ELMVs to search for a representative model. We found\nthat the mode-trapping effects of g modes depend sensitively on $M_{\\rm H}$,\nwith the trapping cycle and trapping amplitude larger for thinner H envelopes.\nAlso, the asymptotic period spacing is longer for thinner H envelopes. Finally,\nwe found asteroseismological models (when possible) characterized by canonical\n(thick) and by thin H envelope, with $T_{\\rm eff}$ and $M_*$ in agreement with\nthe spectroscopic determinations. The fact that we have found\nasteroseismological solutions with H envelopes thinner than canonical gives a\nclue of the possible scenario of formation of these stars. Indeed, in the light\nof our results, some of these stars could have been formed by binary evolution\nthrough unstable mass loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 18:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Shortening the required\ntime of a single run of a quantum algorithm is essential for reducing\nenvironment-induced errors and for the efficiency of the computation. We have\ninvestigated the ability of a variational version of adiabatic quantum\ncomputation (AQC) to generate an accurate state more efficiently compared to\nexisting adiabatic methods.

Targeting minimal communication between nodes not only enables\nthe use of emerging spiking neuromorphic platforms, but may additionally\nstreamline processing conventionally. Low-power and embedded neuromorphic\nprocessors potentially offer dramatic performance-per-Watt improvements over\ntraditional von Neumann processors, however programming these brain-inspired\nplatforms generally requires platform-specific expertise which limits their\napplicability. To date, the majority of artificial neural networks have not\noperated using discrete spike-like communication.\n  We present a method for training deep spiking neural networks using an\niterative modification of the backpropagation optimization algorithm. This\nmethod, which we call Whetstone, effectively and reliably configures a network\nfor a spiking hardware target with little, if any, loss in performance.\nWhetstone networks use single time step binary communication and do not require\na rate code or other spike-based coding scheme, thus producing networks\ncomparable in timing and size to conventional ANNs, albeit with binarized\ncommunication. We demonstrate Whetstone on a number of image classification\nnetworks, describing how the sharpening process interacts with different\ntraining optimizers and changes the distribution of activity within the\nnetwork. We further note that Whetstone is compatible with several\nnon-classification neural network applications, such as autoencoders and\nsemantic segmentation. Whetstone is widely extendable and currently implemented\nusing custom activation functions within the Keras wrapper to the popular\nTensorFlow machine learning framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 20:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

To guide the search process, we use stochastic\nregular expressions and information theory to estimate the amount of\ninformation propagated by a candidate lens, preferring lenses that propagate\nmore information, as well as user annotations marking parts of the source and\ntarget formats as either irrelevant or essential.\n  We describe an implementation of simple symmetric lenses and our synthesis\nprocedure as extensions to the Boomerang language.

In two dimensions, the band gaps close at a trivial DTP\nwith zero Berry phase, which occurs at the transition between the normal and\ntopological insulator phases. In three dimensions, the topological properties\nof three different DTP fermions in lattice systems are further investigated,\nand the effects of breaking $C_4$ symmetry are also studied, which generally\nleads to splitting each quadratic DTP into two linear triple points and gives\ntopological phase diagrams. Using ultracold fermionic atoms in optical\nlattices, the proposed models can be realized and the topological properties of\nthe DTP fermions can be detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 00:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

In this work we propose and study sensitivity indices\nfor the case where the output lies on a Riemannian manifold. These indices are\nbased on a Cram\\'er von Mises like criterion that takes into account the\ngeometry of the output support. We propose a Pick-Freeze like estimator of\nthese indices based on an $U$--statistic. The asymptotic properties of these\nestimators are studied. Further, we provide and discuss some interesting\nnumerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 03:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

In contrast\nto what is known from biology, these networks largely rely on feedforward\nconnections, ignoring the influence of recurrent connections. They also focus\non supervised rather than unsupervised learning. To address these issues, we\ncombine traditional supervised learning via backpropagation with a specialized\nunsupervised learning rule to learn lateral connections between neurons within\na convolutional neural network. These connections have been shown to optimally\nintegrate information from the surround, generating extra-classical receptive\nfields for the neurons in our new proposed model (CNNEx). Models with optimal\nlateral connections are more robust to noise and achieve better performance on\nnoisy versions of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Resistance to noise can be\nfurther improved by combining our model with additional regularization\ntechniques such as dropout and weight decay. Although the image statistics of\nMNIST and CIFAR-10 differ greatly, the same unsupervised learning rule\ngeneralized to both datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential usefulness\nof combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and suggest that\nthe integration of lateral connections into convolutional neural networks is an\nimportant area of future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 04:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Any groupcast index coding problem is\ndescribed by its \\emph{fitting matrix} which contains unknown entries along\nwith $1$'s and $0$'s. The problem of finding an optimal scalar linear code is\nequivalent to completing this matrix with known entries such that the rank of\nthe resulting matrix is minimized. Any row basis of such a completion gives an\noptimal \\emph{scalar linear} code. An index coding problem is said to be a\njoint extension of a finite number of index coding problems, if the fitting\nmatrices of these problems are disjoint submatrices of the fitting matrix of\nthe jointly extended problem. In this paper, a class of joint extensions of any\nfinite number of groupcast index coding problems is identified, where the\nrelation between the fitting matrices of the sub-problems present in the\nfitting matrix of the jointly extended problem is defined by a base problem.

The\nsignal produced during photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) measurement is,\nhowever, usually weak and needs to be amplified. This is achieved by using a\nphotoacoustic cell resonator where acoustic resonances are utilized to\nsignificantly boost the signal. Therefore, a PA resonator has a significant\nrole in PAS measurement set-ups. When designing or optimizing a new PA\nresonator, numerical methods are generally used to simulate the photoacoustic\nsignal generation. In this paper, the amplitude mode expansion (AME) method is\npresented as a quick and accurate simulation tool. The method is used to\nsimulate the photoacoustic signal in a multi-scale T-cell resonator over a wide\nfrequency range. The AME method is based on eigenmode expansion and\nintroduction of losses by quality factors. The AME simulation results are\ncompared and analyzed against the results from the viscothermal method.\nReasonably good agreement is obtained between the two methods.

This modality relies on constructing, for each\npixel, a histogram of time delays between emitted light pulses and detected\nphoton arrivals. In a general setting, more than one surface can be observed in\na single pixel. The problem of estimating the number of surfaces, their\nreflectivity and position becomes very challenging in the low-photon regime\n(which equates to short acquisition times) or relatively high background levels\n(i.e., strong ambient illumination). This paper presents a new approach to 3D\nreconstruction using single-photon, single-wavelength Lidar data, which is\ncapable of identifying multiple surfaces in each pixel.

In this sense, the\nsurface tension selects a single physically meaningful solution from the\ncontinuum of zero-surface-tension solutions. Recently, we provided numerical\nevidence to suggest the selection problem for a bubble propagating in an\nunbounded Hele-Shaw cell behaves in an analogous way to other finger and bubble\nproblems in a Hele-Shaw channel; however, the selection of the ratio of bubble\nspeeds to background velocity appears to follow a very different surface\ntension scaling to the channel cases.

While walking like a molecular motor along a DNA track in a\nstep-by-step manner, a RNAP simultaneously synthesizes a RNA chain; in each\nforward step it elongates the nascent RNA molecule by one unit, using the DNA\ntrack also as the template.

Doctors use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to\ndetect and locate tumors in the brain, and very carefully analyze scans to\nsegment brain tumors. Manual segmentation is time consuming and tiring for\ndoctors, and it can be difficult for them to notice extremely small\nabnormalities. Automated segmentations performed by computers offer quicker\ndiagnoses, the ability to notice small details, and more accurate\nsegmentations. Advances in deep learning and computer hardware have allowed for\nhigh-performing automated segmentation approaches.

In this paper, I propose applying V-Net, a volumetric, fully\nconvolutional neural network, to segment brain tumors in MRI scans from the\nBraTS Challenges.

Nonlinear\nactivation functions, like Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), Exponential Linear\nUnits (ELU) and Scaled Exponential Linear Units (SELU), outperform the linear\ncounterparts. However, selecting an appropriate activation function is a\nchallenging problem, as it affects the accuracy and the complexity of the given\nDNN. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to automatically select the\nbest-possible activation function for each layer of a given DNN, such that the\noverall DNN accuracy, compared to considering only one type of activation\nfunction for the whole DNN, is improved. However, an associated scientific\nchallenge in exploring all the different configurations of activation functions\nwould be time and resource-consuming. Towards this, our methodology identifies\nthe Evaluation Points during learning to evaluate the accuracy in an\nintermediate step of training and to perform early termination by checking the\naccuracy gradient of the learning curve. This helps in significantly reducing\nthe exploration time during training. Moreover, our methodology selects, for\neach layer, the dropout rate that optimizes the accuracy.

In this regard, this paper investigates\nthe connectivity of underwater optical wireless sensor networks (UOWSNs) and\nits impacts on the network localization performance. Firstly, we model UOWSNs\nas randomly scaled sector graphs where the connection between sensors is\nestablished by point-to-point directed links.

Additionally, they support topologically protected spin-1 edge\nstates, which are fundamentally different than spin-1/2 and pseudo-spin-1/2\nedge states arising in fermionic and pseudo-fermionic systems. The striking\nfeature of the edge state is that all electric and magnetic field components\nvanish at the boundary.

To accomplish this, we put forth the concept of microscopic (nonlocal)\nphotonic band structure of solids, analogous to the traditional theory of\nelectronic band structure.
