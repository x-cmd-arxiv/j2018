The new legislation aims to diversify the country's\ngeneration matrix, mainly composed of hydro and fuel-based generation, with a\nshare of 66% and 34% respectively. Currently, three wind generation projects,\nwith an aggregated capacity of 500 MW, have been commissioned in the North of\nthe country. This study analyses the economic impact of the large-scale\nintroduction of wind generation on both, the market spot price and conventional\ngeneration plants operation. For this purpose, the study builds a unit\ncommitment model to mimic the current market legislation and the system's\ngeneration data. We show that the introduction of wind energy into the\nColombian electricity market would impact the generation share of large hydro\nand gas-fired power plants. The hydro generation has an important role in\nbalancing the generation for fluctuations on the wind resource. Meanwhile, the\ngas-fired plants would decrease their participation in the market,\nproportionally to the introduction of wind generation in the system, by as low\nas 20% of its current operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 12:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

The obtained results are summarized as follows.\nAccording to the limit property, the ACR is classified into two categories: (1)\nlinear ACR whose limit inferior value is larger than a positive and (2)\nsublinear ACR whose value converges to zero. Then, it is proven that the ACR is\nlinear for evolutionary programming using positive landscape-adaptive mutation,\nbut sublinear for that using landscape-invariant or zero landscape-adaptive\nmutation.

Beyond\nmonitoring the AB X-ray luminosities, the HRC-I sequence represents a unique\ndecadal record of the dozen, or so, serendipitous X-ray sources in the Alpha\nCen field, which is at low Galactic latitude and thus dominated by nearby\nstars.

All ten X-ray sources\nhave Gaia objects within about 2 arcseconds; mostly late-type dwarfs, but a few\ngiants. However, two of the proposed optical counterparts have statistically\nsignificant offsets, and possible conflicts between the X-ray and optical\nproperties. Another of the candidates brightened a factor of 100 in X-rays\nduring a single exposure, briefly attaining super-flare status. The Gaia\ncounterpart is anomalously blue for its absolute G-magnitude, and likely is a\nWD+dM pair.

Perceptual\naliasing is the phenomenon where different places generate a similar visual\n(or, in general, perceptual) footprint. This causes spurious measurements to be\nfed to the SLAM estimator, which typically results in incorrect localization\nand mapping results. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that those outliers\nare highly correlated, in the sense that perceptual aliasing creates a large\nnumber of mutually-consistent outliers. Another issue stems from the fact that\nmost state-of-the-art techniques rely on a given trajectory guess (e.g., from\nodometry) to discern between inliers and outliers and this makes the resulting\npipeline brittle, since the accumulation of error may result in incorrect\nchoices and recovery from failures is far from trivial.

Then, based on the fast, parallel DNN-based hull-form evaluation,\nthe large-scale search for optimal hull forms is performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 20:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

These systems\noften suffer from various interferences caused by multiple-users moving\nsimultaneously, resulting in extremely low recognition accuracy. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose a novel system, called Motion-Fi, which marries battery\nfree wireless backscattering and device-free sensing. Motion-Fi is an accurate,\ninterference tolerable motion-recognition system, which counts repetitive\nmotions without using scenario-dependent templates or profiles and enables\nmulti-users performing certain motions simultaneously because of the relatively\nshort transmission range of backscattered signals. Although the repetitive\nmotions are fairly well detectable through the backscattering signals in\ntheory, in reality they get blended into various other system noises during the\nmotion. Moreover, irregular motion patterns among users will lead to expensive\ncomputation cost for motion recognition. We build a backscattering wireless\nplatform to validate our design in various scenarios for over 6 months when\ndifferent persons, distances and orientations are incorporated. In our\nexperiments, the periodicity in motions could be recognized without any\nlearning or training process, and the accuracy of counting such motions can be\nachieved within 5% count error. With little efforts in learning the patterns,\nour method could achieve 93.1% motion-recognition accuracy for a variety of\nmotions. Moreover, by leveraging the periodicity of motions, the recognition\naccuracy could be further improved to nearly 100% with only 3 repetitions. Our\nexperiments also show that the motions of multiple persons separating by around\n2 meters cause little accuracy reduction in the counting process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 20:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

When ribbons\nsweep through regions that undergo a rotational motion, the fields transiently\nturn more vertical with decreased horizontal field and inclination angle, and\nthen restore and/or become more horizontal than before the ribbon arrival.

In this paper, we speculate that a fundamental shortcoming of\nsequence generation models is that the decoding is done strictly from\nleft-to-right, meaning that outputs values generated earlier have a profound\neffect on those generated later. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nmiddle-out decoder architecture that begins from an initial middle-word and\nsimultaneously expands the sequence in both directions. To facilitate\ninformation flow and maintain consistent decoding, we introduce a dual\nself-attention mechanism that allows us to model complex dependencies between\nthe outputs.

However, in practice\nthe discriminator is constrained to be in a smaller class $\\mathcal{F}$ such as\nneural nets. Then, a natural question is how the divergence minimization\ninterpretation changes as we constrain $\\mathcal{F}$. In this work, we address\nthis question by developing a convex duality framework for analyzing GANs.

Furthermore, it is\nalso extremely challenging to parallelize MCTS due to its inherent sequential\nnature: each rollout heavily relies on the statistics (e.g., node visitation\ncounts) estimated from previous simulations to achieve an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. In spite of these difficulties, we develop\nan algorithm, WU-UCT, to effectively parallelize MCTS, which achieves linear\nspeedup and exhibits only limited performance loss with an increasing number of\nworkers. The key idea in WU-UCT is a set of statistics that we introduce to\ntrack the number of on-going yet incomplete simulation queries (named as\nunobserved samples). These statistics are used to modify the UCT tree policy in\nthe selection steps in a principled manner to retain effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff when we parallelize the most time-consuming\nexpansion and simulation steps. Experiments on a proprietary benchmark and the\nAtari Game benchmark demonstrate the linear speedup and the superior\nperformance of WU-UCT comparing to existing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 03:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 16:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 21:10:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 03:48:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 22:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

As a secondary\nuser (SU), a DSA device will face two critical problems: avoiding causing\nharmful interference to primary users (PUs), and conducting effective\ninterference coordination with other secondary users. These two problems become\neven more challenging for a distributed DSA network where there is no\ncentralized controllers for SUs. In this paper, we investigate communication\nstrategies of a distributive DSA network under the presence of spectrum sensing\nerrors. To be specific, we apply the powerful machine learning tool, deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL), for SUs to learn \"appropriate\" spectrum access\nstrategies in a distributed fashion assuming NO knowledge of the underlying\nsystem statistics. Furthermore, a special type of recurrent neural network\n(RNN), called the reservoir computing (RC), is utilized to realize DRL by\ntaking advantage of the underlying temporal correlation of the DSA network.\nUsing the introduced machine learning-based strategy, SUs could make spectrum\naccess decisions distributedly relying only on their own current and past\nspectrum sensing outcomes. Through extensive experiments, our results suggest\nthat the RC-based spectrum access strategy can help the SU to significantly\nreduce the chances of collision with PUs and other SUs.

The cool circumgalactic clouds are\ntransient due to evaporation and recycling and therefore a constant\nreplenishment is needed to maintain the cool CGM. We further model the ensemble\nproperties of the cool CGM with clouds originated from outflows, inflows,\nor/and in-situ formation with a range of initial cloud mass function and\nvelocity distribution. We find that only with a certain combination of\nparameters, an outflow model can broadly reproduce three cool gas properties\naround star-forming galaxies simultaneously: the spatial distribution,\ndown-the-barrel outflow absorption, and gas velocity dispersion. Both a\nconstant insitu model and gas inflow model can reproduce the observed covering\nfractions of high $\\rm N_{HI}$ gas around passive galaxies but they fail to\nreproduce sufficient number of low $\\rm N_{HI}$ systems. The limitations and\nthe failures of the current models are discussed. Our results illustrate that\nsemi-analytic modeling is a promising tool to understand the physics of the\ncool CGM which is usually unresolved by state-of-the-art cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 07:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 12:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Most MOT methods\nemploy two steps: Object Detection and Data Association. The first step detects\nobjects of interest in every frame of a video, and the second establishes\ncorrespondence between the detected objects in different frames to obtain their\ntracks. Object detection has made tremendous progress in the last few years due\nto deep learning. However, data association for tracking still relies on hand\ncrafted constraints such as appearance, motion, spatial proximity, grouping\netc. to compute affinities between the objects in different frames. In this\npaper, we harness the power of deep learning for data association in tracking\nby jointly modelling object appearances and their affinities between different\nframes in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed Deep Affinity Network (DAN)\nlearns compact; yet comprehensive features of pre-detected objects at several\nlevels of abstraction, and performs exhaustive pairing permutations of those\nfeatures in any two frames to infer object affinities. DAN also accounts for\nmultiple objects appearing and disappearing between video frames.

Many current methods adopt the \"localization by classification\"\nframework: first do video classification, then locate temporal area\ncontributing to the results most. However, this framework fails to locate the\nentire action instances and gives little consideration to the local context. In\nthis paper, we present a novel architecture called Cascaded Pyramid Mining\nNetwork (CPMN) to address these issues using two effective modules. First, to\ndiscover the entire temporal interval of specific action, we design a two-stage\ncascaded module with proposed Online Adversarial Erasing (OAE) mechanism, where\nnew and complementary regions are mined through feeding the erased feature maps\nof discovered regions back to the system. Second, to exploit hierarchical\ncontextual information in videos and reduce missing detections, we design a\npyramid module which produces a scale-invariant attention map through combining\nthe feature maps from different levels. Final, we aggregate the results of two\nmodules to perform action localization via locating high score areas in\ntemporal Class Activation Sequence (CAS).

A variational approach (3D-Var) is used to find the best\nestimate for the rain rate, and its error covariance, from the different rain\nsensors. Short-term rain rate forecasts are then produced by assuming\nLagrangian persistence. A velocity field is obtained from the operational\nradar-derived rain fields, and the rain rate field is advected using the Total\nVariance Diminishing (TVD) scheme. The error covariance associated to the\nestimated rain rate is also propagated, and we use these two in the 3D-Var at\nthe next observation time step. This approach can be seen as a Variational\nKalman Filter (VKF), in which the covariance of the prior is not constant but\ndependent on time.

Here, three\nencodings are compared: Sinz's sequential-counter, Bailleux and Boufkhad's\ntree-based, and Ab\\'{\\i}o and coworkers' sort-based approaches. The\nsequential-counter approach is found to be the fastest of these for a range of\nrelated, combinatorial test cases. All encodings permit multiple solutions in\nthe auxiliary variables for a single solution to the main variables; the\nnumbers of multiple solutions can be very large, and might impede a Sat solver.\nVariants of the encodings are developed, where extra clauses reduce the numbers\nof multiple solutions. These variants are found to have remarkably little\neffect on solution time, even when the number of clauses is approximately\ndoubled. The results accentuate the well-known observation that clause count\nand other measures of encoding size are not reliable indicators of the\ndifficulty of a Sat problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2018 16:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

The main novelties of the\nproposed fluid-structure interaction framework are 1) the use of elastodynamics\nequations for the structure, 2) the use of a high-order Navier-Stokes solver\nfor the flow, and 3) the variational transfer (L2-projection) for coupling the\nsolid and fluid subproblems. The dynamic behavior of a deformable structure is\nsimulated in a finite element framework by adopting a fully implicit scheme for\nits temporal integration. It allows for mechanical constitutive laws including\nnonhomogeneous and fiber-reinforced materials. The Navier-Stokes equations for\nthe incompressible flow are discretized with high-order finite differences\nwhich allow for the direct numerical simulation of laminar, transitional and\nturbulent flows. The structure and the flow solvers are coupled by using an\nL2-projection method for the transfer of velocities and forces between the\nfluid grid and the solid mesh. This strategy allows for the numerical solution\nof coupled large scale problems based on nonconforming structured and\nunstructured grids. The framework is validated with the Turek-Hron benchmark\nand a newly proposed benchmark modelling the flow-induced oscillation of an\ninert plate. A three-dimensional simulation of an elastic beam in transitional\nflow is provided to show the solver's capability of coping with anisotropic\nelastic structures immersed in complex fluid flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 11:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}
