Yet there exist\nsituations, such as in the power market, in which the volume to be traded can\nonly be estimated and becomes more accurate when approaching a specified\ndelivery time. During the course of execution, a trader should then constantly\nadapt their trading strategy to meet their fluctuating volume target. In this\npaper, we develop a model that accounts for volume uncertainty and we show that\na risk-averse trader has benefit in delaying their trades. More precisely, we\nargue that the optimal strategy is a trade-off between early and late trades in\norder to balance risk associated with both price and volume. By incorporating a\nrisk term related to the volume to trade, the static optimal strategies\nsuggested by our model avoid the explosion in the algorithmic complexity\nusually associated with dynamic programming solutions, all the while yielding\ncompetitive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 23:48:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 12:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 15:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 14:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 13:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The proposed\nmetasurface design exploits extreme phase gradients, implemented via locally\nresonant elements, in order to achieve operating conditions that are largely\nbeyond the critical angle. Such artificial discontinuity is capable of\nproducing complete reflection of the incoming waves regardless of the specific\nangle of incidence. From a practical perspective, the TIR-MS behaves as a sound\nhard barrier that is impenetrable to long-wavelength modes at a selected\nfrequency. The TIR metasurface concept is first conceived for a flat interface\nembedded in a rectangular waveguide and designed to block longitudinal S0-type\nguided modes. Then, it is extended to circular plates in order to show how\nenclosed areas can be effectively shielded by incoming waves. Given the same\nunderlying physics, an equivalent dynamic behavior was also numerically and\nexperimentally illustrated for flexural A0-type guided modes.

The approach is similar\nto that used in structural analysis, but the stiffness matrix of granular\nmaterial is inherently non-symmetric because of the geometrics of particle\ninteractions and of the frictional behavior of the contacts. Internal geometric\nconstraints are imposed by the particles' shapes, in particular, by the surface\ncurvatures of the particles at their points of contact. Moreover, the stiffness\nrelationship is incrementally non-linear, and even small assemblies require the\nanalysis of multiple stiffness branches, with each branch region being a\npointed convex cone in displacement-space. These aspects of the particle-level\nstiffness relationship gives rise to three types of micro-scale failure:\nneutral equilibrium, bifurcation and path instability, and instability of\nequilibrium. These three pathologies are defined in the context of four types\nof displacement constraints, which can be readily analyzed with certain\ngeneralized inverses.

However, web applications present multiple challenges that make\ntime-travel debugging especially difficult. A time-traveling debugger for web\napplications must accurately reproduce all network interactions, asynchronous\nevents, and visual states observed during the original execution, both while\nstepping forwards and backwards. This must all be done in the context of a\ncomplex and highly multithreaded browser runtime. At the same time, to be\npractical, a time-traveling debugger must maintain interactive speeds.\n  This paper presents McFly, the first time-traveling debugger for web\napplications.

This approach lets\nMcFly provide accurate time-travel debugging - maintaining JavaScript and\nvisual state in sync at all times - at interactive speeds.

Although the original distributed ledger technology (DLT) of\nblockchain is deemed secure and decentralized, the confirmation of transactions\nis inefficient by design. Recently adopted, directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based\ndistributed ledgers validate transactions efficiently without the physically\nand environmentally costly building process of blocks (Lerner (2015)). However,\ncentrally-controlled confirmation against the odds of multiple validation\ndisqualifies the DAG as a decentralized-distributed ledger. In this regard, we\nintroduce an innovative DLT by reconstructing a chain of antichains based on a\ngiven DAG-pool of transactions. Each antichain (box) contains distinct nodes\nwhose approved transactions are recursively validated by subsequently\naugmenting nodes. The boxer node closes the box and keeps the hash of all\ntransactions confirmed by the box-genesis node. Designation of boxers and\nbox-geneses is conditionally randomized for decentralization. The boxes are\nserially concatenated with recursive confirmation (boxchain) without incurring\nthe cost of box generation. Rewards (boxcoin) are paid to the contributing\nnodes of the ecosystem whose trust is built on the doubly-secure protocol of\nconfirmation.

Since, even when CLE\nsimulations converge, they are not guaranteed to produce correct results except\nunder very stringent conditions, which lattice QCD at finite $\\mu$ does not\nobey, we need extensive testing to determine under what conditions it produces\nreliable results. We performed simulations at $\\beta=6/g^2=5.6$ and\n$\\beta=5.7$, both at $m=0.025$. For small $\\mu$ and $\\mu$ large enough to\nproduce saturation, measured observables appear to be approaching their correct\nvalues as the coupling is decreased. However, for intermediate $\\mu$ values,\nthese simulations predict a transition from hadronic to nuclear matter at a\n$\\mu$ which is far too small. Since there is evidence that for CLE simulations\nto produce correct results the trajectories should remain close to the $SU(3)$\nmanifold (at least for small $\\mu$), we explore the parameter space to see\nwhere this is true. We find that the distance from this manifold decreases as\nthe coupling decreases and as the quark mass (in lattice units) decreases, i.e.\nas we approach the continuum limit. This indicates that we need to simulate at\nsmaller couplings and quark masses (requiring larger lattices) to see if these\ncan produce the correct physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 20:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

The resulting projected\nmeasure is then used for inference. The projected sample path has closed form\nwhich facilitates efficient computations. In particular, our projection\napproach maintains a comparable computational efficiency with that of the\noriginal GP. The proposed method yield predictions that respects bound\nconstraints everywhere, while allows varying bounds across the input domain.

We consider lattices with N sites and quasi-periodic boundary\nconditions associated to an arbitrary twist K having simple spectrum (but not\nnecessarily diagonalizable). In our approach the SoV basis is constructed in an\nuniversal manner starting from the direct use of the conserved charges of the\nmodels, i.e., from the commuting family of transfer matrices. Using the\nintegrable structure of the models, incarnated in the hierarchy of transfer\nmatrices fusion relations, we prove that our SoV basis indeed separates the\nspectrum of the corresponding transfer matrices. Moreover, the combined use of\nthe fusion rules, of the known analytic properties of the transfer matrices and\nof the SoV basis allows us to obtain the complete characterization of the\ntransfer matrix spectrum and to prove its simplicity. Any transfer matrix\neigenvalue is completely characterized as a solution of a so-called quantum\nspectral curve equation that we obtain as a difference functional equation of\norder n.

While there\nis a vast amount of cryptography-based data protection schemes, only few are\ndesigned for long-term protection. Recently, Braun et al. (AsiaCCS'17) proposed\nthe first long-term protection scheme that provides renewable integrity\nprotection and information-theoretic confidentiality protection. However,\ncomputation and storage costs of their scheme increase significantly with the\nnumber of stored data items. As a result, their scheme appears suitable only\nfor protecting databases with a small number of relatively large data items,\nbut unsuitable for databases that hold a large number of relatively small data\nitems (e.g., medical record databases). In this work, we present a solution for\nefficient long-term integrity and confidentiality protection of large datasets\nconsisting of relatively small data items. First, we construct a renewable\nvector commitment scheme that is information-theoretically hiding under\nselective decommitment. We then combine this scheme with renewable timestamps\nand information-theoretically secure secret sharing. The resulting solution\nrequires only a single timestamp for protecting a dataset while the state of\nthe art requires a number of timestamps linear in the number of data items. We\nimplemented our solution and measured its performance in a scenario where 12\n000 data items are aggregated, stored, protected, and verified over a time span\nof 100 years. Our measurements show that our new solution completes this\nevaluation scenario an order of magnitude faster than the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 21:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

The difficulty\nin building large databases of patients who have received specific treatments\nand the high dimensionality of medical image analysis problems are challenges\nin this work. We propose a generic and accurate two-level approach for\nhigh-dimensional regression problems in medical image analysis. First, we\nperform region-level feature selection using a predefined brain parcellation.\nBased on the assumption that voxels within one region in the brain have similar\nvalues, for each region we use the bootstrapped mean of voxels within it as a\nfeature. In this way, the dimension of data is reduced from number of voxels to\nnumber of regions. Then we detect predictive regions by various feature\nselection methods. Second, we extract voxels within selected regions, and\nperform voxel-level feature selection. To use this model in both linear and\nnon-linear cases with limited training examples, we apply two-level elastic net\nregression and random forest (RF) models respectively. To validate accuracy and\nrobustness of this approach, we perform experiments on both task-fMRI and\nresting state fMRI datasets.

The latter is relevant for the study of several small\nthermodynamic systems. We consider here a time-periodic Markov chain with\ncontinuous time and a broad class of functionals of stochastic trajectories,\nwhich are general linear combinations of the empirical flow and the empirical\ndensity.

Two different cases are considered for parameter uncertainty\npropagation and global sensitivity analysis.

Being a two\ndimensional stochastic problem, the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method is\nused as a surrogate model. Case B deals with non-uniform stochasticity in the\nboundary temperature. Instead of the traditional Gaussian process model with\nthe Karhunen-Lo$\\grave{e}$ve expansion, a novel approach is successfully\nimplemented to model uncertainty in the boundary condition. The boundary is\ndivided into multiple domains and the temperature imposed on each domain is\nassumed to be an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random\nvariable.

In fact, they may be aided by entities with\nlarge financial and human resources. Hence there is urgent need to develop\npredictive approaches for cyber defense to strengthen cloud infrastructures\nspecifically utilized by critical infrastructures. Extensive research has been\ndone in the past on applying techniques such as Game Theory, Machine Learning\nand Bayesian Networks among others for the predictive defense of critical\ninfrastructures. However a major drawback of these approaches is that they do\nnot incorporate probabilistic human behavior which limits their predictive\nability. In this paper, a stochastic approach is proposed to predict less\nsecure states in critical cloud systems which might lead to potential security\nbreaches. These less-secure states are deemed as `risky' states in our\napproach. Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to accurately incorporate user\nbehavior(s) as well as operational behavior of the cloud infrastructure through\na set of features. The developed reward/cost mechanism is then used to select\nappropriate `actions' to identify risky states at future time steps by learning\nan optimal policy.

Although faster non-AR\nmodels were recently reported, they may be prohibitively complicated due to the\nuse of a distilling training method and the blend of other disparate training\ncriteria. This study proposes a non-AR neural source-filter waveform model that\ncan be directly trained using spectrum-based training criteria and the\nstochastic gradient descent method. Given the input acoustic features, the\nproposed model first uses a source module to generate a sine-based excitation\nsignal and then uses a filter module to transform the excitation signal into\nthe output speech waveform. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed\nmodel generated waveforms at least 100 times faster than the AR WaveNet and the\nquality of its synthetic speech is close to that of speech generated by the AR\nWaveNet. Ablation test results showed that both the sine-wave excitation signal\nand the spectrum-based training criteria were essential to the performance of\nthe proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 04:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:16:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 07:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 02:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

This requires steganalysis experts to design effective and robust\ndetection algorithms to identify the guilty actor(s). The mainstream works use\nclustering, ensemble and anomaly detection, where distances in high dimensional\nspace between features of actors are determined to find out the outlier(s)\ncorresponding to steganographer(s).

In this work,\nwe employ direct numerical simulation by solving the Navier-Stokes equations\nand using volume of fluid method to track the liquid-liquid interface during\ndrainage in disordered porous media.

To\nthis end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented\nlinear mixing model (ALMM), to address spectral variability by applying a\ndata-driven learning strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing.\nThe proposed approach models the main spectral variability (i.e., scaling\nfactors) generated by variations in illumination or typography separately by\nmeans of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities\ncaused by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity,\natmospheric effects) and instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), as\nwell as material nonlinear mixing effects, by introducing a spectral\nvariability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning strategy,\nwe also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability\ndictionary, whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures\nof endmembers, which leads to a well-known low coherence dictionary learning\nproblem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique is embedded in the framework of\nspectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability\ndictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously.

In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are\npresent, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain\nshattering due to grain-grain collisions. The remaining question is whether\nthese nanoparticles can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how\nto constrain their size and abundance with observations. In this paper, we\npresent a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on\ncentrifugal stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic\natomic bombardment, which is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow. The resulting centrifugal stress within suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can exceed the maximum tensile strength of grain material\n($S_{\\max}$), resulting in rapid disruption of nanoparticles smaller than\n$a\\sim 1$ nm for $S_{\\max}\\sim 10^{9}\\erg\\cm^{-3}$. The proposed disruption\nmechanism is shown to be more efficient than thermal sputtering in controlling\nthe lower cutoff of grain size distribution in C-shocks. We model microwave\nemission from spinning nanoparticles in C-shocks subject to supersonic neutral\ndrift and rotational disruption. We find that suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can emit strong microwave radiation, and both peak flux and peak\nfrequency increase with increasing the shock velocity.

Within these\nconstraints, we find that the hydrodynamic properties of a 1-1 electrolyte\nsolution are similar to the behaviour predicted by the Fuoss-Onsager theory of\nelectrolyte dynamics, and we quantify the limitations of the theory for 2-1 and\n2-2 electrolytes.

As deep learning is particularly suited to deal with\nspatially organized data, we applied it to the detection of proteins with\nstructural repetitions. Results: We present DeepSymmetry, a versatile method\nbased on three-dimensional (3D) convolutional networks that detects structural\nrepetitions in proteins and their density maps. Our method is designed to\nidentify tandem repeat proteins, proteins with internal symmetries, symmetries\nin the raw density maps, their symmetry order, and also the corresponding\nsymmetry axes. Detection of symmetry axes is based on learning six-dimensional\nVeronese mappings of 3D vectors, and the median angular error of axis\ndetermination is less than one degree. We demonstrate the capabilities of our\nmethod on benchmarks with tandem repeated proteins and also with symmetrical\nassemblies. For example, we have discovered over 10,000 putative tandem repeat\nproteins that are not currently present in the RepeatsDB database.\nAvailability: The method is available at\nhttps://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/deepsymmetry.

To address the two limitations, in this paper\nwe propose a novel recommendation framework based on deep reinforcement\nlearning, called DRR. The DRR framework treats recommendation as a sequential\ndecision making procedure and adopts an \"Actor-Critic\" reinforcement learning\nscheme to model the interactions between the users and recommender systems,\nwhich can consider both the dynamic adaptation and long-term rewards.\nFurthermore, a state representation module is incorporated into DRR, which can\nexplicitly capture the interactions between items and users.

Aims: The mid-infrared colour\nselection technique has been proven to be an efficient means of identifying\nAGN, especially obscured sources. The X-ray regime is complementary in this\nregard and we use XMM-Newton observations to support the identification of AGN\nbehind the SMC. Methods: We present a catalogue of AGN behind the SMC by\ncorrelating an updated X-ray point source catalogue from our XMM-Newton survey\nof the SMC with already known AGN from the literature as well as a list of\ncandidates obtained from the ALLWISE mid-infrared colour selection criterion.\nWe studied the properties of the sample with respect to their redshifts,\nluminosities and X-ray spectral characteristics. We also identified the\nnear-infrared counterpart of the sources from the VISTA observations. Results:\nThe redshift and luminosity distributions of the sample (where known) indicate\nthat we detect sources from nearby Seyfert galaxies to distant and obscured\nquasars. The X-ray hardness ratios are compatible with those typically expected\nfor AGN.

However,\nin challenging speaking styles, such as Lombard speech, it is difficult to\nrecord sufficiently large speech corpora. Therefore, in this study we propose a\ntransfer learning method to adapt a sequence-to-sequence based TTS system of\nnormal speaking style to Lombard style. Moreover, we experiment with a WaveNet\nvocoder in synthesis of Lombard speech. We conducted subjective evaluations to\nassess the performance of the adapted TTS systems. The subjective evaluation\nresults indicated that an adaptation system with the WaveNet vocoder clearly\noutperformed the conventional deep neural network based TTS system in synthesis\nof Lombard speech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 10:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Here, we present a simple computational\nmodel showing spontaneous emergence of AF that strongly supports, and gives a\ntheoretical explanation for, the clinically observed diversity of activation.\nWe show that the difference in surface activation patterns is a direct\nconsequence of the thickness of the discrete network of heart muscle cells\nthrough which electrical signals percolate to reach the imaged surface.

Recently\nemerged field of all-dielectric nanophotonics employs optically induced\nelectric and magnetic Mie resonances in dielectric nanoparticles with a high\nrefractive index. This property allows obtaining additional valuable degrees of\nfreedom to control optical responses of nanophotonic structures. Here we\npropose a conceptually distinct approach towards reaching optical resonances in\ndielectric nanoparticles. We show that lacking conventional Mie resonances,\nlow-index nanoparticles can exhibit a novel anisotropy-induced family of\nnon-Mie eigenmodes. Specifically, we investigate light interactions with\ncalcite and vaterite nanospheres and compare them with the Mie scattering by a\nfused silica sphere. Having close permittivities and same dimensions, these\nparticles exhibit significantly different scattering behavior owing to their\ninternal structure. While a fused silica sphere does not demonstrate any\nspectral features, the uniaxial structure of the permittivity tensor for\ncalcite and non-diagonal permittivity tensor for vaterite result in a set of\ndistinguishable peaks in scattering spectra. Multipole decomposition and\neigenmode analysis reveal that these peaks are associated with a new family of\nelectric and magnetic resonances. We identify magnetic dipole modes of\nordinary, extraordinary and hybrid polarization as well as complex electric\ndipole resonances, featuring a significant toroidal electric dipole moment. As\nboth vaterite and calcite are biominerals, naturally synthesized and exploited\nby a variety of living organisms, our results provide an indispensable toolbox\nfor understanding and elucidation of mechanisms behind optical functionalities\nof true biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 12:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Session types are a formalism that is proposed to specify interactions\nbetween communicating processes. In essence, a session type system is a kind of\ntype system designed to enforce (through type-checking) that the involved\nprocesses communicate according to a chosen protocol specified as a session\ntype. It is well-known that linear logic plays a pivotal role in the study of\nsession types. For instance, various inference rules in linear logic can be\ninterpreted as ways for constructing channels (used by communicating processes\nto send/receive messages.) A particularly interesting case is the cut-rule in\nlinear logic, which can be interpreted as a way for connecting the ends of two\nmatching channels to form a single new channel. This form of channel\nconstruction is often referred to as linking or (bi-directional) forwarding. We\nhave generalized classical linear logic into classical linear multirole logic\n(LMRL), where the former can be seen as a special case of the latter involving\nonly two roles. In LMRL, there is a cut-rule involving multiple sequents\n(instead of exactly two), which we call multiparty cut (mp-cut). We have also\nformulated a novel multiparty session type system directly based on LMRL. When\nimplementing it, we need to find a way of connecting multiple channels that\ncorresponds to mp-cut. In this paper, we describe an implementation of linking\nfor multiparty sessions in the setting of shared memory. We also describe two\nnovel concepts, two-way linking with residual and three-way linking, which can\nonly be formulated in the setting of multiparty sessions.

Some\nof these algorithms depend on propagating information between distant nodes in\na graph. Recently, there have been a number of deep learning architectures\nproposed to learn on undirected graphs. However, most of these architectures\naggregate information in the local neighborhood of a node, and therefore they\nmay not be capable of efficiently propagating long-range information. To solve\nthis problem we examine a recently proposed architecture, wave, which\npropagates information back and forth across an undirected graph in waves of\nnonlinear computation. We compare wave to graph convolution, an architecture\nbased on local aggregation, and find that wave learns three different\ngraph-based tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy. These three tasks\ninclude (1) labeling a path connecting two nodes in a graph, (2) solving a maze\npresented as an image, and (3) computing voltages in a circuit.

Common\ntechniques either match the current image against keyframes with known poses,\ndirectly regress the pose, or establish correspondences between keypoints in\nthe image and points in the scene to estimate the pose. In recent years,\nregression forests have become a popular alternative to establish such\ncorrespondences. They achieve accurate results, but have traditionally needed\nto be trained offline on the target scene, preventing relocalisation in new\nenvironments. Recently, we showed how to circumvent this limitation by adapting\na pre-trained forest to a new scene on the fly. The adapted forests achieved\nrelocalisation performance that was on par with that of offline forests, and\nour approach was able to estimate the camera pose in close to real time. In\nthis paper, we present an extension of this work that achieves significantly\nbetter relocalisation performance whilst running fully in real time. To achieve\nthis, we make several changes to the original approach: (i) instead of\naccepting the camera pose hypothesis without question, we make it possible to\nscore the final few hypotheses using a geometric approach and select the most\npromising; (ii) we chain several instantiations of our relocaliser together in\na cascade, allowing us to try faster but less accurate relocalisation first,\nonly falling back to slower, more accurate relocalisation as necessary; and\n(iii) we tune the parameters of our cascade to achieve effective overall\nperformance. These changes allow us to significantly improve upon the\nperformance our original state-of-the-art method was able to achieve on the\nwell-known 7-Scenes and Stanford 4 Scenes benchmarks.

Association studies have been widely used to search for\nassociations between common genetic variants observations and a given\nphenotype.

In this work we\nconsider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize\nan observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic\nmarker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are\navailable in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation\nuniquely. Objective. Our focus is on detecting interactions between groups of\ngenetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the\ncomplex relationship between environment and genome in the expression of a\ngiven phenotype. Contributions. We propose a novel approach for efficiently\ndetecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional\nsetting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces\nthe dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in\nthe two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted\ngroup structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso\nselection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of\npotential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing.

To identify the direction of influence, we apply the concept of Granger\ncausality to the time series of facial expressions on the set of relevant\nintervals. We tested our approach on synthetic data and then applied it to\nnewly, experimentally obtained data. Here, we were able to show that a more\nsensitive facial expression detection algorithm and a relevant interval\ndetection approach is most promising to reveal the cause-effect pattern for\ndyadic communication in various instructed interaction conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

Therefore, there is an\nurgent need for automatic image quality assessment techniques.

These\nnetworks have mostly been developed for regular Euclidean domains such as those\nsupporting images, audio, or video. Because of their success, CNN-based methods\nare becoming increasingly popular in Cosmology. Cosmological data often comes\nas spherical maps, which make the use of the traditional CNNs more complicated.\nThe commonly used pixelization scheme for spherical maps is the Hierarchical\nEqual Area isoLatitude Pixelisation (HEALPix). We present a spherical CNN for\nanalysis of full and partial HEALPix maps, which we call DeepSphere. The\nspherical CNN is constructed by representing the sphere as a graph. Graphs are\nversatile data structures that can act as a discrete representation of a\ncontinuous manifold. Using the graph-based representation, we define many of\nthe standard CNN operations, such as convolution and pooling. With filters\nrestricted to being radial, our convolutions are equivariant to rotation on the\nsphere, and DeepSphere can be made invariant or equivariant to rotation. This\nway, DeepSphere is a special case of a graph CNN, tailored to the HEALPix\nsampling of the sphere. This approach is computationally more efficient than\nusing spherical harmonics to perform convolutions. We demonstrate the method on\na classification problem of weak lensing mass maps from two cosmological models\nand compare the performance of the CNN with that of two baseline classifiers.\nThe results show that the performance of DeepSphere is always superior or equal\nto both of these baselines. For high noise levels and for data covering only a\nsmaller fraction of the sphere, DeepSphere achieves typically 10% better\nclassification accuracy than those baselines.

We obtained ultraviolet spectra using COS on HST and optical spectra\nusing FEROS on the MPG/ESO 2.2-m telescope that were simultaneous with X-ray\nspectra from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. We find new components of broad,\nblue-shifted absorption associated with Ly$\\alpha$, \\ion{N}{v}, \\ion{Si}{iv},\nand \\ion{C}{iv} in our COS spectra. The absorption extends from velocities near\nzero in the rest-frame of the host galaxy to $-6200$ $\\rm km~s^{-1}$. These\nfeatures appear for the first time in NGC 3783 at the same time as the heavy\nsoft X-ray absorption seen in the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The X-ray\nabsorption has a column density of $\\sim 10^{23}~\\rm cm^{-2}$, and it partially\ncovers the X-ray continuum source. The X-ray absorption becomes more\ntransparent in the second observation, as does the UV absorption. Combining the\nX-ray column densities with the UV spectral observations yields an ionization\nparameter for the obscuring gas of log $\\xi =1.84^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ $\\rm\nerg~cm~s^{-1}$.

It includes a traditional\nwhite-light coronagraph and a Lyman-alpha coronagraph which opens a new window\nto CME observations. Polarization measurements taken by white-light\ncoronagraphs are crucial to derive fundamental physical parameters of CMEs. To\nmake such measurements, there are two options of Stokes polarimeter which have\nbeen used by existing white-light coronagraphs for space missions. One uses a\nsingle or triple linear polarizers, the other involves both a half-wave plate\nand a linear polarizer.

J. C. Maxwell was the first\nto introduce the quaternions to describe the physical properties of\nelectromagnetic fields. Nowadays the octonions can be applied to study\nsimultaneously the physical quantities of electromagnetic and gravitational\nfields, including the transformation between two coordinate systems. In the\noctonion space, the radius vector can be combined with the integrating function\nof field potential to become one composite radius vector. The latter is\nconsidered as the radius vector in an octonion composite space, which belongs\nto the function spaces.
