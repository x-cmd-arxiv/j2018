However, no single DL framework, to date, dominates in terms\nof performance and accuracy even for baseline classification tasks on standard\ndatasets, making the selection of a DL framework an overwhelming task. This\npaper takes a holistic approach to conduct empirical comparison and analysis of\nfour representative DL frameworks with three unique contributions. First, given\na selection of CPU-GPU configurations, we show that for a specific DL\nframework, different configurations of its hyper-parameters may have a\nsignificant impact on both performance and accuracy of DL applications. Second,\nto the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the\nopportunities for improving the training time performance and the accuracy of\nDL frameworks by configuring parallel computing libraries and tuning individual\nand multiple hyper-parameters. Third, we also conduct a comparative measurement\nstudy on the resource consumption patterns of four DL frameworks and their\nperformance and accuracy implications, including CPU and memory usage, and\ntheir correlations to varying settings of hyper-parameters under different\nconfiguration combinations of hardware, parallel computing libraries. We argue\nthat this measurement study provides in-depth empirical comparison and analysis\nof four representative DL frameworks, and offers practical guidance for service\nproviders to deploying and delivering DL as a Service (DLaaS) and for\napplication developers and DLaaS consumers to select the right DL frameworks\nfor the right DL workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 16:03:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 18:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Cell-based models represent individual\ncells as single particles or as sets of interconnected particles, and predict\nthe collective cell behavior that follows from a set of interaction rules. In\nparticular, vertex-based models are a popular tool for studying the mechanics\nof confluent, epithelial cell layers. They represent the junctions between\nthree (or sometimes more) cells in confluent tissues as point particles,\nconnected using structural elements that represent the cell boundaries. A\ndisadvantage of these models is that cell-cell interfaces are represented as\nstraight lines. This is a suitable simplification for epithelial tissues, where\nthe interfaces are typically under tension, but this simplification may not be\nappropriate for mesenchymal tissues or tissues that are under compression, such\nthat the cell-cell boundaries can buckle. In this paper we introduce a variant\nof VMs in which this and two other limitations of VMs have been resolved.

It is an extension of the open-source package VirtualLeaf, which\nwas initially developed to simulate plant tissue morphogenesis where cells do\nnot move relative to one another. The present extension of VirtualLeaf\nintroduces a new rule for cell-cell shear or sliding, from which T1 and T2\ntransitions emerge naturally, allowing application of VirtualLeaf to problems\nof animal development.

We showed\nthat novae could be the Galactic lithium source accounting for the observed\nincrease of Li abundances in the thin disk with stellar metallicity.

Lithium\nin halo stars is depleted by ~ 0.35 dex, assuming the pristine abundance from\nstandard big bang nucleosynthesis. We elaborate a model that matches the\npristine stellar abundances, assuming that all stars are depleted by 0.35 dex.\nIn this case, the delay remains the same, but the Li yields are doubled\ncompared to the previous case. This model also has the merit to match the Li\nabundance in meteorites and young TTauri stars. The thick disk model, adopting\nthe parameters derived for the thin disk, can also explain the absence of\nincrease of Li abundances in its stars. The thick disk is old, but formed and\nevolved in a time shorter than that required by novae to contribute\nsignificantly to Li. Therefore, no Li enhancement is expected in thick disk\nstars. We show that the almost constant Li abundance in the thick disk results\nfrom the compensation of stellar astration by spallation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 16:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

This suggests that the radial stellar population distribution\nwithin a galaxys effective radius is primarily a result of the \\emph{in-situ}\nlocal star formation history.

This large\nadvance in the state of the art is enabled by our release of the new MAESTRO\n(MIDI and Audio Edited for Synchronous TRacks and Organization) dataset,\ncomposed of over 172 hours of virtuosic piano performances captured with fine\nalignment (~3 ms) between note labels and audio waveforms. The networks and the\ndataset together present a promising approach toward creating new expressive\nand interpretable neural models of music.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 16:48:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 18:54:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 19:43:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 01:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 19:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

However, the x-ray radiation\nexposure leads to the concern of lifetime cancer risk. Low-dose CT scan can\nreduce the radiation exposure to patient while the image quality is usually\ndegraded due to the appearance of noise and artifacts. Numerous studies have\nbeen conducted to regularize CT image for better image quality. Yet, exploring\nthe underlying manifold where real CT images residing on is still an open\nproblem. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven manifold learning\napproach by incorporating the emerging deep-learning technology. An\nencoder-decoder convolutional neural network has been established to map a CT\nimage to the inherent low-dimensional manifold, as well as to restore the CT\nimage from its corresponding manifold representation.

In order to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework, network training, testing, and\ncomprehensive simulation study have been performed using patient abdomen CT\nimages. The trained encoder-decoder CNN is capable of restoring high-quality CT\nimages with average error of ~20 HU. Furthermore, the proposed manifold prior\nassisted reconstruction scheme achieves high-quality low-dose CT\nreconstruction, with average reconstruction error of < 30 HU, more than five\ntimes and two times lower than that of filtered back projection method and\ntotal-variation based iterative reconstruction method, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 17:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-30"}

We\ndemonstrate via transient and absolute photoluminescence (PL) experiments how\nthe incorporation of Sr significantly reduces the non-radiative recombination\nlosses in the neat perovskite layer and specifically at the perovskite/C60\ninterface. We show that Sr segregates at the perovskite surface, where it\ninduces important changes of morphology and energetics. Notably, the\nSr-enriched surface exhibits a wider band gap and a more n-type character,\naccompanied with significantly stronger surface band bending. As a result, we\nobserve a significant increase of the quasi-Fermi level splitting in the neat\nperovskite by reduced surface recombination and more importantly, a strong\nreduction of losses attributed to non-radiative recombination at the interface\nto the C60 electron-transporting layer.

Our framework contains a diverse set of\nenvironments, our methodology covers both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution generalization, and our evaluation includes deep RL\nalgorithms that specifically tackle generalization. Our key finding is that\n`vanilla' deep RL algorithms generalize better than specialized schemes that\nwere proposed specifically to tackle generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 17:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 17:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

We find that\ngradients in age, sSFR and O/H depend on the galaxy's position on the\nSigma_1kpc-M* diagram, suggesting at least two evolutionary pathways. The first\npathway consists of galaxies with low Sigma_1kpc for their M* whose centres are\nold, metal-rich and suppressed in sSFR compared to their outskirts, consistent\nwith the inside-out growth scenario.

Here we identify a key signature of the\ncollision-dominated hydrodynamic regime---a magnon sound mode---which governs\ndynamics at low frequencies and can be detected with recently-introduced spin\nqubit magnetometers. The magnon sound mode is an excitation of the longitudinal\nspin component with frequencies below the spin wave continuum in gapped\nferromagnets. We also show that, in the presence of exchange interactions with\nSU(2) symmetry, the ferromagnet hosts an usual hydrodynamic regime that lacks\nGalilean symmetry at all energy and lengthscales. The hydrodynamic sound mode,\nif detected, can lead to a new platform to explore hydrodynamic behavior in\nquantum materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 18:16:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2020 02:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

Here, we use a combination of hydrodynamic simulations\nand general physical arguments to demonstrate that UHECRs can in principle be\nproduced by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in shocks in the backflowing\nmaterial of radio galaxy lobes. These shocks occur after the jet material has\npassed through the relativistic termination shock. Recently, several authors\nhave demonstrated that highly relativistic shocks are not effective in\naccelerating UHECRs. The shocks in our proposed model have a range of\nnon-relativistic or mildly relativistic shock velocities more conducive to\nUHECR acceleration, with shock sizes in the range 1-10kpc. Approximately 10% of\nthe jet's energy flux is focused through a shock in the backflow of $M>3$.\nAlthough the shock velocities can be low enough that acceleration to high\nenergy via DSA is still efficient, they are also high enough for the Hillas\nenergy to approach $10^{19-20}$eV, particularly for heavier CR composition and\nin cases where fluid elements pass through multiple shocks. We discuss some of\nthe more general considerations for acceleration of particles to ultra-high\nenergy with reference to giant-lobed radio galaxies such as Centaurus A and\nFornax A, a class of sources which may be responsible for the observed\nanisotropies from UHECR observatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 18:58:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

Optimal closure refers to a general method of\nreduction for Hamiltonian systems, in which macroscopic states are required to\nbelong to a parametric family of distributions on phase space. In the case of\npoint vortex ensembles, the macroscopic variables describe the spatially\ncoarse-grained vorticity. Dynamical closure in terms of those macrostates is\nobtained by optimizing over paths in the parameter space of the reduced model\nsubject to the constraints imposed by conserved quantities. This optimization\nminimizes a cost functional that quantifies the rate of information loss due to\nmodel reduction, meaning that an optimal path represents a macroscopic\nevolution that is most compatible with the microscopic dynamics in an\ninformation-theoretic sense. A near-equilibrium linearization of this method is\nused to derive dissipative equations for the low-order spatial moments of\nensembles of point vortices in the plane. These severely reduced models\ndescribe the late-stage evolution of coherent structures in two-dimensional and\ngeostrophic turbulence. For single-layer dynamics, they approximate the\nrelaxation of initially distorted structures toward axisymmetric equilibrium\nstates.

Various studies have relied on autoregressive\nmoving-average (ARMA) processes to simulate synthetic series of wave parameters\nin a Monte Carlo sense. However, accurately representing inter-series\ndependencies has remained a challenge. In particular, the relationship between\nwave height and period statistics is complex, due to the limiting steepness\ncondition. Here, we present a new simulation method for joint time series of\nsignificant wave height, mean zero-crossing periods and a directional regime\nvariable. The latter distinguishes between northern and southwestern waves. The\nmethod rests on several model components which include renewal processes,\nFourier series with random coefficients, ARMA processes, copulas and\nregime-switching. A particular feature is a data-driven estimate for a wave\nheight-dependent limiting wave steepness condition which is used to facilitate\ncopulabased dependence modeling. The method was developed for and applied to a\ndata set in the Southern North Sea. For this site, the method could simulate\ntime series with realistic annual cycles and inter-annual variability. In the\ntime series data, the bivariate distribution of significant wave height and\nmean zero-crossing period was well represented. An influence of the directional\nregime on the bivariate distribution could also be modeled. However, the\ninfluence was not as strong in simulated data as in observed data. Finally,\nsimulated series captured duration and inter-arrival time of storm events well.\nPotential applications for output of the simulation method range from the\nassessment of coastal risks or design of coastal structures to the planning and\nbudgeting of offshore operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 20:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

A significant\ndrawback of the state-of-the-art have been designing a WCN in which the\nservice-oriented performance measures (e.g., throughput) are optimized without\nconsidering different relevant decisions such as determining the location and\nallocating the resources, jointly. In this study, we address the UAVBS location\nand bandwidth allocation problems together to optimize the total network\nprofit. In particular, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP)\nformulation is developed, in which the location of a single UAVBS and bandwidth\nallocations to users are jointly determined. The objective is to maximize the\ntotal profit without exceeding the backhaul and access capacities. The profit\ngained from a specific user is assumed to be a piecewise-linear function of the\nprovided data rate level, where higher data rate levels would yield higher\nprofit. Due to high complexity of the MINLP, we propose an efficient heuristic\nalgorithm with lower computational complexity. We show that, when the UAVBS\nlocation is determined, the resource allocation problem can be reduced to a\nMultidimensional Binary Knapsack Problem (MBKP), which can be solved in\npseudo-polynomial time. To exploit this structure, the optimal bandwidth\nallocations are determined by solving several MBKPs in a search algorithm.

This function is based on a generalized opinion dynamics model and\ncaptures how the activity level and network connectivity of the bots shift\nequilibrium opinions. To apply generalized harmonic influence centrality to\nreal social networks, we develop a deep neural network to measure the opinions\nof users based on their social network posts. Using this neural network, we\nthen calculate the generalized harmonic influence centrality of bots in\nmultiple real social networks.

For the analysis we use observations in multiple wavelengths\n(EUV, X-rays, H$\\alpha$, and magnetograms) from a variety of ground-based and\nspace instruments. The magnetic configuration showed the presence of two\nrotating bipoles, with decreasing magnetic flux, within the following polarity\nof the AR. This evolution was present along some tens of hours before the\nstudied event and continued even later. A minifilament with a length of\n$\\approx 30 \\arcsec$ lay along the photospheric inversion line of the largest\nbipole. The minifilament was observed to erupt accompanied by an M4.7 flare\n(SOL20120509T12:23:00). Consequently, dense material, as well as twist, was\ninjected along closed loops in the form of a very broad ejection whose\nmorphology resembles that of typical H$\\alpha$ surges. We conclude that the\nflare and eruption can be explained as due to two reconnection processes, one\noccurring below the erupting minifilament and another one above it. This second\nprocess injects the minifilament plasma within the reconnected closed loops\nlinking the main AR polarities.

Our\nalgorithm uses a light-weight screening model to predict a much smaller set of\ncandidate words based on the given context, and then conducts an exact softmax\nonly within that subset.

We examine the\nformation of UFDs by twice running a fully cosmological simulations of dwarf\ngalaxies, but varying star formation. One run uses a temperature-density\nthreshold for star formation, while the other uses an H$_{2}$-based sub-grid\nstar formation model. The total number of dwarf galaxies that forms is\ndifferent by a factor of 2 between the two runs, but most of these are\nsatellites, leading to a factor of 5 difference in the number of luminous UFD\ncompanions around more massive, isolated dwarfs. The first run yields a 47\\%\nchance of finding a satellite around a M$_{halo}$ $\\sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nhost, while the H$_2$ run predicts only a 16\\% chance. Metallicity is the\nprimary physical parameter that creates this difference. As metallicity\ndecreases, the formation of H$_2$ is slowed and relegated to higher-density\nmaterial. Thus, our H$_2$ run is unable to form many (and often, any) stars\nbefore reionization removes gas. These results emphasize that predictions for\nUFD properties made using hydrodynamic simulations, in particular regarding the\nfrequency of satellites around dwarf galaxies, the slope of the stellar mass\nfunction at low masses, as well as the properties of ultra-faint galaxies\noccupying the smallest halos, are extremely sensitive to the subgrid physics of\nstar formation contained within the simulation.

Their central frequencies are typical of the orbital motion\ntimescale close to the compact object. HF QPOs are believed to carry unique\ninformation on the matter moving in the extreme gravitational field around the\ncompact object. In previous works we highlighted the work done by strong tides\non clumps of plasma orbiting in the accretion disk as suitable mechanism to\nproduce the HF QPOs. We showed that the upper of the twin peak HF QPOs seen in\nNS LMXBs could originate from the tidal circularization of the clump's\nrelativistic orbit, while the lower HF QPO could come from the spiraling clump\nlosing orbital energy. Here we focus on the tidal deformation of a magnetized\nclump of plasma once tides load energy on it. The likely evolution of the shape\nof the clump after tidal circularization of the orbit and its subsequent\norbital evolution are investigated.

Under PSC, P-V characteristic of PV arrays will have\nmultiple peak points, only one of which is global maximum. Conventional maximum\npower point tracking (MPPT) methods are not able to extract maximum power in\nthis condition. In this paper, a novel two-stage MPPT method is presented to\novercome this drawback. In the first stage, a method is proposed to determine\nthe occurrence of PSC, and in the second stage, using a new algorithm that is\nbased on ramp change of the duty cycle and continuous sampling from the P-V\ncharacteristic of the array, global maximum power point of array is reached.\nP&O algorithm is then re-activated to trace small changes of the new MPP. Open\nloop operation of the proposed method makes its implementation cheap and\nsimple. The method is robust in the face of changing environmental conditions\nand array characteristics, and has minimum negative impact on the connected\npower system.

Several studies suggested that the\nunbalanced flow is responsible for E-PI sometimes significantly underpredicting\n$V_{\\rm max}$.

Conventional methods for this task look at sentences on\ntheir individual merit and thus do not optimize the informativeness of\nsentences as a set. We show that our proposed method which builds on the idea\nof unfolding a greedy algorithm into a computational graph allows both\ninterpretability and gradient-based training. The proposed differentiable\ngreedy network (DGN) outperforms discrete optimization algorithms as well as\nother baseline methods in terms of precision and recall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

A potentially large number of meta-paths can be\nextracted from the heterogeneous networks, providing abundant semantic\nknowledge. Though a variety of meta-paths can be defined, too many meta-paths\nare redundant. Reduction on the number of meta-paths can enhance the\neffectiveness since some redundant meta-paths provide interferential linkage to\nthe task. Moreover, the reduced meta-paths can reflect the characteristic of\nthe heterogeneous network. Previous endeavors try to reduce the number of\nmeta-paths under the guidance of supervision information. Nevertheless,\nsupervised information is expensive and may not always be available. In this\npaper, we propose a novel algorithm, SPMR (Semantic Preserving Meta-path\nReduction), to reduce a set of pre-defined meta-paths in an unsupervised\nsetting. The proposed method is able to evaluate a set of meta-paths to\nmaximally preserve the semantics of original meta-paths after reduction.\nExperimental results show that SPMR can select a succinct subset of meta-paths\nwhich can achieve comparable or even better performance with fewer meta-paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 03:01:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 02:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

For this, we studied 93\nmajor flaring ARs observed from 2010 to 2016 by the Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).

Two extensive simulation studies are used to\ncompare with some existing methods.

Despite its significant progress in recent years, there are\nstill two challenging issues in the current ensemble clustering research.\nFirst, most of the existing algorithms tend to investigate the ensemble\ninformation at the object-level, yet often lack the ability to explore the rich\ninformation at higher levels of granularity. Second, they mostly focus on the\ndirect connections (e.g., direct intersection or pair-wise co-occurrence) in\nthe multiple base clusterings, but generally neglect the multi-scale indirect\nrelationship hidden in them. To address these two issues, this paper presents a\nnovel ensemble clustering approach based on fast propagation of cluster-wise\nsimilarities via random walks. We first construct a cluster similarity graph\nwith the base clusters treated as graph nodes and the cluster-wise Jaccard\ncoefficient exploited to compute the initial edge weights. Upon the constructed\ngraph, a transition probability matrix is defined, based on which the random\nwalk process is conducted to propagate the graph structural information.\nSpecifically, by investigating the propagating trajectories starting from\ndifferent nodes, a new cluster-wise similarity matrix can be derived by\nconsidering the trajectory relationship. Then, the newly obtained cluster-wise\nsimilarity matrix is mapped from the cluster-level to the object-level to\nachieve an enhanced co-association (ECA) matrix, which is able to\nsimultaneously capture the object-wise co-occurrence relationship as well as\nthe multi-scale cluster-wise relationship in ensembles. Finally, two novel\nconsensus functions are proposed to obtain the consensus clustering result.\nExtensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets have demonstrated the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 06:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

In this work, we\npropose a new model which starts from a binary-layered 1D photonic crystal, and\nby introducing synthetic dimensions the topology of higher dimension systems\ncould appear. From this model, we find that the topology of band gap and the\nChern number of the 2D systems can be predicted by the parity-switching types\nand the Zak phases of the 1D systems with spatial inversion symmetry(SIS),\nrespectively. The chiral edge state is confirmed by the winding number of the\nreflection phase in the topological nontrivial gap. Different types of the\ntopological transition in higher dimensions are found, where two bands\ndegenerated as Weyl point or nodal line. Surprisingly, we find that the\ntopological connection between different dimensions and the topological\ntransition types in this model can be explained by the evolving of two\nsingularities which give rise to nonzero Zak phase of the 1D systems with SIS.\nWhen transporting one singularity between adjacent bands, the Weyl point takes\nthe role as the instantaneous jumping channel of the singularity in the\nparameter space, and then both the Zak phases of 1D systems with SIS and the\nChern number of 2D systems are changed. While both singularities moves to\nband-gap edges from two adjacent bands, they will merge into the nodal line.\nThe theory for such model is also constructed.

In this paper, we first make an observation on\nmulti-location bugs in Defects4J and divide them into two categories (i.e.,\nsimilar and relevant multi-location bugs) based on the repair actions in their\npatches. We then summarize the situation of multi-location bugs in Defects4J\nfixed by current tools. We analyze the twenty-two patches generated by current\ntools and propose two feasible strategies for fixing multi-location bugs,\nillustrating them through two detailed case studies. At last, the experimental\nresults prove the feasibility of our methods with the repair of two bugs that\nhave never been fixed before. By learning from successful experience in the\npast, this paper points out possible ways ahead for multi-location program\nrepair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 07:30:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 01:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

The\nspin-momentum locking of the Weyl Hamiltonian leads to a coupling between\ncharge and longitudinal spin fluctuations, while transverse spin fluctuations\nremain decoupled from the charge. A real Weyl semimetal with multiple Weyl\nnodes can show this charge-spin coupling in equilibrium if its crystal symmetry\nis sufficiently low. All Weyl semimetals are expected to show this coupling if\nthey are driven into a non-equilibrium stationary state with different\noccupations of Weyl nodes, for example by exploiting the chiral anomaly. Based\non the response tensor, we investigate the low-energy collective excitations of\ninteracting Weyl fermions. For a local Hubbard interaction, the charge-spin\ncoupling leads to a dramatic change of the zero-sound dispersion: its velocity\nbecomes independent of the interaction strength and the chemical potential and\nis given solely by the Fermi velocity. In the presence of long-range Coulomb\ninteractions, the coupling transforms the plasmon modes into spin plasmons. For\nreal Weyl semimetals with multiple Weyl nodes, the collective modes are\nstrongly affected by the presence of parallel static electric and magnetic\nfields, due to the chiral anomaly.

One proposed solution\nto the challenges induced by rain and snowfall is to artificially remove the\nrain from images or video using rain removal algorithms. It is the promise of\nthese algorithms that the rain-removed image frames will improve the\nperformance of subsequent segmentation and tracking algorithms. However, rain\nremoval algorithms are typically evaluated on their ability to remove synthetic\nrain on a small subset of images. Currently, their behavior is unknown on\nreal-world videos when integrated with a typical computer vision pipeline. In\nthis paper, we review the existing rain removal algorithms and propose a new\ndataset that consists of 22 traffic surveillance sequences under a broad\nvariety of weather conditions that all include either rain or snowfall. We\npropose a new evaluation protocol that evaluates the rain removal algorithms on\ntheir ability to improve the performance of subsequent segmentation, instance\nsegmentation, and feature tracking algorithms under rain and snow. If\nsuccessful, the de-rained frames of a rain removal algorithm should improve\nsegmentation performance and increase the number of accurately tracked\nfeatures. The results show that a recent single-frame-based rain removal\nalgorithm increases the segmentation performance by 19.7% on our proposed\ndataset, but it eventually decreases the feature tracking performance and\nshowed mixed results with recent instance segmentation methods. However, the\nbest video-based rain removal algorithm improves the feature tracking accuracy\nby 7.72%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 08:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

To address this gap in perception, we propose a\nnovel approach for learning robust classifier. Our main idea is: adversarial\nexamples for the robust classifier should be indistinguishable from the regular\ndata of the adversarial target. We formulate a problem of learning robust\nclassifier in the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), where the\nadversarial attack on classifier acts as a generator, and the critic network\nlearns to distinguish between regular and adversarial images. The classifier\ncost is augmented with the objective that its adversarial examples should\nconfuse the adversary critic. To improve the stability of the adversarial\nmapping, we introduce adversarial cycle-consistency constraint which ensures\nthat the adversarial mapping of the adversarial examples is close to the\noriginal.

These rough surfaces play a major role in the\ndissolution of rocks around stressed contacts, the transport of dissolved\nmaterial and the precipitation in surrounding pores. Consequently, they play an\nactive role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties\nin the Earth's crust. They are observed individually or in networks, in\nproximity to fractures and joints, and in numerous geological settings. This\nreview article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics\nand the factors leading to their genesis. The main questions this review\nfocuses on are the following: How do they form? How can they be used to measure\nstrain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust?\nGeometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical\nproperties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling\nwith Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of\nmicrons), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate\nscale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary\nstylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling\n(scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in\nthe case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles\nfrom physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical\ncomponent for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a\nprecise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder\non the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce\nstylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although\nmicrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth\ndeforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is\nunderstandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally,\nthe applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine\npaleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite\nheights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine\nthe stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface\nduring the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite\nplane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that\nthe crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric)\nscales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the\ntotal amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth\nstart to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total\ndeformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss\nthe impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of\nthe hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel\nto the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the\nstylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the\ndevelopment of the stylolite.\n  Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure,\nstress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties,\nnetwork structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based\nnumerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as\nmarkers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact\ntransport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 08:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-31"}

At long times and in a\nnarrow window of modulation frequencies around each resonance, we observe a\nrelaxation to asymptotic states that are unstable without drive. These\nstationary states correspond to phase-locked solutions of the Josephson\nequations generalized to include dissipation, and are analogous to the\nstationary states of driven superconducting junctions.

In such systems, human responsibility becomes equivocal.\nUnderstanding human casual responsibility is particularly important when\nintelligent autonomous systems can harm people, as with autonomous vehicles or,\nmost notably, with autonomous weapon systems (AWS). Using Information Theory,\nwe develop a responsibility quantification (ResQu) model of human involvement\nin intelligent automated systems and demonstrate its applications on decisions\nregarding AWS. The analysis reveals that human comparative responsibility to\noutcomes is often low, even when major functions are allocated to the human.\nThus, broadly stated policies of keeping humans in the loop and having\nmeaningful human control are misleading and cannot truly direct decisions on\nhow to involve humans in intelligent systems and advanced automation. The\ncurrent model is an initial step in the complex goal to create a comprehensive\nresponsibility model, that will enable quantification of human causal\nresponsibility. It assumes stationarity, full knowledge regarding the\ncharacteristic of the human and automation and ignores temporal aspects.\nDespite these limitations, it can aid in the analysis of systems designs\nalternatives and policy decisions regarding human responsibility in intelligent\nsystems and advanced automation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 10:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 08:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 07:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 15:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

We start by considering a deterministic\nreaction-diffusion equation and show how external forcing can cause temporally\ncorrelated or coloured noise. Here, the main source of external noise is\nconsidered to be fluctuations in the parameter values representing the inflow\nof particles to the system. First, we determine which reaction systems, driven\nby extrinsic noise, can admit only one steady state, so that effects, such as\nstochastic switching, are precluded from our analysis. To analyse the steady\nstate behaviour of reaction systems, even if the parameter values are changing,\nnecessitates a parameter-free approach, which has been central to algebraic\nanalysis in chemical reaction network theory. To identify suitable models we\nuse tools from real algebraic geometry that link the network structure to its\ndynamical properties. We then make a connection to internal noise models and\nshow how power spectral methods can be used to predict stochastically driven\npatterns in systems with coloured noise. In simple cases we show that the power\nspectrum of the coloured noise process and the power spectrum of the\nreaction-diffusion system modelled with white noise multiply to give the power\nspectrum of the coloured noise reaction-diffusion system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 11:19:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 13:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

We aim to constrain the mechanisms dominating the particle transport\nwithin the nebula, accounting for its anomalously large size and spectral\ncharacteristics. Methods: The nebula is studied using a deep exposure from over\n12 years of H.E.S.S. I operation, together with data from H.E.S.S. II improving\nthe low energy sensitivity. Enhanced energy-dependent morphological and\nspatially-resolved spectral analyses probe the Very High Energy (VHE, E > 0.1\nTeV) gamma-ray properties of the nebula. Results: The nebula emission is\nrevealed to extend out to 1.5 degrees from the pulsar, ~1.5 times further than\npreviously seen, making HESS J1825--137, with an intrinsic diameter of ~100 pc,\npotentially the largest gamma-ray PWN currently known. Characterisation of the\nnebula's strongly energy-dependent morphology enables the particle transport\nmechanisms to be constrained. A dependence of the nebula extent with energy of\nR $\\propto$ E^\\alpha with \\alpha = -0.29 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.05 (sys)\ndisfavours a pure diffusion scenario for particle transport within the nebula.\nThe total gamma-ray flux of the nebula above 1~TeV is found to be (1.12 +/-\n0.03 (stat) +/- 0.25 (sys)) $\\times 10^{-11}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding\nto ~64% of the flux of the Crab Nebula. Conclusions: HESS J1825-137 is a PWN\nwith clear energy-dependent morphology at VHE gamma-ray energies.

We exploit diverse human commonsense\nknowledge for reasoning over large-scale object categories and reaching\nsemantic coherency within one image. Particularly, we present Hybrid Knowledge\nRouted Modules (HKRM) that incorporates the reasoning routed by two kinds of\nknowledge forms: an explicit knowledge module for structured constraints that\nare summarized with linguistic knowledge (e.g. shared attributes,\nrelationships) about concepts; and an implicit knowledge module that depicts\nsome implicit constraints (e.g. common spatial layouts).

The increasing interest in compact\nradio cores of AGNs requires determination of the RLF based on core emission\n(i.e., core RLF). In this work we have established a large sample (totaling\n1207) of radio-loud AGNs, mainly consisting of radio galaxies (RGs) and\nsteep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs). Based on the sample, we explore the\nrelationship between core luminosity ($L_c$) and total luminosity ($L_t$) via a\npowerful statistical tool called \"Copula\". The conditional probability\ndistribution $p(\\log L_{c} \\mid \\log L_{t})$ is obtained. We derive the core\nRLF as a convolution of $p(\\log L_{c} \\mid \\log L_{t})$ with the total RLF\nwhich was determined by previous work. We relate the separate RG and SSRQ core\nRLFs via a relativistic beaming model and find that SSRQs have an average\nLorentz factor of $\\gamma=9.84_{-2.50}^{+3.61}$, and that most are seen within\n$8^{\\circ} \\lesssim \\theta \\lesssim 45^{\\circ}$ of the jet axis. Compared with\nthe total RLF which is mainly contributed by extended emission, the core RLF\nshows a very weak luminosity-dependent evolution, with the number density\npeaking around $z\\thicksim 0.8$ for all luminosities. Differences between core\nand total RLFs can be explained in a framework involving a combination of\ndensity and luminosity evolutions where the cores have significantly weaker\nluminosity evolution than the extended emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 13:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Their investigations\nare hindered by the insensitivity of standard physical probes, such as neutron\ndiffraction, to the order parameter that is usually associated with\nhigher-order multipoles of the f-orbitals. The heavy-fermion compound\nCe3Pd20Si6 exhibits magnetically hidden order at subkelvin temperatures, known\nas phase II. Additionally, for magnetic field applied along the [001] cubic\naxis, another phase II' was detected, but the nature of the transition from\nphase II to phase II' remained unclear.

Recently, STAIRoute \\cite{karb2} aimed to address that by\nidentifying the shortest routing path of a net through a set of routing regions\nin the floorplan in multiple metal layers. Since the blocks in hierarchical\nASIC/SoC designs do not use all the permissible routing layers for the internal\nrouting corresponding to standard cell connectivity, the proposed STAIRoute\nframework is not an effective for early global routability assessment. This\nleads to improper utilization of routing area, specifically in higher routing\nlayers with fewer routing blockages, as the lack of placement of standard cells\ndoes not facilitates any routing of their interconnections.\n  This paper presents a generalized model for early global routability\nassessment, HGR, by utilizing the free regions over the blocks beyond certain\nmetal layers.

The origin of the fossil magnetic fields detected in 5 to 10% of\nintermediate-mass main sequence stars is still highly debated. Aims. We want to\nbring observational constraints to a large population of intermediate-mass\npre-main sequence (PMS) stars in order to test the theory that\nconvective-dynamo fields generated during the PMS phases of stellar evolution\ncan occasionally relax into fossil fields on the main sequence. Methods. Using\ndistance estimations, photometric measurements, and spectropolarimetric data\nfrom HARPSpol and ESPaDOnS of 38 intermediate-mass PMS stars, we determined\nfundamental stellar parameters (Teff, L and v sin i) and measured surface\nmagnetic field characteristics (including detection limits for non-detections,\nand longitudinal fields and basic topologies for positive detections). Using\nPMS evolutionary models, we determined the mass, radius, and internal structure\nof these stars. We compared different PMS models to check that our\ndeterminations were not model-dependant. We then compared the magnetic\ncharacteristics of our sample accounting for their stellar parameters and\ninternal structures. Results. We detect magnetic fields in about half of our\nsample. About 90% of the magnetic stars have outer convective envelopes larger\nthan ~25% of the stellar radii, and heavier than ~2% of the stellar mass. Going\nto higher mass, we find that the magnetic incidence in intermediate-mass stars\ndrops very quickly, within a time-scale of the order of few times 0.1 Myr.\nFinally, we propose that intermediate-mass T Tauri stars with large convective\nenvelopes, close to the fully convective limit, have complex fields and that\ntheir dipole component strengths may decrease as the sizes of their convective\nenvelopes decrease, similar to lower-mass T Tauri stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 15:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In\nparticular, this is the situation of an electroweak interacting particle in the\npresence of a uniform magnetic field. We demonstrate first that, in a spatially\nuniform and adiabatically time-varying magnetic field, a proton coupled to the\nleptonic vacuum acquires a kinetic momentum antiparallel to the magnetic field,\nwhereas virtual leptons gain an equivalent Casimir momentum in the opposite\ndirection. Remarkably, leptons remain virtual throughout the process, which\nmeans that the proton acceleration is not caused by the recoil associated to\nthe emission of any actual particle. The kinetic energy of the proton is part\nof its electroweak self-energy, which is provided by the source of magnetic\nfield.

The result are the first\nalgorithms for simultaneous online estimation of contact and aerodynamic\nwrenches acting on the robot based on real-world data, without the need for\ndedicated sensors. For this purpose, we investigate two model-based techniques\nfor discriminating between aerodynamic and interaction forces. The first\ntechnique is based on aerodynamic and contact torque models, and uses the\nexternal force to estimate wind speed. Contacts are then detected based on the\nresidual between estimated external torque and expected (modeled) aerodynamic\ntorque. Upon detecting contact, wind speed is assumed to change very slowly.\nFrom the estimated interaction wrench, we are also able to determine the\ncontact location. This is embedded into a particle filter framework to further\nimprove contact location estimation. The second algorithm uses the propeller\naerodynamic power and angular speed as measured by the speed controllers to\nobtain an estimate of the airspeed. An aerodynamics model is then used to\ndetermine the aerodynamic wrench. Both methods rely on accurate aerodynamics\nmodels. Therefore, we evaluate data-driven and physics based models as well as\noffline system identification for flying robots. For obtaining ground truth\ndata we performed autonomous flights in a 3D wind tunnel.

Our analysis suggests that a minimum of 1.4 billion users will pass away\nbefore 2100 if Facebook ceases to attract new users as of 2018. If the network\ncontinues expanding at current rates, however, this number will exceed 4.9\nbillion. In both cases, a majority of the profiles will belong to non-Western\nusers. In discussing our findings, we draw on the emerging scholarship on\ndigital preservation and stress the challenges arising from curating the\nprofiles of the deceased. We argue that an exclusively commercial approach to\ndata preservation poses important ethical and political risks that demand\nurgent consideration. We call for a scalable, sustainable, and dignified\ncuration model that incorporates the interests of multiple stakeholders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 10:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:46:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 10:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 09:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

We define parallel 2-transport as a 2-functor from\nthe thin fundamental 2-groupoid to the 2-category of 2-group torsors. The\ndefinition of the 2-category of 2-group torsors is new, and we develop the\ntools necessary for computations in this 2-category. We prove a version of the\nnon-Abelian Stokes Theorem and the Ambrose-Singer Theorem for 2-transport. This\ndefinition motivated by the fact that principal $G$-bundles with connection are\nequivalent to functors from the thin fundamental groupoid to the category of\n$G$-torsors. In the same lines we deduce a notion of principal 2-bundle with\n2-connection, and show it is equivalent to our notion 2-transport functors.\nThis gives a stricter notion than appears in the literature, which is more\nconcrete. It allows for computations of 2-holonomy which will be exploited in a\ncompanion paper to define Wilson surface observables. Furthermore this notion\ncan be generalized to a concrete but strict notion of $n$-transport for\narbitrary $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 15:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 15:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

Particularly, microdisk lasers exploiting whispering gallery\nmodes have been regarded as an important candidate because of their relatively\nsmall footprint and low threshold. However, it has been challenging for\nmicrodisk to operate under single mode operation and to lase in a preselected\nmode. We report subwavelength microdisk resonators suspended in air with\nconnecting bridges and propose a simple method using the number and symmetry of\nbridges to enhance or reduce wave confinement in the whispering gallery cavity.\nMoreover, a suitable choice of bridges increases the quality factor of\nmicrodisks compared to microdisks resonator without bridges. Using this method,\nwe demonstrate single mode lasing of preselected modes at telecommunication\nwavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 23:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}
