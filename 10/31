The\nvon Neumann entropy determines, e.g., the capacities of quantum channels. Also,\nentropies of composite quantum systems are important for future quantum\nnetworks, and their characterization is related to the quantum marginal\nproblem. Furthermore, they play a role in quantum thermodynamics. In this\nthesis the set of quantum entropies of multipartite quantum systems is studied.\nThe problem of its characterization is not new -- however, progress has been\nsparse, indicating that the problem might be hard and that new methods might be\nneeded. Here, a variety of different and complementary approaches are taken.\n  First, I look at global properties. It is known that the von Neumann entropy\nregion -- just like its classical counterpart -- forms a convex cone. I\ndescribe the symmetries of this cone and highlight geometric similarities and\ndifferences to the classical entropy cone.\n  In a different approach, I utilize the local geometric properties of extremal\nrays of a cone. I show that quantum states whose entropy lies on such an\nextremal ray of the quantum entropy cone have a very simple structure.\n  As the set of all quantum states is very complicated, I look at a simple\nsubset called stabilizer states. I improve on previously known results by\nshowing that under a technical condition on the local dimension, entropies of\nstabilizer states respect an additional class of information inequalities that\nis valid for random variables from linear codes.\n  In a last approach I find a representation-theoretic formulation of the\nclassical marginal problem simplifying the comparison with its quantum\nmechanical counterpart. This novel correspondence yields a simplified\nformulation of the group characterization of classical entropies (IEEE Trans.\nInf.

A relatively small $\\mu$\nmay lead to heavier Higgs masses ($H^0, A, H^{\\pm}$ in MSSM) which are\nsignificantly lighter than other scalars such as squarks. Such a situation is\nrealized on the hyperbolic branch of radiative breaking of the electroweak\nsymmetry. In this analysis we construct supergravity unified models with\nrelatively small $\\mu$ in the sense described above and discuss the search for\nthe charged Higgs boson $H^{\\pm}$ at HL-LHC and HE-LHC where we also carry out\na relative comparison of the discovery potential of the two using the decay\nchannel $H^{\\pm} \\to \\tau \\nu$. It is shown that an analysis based on the\ntraditional linear cuts on signals and backgrounds is not very successful in\nextracting the signal while, in contrast, machine learning techniques such as\nboosted decision trees prove to be far more effective. Thus it is shown that\nmodels not discoverable with the conventional cut analyses become discoverable\nwith machine learning techniques. Using boosted decision trees we consider\nseveral benchmarks and analyze the potential for their $5\\sigma$ discovery at\nthe 14 TeV HL-LHC and at 27 TeV HE-LHC. It is shown that while the ten\nbenchmarks considered with the charged Higgs boson mass in the range 373 GeV-\n812 GeV are all discoverable at HE-LHC, only four of the ten with Higgs boson\nmasses in the range 373 GeV-470 GeV are discoverable at HL-LHC. Further, while\nthe model points discoverable at both HE-LHC and HL-LHC would require up to 7\nyears of running time at HL-LHC, they could all be discovered in a period of\nfew months at HE-LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 17:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 20:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

One popular way to address this issue is the Stochastic Dual\nDynamic Programming method (SDDP) introduced by Perreira and Pinto in 1991 for\nMarkov Decision Processes. Assuming that the value function is convex (for a\nminimization problem), one builds a non-decreasing sequence of lower (or outer)\nconvex approximations of the value function. Those convex approximations are\nconstructed as a supremum of affine cuts. On continuous time deterministic\noptimal control problems, assuming that the value function is semiconvex, Zheng\nQu, inspired by the work of McEneaney, introduced in 2013 a stochastic max-plus\nscheme that builds upper (or inner) non-increasing approximations of the value\nfunction. In this note, we build a common framework for both the SDDP and a\ndiscrete time version of Zheng Qu's algorithm to solve deterministic multistage\noptimization problems. Our algorithm generates monotone approximations of the\nvalue functions as a pointwise supremum, or infimum, of basic (affine or\nquadratic for example) functions which are randomly selected.

Although dropout is widely used as a regularization technique for\nfully connected layers, it is often less effective for convolutional layers.\nThis lack of success of dropout for convolutional layers is perhaps due to the\nfact that activation units in convolutional layers are spatially correlated so\ninformation can still flow through convolutional networks despite dropout. Thus\na structured form of dropout is needed to regularize convolutional networks. In\nthis paper, we introduce DropBlock, a form of structured dropout, where units\nin a contiguous region of a feature map are dropped together.

For wind speeds\nof the order of the orbital speed, the shock is highly asymmetric compared to\nthe axisymmetric bow shock obtained for a purely planar homogeneous flow. With\nnet radiative cooling, the flow always circularizes for wind speeds low enough.\nAlthough the donor star does not fill its Roche lobe, the wind can be\nsignificantly beamed and bent by the orbital effects. The net angular momentum\nof the accreted flow is then sufficient to form a persistent disc-like\nstructure.

In this letter, we propose that the mass transfer in\nULX could be qualitatively the same as in Supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXB),\nwith a wind from the donor star highly beamed towards the compact object. Since\nthe star does not fill its Roche lobe, this mass transfer mechanism known as\n\"wind Roche lobe overflow\" can remain stable even for large mass ratios. Based\non realistic acceleration profiles derived from spectral observations and\nmodeling of the stellar wind, we compute the bulk motion of the wind to\nevaluate the fraction of the stellar mass outflow captured by the compact\nobject.

If this was also true when globular clusters (GCs) formed, then their\ncosmic density implies that most star formation before redshift ~2 made a GC\nthat lasted until today. Star-forming regions had to change after this time for\nthe modern universe to be making very few YMCs. Here we consider the conditions\nneeded for the formation of a ~10^6 Msun cluster. These include a star\nformation rate inside each independent region that exceeds ~1 Msun/yr to sample\nthe cluster mass function up to such a high mass, and a star formation rate per\nunit area of Sigma_SFR ~ 1 Msun/kpc^2/yr to get the required high gas surface\ndensity from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and therefore the required high\npressure from the weight of the gas. High pressures are implied by the virial\ntheorem at cluster densities. The ratio of these two quantities gives the area\nof a GC-forming region, ~1 kpc^2, and the young stellar mass converted to a\ncloud mass gives the typical gas surface density of 500-1000 Msun/pc^2\nObservations of star-forming clumps in young galaxies are consistent with these\nnumbers, suggesting they formed today's GCs. Observations of the cluster\ncut-off mass in local galaxies agree with the maximum mass calculated from\nSigma_SFR.

The embryos are\nembedded in a protoplanetary disk consisting of gas and pebbles and evolve in a\nregion where the disk structure supports convergent migration due to Type I\ntorques. As the embryos accrete pebbles, they become heated and thus affected\nby the thermal torque (Ben\\'{i}tez-Llambay et al. 2015) and the hot-trail\neffect (Chrenko et al. 2017) which excites orbital eccentricities. Motivated by\nfindings of Eklund & Masset (2017), we assume the hot-trail effect operates\nalso vertically and reduces the efficiency of inclination damping. Non-zero\ninclinations allow the embryos to become closely packed and also vertically\nstirred within the convergence zone. Subsequently, close encounters of two\nembryos assisted by the disk gravity can form transient binary planets which\nquickly dissolve. Binary planets with a longer lifetime $\\sim$$10^{4}$ yr form\nin 3-body interactions of a transient pair with one of the remaining embryos.\nThe separation of binary components generally decreases in subsequent\nencounters and due to pebble accretion until the binary merges, forming a giant\nplanet core. We provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the expected\noccurrence rate of binary planets, yielding one binary planet per\n$\\simeq$$2$--$5\\times10^{4}$ planetary systems. Therefore, although rare, the\nbinary planets may exist in exoplanetary systems and they should be\nsystematically searched for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 18:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

This state, which has been known to persist for\nyears, has recently been interpreted as emission from a shock that enshrouds\nthe pulsar. However, the pressure balance for such a configuration is a crucial\nunresolved issue. We consider two scenarios for pressure balance: a companion\nmagnetosphere and stellar mass loss with gas dominance. It is found that the\nmagnetospheric scenario requires several kilogauss poloidal fields for isobaric\nsurfaces to enshroud the MSP as well as for the magnetosphere to remain stable\nif there is significant mass loss. For the gas-dominated scenario, it is\nnecessary that the companion wind loses angular momentum prolifically as an\nadvection or heating-dominated flow. Thermal bremsstrahlung cooling in the flow\nmay be observable as a UV to soft X-ray component independent of orbital phase\nif the mass rate is high. We formulate the general requirements for shock\nstability against gravitational influences in the pulsar rotation-powered state\nfor the gas-dominated scenario.

First, potential misalignment or the\nexistence of irrelevant objects in the entire CXR images may cause unnecessary\nnoise and thus limit the network performance. Second, the relatively low image\nresolution caused by the resizing operation, which is a common preprocessing\nprocedure for training neural networks, may lead to the loss of image details,\nmaking it difficult to detect pathologies with small lesion regions. To address\nthese issues, we present a novel method termed as segmentation-based deep\nfusion network (SDFN), which leverages the domain knowledge and the\nhigherresolution information of local lung regions. Specifically, the local\nlung regions were identified and cropped by the Lung Region Generator (LRG).\nTwo CNN-based classification models were then used as feature extractors to\nobtain the discriminative features of the entire CXR images and the cropped\nlung region images. Lastly, the obtained features were fused by the feature\nfusion module for disease classification. Evaluated by the NIH benchmark split\non the Chest X-ray 14 Dataset, our experimental result demonstrated that the\ndeveloped method achieved more accurate disease classification compared with\nthe available approaches via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)\nanalyses.

The analysis and approximation\nof such problems is known to be non-standard as the line source causes the\nsolution to be singular. Our main result is a splitting theorem for the\nsolution; we show that the solution admits a split into an explicit, low\nregularity term capturing the singularity, and a high-regularity correction\nterm $w$ being the solution of a suitable elliptic equation. The splitting\ntheorem states the mathematical structure of the solution; in particular, we\nfind that the solution has anisotropic regularity. More precisely, the solution\nfails to belong to $H^1$ in the neighbourhood of $\\Lambda$, but exhibits\npiecewise $H^2$-regularity parallel to $\\Lambda$. The splitting theorem can\nfurther be used to formulate a numerical method in which the solution is\napproximated via its correction function $w$. This approach has several\nbenefits. Firstly, it recasts the problem as a 3D elliptic problem with a 3D\nright-hand side belonging to $L^2$, a problem for which the discretizations and\nsolvers are readily available. Secondly, it makes the numerical approximation\nindependent of the discretization of $\\Lambda$; thirdly, it improves the\napproximation properties of the numerical method. We consider here the Galerkin\nfinite element method, and show that the singularity subtraction then recovers\noptimal convergence rates on uniform meshes, i.e., without needing to refine\nthe mesh around each line segment. The numerical method presented in this paper\nis therefore well-suited for applications involving a large number of line\nsegments. We illustrate this by treating a dataset (consisting of $\\sim 3000$\nline segments) describing the vascular system of the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 19:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

In this paper,\na novel fast uplink grant scheduling method based on the theory of multi-armed\nbandits (MABs) is proposed. First, a single quality-of-service metric is\ndefined as a combination of the value of data packets, maximum tolerable access\ndelay, and data rate. Since full knowledge of these metrics for all machine\ntype devices (MTDs) cannot be known in advance at the base station (BS) and the\nset of active MTDs changes over time, the problem is modeled as a sleeping MAB\nwith stochastic availability and a stochastic reward function. In particular,\ngiven that, at each time step, the knowledge on the set of active MTDs is\nprobabilistic, a novel probabilistic sleeping MAB algorithm is proposed to\nmaximize the defined metric. Analysis of the regret is presented and the effect\nof the prediction error of the source traffic prediction algorithm on the\nperformance of the proposed sleeping MAB algorithm is investigated. Moreover,\nto enable fast uplink allocation for multiple MTDs at each time, a novel method\nis proposed based on the concept of best arms ordering in the MAB setting.\nSimulation results show that the proposed framework yields a three-fold\nreduction in latency compared to a random scheduling policy since it\nprioritises the scheduling of MTDs that have stricter latency requirements.\nMoreover, by properly balancing the exploration versus exploitation tradeoff,\nthe proposed algorithm can provide system fairness by allowing the most\nimportant MTDs to be scheduled more often while also allowing the less\nimportant MTDs to be selected enough times to ensure the accuracy of estimation\nof their importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 19:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

Though\nmany popular methods strive solely for depth quality, for real-time mobile\napplications (e.g. prosthetic glasses or micro-UAVs), speed and power\nefficiency are equally, if not more, important. Many real-world systems rely on\nSemi-Global Matching (SGM) to achieve a good accuracy vs. speed balance, but\npower efficiency is hard to achieve with conventional hardware, making the use\nof embedded devices such as FPGAs attractive for low-power applications.\nHowever, the full SGM algorithm is ill-suited to deployment on FPGAs, and so\nmost FPGA variants of it are partial, at the expense of accuracy.

In contrast, the\nthree BH spin measurements in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) show only values\nnear the maximum and likely have a different origin connected to the BH stellar\nprogenitor. We explore here two possible scenarios to explain the high spins of\nBHs in HMXBs: formation in binaries that undergo mass transfer (MT) during the\nmain sequence (MS; Case-A MT), and very close binaries undergoing chemically\nhomogeneous evolution (CHE). We find that both scenarios are able to produce\nhigh-spin BHs if internal angular momentum (AM) transport in the progenitor\nstar after its MS evolution is not too strong (i.e., weak coupling between the\nstellar core and its envelope). If instead efficient AM transport is assumed,\nwe find that the resulting BH spins are always too low with respect to\nobservations. The Case-A MT model provides a good fit for the BH spins, the\nmasses of the two components, and the final orbital periods for two of the\nthree BHs in HMXBs with measured spins. For one of them, the mass predicted for\nthe BH companion is significantly lower than observed, but this depends\nstrongly on the assumed efficiency of mass transfer. The CHE models predict\norbital periods that are too large for all three cases considered here. We\nexpect the Case-A MT to be much more frequent at the metallicities involved, so\nwe conclude that the Case-A MT scenario is preferred. Finally, we predict that\nthe stellar companions of HMXBs formed through the Case-A MT have enhanced\nnitrogen surface abundances, which can be tested by future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:47:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 13:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

In practice, however, these ratings are often highly inflated,\nand therefore not very informative. In this paper, we first investigate whether\nthe platform can obtain less inflated, more informative ratings by altering the\nmeaning and relative importance of the levels in the rating system. Second, we\nseek a principled approach for the platform to make these choices in the design\nof the rating system. First, we analyze the results of a randomized controlled\ntrial on an online labor market in which an additional question was added to\nthe feedback form. Between treatment conditions, we vary the question phrasing\nand answer choices; in particular, the treatment conditions include several\npositive-skewed verbal rating scales with descriptive phrases or adjectives\nproviding specific interpretation for each rating level. The online labor\nmarket test reveals that current inflationary norms can in fact be countered by\nre-anchoring the meaning of the levels of the rating system. In particular, the\npositive-skewed verbal rating scales yield rating distributions that\nsignificantly reduce rating inflation and are much more informative about\nseller quality. Second, we develop a model-based framework to compare and\nselect among rating system designs, and apply this framework to the data\nobtained from the online labor market test. Our simulations demonstrate that\nour model-based framework for scale design and optimization can identify the\nmost informative rating system and substantially improve the quality of\ninformation obtained over baseline designs. Overall, our study illustrates that\nrating systems that are informative in practice can be designed, and\ndemonstrates how to design them in a principled manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2018 23:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 16:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

While tomographic\nreconstruction for amorphous samples is straightforward, it is challenging to\nreconstruct samples with single-crystal domains because the attenuation of the\nsample varies as a function of its orientation with respect to the incident\nbeam due to Bragg scattering. In this paper, we present an algorithm that can\nreconstruct samples with single-crystal domains from WR neutron tomographic\nmeasurements. In particular, we use a model-based iterative reconstruction\n(MBIR) technique that reconstructs the volume by identifying and leaving out\nthe regions of the measurement that are affected by Bragg scatter. We combine\nthe output of the MBIR method with an algorithm that matches the reconstruction\nto the identified Bragg scatter to reconstruct a feature that corresponds to\nthe local crystallography of the sample being measured. Using simulated data,\nwe demonstrate how our algorithm can reconstruct materials with single-crystal\ndomains, thereby adding a powerful new capability for WR neutron imaging\ninstruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:56:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 16:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

The system we tackle is thus made of one exciton plus\nzero or one FS electron-hole pair. At low doping, the system ground state is\npredominantly made of a \"trion-hole\"---a trion (two opposite-spin electrons\nplus a valence hole) weakly bound to a FS hole---with a small exciton\ncomponent. As the trion is poorly coupled to photon, the intensity of the\nlowest absorption peak is weak; it increases with doping, thanks to the growing\nexciton component, due to a larger coupling between 2-particle and 4-particle\nstates. Under a further doping increase, the trion-hole complex is less bound\nbecause of Pauli blocking by FS electrons, and its energy increases. The lower\npeak then becomes predominantly due to an exciton dressed by FS electron-hole\npairs, that is, an exciton-polaron. As a result, the absorption spectra of\n$n$-doped semiconductor quantum wells show two prominent peaks, the nature of\nthe lowest peak turning from trion-hole to exciton-polaron under a doping\nincrease.

We consider a\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) SR and the symbol period for BD\ntransmission is designed to be either the same as or much longer than that of\nthe primary system, resulting in parasitic or commensal relationship between\nthe primary and BD transmissions. We first derive the achievable rates for the\nprimary system and the BD transmission.

Most existing work associates each\nproduct with a real-valued fixed mean utility and assumes a multinomial logit\nchoice (MNL) model. In many practical applications, feature/contexutal\ninformation of products is readily available. In this paper, we incorporate the\nfeature information by assuming a linear relationship between the mean utility\nand the feature. In addition, we allow the feature information of products to\nchange over time so that the underlying choice model can also be\nnon-stationary. To solve the dynamic assortment optimization under this\nchanging contextual MNL model, we need to simultaneously learn the underlying\nunknown coefficient and makes the decision on the assortment.

Given a workspace that is\ncharacterized by a set of polytopic obstacles, our objective is to compute the\nset of safe initial conditions such that a robot trajectory starting from these\ninitial conditions is guaranteed to avoid the obstacles. Our approach is to\nconstruct a finite state abstraction of the system and use standard\nreachability analysis over the finite state abstraction to compute the set of\nthe safe initial states. The first technical problem in computing the finite\nstate abstraction is to mathematically model the imaging function that maps the\nrobot position to the LiDAR image. To that end, we introduce the notion of\nimaging-adapted sets as partitions of the workspace in which the imaging\nfunction is guaranteed to be affine. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to\npartition the workspace into imaging-adapted sets along with computing the\ncorresponding affine imaging functions. Given this workspace partitioning, a\ndiscrete-time linear dynamics of the robot, and a pre-trained NN controller\nwith Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity, the second technical challenge\nis to analyze the behavior of the neural network. To that end, we utilize a\nSatisfiability Modulo Convex (SMC) encoding to enumerate all the possible\nsegments of different ReLUs. SMC solvers then use a Boolean satisfiability\nsolver and a convex programming solver and decompose the problem into smaller\nsubproblems. To accelerate this process, we develop a pre-processing algorithm\nthat could rapidly prune the space feasible ReLU segments. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms using numerical\nsimulations with increasing complexity of the neural network controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 02:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

Surface roughness generated by hierarchical\nstructures is a crucial property required for superhydrophobicity and\nself-cleaning. Here, we demonstrate a novel self-cleaning mechanism of textured\nsurfaces attributed to a spontaneous coalescence-induced wetting transition. We\nfocus on the wetting transition as it represents a new mechanism, which can\nexplain why droplets on rough surfaces are able to change from the highly\nadhesive Wenzel state to the low-adhesion Cassie-Baxter state and achieve\nself-cleaning. In particular, we perform many-body dissipative particle\ndynamics simulations of liquid droplets sitting on mechanically textured\nsubstrates. We quantitatively investigate the wetting behavior of an isolated\ndroplet as well as coalescence of droplets for both Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel\nstates. Our simulation results reveal that droplets in the Cassie-Baxter state\nhave much lower contact angle hysteresis and smaller hydrodynamic resistance\nthan droplets in the Wenzel state. When small neighboring droplets coalesce\ninto bigger ones on textured hydrophobic substrates, we observe a spontaneous\nwetting transition from a Wenzel state to a Cassie-Baxter state, which is\npowered by the surface energy released upon coalescence of the droplets. For\nsuperhydrophobic surfaces, the released surface energy may be sufficient to\ncause a jumping motion of droplets off the surface, in which case adding one\nmore droplet to coalescence may increase the jumping velocity by one order of\nmagnitude. When multiple droplets are involved, we find that the spatial\ndistribution of liquid components in the coalesced droplet can be controlled by\nproperly designing the overall arrangement of droplets and the distance between\nthem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 02:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

However,\nanomalies caused by technical issues confound these data, while the volume and\nvelocity of data prevent manual detection. We present a framework for automated\nanomaly detection in high-frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors,\nusing turbidity, conductivity and river level data. After identifying end-user\nneeds and defining anomalies, we ranked their importance and selected suitable\ndetection methods. High priority anomalies included sudden isolated spikes and\nlevel shifts, most of which were classified correctly by regression-based\nmethods such as autoregressive integrated moving average models. However, using\nother water-quality variables as covariates reduced performance due to complex\nrelationships among variables. Classification of drift and periods of\nanomalously low or high variability improved when we applied replaced anomalous\nmeasurements with forecasts, but this inflated false positive rates.\nFeature-based methods also performed well on high priority anomalies, but were\nalso less proficient at detecting lower priority anomalies, resulting in high\nfalse negative rates. Unlike regression-based methods, all feature-based\nmethods produced low false positive rates, but did not and require training or\noptimization. Rule-based methods successfully detected impossible values and\nmissing observations. Thus, we recommend using a combination of methods to\nimprove anomaly detection performance, whilst minimizing false detection rates.\nFurthermore, our framework emphasizes the importance of communication between\nend-users and analysts for optimal outcomes with respect to both detection\nperformance and end-user needs.

Much attention\nhas been given to the pre-flare magnetic topology to identify candidate sites\nof magnetic reconnection, yet it is unclear how the magnetic reconnection and\nits attendant topological changes shape the eruptive structure and how the\ntopology evolves during the eruption. Here we employed a realistic,\ndata-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation to study the evolving magnetic\ntopology for an X9.3 eruptive flare that occurred on 2017 September 6. The\nsimulation successfully reproduces the eruptive features and processes in\nunprecedented detail. The numerical results reveal that the pre-flare corona\ncontains multiple twisted flux systems with different connections, and during\nthe eruption, these twisted fluxes form a coherent flux rope through\ntether-cutting-like magnetic reconnection below the rope. Topological analysis\nshows that the rising flux rope is wrapped by a quasi-separatrix layer, which\nintersects itself below the rope, forming a topological structure known as\nhyperbolic flux tube, where a current sheet develops, triggering the\nreconnection. By mapping footpoints of the newly-reconnected field lines, we\nare able to reproduce both the spatial location and, for the first time, the\ntemporal separation of the observed flare ribbons, as well as the dynamic\nboundary of the flux rope's feet. Futhermore, the temporal profile of the total\nreconnection flux is comparable to the soft X-ray light curve.

Feasible sets of\nfeatures can be either descriptors (SIFT, HSV) for an entire image or the same\ndescriptor for different local parts (face, body). Ideally, the to-be-fused\nheterogeneous features are pre-assumed to be discriminative and complementary\nto each other. However, the effectiveness of different features varies\ndramatically according to different queries. That is to say, for some queries,\na feature may be neither discriminative nor complementary to existing ones,\nwhile for other queries, the feature suffices. As a result, it is important to\nestimate the effectiveness of features in a query-adaptive manner. To this end,\nthis article proposes a new late fusion scheme at the score level. We base our\nmethod on the observation that the sorted score curves contain patterns that\ndescribe their effectiveness. For example, an \"L\"-shaped curve indicates that\nthe feature is discriminative while a gradually descending curve suggests a bad\nfeature. As such, this paper introduces a query-adaptive late fusion pipeline.\nIn the hand-crafted version, it can be an unsupervised approach to tasks like\nparticular object retrieval. In the learning version, it can also be applied to\nsupervised tasks like person recognition and pedestrian retrieval, based on a\ntrainable neural module. Extensive experiments are conducted on two object\nretrieval datasets and one person recognition dataset. We show that our method\nis able to highlight the good features and suppress the bad ones, is resilient\nto distractor features, and achieves very competitive retrieval accuracy\ncompared with the state of the art. In an additional person re-identification\ndataset, the application scope and limitation of the proposed method are\nstudied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 04:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

In\nparticular, we embed infinitely many function weights (e.g. filters) on smooth,\nlow dimensional manifolds parameterized by compact B-splines, which are indexed\nby a position parameter. Instead of sampling from a categorical distribution to\npick a branch, samples choose a continuous position to pick a function weight.\nWe further show that by maximizing the mutual information between spline\npositions and class labels, the network can be optimally utilized and\nspecialized for classification tasks. Experiments show that our approach can\nsignificantly increase the accuracy of ResNets with negligible cost in speed,\nmatching the precision of a 110 level ResNet with a 32 level SplineNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 06:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

We have used mid-infrared data from the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue to search for the host galaxies of 65\nstrongly-scintillating MWA sources and compare their properties with those of\nthe overall population of bright low-frequency radio sources. We identified\nWISE mid-infrared counterparts for 91% of the bright sources in a single 900\nsquare degree MWA field, and found that the hosts of the strongly-scintillating\nsources were typically at least 1 mag fainter in the WISE W1 (3.4 micron) band\nthan the hosts of weakly-scintillating MWA sources of similar radio flux\ndensity.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of two\ntypical architectures for HDA MU-MIMO, i.e., the fully-connected (FC)\narchitecture where each RF antenna port is connected to all antenna elements of\nthe array, and the one-stream-per-subarray (OSPS) architecture where the RF\nantenna ports are connected to disjoint subarrays.

In this letter, we\ndescribe and demonstrate the physical origin of this asymmetry and support our\nexplanation by simulating the asymmetry with an end-to-end approach. From this\nwork, we found out that the observed asymmetry is explained by the interference\nbetween the AO-lag error and scintillation effects, mainly originating from the\nfast jet stream layer located at about 12 km in altitude. Now identified and\ninterpreted, this effect can be taken into account for further design of high\ncontrast imaging simulators, next generation or upgrade of high contrast\ninstruments, predictive control algorithms for adaptive optics or image\npost-processing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 09:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Many blockchain\nfeatures, such as byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), are indeed valuable\nadditions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the\ntechnology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are\nfundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with\ntraditional database systems, which have been around for decades already.\n  These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines\nbetween blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of\nthis is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under\ndevelopment by IBM. By having a relaxed view on BFT, the transaction pipeline\nof Fabric highly resembles the workflow of classical distributed databases\nsystems.\n  This raises two questions: (1) Which conceptual similarities and differences\ndo actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed\ndatabase system? (2) Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by\ntransitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus\nblurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle\nthese questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database\nresearch, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then\nsolve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to\nFabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our\nexperimental evaluation shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly\nincreases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by\nup to a factor of 3x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 09:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

Both paradigms generate a certain\ncommunication overhead and the question addressed in this paper is which of the\ntwo reduces the response time the most given that they use the same amount of\ncommunication overhead.\n  Prior work presented explicit bounds, for large scale systems, on when\nrandomized work sharing outperforms randomized work stealing in case of Poisson\narrivals and exponential job durations and indicated that work sharing is best\nwhen the load is below $\\phi -1 \\approx 0.6180$, with $\\phi$ being the golden\nratio.\n  In this paper we revisit this problem and study the impact of the job size\ndistribution using a mean field model.

The reason has\nbeen attributed to the fact that a substantial fraction of the molecules in the\ninteraction region will reside in excited vibrational states, which leads to a\ndepletion of the vibrational ground state. One type of molecule in which this\ncan take place is methane. A model for this phenomenon, based on $\\text{CH}_4$\nin trace concentrations in either $\\text{N}_2$ or dry air in a cylindrical gas\ncell, detected by mid-infrared light in the 1 - 100 Torr pressure range, is\npresented. Due to a fast collisional coupling between various rotational states\nand velocity groups we suggest that depletion in MAS can be modeled adequately\nby a simple three-level system to which the transport of molecules in the\nsystem is coupled as diffusion according to Fick's law, applied to each level\nindividually. The model is verified in a separate work [Hausmaninger T et al.,\nJ Quant Spectrosc Radiat Tr. 2017;205:59-70] with good agreement. It predicts\nthat depletion has a strong pressure dependence in the 1 - 30 Torr range, that\nit is significantly more pronounced in $\\text{N}_2$ than in air, and that\nconsiderable degrees of depletion can be obtained for mW powers of light (> 10%\nfor powers > 20 mW). The findings indicate that, unless precautions are taken,\ndepletion can adversely affect quantitative assessments performed by MAS. Means\nof how to reduce depletion are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 10:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

On pristine FLG we observe nicely ordered,\nthree-fold oriented rippled domains, with a 4.7+/-0.2 nm periodicity (small\nperiodicity, SP) and a peak-to-valley distance in the range 0.1-0.2 nm. Upon\nmild interaction of the FLG surface with the molecular solution, the ripple\nperiodicity relaxes to 6.2+/-0.2 nm (large periodicity, LP), while the\npeak-to-valley height increases to 0.2-0.3 nm. When additional energy is\ntransferred to the system through sonication in solution, graphene planes are\npeeled off from FLG, as shown by quantitative analysis of XPS and Raman\nspectroscopy data which indicate a neat reduction of thickness. Upon sonication\nrippled domains are no longer observed. Regarding HOPG, we could not observe\nripples on cleaved samples in ambient air, while LP ripples develop upon\ninteraction with the molecular solutions. Recent literature on similar systems\nis not univocal regarding the interpretation of rippling. The complex of our\ncomparative observations on FLG and HOPG can be hardly rationalized solely on\nthe base of surface assembly of molecules, either organic molecules coming from\nthe solution or adventitious species.

Being the most numerous and oldest stars in the galaxy, M dwarfs are\nobjects of great interest for exoplanet searches. The presence of molecules in\ntheir atmosphere complicates our understanding of their atmospheric properties.\nBut great advances have recently been made in the modeling of M dwarfs due to\nthe revision of solar abundances. Aims. We aim to determine stellar parameters\nof M dwarfs using high resolution spectra (R = 90 000) simultaneously in the\nvisible and the near-infrared. The high resolution spectra and broad wavelength\ncoverage provide an unique opportunity to understand the onset of dust and\ncloud formation at cool temperatures. Furthermore, this study will help in\nunderstanding the physical processes which occur in a cool atmospheres,\nparticularly, the redistribution of energy from the optical to the\nnear-infrared. Methods. The stellar parameters of M dwarfs in our sample have\nbeen determined by comparing the high resolution spectra both in the optical\nand in the near-infrared simultaneously observed by CARMENES with the synthetic\nspectra obtained from the BT-Settl model atmosphere. The detailed spectral\nsynthesis of these observed spectra both in the optical and in the\nnear-infrared helps to understand the missing continuum opacity. Results.

This\nunderstanding is reflected in classical mechanics, which posits that matter\nconsists of persistent, reidentifiable particles. However, the mathematical\nsymmetrization procedures used to describe identical particles within the\nquantum formalism have led to the widespread belief that identical quantum\nparticles lack either persistence or reidentifiability. However, it has proved\ndifficult to reconcile these assertions with the fact that identical particles\nare routinely assumed to be reidentifiable in particular circumstances.\n  Moreover, neither of these assertions accounts for the mathematical form of\nthe symmetrization procedures used to describe identical particles within the\nquantum framework, leaving open theoretical possibilities other than bosonic\nand fermionic behavior, such as paraparticles, which do not appear to be\nrealized in nature. Here we propose the novel idea that both persistence and\nnonpersistence models must be employed in order to fully account for the\nbehaviour of identical particles. Thus, identical particles are neither\npersistent nor nonpersistent. We prove the viability of this viewpoint by\nshowing how Feynman's and Dirac's symmetrization procedures arise through a\nsynthesis of a quantum treatment of these models, and by showing how\nreidentifiability emerges in a context-dependent manner. We further show that\nthe persistence and nonpersistence models satisfy the key characteristics of\nBohr's concept of complementarity, and thereby propose that the behavior of\nidentical particles is a manifestation of a persistence-nonpersistence\ncomplementarity, analogous to Bohr's wave-particle complementarity for\nindividual particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 12:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Currently,\nprogramming and reasoning about coinductive types is difficult for two reasons:\nThe need for recursive definitions to be productive, and the lack of\ncoincidence of the built-in identity types and the important notion of\nbisimilarity.\n  Guarded recursion in the sense of Nakano has recently been suggested as a\npossible approach to dealing with the problem of productivity, allowing this to\nbe encoded in types. Indeed, coinductive types can be encoded using a\ncombination of guarded recursion and universal quantification over clocks. This\npaper studies the notion of bisimilarity for guarded recursive types in Ticked\nCubical Type Theory, an extension of Cubical Type Theory with guarded\nrecursion. We prove that, for any functor, an abstract, category theoretic\nnotion of bisimilarity for the final guarded coalgebra is equivalent (in the\nsense of homotopy type theory) to path equality (the primitive notion of\nequality in cubical type theory). As a worked example we study a guarded notion\nof labelled transition systems, and show that, as a special case of the general\ntheorem, path equality coincides with an adaptation of the usual notion of\nbisimulation for processes. In particular, this implies that guarded recursion\ncan be used to give simple equational reasoning proofs of bisimilarity. This\nwork should be seen as a step towards obtaining bisimilarity as path equality\nfor coinductive types using the encodings mentioned above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 12:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

In this work, we examined the binding free energies of\nzoledronate (ZOL), risedronate (RIS), pamidronate (PAM), alendronate (ALN), and\nibandronate (IBN) to neat and protonated hydroxyapatite (HAP) surfaces\nincluding (001), (010), and (101) facets through molecular dynamics.

In general, surface protonation in general\nreduced the binding affinities of NBPs except protonated (010) surfaces.

Based on this representation, we\nidentify a well-known parametrization, for the first time without the use of\noperational calculus. This parametrization is a flat one, as the corresponding\nseries representations of the system variables converge. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss a formal differential parametrization where the free time function\nallows a physical interpretation as the bending moment at the unactuated\nboundary. Even though the corresponding series do not converge, a numerical\nsimulation using a least term summation illustrates the usefulness of this\nformal differential parametrization for the motion planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 13:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-28"}

Both probe complementary aspects of the single-particle\nexcitation spectrum. Taken together, ARPES and STM have the potential to\nexplore properties of the electronic Green's function, a central object of\nmany-body theory. This review explicates this potential with a focus on\nheavy-electron quantum criticality, especially the role of Kondo destruction. A\ndiscussion on how to probe the Kondo destruction effect across the\nquantum-critical point using ARPES and STM measurements is presented.\nParticular emphasis is placed on the question of how to distinguish between the\nsignatures of the initial onset of hybridization-gap formation, which is the\n\"high-energy\" physics to be expected in all heavy-electron systems, and those\nof Kondo destruction, which characterizes the low-energy physics and, hence,\nthe nature of quantum criticality.

To identify single units (SUs), potential spikes\nare detected and separated with respect to their potential neuronal origins\n('spike sorting'). However, different sorting algorithms yield inconsistent\nunit assignments which seriously influences the subsequent analyses of the\nspiking activity. To evaluate the quality of spike sortings performed with\ndifferent prevalent algorithms offered by the 'Plexon Offline Sorter' we first\napply these algorithms to experimental data (ED), namely recordings in the\nSubthalamic Nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease, obtained during Deep\nBrain Stimulation surgery. Since this procedure leaves us unsure about the best\nsorting result we then apply all methods again to artificial data (AD) with\nknown ground truth (GT). AD consists of pairs of SUs with different shape\nsimilarity embedded in the background noise of the ED. The sorting evaluation\nis based on the influence of the respective methods on the SU assignments and\nits effect on the resulting firing characteristics. We find a high variability\nin the sorting results obtained by different algorithms that increases with SU\nshape similarity. We also find significant differences in the resulting firing\ncharacteristics of the ED. We conclude that Valley-Seeking produces the most\naccurate results if the exclusion of artifacts as unsorted events is important.\nIf the latter is less important ('clean' data) K-Means is a better option. Our\nresults strongly argue for the need of standardized validation procedures for\nspike sorting based on GT data. The recipe suggested here is simple enough to\nbecome a standard procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 14:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

Magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) is time demanding but can provide images that are considered gold\nstandard for diagnosis. Automated stroke lesion segmentation can provide with\nan estimate of the location and volume of the lesioned tissue, which can help\nin the clinical practice to better assess and evaluate the risks of each\ntreatment. We propose a deep learning methodology for acute and sub-acute\nstroke lesion segmentation using multimodal MR imaging. The proposed method is\nevaluated using two public datasets from the 2015 Ischemic Stroke Lesion\nSegmentation challenge (ISLES 2015). These involve the tasks of sub-acute\nstroke lesion segmentation (SISS) and acute stroke penumbra estimation (SPES)\nfrom diffusion, perfusion and anatomical MRI modalities. The performance is\ncompared against state-of-the-art methods with a blind online testing set\nevaluation on each of the challenges.

When compared\nwith the rest of submitted strategies, we achieve top rank performance with a\nlower Hausdorff distance. Better segmentation results are obtained by\nleveraging the anatomy and pathophysiology of acute stroke lesions and using a\ncombined approach to minimize the effects of class imbalance.

Varying the flow speed can give rise to a range of dynamics\nincluding limit cycle behaviour and chaotic motion of the cantilevered sheet.\nRecently, the \"inverted flag\" configuration - a cantilevered elastic sheet\naligned with the flow impinging on its free edge - has been observed to produce\nlarge-amplitude flapping over a finite band of flow speeds. This flapping\nphenomenon has been found to be a vortex-induced vibration, and only occurs at\nsufficiently large Reynolds numbers. In all cases studied, the inverted flag\nhas been formed from a cantilevered sheet of rectangular morphology, i.e. the\nplanform of its elastic sheet is a rectangle. Here, we investigate the effect\nof the inverted flag's morphology on its resulting stability and dynamics. We\nchoose a trapezoidal planform which is explored using experiment and an\nanalytical theory for the divergence instability of an inverted flag of\narbitrary morphology. Strikingly, for this planform we observe that the flow\nspeed range over which flapping occurs scales approximately with the flow speed\nat which the divergence instability occurs. This provides a means by which to\npredict and control flapping. In a biological setting, leaves in a wind can\nalso align themselves in an inverted flag configuration. Motivated by this\nnatural occurrence we also study the effect of adding an artificial \"petiole\"\n(a thin elastic stalk that connects the sheet to the clamp) on the inverted\nflag's dynamics. We find that the petiole serves to partially decouple fluid\nforces from elastic forces and increases the freedom by which the flapping\ndynamics can be tuned. These results highlight the intricacies of the flapping\ninstability and account for some of the varied dynamics of leaves in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 14:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

This problem has broad applications in fields such as\nsonars, seismol-ogy, ultrasounds or room acoustics. It belongs to the broader\nclass of blind channel identification problems, which have been intensively\nstudied in signal processing. Existing methods in the literature proceed in two\nsteps: (i) blind estimation of sparse discrete-time filters and (ii) echo\ninformation retrieval by peak-picking on filters. The precision of these\nmethods is fundamentally limited by the rate at which the signals are sampled:\nestimated echo locations are necessary on-grid, and since true locations never\nmatch the sampling grid, the weight estimation precision is impacted. This is\nthe so-called basis-mismatch problem in compressed sensing. We propose a\nradically different approach to the problem, building on the framework of\nfinite-rate-of-innovation sampling. The approach operates directly in the\nparameter-space of echo locations and weights, and enables near-exact blind and\noff-grid echo retrieval from discrete-time measurements. It is shown to\noutperform conventional methods by several orders of magnitude in precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 15:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

However, in magnetic materials the optical transitions are usually\ncharacterized by spectrally broad resonances with widths considerably exceeding\nthe Zeeman splitting in the magnetic field. Here we investigate experimentally\nand theoretically the TMOKE in the vicinity of relatively narrow optical\nresonances provided by confined quantum systems. For experimental demonstration\nwe use the exciton resonance in a (Cd,Mn)Te diluted magnetic semiconductor\nquantum well, where the strong exchange interaction with magnetic ions enables\nthe giant Zeeman splitting of exciton spin states $\\Delta$ in magnetic fields\nof a few Tesla. In the weak coupling regime, when the splitting $\\Delta$ is\nsmaller than the spectral broadening of the optical transitions $\\Gamma$, the\nTMOKE magnitude grows linearly with the increase of the Zeeman splitting and\nits spectrum has an S-shape, which remains virtually unchanged in this range.\nIn the strong coupling regime ($\\Delta>\\Gamma$) the TMOKE magnitude saturates,\nwhile its spectrum is strongly modified resulting in the appearance of two\nseparate peaks. The TMOKE is sensitive not only to the sample surface but can\nbe used to probe the confined electronic states in depth if the upper layer is\nsufficiently transparent. Our results demonstrate that TMOKE of spectrally\nnarrow resonances serves as a versatile tool for probing the charge and spin\nstructure of electronic states in various confined quantum systems and can be\nused for spin tomography in combination with the conventional polar Kerr\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 15:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

Assessing the\nquantitative impact of heat excess is difficult, because all decisive processes\nrelated to charge transport and emission via charge recombination are thermally\nactivated. For example, electric currents that are elevated due to larger\ntemperatures cause additional Joule heating and increase, hence, the device\ntemperature even further. Here we establish how parameters responsible for heat\ntransport, i.e., the thermal conductivity of the organic layers and the heat\ntransfer coefficient between the device surface and the environment govern the\ntemperature inside the OLED. We establish, relying on three-dimensional\ndrift-diffusion simulations that self-consistently couple thermally-activated\ncharge transport and heat transport, that the thermal conductivity of organic\nlayers is not a bottleneck for heat transport, because the encountered layer\nthicknesses in realistic device geometries prevent heat accumulation. The heat\ntransfer to the ambient environment is the key parameter to dissipate excess\nheat from the device. Intentionally elevated operating temperatures, that may\nimprove the OLEDs electric performance, are not necessarily beneficial, as any\nincrease in operating temperature decreases the device stability. The thermal\neffects being decisive for the OLED temperature occur in device layers beyond\nthe electrically active region. We propose analytical expressions that relate\nthe temperature in the device for a given point of operation to the heat\ntransfer to the environment and the substrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 15:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The\nflow has been extensively studied since early 90's as the magneto-rotational\ninstability (MRI) occurring in the flow could possibly explain the origin of\nthe instability observed in certain astrophysical objects. Elsewhere the ideal\napproximation has been used to study high-speed flows, whilst it sometimes\nproduces paradoxical results. For example, ideal flows must be completely\nstabilised for strong enough applied magnetic field, but on the other hand the\nvanishing magnetic Prandtl number limit of the stability should be purely\nhydrodynamic so instability must occur when Rayleigh's stability condition is\nviolated. The first our discovery is that this apparent contradiction can be\nresolved by showing the abrupt appearance of the hydrodynamic instability at\ncertain critical value of magnetic Prandtl number, which can be found by\nasymptotically large Reynolds number limit but with long enough wavelength to\nretain some diffusive effects. The second our finding concerns so-called\nVelikhov-Chandrasekhar paradox, namely the mismatch of the zero external\nmagnetic field limit of the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar stability criterion and\nRayleigh's stability criterion. We show for fully wide gap cases that the high\nReynolds number asymptotic analysis of the MRI naturally yields the simple\nstability condition that describes smooth transition from Rayleigh to\nVelikhov-Chandrasekhar stability criteria with increasing Lundquist number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 01:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Therefore,\nin this paper, we aim to design a controlled-release drug delivery system with\na mobile drug carrier that minimizes the total amount of released drugs while\nensuring a desired rate of drug absorption during a prescribed time period. We\nmodel the mobile drug carrier as a mobile transmitter, the targeted diseased\ncells as an absorbing receiver, and the channel between the transceivers as a\ntime-variant channel since the carrier mobility results in a time-variant\nabsorption rate of the drug molecules. Based on this, we develop a molecular\ncommunication (MC) framework to design the controlled-release drug delivery\nsystem. In particular, we develop new analytical expressions for the mean,\nvariance, probability density function, and cumulative distribution function of\nthe channel impulse response (CIR). Equipped with the statistical analysis of\nthe CIR, we design and evaluate the performance of the controlled-release drug\ndelivery system.

Many algorithms have been developed to estimate\na neuron's mapping function from an ensemble of stimulus-response pairs.

One solution to protect privacy in healthcare is the use of\nblockchain technology. However, one of the primary problems with blockchain is\nits highly limited scalability.

However, forward searching for the target design becomes\nprohibitive when the target is itself moving or only partially understood. To\naddress this bottleneck, we propose to use backward prediction by leveraging\nthe rich data generated during earlier exploration and construct a machine\nlearning framework to predict the design parameters for any target in a single\nstep.

However, the SCH can be used as an\nalternative to transmit high priority safety messages in the event that they\nare invoked during the service channel interval (SCHI). This implies that there\nis a need to transmit safety messages across multiple available utilized\nchannels to ensure that all vehicles receive the safety message. Transmission\nacross multiple SCH's using the legacy IEEE 1609.4 requires multiple channel\nswitching and therefore introduces further end-to-end delays. Given that safety\nmessaging is a life critical application, it is important that optimal\nend-to-end delay performance is derived in multi-channel VANET scenarios to\nensure reliable safety message dissemination. To tackle this challenge, three\nprimary contributions are in this article: first, a channel coordinator\nselection approach based on the least average separation distance (LAD) to the\nvehicles that expect to tune to other SCH's and operates during the control\nchannel interval (CCHI) is proposed. Second, a model to determine the optimal\ntime intervals in which CMD operates during the CCHI is proposed.
