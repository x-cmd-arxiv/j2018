Materials and Methods: We retrospectively collected a dataset of\n5978 fundus images and their glaucoma severities were annotated by the\nconsensus of two experienced ophthalmologists. We preprocessed the images to\ngenerate global and local regions of interest (ROIs), namely the global\nfield-of-view images and the local disc region images. We then divided the\ngenerated images into three independent sub-groups for training, validation,\nand testing purposes. With the datasets, eight convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) (i.e., VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, DenseNet, InceptionV3, InceptionResNet,\nXception, and NASNetMobile) were trained separately to grade glaucoma severity,\nand validated quantitatively using the area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic (ROC) curve and the quadratic kappa score. Results: The CNNs,\nexcept VGG16 and VGG19, achieved average kappa scores of 80.36% and 78.22% when\ntrained from scratch on global and local ROIs, and 85.29% and 82.72% when\nfine-tuned using the pre-trained weights, respectively.

The method assumes the object is mostly\nrigid and treats the motion of object's imprint on sensor surface as a 2D\nrigid-body motion. We use the deviation of the true motion field from that of a\n2D planar rigid transformation as a measure of slip.

In\nsuccessful models of such complex behaviour, its origin lies within\nnon-convexity of the governing free energy functional. A common approach to\nsolve such non-convex problems numerically is by regularisation through a\nviscous formulation. This, however, may require the system to be overdamped and\nhence potentially has a strong impact on the obtained results. To avoid this\nside-effect, this paper addresses the treatment of the full non-convexity by an\nappropriate numerical solution algorithm -- the truncated Newton method. The\npresented method is a double iterative approach which successively generates\nquadratic approximations of the energy landscape and minimises these by an\ninner iterative scheme, based on the conjugate gradient method. The inner\niterations are terminated when either a sufficient energy decrease is achieved\nor, to incorporate the treatment of non-convexity, a direction of negative\ncurvature is encountered. If the latter never happens, the method reduces to\nNewton--Raphson iterations, solved by the conjugate gradient method, with a\nsubsequent line search. However, in the case of a non-convex energy it avoids\nconvergence to a saddle point and adds robustness. The stability of the\ntruncated Newton method is demonstrated for the, highly non-convex,\nPeierls-Nabarro model, solved within a Finite Element framework. A potential\ndrop in efficiency due to an occasional near singular Hessian is remedied by a\ntrust region like extension, which is physically based on the Peierls-Nabarro\ndisregistry profile. The result is an efficient numerical scheme with a high\nstability that is independent of any regularisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 16:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

Under a row sum condition on the coupling matrix,\nexistence of a unique SOPS for the corresponding scalar DDE implies existence\nof a unique synchronous SOPS for the coupled DDEs. However, stability of the\nSOPS for the scalar DDE does not generally imply stability of the synchronous\nSOPS for the coupled DDEs.

However, it is often\ndifficult to quantify the extent of selection bias, and sensitivity analysis\ncan be challenging to undertake and to understand. In this article we\ndemonstrate that the magnitude of the bias due to selection can be bounded by\nsimple expressions defined by parameters characterizing the relationships\nbetween unmeasured factor(s) responsible for the bias and the measured\nvariables. No functional form assumptions are necessary about those unmeasured\nfactors.

The Gaia Collaboration has used Gaia-DR2 sources with\nsix-dimensional (6D) phase space information to derive kinematical maps within\n5 kpc of the Sun, which is a reachable range for stars with relative error in\ndistance lower than 20%.\n  AIMS. Here we aim to extend the range of distances by a factor of two to\nthree, thus adding the range of Galactocentric distances between 13 kpc and 20\nkpc to the previous maps, with their corresponding error and root mean square\nvalues.\n  METHODS. We make use of the whole sample of stars of Gaia-DR2 including\nradial velocity measurements, which consists in more than seven million\nsources, and we apply a statistical deconvolution of the parallax errors based\non the Lucy's inversion method of the Fredholm integral equations of the first\nkind, without assuming any prior.\n  RESULTS. The new extended maps provide lots of new and corroborated\ninformation about the disk kinematics: significant departures of circularity in\nthe mean orbits with radial Galactocentric velocities between -20 and +20 km/s\nand vertical velocities between -10 and +10 km/s; variations of the azimuthal\nvelocity with position; asymmetries between the northern and the southern\nGalactic hemispheres, especially towards the anticenter that includes a larger\nazimuthal velocity in the south; and others.\n  CONCLUSIONS.

Tracking drifters in large-scale geophysical flows can involve\nuncertainty in drifter location, complex inertial effects, and other factors\nwhich make comparing them to simulated Lagrangian trajectories from numerical\nmodels extremely challenging. Temporal and spatial discretization, factors\nnecessary in modeling large scale flows, also contribute to separation between\nreal and simulated drifter trajectories. The chaotic advection inherent in\nthese turbulent flows tends to separate even closely spaced tracer particles,\nmaking error metrics based solely on drifter displacements unsuitable for\nestimating model parameters. We propose to instead use error in the coherent\nstructure coloring (CSC) field to assess model skill. The CSC field provides a\nspatial representation of the underlying coherent patterns in the flow, and we\nshow that it is a more robust metric for assessing model accuracy.

Because the CSC field enhances\nthe difference in error between correct and incorrect model parameters, error\nminima in model parameter sweeps become more distinct.

Thus the new algorithm\nmainly consists of two loops, each for performing one step on a group of\nblocks. Notably, it does not contain any data race conditions at all, ideal for\na direct loop level parallelization using multiple threads. A systematic\nperformance study is carried out for several point source problems with various\nspeed functions on four grids with up to $1024^3$ points using two different\ncomputers. Substantial parallel speedups, e.g., up to 3--5 times the number of\ncores on a 16-core/32-thread computer and up to two orders of magnitude on a\n64-core/256-thread computer, are demonstrated with all cases. As an extra\nbonus, our new algorithm also gives improved sequential performance in most\nscenarios.

In this paper, we develop an\nunderstanding of inflationary correlators which parallels that of flat-space\nscattering amplitudes. Specifically, we study slow-roll inflation with weak\ncouplings to extra massive particles, for which all correlators are controlled\nby an approximate conformal symmetry on the boundary of the spacetime. After\nclassifying all possible contact terms in de Sitter space, we derive an\nanalytic expression for the four-point function of conformally coupled scalars\nmediated by the tree-level exchange of massive scalars. Conformal symmetry\nimplies that the correlator satisfies a pair of differential equations with\nrespect to spatial momenta, encoding bulk time evolution in purely boundary\nterms. The absence of unphysical singularities completely fixes this\ncorrelator. A spin-raising operator relates it to the correlators associated\nwith the exchange of particles with spin, while weight-shifting operators map\nit to the four-point function of massless scalars. We explain how these de\nSitter four-point functions can be perturbed to obtain inflationary three-point\nfunctions.

Content selection, for example, may greedily\nselect the most important facts, which may require, however, too many words to\nexpress, and this may be undesirable when space is limited or expensive.\nSelecting other facts, possibly only slightly less important, may allow the\nlexicalization stage to use much fewer words, or to report more facts in the\nsame space. Decisions made during content selection and lexicalization may also\nlead to more or fewer sentence aggregation opportunities, affecting the length\nand readability of the resulting texts. Building upon on a publicly available\nstate of the art natural language generator for Semantic Web ontologies, this\narticle presents an Integer Linear Programming model that, unlike pipeline\narchitectures, jointly considers choices available in content selection,\nlexicalization, and sentence aggregation to avoid greedy local decisions and\nproduce more compact texts, i.e., texts that report more facts per word.\nCompact texts are desirable, for example, when generating advertisements to be\nincluded in Web search results, or when summarizing structured information in\nlimited space. An extended version of the proposed model also considers a\nlimited form of referring expression generation and avoids redundant sentences.\nAn approximation of the two models can be used when longer texts need to be\ngenerated. Experiments with three ontologies confirm that the proposed models\nlead to more compact texts, compared to pipeline systems, with no deterioration\nor with improvements in the perceived quality of the generated texts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 18:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

After deployment on an embedded\nedge device, GE will be subject to customized, user-specific data (e.g., accent\nin speech) and its performance may suffer. This problem may be alleviated by\ntraining a local DNN (the local expert, LE) on a small size customized training\ndata to correct the errors made by GE. A gating network then will be trained to\ndetermine whether an incoming data should be handled by GE or LE. Since the\ncustomized dataset is in general very small, the cost of training LE and GN\nwould be much lower than that of re-training of GE. The training of LE and GN\nthus can be performed at local device, properly protecting the privacy of\ncustomized training data. In this work, we developed a prototype MOE\narchitecture for handwritten alphanumeric character recognition task. We use\nEMNIST as the generic dataset, LeNet5 as GE, and handwritings of 10 users as\nthe customized dataset. We show that with the LE and GN, the classification\naccuracy is significantly enhanced over the customized dataset with almost no\ndegradation of accuracy over the generic dataset. In terms of energy and\nnetwork size, the overhead of LE and GN is around 2.5% compared to those of GE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 18:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

The SGH RD\nscheme is based on the staggered finite element discretizations as in [Dobrev\net al., SISC, 2012]. However, the advantage of the residual formulation over\nclassical FEM approaches consists in the natural mass matrix diagonalization\nwhich allows one to avoid the solution of the linear system with the global\nsparse mass matrix while retaining the desired order of accuracy. This is\nachieved by using Bernstein polynomials as finite element shape functions and\ncoupling the space discretization with the deferred correction type\ntimestepping method. Moreover, it can be shown that for the Lagrangian\nformulation written in non-conservative form, our residual distribution scheme\nensures the exact conservation of the mass, momentum and total energy. In this\npaper we also discuss construction of numerical viscosity approximations for\nthe SGH RD scheme allowing to reduce the dissipation of the numerical solution.\nThanks to the generic formulation of the staggered grid residual distribution\nscheme, it can be directly applied to both single- and multimaterial and\nmultiphase models.

To address this challenge, efficient\ncollection of data is critical to prevent overburdening the communication\nsystems and overreaching computational and memory capacity. In this work, we\npropose an efficient data collection scheme that selects and transmits only a\nsmall subset of data to alleviate data transmission burden. As a demonstration,\nwe have used the proposed approach to select data points to be transmitted from\n10,000 connected vehicles trips available in the Safety Pilot Model Deployment\ndataset. The presented results show that collection ratio can be as small as\n0.05 depending on the required precision. Moreover, a simulation study was\nperformed to evaluate the travel time estimation accuracy using the proposed\ndata collection approach. Results show that the proposed data collection\napproach can significantly improve travel time estimation accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 19:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

In this article, we compare the\nstructural properties of protein cores and jammed packings of amino acid-shaped\nparticles in much greater depth by measuring their local and connected void\nregions. We find that the distributions of surface Voronoi cell volumes and\nlocal porosities obey similar statistics in both systems.

However, current heart monitoring devices suffer from two important\ndrawbacks: i) failure in capturing inter-patient variability, and ii)\nincapability of identifying heart abnormalities ahead of time to take effective\npreventive and therapeutic interventions.\n  This paper proposed a novel predictive signal processing method to solve\nthese issues. We propose a two-step classification framework for ECG signals,\nwhere a global classifier recognizes severe abnormalities by comparing the\nsignal against a universal reference model. The seemingly normal signals are\nthen passed through a personalized classifier, to recognize mild but\ninformative signal morphology distortions. The key idea is to develop a novel\ndeviation analysis based on a controlled nonlinear transformation to capture\nsignificant deviations of the signal towards any of predefined abnormality\nclasses. Here, we embrace the proven but overlooked fact that certain features\nof ECG signals reflect underlying cardiac abnormalities before the occurrences\nof cardiac disease. The proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of\n96.6% and provides a unique feature of predictive analysis by providing\nwarnings before critical heart conditions. In particular, the chance of\nobserving a severe problem (a red alarm) is raised by about 5% to 10% after\nobserving a yellow alarm of the same type. Although we used this methodology to\nprovide early precaution messages to elderly and high-risk heart-patients, the\nproposed method is general and applicable to similar bio-medical signal\nprocessing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 19:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

The persistence\nrelates to the range of data-resolution scales over which a clustering solution\npersists; it is quantified in terms of the maximum over two-norms of all the\nassociated cluster-covariance matrices. Thus we associate a persistence value\nfor each element in a set of clustering solutions with different number of\nclusters.

In this paper, we develop stochastic stability\nconditions for affine jump-diffusions, thereby providing the needed\nlarge-sample theoretical support for estimating such processes. We establish\nergodicity for such models by imposing a `strong mean reversion' condition and\na mild condition on the distribution of the jumps, i.e. the finiteness of a\nlogarithmic moment. Exponential ergodicity holds if the jumps have a finite\nmoment of a positive order. In addition, we prove strong laws of large numbers\nand functional central limit theorems for additive functionals for this class\nof models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 21:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

However, for\nparallel iterative belief propagation (BP) decoders, CRC is only used as an\nearly stopping criterion with incremental error-correction performance\nimprovement. In this paper, we first propose a CRC-polar BP (CPBP) decoder by\nexchanging the extrinsic information between the factor graph of the polar code\nand that of the CRC.

However, existing recommendation engines\nforce raters with heterogeneous behavior profiles to map their intrinsic rating\nscales to a common rating scale (e.g. 1-5). This non-linear transformation of\nthe rating scale shatters the low-rank structure of the rating matrix,\ntherefore resulting in a poor fit and consequentially, poor recommendations. In\nthis paper, we propose Clustered Monotone Transforms for Rating Factorization\n(CMTRF), a novel approach to perform regression up to unknown monotonic\ntransforms over unknown population segments. Essentially, for recommendation\nsystems, the technique searches for monotonic transformations of the rating\nscales resulting in a better fit. This is combined with an underlying matrix\nfactorization regression model that couples the user-wise ratings to exploit\nshared low dimensional structure. The rating scale transformations can be\ngenerated for each user, for a cluster of users, or for all the users at once,\nforming the basis of three simple and efficient algorithms proposed in this\npaper, all of which alternate between transformation of the rating scales and\nmatrix factorization regression.

First, we advocate that the two nonets form the flavor nonet\napproximately satisfying the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass relation. Then we reexamine\nthe mass ordering generated from the tetraquark nonets and show that this mass\nordering is satisfied by the two nonets although the ordering in the heavy\nnonet is marginal. The marginal mass ordering however can be regarded as\nanother signature for tetraquarks because it can be explained partially by the\nhyperfine masses calculated from the tetraquark mixing framework. The\ntetraquark mixing parameters are found to be independent of isospins giving\nadditional support for the formation of the flavor nonets. In addition, we\ndiscuss the other approaches like two-quark pictures or meson-meson bound\nstates, and their possible limitations in explaining the two nonets. As a\npeculiar signature distinguished from other approaches, we investigate the\nfall-apart coupling strengths into two vector mesons from our tetraquarks.\nCoupling strengths into the two-vector modes are found to enhance strongly in\nthe heavy nonet while they are suppressed in the light nonet. The coupling\nratios, which depend on the isospin channel, are found to be huge around $\\sim\n15$. This trend in the two-vector modes, which is opposite to that in the\ntwo-pseudoscalar fall-apart modes, can provide another testing ground for the\ntetraquark mixing framework.

Presumably for\nthe same reasons, they often characterize the rate-limiting step in\nsimulations.

Most prior works consider the case where the\nuncertainty on transitions related to different states is uncoupled and the\nadversary is allowed to select the worst possible realization for each state\nunrelated to others, potentially leading to highly conservative solutions. On\nthe other hand, the case of general uncertainty sets is known to be\nintractable. We consider a factor model for probability transitions where the\ntransition probability is a linear function of a factor matrix that is\nuncertain and belongs to a factor matrix uncertainty set. This is a fairly\ngeneral model of uncertainty in probability transitions, allowing the decision\nmaker to model dependence between probability transitions across different\nstates and it is significantly less conservative than prior approaches. We show\nthat under an underlying rectangularity assumption, we can efficiently compute\nan optimal robust policy under the factor matrix uncertainty model.\nFurthermore, we show that there is an optimal robust policy that is\ndeterministic, which is of interest from an interpretability standpoint. We\nalso introduce the robust counterpart of important structural results of\nclassical MDPs, including the maximum principle and Blackwell optimality, and\nwe provide a computational study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in mitigating the conservativeness of robust policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 04:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 00:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 02:14:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 01:09:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 01:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 20:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 21:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 16:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

There are several\ncriteria available to measure the level of competence of base classifiers, such\nas local accuracy estimates and ranking. However, using only one criterion may\nlead to a poor estimation of the classifier's competence. In order to deal with\nthis issue, we have proposed a novel dynamic ensemble selection framework using\nmeta-learning, called META-DES. An important aspect of the META-DES framework\nis that multiple criteria can be embedded in the system encoded as different\nsets of meta-features. However, some DES criteria are not suitable for every\nclassification problem. For instance, local accuracy estimates may produce poor\nresults when there is a high degree of overlap between the classes. Moreover, a\nhigher classification accuracy can be obtained if the performance of the\nmeta-classifier is optimized for the corresponding data. In this paper, we\npropose a novel version of the META-DES framework based on the formal\ndefinition of the Oracle, called META-DES.Oracle. The Oracle is an abstract\nmethod that represents an ideal classifier selection scheme. A meta-feature\nselection scheme using an overfitting cautious Binary Particle Swarm\nOptimization (BPSO) is proposed for improving the performance of the\nmeta-classifier. The difference between the outputs obtained by the\nmeta-classifier and those presented by the Oracle is minimized. Thus, the\nmeta-classifier is expected to obtain results that are similar to the Oracle.\nExperiments carried out using 30 classification problems demonstrate that the\noptimization procedure based on the Oracle definition leads to a significant\nimprovement in classification accuracy when compared to previous versions of\nthe META-DES framework and other state-of-the-art DES techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 04:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

Despite tremendous progress in\nprimary biometric traits (e.g., face and fingerprint) based person\nidentification, a single biometric trait alone cannot meet the desired\nrecognition accuracy in forensic scenarios. Tattoos, as one of the important\nsoft biometric traits, have been found to be valuable for assisting in person\nidentification. However, tattoo search in a large collection of unconstrained\nimages remains a difficult problem, and existing tattoo search methods mainly\nfocus on matching cropped tattoos, which is different from real application\nscenarios. To close the gap, we propose an efficient tattoo search approach\nthat is able to learn tattoo detection and compact representation jointly in a\nsingle convolutional neural network (CNN) via multi-task learning. While the\nfeatures in the backbone network are shared by both tattoo detection and\ncompact representation learning, individual latent layers of each sub-network\noptimize the shared features toward the detection and feature learning tasks,\nrespectively. We resolve the small batch size issue inside the joint tattoo\ndetection and compact representation learning network via random image stitch\nand preceding feature buffering.

Deeply rooted in algebraic topology,\npersistent homology (PH) provides a delicate balance between data\nsimplification and intrinsic structure characterization, and has been applied\nto various areas successfully. However, the combination of PH and machine\nlearning has been hindered greatly by three challenges, namely topological\nrepresentation of data, PH-based distance measurements or metrics, and PH-based\nfeature representation. With the development of topological data analysis,\nprogresses have been made on all these three problems, but widely scattered in\ndifferent literatures. In this paper, we provide a systematical review of PH\nand PH-based supervised and unsupervised models from a computational\nperspective. Our emphasizes are the recent development of mathematical models\nand tools, including PH softwares and PH-based functions, feature\nrepresentations, kernels, and similarity models. Essentially, this paper can\nwork as a roadmap for the practical application of PH-based machine learning\ntools. Further, we consider different topological feature representations in\ndifferent machine learning models, and investigate their impacts on the protein\nsecondary structure classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 06:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

Recently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has become a popular choice to\nmodel individual dynamic for single-person action recognition due to its\nability of capturing the temporal motion information in a range. However,\nexisting RNN models focus only on capturing the dynamics of human interaction\nby simply combining all dynamics of individuals or modeling them as a whole.\nSuch models neglect the inter-related dynamics of how human interactions change\nover time. To this end, we propose a novel Hierarchical Long Short-Term\nConcurrent Memory (H-LSTCM) to model the long-term inter-related dynamics among\na group of persons for recognizing the human interactions. Specifically, we\nfirst feed each person's static features into a Single-Person LSTM to learn the\nsingle-person dynamic. Subsequently, the outputs of all Single-Person LSTM\nunits are fed into a novel Concurrent LSTM (Co-LSTM) unit, which mainly\nconsists of multiple sub-memory units, a new cell gate and a new co-memory\ncell. In a Co-LSTM unit, each sub-memory unit stores individual motion\ninformation, while this Co-LSTM unit selectively integrates and stores\ninter-related motion information between multiple interacting persons from\nmultiple sub-memory units via the cell gate and co-memory cell, respectively.\nExtensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed H-LSTCM by comparing against baseline and state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 07:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

It is a pre-germination treatment that partially hydrates the seed and\nallows controlled imbibition. This stimulates and induces initial germination\nprocess, but prevents radicle emergence. Consequently, treated seeds are\nfortified with enhanced germination characteristics, improved physiological\nparameters, uniformity in growth, and improved capability to cope up with\ndifferent biotic and abiotic stresses. Existing techniques for evaluating the\neffectiveness of seed priming suffer from several drawbacks, including very\nhigh operating time, indirect and destructive analysis, bulky experimental\narrangement, high cost, and require extensive analytical expertise. To\ncircumvent these drawbacks, we propose a biospeckle based technique to analyse\nthe effects of different priming treatments on germination characteristics of\nseeds. The study employs non-primed (T0) and priming treatments (T1-T75),\nincluding hydropriming and chemical priming (using three chemical agents namely\nsodium chloride, potassium nitrate, and urea) for different time durations and\nsolution concentrations. The results conclusively establish biospeckle analysis\nas an efficient active tool for seed priming analysis.

Owing to superior photocorrosion resistance,\nnontoxicity and suitable band edge positions, TiO$_2$ is considered to be the\nmost efficient photocatalyst for facilitating redox reactions. However, due to\nthe absence of adequate understanding of the mechanism of adsorption, the\nCO$_2$ conversion efficiency on TiO$_2$ surfaces has not been maximized. While\nanatase TiO$_2$ (101) is the most stable facet, the (001) surface is more\nreactive and it has been experimentally shown that the stability can be\nreversed and a larger percentage (up to ~ 89%) of the (001) facet can be\nsynthesized in the presence fluorine ions. Therefore, through density\nfunctional calculations we have investigated the CO$_2$ adsorption on TiO$_2$\n(001) surface. We have developed a three-state quantum-mechanical model that\nexplains the mechanism of chemisorption, leading to the formation of a\ntridentate carbonate complex. The electronic structure analysis reveals that\nthe CO$_2$-TiO$_2$ interaction at the surface is uniaxial and long ranged,\nwhich gives rise to anisotropy in binding energy (BE). It negates the widely\nperceived one-to-one correspondence between coverage and BE and infers that the\nspatial distribution of CO$_2$ primarily determines the BE.

However, most deep CNN based SR models\nattempt to improve distortion measures (e.g. PSNR, SSIM, IFC, VIF) while\nresulting in poor quantified perceptual quality (e.g. human opinion score,\nno-reference quality measures such as NIQE). Few works have attempted to\nimprove the perceptual quality at the cost of performance reduction in\ndistortion measures. A very recent study has revealed that distortion and\nperceptual quality are at odds with each other and there is always a trade-off\nbetween the two. Often the restoration algorithms that are superior in terms of\nperceptual quality, are inferior in terms of distortion measures. Our work\nattempts to analyze the trade-off between distortion and perceptual quality for\nthe problem of single image SR. To this end, we use the well-known SR\narchitecture-enhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) network and show that it can\nbe adapted to achieve better perceptual quality for a specific range of the\ndistortion measure.

However, not all of them lie\nin orbits that remain stable over the age of the Solar System. Unstable zones\nallow some Trojans to escape in time scales shorter than the Solar System age.\nThis may contribute to populate other small body populations. In this paper, we\nstudy this process by performing long-term numerical simulations of the\nobserved Trojans, focusing on the trajectories of those that leave the\nresonance. The orbits of current Trojans are taken as initial conditions and\ntheir evolution is followed under the gravitational action of the Sun and the\nplanets. We find the rate of escape of Trojans from L5, ~1.1 times greater than\nfrom L4. The majority of escaped Trojans have encounters with Jupiter although\nthey have encounters with the other planets too. Almost all escaped Trojans\nreach the comet zone, ~90% cross the Centaur zone and only L4 Trojans reach the\ntransneptunian zone.

The contribution of the escaped Trojans to other minor\nbody populations would be negligible, being the contribution from L4 and L5 to\nJFCs and no-JFCs almost the same, and the L4 contribution to Centaurs and TNOs,\norders of magnitude greater than that of L5. Considering the collisional\nremoval, besides the dynamical one, and assuming that Trojans that escape due\nto collisions follow the same dynamical behavior that the ones removed by\ndynamics, we would have a minor contribution of Trojans to comets and Centaurs.\nHowever, there would be some specific regions were escaped Trojans could be\nimportant such as ACOs, Encke-type comets, S-L 9-type impacts on Jupiter and\nNEOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 13:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

At\neach stage of the game they simultaneously bid some part of their current\nfortune and the probability of winning or loosing depends on their bids. In\nmany models of the red-and-black game it is assumed that the win probability is\na function of the quotient of the bid of the first player and the sum of both\nbids. In the literature some additional properties, like concavity or\nsuper-multiplicativity are assumed in order to ensure that bold and timid\nstrategy is the Nash equilibrium. Our aim is to provide a generalization in\nwhich the probability of winning is a two-variable function which depends on\nboth bids. We introduce two new functional inequalities whose solutions lead to\nwin probability functions for which a Nash equilibrium is realized by the\nbold-timid strategy. Since both inequalities have not easy intuitive meanings,\nwe discuss them in a separate section of the paper and we give there some\nillustrating examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 13:20:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 10:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 13:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 11:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

To this end, we derive an\nexact expression for the Landau parameters within the dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT) approximation to the single-band Hubbard model. At the Mott\ntransition the symmetric and the anti-symmetric Landau parameter diverge. The\nvanishing compressibility at the Mott transition directly implies the\ndivergence of the forward scattering amplitude in the charge sector, which\nconnects the proximity of the Mott phase to a tendency towards phase\nseparation. We verify the expected behavior of the Landau parameters in a DMFT\napplication to the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice at finite\ntemperature. Exact conservation laws and the Ward identity are crucial to\ncapture vertex divergences related to the Mott transition. We furthermore\ngeneralize Leggett's formula for the static susceptibility of the Fermi liquid\nto the static fermion-boson response function. In the charge sector the limits\nof small transferred momentum and frequency of this response function commute\nat the Mott transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 13:22:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 09:41:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 10:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 15:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

Exact analytic designs and solutions are known in the 2D\ncase, where they have been obtained using Fourier transform on $SE(2)$. Here we\nextend these approaches to 3D using Fourier transform on the Lie group $SE(3)$\nof rigid body motions. More precisely, we define the homogeneous space of 3D\npositions and orientations $\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\rtimes S^{2}:=SE(3)/(\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}\n\\times SO(2))$ as the quotient in $SE(3)$. In our construction, two group\nelements are equivalent if they are equal up to a rotation around the reference\naxis. On this quotient we design a specific Fourier transform. We apply this\nFourier transform to derive new exact solutions to Fokker-Planck PDEs of\n$\\alpha$-stable L\\'{e}vy processes on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\rtimes S^{2}$. This\nreduces classical analysis computations and provides an explicit algebraic\nspectral decomposition of the solutions. We compare the exact probability\nkernel for $\\alpha = 1$ (the diffusion kernel) to the kernel for\n$\\alpha=\\frac12$ (the Poisson kernel). We set up SDEs for the L\\'{e}vy\nprocesses on the quotient and derive corresponding Monte-Carlo methods.

Just as complex ordered systems exist in restricted\ndimensions in 2D and 1D, owing to the dimensionality of the order parameter,\nquaternion ordered systems in 4D and 3D exist in restricted dimensions. Just\nbelow the melting temperature, misorientational fluctuations in the form of\nspontaneously generated topological defects prevent the development of the\nsolid state. Such solidifying systems are well-described using O(4) quantum\nrotor models, and a defect-driven Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\ntransition is anticipated to separate an undercooled fluid from a crystalline\nsolid state. In restricted dimensions, in addition to orientationally-ordered\nground states, orientationally-disordered ground states may be realized by\ntuning a non-thermal parameter in the relevant O(n) quantum rotor model\nHamiltonian; thus, glassy solid states are anticipated to exist as distinct\nground states of O(4) quantum rotor models.

Usually, they are evaluated by some well-known objective\nmetrics, e.g., PSNR and SSIM, but these indices cannot provide suitable results\nin accordance with the perception of human being. Recently, a more reasonable\nperception measurement has been proposed in [1], which is also adopted by the\nPIRM-SR 2018 challenge. In this paper, motivated by [1], we aim to generate a\nhigh-quality SR result which balances between the two indices, i.e., the\nperception index and root-mean-square error (RMSE). To do so, we design a new\ndeep SR framework, dubbed Bi-GANs-ST, by integrating two complementary\ngenerative adversarial networks (GAN) branches. One is memory residual SRGAN\n(MR-SRGAN), which emphasizes on improving the objective performance, such as\nreducing the RMSE. The other is weight perception SRGAN (WP-SRGAN), which\nobtains the result that favors better subjective perception via a two-stage\nadversarial training mechanism. Then, to produce final result with excellent\nperception scores and RMSE, we use soft-thresholding method to merge the\nresults generated by the two GANs.

To better handle these\nuncertainties during treatment, the authors propose a dynamic framework for\nrobust adaptive radiation therapy in which a variety of robust adaptive\ntreatment strategies are introduced and evaluated. This variety is a result of\noptimization variables with various degrees of freedom within robust\noptimization models that vary in their grade of conservativeness. We formulate\nan adaptive framework with dependence on time and/or uncertainty or neither.\nThe framework is evaluated with either expected-value-, worst-case-, or\nconditional-value-at-risk-(CVaR)-optimization. The goal of this study is to\nidentify the mathematical properties of the proposed robust adaptive strategies\nin order to restore the planned dose distribution. We apply a result from\nconvex analysis to show that in our framework, the time-dependent problem has a\ntime-independent optimal solution. This implies that the time-dependent problem\ncan be solved by dynamically solving the corresponding time-independent\nproblem. This is especially relevant in a clinical context, since it implies\nthat adaptive radiation therapy can be implemented in clinical practice using\ncommercially available treatment planning systems. We demonstrate that\ntime-and-scenario-dependent variables are most compatible with\nworst-case-optimization and that including dose prediction potentially improves\ntreatment compared to non-adaptive planning. Contrarily,\ntime-and-scenario-independent variables appear most compatible with\nexpected-value-optimization. Non-adaptive robust strategies may provide\nsufficient target coverage, comparable to robust adaptive strategies, if the\noccurring uncertainties follow the same distribution as those included in the\nrobust model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 14:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-16"}

To this end, a two-dimensional microstructural specimen subjected\nto simple shear is considered, consisting of a central soft phase flanked by\ntwo hard-phase regions. A hexagonal atomic structure with equal lattice spacing\nis adopted, the interactions of which are described by the Lennard--Jones\npotential with phase specific depths of its energy well. During loading, edge\ndislocation dipoles centred in the soft phase are introduced, which progress\ntowards the phase boundaries, where they pile up. Under a sufficiently high\nexternal shear load, the leading dislocation is eventually transmitted into the\nharder phase. The homogenized PN-FE model is calibrated to an atomistic model\nin terms of effective elasticity constants and glide plane properties as\nobtained from simple uniform deformations. To study the influence of different\nformulations of the glide plane potential, multiple approaches are employed,\nranging from a simple sinusoidal function of the tangential disregistry to a\ncomplex model that couples the influence of the tangential and the normal\ndisregistries. The obtained results show that, qualitatively, the dislocation\nstructure, displacement, strain fields, and the dislocation evolution are\ncaptured adequately. The simplifications of the PN-FE model lead, however, to\nsome discrepancies within the dislocation core. Such discrepancies play a\ndominant role in the dislocation transmission process, which thus cannot\nquantitatively be captured properly. Despite its simplicity, the PN-FE model\nproves to be an elegant tool for a qualitative study of edge dislocation\nbehaviour in two-phase microstructures, although it may not be quantitatively\npredictive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 14:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 07:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Achieving\nfast data rates over wireless links thus comes at the cost of reliability in\nthe form of high packet error rates compared to wired links due to channel\nnoise and interference. However, the effect of the communication link errors on\nthe control system performance depends dynamically on the control system state.\nWe propose a novel control-communication co-design approach to the low-latency\nresource allocation problem.

The study of disordered alloy and interacting electrons\nsystems based on single electron motion is an old challenge and an important\nproblem in condensed matter physics. In this paper we introduce a real space\napproximation beyond super cell approximation for the study of these systems to\ncapture multi-site effects. Average disordered alloy or interacting system is\nreplaced by a self-energy, $\\Sigma(i,j,E)$. We divided self-energy in q-space\n$\\Sigma({\\bf q}; E)=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{ij}e^{i{\\bf q}.{\\bf r}_{ij}}\\Sigma(i,j;\nE)$ into two parts $\\Sigma({\\bf q}; E)=\\frac{1}{N_{c}}\\sum_{IJ\\in\\; \\mbox{\\tiny\nsame cluster}}e^{i{\\bf q}.{\\bf r}_{IJ}}\\Sigma(I,J; E)+\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{ij\\notin\n\\:\\mbox{\\tiny same cluster}}e^{i{\\bf q}.{\\bf r}_{IJ}}\\Sigma(I,J,E)$ where\n$\\{Lc_{1}, Lc_{2},Lc_{3}\\}$ are dimensions of the super cell.

Then we kept this correction in the second step to add self\nenergies of sites in different super cells which leads to fully q-dependent\nself energy in the first Brillouin zone (FBZ). Our self-energy in FBZ is\ncasual, fully q-dependent, and continuous with respect to ${\\bf q}$. It\nrecovers coherent potential approximation in the single site approximation and\nis exact when the number of sites in the super cell approaches to the total\nnumber of lattice sites. We illustrate that this approximation undertakes\nelectrons localization for one and two dimensional alloy systems which isn't\nobserved by previous multi site approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 15:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

The primary\ngoal is to generate plausible caricatures with reasonable exaggerations given\nface images. Conventional caricature generation approaches mainly use low-level\ngeometric transformations such as image warping to generate exaggerated images,\nwhich lack richness and diversity in terms of content and style. The recent\nprogress in generative adversarial networks (GANs) makes it possible to learn\nan image-to-image transformation from data, so that richer contents and styles\ncan be generated. However, directly applying the GAN-based models to this task\nleads to unsatisfactory results because there is a large variance in the\ncaricature distribution. Moreover, some models require strictly paired training\ndata which largely limits their usage scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nCariGAN overcome these problems. Instead of training on paired data, CariGAN\nlearns transformations only from weakly paired images. Specifically, to enforce\nreasonable exaggeration and facial deformation, facial landmarks are adopted as\nan additional condition to constrain the generated image. Furthermore, an\nattention mechanism is introduced to encourage our model to focus on the key\nfacial parts so that more vivid details in these regions can be generated.\nFinally, a Diversity Loss is proposed to encourage the model to produce diverse\nresults to help alleviate the `mode collapse' problem of the conventional\nGAN-based models. Extensive experiments on a new large-scale `WebCaricature'\ndataset show that the proposed CariGAN can generate more plausible caricatures\nwith larger diversity compared with the state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 15:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 21:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

Applied to bird observational data from the citizen science\nproject eBird, we demonstrate how SCN quantifies the data distribution shift\nand outperforms supervised learning models that do not address the data bias.\nCompared with competing models in the context of covariate shift, we further\ndemonstrate the advantage of SCN in both its effectiveness and its capability\nof handling massive high-dimensional data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 15:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 21:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 17:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 05:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

In this paper we fill this gap to show its\napplication for solving the null control problem for the Stokes system. To\nachieve this goal, we introduce two radial basis function solvers, one global\nand the other local, to discretized the primal and adjoint systems related to\nthe control problem. Both techniques are based on divergence free global RBFs.\nStability analysis for these methods is performed in terms of the spectral\nradius of the corresponding Gram matrices. By using a conjugate gradient\nalgorithm, adapted to the radial basis function setting, the control problem is\nsolved. Several test problems in two dimensions are numerically solved by these\nRBFs methods to test their feasibility.

This mismatch degrades the performance of speaker\nverification, especially when the durations of training and testing utterances\nare very different. To alleviate this issue, we propose the deep segment\nattentive embedding method to learn the unified speaker embeddings for\nutterances of variable duration.

Instead of\nonly using one local segment, we use the whole utterance to learn the\nutterance-level embedding by applying an attentive pooling to the embeddings of\nall segments.

The resonance frequency of the sound\nabsorber can be easily adjusted just by changing the mass or thickness of the\ncavity. A very large ratio between wavelength and material thickness is\nmeasured for a manufactured perfect absorber (ratio = 201) . It is shown that\nthis high sub-wavelength ratio is associated with narrowband effects and that\nthe increase in the sub-wavelength ratio is limited by the damping in the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 10:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The incident wave is decomposed into\nplane waves and each plane wave is reflected off the surface using the standard\nFresnel formalism. For each plane wave the reflected wave is assumed to be\nlocally a plane wave. This is a very reasonable assumption and there are no\nuncontrolled approximations in our treatment of the reflection phenomenon. The\nsurface roughness effects are also included by using a simple model. We apply\nour formalism to the radiation produced by the balloon-borne HiCal\nradio-frequency (RF) transmitter.

The\ncomplicated spatial dependencies of roadway links and the dynamic temporal\npatterns of traffic states make it particularly challenging. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a new capsule network (CapsNet) to extract the spatial\nfeatures of traffic networks and utilize a nested LSTM (NLSTM) structure to\ncapture the hierarchical temporal dependencies in traffic sequence data. A\nframework for network-level traffic forecasting is also proposed by\nsequentially connecting CapsNet and NLSTM. On the basis of literature review,\nour study is the first to adopt CapsNet and NLSTM in the field of traffic\nforecasting. An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links\nshows that the proposed framework with the capability of capturing complicated\nspatiotemporal traffic patterns outperforms multiple state-of-the-art traffic\nforecasting baseline models. The superiority and feasibility of CapsNet and\nNLSTM are also demonstrated, respectively, by visualizing and quantitatively\nevaluating the experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 01:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

We ask the\nquestion of whether there is a procedure, computable by hand, which can\ncalculate the appropriate premium tax credit for any household with\nself-employment income. We give an example showing that IRS tax guidance, which\nhas had self-employed taxpayers use an iterative fixed point procedure to\ncalculate their premium tax credits since 2014, can lead to a divergent\nsequence of iterates. As a consequence, IRS guidance does not calculate\nappropriate premium tax credits for tax returns in certain income intervals,\nadversely affecting eligible beneficiaries. A bisection procedure for\ncalculating premium tax credits is proposed. We prove that this procedure\ncalculates appropriate premium tax credits for a model of simple tax returns;\nand apparently, this procedure has already been used to prepare accepted tax\nreturns. We outline the problem of finding a procedure which calculates\nappropriate premium tax credits for models of general tax returns. While the\nbisection procedure will work with the tax code in its current configuration,\nit could fail, in states which have not expanded Medicaid, if a certain\ndeduction were to revert to an earlier form. Future policy objectives might\nalso lead to further problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 23:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

We establish a novel Markov chain model to\ncharacterize all the state transitions of public and private chains. The\nminimum requirement of Hashrate together with the minimum delay of being\nprofitable is derived in close-form. The former reduces to 21.48% with the\nsymmetric selfish miners, while their competition with asymmetric Hashrates\nputs forward a higher requirement of the profitable threshold. The profitable\ndelay increases with the decrease of the Hashrate of selfish miners, making the\nmining pools more cautious on performing selfish mining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 07:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

The tutorial is devoted mostly to a charge-based (i.e.\nelectric controlled) implementation using transition metal oxides materials,\nwhich exhibit unique properties that emulate key functionalities needed for\nthis application. In the Introduction, we compare the main differences between\na conventional computational machine, based on the Turing-von Neumann paradigm,\nto a Neuromorphic machine, which tries to emulate important functionalities of\na biological brain. We also describe the main electrical properties of\nbiological systems, which would be useful to implement in a charge-based\nsystem. In Chapter II, we describe the main components of a possible\nsolid-state implementation. In Chapter III, we describe a variety of Resistive\nSwitching phenomena, which may serve as the functional basis for the\nimplementation of key devices for Neuromorphic computing. In Chapter IV we\ndescribe why transition metal oxides, are promising materials for future\nNeuromorphic machines. Theoretical models describing different resistive\nswitching mechanisms are discussed in Chapter V while existing implementations\nare described in Chapter VI. Chapter VII presents applications to practical\nproblems. We list in Chapter VIII important basic research challenges and open\nissues. We discuss issues related to specific implementations, novel materials,\ndevices and phenomena. The development of reliable, fault tolerant, energy\nefficient devices, their scaling and integration into a Neuromorphic computer\nmay bring us closer to the development of a machine that rivals the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 18:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Thus, various of sparse channel estimation algorithms produce sparse\nchannel estimation errors which can be utilized to narrow down the perturbation\nregion of imperfect CSI. We investigate a $l_1$-norm bounded channel\nuncertainty model for the robust beamforming problems, which captures the\nsparse nature of channel errors.
