It is foreseen to be built\nand operated in three stages, with a centre-of-mass energy ranging from a few\nhundred GeV up to 3 TeV. The main beam-induced background impacting CLIC\nphysics analyses is produced by beamstrahlung radiation from the electron and\npositron bunches traversing the high field of the opposite beam and converting\nto hadrons. The timing selections are a powerful tool to discriminate signal\nfrom background events at CLIC. For each CLIC stage, three sets of selections,\nLoose, Selected, and Tight, are defined to allow the analysis of different\nsignal topologies. The selections are defined depending on the particle type\nand the reconstructed polar angle of each particle flow object reconstructed\nusing the particle flow analysis. As a first step, the performance of the\ntiming selections currently defined for the CLIC 380 GeV energy stage are\nevaluated using a $t\\overline{t}$ sample decaying mainly into light quarks as\nsignal and $\\gamma\\gamma\\to$hadron events as background. As a result, after\napplying the selections the level of background is significantly reduced, down\nto few GeV, while the shift of the signal peak to lower energy is kept within a\nfew percent. The cuts in the Loose selection are then relaxed to search for\npossible improvements: in one of the options considered, the signal component\nis partially recovered but also the background energy mean remains unchanged\nwith respect to not applying any cuts. In conclusion, no change is foreseen on\nthe timing selections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 16:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

We make the following three\ncontributions: first, a Generic Matching Network (GMN) architecture that can\npotentially count any object in a class-agnostic manner; second, by\nreformulating the counting problem as one of matching objects, we can take\nadvantage of the abundance of video data labeled for tracking, which contains\nnatural repetitions suitable for training a counting model. Such data enables\nus to train the GMN. Third, to customize the GMN to different user\nrequirements, an adapter module is used to specialize the model with minimal\neffort, i.e. using a few labeled examples, and adapting only a small fraction\nof the trained parameters. This is a form of few-shot learning, which is\npractical for domains where labels are limited due to requiring expert\nknowledge (e.g. microbiology).

When the actual metric of interest is 0-1 loss, it is common\nto minimize the average surrogate loss for some well-behaved (e.g. convex)\nsurrogate. Recently, several other aggregate losses such as the maximal loss\nand average top-$k$ loss were proposed as alternative objectives to address\nshortcomings of the average loss. However, we identify common classification\nsettings, e.g. the data is imbalanced, has too many easy or ambiguous examples,\netc., when average, maximal and average top-$k$ all suffer from suboptimal\ndecision boundaries, even on an infinitely large training set.

The\nspeed of Type I migration is proportional to the mass of a protoplanet, while\nthe final decade of growth of a pebble-accreting planetary core takes place at\na rate that scales with the mass to the two-thirds power. This results in\nplanetary growth tracks (i.e., the evolution of a protoplanet's mass versus its\ndistance from the star) that become increasingly horizontal\n(migration-dominated) with rising mass of the protoplanet. It has been shown\nrecently that the migration torque on a protoplanet is reduced proportional to\nthe relative height of the gas gap carved by the growing planet. Here we show\nfrom 1-D simulations of planet-disc interaction that the mass at which a planet\ncarves a 50% gap is approximately 2.3 times the pebble isolation mass. Our\nmeasurements of the pebble isolation mass from 1-D simulations match published\n3-D results relatively well, except at very low viscosities where the 3-D\npebble isolation mass is significantly higher, possibly due to gap edge\ninstabilities not captured in 1-D. The pebble isolation mass demarks the\ntransition from pebble accretion to gas accretion. Gas accretion to form\ngas-giant planets therefore takes place over a few astronomical units of\nmigration after reaching first the pebble isolation mass and, shortly after,\nthe 50% gap mass. Our results demonstrate how planetary growth can outperform\nmigration, both during core accretion and during gas accretion, even when the\nStokes number of the pebbles is small, St~0.01, and the pebble-to-gas flux\nratio in the protoplanetary disc is in the nominal range of 0.01-0.02. We find\nthat planetary growth is very rapid in the first million years of the\nprotoplanetary disc and that the probability for forming gas-giant planets\nincreases with the initial size of the protoplanetary disc and with decreasing\nturbulent diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 17:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 13:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

To address how gyrase copes\nwith these topological challenges, we used high-speed single-molecule\nfluorescence imaging in live Escherichia coli cells. We demonstrate that at\nleast 300 gyrase molecules are stably bound to the chromosome at any time, with\n~12 enzymes enriched near each replication fork.

Dwell\ntimes of ~2 s were observed for the dispersed gyrase molecules, which we\npropose maintain steady-state levels of negative supercoiling of the\nchromosome.

Lett. 95, 166601 (2005)), by solving\nan Anderson impurity model parametrized by density functional theory (DFT++).\nOur results suggest that the orbital responsible for the Kondo effect is\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ for the tetracarbonyl, and its combination with $d_{z^2}$ for the\ndicarbonyl. The molecular structures depend considerably on the approximate\nexchange--correlation functional, which may be related to the known difficulty\nof describing CO binding to metal surfaces. These structural variations\nstrongly affect the Kondo properties, which is not only a concern for\npredictive studies, but also of interest for detecting mechanical deformations\nand for understanding the effect of tip--adsorbate interactions in the scanning\ntunneling microscope. Still, by constraining the tetracarbonyl to $C_{4v}$\nsymmetry, as suggested by experimental data, we find structures compatible with\nthe experimental trend for $T_K$ (employing BLYP-D3+U). This is not possible\nfor the tricarbonyl despite the range of computational parameters scanned. For\nthe tetra- and dicarbonyl, the increased $T_K$ correlates with a larger\nhybridization function at the Fermi level, which we trace back to an increased\ninteraction of the Co $3d$ orbitals with the ligands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 18:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Using photonic-integration techniques, functional devices\nwith low noise, small size, low-power consumption, scalable fabrication, and\nheterogeneous combinations of photonics and electronics can be realized. Kerr\nsolitons, which stably circulate in a Kerr microresonator, have emerged as a\nsource of coherent, ultrafast pulse trains and ultra-broadband\noptical-frequency combs. Using the f-2f technique, Kerr combs support\ncarrier-envelope-offset phase stabilization for optical synthesis and\nmetrology.

The clockwork presented here is based on a\nsilicon-nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) microresonator that supports an optical-frequency\ncomb composed of soliton pulses at 1 THz repetition rate. By electro-optic\nphase modulation of the entire Si$_3$N$_4$ comb, we arbitrarily generate\nadditional CW modes between the Si$_3$N$_4$ comb modes; operationally, this\nreduces the pulse train repetition frequency and can be used to implement OFD\nto the microwave domain. Our experiments characterize the residual frequency\nnoise of this Kerr-microresonator clockwork to one part in $10^{17}$, which\nopens the possibility of using Kerr combs with high performance optical clocks.\nIn addition, the photonic integration and 1 THz resolution of the Si$_3$N$_4$\nfrequency comb makes it appealing for broadband, low-resolution liquid-phase\nabsorption spectroscopy, which we demonstrate with near infrared measurements\nof water, lipids, and organic solvents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 18:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

The\nsemi-structured nature of host logs inhibits automated analytics, and while\nmanual analysis is common, the sheer volume makes manual inspection of all logs\nimpossible. Although many powerful algorithms for analyzing time-series and\nsequential data exist, utilization of such algorithms for most cyber security\napplications is either infeasible or requires tailored, research-intensive\npreparations. In particular, basic mathematic and algorithmic developments for\nproviding a generalized, meaningful similarity metric on system logs is needed\nto bridge the gap between many existing sequential data mining methods and this\ncurrently available but under-utilized data source. In this paper, we provide a\nrigorous definition of a metric product space on Windows Event Logs, providing\nan embedding that allows for the application of established machine learning\nand time-series analysis methods. We then demonstrate the utility and\nflexibility of this embedding with multiple use-cases on real data: (1)\ncomparing known infected to new host log streams for attack detection and\nforensics, (2) collapsing similar streams of logs into semantically-meaningful\ngroups (by user, by role), thereby reducing the quantity of data but not the\ncontent, (3) clustering logs as well as short sequences of logs to identify and\nvisualize user behaviors and background processes over time. Overall, we\nprovide a metric space framework for general host logs and log sequences that\nrespects semantic similarity and facilitates a wide variety of data science\nanalytics to these logs without data-specific preparations for each.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 19:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

Determining the type of brain\ntumor has significant impact on the treatment choice and patient's survival.\nHuman-centered diagnosis is typically error-prone and unreliable resulting in a\nrecent surge of interest to automatize this process using convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs).

The main contribution is to\nequip CapsNet with access to the tumor surrounding tissues, without distracting\nit from the main target.

In this context, dynamic Dataflow and Gamma - General\nAbstract Model for Multiset mAnipulation) - emerge as interesting computational\nmodels choices. In the dynamic Dataflow model, operations are performed as soon\nas their associated operators are available, without rely on a Program Counter\nto dictate the execution order of instructions. The Gamma paradigm is based on\na parallel multiset rewriting scheme. It provides a non-deterministic execution\nmodel inspired by an abstract chemical machine metaphor, where operations are\nformulated as reactions that occur freely among matching elements belonging to\nthe multiset. In this work, equivalence relations between the dynamic Dataflow\nand Gamma paradigms are exposed and explored, while methods to convert from\nDataflow to Gamma paradigm and vice versa are provided. It is shown that\nvertices and edges of a dynamic Dataflow graph can correspond, respectively, to\nreactions and multiset elements in the Gamma paradigm. Implementation aspects\nof execution environments that could be mutually beneficial to both models are\nalso discussed. This work provides the scientific community with the\npossibility of taking profit of both parallel programming models, contributing\nwith a versatility component to researchers and developers. Finally, it is\nimportant to state that, to the best of our knowledge, the similarity relations\nbetween both dynamic Dataflow and Gamma models presented here have not been\nreported in any previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 19:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

As such, quantum\ngeneral covariance bears on the ability to consistently switch between the\ndescriptions of the same physics relative to arbitrary choices of quantum\nreference system. Recently, a systematic approach for such switches has been\ndeveloped (arXiv:1809.00556, 1809.05093, 1810.04153). It links the descriptions\nrelative to different choices of quantum reference system, identified as the\ncorrespondingly reduced quantum theories, via the reference-system-neutral\nDirac quantization, in analogy to coordinate changes on a manifold. In this\nwork, we apply this method to a simple cosmological model to demonstrate how to\nconsistently switch between different internal time choices in quantum\ncosmology.

For the\nfirst time, in connection with the Nyquist-Shannon theorem we determine the\n$N$-dependence of this discreteness-driven relaxation, deriving a typical\nrelaxation time $T/\\tau_{cr}\\approx 0.1 N^{1/6}$, with slightly weaker\n$N$-dependencies for non-integrable potentials with substantial fractions of\nchaotic orbits. This timescale is much smaller than the collisional timescale\neven for small-$N$ systems such as open clusters and represents an upper limit\nfor real collisionless $N$-body systems.

Recently such questions have received much attention in the\nsetting of mixed graphs, i.e. networks that admit both undirected \\emph{edges}\nand directed \\emph{arcs}. The degree/diameter problem for mixed graphs asks for\nthe largest possible order of a network with diameter $k$, maximum undirected\ndegree $\\leq r$ and maximum directed out-degree $\\leq z$. It is also of\ninterest to find smallest possible $k$-geodetic mixed graphs with minimum\nundirected degree $\\geq r$ and minimum directed out-degree $\\geq z$. A simple\ncounting argument reveals the existence of a natural bound, the \\emph{Moore\nbound}, on the order of such graphs; a graph that meets this limit is a\n\\emph{mixed Moore graph}. Mixed Moore graphs can exist only for $k = 2$ and\neven in this case it is known that they are extremely rare. It is therefore of\ninterest to search for graphs with order one away from the Moore bound. Such\ngraphs must be out-regular; a much more difficult question is whether they must\nbe totally regular. For $k = 2$, we answer this question in the affirmative,\nthereby resolving an open problem stated in a recent paper of L\\'opez and\nMiret. We also present partial results for larger $k$.

Though asteroseismology cannot probe the differential\nrotation of distant stars to the same level of detail that helioseismology can\nachieve for the Sun, it is possible that many cool stars with outer convective\nenvelopes possess similar differential rotation characteristics, including both\na tachocline and a NSSL.

Here, we study numerically how the induced propeller\nis changing for a librating moonlet. It turns out, that the libration of the\nmoonlet induces an asymmetry in the structural imprint of the propeller, where\nthe asymmetry is depending on the moonlet's libration period and amplitude.\nFurther, we study the dependence of the asymmetry on the libration period and\namplitude for a moonlet with 400 m Hill radius, which is located in the outer A\nring. In this way, we are able to apply our findings to the largest found\npropeller structures -- such as Bl\\'eriot -- which are expected to be of\nsimilar size. For Bl\\'eriot, we can conclude that, supposed the moonlet is\nlibrating with the largest observed period of 11.1 years and an azimuthal\namplitude of about 1845 km (Seiler et al. 2017, Spahn et al. 2018), a small\nassymmetry should be measurable but depends on the moonlet's libration phase at\nthe observation time. The excess motions of the other giant propellers -- such\nas Santos Dumont and Earhart -- have similar amplitudes as Bl\\'eriot and thus\nmight allow the observation of larger asymmetries due to their smaller\nazimuthal extent. This would permit to scan the whole gap structure for\nasymmetries.\n  Although the librational model of the moonlet is a simplification, our\nresults are a first step towards the development of a consistent model for the\ndescription of the formation of asymmetric propellers caused by a freely moving\nmoonlet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 23:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

To illustrate,\nthe question we study, let us consider the Set-Cover problem with n elements\nand m sets. Now we specify our goal to approximate Set-Cover to a factor of\n(1-d)ln n, for a given parameter 0<d<1. What is the best possible running time\nfor achieving such approximation? This question was answered implicitly in the\nwork of Moshkovitz [Theory of Computing, 2015]: Assuming both the Projection\nGames Conjecture (PGC) and the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH), any ((1-d) ln\nn)-approximation algorithm for Set-Cover must run in time >= 2^{n^{c d}}, for\nsome constant 0<d<1.\n  We study the questions along this line. First, we show that under ETH and PGC\nany ((1-d) \\ln n)-approximation for Set-Cover requires 2^{n^{d}}-time. This\n(almost) matches the running time of 2^{O(n^d)} for approximating Set-Cover to\na factor (1-d) ln n by Cygan et al. [IPL, 2009]. Our result is tight up to the\nconstant multiplying the n^{d} terms in the exponent. This lower bound applies\nto all of its generalizations, e.g., Group Steiner Tree (GST), Directed Steiner\n(DST), Covering Steiner Tree (CST), Connected Polymatroid (CP). We also show\nthat in almost exponential time, these problems reduce to Set-Cover: We show\n(1-d)ln n approximation algorithms for all these problems that run in time\n2^{n^{d \\log n } poly(m).\n  We also study log^{2-d}n approximation for GST. Chekuri-Pal [FOCS, 2005]\nshowed that GST admits (log^{2-d}n)-approximation in time\nexp(2^{log^{d+o(1)}n}), for any 0 < d < 1.

This paper views the process of generating equation as a\nbridge between the semantic world and the symbolic world, where the proposed\nneural math solver is based on an encoder-decoder framework.

There has been substantial discussion about whether these\nalgorithms are unfair to groups of individuals. While noble, this pursuit is\ncomplex and ultimately stagnating because there is no clear definition of\nfairness and competing definitions are largely incompatible. We argue that the\nfocus on the question of fairness is misplaced, as these algorithms fail to\nmeet a more important and yet readily obtainable goal: transparency. As a\nresult, creators of secret algorithms can provide incomplete or misleading\ndescriptions about how their models work, and various other kinds of errors can\neasily go unnoticed. By partially reverse engineering the COMPAS algorithm -- a\nrecidivism-risk scoring algorithm used throughout the criminal justice system\n-- we show that it does not seem to depend linearly on the defendant's age,\ndespite statements to the contrary by the algorithm's creator. Furthermore, by\nsubtracting from COMPAS its (hypothesized) nonlinear age component, we show\nthat COMPAS does not necessarily depend on race, contradicting ProPublica's\nanalysis, which assumed linearity in age. In other words, faulty assumptions\nabout a proprietary algorithm lead to faulty conclusions that go unchecked\nwithout careful reverse engineering. Were the algorithm transparent in the\nfirst place, this would likely not have occurred. The most important result in\nthis work is that we find that there are many defendants with low risk score\nbut long criminal histories, suggesting that data inconsistencies occur\nfrequently in criminal justice databases. We argue that transparency satisfies\na different notion of procedural fairness by providing both the defendants and\nthe public with the opportunity to scrutinize the methodology and calculations\nbehind risk scores for recidivism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 04:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 04:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

In this work, a new topological framework, called Linkage\nNetwork, is proposed to model the road networks and present the propagation\npatterns of traffic flow. Based on the Linkage Network model, a novel online\npredictor, named Graph Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN), is designed to learn\nthe propagation patterns in the graph. It could simultaneously predict traffic\nflow for all road segments based on the information gathered from the whole\ngraph, which thus reduces the computational complexity significantly from O(nm)\nto O(n+m), while keeping the high accuracy. Moreover, it can also predict the\nvariations of traffic trends.

A common defense against these attacks is data\nsanitization: first filter out anomalous training points before training the\nmodel. In this paper, we develop three attacks that can bypass a broad range of\ncommon data sanitization defenses, including anomaly detectors based on nearest\nneighbors, training loss, and singular-value decomposition. By adding just 3%\npoisoned data, our attacks successfully increase test error on the Enron spam\ndetection dataset from 3% to 24% and on the IMDB sentiment classification\ndataset from 12% to 29%. In contrast, existing attacks which do not explicitly\naccount for these data sanitization defenses are defeated by them. Our attacks\nare based on two ideas: (i) we coordinate our attacks to place poisoned points\nnear one another, and (ii) we formulate each attack as a constrained\noptimization problem, with constraints designed to ensure that the poisoned\npoints evade detection. As this optimization involves solving an expensive\nbilevel problem, our three attacks correspond to different ways of\napproximating this problem, based on influence functions; minimax duality; and\nthe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Our results underscore the need to\ndevelop more robust defenses against data poisoning attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 05:19:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2021 06:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

In this paper we\nargue that blockchain algorithms should tolerate both rational\n(self-interested) users and Byzantine (malicious) ones, rather than assuming\nall non-Byzantine users are altruistic and follow the protocols blindly. Such\nalgorithms are called BAR-tolerant [1]. To design a BAR-tolerant system, one\ncan follow these three steps: clearly define the utility function for the\nrational users, prove the algorithm is such that there is no benefit from\nunilaterally deviating (that is, it's a Byzantine Nash Equilibrium), then prove\nthe algorithm correct assuming the rational actors follow the protocol. We\npresent an example attack by rational users: the gatekeeping attack, where\nmembers of a system selfishly decide to prevent newcomers from joining. This\nattack may affect any stake-based system where the existing members prevent\nnewcomers from making a stake, and essentially form a cartel. We then sketch a\nBAR-tolerant consensus protocol for blockchain that can defend against this\nattack. It relies on a strict order to decide who gets to propose a new block\n(so there's no need to race to solve a crypto puzzle) and it relies on hardware\nID tokens to make sure every computer is only represented at most once as a\nblock proposer to mitigate Sybil attacks. It also defends against the\ngatekeeper attack. The BAR-tolerant approach is naturally also applicable to\nother blockchain algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 05:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

This allows him/her to use\nthese risks to make accurate predictions about prognosis and decisions about\nscreening, treatments for the current patient. We develop Risk-stratify - a two\nphase algorithm that is designed to achieve confident risk-stratification. In\nthe first phase, we grow a tree to partition the covariate space. Each node in\nthe tree is split using statistical tests that determine if the risks of the\nchild nodes are different or not. The choice of the statistical tests depends\non whether the data is censored (Log-rank test) or not (U-test). The set of the\nleaves of the tree form a partition. The risk distribution of patients that\nbelong to a leaf is different from the sibling leaf but not the rest of the\nleaves. Therefore, some of the leaves that have similar underlying risks are\nincorrectly specified to have different risks. In the second phase, we develop\na novel recursive graph decomposition approach to address this problem. We\nmerge the leaves of the tree that have similar risks to form new leaves that\nform the final output. We apply Risk-stratify on a cohort of patients (with no\nhistory of cardiovascular disease) from UK Biobank and assess their risk for\ncardiovascular disease. Risk-stratify significantly improves\nrisk-stratification, i.e., a lower fraction of the groups have over/under\nestimated risks (measured in terms of false discovery rate; 33% reduction) in\ncomparison to state-of-the-art methods for cardiovascular prediction (Random\nforests, Cox model, etc.). We find that the Cox model significantly over\nestimates the risk of 21,621 patients out of 216,211 patients. Risk-stratify\ncan accurately categorize 2,987 of these 21,621 patients as low-risk\nindividuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 06:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

Thus, if the asteroid moved from the region of a 5:2 or 8:3 mean motion\nresonance with Jupiter to its present orbit less than $1$ Myr ago, it may have\nretained much of its primordial ice. The dust mantle on the sublimating body\nshould have a thickness of at least $15$ m but the mantle could have been less\nthan $1$ m thick $1000$ years ago. We find that the total gas production rate\ncould have been as large as $10^{27}\\rm~s^{-1}$ then, and the gas flow could\nhave been capable of lifting dust particles of up to a few centimeters in size.\nTherefore, gas production during the past millennium could have been sufficient\nto blow away enough dust particles to explain the entire Geminid stream.

In addition, we find\nthat the large surface temperature variation of $>600$ K near perihelion can\ngenerate sufficiently large thermal stress to cause fracture of rocks or\nboulders and provide an efficient mechanism to produce dust particles on the\nsurface.

The proposed technique is aimed at\nsolving explicitly constrained black-box continuous optimization problems, in\nwhich the explicit constraint is a constraint whereby the computational time\nfor the constraint violation and its (numerical) gradient are negligible\ncompared to that for the objective function. This method is designed to realize\ntwo invariance properties: invariance to the affine transformation of the\nsearch space, and invariance to the increasing transformation of the objective\nand constraint functions. The CMA-ES is designed to possess these properties\nfor handling difficulties that appear in black-box optimization problems, such\nas non-separability, ill-conditioning, ruggedness, and the different orders of\nmagnitude in the objective. The proposed constraint-handling technique (CHT),\nknown as ARCH, modifies the underlying CMA-ES only in terms of the ranking of\nthe candidate solutions. It employs a repair operator and an adaptive ranking\naggregation strategy to compute the ranking. We developed test problems to\nevaluate the effects of the invariance properties, and performed experiments to\nempirically verify the invariance of the algorithm. We compared the proposed\nmethod with other CHTs on the CEC 2006 constrained optimization benchmark suite\nto demonstrate its efficacy. Empirical studies reveal that ARCH is able to\nexploit the explicitness of the constraint functions effectively, sometimes\neven more efficiently than an existing box-constraint handling technique on\nbox-constrained problems, while exhibiting the invariance properties. Moreover,\nARCH overwhelmingly outperforms CHTs by not exploiting the explicit constraints\nin terms of the number of objective function calls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 07:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 23:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

This in turn implies a cohomological meaning of these values. Since\nmost of the other values do not appear in this formula, it will be a natural\nquestion to ask if there is a similar cohomological meaning for such values.

The\neffect of the presence of hyperons on the radius, the direct Urca processes,\nand the cooling of accreting neutron stars are discussed.

For models\nwhich allow for the direct Urca process to operate, hyperonic and purely\nnucleonic ones are shown to have a similar luminosity when hyperons are\nincluded in agreement with modern experimental data. It is shown that for a\ndensity dependent hadronic model constrained by experimental, theoretical and\nobservational data, the low-luminosity of SAX J$1808.4-3658$ can only be\nmodelled for a hyperonic NS, suggesting that hyperons could be present in its\ncore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 09:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

One way\nto reduce the search effort is to fix the length of the path's segment and to\nprune the nodes that violate the imposed constraint. This leads to\nincompleteness and to the sensitivity of the 's performance to chosen parameter\nvalue. In this work we introduce a novel technique that reduces this\nsensitivity by automatically adjusting the length of the path's segment\non-the-fly, e.g. during the search. Embedding this technique into the known\ngrid-based angle-constrained path finding algorithm - LIAN, leads to notable\nincrease of the planner's effectiveness, e.g. success rate, while keeping\nefficiency, e.g. runtime, overhead at reasonable level. Experimental evaluation\nshows that LIAN with the suggested enhancements, dubbed eLIAN, solves up to\n20\\% of tasks more compared to the predecessor.

Test resources are usually limited and therefore it is often not\npossible to completely test an application before a release. To cope with the\nproblem of scarce resources, development teams can apply defect prediction to\nidentify fault-prone code regions. However, defect prediction tends to low\nprecision in cross-project prediction scenarios.\n  Aims. We take an inverse view on defect prediction and aim to identify\nmethods that can be deferred when testing because they contain hardly any\nfaults due to their code being \"trivial\".

While Quicksort is very fast on average, Mergesort additionally\ngives worst-case guarantees, but needs extra space for a linear number of\nelements. Worst-case efficient in-place sorting, however, remains a challenge:\nthe standard solution, Heapsort, suffers from a bad cache behavior and is also\nnot overly fast for in-cache instances.\n  In this work we present median-of-medians QuickMergesort (MoMQuickMergesort),\na new variant of QuickMergesort, which combines Quicksort with Mergesort\nallowing the latter to be implemented in place. Our new variant applies the\nmedian-of-medians algorithm for selecting pivots in order to circumvent the\nquadratic worst case. Indeed, we show that it uses at most $n \\log n + 1.6n$\ncomparisons for $n$ large enough.\n  We experimentally confirm the theoretical estimates and show that the new\nalgorithm outperforms Heapsort by far and is only around 10% slower than\nIntrosort (std::sort implementation of stdlibc++), which has a rather poor\nguarantee for the worst case. We also simulate the worst case, which is only\naround 10% slower than the average case. In particular, the new algorithm is a\nnatural candidate to replace Heapsort as a worst-case stopper in Introsort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 12:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

Asymmetric transitivity is\nan essential property of directed graphs, since it can play an important role\nin downstream graph inference and analysis. Question difficulty and user\nexpertise follow the characteristic of asymmetric transitivity. Maintaining\nsuch properties, while reducing the graph to a lower dimensional vector\nembedding space, has been the focus of much recent research. In this paper, we\ntackle the challenge of directed graph embedding with asymmetric transitivity\npreservation and then leverage the proposed embedding method to solve a\nfundamental task in CQAs: how to appropriately route and assign newly posted\nquestions to users with the suitable expertise and interest in CQAs. The\ntechnique incorporates graph hierarchy and reachability information naturally\nby relying on a non-linear transformation that operates on the core\nreachability and implicit hierarchy within such graphs.

Nevertheless, recently it has been shown to be possible to\ngive a non-trivial certified lower bound of minimum adversarial distortion, and\nsome recent progress has been made towards this direction by exploiting the\npiece-wise linear nature of ReLU activations. However, a generic robustness\ncertification for general activation functions still remains largely\nunexplored. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce CROWN, a general\nframework to certify robustness of neural networks with general activation\nfunctions for given input data points. The novelty in our algorithm consists of\nbounding a given activation function with linear and quadratic functions, hence\nallowing it to tackle general activation functions including but not limited to\nfour popular choices: ReLU, tanh, sigmoid and arctan. In addition, we\nfacilitate the search for a tighter certified lower bound by adaptively\nselecting appropriate surrogates for each neuron activation. Experimental\nresults show that CROWN on ReLU networks can notably improve the certified\nlower bounds compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm Fast-Lin, while\nhaving comparable computational efficiency. Furthermore, CROWN also\ndemonstrates its effectiveness and flexibility on networks with general\nactivation functions, including tanh, sigmoid and arctan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 14:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

Instead, they crowd fluid environments in\nanticipation of a random encounter with a bacterium. Once they land on the cell\nbody of their victim, they are able to eject their genetic material inside the\nhost cell. Many phage species, however, first attach to the flagellar filaments\nof bacteria. Being immotile, these so-called flagellotropic phages still manage\nto reach the cell body for infection, and the process by which they move up the\nflagellar filament has intrigued the scientific community for decades. In 1973,\nBerg and Anderson (Nature, 245, 380) proposed the nut-and-bolt mechanism in\nwhich, similarly to a rotated nut that is able to move along a bolt, the phage\nwraps itself around a flagellar filament possessing helical grooves (due to the\nhelical rows of flagellin molecules) and exploits the rotation of the flagellar\nfilament in order to passively travel along it. One of the main evidence for\nthis mechanism is the fact that mutants of bacterial species such as\nEscherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium that possess straight flagellar\nfilaments with a preserved helical groove structure can still be infected by\ntheir relative phages. Using two distinct approaches to address the short-range\ninteractions between phages and flagellar filaments, we provide here a\nfirst-principle theoretical model for the nut-and-bolt mechanism applicable to\nmutants possessing straight flagellar filaments. Our model is fully analytical,\nis able to predict the speed of translocation of a bacteriophage along a\nflagellar filament as a function of the geometry of both phage and bacterium,\nthe rotation rate of the flagellar filament, and the handedness of the helical\ngrooves, and is consistent with past experimental observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 14:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-05"}

We develop an algorithm that finds the optimal power allocation over\nthe two-layers and across the OFDMA radio resources in static channels and a\nclass of fading channels. Two main use-cases are considered: i) Multicast and\nunicast multiplexing when $K$ users with uplink capabilities request both\ncommon and independent messages, and ii) broadcast and unicast multiplexing\nwhen the common message targets receive-only devices and $K$ users with uplink\ncapabilities additionally request independent messages. Finally, we develop a\ntransceiver design for broadcast/multicast and unicast superposition\ntransmission based on LTE-A-Pro physical layer and show with numerical\nevaluations in mobile environments with multipath propagation that the capacity\nimprovements can be translated into significant practical performance gains\ncompared to the orthogonal schemes in the 3GPP specifications. We also analyze\nthe impact of real channel estimation and show that significant gains in terms\nof spectral efficiency or coverage area are still available even with\nestimation errors and imperfect interference cancellation for the two-layered\nsuperposition system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 15:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 22:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 23:29:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 14:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

Although classifiers for a target\ndomain can be trained on labeled text data from a related source domain, the\naccuracy of such classifiers is usually lower in the cross-domain setting.\nRecently, string kernels have obtained state-of-the-art results in various text\nclassification tasks such as native language identification or automatic essay\nscoring. Moreover, classifiers based on string kernels have been found to be\nrobust to the distribution gap between different domains. In this paper, we\nformally describe an algorithm composed of two simple yet effective\ntransductive learning approaches to further improve the results of string\nkernels in cross-domain settings. By adapting string kernels to the test set\nwithout using the ground-truth test labels, we report significantly better\naccuracy rates in cross-domain English polarity classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 08:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

Specifically, we study stochastic\nbifurcation for three prototypical dynamical systems (i.e., saddle-node,\ntranscritical, and pitchfork systems) under multiplicative Gaussian noise, and\nhave found some interesting phenomena in contrast to the corresponding\ndeterministic counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 02:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

In this paper, we propose an online stochastic\npolicy that jointly controls energy transmission from the EAP to the nodes and\ndata transfer among the nodes. For this purpose, we first introduce a novel\nperturbed Lyapunov function to address the limitations on the energy\nconsumption of the nodes imposed by their batteries. Then, using Lyapunov\noptimization method, we propose a policy which is adaptive to any arbitrary\nchannel statistics in the network. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis for\nthe performance of the proposed policy and show that it stabilizes the network,\nand the average power consumption of the network under this policy is within a\nbounded gap of the minimum power level required for stabilizing the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 21:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

This paper offers a first step in\ncovering this gap by first solving numerically the characteristic equation\nderived from Maxwell equations, then deriving an analytical expression for the\ntransfer function, and finally reporting for the first time capacity values for\nbare metal open waveguides.

It is essentially a physical storage system which\nprovides large storage of data and faster computing to users over the Internet.\nIn this cloud system, the third party allows to preserve data of clients or\nusers only for business purpose and also for a limited period of time. The\nusers are used to share data confidentially among themselves and to store data\nvirtually to save the cost of physical devices as well as the time. In this\npaper, we propose a discrete dynamical system for cloud computing and data\nmanagement of the storage service between a third party and users. A framework,\ncomprised of different techniques and procedures for distribution of storage\nand their implementation with users and the third party is given. For\nillustration purpose, the model is considered for two users and a third party,\nand its dynamical properties are briefly analyzed and discussed. It is shown\nthat the discrete system exhibits periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic states.\nThe latter discerns that the cloud computing system with distribution of data\nand storage between users and the third party may be secured. Some issues of\ndata security are discussed and a random replication scheme is proposed to\nensure that the data loss can be highly reduced compared to the existing\nschemes in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 13:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}
