A new version of the\nCSP, the promise CSP (PCSP) has recently been proposed, motivated by open\nquestions about the approximability of variants of satisfiability and graph\ncolouring. The PCSP significantly extends the standard decision CSP. The\ncomplexity of CSPs with a fixed constraint language on a finite domain has\nrecently been fully classified, greatly guided by the algebraic approach, which\nuses polymorphisms --- high-dimensional symmetries of solution spaces --- to\nanalyse the complexity of problems. The corresponding classification for PCSPs\nis wide open and includes some long-standing open questions, such as the\ncomplexity of approximate graph colouring, as special cases.\n  The basic algebraic approach to PCSP was initiated by Brakensiek and\nGuruswami, and in this paper we significantly extend it and lift it from\nconcrete properties of polymorphisms to their abstract properties. We introduce\na new class of problems that can be viewed as algebraic versions of the (Gap)\nLabel Cover problem, and show that every PCSP with a fixed constraint language\nis equivalent to a problem of this form. This allows us to identify a \"measure\nof symmetry\" that is well suited for comparing and relating the complexity of\ndifferent PCSPs via the algebraic approach. We demonstrate how our theory can\nbe applied by improving the state-of-the-art in approximate graph colouring: we\nshow that, for any $k\\geq 3$, it is NP-hard to find a $(2k-1)$-colouring of a\ngiven $k$-colourable graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 16:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 14:38:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

This is particularly true for\nmulticarrier waveforms, which have high peak-to-average ratio in the time\ndomain and fragile subcarrier orthogonality in the frequency domain. The severe\ndistortion for one-bit quantization typically results in an error floor even at\nmoderately low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) such as 5 dB. For channel estimation\n(using pilots), we design a novel generative supervised deep neural network\n(DNN) that can be trained with a reasonable number of pilots. After channel\nestimation, a neural network-based receiver -- specifically, an autoencoder --\njointly learns a precoder and decoder for data symbol detection. Since\nquantization prevents end-to-end training, we propose a two-step sequential\ntraining policy for this model.

Gibbs sampling can be used to sample from\nthe posterior, but problems arise when the dimension of the state is large.\nThis is because the Gaussian sample required for each iteration can be\nprohibitively expensive to compute, and because the statistical efficiency of\nthe Markov chain degrades as the dimension of the state increases.

The ramifications, limits, and weaknesses of the PBR\nassumptions, especially in light of lessons learned from Bell's theorem, are\nelucidated. It is shown that, if valid, PBRs' conclusion specifies what type of\nensemble interpretations are possible. The PBR conclusion would require a more\ndirect correspondence between the quantum state (e.g., $|\\psi>$) and the\nreality it describes than might otherwise be expected. A simple terminology is\nintroduced to clarify this greater correspondence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 22:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

Target-specific expansions serve to lower the cost of the formation and\nevaluation of QBX local expansions, reducing the associated computational\neffort from $O((p+1)^{2})$ to $O(p+1)$ in three dimensions, without any\naccuracy loss compared with conventional expansions, but with the loss of\nsource/target separation in the expansion coefficients. GIGAQBX is a `global'\nQBX scheme, meaning that the potential is mediated entirely through expansions\nfor points close to or on the boundary. In our scheme, this single global\nexpansion is decomposed into two parts that are evaluated separately: one part\nincorporating near-field contributions using target-specific expansions, and\none part using conventional spherical harmonic expansions of far-field\ncontributions, noting that convergence guarantees only exist for the sum of the\ntwo sub-expansions.

The abundance of PBHs\nformed during radiation domination is sensitive to the tail of the probability\ndistribution of primordial fluctuations. We quantify the level of fine-tuning\ndue to this sensitivity. For example, if the main source of dark matter is PBHs\nwith mass $10^{-12}M_\\odot$, then anthropic reasoning suggests that the dark\nmatter to baryon ratio should range between 1 and 300. For this to happen, the\nroot-mean-square amplitude of the curvature perturbation has to be fine-tuned\nwithin a $7.1\\%$ range. As another example, if the recently detected\ngravitational-wave events are to be explained by PBHs, the corresponding degree\nof fine-tuning is $3.8\\%$. We also find, however, that these fine-tunings can\nbe relaxed if the primordial fluctuations are highly non-Gaussian, or if the\nPBHs are formed during an early-matter-dominated phase. We also note that no\nfine-tuning is needed for the scenario of a reheating of the universe by\nevaporated PBHs with Planck-mass relics left to serve as dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 23:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

We propose VIREL, a novel,\ntheoretically grounded probabilistic inference framework for RL that utilises a\nparametrised action-value function to summarise future dynamics of the\nunderlying MDP.

Massive galaxies with\nmore extended stellar mass distributions tend to live in more massive dark\nmatter haloes. We explain this connection with a phenomenological model that\nassumes, (1) a tight relation between the halo mass and the total stellar\ncontent in the halo, (2) that the fraction of in-situ and ex-situ mass at\n$r<10$ kpc depends on halo mass. This model provides an excellent description\nof the stellar mass functions (SMF) of total stellar mass ($M_{\\star}^{\\rm\nMax}$) and stellar mass within inner 10 kpc ($M_{\\star}^{10}$) and also\nreproduces the HSC weak lensing signals of massive galaxies with different\nstellar mass distributions. The best-fit model shows that halo mass varies\nsignificantly at fixed total stellar mass (as much as 0.4 dex) with a clear\ndependence on $M_{\\star}^{10}$. Our two-parameter $M_{\\star}^{\\rm\nMax}$-$M_{\\star}^{10}$ description provides a more accurate picture of the\ngalaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end than the simple stellar-halo mass\nrelation (SHMR) and opens a new window to connect the assembly history of halos\nwith those of central galaxies.

This data is often moved between\ngeographically distributed sites for various purposes such as collaboration and\nbackup which has led to significant increase in data transfer rates. Surge in\ndata transfer rates when combined with proliferation of scientific applications\nthat cannot tolerate data corruption triggered enhanced integrity verification\ntechniques to be developed. End-to-end integrity verification minimizes the\nlikelihood of silent data corruption by comparing checksum of files at source\nand destination servers using secure hash algorithms such as MD5 and SHA1.\nHowever, it imposes significant performance penalty due to overhead of checksum\ncomputation. In this paper, we propose Fast Integrity VERification (FIVER)\nalgorithm which overlaps checksum computation and data transfer operations of\nfiles to minimize the cost of integrity verification. Extensive experiments\nshow that FIVER is able to bring down the cost from 60% by the state-of-the-art\nsolutions to below 10% by concurrently executing transfer and checksum\noperations and enabling file I/O share between them. We also implemented\nFIVER-Hybrid to mimic disk access patterns of sequential integrity verification\napproach to capture possible data corruption that may occur during file write\noperations which FIVER may miss. Results show that FIVER-Hybrid is able to\nreduce execution time by 20% compared to sequential approach without\ncompromising the reliability of integrity verification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2018 04:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

The\nidea is to study the expected performance on small perturbations of the worst\ninput. The performance is measured in terms of the magnitude $\\delta$ of the\nperturbation and the input size. We consider four different models of\nperturbation. We show that the expected number of bits to describe optimal\nguard positions per guard is logarithmic in the input and the magnitude of the\nperturbation. This shows from a theoretical perspective that rational guards\nwith small bit-complexity are typical. Note that describing the guard position\nis the bottleneck to show NP-membership. The significance of our results is\nthat algebraic methods are not needed to solve the Art Gallery Problem in\ntypical instances. This is the first time an $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-complete\nproblem was analyzed by Smoothed Analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2018 08:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

Existing SDP solvers by classical convex optimization are\nexpensive to solve large-scale problems. Employing the low rank of solution,\nBurer-Monteiro's method reformulated SDP as a nonconvex problem via the\n$quadratic$ factorization ($Z$ as $XX^\\top$). However, this would lose the\nstructure of problem in optimization. In this paper, we propose to convert SDP\ninto a biconvex problem via the $bilinear$ factorization ($Z$ as $XY^\\top$),\nand while adding the term $\\frac{\\gamma}{2}||X-Y||_F^2$ to penalize the\ndifference of $X$ and $Y$. Thus, the biconvex structure (w.r.t. $X$ and $Y$)\ncan be exploited naturally in optimization. As a theoretical result, we provide\na bound to the penalty parameter $\\gamma$ under the assumption of $L$-Lipschitz\nsmoothness and $\\sigma $-strongly biconvexity, such that, at stationary points,\nthe proposed bilinear factorization is equivalent to Burer-Monteiro's\nfactorization when the bound is arrived, that is\n$\\gamma>\\frac{1}{4}(L-\\sigma)_+$.

In this\npaper, we propose \\textit{deep ad-hoc beamforming}, a deep-learning-based\nmultichannel speech enhancement framework based on ad-hoc microphone arrays, to\naddress the problem. It contains three novel components. First, it combines\n\\textit{ad-hoc microphone arrays} with deep-learning-based multichannel speech\nenhancement, which reduces the probability of the occurrence of far-field\nacoustic environments significantly. Second, it groups the microphones around\nthe speech source to a local microphone array by a supervised channel selection\nframework based on deep neural networks. Third, it develops a simple time\nsynchronization framework to synchronize the channels that have different time\ndelay. Besides the above novelties and advantages, the proposed model is also\ntrained in a single-channel fashion, so that it can easily employ new\ndevelopment of speech processing techniques. Its test stage is also flexible in\nincorporating any number of microphones without retraining or modifying the\nframework. We have developed many implementations of the proposed framework and\nconducted an extensive experiment in scenarios where the locations of the\nspeech sources are far-field, random, and blind to the microphones. Results on\nspeech enhancement tasks show that our method outperforms its counterpart that\nworks with linear microphone arrays by a considerable margin in both diffuse\nnoise reverberant environments and point source noise reverberant environments.\nWe have also tested the framework with different handcrafted features.

We have two motivations. A classic result on\nthe gap between list chromatic number and the chromatic number tells us\n$\\chi_\\ell(K_{a,b}) = 1 + a$ if and only if $b \\geq a^a$. Since\n$\\chi_\\ell(K_{a,b}) \\leq 1 + a$ for any $b \\in \\mathbb{N}$, this result tells\nus the values of $b$ for which $\\chi_\\ell(K_{a,b})$ is as large as possible and\nfar from $\\chi(K_{a,b})=2$. In this paper we seek to understand when\n$\\chi_\\ell(G \\square K_{a,b})$ is far from $\\chi(G \\square K_{a,b}) = \\max\n\\{\\chi(G), 2 \\}$. It is easy to show $\\chi_\\ell(G \\square K_{a,b}) \\leq\n\\chi_\\ell (G) + a$. In 2006, Borowiecki, Jendrol, Kr\\'al, and Miskuf showed\nthat this bound is attainable if $b$ is sufficiently large; specifically,\n$\\chi_\\ell(G \\square K_{a,b}) = \\chi_\\ell (G) + a$ whenever $b \\geq\n(\\chi_\\ell(G) + a - 1)^{a|V(G)|}$. Given any graph $G$ and $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\nwe wish to determine the smallest $b$ such that $\\chi_\\ell(G \\square K_{a,b}) =\n\\chi_\\ell (G) + a$. In this paper we show that the list color function, a list\nanalogue of the chromatic polynomial, provides the right concept and tool for\nmaking progress on this problem. Using the list color function, we prove a\ngeneral improvement on Borowiecki et al.'s 2006 result, and we compute the\nsmallest such $b$ exactly for some large families of chromatic-choosable\ngraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 18:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

For that criterion, the optimal\ndecision is the Bayesian minimum-risk estimator. However, the computational\nload of the Bayesian estimator is often prohibitive and, hence, efficient\ncomputational schemes are required. The design of novel schemes, striking new\nbalances between accuracy and computational load, is the primary concern of\nthis thesis. Two popular techniques, one exact and one approximate, will be\nstudied.\n  The exact scheme is a recursive one, namely the generalized distributive law\n(GDL), whose purpose is to distribute all operators across the conditionally\nindependent (CI) factors of the joint model, so as to reduce the total number\nof operators required. In a novel theorem derived in this thesis, GDL, if\napplicable, will be shown to guarantee such a reduction in all cases. An\nassociated lemma also quantifies this reduction. For practical use, two novel\nalgorithms, namely the no-longer-needed (NLN) algorithm and the generalized\nform of the Markovian Forward-Backward (FB) algorithm, recursively factorizes\nand computes the CI factors of an arbitrary model, respectively.\n  The approximate scheme is an iterative one, namely the Variational Bayes (VB)\napproximation, whose purpose is to find the independent (i.e. zero-order\nMarkov) model closest to the true joint model in the minimum Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence (KLD) sense. Despite being computationally efficient, this naive\nmean field approximation confers only modest performance for highly correlated\nmodels. A novel approximation, namely Transformed Variational Bayes (TVB), will\nbe designed in the thesis in order to relax the zero-order constraint in the VB\napproximation, further reducing the KLD of the optimal approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2018 12:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

This demonstrates the intimate connection between\nthe electron's magnetic moment $\\mu_B=e\\hbar/2m_ec$, associated with its spin\nangular momentum $S=\\hbar/2$, and ferromagnetism. When a magnetic field is\napplied to a superconducting body it also starts to spin (gyromagnetic effect),\nand when a normal metal in a magnetic field becomes superconducting and expels\nthe magnetic field (Meissner effect) the body also starts to spin. Yet\naccording to the conventional theory of superconductivity the electron's spin\nonly role is to label states, and the electron's magnetic moment plays no role\nin superconductivity. Instead, within the unconventional theory of hole\nsuperconductivity, the electron's spin and associated magnetic moment play a\nfundamental role in superconductivity. Just like in ferromagnets the\nmagnetization of superconductors is predicted to result from an aggregation of\nmagnetic moments with angular momenta $\\hbar/2$. This gives rise to a \"Spin\nMeissner effect\", the existence of a spin current in the ground state of\nsuperconductors.

Recently, CapsuleNets have overtaken traditional DNNs,\nbecause of their improved generalization ability due to the multi-dimensional\ncapsules, in contrast to the single-dimensional neurons. Consequently,\nCapsuleNets also require extremely intense matrix computations, making it a\ngigantic challenge to achieve high performance. In this paper, we propose\nCapsAcc, the first specialized CMOS-based hardware architecture to perform\nCapsuleNets inference with high performance and energy efficiency.\nState-of-the-art convolutional DNN accelerators would not work efficiently for\nCapsuleNets, as their designs do not account for key operations involved in\nCapsuleNets, like squashing and dynamic routing, as well as multi-dimensional\nmatrix processing. Our CapsAcc architecture targets this problem and achieves\nsignificant improvements, when compared to an optimized GPU implementation. Our\narchitecture exploits the massive parallelism by flexibly feeding the data to a\nspecialized systolic array according to the operations required in different\nlayers. It also avoids extensive load and store operations on the on-chip\nmemory, by reusing the data when possible. We further optimize the routing\nalgorithm to reduce the computations needed at this stage. We synthesized the\ncomplete CapsAcc architecture in a 32nm CMOS technology using Synopsys design\ntools, and evaluated it for the MNIST benchmark (as also done by the original\nCapsuleNet paper) to ensure consistent and fair comparisons. This work enables\nhighly-efficient CapsuleNets inference on embedded platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2018 16:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Applications to harmonic oscillators and particle\ninsertion in Lennard-Jones fluid agree well with the (numerical) exact\nsolutions.

However, methods such as using\nprotective coatings, and modifying the structure or composition of the material\nhave been used to slow down gradual corrosion and fortunately they proved to be\nquite beneficial. The research focus has shifted to integrating novel materials\nand structures to improve the corrosion resistance of composites. Carbon\nnanotubes (CNTs) are an attractive and promising filler due to their chemical\ninertness and high mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. CNTs can\nfill the gaps of metals and polymer-based composites by forming a passive layer\non metals and promoting sacrificial protection in zinc rich polymer (ZRP)\ncoatings, and can therefore function as an anti-corrosion filler. This paper\nreviews the research that has been performed to better understand the influence\nof CNTs on corrosion resistance in composites. Accordingly, in metal matrix\ncomposites (MMCs), most of the work has been carried out on electrodeposited\ncoatings, namely Ni-based-CNT composites, which show improved corrosion\nresistance by CNT addition. On the other hand, there are a few papers that have\nstudied the corrosion resistance of Mg-based-CNT composites and their corrosion\nresults contradict those obtained from other metal-CNT composites. For ZRPs or\npolymer-based coatings there are a few papers that studied the effect of CNTs\non the corrosion of said composites. It is believed that CNTs can strengthen\nthe adhesion between the coating and the substrate and facilitate sacrificial\nprotection by Zn particles by forming a conductive network, hence the improved\ncorrosion resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2018 03:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}
