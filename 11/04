The complexity of comparison based external memory\nsorting has been understood for decades by now, however the situation remains\nelusive if we assume the keys to be sorted are integers. In internal memory,\none can sort a set of $n$ integer keys of $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ bits each in $O(n)$\ntime using the classic Radix Sort algorithm, however in external memory, there\nare no faster integer sorting algorithms known than the simple comparison based\nones.

This is in sharp contrast to the classic (non-oblivious) Radix Sort\nalgorithm.

Hence we treated the events as one observed from three different\nviewing angles, and found that the primary front directly associated with the\nCME consistently transmits through 1) a polar coronal hole, 2) the ends of a\ncrescent-shaped equatorial coronal hole, leaving a stationary front outlining\nits AR-facing boundary, and 3) two quiescent filaments, producing slow and\ndiffuse secondary fronts. The primary front also propagates along an arcade of\ncoronal loops and slows down due to foreshortening at the far side, where local\nplasma heating is indicated by an enhancement in 211 {\\AA} (Fe XIV) but a\ndimming in 193 {\\AA} (Fe XII) and 171 {\\AA} (Fe IX). The strength of coronal\nmagnetic field is therefore estimated to be $\\sim\\,$2 G in the polar coronal\nhole and $\\sim\\,$4 G in the coronal arcade neighboring the active region. These\nobservations substantiate the wave nature of the primary front and shed new\nlight on slow fronts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 05:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

However, 3D networks have some drawbacks due to their\nhigh cost on computational resources. In this paper, we propose a 3D hybrid\nresidual attention-aware segmentation method, named RA-UNet, to precisely\nextract the liver volume of interests (VOI) and segment tumors from the liver\nVOI. The proposed network has a basic architecture as a 3D U-Net which extracts\ncontextual information combining low-level feature maps with high-level ones.\nAttention modules are stacked so that the attention-aware features change\nadaptively as the network goes \"very deep\" and this is made possible by\nresidual learning.

This prevents generator from producing\nnearly identical data samples from different latent samples, and reduces mode\ncollapse. We propose an inverse t-SNE regularizer to achieve this.

Each type leads to a different restored image\nand the best result is automatically chosen based on color distribution.\n  We collected a dataset of images taken in different locations with varying\nwater properties, showing color charts in the scenes. Moreover, to obtain\nground truth, the 3D structure of the scene was calculated based on stereo\nimaging. This dataset enables a quantitative evaluation of restoration\nalgorithms on natural images and shows the advantage of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 09:16:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 17:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2019 20:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

As such, they offer additional levels of hardware\nparallelism. Each such level requires and employs algorithms for appropriately\nscheduling the computational work at the respective level. The present work\nexplores the relation between two scheduling levels: batch and application.\nUnderstanding this relation is important for improving the performance of\nscientific applications, that are scheduled and executed in batches on HPC\nsystems. The relation between batch and application level scheduling is\nunderstudied in the literature. Understanding the relation and interaction\nbetween these two scheduling levels requires their simultaneous analysis during\noperation. In this work, such an analysis is performed via simultaneous\nsimulation of batch and application level scheduling for a number of scenarios.\nA generic simulation approach is presented that bridges two existing simulators\nfrom the two scheduling levels. A novel two-level simulator that implements the\nproposed approach is introduced. The two-level simulator is used to simulate\nall combinations of three batch scheduling and four application scheduling\nalgorithms from the literature. These combinations are considered for\nallocating resources and executing the parallel jobs of two batches from two\nproduction HPC systems. The results of the scheduling experiments reveal the\nstrong relation between the two scheduling levels and their mutual influence.\nComplementing the simulations, the two-level simulator produces standard\nparallel execution traces, which can visually be examined and which illustrate\nthe execution of different jobs and, for each job, the execution of its tasks\nat node and core levels, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 09:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

Finally,\nthey use estimated pairwise preferences to infer the total ranking of items for\nthe target user. This general approach faces some problems as the rank data is\nusually sparse as users usually have compared only a few pairs of items and\nconsequently, the similarities among users is calculated based on limited\ninformation and is not accurate enough for inferring true values of preference\nconcordance and can lead to an invalid ranking of items. This article presents\na novel framework, called IteRank, that models the data as a bipartite network\ncontaining users and pairwise preferences. It then simultaneously refines\nusers' similarities and preferences' concordances using a random walk method on\nthis graph structure. It uses the information in this first step in another\nnetwork structure for simultaneously adjusting the concordances of preferences\nand rankings of items. Using this approach, IteRank can overcome some existing\nproblems caused by the sparsity of the data. Experimental results show that\nIteRank improves the performance of recommendation compared to the state of the\nart NCR techniques that use the traditional NCR framework for recommendation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 10:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first result on the lower bound of (nonuniform) bounded\nwidth circuits computing an explicit Boolean function, even for deterministic\ncircuits.

We\nexamined experimental trajectories of organelles inside a living cell and\npropose a mathematical model that describes the previously reported transition\nfrom sub-diffusive to super-diffusive motion. In order to explain\nsuper-diffusive behaviour at long times, we introduce non-Markovian detachment\nkinetics of the cargo: the rate of detachment is inversely proportional to the\ntime since the last attachment. Recently, we observed the non-Markovian\ndetachment rate experimentally in eukaryotic cells.

The non-Markovian model is successful in simultaneously describing the\ntime-averaged variance (the time-averaged mean squared displacement corrected\nfor directed motion), the mean first passage time of trajectories and the\nmultiple peaks observed in the distributions of cargo velocities. We argue that\nnon-Markovian kinetics could be biologically beneficial compared to the\nMarkovian kinetics commonly used for modelling, by increasing the average\ndistance the cargoes travel when a microtubule is blocked by other filaments.\nIn turn, sub-diffusion allows cargoes to reach neighbouring filaments with\nhigher probability, which promotes active motion along the microtubules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 11:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

In the P4-THINC-BVD scheme,\npolynomial of degree four and THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface\nCapturing) functions with adaptive steepness are used as the candidate\nreconstruction functions. The final reconstruction function is selected from\nthe candidate functions by a two-stage cascade BVD algorithm so as to\neffectively control numerical oscillation and dissipation. Spectral analysis\nand numerical verifications show that the P4-THINC-BVD scheme possesses the\nfollowing desirable properties: 1) it effectively suppresses spurious numerical\noscillation in the presence of strong shock or discontinuity; 2) it\nsubstantially reduces numerical dissipation errors; 3) it automatically\nretrieves the underlying linear 5th-order upwind scheme for smooth solution\nover all wave numbers; 4) it is able to resolve both smooth and discontinuous\nflow structures of all scales with substantially improved solution quality in\ncomparison to other existing methods; and 5) it faithfully maintains the\nfree-mode solutions in long term computation.
