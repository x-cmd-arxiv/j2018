However, for certain transactions, difference in opinion may exist among\nendorsers. Disclosing the identity of an endorser may lead to conflict within\nthe consortium. In such cases, an endorsement policy which not only allows an\nendorser to support a transaction discreetly, but at the same time takes into\naccount the decision of the majority is preferred. Thus we propose an Anonymous\nEndorsement System which uses a threshold endorsement policy in order to\naddress the issue. All these factors motivated us to design a new ring\nsignature scheme, called Fabric' Constant-Sized Linkable Ring Signature\n(FCsLRS) with Transaction-Oriented linkability for hiding identity of the\nendorsers. We have implemented the signature scheme in Golang and analyzed its\nsecurity and performance by varying the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) modulus\nsize. Feasibility of implementation is supported by experimental analysis.\nSignature and tag generation time is quite fast and remains constant\nirrespective of change in message length or endorsement set size for a given\nRSA modulus value, assuming all the endorsers generates their signature in\nparallel. Lastly, we also discuss the integration of the scheme on v1.2\nHyperledger Fabric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 18:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:47:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 06:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 03:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 14:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-06"}

One of the\nmain noise sources of atomic magnetometers comes from the light shift that\ndepends on the frequency of the pump laser. In this work, we theoretically\nstudy the light shift, taking into account the relaxation due to the optical\npumping and the collision between alkali atoms and between alkali atoms and the\nbuffer gas. Starting from a full master equation containing both the ground and\nexcited states, we adiabatically eliminate the excited states and obtain an\neffective master equation in the ground-state subspace that shows an intuitive\npicture and dramatically accelerates the numerical simulation. Solving this\neffective master equation, we find that in the light-narrowing regime, where\nthe line width is reduced while the coherent precession signal is enhanced, the\nfrequency-dependence of the light shift is largely reduced, which agrees with\nexperimental observations in cesium magnetometers.

First, previous mining methods assign one binary score to each\nsample, i.e., dropping or keeping it, so they only selects a subset of relevant\nsamples in a mini-batch. Therefore, we propose a novel sample mining method,\ncalled Online Soft Mining (OSM), which assigns one continuous score to each\nsample to make use of all samples in the mini-batch. OSM learns extended\nmanifolds that preserve useful intraclass variances by focusing on more similar\npositives. Second, the existing methods are easily influenced by outliers as\nthey are generally included in the mined subset. To address this, we introduce\nClass-Aware Attention (CAA) that assigns little attention to abnormal data\nsamples. Furthermore, by combining OSM and CAA, we propose a novel weighted\ncontrastive loss to learn discriminative embeddings.

To illustrate the security vulnerabilities of ML during\ntraining, inferencing and hardware implementation, we demonstrate some key\nsecurity threats on ML using LeNet and VGGNet for MNIST and German Traffic Sign\nRecognition Benchmarks (GTSRB), respectively. Moreover, based on the security\nanalysis of ML-training, we also propose an attack that has a very less impact\non the inference accuracy. Towards the end, we highlight the associated\nresearch challenges in developing security measures and provide a brief\noverview of the techniques used to mitigate such security threats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 00:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

We find\nthat the QCD correction enhances the LO differential cross section\nsignificantly, while the EW correction from the $q\\bar{q}$ annihilation channel\nobviously suppresses the LO differential cross section, especially in the high\nenergy phase-space region due to the Sudakov effect. The $q\\gamma$- and\n$\\gamma\\gamma$-induced relative corrections are positive, and insensitive to\nthe transverse momenta of $W^{\\pm}$, $H$ and their decay products. These\nphoton-induced corrections compensate the negative $q\\bar{q}$-initiated EW\ncorrection, and become the dominant EW contribution as the increment of the\n$pp$ colliding energy. The parton shower (PS) effects on the kinematic\ndistributions are nonnegligible. The PS relative correction to the $b$-jet\ntransverse momentum distribution can exceed $100\\%$ in the high $p_{T, b}$\nregion. We also investigate the scale and PDF uncertainties, and find that the\ntheoretical error of the ${\\rm QCD}+{\\rm EW}+q\\gamma+\\gamma\\gamma$ corrected\nintegrated cross section mainly comes from the renormalization scale dependence\nof the QCD correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 03:17:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 05:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

The aim of the present work is to pursue a method alternative\nto canonical quantization that avoids these dfficulties. In order to guarantee\nthis result, the present approach is constrained to be developed deductively\nfrom physical principles. The physical principles assumed for a free particle\nconsist of the symmetry properties of the particle with respect to the\nPoincar\\'e group and of the transformation properties of the position\nobservable, expressed by means of a suitably conceived notion of quantum\ntransformation. In so doing, the effectiveness of group theoretical methods is\nexploited. Our work has pointed out the necessity of new classes of irreducible\nrepresentations of the Poincar\\'e group the theory can be based on. For spin 0\nparticle, four inequivalent theories are completely determined, that differ\nfrom Klein-Gordon theory for the physical interpretation but also for the\nmathematical structures. In particular, two of these theories requires\nirreducible representations in the new classes. The present lack of the\nexplicit transformation properties of position with respect to boosts forbids\nthe complete determination of non zero spin particle theories. A particular\nform of these transformation properties was in past adopted by Jordan and\nMukunda. We check its consistency within the present approach; it is found that\nfor spin 1/2 particles there is only one consistent theory; it is unitarily\nrelated to Dirac theory, but, once again, it requires the new classes of\nirreducible representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 08:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

A sequential evolution of multiple generations of\nstars formed over 100-200 million years is a natural explanation of this colour\nspread^{12}.

However, its effectiveness has not yet been\nproven due to the lack of direct measurements of rotational velocities. Here we\nreport the distribution of projected rotational velocities (V sin i) of stars\nin the Galactic open cluster M11, measured through a Fourier transform\nanalysis. Cluster members display a broad V sin i distribution, and fast\nrotators including Be stars have redder colours than slow rotators. Monte Carlo\nsimulations infer that cluster members have highly aligned spin axes and a\nbroad distribution of equatorial velocities biased towards high velocities.

By assuming a radially symmetrical flow\nfield, the applied analysis method determines the radial dependence of the\nazimuthally averaged flow field. For comparison, we studied the flow in\nsupergranules using the same technique. All investigated, fully fledged\nsunspots are surrounded by a flow field whose horizontal velocity profile\ndecreases continuously from 881 m s$^{-1}$ at 1.1 Mm off the spot boundary,\ndown to 199 m s$^{-1}$ at a mean distance of 11.9 Mm to that boundary. Once the\npenumbra is fully dissolved, however, the velocity profile of the flow changes:\nThe horizontal velocity increases with increasing distance to the spot boundary\nuntil a maximum value of about 398 m s$^{-1}$ is reached. Then, the horizontal\nvelocity decreases for farther distances to the spot boundary. In\nsupergranules, the horizontal velocity increases with increasing distance to\ntheir centre up to a mean maximum velocity of 355 m s$^{-1}$. For larger\ndistances, the horizontal velocity decreases. We thus find that the velocity\nprofile of naked sunspots resembles that of supergranular flows. The evolution\nof the flow field around individual sunspots is influenced by the way the\nsunspot decays and by the interplay with the surrounding flow areas.\nObservations of the flow around eight decaying sunspots suggest that as long as\npenumbrae are present, sunspots with their moat cell are embedded in network\ncells. The disappearance of the penumbra (and consequently the moat flow) and\nthe competing surrounding supergranular cells, both have a significant role in\nthe evolution of the flow field: The moat cell transforms into a supergranule,\nwhich hosts the remaining naked spot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 10:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

The transition between the\nregimes occurs at the load which depends on the second and the fourth spectral\nmoments.

Whereas up to now these two types of tax processes have been\ntreated separately, we show that, in fact, they are essentially equivalent.\nThis allows a unified treatment, translating results from one model to the\nother. Significantly, we solve the question of existence and uniqueness for the\nnatural tax process, which is defined via an integral equation. Our results\nclarify the existing literature on processes with tax.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 13:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 15:34:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 12:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

By \"rational\", we mean\n(1) efficient path planning to eliminate first-move lags; (2) collision-free\nand smooth for agents with kinematic constraints satisfied. SG-RL works in a\ntwo-level manner. At the first level, SG-RL uses a geometric path-planning\nmethod, i.e., Simple Subgoal Graphs (SSG), to efficiently find optimal abstract\npaths, also called subgoal sequences. At the second level, SG-RL uses an RL\nmethod, i.e., Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI), to learn near-optimal\nmotion-planning policies which can generate kinematically feasible and\ncollision-free trajectories between adjacent subgoals. The first advantage of\nthe proposed method is that SSG can solve the limitations of sparse reward and\nlocal minima trap for RL agents; thus, LSPI can be used to generate paths in\ncomplex environments. The second advantage is that, when the environment\nchanges slightly (i.e., unexpected obstacles appearing), SG-RL does not need to\nreconstruct subgoal graphs and replan subgoal sequences using SSG, since LSPI\ncan deal with uncertainties by exploiting its generalization ability to handle\nchanges in environments. Simulation experiments in representative scenarios\ndemonstrate that, compared with existing methods, SG-RL can work well on\nlarge-scale maps with relatively low action-switching frequencies and shorter\npath lengths, and SG-RL can deal with small changes in environments. We further\ndemonstrate that the design of reward functions and the types of training\nenvironments are important factors for learning feasible policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 14:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

Quantization can\nsignificantly reduce DNN computation and storage by decreasing the bitwidth of\nnetwork encodings. Recent research affirms that carefully selecting the\nquantization levels for each layer can preserve the accuracy while pushing the\nbitwidth below eight bits. However, without arduous manual effort, this deep\nquantization can lead to significant accuracy loss, leaving it in a position of\nquestionable utility. As such, deep quantization opens a large hyper-parameter\nspace (bitwidth of the layers), the exploration of which is a major challenge.\nWe propose a systematic approach to tackle this problem, by automating the\nprocess of discovering the quantization levels through an end-to-end deep\nreinforcement learning framework (ReLeQ). We adapt policy optimization methods\nto the problem of quantization, and focus on finding the best design decisions\nin choosing the state and action spaces, network architecture and training\nframework, as well as the tuning of various hyperparamters. We show how ReLeQ\ncan balance speed and quality, and provide an asymmetric general solution for\nquantization of a large variety of deep networks (AlexNet, CIFAR-10, LeNet,\nMobileNet-V1, ResNet-20, SVHN, and VGG-11) that virtually preserves the\naccuracy (=< 0.3% loss) while minimizing the computation and storage cost. With\nthese DNNs, ReLeQ enables conventional hardware to achieve 2.2x speedup over\n8-bit execution. Similarly, a custom DNN accelerator achieves 2.0x speedup and\nenergy reduction compared to 8-bit runs. These encouraging results mark ReLeQ\nas the initial step towards automating the deep quantization of neural\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 14:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 23:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 02:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

We also demonstrate that agents\nequipped with our meta-world model possess the ability of visual\nself-recognition, i.e., recognize themselves from the reflected mirrored\nenvironment derived from the classic mirror self-recognition test (MSR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 14:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

We propose a method to obtain\nrobust features in unsupervised learning tasks against adversarial attacks. Our\nmethod differs from existing solutions by directly learning the robust features\nwithout the need to project the adversarial examples in the original examples\ndistribution space. A first auto-encoder A1 is in charge of perturbing the\ninput image to fool another auto-encoder A2 which is in charge of regenerating\nthe original image. A1 tries to find the less perturbed image under the\nconstraint that the error in the output of A2 should be at least equal to a\nthreshold. Thanks to this training, the encoder of A2 will be robust against\nadversarial attacks and could be used in different tasks like classification.\nUsing state-of-art network architectures, we demonstrate the robustness of the\nfeatures obtained thanks to this method in classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 14:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

Arrays of thousands of antennas are\nnow envisioned for the detection of cosmic rays of ultra high energy or\nneutrinos of astrophysical origin. The data exploitation of such detectors\nrequires to run massive air-shower simulations to evaluate the radio signal at\neach antenna position. In order to reduce the associated computational cost, we\nhave developed a semi-analytical method for the computation of the emitted\nradio signal called Radio Morphing. The method consists in computing the radio\nsignal of any air-shower at any location from the simulation of one single\nreference shower at given positions by i) a scaling of the electric-field\namplitude of this reference shower, ii) an isometry on the simulated positions\nand iii) an interpolation of the radio pulse at the desired position. This\ntechnique enables one to compute electric field time traces with\ncharacteristics very similar to those obtained with standard computation\nmethods, but with computation times reduced by several orders of magnitude. In\nthis paper, we present this novel tool, explain its methodology, and discuss\nits limitations. Furthermore, we validate the method on a typical event set for\nthe future GRAND experiment showing that the calculated peak amplitudes are\nconsistent with the results from ZHAireS simulations with a mean offset of\n+8.5% and a standard deviation of 27.2% in this specific case.

The GDV can be used for the\nautomatic tuning of hyper-parameters, such as the width profile and the total\ndepth of a network.

Previous biologically\nplausible reinforcement learning rules, like AGREL and AuGMEnT, showed\npromising results but focused on shallow networks with three layers. Will these\nlearning rules also generalize to networks with more layers and can they handle\ntasks of higher complexity? We demonstrate the learning scheme on classical and\nhard image-classification benchmarks, namely MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, cast\nas direct reward tasks, both for fully connected, convolutional and locally\nconnected architectures. We show that our learning rule - Q-AGREL - performs\ncomparably to supervised learning via error-backpropagation, with this type of\ntrial-and-error reinforcement learning requiring only 1.5-2.5 times more\nepochs, even when classifying 100 different classes as in CIFAR100.

In this paper, we study adversarial\nmachine learning in the form of back-box attacks on online classifier APIs. We\nstart with a deep learning based exploratory (inference) attack, which aims to\nbuild a classifier that can provide similar classification results (labels) as\nthe target classifier. To minimize the difference between the labels returned\nby the inferred classifier and the target classifier, we show that the deep\nlearning based exploratory attack requires a large number of labeled training\ndata samples. These labels can be collected by calling the online API, but\nusually there is some strict rate limitation on the number of allowed API\ncalls. To mitigate the impact of limited training data, we develop an active\nlearning approach that first builds a classifier based on a small number of API\ncalls and uses this classifier to select samples to further collect their\nlabels. Then, a new classifier is built using more training data samples. This\nupdating process can be repeated multiple times. We show that this active\nlearning approach can build an adversarial classifier with a small statistical\ndifference from the target classifier using only a limited number of training\ndata samples. We further consider evasion and causative (poisoning) attacks\nbased on the inferred classifier that is built by the exploratory attack.\nEvasion attack determines samples that the target classifier is likely to\nmisclassify, whereas causative attack provides erroneous training data samples\nto reduce the reliability of the re-trained classifier.

The radii of these stars, in particular, are sensitive to the\ndetails of inefficient, super-adiabatic convection occurring in their outermost\nlayers. The standard treatment of convection in stellar evolution models, based\non the Mixing-Length Theory (MLT), provides only a very approximate description\nof convection in the super-adiabatic regime. Moreover, it contains a free\nparameter, alpha_MLT, whose standard calibration is based on the Sun, and is\nroutinely applied to other stars ignoring the differences in their global\nparameters (e.g., effective temperature, gravity, chemical composition) and\nprevious evolutionary history. In this paper, we present a calibration of\nalpha_MLT based on three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics (3D RHD)\nsimulations of convection. The value of alpha_MLT is adjusted to match the\nspecific entropy in the deep, adiabatic layers of the convective envelope to\nthe corresponding value obtained from the 3D RHD simulations, as a function of\nthe position of the star in the (log g, log T_eff) plane and its chemical\ncomposition. We have constructed a model of the present-day Sun using such\nentropy-based calibration. We find that its past luminosity evolution is not\naffected by the entropy calibration. The predicted solar radius, however,\nexceeds that of the standard model during the past several billion years,\nresulting in a lower surface temperature.

Absence of any significant difference in the\nstructure of the networks may indicate towards the possibility of a universal\nstructural pattern in these ecological networks. The underlying graphs of the\nnetworks derived by the ecological processes, namely host-parasite interaction,\nplant pollination and seed dispersion are all bipartite graphs and thus several\nalgebraic structural measures fail to distinguish between the structure of\nthese networks. In this work we use weighted spectral distribution (WSD) of\nnormalized graph Laplacian, which have been effectively used earlier to\ndiscriminate graphs with different topologies, to investigate the possibility\nof existence of structural dissimilarity in these networks. Graph spectrum is\noften considered a signature of the graph and WSD of the graph Laplacian is\nshown to be related to the distribution of some small subgraphs in a graph and\nhence represent the global structure of a network.We use random projections of\nWSD to $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and establish that the structure\nof plant pollinator networks is significantly different as compared to\nhost-parasite and seed dispersal networks.

Languages and\nsimulation tools for modeling such systems differ in syntax, informal\nsemantics, and in the methods by which such systems of equations are generated\nand simulated, leading to numerous interoperability challenges. Logical\nextensions of SysML aim specially at unifying a subset of the underlying\nconcepts in such languages. We propose to unify semantics of all such systems\nusing standard notions from algebraic topology. In particular, Tonti diagrams\nclassify all physical theories in terms of physical laws (topological and\nconstitutive) defined over a pair of dual cochain complexes and may be used to\ndescribe different types of lumped parameter systems. We show that all possible\nmethods for generating the corresponding state equations within each physical\ndomain correspond to paths over Tonti diagrams. We further propose a\ngeneralization of Tonti diagram that captures the behavior and supports\ncanonical generation of state equations for multi-domain lumped parameter\nsystems. The unified semantics provides a basis for greater interoperability in\nsystems modeling, supporting automated translation, integration, reuse, and\nnumerical simulation of models created in different authoring systems and\napplications. Notably, the proposed algebraic topological semantics is also\ncompatible with spatially and temporally distributed models that are at the\ncore of modern CAD and CAE systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 22:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

Surprisingly,\nhowever, little progress has been made on addressing this problem for time\nseries subsequences. In this thesis, we have introduced a near universal time\nseries data mining tool called matrix profile which solves the\nall-pairs-similarity-search problem and caches the output in an easy-to-access\nfashion. The proposed algorithm is not only parameter-free, exact and scalable,\nbut also applicable for both single and multidimensional time series. By\nbuilding time series data mining methods on top of matrix profile, many time\nseries data mining tasks (e.g., motif discovery, discord discovery, shapelet\ndiscovery, semantic segmentation, and clustering) can be efficiently solved.\nBecause the same matrix profile can be shared by a diverse set of time series\ndata mining methods, matrix profile is versatile and\ncomputed-once-use-many-times data structure. We demonstrate the utility of\nmatrix profile for many time series data mining problems, including motif\ndiscovery, discord discovery, weakly labeled time series classification, and\nrepresentation learning on domains as diverse as seismology, entomology, music\nprocessing, bioinformatics, human activity monitoring, electrical power-demand\nmonitoring, and medicine.

Most experimenters have for decades been unaware of\nthis fact. Consequently, the reported creep curves require correction by a time\nshift, which ranges from 0 to 2 hours. This further implies a vertical shift of\nentire creep curve, important for all times up to structure lifetime. To filter\nout the errors, it is argued that, within an initial period during which the\nadvance of hydration is negligible, which is normally about 1 day, the initial\nbasic creep must follow a power law of the time. Creep test data from the\nliterature are used to prove it. Corrections by time and deformation shifts are\ndetermined by minimization of the sum of squared deviations of the power law\nfrom the creep test data. For a fixed exponent n and time shift s, the\noptimization is reduced to linear regressions of two kinds, depending on\nwhether the data are given in terms of either the compliance function or the\ncreep coefficient. For both, the linear regression parameters depend\nnonlinearly on the chosen values of n and s. To avoid nonlinear optimization,\nwhich need not converge to the correct result, a set of many discrete values of\nn and s within their realistic ranges is selected and the (n,s) combination\nminimizing the objective function is obtained by a search. Enforcing a power\nlaw form of the initial creep curve is found to lead to better data fits. The\noptimum exponent n for the entire database is around 0.3, applicable to the\ntime period cca (10 s, 1 day). After that, the exponent transits to about 0.1,\nand prior to that it is about 0.08.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 17:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

In particular, almost all the proposed side-channel\npower-based detection techniques presume that HTs are detectable because they\nonly add gates to the original circuit with a noticeable increase in power\nconsumption. This paper demonstrates how undetectable HTs can be realized with\nzero impact on the power and area footprint of the original circuit. Towards\nthis, we propose a novel concept of TrojanZero and a systematic methodology for\ndesigning undetectable HTs in the circuits, which conceals their existence by\ngate-level modifications. The crux is to salvage the cost of the HT from the\noriginal circuit without being detected using standard testing techniques. Our\nmethodology leverages the knowledge of transition probabilities of the circuit\nnodes to identify and safely remove expendable gates, and embeds malicious\ncircuitry at the appropriate locations with zero power and area overheads when\ncompared to the original circuit. We synthesize these designs and then embed in\nmultiple ISCAS85 benchmarks using a 65nm technology library, and perform a\ncomprehensive power and area characterization. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed TrojanZero designs are undetectable by the\nstate-of-the-art power-based detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 10:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a novel methodology based on model checking to\nformally analyze security vulnerabilities in sequential circuits while\nconsidering side-channel parameters like propagation delay, switching power,\nand leakage power. In particular, we present a novel algorithm to efficiently\npartition the state-space into corresponding smaller state-spaces to enable\ndistributed security analysis of complex sequential circuits and thereby\nmitigating the associated state-space explosion due to their feedback loops. We\nanalyze multiple ISCAS89 and trust-hub benchmarks to demonstrate the efficacy\nof our framework in identifying security vulnerabilities. The experimental\nresults show that ForASec successfully performs the complete analysis of the\ngiven complex and large sequential circuits, and provides approximately 11x to\n16x speedup in analysis time compared to state-of-the-art model checking-based\ntechniques. Moreover, it also identifies the number of gates required by an HT\nthat can go undetected for a given design and variability conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 00:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:51:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 11:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

We present a run-time methodology for HT detection\nthat employs a multi-parameter statistical traffic modeling of the\ncommunication channel in a given System-on-Chip (SoC), named as SIMCom. The\nmain idea is to model the communication using multiple side-channel information\nlike the Hurst exponent, the standard deviation of the injection distribution,\nand the hop distribution jointly to accurately identify HT-based online\nanomalies (that affects the communication without affecting the protocols or\ncontrol signals). At design time, our methodology employs a \"property\nspecification language\" to define and embed assertions in the RTL, specifying\nthe correct communication behavior of a given SoC. At run-time, it monitors the\nanomalies in the communication behavior by checking the execution patterns\nagainst these assertions. For illustration, we evaluate SIMCom for three SoCs,\ni.e., SoC1 ( four single-core MC8051 and UART modules), SoC2 (four single-core\nMC8051, AES, ethernet, memctrl, BasicRSA, RS232 modules), and SoC3 (four\nsingle-core LEON3 connected with each other and AES, ethernet, memctrl,\nBasicRSA, RS23s modules microcontrollers). The experimental results show that\nwith the combined analysis of multiple statistical parameters, SIMCom is able\nto detect all the benchmark Trojans (available on trust-hub) with less than 1%\narea and power overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2018 22:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:36:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 20:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}
