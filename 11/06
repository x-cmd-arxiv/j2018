In optics, Pancharatnam-Berry phase allows the\ntailoring of optical beams by a local control of their polarization. Here we\ndiscuss light propagation in the presence of an intensity-dependent local\nmodulation of the Pancharatnam-Berry phase. The corresponding self-modulation\nof the wavefront counteracts the natural spreading due to diffraction, i.e.,\nself-focusing takes place. No refractive index variation is associated with the\nself-focusing: the confinement is uniquely due to a nonlinear spin-orbit\ninteraction. The phenomenon is investigated, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, considering the reorientational nonlinearity in liquid\ncrystals, where light is able to rotate the local optical axis through an\nintensity-dependent optical torque. Our discoveries pave the way to the\ninvestigation of a new family of nonlinear waves featuring a strong interaction\nbetween the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 16:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

This enables to\ntrace down the owner of a video sequence, which proves extremely helpful to\nsolve copyright infringement cases as well as to fight distribution of illicit\nmaterial (e.g., underage clips, terroristic threats, etc.). Currently, the most\npromising methods to tackle this task exploit unique noise traces left by\ncamera sensors on acquired images. However, given the recent advancements in\nmotion stabilization of video content, robustness of sensor pattern noise-based\ntechniques are strongly hindered. Indeed, video stabilization introduces\ngeometric transformations between video frames, thus making camera fingerprint\nestimation problematic with classical approaches. In this paper, we deal with\nthe challenging problem of attributing stabilized videos to their recording\ndevice. Specifically, we propose: (i) a strategy to extract the characteristic\nfingerprint of a device, starting from either a set of images or stabilized\nvideo sequences; (ii) a strategy to match a stabilized video sequence with a\ngiven fingerprint in order to solve the device attribution problem. The\nproposed methodology is tested on videos coming from a set of different\nsmartphones, taken from the modern publicly available Vision Dataset. The\nconducted experiments also provide an interesting insight on the effect of\nmodern smartphones video stabilization algorithms on specific video frames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 16:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

The\nhistory part is smooth, easily discretized using high-order quadratures, and\nstraightforward to compute using a variety of fast algorithms.

The authors assert that: (1) the TSSE, in general, has not been\ncompletely proven so far, and that the existing theories, in particular the\nphonon magnon drag model that we have used in our publication, in fact cannot\nexplain the original work of Uchida et al. (2) The commenters based their\ncritique on an estimate of the magnitude of the measured effect, arguing that\nto observe the TSSE that we originally claimed, the temperature gradient in our\nmeasurements should have been much larger than the value we measured. In this\nReply, firstly, we summarize previous literature reports on the TSSE response\nin FM metallic systems. Secondly, we dispute the estimate of the necessary\nlarge temperature gradient made by the commenters. Importantly, the Kerr effect\nsensitivity to spin accumulation (via the TSSE response) has not been\nrecognized by the commenters, in fact it was mistakenly assumed that the Kerr\neffect sensitivity to the spin accumulation by the TSSE is the same as the Kerr\nsensitivity to the bulk magnetization change due to the temperature change. In\nconclusion, we show that the TSSE is the only viable interpretation of our\noriginal measurements, and that the phonon-magnon drag model is indeed capable\nof explaining our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 17:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Here we consider water confined in\nstacked membranes with hydration from poor to complete, as observed in a number\nof biological systems. Experiments show that the dynamics of water slows down\ndramatically when the hydration level is reduced. All-atom molecular dynamics\nsimulations identify three (inner, hydration and outer) regions, within a\ndistance of approximately 1 nm from the membrane, where water molecules exhibit\ndifferent degrees of slowing down in the dynamics. The slow-down is a\nconsequence of the robustness of the hydrogen bonds between water and lipids\nand the long lifetime of the hydrogen bonds between water molecules near the\nmembrane. The interaction with the interface, therefore, induces a structural\nchange in the water that can be emphasized by calculating its intermediate\nrange order. Surprisingly, at distances as far as ~ 2.5 nm from the interface,\nalthough the bulk-like dynamics is recovered, the intermediate range order of\nwater is still slightly higher than that in the bulk at the same thermodynamic\nconditions. Therefore, the water-membrane interface has a structural effect at\nambient conditions that propagates further than the often-invoked 1 nm length\nscale. Membrane fluctuations smear out this effect macroscopically, but an\nanalysis performed by considering local distances and instantaneous\nconfigurations is able to reveal it, possibly contributing to our understanding\nof the role of water at biomembrane interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 18:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 20:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 15:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-16"}

We run two cosmological simulations of the same galaxy halo, once with a\nsimple 'no feedback' model, and separately with a more comprehensive physical\nmodel including galactic-scale outflows as in the Illustris simulation. Our\nchosen halo has a total mass of ~10^12 Msun at z ~ 2, and we achieve a median\ngas mass (spatial) resolution of ~2,200 solar masses (~95 parsecs) in the CGM,\nsix-hundred (fourteen) times better than in the Illustris-1 simulation, a\nhigher spatial resolution than any cosmological simulation at this mass scale\nto date. We explore the primary channel(s) of cold-phase CGM gas production in\nthis regime. We find that winds substantially enhance the amount of cold gas in\nthe halo, also evidenced in the covering fractions of HI and the equivalent\nwidths of MgII out to large radii, in better agreement with observations than\nthe case without galactic winds. Using a tracer particle analysis to follow the\nthermodynamic history of gas, we demonstrate how the majority of this cold,\ndense gas arises due to rapid cooling of the wind material interacting with the\nhot halo, and how large amounts of cold, ~10^4 K gas can be produced and\npersist in galactic halos with Tvir ~ 10^6 K.

This leads to a\ncancellation of zero point energies in the 4D field theory but a split mass\nspectrum for superpartners of order $\\Delta m_\\text{4D} \\sim \\sqrt{M_\\text{IR}\nM_\\text{UV}}$ specified by the IR and UV cutoffs of the model. This is\nsuggestively close to the TeV scale in some scenarios. The classical 4D\ngeometry has an intrinsic instability which can produce either a collapsing or\nexpanding Universe, the latter providing a promising starting point for a\nnumber of cosmological scenarios. The resulting 1D quantum mechanics in the\ntime direction also provides an appealing starting point for a more detailed\nstudy of quantum cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 18:21:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 18:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

The recent\nidentification of a significant population of galaxies with large sizes but low\nluminosities (\"ultra diffuse galaxies\", or UDGs) raises the question whether\nthe inverse is also true, that is, whether large galaxies typically have high\nluminosities. Here we address this question by studying a size-limited sample\nof galaxies in the Coma cluster. We select red cluster galaxies with sizes\n$r_{\\mathrm{eff}} > 2 \\ \\mathrm{kpc}$ down to $M_{g} \\sim -13 \\ \\mathrm{mag}$\nin an area of $9 \\ \\mathrm{deg}^2$, using carefully-filtered CFHT images.

The\nnumber of galaxies within $\\pm 0.5$ magnitudes of the canonical peak ($M_g =\n-19.69$ for $2<r_{\\mathrm{eff}}<3$ kpc) is a factor of $\\sim 9$ smaller than\nthe number of fainter galaxies with $-19<M_g<-13$. Large, faint galaxies such\nas UDGs are far more common than large galaxies that are on the size-luminosity\nrelation. An implication is that, for large galaxies, size is not an indicator\nof halo mass. Finally, we show that the structure of faint large galaxies is\ndifferent from that of bright large galaxies: at fixed large size, the S\\'ersic\nindex decreases with magnitude following the relation $\\log_{10} n \\approx\n-0.067M_g-0.989$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

In Paper I we presented a method of finding candidate\nkpc-scale galaxy mergers that is leveraged on the selection of X-ray sources\nspatially offset from the centers of host galaxies. In this paper we analyze\nnew Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 imaging for six of these sources to\nsearch for signatures of galaxy mergers. The HST imaging reveals that four of\nthe six systems are on-going galaxy mergers with separations of 1.2-6.6 kpc\n(offset AGN). The nature of the remaining two spatially offset X-ray sources is\nambiguous and may be associated with super-Eddington accretion in X-ray\nbinaries. The ability of this sample to probe small galaxy separations and\nminor mergers makes it uniquely suited for testing the role of galaxy mergers\nfor AGN triggering. We find that galaxy mergers with only one AGN are\npredominantly minor mergers with mass ratios similar to the overall population\nof galaxy mergers. By comparison, galaxy mergers with two AGN are biased toward\nmajor mergers and larger nuclear gas masses. Finally, we find that the level of\nSMBH accretion increases toward smaller mass ratios (major mergers). This\nresult suggests the mass ratio effects not only the frequency of AGN triggering\nbut also the rate of SMBH growth in mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 19:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

In particular, the D- and B-meson measurements of LHCb at forward\ndirection are sensitive to gluon dynamics at small $x$ and are one of the few\nperturbative small-$x$ probes before the next generation\ndeep-inelastic-scattering experiments. In this talk, we will concentrate on the\ncollinear-factorization approach to inclusive D-meson production and describe a\nnovel implementation - SACOT-$m_{\\rm T}$ - of the general-mass variable flavour\nnumber scheme (GM-VFNS). In the GM-VFNS framework the cross sections retain the\nfull heavy-quark mass dependence at $p_{\\rm T}=0$, but gradually reduce to the\nordinary zero-mass results towards asymptotically high $p_{\\rm T}$. However,\nthe region of small (but non-zero) $p_{\\rm T}$ has been somewhat problematic in\nthe previous implementations of GM-VFNS, leading to divergent cross sections\ntowards $p_{\\rm T} \\rightarrow 0$, unless the QCD scales are set in a\nparticular way. Here, we provide a solution to this problem. In essence, the\nidea is to consistently account for the underlying energy-momentum conservation\nin the presence of a final-state heavy quark-antiquark pair. This automatically\nleads to a well-behaved GM-VFNS description of the cross sections across all\n$p_{\\rm T}$ without a need to fine tune the QCD scales. The results are\ncompared with the LHCb data and a very good agreement is found.

As a consequence of its achievements, a relevant question is whether\nits model parameters can somehow be related to fundamental constants of QCD. We\nshall give a first answer in this article by comparing the predictions of both\napproaches. Building on results from a previous study on heavy meson\nspectroscopy, we calibrate the Cornell model employing NRQCD predictions for\nthe lowest-lying bottomonium states up to N$^3$LO, in which the bottom mass is\nvaried within a wide range. We find that the Cornell model mass parameter can\nbe identified, within perturbative uncertainties, with the MSR mass at the\nscale $R = 1\\,$GeV. This identification holds for any value of $\\alpha_s$ or\nthe bottom mass, and for all perturbative orders investigated. Furthermore, we\nshow that: a) the \"string tension\" parameter is independent of the bottom mass,\nand b) the Coulomb strength $\\kappa$ of the Cornell model can be related to the\nQCD strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$ at a characteristic non-relativistic\nscale. We also show how to remove the $u=1/2$ renormalon of the static QCD\npotential and sum-up large logs related to the renormalon subtraction by\nswitching to the low-scale, short-distance MSR mass, and using R-evolution. Our\nR-improved expression for the static potential remains independent of the heavy\nquark mass value and agrees with lattice QCD results for values of the radius\nas large as $0.8\\,$fm, and with the Cornell model potential at long distances.\nFinally we show that for moderate values of $r$, the R-improved NRQCD and\nCornell static potentials are in head-on agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 19:03:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 10:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power\nsystem and can lead to a blackout. On the other hand, existing charging\ncoordination mechanisms suffer from several limitations. First, the need for a\ncentral charging coordinator (CC) presents a single point of failure that\njeopardizes the effectiveness of the charging coordination. Second, a\ntransparent charging coordination mechanism does not exist where users are not\naware whether the CC is honest or not in coordination charging requests among\nthem in a fair way. Third, existing mechanisms overlook the privacy concerns of\nthe involved customers. To address these limitations, in this paper, we\nleverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging\ncoordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator.\nFirst ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the\nblockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its\nState-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required\ncharging to the smart contract address on the blockchain.

Our data shows how the high\ncadence of NGTS can be used to apply solar techniques to stellar flares and\nidentify potential causes of the observed oscillations. We also discuss the\nimplications of this flare for the habitability of planets around M star hosts\nand how NGTS can aid in our understanding of this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 19:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The output end of the PMA--FM\nforms the free layer of an MTJ stack. A spin Hall metal (SHM) is placed beneath\nthe PMA-FM.

We extend the theory of graph limits to the ordered\nsetting, presenting a limit object for dense vertex-ordered graphs, which we\ncall an \\emph{orderon}. As a special case, this yields limit objects for\nmatrices whose rows and columns are ordered, and for dynamic graphs that expand\n(via vertex insertions) over time. Along the way, we devise an ordered\nlocality-preserving variant of the cut distance between ordered graphs, showing\nthat two graphs are close with respect to this distance if and only if they are\nsimilar in terms of their ordered subgraph frequencies.

These simulations have now clarified the\norigin of these galaxy scaling laws in a universe dominated by cold dark\nmatter: these relations arise from the tight (but highly non-linear) relations\nbetween (i) galaxy mass and halo mass, (ii) galaxy size and halo characteristic\nradius; and (iii) from the self-similar mass nature of cold dark matter halo\nmass profiles.

Recent studies show that developers spend most of their programming\ntime testing, verifying and debugging software. As applications become more and\nmore complex, developers demand more advanced debugging support to ease the\nsoftware development process.\n  Inquiry. Since the 70's many debugging solutions were introduced. Amongst\nthem, online debuggers provide a good insight on the conditions that led to a\nbug, allowing inspection and interaction with the variables of the program.\nHowever, most of the online debugging solutions introduce \\textit{debugging\ninterference} to the execution of the program, i.e. pauses, latency, and\nevaluation of code containing side-effects.\n  Approach. This paper investigates a novel debugging technique called\n\\outofplace debugging. The goal is to minimize the debugging interference\ncharacteristic of online debugging while allowing online remote capabilities.\nAn \\outofplace debugger transfers the program execution and application state\nfrom the debugged application to the debugger application, both running in\ndifferent processes.\n  Knowledge. On the one hand, \\outofplace debugging allows developers to debug\napplications remotely, overcoming the need of physical access to the machine\nwhere the debugged application is running. On the other hand, debugging happens\nlocally on the remote machine avoiding latency. That makes it suitable to be\ndeployed on a distributed system and handle the debugging of several processes\nrunning in parallel.\n  Grounding. We implemented a concrete out-of-place debugger for the Pharo\nSmalltalk programming language. We show that our approach is practical by\nperforming several benchmarks, comparing our approach with a classic remote\nonline debugger. We show that our prototype debugger outperforms by a 1000\ntimes a traditional remote debugger in several scenarios. Moreover, we show\nthat the presence of our debugger does not impact the overall performance of an\napplication.\n  Importance. This work combines remote debugging with the debugging experience\nof a local online debugger. Out-of-place debugging is the first online\ndebugging technique that can minimize debugging interference while debugging a\nremote application. Yet, it still keeps the benefits of online debugging ( e.g.\nstep-by-step execution). This makes the technique suitable for modern\napplications which are increasingly parallel, distributed and reactive to\nstreams of data from various sources like sensors, UI, network, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 21:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

For typical ULX\nmass accretion rates ($\\gtrsim 10^{19}\\,{\\rm g\\,s^{-1}}$), the inner parts of\nthe accretion disc are expected to be in the supercritical regime, meaning that\nsome material is lost in a wind launched from the disc surface, while the rest\nforms an optically thick envelope around the NS as it follows magnetic field\nlines from the inner disc radius to the magnetic poles of the star. The\nenvelope hides the central object from a distant observer and defines key\nobservational properties of ULX pulsars: their energy spectrum, polarization,\nand timing features. The optical thickness of the envelope is affected by the\nmass losses from the disc. We calculate the mass loss rate due to the wind in\nULX pulsars, accounting for the NS magnetic field strength and advection\nprocesses in the disc. We argue that the detection of strong outflows from ULX\npulsars can be considered evidence of a relatively weak dipole component of the\nNS magnetic field. We estimate the influence of mass losses on the optical\nthickness of the envelope and analyze how the envelope affects broadband\naperiodic variability in ULXs.

By employing a single-node non-partitioned architecture\nfor some replicas and a partitioned architecture for other replicas, STAR is\nable to efficiently run both highly partitionable workloads and workloads that\ninvolve cross-partition transactions. The key idea is a new phase-switching\nalgorithm where the execution of single-partition and cross-partition\ntransactions is separated. In the partitioned phase, single-partition\ntransactions are run on multiple machines in parallel to exploit more\nconcurrency.

In this paper, we\ndesign a new succinct rank data structure with $r=n/(\\log\nn)^{\\Omega(t)}+n^{1-c}$ and query time $O(t)$ for some constant $c>0$,\nimproving the previous best-known by Patrascu [Pat08], which has\n$r=n/(\\frac{\\log n}{t})^{\\Omega(t)}+\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ bits of redundancy.

Moreover, one can avoid an $n^{1-c}$-bit lookup table when the data\nstructure is implemented in the cell-probe model, achieving $r=\\lceil n/(\\log\nn)^{\\Omega(t)}\\rceil$.

For the rank problem, we\nexplicitly construct such an approximation, which yields an explicit\nconstruction of the data structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 23:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 02:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

Using anisotropic wavelets we can quantify and\ndistinguish local and global anisotropies and measure the size distribution of\nfilaments. The wavelet analysis does not need any assumptions on the alignment\nor shape of filaments in the maps, but directly measures their typical spatial\ndimensions. In a rigorous test program, we calibrate the scale-dependence of\nthe method and test the angular and spatial sensitivity. We apply the method to\nmolecular line maps from magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and observed\ncolumn density maps from Herschel observations.\n  When applying the anisotropic wavelet analysis to the MHD data, we find that\nthe observed filament sizes depend on the combination of magnetic-field\ndominated density-velocity correlations with radiative transfer effects.

The unbiased view to Herschel column\ndensity maps does not confirm a universal characteristic filament width. The\nmap of the Polaris Flare shows an almost scale-free filamentary spectrum up to\nthe size of the dominating filament of about 0.4pc. For the Aquila molecular\ncloud the range of filament widths is limited to 0.05-0.2pc.

The upcoming X-ray missions will provide such high\nresolution, and will allow spectroscopic diagnostics of clusters beyond the\ncurrent simple thermal modeling. A representative science case is resonant\nscattering, which produces spectral distortions of the emission lines from the\ndominant thermal component. Accounting for the resonant scattering is essential\nfor accurate abundance and gas motion measurements of the ICM. The high\nresolution spectroscopy might also reveal/corroborate a number of new spectral\ncomponents, including the excitation by non-thermal electrons, the deviation\nfrom ionization equilibrium, and charge exchange from surface of cold gas\nclouds in clusters.

In-plane edge\ncontacts have the potential to achieve lower contact resistance due to stronger\norbital hybridization compared to conventional top contacts. However, a\nquantitative understanding of the electron transport properties in the edge\ncontact is still lacking. In this work, we present full-band atomistic quantum\ntransport simulations of the graphene/MoS$_2$ edge contact. By using a Wannier\nfunction basis to accurately describe the electronic bands, together with a\nfull self-consistent solution of the electrostatics, we are able to efficiently\nmodel device structures on a micron scale, but with atomic level accuracy. We\nfind that the potential barrier created by trapped charges decays fast with\ndistance away from the interface, and is thus thin enough to enable efficient\ninjection of electrons. This results in Ohmic behavior in its I-V\ncharacteristics, which agrees with experiments. Our results demonstrate the\nrole played by trapped charges in the formation of a Schottky barrier, and how\none can reduce the Schottky barrier height (SBH) by adjusting the relevant\nparameters of the edge contact system. Our framework can be extended\nconveniently to incorporate more general nanostructure geometries.

In\ncontrast to global segmentation in which all objects are segmented, selective\nsegmentation is used to isolate specific objects in an image and is of\nparticular interest in medical imaging -- permitting segmentation and review of\na single organ. An important consideration is to minimise the amount of user\ninput to obtain the segmentation; this differs from interactive segmentation in\nwhich more user input is allowed than selective segmentation. To achieve\nselection, we propose a selective segmentation model which uses the\nedge-weighted geodesic distance from a marker set as a penalty term.

A convex formulation of the model is also presented,\nallowing arbitrary initialisation.

For example, spin torque oscillators are promising\nbuilding blocks for the realization of artificial high-density, low-power\noscillatory networks (ON) for neuromorphic computing. The local external\ncontrol and synchronization of the phase relation of oscillatory networks are\namong the key challenges for implementation with nanotechnologies.

We experimentally\ndemonstrate this method in a pair of stray field coupled magnetic vortex\noscillators. Since this method only relies on the oscillatory behavior of\ncoupled oscillators, and the temperature dependence of the saturation\nmagnetization, it allows for variable phase programming in a wide range of\ngeometries and applications that can help advance the efforts of high frequency\nneuromorphic spintronics up to the GHz regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 04:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

Following Patrinos (and others, 2018), we express\nthe embedding as the problem of finding a zero of a mapping containing a\nskew-symmetric linear function and projections onto cones and their duals. We\nfocus on the special case when this mapping is regular, i.e., differentiable\nwith nonsingular derivative matrix, at a solution point. While this is not\nalways the case, it is a very common occurrence in practice. We propose a\nsimple method that uses LSQR, a variant of conjugate gradients for least\nsquares problems, and the derivative of the residual mapping to refine an\napproximate solution, i.e., to increase its accuracy. LSQR is a matrix-free\nmethod, i.e., requires only the evaluation of the derivative mapping and its\nadjoint, and so avoids forming or storing large matrices, which makes it\nefficient even for cone problems in which the data matrices are given and\ndense, and also allows the method to extend to cone programs in which the data\nare given as abstract linear operators. Numerical examples show that the method\nalmost always improves an approximate solution of a conic program, and often\ndramatically, at a computational cost that is typically small compared to the\ncost of obtaining the original approximate solution. For completeness we\ndescribe methods for computing the derivative of the projection onto the cones\ncommonly used in practice: nonnegative, second-order, semidefinite, and\nexponential cones.

In such multipolar ARs, the flux tubes may emerge\nsimultaneously or sequentially, each initially producing a bipolar magnetic\nregion (BMR) at the surface. During each flux tube's emergence phase, the\nmagnetic polarities can migrate such that opposite polarities belonging to\ndifferent BMRs collide, resulting in shearing and cancellation of magnetic\nflux. We name this process 'collisional shearing' to emphasize that the\nshearing and flux cancellation develops due to the collision. Collisional\nshearing is a process different from the known concept of flux cancellation\noccurring between polarities of a single bipole, a process that has been\ncommonly used in many numerical models. High spatial and temporal resolution\nobservations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory for two emerging ARs, AR11158\nand AR12017, show the continuous cancellation of up to 40% of the unsigned\nmagnetic flux of the smallest BMR, which occurs at the collisional PIL for as\nlong as the collision persists. The flux cancellation is accompanied by a\nsuccession of solar flares and CMEs, products of magnetic reconnection along\nthe collisional PIL.

In many\napplications such as autonomous driving, failures cannot be completely\neliminated due to the complex stochastic environment in which the system\noperates. As a result, safety validation is not only concerned about whether a\nfailure can occur, but also discovering which failures are most likely to\noccur. This article presents adaptive stress testing (AST), a framework for\nfinding the most likely path to a failure event in simulation. We consider a\ngeneral black box setting for partially observable and continuous-valued\nsystems operating in an environment with stochastic disturbances. We formulate\nthe problem as a Markov decision process and use reinforcement learning to\noptimize it. The approach is simulation-based and does not require internal\nknowledge of the system, making it suitable for black-box testing of large\nsystems. We present formulations for fully observable and partially observable\nsystems. In the latter case, we present a modified Monte Carlo tree search\nalgorithm that only requires access to the pseudorandom number generator of the\nsimulator to overcome partial observability. We also present an extension of\nthe framework, called differential adaptive stress testing (DAST), that can\nfind failures that occur in one system but not in another. This type of\ndifferential analysis is useful in applications such as regression testing,\nwhere we are concerned with finding areas of relative weakness compared to a\nbaseline.

We present here the first\nmodeling of the multi-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of this inner\nregion to better constrain the physical condition of the innermost accretion\nflow. Our modeling uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the\nSED, accounting for the limitations on the accretion rate at the outer radius\nof $10^3~r_g$ from the earlier works and the domination of the accretion flow\nwithin $30~r_g$ to the sub-mm bump.

If only the most luminous part of the\nSED, the sub-mm bump, is considered, the outflow index is about 0, while if\nlow-frequency radio data and X-ray data are also included, the outflow index\ncould be 0.37 or even higher. The great difference of the fitting results\nindicates that the outflow index should be variable along radius, with a strong\noutflow in the outer region and a weak outflow in the innermost region. Such\nweak outflow agrees with numerical simulations and is possible to explain the\nmulti-band SED even better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 06:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Change in fraudulent pattern is because\nfraudsters continue to innovate novel ways to circumvent measures put in place\nto prevent fraud. Limited data and continuously changing patterns makes\nlearning significantly difficult. We hypothesize that good behavior does not\nchange with time and data points representing good behavior have consistent\nspatial signature under different groupings.

In this paper, we\npresent a deep and shallow feature learning network, namely DSNet, to learn the\nmulti-level same-resolution compressed (MSC) features for efficient online\ntracking, in an end-to-end offline manner. Specifically, the proposed DSNet\ncompresses multi-level convolutional features to uniform spatial resolution\nfeatures. The learned MSC features effectively encode both appearance and\nsemantic information of objects in the same-resolution feature maps, thus\nenabling an elegant combination of the MSC features with any DCF-based methods.\nAdditionally, a channel reliability measurement (CRM) method is presented to\nfurther refine the learned MSC features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe MSC features learned from the proposed DSNet on two DCF tracking\nframeworks: the basic DCF framework and the continuous convolution operator\nframework.

Methods: In this work, we\npropose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network - Long Short\nTerm Memory (ANN-LSTM) model for BP estimation. The model consists of two\nhierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses ANNs to extract\nnecessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms and the upper\nhierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation of\nthe features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model is\nevaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical\nInstrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS)\nstandard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic\nblood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Many of these\ntechniques have been developed with a common focus on predicting upcoming\nmedical events. However, while the prediction results from these approaches are\npromising, their value is limited by their lack of interpretability. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce CarePre, an intelligent clinical decision\nassistance system.

We consider a\ngeneralization of this filter, the so-called adaptive bilateral filter, where\nthe center and width of the Gaussian range kernel is allowed to change from\npixel to pixel. Though this variant was originally proposed for sharpening and\nnoise removal, it can also be used for other applications such as artifact\nremoval and texture filtering. Similar to the bilateral filter, the brute-force\nimplementation of its adaptive counterpart requires intense computations. While\nseveral fast algorithms have been proposed in the literature for bilateral\nfiltering, most of them work only with a fixed range kernel. In this paper, we\npropose a fast algorithm for adaptive bilateral filtering, whose complexity\ndoes not scale with the spatial filter width. This is based on the observation\nthat the concerned filtering can be performed purely in range space using an\nappropriately defined local histogram. We show that by replacing the histogram\nwith a polynomial and the finite range-space sum with an integral, we can\napproximate the filter using analytic functions. In particular, an efficient\nalgorithm is derived using the following innovations: the polynomial is fitted\nby matching its moments to those of the target histogram (this is done using\nfast convolutions), and the analytic functions are recursively computed using\nintegration-by-parts. Our algorithm can accelerate the brute-force\nimplementation by at least $20 \\times$, without perceptible distortions in the\nvisual quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for\nsharpening, JPEG deblocking, and texture filtering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 12:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

In recent years, simultaneous considering of nodes'\nattributes and topological structures of social networks in the process of\ncommunity detection has attracted the attentions of many scholars, and this\nconsideration has been recently used in some community detection methods to\nincrease their efficiencies and to enhance their performances in finding\nmeaningful and relevant communities. But the problem is that most of these\nmethods tend to find non-overlapping communities, while many real-world\nnetworks include communities that often overlap to some extent. In order to\nsolve this problem, an evolutionary algorithm called MOBBO-OCD, which is based\non multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (BBO), is proposed in this\npaper to automatically find overlapping communities in a social network with\nnode attributes with synchronously considering the density of connections and\nthe similarity of nodes' attributes in the network. In MOBBO-OCD, an extended\nlocus-based adjacency representation called OLAR is introduced to encode and\ndecode overlapping communities. Based on OLAR, a rank-based migration operator\nalong with a novel two-phase mutation strategy and a new double-point crossover\nare used in the evolution process of MOBBO-OCD to effectively lead the\npopulation into the evolution path. In order to assess the performance of\nMOBBO-OCD, a new metric called alpha_SAEM is proposed in this paper, which is\nable to evaluate the goodness of both overlapping and non-overlapping\npartitions with considering the two aspects of node attributes and linkage\nstructure. Quantitative evaluations reveal that MOBBO-OCD achieves favorable\nresults which are quite superior to the results of 15 relevant community\ndetection algorithms in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 12:09:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 22:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 11:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

However, collecting biomedical data can be expensive\nand/or burdening for patients, so that it is important to reduce the amount of\nrequired data collection. It is therefore necessary to develop multi-view\nlearning methods which can accurately identify those views that are most\nimportant for prediction. In recent years, several biomedical studies have used\nan approach known as multi-view stacking (MVS), where a model is trained on\neach view separately and the resulting predictions are combined through\nstacking. In these studies, MVS has been shown to increase classification\naccuracy. However, the MVS framework can also be used for selecting a subset of\nimportant views. To study the view selection potential of MVS, we develop a\nspecial case called stacked penalized logistic regression (StaPLR). Compared\nwith existing view-selection methods, StaPLR can make use of faster\noptimization algorithms and is easily parallelized. We show that nonnegativity\nconstraints on the parameters of the function which combines the views play an\nimportant role in preventing unimportant views from entering the model. We\ninvestigate the performance of StaPLR through simulations, and consider two\nreal data examples.

With future\nsample sizes of hundreds of planets to come from TESS and PLATO, we develop a\nstatistical method that can flexibly yet robustly characterize these\ncompositions empirically, via the exoplanet M-R relation. Although the M-R\nrelation has been explored in many prior works, they mostly use a power-law\nmodel, with assumptions that are not flexible enough to capture important\nfeatures in current and future M-R diagrams. To address these shortcomings, a\nnonparametric approach is developed using a sequence of Bernstein polynomials.\nWe demonstrate the benefit of taking the nonparametric approach by benchmarking\nour findings with previous work and showing that a power-law can only\nreasonably describe the M-R relation of the smallest planets and that the\nintrinsic scatter can change non-monotonically with different values of a\nradius. We then apply this method to a larger dataset, consisting of all the\nKepler observations in the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Our nonparametric approach\nprovides a tool to estimate the M-R relation by incorporating heteroskedastic\nmeasurement errors into the model. As more observations will be obtained in the\nnear future, this approach can be used with the provided R code to analyze a\nlarger dataset for a better understanding of the M-R relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 12:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

Specifically, we define a super-identity loss to\nmeasure the identity difference between a hallucinated face and its\ncorresponding high-resolution face within the hypersphere identity metric\nspace.

Whenever it is impossible to communicate with the subjects, as in\nstudies with animals or neonatales, thresholds have to be derived from neural\nrecordings. In such cases when the threshold is estimated based on neuronal\nmeasures, the standard approach is still the subjective setting of the\nthreshold to the value where at least a \"clear\" neuronal signal is detectable.\nThese measures are highly subjective, strongly depend on the noise, and\nfluctuate due to the low signal-to-noise ratio near the threshold.

However, there has been only limited algorithmic\ndevelopment to compute or approximate this distance. We focus on computing the\nGromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric trees. Roughly speaking, a metric\ntree is a metric space that can be realized by the shortest path metric on a\ntree. Previously, Agarwal et al. showed that even for trees with unit edge\nlength, it is NP hard to approximate the GH distance between them within a\nfactor of 3. In this paper, we present a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)\nalgorithm that can approximate the GH distance between two general metric trees\nwithin a factor of 14.\n  Interestingly, the development of our algorithm is made possible by a\nconnection between the GH distance for metric trees and the interleaving\ndistance for the so-called merge trees. The merge trees arise in practice\nnaturally as a simple yet meaningful topological summary, and are of\nindependent interest. It turns out that an exact or approximation algorithm for\nthe interleaving distance leads to an approximation algorithm for the\nGromov-Hausdorff distance. One of the key contributions of our work is that we\nre-define the interleaving distance in a way that makes it easier to develop\ndynamic programming approaches to compute it. We then present a FPT algorithm\nto compute the interleaving distance between two merge trees exactly, which\nultimately leads to an FPT-algorithm to approximate the GH distance between two\nmetric trees. This exact FPT-algorithm to compute the interleaving distance\nbetween merge trees is of interest itself, as it is known that it is NP-hard to\napproximate it within a factor of 3, and previously the best known algorithm\nhas an approximation factor of $O(\\sqrt{n})$ even for trees with unit edge\nlength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 15:37:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 16:30:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 14:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

Establishing\ncorrectness of program transformations is technically difficult, and is often\nneglected in the metatheory of gradual languages.\n  In this paper, we propose an axiomatic account of program equivalence in a\ngradual cast calculus, which we formalize in a logic we call gradual type\ntheory (GTT). Based on Levy's call-by-push-value, GTT gives an axiomatic\naccount of both call-by-value and call-by-name gradual languages. We then prove\ntheorems that justify optimizations and refactorings in gradually typed\nlanguages. For example, uniqueness principles for gradual type connectives show\nthat if the $\\beta\\eta$ laws hold for a connective, then casts between that\nconnective must be equivalent to the lazy cast semantics. Contrapositively,\nthis shows that eager cast semantics violates the extensionality of function\ntypes. As another example, we show that gradual upcasts are pure and dually,\ngradual downcasts are strict. We show the consistency and applicability of our\ntheory by proving that an implementation using the lazy cast semantics gives a\nlogical relations model of our type theory, where equivalence in GTT implies\ncontextual equivalence of the programs. Since GTT also axiomatizes the dynamic\ngradual guarantee, our model also establishes this central theorem of gradual\ntyping. The model is parametrized by the implementation of the dynamic types,\nand so gives a family of implementations that validate type-based optimization\nand the gradual guarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 15:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

This is a fundamental hypothesis when deriving the\nself-similar scaling laws in free shear flows, irrespective of turbulence\ndissipation scaling. We show that $L/\\delta$ is indeed constant, at least in a\nrange of streamwise distances between 15 and 50 times the characteristic inlet\ndimension ($L_{ref}$, nozzle width or wake generator size). Furthermore, we\nrevisit turbulence closure models such as the Prandtl mixing length\n\\cite{prandtl1925} and the constant eddy viscosity in the light of the\nnon-equilibrium dissipation scalings. We show that the mixing length model,\nwith $l_m\\sim \\delta$, does not comply with the scalings stemming from the\nnon-equilibrium version of the theory; we instead obtain $l_m\\sim \\delta\n\\sqrt{Re_G/Re_{0\\delta}}$, where $Re_G$ and $Re_{0\\delta}$ are a global and\nlocal Reynolds number, respectively. Similarly, the eddy viscosity model holds\nin the case of the non-equilibrium version of the theory provided that the eddy\nviscosity is constant everywhere, not only across sections orthogonal to the\nstreamwise direction as in the equilibrium case.

To resolve this\nissue, we propose a novel deep learning model for 3D point clouds, named\nPoint2Sequence, to learn 3D shape features by capturing fine-grained contextual\ninformation in a novel implicit way. Point2Sequence employs a novel sequence\nlearning model for point clouds to capture the correlations by aggregating\nmulti-scale areas of each local region with attention. Specifically,\nPoint2Sequence first learns the feature of each area scale in a local region.\nThen, it captures the correlation between area scales in the process of\naggregating all area scales using a recurrent neural network (RNN) based\nencoder-decoder structure, where an attention mechanism is proposed to\nhighlight the importance of different area scales.

I first\narticulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors.\nIn this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly\ninvoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In\nconfronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is\nitself a political stance--a fundamentally conservative one--and why data\nscience's attempts to promote \"social good\" dangerously rely on unarticulated\nand incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how\ndata science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social\njustice.

Yet, the role of the candidate\nprojects' spatial characteristics in the decision-making process has not been\ndeeply considered. Such a limitation, predominately, allows the recommended M&R\nprojects' schedule to involve simultaneously running but spatially scattered\nconstruction sites, which are very challenging to monitor and manage. This\nstudy introduces a novel approach to integrate pavement segments' spatial\ncoordinates into the M&R prioritization analysis. The introduced approach aims\nat combining the pavement segments with converged spatial coordinates to be\nrepaired in the same timeframe without compromising the allocated budget levels\nor the overall target Pavement Condition Index (PCI). Such a combination would\nresult in minimizing the routing of crews, materials and other equipment among\nthe construction sites and would provide better collaborations and\ncommunications between the pavement maintenance teams. Proposed herein is a\nnovel spatial clustering algorithm that automatically finds the projects within\na certain budget and spatial constrains. The developed algorithm was\nsuccessfully validated using 1,800 pavement maintenance projects from two\nreal-life examples of the City of Milton, GA and the City of Tyler, TX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 18:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

The major issue for push-pull direct\nmodeling is the possible inconsistency between the altered geometry of the\nmodel and its unchanged topology. The challenge of resolving the\ngeometry-topology inconsistency lies in ensuring that the resulting model\nremains as a valid solid model and that the model shape follows a continuous\nchange pattern. Although push-pull direct modeling has been implemented in\nseveral CAD software packages, robustness towards generating valid modeling\nresults and continuous shape changes still remains an open issue. This paper\nproposes a systematic method to handle the resolution of any possible\ninconsistent situation. The method formulates the continuous shape change\nrequirement as successive Boolean operations on the model volume, thereby\nguaranteeing valid solid models and continuous shape changes. Further, this\nformulation allows for an easy implementation of push-pull direct modeling\nusing existing CAD research and engineering results.

The average intensity, spectral index of radio emission,\nand the dispersion measure do not vary in connection with BSP outbursts. The\naverage profile obtained from BSPs has the same shape as the average profile\nfrom all pulses. These properties make it difficult to explain BSPs via\nscintillation in the interstellar medium, as a separate emission mode, or as\nconventional giant pulses.

In this context, seamless integration of\nTHz links into existing fiber-optic infrastructures is of great importance to\ncomplement the inherent portability and flexibility advantages of wireless\nnetworks by the reliable and virtually unlimited capacity of optical\ntransmission systems. On the technological level, this requires novel device\nand signal processing concepts for direct conversion of data streams between\nthe THz and the optical domains. Here, we report on the first demonstration of\na THz link that is seamlessly integrated into a fiber-optic network using\ndirect terahertz-to-optical (T/O) conversion at the wireless receiver. We\nexploit an ultra-broadband silicon-plasmonic modulator having a 3 dB bandwidth\nin excess of 0.36 THz for T/O conversion of a 50 Gbit/s data stream that is\ntransmitted on a 0.2885 THz carrier over a 16 m-long wireless link.\nOptical-to-terahertz (O/T) conversion at the wireless transmitter relies on\nphotomixing in a uni-travelling-carrier photodiode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 14:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The aim of this paper is to introduce\nand study the economic Carnot cycles into a Roegenian economy, using our\nThermodynamic-Economic Dictionary. Of course, the most difficult questions are:\nwhat is the economic significance of such a cycle? Roegenian economics is\nacceptable or not, in terms of practical applications?
